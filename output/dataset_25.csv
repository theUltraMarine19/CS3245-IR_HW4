Date: 1918-06-25

and

His Majesty The
King Respondent.

1918: June 25.

Present: Sir Charles
Fitzpatrick, C.J. and Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur J.J.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN.

Criminal law—Indecent assault—Evidence—Complaint
elicited by questions—Admissibility—Corroboration—Criminal Code , s. 1003 .

The appellant was indicted for an indecent
assault on a girl of seven years of age. At the trial evidence was admitted of
the answers given by the girl to questions put by her mother immediately on her
return home after the assault, the mother promising not to spank her if she
told the whole truth.

Held, that the
evidence was properly admitted as corroborating the credibility of the girl
(who told what had happened without being sworn), as required by section 1003 
of the Criminal Code .

Held, also,
that the mother's promise not to punish the child did not make what she said
her ""assisted story.""

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Saskatchewan, rendered on a case reserved for the opinion of the court by
the trial judge.

The appellant was charged with carnally
knowing Olive King, a girl of seven years of age. The evidence shewed that he
met her and another girl of five years of age on the street and brought them
into an empty house where the offence is alleged to have taken place. Both
little girls made statements in court but did not give evidence under oath.

The mother of the girl gave evidence as to
the answers given by her daughter when she was asked to explain the reasons of
her prolonged absence; and the mother admitted having promised not to spank her
if she would tell the whole truth.

[Page 119]

The questions for decision were whether the
evidence of the girl was ""corroborated by some material evidence in
support thereof implicating the accused,"" as required by section 1003  of
the Criminal Code , and whether the statements made by her to her mother were
""spontaneous.""

C. J. Bethune for the appellant cited The
King v. McGivney[1].

Harold Fisher for the respondent referred
to Rex v. Gray[2];
The King v. Daun[3];
Rex v. Scheller[4];
and The King v. Burr[5].

The Chief
Justice:—I am of opinion that the statement of the
child made to her mother immediately on her return home after the assault was
properly admitted. It is true that the mother, irritated and alarmed at the
prolonged absence of her daughter, was obliged to persuade her to explain the
reason of that absence; but nothing that was said can be construed as questions
of an inducing or intimidating character. The child understood that she was
expected to explain the cause of her absence and nothing more.

There is also corroboration in other
particulars, as pointed out by my brother Idington, and I have no doubt of the
sufficiency of the proof of identification.

Davies J.:—The only doubt I entertained in this case of the admission in
evidence of the young girl Olive King's statement to her mother as to what the
prisoner had said and done to her arose, not from the fact that some natural
and reasonable questions were put to the child by her mother which elicited the

[Page 120]

statement in question, but the fact that before
making it the mother had promised not to spank her if she told the whole truth.
I rather doubted whether this promise was not an inducement to make the
statement, depriving it of being spontaneous.

After reading the evidence of the mother and the
two late decisions of the Criminal Court of Appeal, Rex v. Osborne[6], and Rex v. Norcott[7], I am satisfied
the evidence was under all the circumstances properly received. I am also
satisfied that there was sufficient corroboration of the evidence of the child
Olive King to convict the appellant.

The appeal should be dismissed;

Idington J.:—As the majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction,
the only question within our jurisdiction and therefore which we can consider
is what the learned dissentient judge may have expressed as his ground of
dissent.

That if I understand him aright was that there
was no evidence of corroboration which, I take it, means of the story of the
little girl who says she was assaulted, including, of course, the
identification of the appellant as the party implicated.

I think there was sufficient evidence, apart
from that of the other little girl, of corroboration to satisfy the statute.

It consists of many little circumstances which I
think it needless to dwell upon.

The identification of the appellant is the
weakest part of the case and yet so ample that it could not have been properly
withdrawn from a jury had there been one in the case.

I think as part thereof that the mother's entire
story was properly admitted and considered.

[Page 121]

I cannot agree with some of the expressions of
the learned judge who gave the judgment of the court in the case of Rex v.
Dunning[8].
The question of the weight to be given the evidence of those whom the law in a
variety of cases requires to be corroborated varies so much that I should
hesitate to attempt to define the limits thereof or what question may be put by
a mother to her child. The case of Rex v. Osborne[9], illustrates the
problem of admissibility but only governs so far as that case decided. Each
case stands on its own bottom.

Judges must as well as Crown officers ever be on
the alert in cases of this kind to see that there is no ground for suspecting
the good faith of mothers or others in putting forward the charge. The
possibility of inciting the child or other persons to make such a charge as
herein must ever be jealously guarded against.

Once assured of that good faith I should be
sorry to test the admissibility of the evidence by any requirements upon the
expressions a mother may have used in order to elicit the truth.

Of course the possibility of the child being
innocently as it were misled into an assent to the mother's suggestive
questions must be guarded against.

That again may come back to the question of
weight to be given the evidence rather than its admissibility.

I do not think such cases as this must necessarily
be governed for example by the rule against accepting admissions of a prisoner
when induced by some one in authority.

The appellant's identification as the man seen
with the children seems complete and is corroboration which cannot be rejected.

[Page 122]

I should have preferred to have had related so
far as admissible facts and circumstances the facts which led the police
officer to arrest the accused.

The same line of thought which guided him if
founded on circumstantial evidence might have aided the court in coming to the
right conclusion as to the implicating of the accused.

It may, as experience teaches me, have been mere
instinct, as it were, that guided the police officer or that he was told to get
the man seen with the girls on the occasion in question.

In either such case his evidence could not
furnish further facts.

I think the appeal should be dismissed.

Anglin J.:—I think there was evidence in corroboration of the evidence
given by the child. Two witnesses identified the accused as a man who had been
seen with the child not very long before the offence was committed. (Rex v.
Murray[10]). He had no business whatever to be with her. When confronted with
the child, he said:

""You never saw me before—you don't know
me."" This conduct aids in his identification.

The evidence of the child's statement to her
mother was, in my opinion, admissible. It was made shortly after the
occurrence. It was ""spontaneous"" in the sense indicated by Lord
Reading C.J. in Rex v. Norcott[11].
Nothing more than mild persuasion led to its being made; there is nothing to
indicate that it was ""put into her mouth by some one else"" or was not
""her own unvarnished and unassisted story,"" The evidence was not
inadmissible by reason of the fact that ""questions were put to the girl to
get her to tell

[Page 123]

her own story."" Nor does the fact that
""the circumstances indicate that but for the questioning there would
probably have been no voluntary complaint"" justify the exclusion of the
evidence as was suggested in Rex v. Osborne[12].

I would dismiss the appeal.

Brodeur J.:—I concur with my brother Anglin.

Appeal dismissed.

2422659,Ibrahim v R [2014] NSWCCA 160,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: On 14 September 2011 the appellant was convicted after jury trial in the District Court of a charge shortly known as ""specially aggravated kidnapping"" committed on 1 April 2009. ""Specially aggravated kidnapping"" is an offence against s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (see below). On 7 December 2011 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 15 months, with a non-parole period of 5 months. Both the head sentence and the non-parole period have expired. The appellant appeals against the conviction. He has not sought leave to appeal against the sentence.

2At the time of the offence, s 86 of the Crimes Act was relevantly in the following terms:

""86 Kidnapping 
(1) Basic offence A person who takes or detains a person, without the person's consent: 
(a) with the intention of holding the person to ransom, or 
(b) with the intention of obtaining any other advantage, 
is liable to imprisonment for 14 years. 

(2) Aggravated offence A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if: 
(a) the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in the company of another person or persons, or 
(b) the person commits an offence under subsection (1) and at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, actual bodily harm is occasioned to the alleged victim. 
A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 20 years. 

(3) Specially aggravated offence A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1): 
(a) in the company of another person or persons, and 
(b) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, actual bodily harm is occasioned to the alleged victim. 
A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 25 years. 

(4) Alternative verdicts If on the trial of a person for an offence under subsection (2) or (3) the jury is not satisfied that the accused is guilty of the offence charged, but is satisfied on the evidence that the accused is guilty of a lesser offence under this section, it may find the accused not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of the lesser offence, and the accused is liable to punishment accordingly. 

(5) A person who takes or detains a child is to be treated as acting without the consent of the child. 

(6) ... 

(7) In this section: 
child means a child under the age of 16 years. 
detaining a person includes causing the person to remain where he or she is. 
parent ... 
taking a person includes causing the person to accompany a person and causing the person to be taken."" (italics added)

3Having regard to the allegations in the Crown case, the jury was directed on the alternative verdicts of aggravated kidnapping (sub-s (2)) and the primary offence of kidnapping (sub-s (1)).

4It will be observed that the aggravated form of the offence is committed where one or other of the circumstances of aggravation (that the offence was committed in company, or that actual bodily harm was occasioned to the victim) are present; the specially aggravated form of the offence is committed where both circumstances of aggravation are present. The verdict of the jury (guilty of the specially aggravated offence) demonstrates that the jury was satisfied that both circumstances were proved beyond reasonable doubt.

The Crown case

5It was the Crown case that the offence was committed a little after 7.30 in the evening of 1 April 2009. The victim (to whom I will refer as the complainant) was a teenage boy, 15 years and 10 months of age. He lived in a youth hostel in Greystanes. At about 7.30pm he alighted from a bus opposite the youth hostel and began to walk across the road. He was accosted by an adult male who punched him in the face, and forced him into a dark red Holden Commodore and drove him to a nearby park. The punch in the face was sufficient to dislodge a tooth, and to cause haemorrhage of the left eye. During the drive the appellant asked the complainant if he had robbed the driver's house. The complainant replied that he had not. On arrival at the park, the driver told the complainant to get out of the car. As the complainant did so, two other men came on the scene, and took the complainant by the shirt. The men walked the complainant to a nearby house, also in Greystanes. The man who had been the driver of the Commodore entered the house and emerged with a woman who the complainant took to be his wife. He asked the woman if the complainant was the person who had robbed the house. She said he was not. The men released the complainant. One of them gave him $100. 

6It was the Crown's primary case that the appellant was the driver of the car, and was the man who punched the complainant in the face. However, it put an alternative case, that the appellant was party to a joint criminal enterprise, pursuant to which one or more of the three men assaulted and kidnapped the complainant. 

7The complainant returned to the youth hostel where he lived. He told two caseworkers what had happened. The caseworkers contacted police. The complainant was taken to Westmead Hospital and treated. Subsequently, he made a statement to police. (That statement was not in evidence. However, it appears that he gave a description of the vehicle used in the offence, as a dark red or maroon Commodore.) On 3 April police took possession of a dark red Commodore from an address in Hoxton Park. The vehicle was subjected to finger print investigation. The appellant's fingerprints were identified in the vicinity of the front passenger seat. The Commodore was registered to Mr Phillip Kandarakis. At the time Mr Kandarakis was living at Merrylands with the appellant, who was temporarily living apart from his wife.

8It was not disputed in the trial that the Commodore was the vehicle used in the offence. 

9Mr Kandarakis was questioned by the police officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Senior Constable Kanes (who gave evidence under her married name, Prince). Mr Kandarakis told Detective Prince that, at about 5.00pm on 1 April, the vehicle was taken (with his consent) by a man called Nim Ngata, and was not returned until 8.00pm. Detective Prince attempted to question Mr Ngata. He declined to co-operate.

10Between late April and early May Detective Prince spoke to the appellant on a number of occasions. Although he declined to take part in a recorded interview, he at all times maintained that he had not driven the motor vehicle and had not assaulted the complainant. He acknowledged that he was present when the complainant was taken to the house at Greystanes (which was the home of his wife), but said that he believed that the complainant voluntarily accompanied the men to the house. There is no evidence that he disclosed the identities of the other persons with him at the time. He said that he had no reason to believe that the complainant was under the age of 16. 

11At some point, authorisation was given to police to intercept the appellant's telephone calls. On 30 April 2009 he was recorded having a conversation with a friend, Jilbert Murr. The recording of the conversation was before the jury. Although a transcript of the conversation was prepared, there was dispute about one significant passage, and the transcript was not before the jury. Included in the transcript is the following:

""[Appellant]: Fuckin', remember a fuckin' while ago this prick's trying to break into the house wearing black?

[Ms Murr]: Yeah, yeah. Yep. 

[Appellant]: And Karen rang the boys. 

[Ms Murr]: Yep.

[Appellant]: Well the fuckin', I saw this cunt on Merrylands Road wearing black clothing you know what I mean?

[Ms Murr]: Yeah.

[Appellant]: So I thought, I thought it was him. So I grabbed him, I grabbed him and took him back to the house to see if it was him or not, you know what I mean?

[Ms Murr]: Yeah.

[Appellant]: And, and (unintelligible) go 'No it's not him, the wrong bloke'. I give him a couple of hundred.

[Ms Murr]: Yeah.

[Appellant]: I was 'No look sorry but, I've had problems, here, and you fit the description fucken of the guys who was trying to break into the house. And I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.' He said 'No worries mate, I can understand all that.' Blah, blah, blah. Everything was sweet, you know what I mean?

[Ms Murr]: Yeah.

[Appellant]: Now, now they're fuckin', they come and chasing us. They want to know, they, they reckon I'm a suspect for an assault. Assault? I fuckin' didn't touch the fuckin' cunt. I give him fuckin' money and I said sorry. I explained to him what happened. And he was sweet with it. What do you mean assault? Fuckin' ...""

It was the Crown case that this accurately records what was contained in the conversation. (On behalf of the appellant, issue was taken with that part of the conversation where the appellant is recorded as saying ""I grabbed him ..."".)

12The appellant was arrested on 7 May at the home he was then sharing with Phillip Kandarakis. He again declined to take part in a formal interview. He agreed to participate in various forensic procedures. A DNA sample was taken. 

13On 8 May the complainant was formally interviewed by Detective Prince. The interview was video recorded. It began with Detective Prince showing the complainant a number of photographs from which he was invited to select any that represented a person who had assaulted him on 1 April. A photograph of the appellant was included in the array. The complainant selected a photograph. The photograph was not that of the appellant, and was accepted as not being the perpetrator.

14The complainant then gave an account of the events of 1 April.

15On 9 July the complainant was again interviewed. This time he was shown a series of photographs that included a photograph of Nim Ngata. He was again asked to identify any that represented his attacker. He again selected a photograph. It was not a photograph of Ngata. 

The trial

16The complainant's evidence was given, in the first instance, by the jury being showed the video recording of his interview of 8 May. He was then cross-examined. Evidence was also given by the two caseworkers to whom the complainant had reported the attack, by Detective Prince, and by other police officers. Tendered in evidence were photographs of the complainant taken immediately after the events in question, and a medical report of his injuries. 

17On 6 September, the second day of the trial, the solicitor appearing for the appellant said that he had attempted to contact Phillip Kandarakis but was unable to do so. He said that he had asked for police assistance but had not received any co-operation. The subject of Mr Kandarakis arose again on the sixth day of the trial, 13 September. By this time, it appears that some assistance had been provided by police, but the solicitor was still unable to contact Mr Kandarakis. There followed a lengthy discussion in which the solicitor said that the Crown prosecutor had agreed not to make any reference to the absence of Mr Kandarakis. The Crown prosecutor himself said:

""So in short he's a defence witness they are trying to contact and they have tried to contact him, yes, that is so, but the Crown is not making any Jones v Dunkel submission here.""

18The reference to ""Jones v Dunkel"" was a reference to the decision of the High Court in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8; 101 CLR 298. After a good deal of discussion it was agreed that the appellant's solicitor could state to the jury that he had made attempts to contact Mr Kandarakis and that those attempts had been unsuccessful.

19Ultimately, at the close of the defence case, a statement was made in the following terms:

""... I understand that the Crown concedes that the accused's legal representatives have endeavoured to contact Mr Kandarakis with a view to asking him to give evidence at the trial. The accused's representatives have been unable to contact him notwithstanding assistance provided by the police to endeavour to contact him as well. So we are unable to call him to give evidence in our case.""

The defence case

20The appellant gave evidence. He said that, on 1 April 2009, his wife telephoned him, and told him that there was a suspicious looking man lurking around the house. The man was dressed in black. Ms Ibrahim sounded panicked. The appellant told her to stay inside with the children. He was nearby but did not have a motor vehicle. He asked another friend, a neighbour (Ray Awkar) to drive him to his wife's address. They arrived between 7pm and 8pm. He spoke to his wife and children; his wife pointed in the direction she said the man had gone. The appellant walked in that direction, accompanied by Mr Awkar. Mr Kandarakis was also present, but may have taken another path. He saw a car that he recognised as Mr Kandarakis' car. He opened the passenger door and saw a person sitting in the passenger seat who he did not recognise. The driver of the car (who the appellant did not, in his evidence in chief, identify) said:

""I saw him running down Merrylands Road and he fitted the description.""

21The appellant said that he turned to the passenger (who, it was accepted, was the complainant), told him he had had a bit of trouble at his house, and asked him if he had been around the house or around the corner trying to break in ""or anything like that"". He said that the complainant said that he had not, to which he replied:

""Well mate look, I don't know if it's you or not. I haven't looked at the footage ... My wife has got it on camera. Do you mind coming back with me just to see if it's you or not to confirm it's you or not.""

He said that the complainant agreed, and they walked towards the house which was very close.

22The appellant said that because it was dark he could not see the complainant's face properly, but when he alighted from the car he could see that the complainant was taller than he and looked at least 17 or 18 years old. When asked if he had given any thought to the complainant's age he said:

""No not really, I never asked for ID or nothing no.""

23He said the complainant was ""talking nice and calm"" and that everybody was ""talking like gentlemen"". He said the complainant got out of the car of his own free will and accompanied them. He saw no problem. 

24In cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor the appellant said that the driver of the car was Nim Ngata, who was the son of a friend of his, Hussein Ngata.

25The appellant's wife also gave evidence, as did Raymond Awkar and Ms Jilbert Murr. Mr Awkar said that, on the evening of 1 April, the appellant had asked him to drive him to the appellant's wife's home. He did this in a blue Ford Laser. He said that, at the house, the appellant spoke to his wife, and then he and the appellant walked along the path but could find nothing. On the way back they saw the Commodore. The appellant went to the car, opened the door, and talked to the gentleman in the car (the complainant). The appellant asked if the complainant would walk back to the house with them, to which the complainant agreed. They walked together. The appellant's wife said that the complainant was not the person who had been lurking around the house; the appellant apologised for the inconvenience and gave the complainant some money. The complainant declined a lift home.

26Ms Murr's evidence went to the recorded conversation. The disputed part of the transcript was that part in which the appellant is recorded as saying:

""So I grabbed him, I grabbed him""

and 

""I give him a couple of hundred.""

27Ms Murr, who said she was very familiar with the appellant's voice and diction, recalled the appellant saying that ""they"", being ""the boys"" or ""other people"" had done those things. 

28Neither the Crown nor the defence called Nim Ngata. As is apparent from the above, Mr Kandarakis also was not called.

29In his final address to the jury, the Crown prosecutor made reference to the absence of both Phillip Kandarakis and Nim Ngata. With respect to Mr Ngata, he said:

""... the next question that clearly arises is did he [the appellant] know that Nim or the driver whoever it might be and Mr Nim Ngata hasn't come and given evidence in this Court and you haven't heard any admission coming from him through anyone in this matter but he has been named. Whether or not it was him or someone else, the big issue is did the accused send him out perhaps on his behalf and/or if he hadn't sent him out on his behalf when the driver turned up clearly the issue is how did the driver know to take the young boy, [the complainant], to the park. The evidence is completely silent on it. The Crown can't prove one way or the other. Telephone intercepts and all that sort of thing are all very well after the event but this is a crime that's investigated, on the Crown case, after it happens but you may very well think it is a very big hole in the defence case."" (italics added)

30With respect to Mr Kandarakis, the Crown prosecutor said:

""Now, that's what he told the police when his car was taken on 3 April him being approached by the defence doesn't say his absence really adds anything at all to this case and doesn't ask you to draw any inferences from his absence but if he had been called you would expect on the defence case he would have been saying something about how he went with the accused and Ray to the house of [the appellant's wife].

He would have to do some explaining, you might think, about what he told the police that the car went at five, the last he saw of it, and came back to him at eight so where Phillip Kandarakis' evidence would have taken you or not is really just open to speculation. You're not greatly assisted. What you do have is at least what he told the police about the events two days afterwards which was really introduced not by the Crown but by the defence. The Crown put the content in but the fact that he'd said something about Ngata really came from the defence so where that leaves it, who knows.""

31These passages drew a protest from the solicitor representing the appellant. However, the trial judge was unpersuaded that any re-direction was called for. He pointed out that the appellant's legal representative had the benefit of the last address. The solicitor took advantage of that benefit, and said to the jury:

""Now, I don't know why we can't find Phil [Kandarakis] but we can't because if we did we would have him here. He might put some light on how this other person, Ngata got called because we didn't call him ...""

32In his summing up (so far as is relevant to the grounds of the appeal), the trial judge gave clear directions about the onus of proof in respect of Mr Ngata, he said:

""You have heard submissions I think from the Crown as to why Mr Ngata had not been called in the accused's case. It is not for the accused to prove anything in this trial; it is for the prosecution to prove it. There is nothing to prevent the prosecution calling certain witnesses. You must understand that it is the prosecution that bears the burden of proving the guilt of the accused. There is no burden upon Mr Ibrahim at all.""

33During the next adjournment, the Crown prosecutor contended that he had been, to an extent, misrepresented in that he had not made any submission that Mr Ngata should have been called in the appellant's case but had merely stated that the jury had not heard from him. 

34On resumption, the trial judge said:

""I think I might have also overstated in my remarks to you what the Crown had said to you. I did touch upon a remark of the Crown Prosecutor about Mr Nim Ngata. The Crown had not put that the accused had not called Mr Ngata in his case but it merely said that Mr Ngata had not been called and Mr Kandarakis had not been called. As I have said to you there is no onus upon the accused to call any witnesses. The Crown was submitting to you that not that the accused ought to have called the witnesses but that because you have not heard from them, you do not have the benefit of knowing what they would say and therefore you would not speculate.""

35He also gave the following direction:

""The third element is the accused knew the complainant was not consenting to the taking. That concerns itself with the accused's state of mind, and to achieve that the Crown can do either of two things; the prosecution can prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that [the complainant] was under the age of sixteen years at the time of taking. If you find that [the complainant] was under the age of sixteen at the time of the taking and that the accused knew that fact, then if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of those matters, that satisfies the element of the accused's knowledge that the complainant was not consenting. If you are not satisfied that the accused knew [the complainant] was under the age of sixteen at the time of the taking, but you are otherwise satisfied that the accused knew in fact at the time of the taking that [the complainant] was not consenting, then that satisfies that element that the accused knew. So there are two ways that the prosecution can approach that essential element 3. Either of those must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.""

36Later, with reference to the submissions made on behalf of the appellant, he said:

""[The legal representative of the appellant] also submits to you you would not be satisfied for one moment when you deal with the element of the accused's knowledge that he knew the complainant was under sixteen years of age and he submits to you that you could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew [the complainant] was not consenting to come back to the house."" 

37In other respects, the summing up was conventional and has not attracted criticism.

The grounds of appeal

38The grounds of appeal are pleaded as follows:

""1. That the trial miscarried by reason of the prejudice occasioned by the Crown Prosecutor in his closing address.

2. That in the circumstances of the trial, it was impossible for the learned trial judge to give any directions that could have rectified the possible harm occasioned by the Crown Prosecutor's inappropriate remarks to the jury.

3. In the alternative, the directions given to the jury by the learned trial judge in the course of his summing up were ineffective to cure the prejudice that flowed to the Appellant from the Crown Prosecutor's inappropriate remarks to the jury.

4. The defence of honest and reasonable but mistaken belief having been raised by the Appellant, the learned trial judge erred in not properly directing the jury as to the elements of the defence and the burden of proof.

5. By reason of each of the above grounds and by a combination of all of the above grounds, there was a miscarriage of justice and the verdict of the jury is unsafe and unsatisfactory.""

Grounds 1-3: the Crown prosecutor's address

39There are two aspects to the complaint concerning the Crown prosecutor's address. The first is the reference to the absence of Nim Ngata from the trial. The submission was made that the address invited the jury to speculate about why Mr Ngata had not been called in the defence case, and that any evidence that he might have given would have been unfavourable to the appellant. This, it was submitted, was exacerbated because specific reference had been made to why Mr Kandarakis was not called, and therefore that highlighted the unexplained absence of Mr Ngata. 

40Reliance was placed upon the decision of this Court in Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21; 84 NSWLR 581. In that case, a series of 50 questions had been put to the jury by the Crown prosecutor in his final address. The Court considered that the manner in which this was done had the effect of reversing the onus of proof. There is no comparison for present purposes with that case (and nor is any suggested). What is relied upon is the manner in which the Court dealt with the alternative left open to defence counsel. Defence counsel had attempted to deal with the questions. That, however, the Court said: 

""... gave prominence to them and left the jury to ponder whether the Crown's challenge had been met.""

The Court concluded that the appropriate course for counsel to take was to seek discharge of the jury.

41It was argued that that course was not reasonably open to the appellant. That was because the appellant's solicitor had already raised the matter with the trial judge, who had indicated clearly that he saw no difficulty in the submissions made by the Crown prosecutor. For my part, I would accept that the failure of the solicitor for the appellant to seek discharge of the jury should not operate against these grounds of appeal, if they are otherwise meritorious. 

42Moreover, I accept that the comments made about the absence of Mr Ngata, particularly ""... it is a very big hole in the defence case"" ought not to have been made. The submission was a clear invitation to the jury to conclude that there was some obligation on the appellant to call Mr Ngata. ""A very big hole in the defence case"" clearly implied an obligation on the appellant to fill the ""very big hole"". It is a very small step from that to suggest that there is some onus on the appellant. 

43However, I am equally satisfied that, following the trial judge's directions, the jury could have been in no doubt that the onus of proving the appellant's guilt lay squarely on the Crown, and there was no onus on the appellant. Further, the entire issue must be looked at in the light of reality. One clear inference that could be drawn from the appellant's evidence was that the perpetrator of the offence was Mr Ngata. The jury could hardly have thought that he would call Mr Ngata either to admit his culpability, or to deny it. Although the Crown prosecutor's submission ought not to have been made, I am satisfied that it did not cause any damage to the appellant's case, or cause any miscarriage of justice.

44The second aspect of these grounds is the submission put to the jury about the absence of Mr Kandarakis. This has to be seen, in the first place, in the light of the agreed statement to the jury that Mr Kandarakis could not be located.

45The submission put to the jury by the Crown prosecutor is barely (if at all) comprehensible. Ultimately, however, it was that Mr Kandarakis' evidence, if available, would not have added anything to the case. Again, it is a submission that ought not to have been made, particularly in the light of what amounted to an agreement as to what would be said to the jury about the absence of Mr Kandarakis. However, in my opinion, the remarks did no injustice or damage to the appellant's case.

46I am satisfied that, although there was impropriety in the Crown prosecutor's address, it was fully mitigated by the summing up.

47I would reject grounds 1 to 3 of the appeal.

Ground 4: honest and reasonable but mistaken belief

48It will be convenient for the reader if the ground, as formulated, is repeated. It is:

""4. The defence of honest and reasonable but mistaken belief having been raised by the Appellant, the learned trial judge erred in not properly directing the jury as to the elements of the defence and the burden of proof.""

49The ground is therefore based upon an important factual premise. The premise is that ""the defence of honest and reasonable but mistaken belief"" was raised by the appellant during the trial. The ""honest and reasonable but mistaken belief"" was as to the age of the complainant.

50Any such belief is relevant to the present circumstances only by reason of sub-s (5) of s 86. Sub-section (5) creates a presumption that, where the alleged victim of a s 86 offence is under the age of 16, any ""taking or detaining"" is without consent (subject to a further statutory exception, presently irrelevant, in sub-s (6)).

51It is necessary, for the Crown to prove an offence against sub-s (1), or its aggravated or specially aggravated forms, that the ""taking"" or ""detaining"" was without consent. It is not so where the alleged victim is under the age of 16. In that circumstance, by reason of sub-s (5), the Crown is relieved of the obligation of specifically proving the absence of consent. Absence of consent is presumed.

52The ""defence"" of ""honest and reasonable but mistaken belief"" stems from the decision of the High Court in Proudman v Dayman [1941] HCA 28; 67 CLR 536. It was restated in Jiminez v The Queen [1992] HCA 14; 173 CLR 572. In the joint judgment (Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) the Court said that, in Proudman v Dayman:

""Dixon J drew a distinction between mens rea as an ingredient of an offence and an honest and reasonable belief in a state of facts which, if they existed, would make a defendant's act innocent. If honest and reasonable mistake is not excluded in the case of a statutory offence, it will afford an excuse for what would otherwise be an offence, although the burden of establishing the excuse will in the first place be upon the defendant. The burden on the defendant is evidentiary only, and the prosecution retains the burden of proving guilt by establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant did not honestly believe on reasonable grounds in the existence of facts which, in the circumstances, would take his act outside the operation of the statute.""

53In CTM v The Queen [2008] HCA 25; 236 CLR 440, the High Court applied that reasoning to offences were the age of alleged victim is an element. In that case, the High Court had under consideration an offence against s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act. Section 66C(3) created an offence of having sexual intercourse with another person of or above the age of 14 years, and under the age of 16 years. The age of the alleged victim was therefore an essential element in proof of the offence. The High Court determined that, in relation to such offences:

""35 ... An honest and reasonable belief that the other party to sexual activity is above the age of 16 years is an answer to a charge of a contravention of s 66C(3). The evidential burden of establishing such a belief is in the first place upon an accused. If that evidential burden is satisfied, then ultimately it is for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not honestly believe, on reasonable grounds, that the other party was above the age of 16 years."" 

54There are two important aspects to this ruling. The first is that an evidential burden is cast upon the accused person to establish such a belief. The second is that, once that evidential burden is satisfied, the onus is on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused person did not honestly, on reasonable grounds, hold the requisite belief as to the alleged victim's age. 

55In the present case, the appellant's legal representative sought a direction in accordance with CTM. He argued that the appellant had satisfied the evidential burden of establishing the relevant belief, and that, therefore, the onus of disproving that belief fell upon the Crown. After some discussion, it appears that the Crown prosecutor accepted that that evidential burden had been discharged. 

56The trial judge did not give any express direction that the obligation was on the Crown to prove that the appellant did not have an honest and reasonable belief that the complainant was over the age of 16. Whether an accused person has discharged the evidential burden will be a matter for judgment in each case. For my part, I have doubts that the Crown concession was properly made. First, it must be noted that there is a distinction between not knowing a person's age, and having an erroneous (but positive and honestly held) belief as to that age. It is also necessary that the belief be reasonable. It is necessary to look to the evidence given by the appellant. For completeness, I will extract the relevant evidence given in chief. It was:

""Q. Now, when you saw this person in the car, had you ever seen this person before? 
A. No. 

Q. Did you give any consideration as to how old they might be? 
A. When I opened the car door the lights never went on and it was pretty dark so really couldn't see, I couldn't see his face properly when he was sitting in the car no. 

Q. What about when he got out? 
A. When he got out he was taller than me, looked like 17, 18 at least. 

Q. How tall are you: 
A. 170 - 155 I think.

Q. 1.55 metres or? 
A. Metres yeah. 

Q. Do you know what that is the old terms?
A. I don't know. 

Q. So did you give any thought to his age? 
A. No not really. I never asked him for ID or nothing no. 

HIS HONOUR: The witness said he thought he was 17 or 18. 

[SOLICITOR FOR THE APPELLANT]: Yes. 

[APPELLANT]: He looked like 17 or 18.""

57There was some cross-examination of the appellant, although it was not directly concerned with any opinion he held about the complainant's age. Throughout the cross-examination, the appellant repeatedly referred to the complainant as ""the kid"". It is true that it may be that this appellation was first used by police when they initially questioned the appellant.

58In my opinion the evidence fell short of asserting any belief by the appellant. When the trial judge misquoted him by saying ""the witness said he thought he was 17 or 18"", the appellant corrected him to say ""He looked like 17 or 18"". In his initial answers to police (evidence of which was elicited by his solicitor) the appellant said that he had no reason to believe that the complainant was under 16. That is very different to asserting a positive belief that he is over 16. He gave no evidence to support either the honesty or the reasonableness of any such belief. 

59In CTM the High Court referred to Jiminez, in which the question concerned a driver of a motor vehicle who had gone to sleep at the wheel, causing a collision that in turn caused the death of a passenger. In the circumstances, it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that the manner of driving was objectively dangerous. Relevant to that was a question whether the driver had had any real warning of the onset of sleep - that is, whether he honestly believed on reasonable grounds that it was safe for him to drive. No such direction had been given to the jury, and, accordingly, the High Court quashed the conviction. The Court declined to order a new trial, although that was not because it found that the accused person had the requisite belief. What is important about the reference to Jiminez in CTM is that the High Court (in Jiminez) tested the question of honest and reasonable belief against other facts and circumstances proved in evidence, giving rise to the conclusion that there was a serious issue to be tried.

60On the facts of CTM, the High Court reached a different conclusion. The appellant in that case had not given evidence, but relied upon an out of court statement that the complainant had lied to him about her age. The High Court noted that there was nothing to support either the honesty or the reasonableness of any belief that he held. The Court concluded that the evidential burden had not been satisfied in that case.

61In my opinion, similar considerations apply in the present case. Despite saying that the complainant ""looked like 17, 18"", the appellant also said that he did not ""really"" give any thought to his age. Even on his own version of events, it is an irresistible inference that that is the true position. Initially, he said that he had no reason to believe that the complainant was under 16 years of age. This evidence is, in my opinion, insufficient to discharge the evidential burden of establishing an actual belief, as distinct from a mere observation of the complainant's appearance.

62The trial judge gave the directions set out above (at [35]). He made it clear that the onus was on the Crown to prove that the appellant knew that the complainant was under the age of 16. But he made no reference to the appellant's evidence on the subject.

63In my opinion, ground 4 is based on a false premise. It was not necessary for the judge to give any direction in accordance with CTM.

64However, as I have said, at trial the Crown prosecutor ultimately appeared to accept otherwise. He accepted that CTM applied, and he accepted that the appellant had discharged the evidential burden. 

65It is also worth considering what factual directions the trial judge could have given had he directed with respect to the honest and reasonable but mistaken belief. He would have referred to the evidence set out above ([22]) - including the evidence that the appellant gave no thought to the complainant's age (as well as the evidence that he looked about 17 or 18). He would have been obliged to direct that there was no evidence by which to test the honesty of any such belief. He would have been obliged to direct the jury to examine the photographs of the complainant taken at the hospital. 

66Examination of the reasonableness of any belief includes consideration of the thought - if any - which was given to the question. 

67In my opinion, there was no error in the manner in which the trial judge directed the jury. 

68I would reject ground 4 of the appeal.

Ground 5: 

69As is apparent from its terms, ground 5 is dependent upon the outcome of grounds 1-4. Ground 5 should, accordingly, be rejected.

70I would dismiss the appeal against conviction.

71The order I propose is:

(1) Appeal against conviction dismissed.

72HIDDEN J: I agree with Simpson J.

73HAMILL J: I have had the opportunity of reading the judgment of Simpson J. I agree with her Honour's conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed and I agree with her Honour's reasons for that decision. 

74I wish to add some observations in relation to grounds 1-3 and ground 4.

75As to grounds 1-3, I agree with Simpson J that the prosecutor's comments were inappropriate and apt to encourage the jury to reason from the basis that there was an onus on the appellant to fill ""the very big hole"" which arose as the result of neither party calling the witness Ngata. 

76I also agree with Simpson J that the clear and unambiguous directions of the trial Judge removed any possibility that the jury was left in doubt as to the onus of proof.

77There are an unfortunate number of appeals brought to this Court in which the conduct of Crown prosecutors, in adducing evidence, cross examining and in their addresses to juries are said to give rise to miscarriages of justice: see, for example, R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 487; 118 A Crim R 34, R v Rugari [2001] NSWCCA 64; 122 A Crim R 1, R v Teasdale [2004] NSWCCA 91; 145 A Crim R 345, R v Attallah [2005] NSWCCA 277, KNP v R [2006] NSWCCA 213; 67 NSWLR 227, Livermore v R [2006] NSWCCA 334; 67 NSWLR 659, Causevic v R [2008] NSWCCA 238, Anderson v R [2010] NSWCCA 130; 202 A Crim R 68, Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21; 84 NSWLR 581, Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131; 224 A Crim R 22, Armstrong v R [2013] NSWCCA 113, Lyndon v R [2014] NSWCCA 112.

78The cases referred to in the last paragraph are but a selection of cases in which this Court has found that the conduct of a Crown prosecutor, particularly in their closing addresses, was inappropriate, improper or calculated to create unfairness for the accused. It needs hardly be said that such conduct is inconsistent with the role and duty properly entrusted to Crown prosecutors in the criminal justice system in Australia. 

79Of course, this is a relatively small number of cases compared to the vast number of trials that are conducted in this state. Overwhelmingly, prosecutors conduct themselves within the ethical boundaries and with appropriate deference to their role and duties. 

80In terms of closing addresses, the following are examples of the kinds of comments that have been held to be improper or inappropriate:

(i)Comments inserting the personal opinions of the prosecutor into the proceedings.
(ii)Intemperate or inflammatory comments tending to arouse prejudice and emotion. 
(iii)Submissions based upon material not established by the evidence.
(iv)Comments which belittle or ridicule the defence case. 
(v)Attempts to impugn a witness in circumstances where the witness was not afforded the opportunity of responding to an attack upon their credit.
(vi)Comments which have a tendency to invert the onus of proof or water down the standard of proof. 

The first five of those categories were referred to in the judgment of the Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Johnson and Latham JJ) in Livermore v R at [31]. The sixth was discussed in Wood v R and is the kind of inappropriate comment that was made in this case. Inappropriate comments are not limited to those six categories. 

81Addressing the jury in these ways is inconsistent with the ethical obligations arising under the Rules of the New South Wales Bar Association and the advocacy rules of the New South Wales Law Society. There are specific rules directed to the conduct of prosecutors. Those rules have been emphasised in a number of the cases. 

82There is no doubt that the responsibility cast upon prosecutors is a heavy one and the criminal justice system and the community expects prosecutors to conduct themselves firmly and fearlessly by providing a robust presentation of the case. The successful prosecution of offenders depends on such conduct. But as Hunt CJ at CL said in a different context:

""Crown prosecutors should not let their understandable distaste for the factual situations of the individual case become zealotry in a misguided belief that convictions must be obtained at any cost. They have a duty to ensure that trials will be fair to the accused ..."" 

(Kennedy v R (1997) 94 A Crim R 341 at 353.)

83Prosecutors should be aware that each time they exceed the legitimate boundaries of robust advocacy they create the real risk that the trials in which they appear may be subject to scrutiny and the convictions recorded may be quashed. This results in great distress for the alleged victims of the offences and significant cost to community in the conduct of re-trials. 

84Prosecutors should also be aware that such conduct may result in disciplinary action. I do not mean to suggest that the present case is one in which there should be, or is likely to be, disciplinary action. The transgression was not, relatively speaking, egregious and appeared to be the result of inadvertence or clumsiness rather than design. 

85Having made those observations, I repeat that I am in complete agreement with the conclusion of Simpson J that the directions of the trial judge in this case, including the directions and re-directions given specifically in relation to the prosecutor's address, were ample to ensure that the jury did not proceed on an erroneous understanding of the onus of proof.

86In relation to the fourth ground of appeal, I agree with Simpson J that the evidence of the appellant fell short of positively asserting an honest and reasonably held belief that the complainant was under the age of 16 years.

87In the critical passage of the evidence the appellant said that the complainant ""looked like 17, 18 at least' but he did not assert that he had any particular belief as to the complainant's age. On the contrary, when asked whether he gave any thought to his age he said ""no, not really"". The solicitor appearing for the appellant at the trial did not lead evidence as to the appellant's belief as to the complainant's age. 

88Further, as Senior Counsel for the respondent pointed out, the solicitor appearing at the trial agreed to the directions on the issue of consent before they were given and made no complaint after they were given. The lengthy discussion on this issue was not so much concerned with honest and reasonable belief as it was with the question of whether the prosecution needed to prove, not only that the complainant was under the age of 16, but also that the appellant knew that he was under the age of 16. The concession made by the Crown was that the prosecution had to prove both of those things. 

89On 8 September 2011 the following exchange is recorded:

""HIS HONOUR: But the Crown is putting this proposition that he says as regards consent he has - there's two limbs that he has to prove on consent. One that the child did not consent but two that Mr Ibrahim knew the child wasn't consenting.

The Crown says subsection 5 allows him to establish that by operation of the section once he establishes the age but the second limb to prove in the absence of knowledge, he has to satisfy the jury that Mr Ibrahim knew. No shifting of the onus to you at all.

[DEFENCE]: I am happy with that.""

90On 13 September 2011 the trial Judge told counsel what he proposed to say to the jury on this issue:

""HIS HONOUR: ... But the next provision is the area where I've had time to reflect upon what was urged upon me and I'm not certain that this is in agreement and that is the mental element of the accused. The accused knew that the complainant was not consenting to the taking. The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt,

1. The accused knew that the complainant was under the age of 16 years at the time of taking, or if not satisfied the accused knew the complainant was under the age of 16 years at the time of the taking the accused knew in fact at the time of the taking that the complainant was not consenting to the taking.""

91The Crown said that he was ""content with that formulation"". No complaint was made by the appellant's representative. Shortly thereafter the following exchange occurred:

""HIS HONOUR: There's two ways the prosecution can prove the accused's mental element, one when he's taking he knows the child, for example that example that I gave is 10, he knows it's under 16--

[DEFENCE]: Yes. Sure.

HIS HONOUR: Then he can't say that I thought the 10 year old was consenting. There's plenty of evidence here that says he had no idea this person was under 16--

[DEFENCE]: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: --indeed others seem to support that. But if the Crown can't prove that, if the Crown can prove your client knew, actually knew, that there was no consent then that's sufficient to prove the element.

DEFENCE: Yes."" 

92The solicitor appearing did not at this point ask the Judge to direct the jury that the Crown had to disprove that his client was mistaken as to the age of the complainant. Given the state of the evidence, that is not surprising. The appellant's evidence was that he did not really think about the age of the complainant. 

93I agree with Simpson J that ground 4 should be rejected.

		15 August 2014",2014-08-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2422664,Matthew Soames v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 158,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Rothman J. 
2ROTHMAN J: Matthew Soames, the applicant, applies for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by the District Court on 8 March 2013. The applicant pleaded guilty to two charges, one for knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985, and the second being for supply of a prohibited drug, also contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985. 
3For the first offence, the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 3 years non-parole period, with a further 3 years.  For the second offence, her Honour imposed 5 years non-parole period, with a further 4 years.  The sentences were accumulated by 12 months, providing for an overall sentence of 6 years non-parole period and a further 4 years for which the applicant is eligible for parole.
Grounds of Appeal
4The applicant relied on an initial version of the grounds of appeal (filed 2 October 2013), which grounds of appeal were supplemented at or just prior to the hearing, leave to file same being granted by the Court. 
5The initial grounds of appeal were:
(1)Her Honour erred in not giving effect to her findings of special circumstances;
(2)Her Honour gave insufficient weight to the applicant's special circumstances, dependent family, youth, rehabilitation since offending and the accumulative effect of the sentence;
(3)Her Honour failed to apply the totality principle in relation to the sentences imposed;
(4)The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, collectively and individually;
(5)Her Honour erred in not properly considering the issue of parity when sentencing the applicant. 
6The additional grounds of appeal were in the following terms:
1(a): Her Honour erred in not applying a constant ratio of 50% with respect to the non-parole period and additional term as to Count 2 and the total non-parole period and total sentence, having applied it to Count 1. 
4(a): The sentence imposed in respect of Count 2 was incommensurate with the sentence imposed in respect of Count 1, having regard to the findings of similar levels of criminality with respect to each count;
4(b): Her Honour erred in finding that the first offence and the second offence were ""just below mid-range"" and ""mid-range"" respectively. 
Facts
7The sentence proceeded on agreed facts, prepared by the Crown Prosecutor, which formed part of Exhibit A, the Crown Bundle on sentence. The following facts were taken essentially from those agreed facts, which were summarised by her Honour, the sentencing judge, in her Remarks on Sentence. All of the detail is not relevant to the sentence appeal and I will briefly summarise the most pertinent remarks. 
8Conduct for which the applicant was convicted in relation to Count 1 involves a transaction of 24 kilograms of pseudoephedrine tablets. Pseudoephedrine is used in the manufacture of methyl-amphetamine. 
9Three associates of the applicant (Brian, Daniel and Matthew Grover) instructed the applicant to collect the tablets and deliver them to an address in the North Coast of New South Wales. 
10For reasons related to his wife's unavailability and the need to undertake family duties, the applicant was unable to travel to the North Coast to deliver the precursor drug and the applicant asked his father to deliver it for him, which he did. The father drove the applicant's motor vehicle and during the journey was contacted by the applicant who had been in contact with one or other of the associates regarding various issues with the tablets (for example, packaging, weight and like issues). The communication also occurred in reverse, namely, a response from the applicant's father to the applicant and then to the other associate. 
11In this offence, the applicant acted as a communicator between the three associates and his father. Further, as is obvious from the foregoing, the applicant acted in some minor ways as an organiser or arranger of incidental issues. 
12The father delivered the drugs, picked up monies for payment for the drugs and returned to Sydney, where upon he was arrested. The father made it clear he was acting on behalf of his son and did so because the applicant needed the money and the father did not want the applicant to get into trouble. 
13In relation to Count 2, the drug in question was, once more, pseudoephedrine. This time the amount of drugs was 22.6 kilograms. 
14The applicant collected a rental car, paid for by Brian Grover, and drove, with Brian Grover, to a café owned by Brian Grover. Daniel and Brian Grover, together with the applicant, entered a shipping container and later emerged with a bag that was placed in the hire car. The applicant then drove the hire car away, travelling to the agreed point of sale. 
15The bag contained eight resealable bags containing ""cold and flu tablets"" with the symbol ""3K"". The symbol, 3K, was written on the outside of each bag. 
16The applicant admitted knowledge of the tablets; that they could be used to make drugs; and he was to be paid ""a couple of thousand dollars"" to drive them to Tweed Heads. 
17There are subjective factors relevant to the sentence and, given the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate that I briefly summarise those subjective circumstances. The offender was 31 at the time of the commission of the offence; he left school after completing the School Certificate; and has been employed in unskilled labouring and in the retail industry. 
18Late in 2008, his brother was arrested for unrelated matters and the applicant wanted to raise funds to assist with the payment of his brother's legal fees. That was the motivation for the criminal enterprise. 
19It seems that the applicant was depressed as a consequence of what he considered to be an unjust accusation against his brother. His brother was subsequently convicted. 
20The applicant maintains that he was unaware of the criminal involvement in drugs of any of the Grover brothers. 
21The applicant's partner works as a nurse and, for that purpose, works rotating shifts and is the primary income source for the family. The applicant is the sole source of childcare when his partner or her family cannot accommodate the needs of the children. The applicant's partner is struggling with income and childcare arrangements and has been, since prior to the time of sentencing when the applicant had been in custody, bail refused. 
22There is, despite reasonable attempts having been made to manage, real fear (that existed at the time of the sentencing hearing) that the family may lose their home as a consequence of the incarceration of the applicant. 
23Since his imprisonment, the applicant has completed a project dealing with the dangers of drugs and its effect upon the community, including the use of pseudoephedrine in the manufacture of methyl-amphetamine.
24No complaint is made as to the summary, by the sentencing judge, of the subjective circumstances applicable to the applicant. The applicant has no prior record and is entitled to a degree of leniency associated with first offences. 
Grounds 1 and 1(a): Special Circumstances 
25The original grounds of appeal, which alleged error on the part of the sentencing judge by not giving effect to findings of special circumstances, is simply untenable. 
26Her Honour came to a conclusion that special circumstances existed, warranting a departure from the statutorily prescribed ratio between non-parole period and the remainder of the term. As a consequence of that finding her Honour fixed a non-parole period for Count 1, which was 50% of the total term of imprisonment and a non-parole period for Count 2, which was 55% of the total period. 
27The overall sentence imposed reflected a ratio under which the non-parole period was 60% of the head sentence. In each case, the non-parole period is a shorter time of compulsory imprisonment than would have been imposed were her Honour to have implemented the statutory ratio, instead of her Honour's finding that there were special circumstances. 
28The additional ground 1(a) somewhat ingeniously seeks to overcome the fundamental flaw in the original submission by drawing attention to the discrepancy in ratios implemented in relation to Counts 1, 2 and the overall sentence. 
29The difficulty with the submission in ground 1(a), being that her Honour erred in not applying a constant ratio of 50% with respect to the non-parole period and additional term as to both Count 2 and the total sentence, is that non-parole periods are not the result of an arithmetically precise application of percentages. The task of the sentencing judge is fundamentally intuitive and must adhere to the purposes in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing and Procedure) Act 1999. 
30Ultimately, the task of a sentencing judge, when imposing a custodial sentence, is to assess an appropriate sentence, pursuant to the implementation of the purposes of sentencing established in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing and Procedure) Act and discussed by the High Court in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465. Those purposes are served by the determination and imposition of a non-parole period that is appropriate, overall, to the offence committed and the offender who has committed it. 
31Special circumstances do not permit a court to reduce a non-parole period below that which is necessary to reflect the purposes of sentencing, earlier described, including punishing the offender and acting as a deterrent to others. As a consequence, notwithstanding the finding that special circumstances exist, a sentencing judge may not reduce the non-parole period ratio at all, or may reduce it only by a small amount: R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264. 
32The finding of special circumstances is a ""discretionary finding of fact"": R v El-Hayek [2004] NSWCCA 25; (2004) 144 A Crim R 90. 
33Two obvious examples make clear the fallacy associated with the submission contained in ground 1(a). First, this Court has often stated that special circumstances may be disclosed because of the effect of accumulation. Such special circumstances are reflected, usually, by a reduction in the non-parole period in the sentence imposed that will operate last in time. Thus, in those circumstances, only that sentence may be the subject of a reduction in the non-parole period from the statutory prescription and the percentage ratio is not reflected in any other sentence. 
34Further, the purpose of a non-parole period is the imposition of a sentence that is appropriate and the recognition that a period of parole may need to be longer than might otherwise be prescribed by the legislature. If the sentencing judge were to take the view that, in a hypothetical example, a longer period of parole should be available, she or he may fix a period of,  say, 4 years and that period will have a different ratio to each of the offences and head sentences that may be otherwise imposed.  
35In short, there is no principle that requires a sentencing judge to impose a uniform ratio between the non-parole period and head sentence for each of the offences for which a sentence is being imposed. This ground of appeal must fail. 
Ground 2: Insufficient Weight to Subjective Circumstances 
36Much of the discussion in relation to grounds 1 and 1(a) is relevant to an understanding of why this ground must also fail. The fixing of special circumstances is part of the intuitive synthesis in sentencing offenders. 
37Her Honour found special circumstances, which, as earlier stated, is ""a discretionary finding of fact"". The applicant was a first offender, which required some special consideration; he had a dependent family; and there were good prospects of rehabilitation. But none of them mandate a particular finding either of special circumstances or of special circumstances reflected in a particular non-parole period.
38In my view, error of the kind that is necessary to disturb the fixing of a sentence has not been disclosed by any matter put on behalf of the applicant under this ground: see House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505, per Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ. 
39One other aspect should be the subject of note in relation to this ground. The applicant relies on his ""youth"". The applicant was 31 years of age at the time of the commission of the offence and 33 years of age at the time at which the sentence was imposed. In my view, no special consideration is deserved in relation to the applicant's age. 
Ground 3: Totality
40As submitted by the applicant, it is uncontroversial that a sentencing judge is bound by the principle of totality in determining an overall sentence that is just and appropriate to the total criminality of the offending behaviour. 
41Partly, the proposition is uncontroversial because the sentencing judge remarked (Remarks on Sentence at 13-14), that ""there must be partial accumulation of the sentences to reflect the principles of totality"". Her Honour, expressly, applied those principles and was, clearly, mindful of them. 
42As such, the ground of appeal must necessarily be read and considered not as alleging a failure to apply the principle, but as an allegation that the principle was misapplied. The difficulty with such a submission is that, as earlier explained, the intuitive synthesis exercise involved in sentencing an offender is ""the exercise of a judicial discretion by the court imposing it"": House v R, supra. 
43As such, an appeal against such an exercise is constrained by well-established principles. It is insufficient for the Court, sitting on appeal, to consider that a different sentence would have been imposed from that of the sentencing judge. 
44The foregoing should not be taken as an indication that I consider a different sentence is warranted. Rather, it points to the well-known proposition that the Court of Criminal Appeal sits as a court of error and an applicant for leave to appeal is required to show that the sentencing judge has acted upon wrong principle; allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide the exercise of discretion; has mistaken the facts; has not taken into account a material consideration; or some other aspect that satisfies the Court that the determination made by the sentencing judge should be the subject of intervention. Such an error can be disclosed by express statements of the sentencing judge, or because the result reflects, manifestly, error of that kind. 
45The principle to be applied is that any offender who is to be sentenced must be sentenced in a manner that reflects the total criminality of the crimes committed. This can be done in a number of ways but most commonly it is done by an application of the process described by the High Court in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610, namely, the fixing of a separate sentence for each offence for which a sentence is to be imposed and determining the degree of concurrency or accumulation. 
46In Mill v R [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59, the High Court made clear that the totality principle is a recognised principle of sentencing formulated to assist a court in the discretionary exercise that occurs when sentencing an offender: Mill at 62. The circumstances with which the High Court was dealing in Mill was the imposition of a sentence in one State, many years after the offence had been committed, in circumstances where the offender had committed other offences in another jurisdiction and served sentences that had delayed the imposition of the impugned sentence. The High Court took the view that the proper approach was to enquire what would have been the total sentence imposed, if all the sentences in each of the jurisdictions had been committed and sentenced at the one time. Again, it required an assessment of the totality of the criminal conduct and an appropriate sentence for that totality. 
47In Johnson v R [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616, the High Court made clear that there was no inconsistency between the approach adopted by it in Mill, supra, and in Pearce, supra. 
48As described by the High Court (Gummow, Callinan & Heydon JJ), the approach to sentencing in relation to multiple offences is to fix appropriate penalties for each offence, then consider the application of the totality principle and, particularly, whether there needs to be an adjustment to either of the sentences imposed to achieve the total effective sentence consistent with the application of the principle. This can be done either by lowering one of the sentences or by the degree to which the sentences are rendered concurrent or cumulative: Johnson at [12]. 
49The sentencing judge, in this matter, fixed, subject to what may follow from the next ground, an appropriate sentence for each count and accumulated the sentences by 12 months. Her Honour plainly had in mind the issue of totality and the fixing of an overall sentence that reflected her Honour's view of the criminality of the conduct as a total concept. 
50Nothing has been put that discloses an error of the kind that warrants intervention by this Court and the ground must fail. 
Grounds 4, 4(a) and 4(b): Manifest Excess, Either Individually or Collectively 
51The grounds of appeal in this regard agitate manifest excess; an inconsistency between the sentence imposed in relation to Count 2 and Count 1 that is irrational or inappropriate; and an error in fact finding in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences as ""just below mid-range"" and ""mid-range"" respectively. I will deal with the issues in reverse order. 
52Her Honour, in the course of her Remarks on Sentence, classified the objective seriousness of the offending as just below mid-range for the first offence and mid-range for the second offence. 
53The offence under s 25(2) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. Her Honour imposed a sentence, as earlier described, of 3 years non-parole period, with a further 3 years for the first offence and 5 years non-parole period, with a further 4 years for the second offence, accumulating them by 12 months and providing for an overall sentence of 6 years non-parole period and a further 4 years for which the applicant is eligible for parole. 
54As a consequence of the foregoing recitation of the maximum sentences and standard non-parole period as compared to the sentences imposed, it is obvious that her Honour did not impose a sentence that was ""mid-range"" or ""just below mid-range"", if one were referring, in that taxonomy, to the totality of offences caught by the provisions of s 25(2) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act. 
55In the context of the discussion by her Honour in her Honour's Remarks on Sentence, it is obvious that her Honour was referring to a mid-range offence for a courier in the drug trade caught by the provisions of s 25(2) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act. If that were her Honour's intention, which, in my view, it was, then the description of the objective seriousness of the applicant's offence is relatively accurate and certainly open to her Honour. In my view, to suggest that her Honour was assessing the applicant's behaviour on the basis of the mid-range objective seriousness for all offences covered by s 25(2) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act is to misunderstand her Honour's intention. In my view, her Honour's intention is as described above and is, on that basis, not amenable to intervention or interference. 
56The complaint described in Ground 4(a) is, essentially, a complaint based upon alleged irrationality in the distinction in the sentence imposed for Counts 1 and 2 respectively. There are a number of difficulties for such an approach. First, it is not always legitimate to compare sentences imposed for separate offences, where the process being undertaken by the sentencing judge is one that must, by definition, be informed by the principles of totality, for which issue the earlier discussion above must be considered. 
57Secondly, and most importantly, the conduct of the applicant in relation to Counts 1 and 2 was different. In Count 2, the applicant not only planned the exercise, he collected a hire vehicle for that purpose and undertook the delivery of the drugs, including picking up co-offenders. The drugs were not, ultimately, delivered, only because police intercepted the vehicle and the applicant prior to delivery.
58There was far greater involvement in the process in the second count than there was in the first count and her Honour reflected that in the sentence imposed for each. 
59Lastly, the issue arises as to whether the sentence is manifestly excessive. Manifest excess derives from the principles for the intervention of an appellate court in the discretionary exercise of sentencing that were described by the High Court in House v R, supra. 
60In order to disclose manifest excess, it is insufficient for an applicant to satisfy a court that it would have imposed a sentence that was different or less than that which is being impugned. There is no one correct sentence to be imposed. 
61Rather, an applicant must demonstrate that the sentence sought to be overturned was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"": see Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325. Judges at first instance must be ""allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing is effected"": Johnson v R, supra, at [26]; Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [27]. 
62It is necessary for an appellant, or applicant for leave to appeal, to show error in the sentence passed (either specific error or manifest error) and it is insufficient to justify intervention for an appellate court simply to come to the view that it would have exercised its discretion in a different manner: Markarian at [28]. 
63The foregoing is not an insignificant hurdle. Nothing has been demonstrated that discloses her Honour did not sentence in accordance with the statutory regime in place, nor impose a sentence that was not open to her Honour on the material that was before her. In other words, the sentence imposed was neither unreasonable nor plainly unjust. 
64In my view, this ground or these grounds must also fail. 
Ground 5: Disparity 
65The doctrine of parity on sentencing is a norm of equal justice and an essential element of the rule of law: Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [28]. The principle of equal justice requires, as far as the law permits, that like be treated alike and that differential treatment be meted out to reflect differences between those that are relevantly different: Green & Quinn at [28]; Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 608; Jimmy v R (2010) 77 NSWLR 540. 
66In Green & Quinn, the Court (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) said at [31] and [32]:
""[31]  Because appeals are creatures of statute, the parity principle in appeals against sentence arises in a statutory context. The jurisdictions to entertain such appeals, conferred by statutes on courts of criminal appeal in Australia, are supported by powers to increase or reduce sentences affected by appealable error. In the exercise of those powers in appeals by convicted persons, and subject to the applicable sentencing statutes, a court may ""reduce a sentence not in itself manifestly excessive in order to avoid a marked disparity with a sentence imposed on a co-offender."" The exercise of the statutory discretion is informed by the common law norm. Gibbs CJ said in Lowe v The Queen:
the reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers that the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done.
The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.
[32]  A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders. Where there is a marked disparity between sentences giving rise to the appearance of injustice, it is not a necessary condition of a court of criminal appeal's discretion to intervene that the sentence under appeal is otherwise excessive. Disparity can be an indicator of appealable error. It is also correct, as Mason J said in Lowe, that logic and reality combine to favour the proposition that discrepancy is a ground for intervention in itself. Unjustifiable disparity is an infringement of the equal justice norm. It is appealable error, although it may not always lead to an appeal being allowed. If an appeal is allowed on the ground of disparity, a court of criminal appeal in re-sentencing is not required to achieve identity of punishment. It must have regard to the sentence imposed on the co-offender and give it appropriate weight. In such a case, an appeal to this Court on the question whether a disparity identified in a court of criminal appeal was unjustifiable and called for intervention by that court would also involve review of a qualitative and discretionary judgment.""

67The parity principle upon which the applicant relies deals with two other offenders. First, it draws a comparison with the applicant's father who, in relation to the same offence as Count 1, was given a heavier sentence than the applicant. Secondly, it relates to a comparison with Ms Cook. The above passage is sufficient to dispose of the comparison with Ms Cook. The circumstances of involvement in the offence, of age, background, criminal history and general character warrant Ms Cook's different treatment. 
68Any sense of grievance that the applicant may feel towards the sentence imposed on Ms Cook is not justified. The analysis is objective; not subjective. Further, the sentence imposed upon Ms Cook was a sentence imposed for different offences, albeit within the one criminal enterprise with which the applicant was concerned. 
69The ""irrational disparity"" between the sentence imposed on the applicant and on the applicant's father is not one upon which the applicant may rely. There are two reasons. First, the difference in sentence is not ""irrational"". It may have resulted from the different subjective circumstances of the applicant, compared to his father. Those subjective circumstances include the need to support the applicant's family, the relative youth of the applicant and the like. Further, the father was being sentenced for only one offence, while, as is made clear above, the applicant was being sentenced for two offences. Therefore, a comparison of one of the two sentences imposed upon the applicant with the only sentence imposed upon the applicant's father may not be wholly legitimate. 
70Lastly, and most importantly, the applicant's father had imposed upon him a sentence that was more severe than the sentence imposed on the applicant. The parity principle may be used by an offender to argue for a lower sentence; it may not be used by an offender to argue for a higher sentence. If there be an irrational disparity between the sentence imposed upon the applicant compared to the sentence imposed upon the applicant's father, it is for the applicant's father to complain about it, because it is the applicant's father that has suffered adversely as a result.
71Notwithstanding the foregoing comment, and despite the fact that the applicant does not rely upon it, I should note that a person with a less severe sentence may complain about the lack of parity, where the difference in the sentences imposed does not adequately reflect the relevant difference in the criminal conduct or the subjective circumstances. The applicant does not put that submission. 
72Rather the applicant's written submission puts the opposite, namely, that ""[the applicant's] level of involvement in the joint criminal enterprise did not extend significantly beyond that of Ms Cook or his father"". I have already dealt with Ms Cook. Ms Cook was sentenced for money laundering charges, not drug supply. The applicant's father received a more severe sentence for the particular offence. 
73In Sinkovich v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 90, the Court said:
""[72] The parity principle of its very nature only applies if all other things are equal: R v Martin [2005] NSWCA 381 at [11]. That is not the case here. Lowe was charged with a significantly larger array of offences. This required an adjustment by way of accumulation and concurrency between those sentences so as to meet the principles of totality and proportionality. Lowe also had the advantage, which the applicant did not, of a 25% discount in respect of all the offences.
[73] The test for whether the necessary disparity exists, so as to justify the intervention of this court, is an objective one. In R v Wei Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114, Johnson J (with whom Giles JA and Hoeben J agreed) said:
34 The elimination of unjustifiable discrepancy in sentencing is a matter of abiding importance to the administration of justice and to the community - the issue is whether the particular sense of grievance or injustice is a legitimate one: Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 611 per Mason J. The test for determining the existence of a sense of grievance is objective not subjective. What has to be demonstrated by the person complaining on the grounds of parity is not that he feels aggrieved, but that a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened would see that the offender's grievance is justified: R v Doggett (Court of Criminal Appeal, 24 March 1996, unreported) per Sully J; R v Ilbay [2000] NSWCCA 251 at paragraph 6. That statement of the parity principle has been applied in a number of subsequent decisions: Lewins v R [2007] NSWCCA 189 at [7], Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 308 at [37] and Gurney v R; Willetts v R [2011] NSWCCA 48 at [83].""
74In my view, this ground has no rational basis and must fail. 
Conclusion
75For the reasons outlined above, each of the grounds of appeal should be rejected. I propose that the Court make the following orders:
(1)Leave to appeal granted;
(2)Appeal dismissed.

2422911,Turkmani v R [2014] NSWCCA 186,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with Beech-Jones J.
2BEECH-JONES J:  This is an application for leave to appeal from sentences imposed by the District Court on the applicant for deliberately destroying items relating to the manufacture of prohibited drugs knowing that they would be used as evidence in judicial proceedings and for possessing an item for use in the manufacture of prohibited drugs.
3On 12 April 2013 the applicant was convicted of one offence under s 317(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), namely that on 8 October 2010 with intent to mislead a judicial tribunal in judicial proceedings he destroyed a number of items knowing that they would be required as evidence in that judicial proceeding (the ""first offence"").  The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for ten years. 
4The applicant was also convicted of an offence under s 24A(1)(b) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (the ""DMTA"") of being in possession of a ""drug manufacture apparatus"", namely a condenser, intending that the item of drug manufacture apparatus would be used in the manufacture of prohibited drugs.  The maximum penalty for that offence was also ten years imprisonment and a fine of 2,000 penalty units (DMTA, s 33AB(1)). 
5In respect of the first offence, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of one year's imprisonment to commence on 1 February 2013.  The sentence commenced that day because of a period of time the applicant had spent in custody prior to his conviction.  In respect of the second offence, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years to commence on 1 August 2013, with a non-parole period of eighteen months.  
6The combined effect of the sentences imposed was that the applicant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of three years and six months consisting of an effective non-parole period of two years expiring on 31 January 2015, and a balance of term of one year and six months.
The offences
7The following is taken from the agreed statement of facts that was before the sentencing judge.
8Shortly after 4.30pm on 8 October 2010 the applicant and a female companion purchased a number of items from a laboratory supply shop in Mascot.  One of the items they purchased was  a ""condenser"", as well as some hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid.
9The applicant's companion then drove him from the shop. A marked police vehicle followed their vehicle.  The applicant was in the passenger seat and was observed to handle the items. The vehicle was then parked in the driveway of the applicant's grandmother's house in Chatswood.  The applicant lived nearby.  The applicant and his companion left the vehicle and were asked by police to wait outside.  They ignored the request and walked inside the house.  The officers looked inside the vehicle and saw the laboratory items including the condenser.  The police knocked on the door of the applicant's grandmother's residence.  They were told to leave.  Nevertheless, the police waited at the premises while a search warrant was sought.
10Unknown to the police, the applicant left his grandmother's residence and went to his house.  Some time later, the police and nearby residents noticed smoke coming from the applicant's house.  It had a distinctive chemical smell.  The police looked over a fence.  They saw the applicant and a number of other males standing around a large drum in the back of his premises, placing items on a fire.
11A few hours later the police obtained search warrants to search the applicant's grandmother's residence, the vehicle in her driveway and the applicant's premises. 
12The search of the applicant's grandmother's residence revealed nothing of interest. The search of the vehicle parked in the driveway revealed a number of items of laboratory equipment including the condenser, as well as a foam box containing a bottle of hydrochloric acid and a bottle of sulphuric acid.  The applicant's fingerprints were found on the bottle of sulphuric acid.  An expert witness engaged by the Crown stated that sulphuric acid can be used to reduce liquid methylamphetamine to a solid form.  The statement of facts also recounted that hydrochloric acid can be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine in that it could ""be used to fit joints on glassware used in the process of illicit manufacture"".
13The search of the applicant's premises revealed a number of items relevant to the manufacture of methylamphetamine.  In the laundry the applicant's fingerprints were found on a bottle of methylene chloride (or ""DCM"").  The Crown expert advised that methylene chloride is a solvent that can be used as part of the process used to make a solution called ""L-PAC"", which is a precursor of amphetamine.  Some L-PAC was found on a funnel in the applicant's premises. The funnel bore the applicant's fingerprints.  The Crown expert also stated that the mere presence of L-PAC did not of itself suggest that the process of manufacture had taken place at the applicant's house.  
14Also found in the same bag in the laundry as the DCM was a bottle of toluene and a bottle of acetone.  The Crown expert advised that toluene could be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine in the same manner as DCM and that acetone can be used to remove impurities in the finished product.
15In the applicant's bedroom a flask was found with a separating funnel attached.  The funnel contained a liquid which when analysed was found to contain, inter alia, pseudoephedrine.  The applicant's fingerprints were found on the flask.  Also found in the applicant's bedroom was a print-out of a two page document supplied by ""Chemsupply.com.au"" which listed chemicals and their prices, and a so-called ""ezy"" test which can be used to test the quality of a drug.
16The police also searched the garden shed in the backyard of the applicant's premises.  They found a publication entitled ""Amphetamine Synthesis"" in the garden shed.  Eight fingerprints left by the applicant were found on the document.  A number of bottles of glucose were also found.  The Crown expert advised that they could be used in the preparation of a ""precursor"" to the manufacture of pseudoephedrine known as ""L-PAC"".
17In the backyard the police found a large amount of broken glass and glass fragments that appeared to relate to scientific apparatus.  They also found a smashed laptop.  An analysis of the hard drive revealed that it had been used to access a number of web sites relevant to establishing the process of illicit manufacture of drugs.
18The applicant was originally charged with knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug.  Although various representations were made, it was only on the date that the matter was listed for trial that the Crown accepted that charge could not be made out.  Instead a fresh indictment was presented containing the first and second offences.   This meant that some care had to be taken in dealing with the above facts as they appear to outline much of the evidence that was sought to be relied on in support of the original charge.  I will return to this in dealing with grounds 3 and 5 of the appeal.
The sentencing judgment
19In the sentencing judgment his Honour identified the maximum penalties for each of the two offences and then described the facts of each offence in some detail.  His Honour then addressed the sentencing task as follows. 
20First, his Honour addressed the circumstances of the second offence.  I will return to discuss this when addressing ground 5 of the appeal.  It suffices to state that one of the complaints is that his Honour sentenced the applicant for this offence in a manner inconsistent with the principles stated in R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383 (""De Simoni"").
21Second, his Honour addressed the objective seriousness of the first offence.  I will return to address this, as the manner in which his Honour did so is the subject of ground 3 of the appeal.  Part of the complaint with this ground is that his Honour also proceeded in a manner inconsistent with De Simoni. 
22Third, his Honour addressed the evidence of psychological impairment as set out in a report from a psychologist, Mr Tim Watson-Munro.  His Honour accepted that the applicant had depression and anxiety and considered it ""as part of the general mix of subjective circumstances"".  However, his Honour did not consider that there was any causal link between those conditions and the applicant's offending.
23Fourth, his Honour addressed the applicant's subjective circumstances.  The applicant was thirty-five years of age at the time of sentencing.  He left school at Year 11.  He had an interrupted work history that included stints as a foreman, tiler, and in the smash repair industry.  His Honour noted that the applicant's father had died in 2012 after a battle with emphysema and cancer, and the applicant's mother is struggling in the wake of her husband's death.  The sentencing judge also addressed the ongoing effects of a motorcycle accident in November 2009 which led to a permanent injury to the applicant's knee.  This topic is relevant to ground 2 of the appeal.  I will return to address it.
24Fifth, the sentencing judge addressed the applicant's criminal record.  His Honour noted that the applicant had an extensive criminal history dating back to 1996, which included convictions for assault.  Of particular significance were two sets of convictions concerning the manufacture or supply of prohibited drugs.  On 25 March 2002 the applicant was convicted of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. This offence was committed in 1997.  Also on 25 March 2002 he was convicted of manufacturing a prohibited drug. This offence was committed in June 2000.  He received substantial custodial sentences for those offences.  Further, in 2007 the applicant was convicted of, inter alia, supplying a prohibited drug. For that offence he was sentenced to two years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months.   He was released on parole for that and other offences on 16 September 2008. 
25Sixth, the sentencing judge indicated that he would take into account the expressions of remorse that the applicant had made to others.
26Seventh, his Honour addressed the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation.  His Honour noted the applicant's persistent criminal history.  Nevertheless, his Honour found that there were ""prospects [that] the offender's rehabilitation will be enhanced"".  On this basis, his Honour found ""special circumstances"".
27Eighth, his Honour noted the history of the matter, including the timing of the entry of pleas.  His Honour allowed the applicant the full discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea to the first offence (ie 25%).  For the second offence his Honour stated that it would be a discount ""approaching the top of the range"".
28Ninth, his Honour addressed a submission that, as both offences could have been dealt with summarily, a lesser sentence should be imposed.  His Honour rejected that submission, concluding that it was unlikely that the Crown would have elected to have the offences dealt with in the Local Court.
29Tenth, his Honour took into account the onerous nature of the bail conditions imposed upon the applicant, namely that he was required to report daily and observe a curfew.
30Eleventh, his Honour addressed the totality principle and the appropriate approach to cumulating sentences. Ultimately no complaint was made about this aspect.
31Twelfth, for the reasons already indicated, his Honour addressed the need to backdate the sentence.
Grounds 1 and 4
32At the hearing of the appeal, the Court was advised that these grounds were not pressed. 
Ground 5:  De Simoni and the first offence
33At the hearing of the appeal, Counsel for the applicant, Ms Francis, sought leave to add a further ground to her client's notice of appeal.  The Crown did not object and leave was granted.  It is convenient to deal with it first. The additional ground alleged that the sentencing judge erred by sentencing the applicant in respect of the first offence on the basis of facts which give rise to the more serious offence of intending to pervert the course of justice.
34As noted, this ground seeks to invoke the ""principle"" in De Simoni.  In De Simoni the offender pleaded guilty to a charge under s 391 of the Criminal Code (WA) of robbery.  An element of that offence was that he had used ""actual violence"" (at 387).  In fact, during the robbery he had struck his victim a heavy blow on the back of the head inflicting a wound at the rear of the skull (at 386).  There was an aggravated version of the offence under s 393 of the Criminal Code (WA) if a robbery involved, inter alia, ""wound[ing]"" or ""personal violence"" (at 387).  The Western Australian Court of Criminal Appeal had held that the sentencing judge had impermissibly sentenced the offender on the basis that he wounded the victim and allowed his appeal from the sentence. The High Court restored the sentence on the basis that that characterisation of the sentencing judge's approach was itself erroneous, and the sentencing judge had relied on no more than the fact that the offender ""used violence"" (at 394 per Gibbs CJ).
35Chief Justice Gibbs (with whom Mason and Murphy JJ agreed) articulated the general principle for which De Simoni stands as follows (at 389):
""... a judge, in imposing sentence, is entitled to consider all the conduct of the accused, including that which would aggravate the offence, but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence.""
36However, later in the judgment Gibbs CJ addressed the position where the circumstance of aggravation is also an element of the offence for which the offender is being sentenced (at 393 to 394):
""The application of s 582 leads to difficulty in some cases of robbery. Under s 391, it is an element of the offence that the offender has used or threatened to use actual violence to any person or property. Under s 393 a circumstance of aggravation is that the offender wounds or uses any other personal violence to any person. In my opinion there is no difference between using actual violence to any person, and using personal violence to any person. Actual violence means no more than physical force which is real and not merely threatened or contemplated. Personal violence means violence to the person - bodily violence. Under s 391 the relevant element of the offence may be satisfied by actual violence to property or by threatened violence to the person, and in those cases there will not necessarily exist any circumstance of aggravation. However, the necessary element required by s 391 may also be satisfied by actual violence to any person, and where that is the case the element of the simple offence will also constitute a circumstance of aggravation.  ...
If an offender has been convicted of robbery, and the indictment charges that he used actual violence to any person, it is obvious that the trial judge, in imposing sentence, may have regard to the actual violence that was used, notwithstanding that it would also constitute personal violence within s 393. On the other hand, if the actual violence used resulted in wounding, the trial judge should not take the wounding into account unless it has been charged in the indictment, for the wounding is purely a circumstance of aggravation and not an element of robbery simpliciter.""   (emphasis added)
37This passage reveals the subtleties that can be involved in the application of De Simoni (see McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94; 194 A Crim R 439 at [38]-[39] per Howie J, McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing;  and Einfeld v R [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1 at [135]-[138]). Nevertheless, the emphasised passage in [36] makes it clear, as does the outcome in De Simoni, that the sentencing process will not miscarry if the sentencing proceeds upon facts that merely satisfy the elements of the offence charged, even if one of those elements can amount to a circumstance of aggravation sufficient to found guilt for another more serious offence.  However the sentencing process may miscarry if those facts amount to such a circumstance which is not an element of the offence charged. 
38The difficulties in the application of De Simoni arise in this case. Ms Francis argued that the findings made by the sentencing judge in relation to the first offence would have warranted his conviction for the more serious offence of pervert the course of justice found under s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900 and were thus inconsistent with De Simoni.
39Sections 311, 312,  317 and 319 of the Crimes Act 1900 relevantly provide:
""311   Definitions
(1)  In this Part:
benefit means any benefit or advantage whether or not in money or money's worth.
judicial officer means a person who is, or who alone or with others constitutes, a judicial tribunal and includes a coroner.
judicial proceeding means a proceeding in or before a judicial tribunal in which evidence may be taken on oath.
judicial tribunal means a person (including a coroner and an arbitrator), court or body authorised by law, or by consent of parties, to conduct a hearing for the purpose of the determination of any matter or thing and includes a person, court or body authorised to conduct a committal proceeding.
public justice official means a person who is a public officer employed in any capacity (other than as a judicial officer) for the investigation, detection or prosecution of offenders.
(2)  In this Part, a reference to the making of a statement on oath includes a reference to the verification of a statement on oath.""
312   Meaning of ""pervert the course of justice""
A reference in this Part to perverting the course of justice is a reference to obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice or the administration of the law.
...
317   Tampering etc with evidence
A person who, with intent to mislead any judicial tribunal in any judicial proceeding:
(a) suppresses, conceals, destroys, alters or falsifies anything knowing that it is or may be required as evidence in any judicial proceeding, or
(b) fabricates false evidence (other than by perjury or suborning perjury), or
(c) knowingly makes use of fabricated false evidence,
is liable to imprisonment for 10 years.
...
319   General offence of perverting the course of justice
A person who does any act, or makes any omission, intending in any way to pervert the course of justice, is liable to imprisonment for 14 years.""
40It is unnecessary to undertake a detailed exegesis concerning the differences between s 317 and s 319.  There can be no doubt that many cases that satisfy s 317 may also constitute an offence under s 319.  It follows from the emphasised passage from De Simoni set out above that it is permissible to merely sentence an offender on the basis of facts that meet the elements of an offence under s 317, even if those facts might also constitute an offence under s 319.  However if the factual findings go beyond those elements, then the principle in De Simoni may be engaged. 
41An example of a case in this area of discourse that involved an infringement of the principle in De Simoni was referred to in argument, namely R v Mobbs [2005] NSWCCA 371 (""Mobbs"").  In Mobbs the offender pleaded guilty to one charge of hindering the investigation of a serious indictable offence contrary to s 315(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 in that he falsely told police that he was the driver of a vehicle involved in a serious car accident.  The maximum penalty for the offence was seven years imprisonment.  This Court held that a finding by the sentencing judge, that but for the false statement another person would have been prosecuted for the offence, was one that ""move[d] beyond the elements of a s 315 offence to a s 319 offence so as to infringe the De Simoni principle"" (at [32] per Johnson J, with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed). 
42In this case when addressing the circumstances of the first offence in this case the sentencing judge stated:
""The offender took a number of steps over a significant period of time to destroy pieces of evidence knowing that they would be required as evidence in judicial proceedings.  He sought to take advantage of the difficulties police were under in gaining entry to the property. 
No judicial proceedings were underway at the time. Police came upon the offender by chance.
The acts of the accused were clearly deliberate.  It is difficult to know to what extent the burning of the items of equipment and chemicals hampered the investigations of police, as it would appear that items were totally destroyed by the fire.
The acts were clearly designed to frustrate proceedings in relation to significant criminal activity relating to the preparations for the manufacture of prohibited drugs.""  (emphasis added)
43Ms Francis took particular objection to the word ""frustrate"" in this passage. It was contended that this reference amounted to a finding that the applicant intended to ""prevent"" successful proceedings relating to the preparations for the manufacture of prohibited drugs. It was submitted that this went beyond the admission of the elements of the offence by the applicant. It was submitted that he was only to be sentenced for ""destroying"" certain unidentified objects ""with the coincident intent of misleading a judicial officer, that is, with the intent of engendering in the judicial officer the wrong impression"". 
44The Crown submitted that, although it was unclear, this aspect of the sentencing judgment was no more than a restatement of the elements of the offence under s 317.  Otherwise it was implicit in both sets of submissions that the form of judicial proceeding contemplated by the first offence is a criminal prosecution concerning the manufacture or attempted manufacture of prohibited drugs.
45While it is unclear, in my view the reference to ""frustrate"" proceeding in the above passage from the sentencing judgment is no more than a restatement of the elements of the offence under s 317 to which the applicant had pleaded guilty.  Properly construed, it does not convey that the applicant destroyed the items while possessing a mental element beyond that specified in s 317. It is notable that in the passage from the sentencing judgment noted in [42] his Honour did not refer to the applicant's intention to mislead the judicial tribunal.  This suggests that his Honour was referring to that intention in describing the applicant's acts as clearly intended to ""frustrate"" proceedings. 
46By entering a plea of guilty to an offence under s 317 the applicant admitted that firstly he destroyed objects, secondly that he did so knowing that they were or may be required in a judicial proceeding, and thirdly that  he did so with an intention to mislead a judicial tribunal in that judicial proceeding. In my view it is not inaccurate to describe those three elements, without more, as amounting to the undertaking of acts ""designed to frustrate"" those judicial proceedings.  To deny a judicial tribunal items that may be ""required as evidence"" is to ""frustrate"" that body in the performance of its function, even if it is not ultimately precluded from performing it.  Thus, even if one accepts Ms Francis' characterisation of the relevant intent required to commit an offence under s 317 (noted in [43] above), an intention to engender in a judicial officer the ""wrong impression"" involves an attempt to frustrate the proper performance of that judicial officer's function.
47Accordingly I reject ground 5.
Ground 3:  The sentence imposed in relation to the second offence was ""too severe""
48Ground 3 of the appeal contends that the sentence imposed for the second offence was ""too severe"", that is it was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" (House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505). During oral argument Ms Francis made a subsidiary point in support of this ground, namely that the facts found by the sentencing judge in relation to the second offence meant that the applicant was also sentenced on a basis that conflicted with De Simoni.  I will address that subsidiary point first.
49As noted, the applicant was charged with an offence under s 24A(1) of the DMTA.  The section relevantly provides:
""24A   Possession of precursors and certain apparatus for manufacture or production of prohibited drugs
(1)  A person who has possession of:
 (a)   a precursor, or
 (b)   a drug manufacture apparatus,
intended by the person for use in the manufacture or production, by that person or another person, of a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.
(2)   ...
(3)  In this section:
drug manufacture apparatus means an apparatus specified or described in the regulations as a drug manufacture apparatus for the purposes of this section.
precursor means a substance specified or described in the regulations as a precursor for the purposes of this section.""
50As is to be expected s 24(1) of the DMTA provides that it is an offence for a person to ""manufacture or produce, or knowingly take part in the manufacture or production of, a prohibited drug ..."".  In the case of methylamphetamine, the maximum penalty for such an offence is fifteen years imprisonment (DMTA, s 32(1)(g)).  Section 3 defines manufacture as ""includ[ing] the process of extracting or refining the prohibited drug"".  Section 27 provides, inter alia, that a person who ""aids"" or ""abets"" the commission of an offence under s 24(1) is guilty of an offence under the latter section and liable to the same penalty.
51Further, s 6 of the DMTA provides that:
6   Meaning of ""take part in""
For the purposes of this Act and the regulations, a person takes part in the cultivation or supply of a prohibited plant or the manufacture, production or supply of a prohibited drug or psychoactive substance if:
 (a)  the person takes, or participates in, any step, or causes any step to be taken, in the process of that cultivation, manufacture, production or supply,
 (b)  the person provides or arranges finance for any such step in that process, or
 (c)  the person provides the premises in which any such step in that process is taken, or suffers or permits any such step in that process to be taken in premises of which the person is the owner, lessee or occupier or in the management of which the person participates.""  (emphasis added)
52In R v BD [2001] NSWCCA 184; 122 A Crim R 28 (""BD"") this Court held that the acquisition and transport of chemicals and equipment for the manufacture of methylamphetamine did not, without more, amount to a ""step ... in the process of ... manufacture"" (at [26] per Bell J, with whom Stein JA and Greg James J agreed).  It accepted the distinction drawn by the trial judge in that case ""between preparatory acts and acts which, in truth, represented steps in the process of manufacture"" (at [17] and [26]).
53In this case the relevant part of the sentencing judgment in which his Honour addressed the seriousness of the first offence was as follows:
""Care must be taken to ensure that the rule in De Simoni is not breached.  He was not in possession of a precursor.  Also, as I have already noted, the offender is not charged with an attempt to manufacture a prohibited drug or precursor, or knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug or conspiracy.  The Crown conceded, and it is implicit from the course the matter has taken, that none of these offences could be proved on the facts here.
The Crown concedes, at its highest, the offender was involved in acts of preparation consistent with the decision in R v BD [2001] NSWCCA 184 (T11). Here the obtaining of the equipment and reference to chemical processes in a diary or researches or enquiries on the Internet, if they could be attributed to the offender, could not be described as anything more than preparation for a  future process of manufacture.  It is difficult on the material before me to determine the extent the offender played a role in the acts of preparation leading up to the marshalling of the items found and destroyed on the premises.  It is reasonable to infer from the evidence, including the notations in a diary which contain the offender's fingerprints and the finding of various items in the place they were found that the offender was aware of the scale of the intended manufacture.  A number of items that could be used in the process of manufacture of prohibited drug contained the offender's fingerprints.  Whilst it is the case that the offender faces sentence for the possession of a single item of equipment and had possession only for a matter of hours, it would be artificial to disregard the finding of the other items. Those other items provide the context in which the offender's culpability for possession of the condenser is to be viewed. The preparations for the manufacture of prohibited drug were in an advanced stage.
However, whilst there may be strong suspicion that the offender intended to himself engage in the ultimate processes of manufacture of prohibited drugs, I am unable to conclude to the criminal standard that that is so.
I am of the view that the offender was aware that gaining possession of the condenser was a significant step in what was preparation for the manufacture of prohibited drug of some scale.""  (emphasis added)
54Ms Francis contended that even though the sentencing judge was acutely conscious of the need to comply with De Simoni, these findings meant that the applicant was sentenced on the basis of facts that amounted to an involvement in a more serious offence being either aiding and abetting a manufacture or knowingly taking part in a manufacture. 
55In my view that contention is untenable. The above passage reveals that the sentencing judge was very careful to respect the distinction accepted in BD between acts preparatory to manufacture and the taking of a step in the manufacture.  The facts that his Honour found could not have grounded a conviction of the applicant for an offence under s 24(1), because those facts did not suggest that the process of manufacture or the taking of steps in the process of manufacture had commenced.  
56The balance of the applicant's complaint under this ground was set out in the written submissions filed on his behalf. The applicant pointed to two matters in particular as demonstrating that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or unjust.
57First, he pointed to the fact that the condenser was purchased together with other legal items for a total value of $1,241.62, and that there was no evidence as to what quantity of drug, if any, could have been made from the items seized from the car, nor as to any further items or chemicals that may have been needed to manufacture a prohibited drug.
58Second, the applicant asserted that a review of the statistics that were tendered to the sentencing judge showed that ""prior to the instant case no offender in the District Court had received a full time custodial sentence for this offence and in the Local Court the highest sentence imposed was a sentence of imprisonment of one year"".
59In relation to the first matter, the sentencing judge ultimately concluded that the possession of the condenser was ""a significant step in what was the preparation for the manufacture of a prohibited drug of some scale"".  An assessment of what manufacture the applicant intended the condenser to be used in is not to be undertaken by restricting consideration to the items that were found in the vehicle, but extended to the other material that was found during the search of the applicant's home.  The scale of manufacture that was contemplated, of which the condenser formed part, was clearly not insignificant. 
60Otherwise the resort to sentencing statistics is of no assistance. The limitations upon the use of statistics were described in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54] to [55] (""Hili"").  Further, the premise of the applicant's submission is incorrect. The sentencing statistics that were tendered indicated that there had been three cases in the Local Court under s 24A(1)(b) in the period April 2008 to March 2012, all of which had resulted in custodial sentences.  They also indicated that in the District Court there had been two such cases in the period December 2008 to September 2011, both of which had resulted in suspended sentences.  However there had been also 39 cases under s 24A(1)(a) which prohibits the possession of a precursor chemical, and approximately three-quarters of those cases had resulted in custodial sentences.  There is no prima facie difference in the level of seriousness between an offence under s 24A(1)(a), which prohibits the possession of precursors, and an offence under s 24A(1)(b) which prohibits the possession of equipment for the manufacture of prohibited drugs.  In any event, these limited statistics only serve to illustrate the strength of the comments in Hili at [54] to [55].
61As I have stated, the maximum penalty for an offence under s 24A(1)(b) was ten years imprisonment.  The sentencing judge correctly characterised the level of criminality involved in this offence.  As ground 3 demonstrates, there were some strong aspects of the applicant's subjective case, but generally his appalling criminal record meant that he was not entitled to leniency.  In those circumstances I am not satisfied that the sentence for the second offence was ""unreasonable"" or ""unjust"".
62I reject ground 3.
Ground 2:  Application for leave to adduce further medical evidence
63Ground 2 seeks leave to adduce fresh evidence relating to the health status and treatment of the applicant while he has been in custody. It was submitted that it reveals that the condition of his leg arising from his motorcycle accident has deteriorated while in custody and has not been properly treated. This was said to warrant him being resentenced. 
64The applicant sought to adduce further evidence on the appeal concerning his medical condition on two bases. The first was the so called ""usual basis"", namely that if the applicant otherwise demonstrated error on the part of the sentencing judge, then this material could be relied upon at the point the Court came to re-exercise the sentencing discretion.  As error has not otherwise been demonstrated, this basis for receiving the evidence does not arise.
65The second basis was stated by King CJ in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 588:
""While the evidence sought to be admitted on this appeal in a sense establishes the occurrence of events occurring after the passing of sentence, it does so for the purpose of explaining the full extent and implications of the appellant's condition of health which existed at the time of sentence. I think that the authorities show that it is permissible to have regard to events occurring after sentence for the purpose of showing the true significance of facts which were in existence at the time of sentence.""
66Three examples of the application of this principle are as follows.  Firstly where the offender was only diagnosed as suffering from a disease or condition after sentence but was infected or affected at the time of sentence (e.g. HIV/AIDS as in Bailey v R (1988) 35 A Crim R 458 at 462).  Secondly where, although symptoms of a particular condition may have been present, their significance was not appreciated at the time of sentencing (Iglesias v R [2006] NSWCCA 261 (""Iglesias"");  see Springer v R [2007] NSWCCA 289; 177 A Crim R 13 at [3] per McClellan CJ at CL) (""Springer"").  Thirdly where a person was sentenced on the expectation that they would receive a particular level of medical care and attention in custody but they did not (R v Keir [2004] NSWCCA 106; Springer id).
67To address this ground it is first necessary to outline the material before the sentencing judge before considering the further evidence sought to be relied on.
68Before the sentencing judge there was tendered a report from Dr Albina Della Bruna.  Dr Della Bruna has been the applicant's general practitioner since 2006.  She stated that the applicant had been admitted to hospital on 25 November 2009 after a motor bike accident, and had surgery performed on his left knee.  She describes a series of further attendances by the applicant at hospital seeking medical treatment for persistent infections of his left knee. This included surgery for the debridement of a fistula.
69Dr Della Bruna also stated that the applicant had suffered two further motor vehicle accidents on 17 November 2011 and 25 November 2011, which had exacerbated the condition of the applicant's left knee.  Dr Della Bruna stated that the applicant had a limited use of his left knee, and that he ""mobilises with crutches or a walking stick and suffers chronic pain and stiffness"".  She said this resulted in ""substantial limitations with his activities of daily living, including bathing, dressing, transferring, walking and driving"". 
70Dr Della Bruna stated that she had last reviewed the applicant on 19 March 2013 and at that time he was suffering from another infection over his left kneecap which was likely to extend into the surrounding tissue.  She described the applicant's left knee as very painful and tender to touch.  She noted the compounding effects on the applicant of the recent death of his father.  Dr Della Bruna also stated:
""If [the applicant] were in custody, without the extensive support of his mother and extended family his substantially limited mobility and general ability to self care would make it very difficult for him to cope ...
His level of impairment currently is now long standing and unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future.""
71As noted, the sentencing judge addressed this material.  His Honour found as follows:
""The offender continued in this employment until he was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident in November 2009 which led to permanent injury to his knee.  Dr Della Bruna reported that the offender required multiple surgical interventions to repair bone damage and to treat a subsequent ongoing infection.  He requires pain killing medication.
Dr Della Bruna reports that the offender suffers limited range of movement, power and mobility of his knee.  He is required to walk with crutches or a walking stick.  He reports suffering chronic pain.  The doctor reports the offender is substantially limited in undertaking any day to day activity.
The offender reports that his chronic pain affects his mood and judgment.  He suffers lower back pain and pain in his right leg from overcompensating for the injury to his knee.
...
Dr Della Bruna reports the offender is again suffering from infection to his left kneecap and may require further treatment.  He is presently living at home under the care of his mother who he relies on greatly.  Dr Della Bruna reports that the offender would have had great difficulty in custody with self-care and mobility.
These conditions will cause hardship to the offender during the serving of any period of imprisonment.  I take this hardship into account as part of the general mix of subjective circumstances.""
72Three affidavits were sought to be read on behalf of the applicant in support of this ground.  They consisted of affidavits from the applicant sworn 27 March 2014 and another sworn 27 July 2014, and an affidavit from Dr Della Bruna sworn 26 March 2014.  In its submissions the Crown indicated that it was seeking material from ""Justice Health"" in response to this material, but it had not arrived.  At the hearing of the appeal the Crown was allowed a further seven days to provide any material in response to the applicant's and Dr Della Bruna's affidavits. However the Crown subsequently advised the Court that it did not anticipate receiving material from Justice Health in sufficient time.  I note that the period between the time of service of the applicant's submissions outlining this ground together with the affidavits in support and the date of the hearing was in excess of four months.
73In his affidavit of 27 March 2014 the applicant described the difficulties he has had since his incarceration in 2013. He stated that ""for some considerable time"" after his incarceration there has been a ""hole in the skin over my patella which is open all the way to the bone"".  He said this required regular dressing, at least once daily, but it is often not dressed until every second or third day.  He said that the sore is smelly and off-putting for himself and other prisoners. 
74The applicant stated that over two months prior to swearing the affidavit, the site of this sore had become extremely painful and that the pain had radiated up to his thigh bone.  He said that even though he had suffered problems with his injury since 2009 he had not previously suffered pain in the thigh bone.  He complained that he has not ""in recent months"" undergone any tests for his bone infection, although he had requested those tests on many occasions.
75The applicant said that he attended an appointment at the Prince of Wales Hospital in May 2013 shortly after he was incarcerated.  He was prescribed an orthopaedic brace which he has worn since then. The brace is restrictive and he cannot bend his knee.  He described the difficulties he faces in wearing a brace in prison, including sharing a cell of small size in circumstances where he is required to keep his leg straight.  The applicant stated that he is often placed in a cell in locations that require him to walk up and down stairs.  He complained that prison staff do not take this into account and instead refer to outdated medical material indicating that he is capable of moving.  
76The applicant stated that a doctor had requested he be specially transported to medical examinations but that did not occur.  He said he cannot work, play sports or do any ""cardio training"".  Most of his days are spent doing ""more or less nothing"".
77The applicant said that, despite finishing a course of antibiotics in January 2014, he still suffers ongoing fevers, soreness in the area and discharge from the knee.  He also stated that he cannot obtain proper pain relief.  The applicant stated that the ""brace is dragging me down mentally and emotionally"".  He said that he has found this time in custody much more difficult than previous occasions when he has been incarcerated as a result of his injury, the lack of medical care and treatment, and the lack of change in his conditions to accommodate his injury.
78In her affidavit sworn 26 March 2014 Dr Della Bruna recounted attending the applicant on 27 January 2014.  She had access to notes from the Royal North Shore Hospital as well as the applicant's Justice Health file.  Dr Della Bruna noted that on 14 August 2013 a registrar had indicated that the applicant would need further surgery, but nothing further had happened.  She said that the notes did not disclose any reason why that surgery had not taken place.
79On examination of the applicant, Dr Della Bruna observed the open wound to his left knee described above. She considered that the knee had deteriorated since she last examined the applicant. Dr Della Bruna stated that the applicant requires ""surgeries to treat the infected area of skin and open wound and remove tethered skin that profoundly limits [the applicant's] range of movement"".  She also stated that the applicant needs follow up with regular and intensive physiotherapy.  Dr Della Bruna expressed scepticism as to whether the applicant will receive the appropriate medical attention he needs, and fears ""he will be left with a permanently disabled left leg"".  Dr Della Bruna also stated:
""There is also the very real possibility that the infection if not adequately treated may spread into the joint and underlying bone, causing septic arthritis and osteomyelitis respectively, that would be a medical disaster and would be very difficulty to treat.""
80In his affidavit sworn 22 July 2014, the applicant explained that ""[a]bout 2-3 months ago"" the brace on his leg was removed.  He said the open sore then healed over and ""[o]verall it is much better"".  He said that he still had restricted movement but he can climb stairs and interact with other inmates without embarrassment.  Nevertheless, he stated that he still has strong pain in the bone and continues to suffer significant pain in his knee area radiating in the bone towards his ankle.  He also stated that the range of movement in his left leg is still restricted.  He added that when he last saw a doctor he was told he would need physiotherapy when the brace was removed, but that has not occurred.
81The criteria for the admission of such evidence is not entirely clear. In R v Ashton [2002] NSWCCA 498; 137 A Crim R 73 at 76 Howie J stated that the Court receives evidence concerning events subsequent to sentencing which concern ""the physical or mental condition of the applicant where the existence or effect of that condition was unknown or not fully appreciated at the time sentence was passed"".  However his Honour also noted (at 77) that the admission of such material was conditioned by the need for the circumstances to be ""special and unusual"" (citing R v Ehrenburgh (Supreme Court (NSW), 14 December 1990, unrep);  see also R v Kertebani; Kertebani v R [2010] NSWCCA 221 at [37] to [39]). 
82In Iglesias at [12] such evidence was admitted without the Court specifically adverting to whether it was ""special"" or ""unusual"".  McClellan CJ at CL dealt with the material as follows:
""[12]   I am satisfied in the present case that the circumstances justify this Court in receiving the fresh evidence. Although the applicant had complained of symptoms which were clearly related to his carcinoma, his condition had not been diagnosed at the time of sentence. It was only a matter of weeks before the correct diagnosis was made which revealed a significantly adverse medical situation. However, whether, having regard to the facts which are now known, this Court should intervene raises different considerations.
[13]   Critical to that question is whether or not, by reason of the medical condition of the applicant as it is now understood, his period of incarceration will be more onerous than was appreciated when he was sentenced, justifying any reduction in his non-parole period. This requires consideration of his physical condition, the availability of medical facilities and whether he can be adequately treated within the prison system.""  (emphasis added)
83Having posed this test, McClellan CJ at CL held that the material did not justify a reduction in sentence (at [15]).
84The material concerning the applicant's time in custody can conveniently be addressed in four related components.
85First there are the difficulties he has experienced as a result of his impaired movement.  I do not consider that this is any different to what was envisaged by the sentencing judge.  The applicant was using crutches when he was sentenced.  The sentencing judge was clearly cognisant that his knee condition was longstanding and specifically adverted to the difficulties in ""mobility"" he would face while in custody.
86The second concerns the applicant's open wound to his knee. The overall effect of the material is that for a sustained, but now closed, period the applicant suffered from an open wound to his knee which was painful and caused various difficulties.  I have no doubt that this was distressing. However, again in light of the material that was presented to the sentencing judge, it was a foreseeable consequence of the condition he was known to be suffering at the time he was sentenced. The sentencing judge specifically noted that the applicant had suffered from persistent infection.
87The third is the possibility that he has developed a bone infection. The difficulty with that is that at the moment it remains only a possibility, albeit the concern is genuine. 
88The fourth concerns the generally poor level of medical treatment received by the applicant in custody as disclosed by the affidavits.  The material suggests he needed some form of surgery on his knee but has not received it.  He was not supplied with appropriate dressing when his wound was open, and has had difficulty in obtaining painkillers.  As noted, Justice Health has had more than sufficient time to respond to the evidence of these complaints but it did not respond.  As I have noted, there is the possibility that, unless he is properly treated, he may develop a bone infection.  There are strong reasons to doubt that in the time remaining on his sentence the authorities will take the appropriate action to prevent that occurring.
89If the evidence was confined to the first three matters just noted, I would reject it.  All of the unfortunate medical conditions and physical limitations that have affected the applicant were in contemplation at the time of his sentencing.  However, the inadequacy of his medical treatment in custody is not so straightforward.  This is not a category of case where the sentencing judge received some assurance that the applicant would receive a particular level of treatment which was then not forthcoming (cf R v Keir supra).  Further, the sentencing judge noted that the applicant had been receiving a high level of support from Dr Della Bruna and his mother, with the implication being that he would not receive that same level in custody.  Nevertheless the sentencing judge was entitled to assume, and most likely did assume, that a reasonable level of medical support would be made available to the applicant while incarcerated, yet the evidence is to the contrary. 
90I consider that the threshold for the admission of this material has been met. The poor standard of medical treatment that the applicant has received has had the consequence that the various sequelae of the applicant's condition that were contemplated by the sentencing judge have had a more oppressive effect than was contemplated.  It is one matter to envisage a prisoner having an ongoing infected knee. It is another to envisage the prisoner not getting a reasonable level of pain relief and wound dressing, much less not having any necessary surgery.
91Nevertheless there remains the issue whether this material renders the applicant's ""period of incarceration ... more onerous than was appreciated when he was sentenced [so as to] justify any reduction of the applicant's non-parole period"" (Iglesias at [13]).  In my view it does not.  The sentencing judge was presented with a significant amount of material concerning the applicant's condition and clearly gave it great weight.  The sentence imposed on the applicant was at the low end of the range, given the seriousness of his conduct and his otherwise extremely poor subjective case.  The concerns raised by the evidence before the Court do not warrant any reduction in the sentence that was imposed.
92I consider that no basis for intervention by this Court has been established, but, even if there was, no lesser sentence is warranted in law (Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3)).
Disposition
93Accordingly, the orders I propose are:
(1)Leave to appeal granted;
(2)Appeal dismissed.
94HAMILL J:  I agree with Beech-Jones J.
95I would only add that I find it most unsatisfactory that Justice Health has failed to provide evidence concerning its medical treatment of the applicant, and the uncontested assertion that it has failed to provide timely and appropriate treatment.  
96The authorities are now on notice of the opinion and concern of the applicant's doctor that the failure properly to treat his condition may result in permanent disability.

5The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 25% for the plea of guilty.
6The applicant, by notice of application for leave to appeal filed on 23 June 2014, proposed the following grounds of appeal:
(1)His Honour erred in his assessment of the seriousness of the offending conduct.
(2)His Honour erred in failing to have proper regard to the totality principle in his accumulation of the sentences.
(3)His Honour erred in limiting his consideration of special circumstances to the question of whether or not the applicant required a longer period of supervision.
(4)The overall sentence was manifestly excessive.
7At the hearing of the application, the third ground was no longer pressed.
Facts
8Jui Wei Huang, who was both a drug dealer and a drug addict, owed the applicant $500 for drugs. He was avoiding the applicant, who was trying to recover the debt. Erin Cincotta, who owed Huang money, told the applicant that Huang would be visiting her on 6 August 2011 for the purpose of collecting at least part of the debt. The applicant, who was angry that Huang had not paid him, told Cincotta that he was going to ""slap him over the head"" when he saw him.
9That afternoon the applicant asked two friends, Aydin Taycan Dogan and Hassan Saleh (the deceased), to accompany him to Cincotta's home. 
10Later that afternoon, Huang telephoned the applicant and told him that he would be in a position to repay some of the money he owed, because he expected to be paid (by Cincotta). When Huang arrived at Cincotta's house, carrying drugs and scales, she led him into the lounge room. Shortly afterwards the deceased and, later, Dogan arrived. When the applicant arrived he went into the lounge room. At this point, the deceased grabbed Huang by the feet and Dogan held him around his neck. The applicant asked Huang if he had the money. Huang replied that he did not. 
11The applicant started to hit Huang on his face with both hands. He then pulled a pouch out of his pocket and used it to hit Huang, who sustained a large bruise and significant swelling to his head and face.
12The applicant subsequently retrieved a pistol from the pouch and pointed it in the direction of Huang's legs. He ordered Huang to get up from floor, where he was lying. Dogan released his grip on Huang's neck. The deceased helped Huang up. The applicant walked behind Huang, who was facing the deceased. The applicant was still holding the gun.
13Without the applicant expecting it to do so, the gun discharged. It was no more than two feet from the deceased's face. The bullet passed through the deceased's left cheek and lodged in his brain. He died in hospital the following day, having been maintained on a ventilator in the interim.
14The applicant left the scene with the gun, which has not been recovered.
The Remarks on Sentence
Findings of objective seriousness of the offences
15His Honour recorded that the agreed basis for the entry of the plea of guilty to manslaughter was an unlawful and dangerous act: brandishing a firearm in a dangerous and threatening manner at close range, causing death. The sentencing judge noted accordingly that the applicant was not to be sentenced on the basis that he intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm. 
16The sentencing judge was not satisfied to the requisite standard either that the applicant knew either that the gun was loaded, or believed that it was not.
17His Honour described the manslaughter as ""undoubtedly a very serious example of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act"" although not in the ""worst category"". The sentencing judge said further, in assessing the objective seriousness of manslaughter, at [30]:""In this case, the offender recruited two associates, including the deceased, to help him severely beat someone to recover a drug debt. While doing so he brandished a pistol to induce the victim of the beating to believe he would or might be shot. If it is sensible to speak of a range of manslaughters, then this offence is at the high end of the range.""
18His Honour also considered that the assault on Huang was at the upper end of the range of seriousness since it was planned, undertaken for the purpose of recovering a drug debt and involved substantial bruising and the infliction of significant pain. The sentencing judge considered the firearms offence was in the higher range of objective seriousness but imposed a ""heavily reduced"" sentence to avoid the offender being ""doubly punished"".
19His Honour addressed the applicant's subjective circumstances, including his drug use from the age of 14 and his recent fatherhood. He had a limited criminal record. His Honour considered that he had good prospects of rehabilitation.
20The sentencing judge addressed what his Honour described as the ""significant potential for overlap between the facts and circumstances surrounding each of the three offences"". His Honour referred to Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at [40]- [49] where the High Court said that it is appropriate to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then proceed to consider questions of totality, cumulation and concurrence, while taking care not to subject the offender to double punishment.
21His Honour's reasons for the structure of the sentences appears from [61] of the remarks on sentence:""I consider that the sentences for the manslaughter offence and the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence should be partially accumulated. They were logically distinct crimes with no overlapping elements. There were separate victims. However they arose out of the one criminal escapade and occurred within minutes of each other.""
22The sentencing judge adjusted the sentence to maintain the statutory ratio in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
Reasons
23There are three grounds of appeal and substantial overlap between them. I propose to address the first two grounds separately although there is some artificiality in dividing them in this way since the principal gravamen of the applicant's complaint is that the sentence was manifestly excessive by reason of the sentencing judge's assessment of the objective seriousness of the manslaughter. 
Ground 1: alleged error in assessment of objective seriousness of offending conduct
24The plea involved an acceptance of the following elements of involuntary manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act: 
(1)the intentional commission of an act contrary to the criminal law that carries an appreciable risk of serious injury (brandishing a firearm in close range of others) and which caused the death of the deceased; and
(2)a reasonable person in the position of the applicant, performing the act that he performed (brandishing a firearm in close range of others) would have realised that he or she was exposing another and others to an appreciable risk.
25The applicant submitted that the first sentence in the passage from [30] of the remarks on sentence set out above showed that the sentencing judge took into account the severe beating inflicted on Huang (which was the subject of the second count) in assessing the objective seriousness of the manslaughter and therefore double-counted the assault. 
26I do not accept this submission. His Honour was entitled to take into account the circumstance that the accidental shooting occurred in circumstances where the purpose of the encounter between the applicant and Huang was to threaten Huang with physical violence and, indeed, to inflict it, with a view to making him repay the debt to the applicant. The applicant carried the gun to threaten Huang. It was brandished in the course of a physical assault on Huang which was carried out by the applicant, the deceased and Dogan. The physical assault was the subject of the second count but it also formed part of the background against which the seriousness of the manslaughter is to be adjudged.
27I do not discern in his Honour's reasons any elision of the distinction between the first and second counts or any reason to conclude that the assault was double-counted in the sentences for the first and second counts.
28Although the applicant accepted that the surrounding circumstances were unquestionably serious, he contended that the objective seriousness of the manslaughter was significantly reduced by the following:
(a)The discharge of the weapon was accidental.
(b)The Crown was not able to establish that the applicant knew that the pistol was loaded.
(c)The applicant did not wish the deceased any harm.
29I consider that factor (a) can be put to one side since the offence to which the applicant pleaded was involuntary manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, which would have been inapplicable if the applicant had discharged the gun deliberately. Factor (c) is not to the point. One of the dangers of brandishing a gun is that it can discharge and injure or kill those in the vicinity, whether or not the holder of the gun bears the victim any ill-will. 
30As to factor (b), the applicant submitted as follows:""The criminality involved in brandishing a pistol in circumstances where it was not established that the applicant knew it was loaded was significantly less than the criminality involved in deliberately taking a weapon to a confrontation with the intent of using it and actually using it.""
31I do not accept that the distinction between the two scenarios postulated is as clear as the applicant contended. The applicant deliberately took a weapon (the gun) to a confrontation with the intention of using it (to threaten harm) and, while using it for the purpose for which he had brought it to the scene, he accidentally used it for another purpose (to kill his friend). In my view, the significance of factor (b) is diminished by the circumstance that his Honour was not satisfied that the applicant did not know that the gun was loaded. In other words, his Honour sentenced the applicant on the basis that the applicant's state of mind (whether ignorance, belief or knowledge) whether the pistol was loaded had not been established. 
32For someone to brandish a gun at close range of others in those circumstances is fraught with danger. If a gun discharges, with or without warning, the risk, which ensued in the present case, of someone being killed or seriously wounded is substantial. Other weapons, including implements such as knives which are commonly available for other purposes, or fists, may be used with fatal consequences. In such circumstances, those who use them may be guilty of involuntary manslaughter, where there is neither an intention to harm nor to kill. However, neither the wielding of a knife nor the shaking of a fist is as fraught with risk to human life and limb as the brandishing of a gun. Nor do other weapons tend to be as effective at inducing fear and compliance as a gun.
33The maximum penalty of 25 years is a relevant guidepost: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27]. The sentencing judge adopted a starting point of 14 years and 8 months for manslaughter, before discounting the sentence by 25% to take account of the plea of guilty.
34I do not discern any basis for concluding that his Honour erred in assessing the manslaughter committed by the applicant as serious example of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. 
35In these circumstances I am not persuaded that his Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the manslaughter was erroneous, or that the sentence imposed for that offence was excessive.
Ground 2: alleged failure to have regard to totality principle in accumulation of sentences
36Because of the way his Honour structured the sentence, the effect of the sentences imposed for the second count was to extend the non-parole period by a year from an expiry on 14 August 2018 (the expiry of the non-parole period for manslaughter) to 14 August 2019 (the expiry of the fixed term for assault occasioning actual bodily harm). The sentence imposed for the third count was wholly concurrent and fell within the non-parole period for manslaughter and therefore did not require the applicant to serve any additional time.
37Counts one and two involved different victims and had no overlapping elements, although they occurred in the course of the same offending conduct. It was therefore, in my view, appropriate that there be a degree of accumulation. The decision whether to accumulate sentences or to make them concurrent is one which is pre-eminently a matter of discretion for the sentencing judge: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]-[28] per Howie J. His Honour correctly identified the relevant principles. I am not persuaded that there was any error in his approach.
Ground 4: whether the overall sentence was manifestly excessive
38The applicant cited instances where the sentences imposed for manslaughter offences were shorter, in some cases significantly so, than the sentence imposed on him in the present case. It is well recognised that, of all offences, manslaughter produces the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability. Consequently there is a substantial range in the sentences imposed for this offence: R v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67 (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ). For this reason, statistical analysis of sentences imposed for manslaughter is not helpful. Nor is citation of other instances said to be comparable a proper approach: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54]-[55]. 
39Manslaughter may be voluntary (because the mental element for murder has been established) or involuntary (because it has not been). Involuntary manslaughter may be committed by unlawful and dangerous act or by criminal negligence. For a detailed discussion of how unlawful homicide is divided into two mutually exclusive categories: murder, with the balance amounting to manslaughter see: Lane v R [2013] NSWCCA 317 at [44]-[65] per Bathurst CJ, Simpson and Adamson JJ. Comparisons between cases where the manslaughter includes the mental element for murder (but is not murder because there is provocation, excessive self-defence or substantial impairment) and those in which, as in the present case, it does not, tend not to be fruitful. 
40Further, the cases referred to by the applicant include convictions for manslaughter after trial. A jury is not required to specify on what basis a verdict of guilty of manslaughter is returned. It is unnecessary that the jurors be unanimous as to the type of manslaughter of which they are satisfied the offender is guilty: R v Cramp [1999] NSWCCA 324; 110 A Crim R 198; R v Dally [2000] NSWCCA 162; 115 A Crim R 582. It is generally inadvisable for a trial judge to question the jury as to the basis of a verdict of manslaughter, it being a matter for the sentencing judge to find the relevant facts consistently with the jury's verdict: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. 
41A search for ""comparable"" cases can serve to do no more than highlight the variety of circumstances in which manslaughter is committed. For these reasons this Court has found that sentencing statistics for manslaughter offences are of such limited assistance to sentencing judges that they should be avoided: R v Wood [2014] NSWCCA 184 at [55]- [59] per Price, Garling and Bellew JJ.
42For the reasons given above, I am not persuaded that there has been any error in his Honour's approach, either in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences or in the structure of the sentence. The fourth ground is a conclusion which requires error to be shown in the result, even if an error cannot be identified in the process: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6] per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J. As referred to above, the sentence for the second count added one year to the period that the applicant is to spend in custody; the sentence for the third count had no practical effect. I am not persuaded that the sentence is manifestly excessive or that the principle of totality has not been correctly applied.
Proposed orders
43The orders I propose are:
(3)Leave to appeal granted.
(4)Appeal dismissed.

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Adamson J

2FULLERTON J: I agree with Adamson J.

3ADAMSON J: The Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) appeals pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the sentence imposed on the respondent on 28 March 2014 by Flannery DCJ on the single ground of manifest inadequacy.

4An aggregate sentence was imposed of 5 years and 6 months to commence on 17 January 2011 with a non-parole period of 3 years and 10 months for 19 offences of child sexual offending involving 4 victims (TW, SM, LM and ET) aged between 8 and 12 and on at least 9 separate occasions. The respondent was convicted after trial by jury of some of the charges; in respect of others he pleaded guilty, as shown in the table below.

5On 17 July 2013 the respondent stood trial on an indictment (the trial indictment). He pleaded guilty to count 8 (aggravated indecent assault on a person under the age of sixteen years), but not guilty to the remaining counts. On 31 July 2013 the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all but one of the remaining counts. One of the original counts, 13, was the subject of a verdict by direction, but was replaced by consent by a further count, 13A.

6A second indictment was presented on 4 November 2013 (the plea indictment) to which the respondent entered pleas of guilty to three further charges of aggravated indecent assault on a person under sixteen years (s 61M of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)). These offences were committed between 1 January 2003 and 31 March 2003. The standard non-parole period came into effect on 1 February 2003 but, as the sentencing judge was not satisfied that the offences were committed after that date, her Honour did not have regard to it. The respondent asked that a Form 1 offence of aggravated indecency be taken into account in the sentence for the third count on the indictment.

7Pursuant to s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), the sentencing judge indicated the sentences that would have been imposed but for the imposition of an aggregate sentence. The indicative sentences for each count are set out in the following table.

Facts
9The sentencing judge made findings of fact for the offences in the trial indictment based on the evidence at trial and summarised the agreed facts in respect of the charges on the plea indictment. These facts are set out below.

Victim ET: the plea indictment

Count 1 on plea indictment (aggravated sexual assault)

10ET is the respondent's niece. The respondent, who lived with his parents in a house at Yass, had a caravan on ""Chilton"", a rural family property 15 kms out of Yass. Between 1 January 2003 and 31 March 2003 the respondent took ET, who was then ten, to the caravan. He asked her what she knew about sex and whether she had had sex before. ET felt uncomfortable but trusted her uncle and told him that she did not know much. 

11The respondent drove ET back to his parents' house and took her to his bedroom. No one else was at home. He asked her to remove her clothes, which she did with his help. He led her to the bed and laid her down on her back. He began touching and kissing her outer vagina. He told her: ""This would be easier if you spread your legs."" When he had finished he said to her, ""You're special. You shouldn't tell anyone about this. I could get into trouble.""

Count 2 on plea indictment (aggravated sexual assault)

12A couple of days later the respondent collected ET from school and took her to ""Chilton"" to feed the horses. He took her to the stables as it was raining. ET was wearing a skirt, as he had asked her to do to make it easier for him to touch her. He asked her to remove her skirt and underwear. He pulled his pants down and asked her to sit on his lap. She was facing him. She saw his penis, which was erect and circumcised. He kissed her and stuck his tongue in her mouth. He rubbed his penis on the outside of her vagina by lifting her up and down.

Count 3 on plea indictment (aggravated indecent assault) and Form 1 (act of indecency)

13On another occasion in the three-month period, the respondent took ET to the riverbank at ""Chilton"". He touched and kissed her outer vagina. He asked her to rub his penis. ET put her hand around his penis and rubbed up and down. He said, ""you need more practice"" and ""do it hard or faster"". After a while the respondent walked away and ejaculated.

Complaint by ET and subsequent report to police

14ET said that incidents of the nature of the conduct the subject of these three counts occurred regularly over the three-month period. He would generally say to her, ""It's our secret"" and ""don't tell anyone or I will get into trouble"". At the end of the three-month period, before ET and her family moved to the Northern Territory, the respondent gave her a gold cross with gem stones in it.

15In 2009 ET confided in school friend about the respondent's conduct. This was the first time she had disclosed what had occurred. In the school holidays in July 2010 ET and her sisters were visiting their grandparents at the respondent's house. ET was on the computer looking for photographs of her horse when she opened a folder called ""[respondent's] photos"" and saw numerous photos of naked children. She recognised one girl as TW, the then 12-year old daughter of the respondent's girlfriend, WW. She became distressed and spoke to her uncle about it. She was encouraged to report the matter to police. She made her first statement to police on 28 August 2010.

Trial indictment

16The respondent was arrested on 17 January 2011. The police executed a search warrant and seized a computer, an SD card and hardcopy photographs. Three girls were identified: TW (who was then 14) and two sisters, LM (then aged 11) and SM (then aged 12) who were family friends of the respondent. Although TW is not the respondent's natural daughter, he has known her since birth and refers to her as his daughter and she to him as her father. TW refused to co-operate with police. LM and SM were first interviewed on 19 January 2011.

17The search of the computer resulted in an unknown number of images containing child abuse material and printed photographs depicting TW, LM and SM in pornographic poses. The respondent's car was searched. A camera located in the car contained child abuse images on the card. Police also seized a purple exercise book that contained cut-outs from magazines of children in swimming costumes.

18The respondent was convicted of possession of child abuse material (count 1 on the trial indictment). He was also convicted of the following counts (2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 14) of using a child for pornographic purposes. These counts arose from the photographs described in the table below which were obtained as a result of the search warrant referred to above. Count 8, aggravated indecent assault of SM, arose from a photograph and is also referred to in the table below.

Count 12: aggravated indecent assault of SM

19On 26 June 2010 a party was held to celebrate TW's birthday at WW's home Rye Park. During the course of the party, TW, SM and LM were all nude. At one point the respondent came up behind SM, who was seated, and touched her breast.

Count 13A: aggravated indecent assault of LM

20At the same party, the respondent touched the vagina of LM, who was then ten. She was naked at the time.

Count 16: aggravated indecent assault of SM

21During the school holidays in the latter part of 2010, near a dam on his girlfriend's property, the respondent attempted to force his penis into SM's mouth. She resisted but did place her tongue on his penis. She was ten years old.

Count 17: aggravated indecent assault of SM

22At around Christmas 2010, the respondent took SM, aged 10, to his caravan at ""Chilton"". She was sitting on the bed and he lay on top of her. He was trying to unzip his pants. He said to her, ""I want to fuck you so bad, I don't care what you say or if you scream nobody can hear you."" She started screaming for her mother and the respondent stopped.

The sentence hearing

23The Crown tendered the agreed facts relevant to the plea indictment, the respondent's criminal and custodial history, victim impact statements of SM and ET and the remarks on sentence of WW. WW had been sentenced for having care of a child under the age of fourteen and allowing the child to be used for the production of pornographic material.

24SM said in her victim impact statement that she does not trust many people anymore and that she ""learnt stuff she shouldn't have known as a kid"" and that ""he has ruined my life"". ET said in her victim impact statement that she was diagnosed with severe depression and has attempted suicide several times. She suffers from flashbacks and panic attacks. She finds it extremely difficult to be intimate with a man and cannot cope with intimacy. She also finds it hard to cope with change. Neither TW nor LM provided victim impact statements.

25The respondent tendered the report of Dr Seidler, psychologist. The respondent gave oral evidence solely concerning the issue of protective custody.

The remarks on sentence

26Her Honour outlined the facts and referred to the victim impact statements and the use that can be made of them. Her Honour found that the evidence did not permit a finding that the emotional harm caused by the offences was substantial. In respect of the offences under s 61M (aggravated indecent assaults) she considered that they were ""not much more than momentary touchings, three were committed without any force or coercion, and without the use of threats or pressure."" 

27In respect of the counts on the plea indictment her Honour found that they were objectively serious examples of aggravated sexual assault. However she accepted that sentencing patterns had moved adversely since the time of their commission and that the respondent ought to be sentenced in accordance with previous patterns.

28Her Honour was satisfied that the offences were aggravated as the respondent abused his position of trust. However, her Honour rejected each the following aggravating features relied on by the Crown:

(1)The injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offences is substantial in respect of SM and ET;

(2)The victims were vulnerable because they were very young;

(3)The offences involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts; and

(4)The offences were part of a planned or organised criminal activity.

29Her Honour found, in respect of all offences, that the evidence did not permit her to find that the emotional harm caused by the offences was substantial. Her Honour referred to the principles for taking into account victim impact statements set out in R v Slack [2004] NSWCCA 128 by Sperling J at [58]-[62], Simpson J agreeing.

30The sentencing judge summarised the respondent's subjective circumstances in substantial detail and relied on the report of Dr Seidler, psychologist and the respondent's evidence at the sentence hearing. Her Honour made the following findings about his subjective circumstances. 

31The respondent was born on 10 November 1971 and was 42 when sentenced. He had no criminal record. He grew up on a family farm in a financially stable environment with both parents and three older siblings. He said that although he was shown kindness and appropriate care by his parents he was the subject of emotional abuse at the hands of his siblings and as a result he was an isolated and unhappy child who spent much of his time alone. He was bullied throughout his school years but in secondary school he had friends and was reasonably comfortable socially during those years. His academic performance was average. He completed Year 11.

32He has helped his father on the family property or worked odd jobs, involving farm labouring and maintenance. For two years before being incarcerated he worked as a packer at Bunnings Trade Centre in Canberra. He has continued to live with his parents despite being in a long term relationship as it was convenient and close to his work. He was financially independent. He has not abused substances.

33He had no contact with his siblings at the time of the interview. He still enjoyed the support of his mother and spoke to his father occasionally. He reported to Dr Seidler that upon his release he intended to work for his father-in-law on his rural property.

34He had little sexual contact with anyone until his relationship with WW in his thirties. He reported that she has been his only sexual partner. He identified as a heterosexual and described to Dr Seidler being maximally attracted to young adult women and peer aged women but he also endorsed sexual attraction across the lifespan from moderate interests in both pre and post-pubertal female children to older adult women. Dr Seidler thought this was of concern. Dr Seidler noted that the respondent's understanding of what constituted child sexual abuse was unsophisticated as was his insight into possible victim impact. The respondent alleged that he and his wife had actively practised nudism in the family home and had done so for years. He denied that it was sexually motivated.

35Dr Seidler found the respondent's account of his offending behaviour was generally distorted, irresponsible and implausible such that he minimised his behaviour, blamed his victims and denied any sexual intent.

36Dr Seidler assessed the respondent's mental health and personality and found that because of the considerable and deliberate distortion his profile could not be interpreted as a realistic representation of his functioning or symptom experience. Dr Seidler concluded:
""it is my opinion that [the respondent's] sexual offending behaviour probably represents the culmination of a long-standing pattern of deviant sexual interests coupled with poor self-esteem, limited relationship experience, poor emotional coping skills and social awkwardness and anxiety which has prevented him from exploring other relationships.""

37Dr Seidler considered the respondent to be at moderate risk of re-offending by reason of his age-inappropriate and deviant sexual interests, in addition to his problematic thought patterns and affective/social concerns. In her view treatment would be a challenging process but that he would profit from treatment if he were willing to engage and participate and this would improve his prognosis through the development of insight and appropriate risk management strategies.

38Her Honour accepted the respondent's evidence that he has been, and will remain, in a form of protective custody until he is released to parole and as a result his movement has been and will be restricted.

39The sentencing judge set out the indicative sentences in accordance with the requirements of 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

40Her Honour, having announced in the remarks on sentence the indicative sentences that would have been imposed, said as follows before pronouncing the aggregate sentence:
""Madam Crown submitted that there must be at least some partial accumulation to reflect the totality of the criminality in these matters.
I agree. I intend to impose an aggregate sentence and will reflect in that sentence a measure of accumulation to reflect the fact that there was [sic] separate victims and separate occasions.""

41Her Honour did not, however, explain the aggregate sentence in light of the indicative sentences and in particular did not explain why she thought such a substantial degree of implicit concurrence was appropriate having regard to the range of offences, the time period over which they occurred and the number of victims.

42Her Honour found special circumstances and adjusted the statutory ratio accordingly from 75% to approximately 70%.

Reasons

The relevant principles

43A claim of manifest inadequacy requires the Crown to establish that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust, having regard to the principles that there is no single ""correct"" sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach: Dinsdale v R (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]; Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538 [58]. 

44Whether a sentence is manifestly inadequate is a conclusion. It is not necessary to identify any particular error in the process; it is the examination of the result that leads to the conclusion. Nonetheless it can be helpful to ascertain why and how the sentence was arrived at since this inquiry may explain the conclusion and expose the reason for any manifest inadequacy.

Whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate

45The respondent's crimes warranted substantial punishment and unconditional denunciation. He abused the trust that the young girls reposed in him. He not only corrupted them for his own sexual gratification but he also used their bodies to create permanent records by photographing them in sexualised poses. He committed a total of 19 offences involving 4 victims aged between 8 and 12 and on at least 9 occasions in circumstances where her Honour found that he had no remorse and his prospects of rehabilitation were not good.

46As the Crown does not contend that the indicative sentences were inadequate, the assessment by the sentencing judge of the objective seriousness of each of the offences does not arise for review. The circumstances in which such review would be undertaken are, in any event, limited: see the authorities referred to in Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116 at [46]-[47] per Fullerton J, Ward JA agreeing. At least some of the sentences indicated, in particular those for which the standard non-parole period applied and for which the respondent was convicted at trial, were, in my view, outside the lower end of the range, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offences, unmitigated by any relevant circumstances pertaining to the respondent. However, I consider myself to be obliged to accept that each of the indicative sentences was within the appropriate range because the Crown did not wish to be heard to the contrary. 

47Nor is there, in these circumstances, any need to review her Honour's assessment of the difference in sentencing patterns for such offences between the time of the offending and the time at which the sentence was imposed since such difference is accommodated in the indicative sentences.

48As referred to above, her Honour did not consider the evidence to permit the inference that the victims suffered substantial emotional harm. The correctness of this finding, by reason of the limited challenge made by the Crown, does not arise for review. However, before addressing the substantive challenge, I propose to make some observations about this finding, since it tends to imply, contrary to the fact, that these offences were not particularly serious.

The finding regarding the harm to the victims: the relevance of victim impact statements

49It is of the nature of the offences of which the respondent was convicted that the victims suffer emotional harm and in many, if not most, cases the harm may fairly be described as substantial. The damage done to children who are the victims of sexual assault and other sexual abuse by adults is well known and can be assumed. The maximum sentences imposed by Parliament, and, more recently, the stipulation of standard non-parole periods, are indications of the seriousness of the offences, adjudged by the harm they generally, if not inevitably, cause. Her Honour's finding was, however, made in the context of s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which provides that it is an aggravating factor if the victim, relevantly, suffers substantial emotional harm. This provision is of general application in that it applies to sentencing generally and not merely to sentencing offenders who have committed sex offences against children.

50The victim impact statements of SM and ET comprised relevant evidence of the harm to them. Although there are, as Sperling J said in R v Slack, limits to the use to which victim impact statements can be put, it is important to have regard to the content and purpose of the relevant statutory provisions. Section 30A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 permits a victim to read, or to have read out by another, a victim impact statement. The section does not appear to contemplate that the author of the statement will be cross-examined. A sentencing judge is entitled to receive and consider victim impact statements (as her Honour did in the instant case) under s 28(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Such statements have been described by this Court as ""a particular species of evidence available to a sentencing judge"": R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [25] per Simpson J, Latham J agreeing.

51Section 29(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (which is relevant in the cases of TW and LM) provides that the absence of a victim impact statement does not give rise to an inference that an offence had little or no impact on a victim. 

52One of the purposes of such statements is to inform the sentencing judge of the harm suffered by the victim and, accordingly, whether it amounts to substantial emotional harm within the meaning of s 21A(2)(g) of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. As Hunt CJ at CL said in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76: 
In cases where the victim is still alive - that is, the victim directly injured by the offender's criminal act - victim impact statements will no doubt serve the useful purpose in the criminal courts of establishing the consequences of the crime upon that victim.

53The victims' statements were tendered without objection. No argument was addressed to what weight ought to be attributed to them. Their contents were closely in accordance with the expected consequences of conduct such as the respondent's. It is difficult to understand why her Honour was not prepared to infer, on the basis of the statements, that the victims suffered substantial emotional harm as a result of the offending conduct. 

The substantive challenge: inadequate accumulation

54As referred to above, the Crown confined its challenge to the sentence to what it submitted was a wholly inadequate degree of accumulation of the indicative sentences. The Crown contended that although the degree of accumulation is generally discretionary, the level of implicit concurrence led to there being no effective punishment for much of the offending conduct.

55Her Honour was entitled to impose an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 rather than imposing a separate sentence in respect of each offence under s 53 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The benefit of an aggregate sentence in the present case is that it obviates the need to specify commencement and expiry dates for each sentence, while maintaining transparency by indicating the sentences that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed: R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219 at [55] - [60] per RA Hulme J. The difference between imposing multiple sentences for offending conduct rather than an aggregate sentence is, in substance, procedural. 

56In the second reading speech for the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Bill 2010 (which inserted what became s 53A), the Honourable Michael Veitch on behalf of the then Attorney General stated:
""The reasons for setting out the precise details of each sentence are to ensure transparency, reflect criminality and ensure that victims get due recognition. This also makes it easier to adjust an overall sentence when one sentence is changed on appeal. Those principles remain important, but in order to simplify the sentencing process for the judiciary, and for the community's understanding of it, the Government has decided to remove the requirement to specify the precise detail of any overlap between the sentences by allowing it to set one overall sentence and one non-parole period, provided that the court first indicates the appropriate sentence that would have been given for each offence had it been sentenced individually. The amendments will allow the judge to approach sentencing for multiple offences in a simple way when appropriate and lead to a sentence which is simpler and more easily understood by all."" (New South Wales Legislative Council, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 23 November 2010 at 27867)

57Section 53A of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was inserted to avoid the somewhat involved process required for sentencing for multiple offending referred to in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at [43] - [49] per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ. Unless s 53A is used and an aggregate sentence imposed, commencement and expiry dates that are without practical effect are required to be specified for each offence. 

58The imposition of an aggregate sentence is, however, not to be used to minimise the offending conduct, or obscure or obliterate the range of offending conduct or its totality. This is, in my view, what has occurred here. In R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 at [36]-[37] (approved in R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130; 171 A Crim R 267 at [46]) Sully J said:
""...[There] is the need to ensure public confidence in the administration of criminal justice; and, in particular, to ensure that there does not emerge in the community at large a perception that there is not all that much to choose between the person who commits one or two offences, and the person who commits six or seven offences, for the reason that somehow or other they all manage to finish up with effective sentences between or among which there is hardly anything in practical terms to choose.""

59The large measure of implied concurrence between the indicative sentences that is implicit in the aggregate sentence imposed fails, in my view, to acknowledge the separate harm done to each child by the respondent's different criminal acts and the separate harm done to each of the children: see Carlton v R [2014] NSWCCA 14 at [87]-[89] per R A Hulme J, citing Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 and R v Gorman [2002] NSWCCA 516; 137 A Crim R 326.

60The imposition of an aggregate sentence relieved the sentencing judge of specifying commencement dates and expiry dates for all offences and thereby spared her Honour the task of setting out the extent to which there was concurrence between sentences for different offences against different victims and well as between similar offences against the same victims. It did not, however, relieve her Honour of imposing a sentence that was proportional to the totality of the offending conduct. 

61I accept the Crown's submission that the sentencing judge has imposed a sentence that was manifestly inadequate by reason of the degree of concurrence implicit in the aggregate sentence when compared with the indicative sentences. In my view, the aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate to reflect the totality of the offending conduct having regard to its objective seriousness.

Residual discretion 

62This Court retains a residual discretion in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act to refuse to interfere in a sentence, even if error has been demonstrated and manifest inadequacy established: Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293; Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462. 

63This Court is obliged to consider the exercise of the residual discretion: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at [24]; Reeves v The Queen [2013] HCA 57 at [10], [12], [60]-[61]. 

64Mr Coady, on behalf of the respondent, submitted that it was appropriate to exercise the residual discretion in the present case. He relied on two affidavits, of Ms Dean sworn 15 September 2014 and of the respondent sworn 15 September 2014. The evidence establishes that the applicant has been assaulted twice while in custody. Mr Coady submitted that the evidence also showed that the respondent has developed insight into his offending conduct which means that he now suffers from remorse and that his prospects of rehabilitation have improved. I do not accept this submission. That the respondent was initially prepared to divulge that he coped with depression by thinking about TW but that he no longer makes such disclosures is consistent with his appreciating that such disclosures are adverse to his interests. It does not, without more, establish either remorse or insight.

65Although the principal purpose of the determination of a Crown appeal is to give guidance to sentencing judges, the sentence actually imposed on the respondent is still of considerable importance. The need for protection of the public and the denunciation of the respondent's conduct in the present case would not, in my view, be served by an exercise of the residual discretion. 

66Nor indeed would the need for general deterrence be fulfilled were the residual discretion to be exercised. The deterrent effect of a sentence is not to be measured solely by reference to its effect on putative offenders. One of the purposes of incorporating such an element in a sentence is to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [82] per McHugh J; R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 at [264]

67Offences by men against children to whom they have access by reason of familial ties and the bonds of friendship with the children's parents, as in the present case, are particularly heinous because their commission tends to threaten and abuse the trust that such children are entitled to repose in those who ought reasonably be expected to nurture and protect them. 

68In my view, the sentence imposed was such as to create the impression that the purposes of sentencing, as provided by s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, namely, the punishment of the respondent and the protection of the victims and others like them, could be achieved by a sentence which implied a very substantial degree of concurrency between indicative sentences, for offences involving different children over an extended period of time which were prosecuted on two separate indictments. This Court is, in my view, obliged to correct that impression by re-sentencing the respondent.

69In my view, the sentence that ought to be imposed is an aggregate sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of six years and nine months.

70On re-sentence, the ratio between the total term of the aggregate sentence and the aggregate non-parole period conforms to the statutory ratio of 75% (s 44(2) of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) since I do not accept that there was a proper basis for the finding of special circumstances made by the sentencing judge. In any event, the period of parole on re-sentence is greater than that allowed under the sentence imposed by her Honour. Accordingly, any need for supervision in the community is accommodated by the re-sentence.

Proposed orders

71The orders I propose are:

(1)Appeal allowed.

(2)Quash the sentence imposed by Flannery DCJ on 28 March 2014 and in lieu thereof:

(a)Impose a sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of six years and nine months; and

(b)Note that the earliest time the respondent is eligible to be released is 17 October 2017.

2423020,The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2014] NSWSC 1345,"Judgment
1By summons filed on 21 August 2014, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, a proceeds of crime authority under s 338 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth), applied ex-parte, seeking restraining orders under s 19 of the Act in relation four sums of money totalling some $AUD145,960 seized by Australian Federal Police (""AFP"") during the execution of search warrants  in March 2014. Orders under s 38 that the money be taken into the custody of the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy were also sought.  
2The application was supported by an affidavit sworn on 20 August 2014 by Katrina Hoyes, a member of the Australian Federal Police and an authorised officer under the Act.
3The orders sought were made on 23 September 2014.  These are the reasons why I was satisfied that the orders should be made.
4Section 26 of the Act deals with the notice which must be given of applications such as this.  The application must proceed ex parte if sought by the authority (s 26(4)).
5This Court is a court with ""proceeds jurisdiction"" to make the order sought under s 19 of the Act, the alleged offences having occurred in this State and the property the subject of the orders being located here (see s 335).  Section 19 requires the making of restraining and other orders, upon satisfaction that an authorised officer who provides an affidavit supporting the application holds suspicions of the kind specified on reasonable grounds.  
6This application was supported by the affidavit sworn by Ms Hoyes as to her suspicions that the cash the subject of the application was the proceeds of an indictable and/or serious offence, namely money with a value exceeding $AUD100,000, reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime, an offence under s 400.9(1) of the Schedule to the Criminal Code (Cth).
7Ms Hoyes explained the basis for her suspicions to be, in summary that Mr Clark was selling drugs through a network of five others, earning up to $4,000 per week through those activities; he had both resources, knowledge and equipment to produce illicit drugs for sale; that the cash seized exceeded his legitimate earning capacity as a personal trainer; and that it was suspected of being the proceeds and/or instruments of serious offences.  
8She deposed that her suspicions rested on information provided by Federal Agent Wilson, the designated case officer in the investigation of Mr Lee Clark and others in a document entitled ""Facts for Court,"" dated 20 May, as well as other documents and statements referred to in her affidavit.
9This material disclosed that Mr Clark was arrested and charged after conversations 
10with others involved which were recorded under a surveillance device warrant.  In March 2014, he was recorded as having discussed the supply and manufacture of methamphetamine and cocaine with various others.  Mr Clark was also the subject of physical surveillance.  He was later arrested and charged in relation to trafficking marketable quantities of controlled drugs.  A search warrant was executed at his residence and cash suspected of being proceeds of crime, as well as various drug paraphernalia, was seized, as well as records and other materials.  Further cash was found in his car and a search of a garage unit located other drug manufacture and supply paraphernalia and records.  More cash was found in a safety deposit box, which was also identified to belong to Mr Clark.
11On the basis of Ms Hoyes' affidavits, I was satisfied both that she holds the suspicions to which she deposed and that there were reasonable grounds for those suspicions to be held.  In the result I was satisfied that the orders sought had to be made, as s 19 requires, together with examination orders under s 38.

2423069,WorkCover Authority of NSW v Gordon & Gotch Australia Pty Ltd [2014] NSWDC 376,"SENTENCE


	
	The defendant pleads guilty to a charge that, contrary to section 8(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 at Moorebank on 29 October 2010 , it failed to ensure that Mr Neil Hayward, a person not in its employment was exposed to a risk to his health and safety. The defendant is a distributor of magazines and is the occupier of the site at Moorebank to which publishers bring material for distribution.
	
	
	On the day in question a Mr Daljeet Singh delivered a 300 gram palletised load known as a skid to the premises in his own vehicle, a white Ford Transit courier van. Mr Singh had not attended the defendant’s premises before and stopped his vehicle at a position at right angles to a designated loading and unloading area facing into the warehouse.
	
	
	After Mr Singh arrived, Mr Hayward drove his Isuzu flat top truck passing behind Mr Singh’s truck and stopped in the designated unloading area. Mr Hayward was delivering a pallet of magazines printed by Yaffa Publishing. Mr Hayward was a regular visitor to the premises and had probably been properly inducted into the vehicular transport plan drawn up by the defendant.
	
	
	Mr Singh was met by Mr Matepi, an employee of the defendant who unloaded Mr Singh’s truck and then moved across to Mr Hayward’s truck.
	
	
	In order that Mr Hayward’s truck may be unloaded, it was necessary that Mr Hayward alight from the vehicle and lower the gates so that the forklift could gain access. While Mr Hayward was standing behind a gate in the course of this procedure, Mr Singh without warning reversed his vehicle in a circular motion intending to head back the way he had arrived. He did not see Mr Hayward’s truck when he entered his own vehicle and did not see Mr Hayward’s truck from his rear mirrors. He struck Mr Hayward jamming him between Mr Singh’s van and Mr Hayward’s truck. Mr Hayward suffered serious injuries and died that night. The injury should never have happened. It was foreseeable and avoidable.
	
	
	When Mr Singh arrived at the premises he stopped his truck short of the designated unloading area, but at a place where parking was not prohibited. There were no signs to indicate to Mr Singh that he should not park there.
	
	
	Although the traffic control system on the site required that trucks proceed in one direction only, there were no arrows on the ground informing drivers to that effect. The defendant did not designate a spotter or marshall who could have guided Mr Singh as he reversed to ensure that he did not endanger Mr Hayward. Those failures were institutional and the responsibility of the defendant’s managers of Occupational Health and Safety.
	
	
	The defendant was not unconscious of the need to ensure safety on the site. A traffic management system had been instituted pursuant to which contractors or clients delivering material to the site were to observe “Conditions and requirements that must be followed when delivering to the Gordon & Gotch Moorebank site”. Those conditions required that all persons entering the site must follow the site traffic management plan and that drivers were to park in front of the receiving area.
	
	
	The Conditions also required that upon first attending upon the premises, a transport contractor was to undergo a transport induction. This induction required that the driver view a traffic plan which indicated traffic flow in a one way direction and places at which deliveries were to be unloaded.
	
	
	The Traffic Management Plan appears in the form of an exhibit which constituted a plan checklist. An audit in accordance with that checklist was conducted in May 2010, only five months before the accident. The checklist confirmed that all contractors and visitors working on site were to receive induction training in regard to traffic management.
	
	
	Mr Matepi was aware of this traffic management plan. He knew that he should not have unloaded Mr Singh’s vehicle without Mr Singh first undergoing an induction process. Mr Matepi also knew that the plan required that Mr Hayward’s truck be unloaded completely before Mr Singh’s had been unloaded or the contrary.
	
	
	The evidence reveals that Mr Matepi regularly attended toolbox meetings and was aware of the traffic management systems. Had the defendant been aware that he was disobeying the traffic plan by failing to direct drivers to park in designated places or unloading vehicles in non-designated areas or failing to ensure that drivers stood in safe zones it would have counselled him.
	
	
	It seems to me that the defendant did all that was reasonable in attempting to ensure that Mr Matepi observed the safety rules. There was a system pursuant to which employees found to be in breach of safety rules were given formal warnings. The defendant held fortnightly toolbox talks, monthly on site Occupational Health and Safety committee meetings, monthly safety walks throughout the system and daily observation, supervision and instruction to ensure that the systems of work were carried out by employees and contractors.
	
	
	The gravity of the offence in respect of this charge is to be assessed upon the basis that I should consider not only Mr Hayward’s death but also the extent to which the defendant’s failings departed from the conduct of a reasonable man. I accept that there can be no graver consequence than death, but insofar as the system devised by those responsible for Occupational Health and Safety failed Mr Hayward that failure it seems to me was a failure of adversion and imagination rather than a failure that flowed from any disregard for safety.
	
	
	One major omission was the failure to erect No Parking signs. Such signs, had Mr Singh observed them, would have prevented him from parking where he did. The other failure was the failure to provide an observer or spotter to guide reversing vehicles.
	
	
	Merely installing a system of one way traffic does not obviate the occasional need and unforeseen circumstances of vehicles to be reversed and that circumstance ought have occurred to those responsible for the system. More particularly, however, the failures of Mr Matepi to which I have adverted were the major cause of Mr Hayward’s death. Mr Matepi is no longer employed by the defendant.
	
	
	The degree of culpability of a corporation is related to the seniority in the corporation’s hierarchy occupied by the person at fault.
	
	
	A failure by a subordinate employee must be seen in the light of an otherwise conscientious and detailed adversion by senior management to safely discharging the corporation’s duties under the Act.
	
	
	This defendant is a large employer employing 107 persons across Australia. In the 2012 year it expended approximately $1,271 per employee upon occupational health and safety. It has operated at least for 39 years and has no prior convictions. Given the amount of traffic that must pass through its warehouses across Australia it is an exemplary record which should be reflected in diminution of penalty.
	
	
	The defendant reacted responsibly to this tragedy and retained appropriate experts to advise and to audit their Traffic Managements Systems. Although it is after the event, I think it is most relevant that in October 2012 the holding company, PMP was a finalist in the National Safety Council Australia’s Safety Awards of Excellence.
	
	
	Mr Christopher Thomas, the National Distribution Services Manager of the defendant has expressed deep sympathy and remorse for the loss suffered by Mrs Hayward and her family.
	
	
	The maximum penalty is $550,000. Notwithstanding the powerful nature of the subjective matters, it seems to me that the need for a general deterrence, discounting for the need for a specific deterrence and the need to denounce and mark the unnecessary death of Mr Hayward call for the imposition of a penalty of $150,000.
	
	
	The defendant is entitled for a reduction of 25% in consideration of its early plea of guilty and co-operation with the authorities.
	
	
	The defendant is convicted and fined $112,500. I order that a moiety of the fine be remitted to WorkCover.
	
	
	The defendant is to pay the costs of WorkCover agreed in the sum of $27,000.

		17 February 2016",2014-10-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2423318,R v TNV [2014] NSWSC 1510,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1HER HONOUR:  TNV was arraigned before me on 16 June 2014 (the date listed for his trial) at which time he pleaded guilty to the murder of Phuc Uy Nguyen and the murder of Brian Bao Dung Huynh contrary to s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  Both deceased died from stab wounds inflicted when they were attacked outside a bar in Bankstown on 1 February 2009.  The offender participated in that attack with three co-offenders.  He was aged 17 years old at the time of the murders (having turned 17 in January 2009) and 22 at the time of sentence. 
2The offender left Australia on 6 February 2009 and travelled to Vietnam where his father resides.  He voluntarily returned to Australia on 28 March 2012.  He was arrested on 11 July 2012.
3On 12 July 2012, he participated in a lengthy recorded interview with police where he admitted being party to the attack in which the deceased died.  At the conclusion of the interview he was charged with their murder.  He has been in continuous custody since that time. 
4Murder carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  It also attracts a standard non-parole period of 20 years.  However, having regard to the offender's age at the time of the offences and the operation of s 54D(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), the standard non-parole period has no application in this sentencing exercise (see BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159; 201 A Crim R 379).
5The Crown submitted that each of the murders for which the offender is to be sentenced were above the mid range of objective seriousness.  Whether that submission is accepted depends upon the resolution of a range of factual matters the subject of contest at the sentence hearing.  
6The basis upon which the offender's culpability for the murders should be assessed was also in dispute.  The Crown submitted that he participated in a joint criminal enterprise with three co-offenders to inflict grievous bodily harm on Nguyen (and any of his friends who may have been present to support him) and that they were each armed with a knife for that purpose and with that intent.  Defence counsel submitted that I would be satisfied that the offender should be sentenced on the basis that he participated in an extended joint criminal enterprise to assault Nguyen, knowing that each of his co-offenders was armed with a knife which might be used by them (or one of them) and that either Nguyen or someone in his company might suffer grievous bodily harm as a result. 
7Each of the following persons were convicted of the murders or being an accessory after the fact to murder:
(1)Hoang Huy Nguyen (""Kevin"") was arrested on 13 October 2009 and was charged with two counts of murder.  He was found guilty after trial and, after an order for partial accumulation, was sentenced to an effective term of imprisonment of 30 years with a non-parole period of 22 years and 6 months.  He was aged 26 at the time of the murders (see R v Nguyen and Luong [2011] NSWSC 562);
(2)Minh Duc Luong (""Duc"") was also arrested on 13 October 2009 and charged with the same two counts of murder.  He pleaded guilty and, after a 10 per cent discount for the guilty pleas, was sentenced to an effective term of imprisonment of 28 years with a non-parole period of 21 years.  He was aged 18 at the time of the murders (see R v Nguyen and Luong [2011] NSWSC 562); and
(3)Jian Jin (""Rick"") was arrested on 11 May 2009 and charged with two counts of accessory after the fact to murder.  He was found guilty after trial and was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 12 months.  He was aged 22 at the time of the offence (see R v Jin [2011] NSWSC 169).
8Two other men, Manh Duong Tran (""Tran"") and Liang Xu (""Gary""), were also involved in what the Crown contends was the agreement to inflict grievous bodily harm to which this offender was a party and from which the deaths of the deceased resulted.  Neither was charged.  Tran left the jurisdiction and has not returned.  Gary was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for giving evidence in the trials of Kevin, Duc and Rick.  He has since served a sentence for an unrelated matter and was deported to China at the expiration of that sentence.
9Kevin and Duc were sentenced for the murders by McCallum J in 2011 in accordance with the approach to sentence as mandated in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168, a decision since disapproved of by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.  In sentencing Kevin after trial for each of the murders, and in sentencing Duc who pleaded guilty on the first day of trial, her Honour departed from the standard non-parole period of 20 years.    
10Although the standard non-parole period for murder has no application in these sentence proceedings, equal justice considerations which underlie the principle of parity will need to be considered in order to ensure there is no unjustified disparity between this offender's sentence and the sentences that have been imposed on Kevin and Duc.  Differences in their subjective circumstances will also need to be considered.  The maximum penalty of life imprisonment operates as a legislative guidepost in these proceedings, as it did in the proceedings of the co-offenders.  
11The fact that this offender was a juvenile at the time of the murders is a significant differentiating factor.  His chronological age, coupled with the insights into the extent of his emotional immaturity provided in the reports Mr Borenstein, a clinical psychologist, and Dr Nielssen, a forensic psychiatrist, informs the assessment of his moral culpability for the murders.  In addition, the weight to be afforded his prospects of rehabilitation, both because of his youth and the passage of time between the offending and sentence, will also need to be considered in fixing an appropriate sentence.
12On sentence, the Crown tendered a folio of documents, including the offender's electronically recorded interview with police and CCTV footage which recorded the confrontation with both deceased in the course of which they were fatally stabbed, together with the events immediately preceding and subsequent to that attack.  The applicant is clearly depicted as present on the approach to and throughout the confrontation, including running from the scene with his co-offenders.
13The offender gave evidence at the sentencing hearing.
14To a large extent, the facts relied upon by the Crown for sentencing purposes were agreed, or were not the subject of any material contest.  In addition, much of what the offender told police in the ERISP, which he repeated in his evidence, was not the subject of challenge. 
15What remained in issue was whether the evidence allows for a finding that when the offender armed himself with a knife at the invitation or direction of Kevin, and then joined with him, Duc and Tran (each of whom were also armed with knives) in approaching the bar where it was anticipated Nguyen would be in company with others, it was their joint intention to use the knives to inflict grievous bodily harm or whether that decision (if it was made at all) was only made at the point of the confrontation.  If the evidence does not allow me to find the murders were committed as part of a joint criminal enterprise, the only available basis upon which the offender is to be sentenced for murder is by the operation of an extended joint criminal enterprise to assault where the possibility of one or more offenders using the knives to inflict grievous bodily harm was contemplated by this offender.
16Whether the offender used a knife in the attack on either of the deceased was also in issue. 
17The resolution of these factual disputes will inform an assessment of this offender's criminal culpability for each of the murders.  While I am not obliged to resolve the disputes of fact in a way most favourable to him, he is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt I might have both as to whether he participated in the joint criminal enterprise alleged by the Crown, and whether he inflicted any stabs wounds as a party to that agreement or whether he was party to an extended criminal enterprise.  Were I satisfied that the offender did not actually stab either of the deceased, or that the evidence does not permit that finding to be made beyond reasonable doubt, it would follow that his criminal culpability for the murders would be lessened to some extent.  However, what remains unchanged by a finding favourable to the offender on that issue is that two unarmed men were ultimately set upon by four armed attackers (this offender being one of them), in circumstances designed to ensure that the four attackers had the tactical advantage of surprise, and that two young men died in most violent circumstances, and in a public place, as a result. 
18Although it was no part of the Crown case that this offender inflicted either of the fatal stab wounds, the Crown did maintain the submission that I would be satisfied that he inflicted at least one of the ten stab wounds sustained by Nguyen after he ran from where his friend Huynh had been attacked and was fatally stabbed a short distance away.  The Crown accepted that I might be left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the offender inflicted any of the three stab wounds sustained by Huynh.  
19Unless specifically noted, what follows are the facts that are not disputed. 
20On 1 February 2009, Nguyen was dining with friends at a restaurant in Bankstown when he thought he recognised Kevin sitting at a nearby table as a person responsible for assaulting a friend of his earlier in the year.  Nguyen and his friends confronted Kevin.  Kevin was struck by Nguyen and fled. 
21The offender gave evidence that Kevin telephoned him and asked him to come to Bankstown for what Kevin described as ""something urgent"".  He did not supply any further details and the offender did not seek them.  The offender gave the same account to police.  As will become obvious when I deal with the offender's subjective circumstances, the offender was very much in Kevin's thrall at this time in his life and, for that reason, was vulnerable to his request or demand for assistance without the need for explanation.
22In oral submissions the Crown accepted that the evidence did not support a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was told over the telephone that he was needed to assist Kevin in launching a reprisal attack on Nguyen, and that he would be armed for that purpose when he arrived.  It was the Crown submission that when he arrived at Bankstown he learned that Kevin had been assaulted by Nguyen after being falsely accused of having assaulted one of Nguyen's friends and that Kevin wanted his friends to accompany him to confront Nguyen (and anyone with whom he might have been in company) to avenge that accusation, or in retaliation at being struck, or both, and that Kevin arranged for them to be armed for that purpose.
23The offender was picked up at his home by a taxi.  Tran was in the taxi.  The offender had not previously met Tran.  Tran directed the taxi to pick up Duc, a friend of both the offender and Tran, after which they travelled to a multi-storey carpark in Bankstown.  The offender was not asked in cross-examination as to what, if anything, was said en route to Bankstown or if the offender enquired of the others as to whether they knew the reason that Kevin had summoned them.
24Gary, who gave evidence for the Crown in the trials of Kevin, Duc and Rick and whose account is summarised in the narrative statement of facts tendered before me, was also contacted by Kevin.  Gary drove to Bankstown in his car.  There was nothing in the statement of facts to suggest that Gary knew the reason he was being summoned, although it would seem to follow that Kevin had informed him of his intentions since it would seem that it was Gary and Rick who obtained or collected the knives that were brought to the meeting point and distributed.  
25On arrival at Bankstown, the offender, Duc and Tran collected Rick who was outside a bar before they met up with Kevin and Gary.  The offender had not previously met Gary.  It was at that time that a bag containing knives was retrieved from the boot of Rick's car and distributed to each of Duc, Tran and this offender by Gary.  Kevin also armed himself with a knife.  The offender gave evidence that Kevin instructed the group to use their knives, ""if anything happened"".  The statement of facts (no doubt relying upon what Gary later told police) records a conversation where Kevin said, ""I want to talk to these guys that fought me"", and that Gary and Rick both cautioned against fighting with knives.  According to the offender, he was told to keep the knife and to use it for his own protection.  In his evidence he accepted that he knew at that time that it was likely there would be a physical confrontation between Kevin and Nguyen and that he was to be there for support.  The offender's version and the Crown facts on this issue are not materially different.  The question at issue is the form of support that was asked of him and the support he ultimately provided.
26The evidence does leave room for doubt that there was an agreement forged at the time the knives were distributed that a reprisal knife attack would or be launched at Nguyen with the intention of causing him, or anyone with him, grievous bodily harm.  I am satisfied, however, that the offender agreed to join with the others to confront Nguyen, and that he had a reasonable expectation that knives might be used in that confrontation in some way, or that he contemplated that might occur, and that someone might be seriously hurt.  The fact that the offender told police that he placed the knife in the back of his trousers lends weight to that conclusion, as does the fact that he knew the other three men were also armed.  A picture of the knife the offender carried was in evidence.  It resembled a kitchen knife approximately 15 centimetres in length, including the handle.
27There is no evidence to suggest that the offender was told, or that Kevin believed, that either Nguyen or anyone in his company would be armed.  For the offender to arm himself with a knife, even on the basis that he was told or believed he may need it for protection, would suggest that he must have at least contemplated that he might use the knife proactively even if he had no plan to use it when he was first given it. 
28Shortly after the knives were distributed, the offender, Duc, Tran, Kevin and Gary were confronted by security guards patrolling the carpark and were directed to disperse.  The offender gave evidence that he did not recall that happening.  Despite there being some doubt on my review of the CCTV footage as to when and where this occurred, it is not an issue that needs to be resolved for sentencing purposes.  
29In the statement of facts it was after the knives were distributed that Gary drove the offender and Tran to Auburn where they had something to eat, only later returning to Bankstown when Gary received a telephone call from Kevin.  Call charge records obtained by police support that account.  The offender was unable to recall leaving the carpark with Gary and Tran, whether at the insistence of the security guards or otherwise.  
30I am prepared to proceed on the basis that with the passage of time the offender has simply forgotten the sequence of events on the night since it would seem from the available evidence that the whereabouts of the offender, from the time the knives were distributed from the boot of the car at about 7.45pm to the arrival of the four offenders at the bar at about 9.19pm, cannot otherwise be accounted for.  The fact that he left with Gary and returned an hour and a half later also lends weight to the Crown's submission that he did not involve himself in the confrontation that resulted in the death of both deceased impulsively.  By the time he arrived at the bar he had been in possession of a knife for over an hour and a half, with time to reflect upon the enormity of the situation in which he was involved.  The extent to which he was emotionally capable of reflecting on such matters given his particular psychosocial circumstances and stage of emotional development as a youth of barely 17 years of age, and whether that informs his moral culpability for the murders of two men, will be addressed later.   
31At approximately 9.15pm, CCTV footage records what I am satisfied is the coordinated arrival of the offender, Tran and Gary in Gary's car and the arrival of Kevin and Duc in Rick's car.  Both cars park in a carpark.  Rick and Gary wait with the cars whilst Kevin, Tran, Duc and this offender approach the bar approximately 400 metres away.
32Kevin entered the bar alone.  He emerged very shortly afterwards with Nguyen, Huynh and another male friend of Nguyen.  The offender, Duc and Tran were on the footpath.  It was common ground that an argument ensued at that time.  From the perspective afforded by the CCTV footage the argument must have almost immediately erupted into a physical fight although who did what cannot be discerned.  It was in the course of that phase of the confrontation that Huynh suffered three stabs wounds, one of which penetrated his heart causing death. 
33The offender gave evidence that he did not stab Huynh although he accepted that he had pulled out the knife that had been given to him earlier from the back of his trousers when the physical fight erupted.  In oral submissions the Crown accepted that the evidence did not allow for a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the offender inflicted any of the stab wounds suffered by Huynh.  
34I have reviewed the CCTV footage. It does not allow me to determine for myself whether or not the offender physically participated in the attack on Huynh by use of the knife.  That said, it is clear to me that he was physically present and, to all appearances, in the thick of the melee where he knew his co-offenders were armed and not standing back as he claimed in his evidence.  On his own evidence he had his knife drawn.  I propose to deal with his criminal culpability for the death of Huynh on that basis.
35Nguyen was attacked a short distance from where Huynh was stabbed, in the course of which he sustained ten stab wounds, one of which was fatal.  The Crown case was that the offender delivered one or more of the ten stab wounds.  The evidence does not allow for a finding, and the Crown does not assert, that he inflicted the fatal wound. 
36The offender gave evidence largely consistent with what he told police to the effect that that he did not stab Nguyen.  However, contrary to what he told police, he gave evidence before me that he did punch Nguyen with his left hand multiple times whilst he had the knife in his right hand with the blade pointed to the ground.  He told police that he had the knife in an outstretched hand although it is not entirely clear from the questioning whether he was referring to the phase of the attack where Nguyen was the victim or earlier, when Huynh was stabbed.  The offender gave evidence that he dropped his knife on the ground at the site where Nguyen was being attacked and that he picked it up again before fleeing on foot with the co-offenders.
37Although the CCTV footage of the attack on Nguyen is of a slightly better quality, of itself it does not allow me to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the offender actively stepped into and towards where Nguyen was being restrained or held or attacked by Duc, Tran and Kevin, and that he then thrust at or into Nguyen with a knife, as distinct from stepping in and punching him.  It does not show the knife being dropped or picked up.  Although I accept that the offender has endeavoured to give a detailed and honest account of what he actually did in the attack on Nguyen, I found his evidence on this issue unconvincing.  The question is whether the forensic evidence resolves the doubt I am left with adverse to the offender.
38As the offender fled from the scene with his co-offenders he discarded his knife by throwing it next to a bin a short distance from the bar.  He told police he was afraid he would be in trouble.  A competing and, in my view a more telling explanation, is that he was aware that he had used the knife to stab Nguyen and that the knife would, or might, link him to that assault. 
39The knife was recovered and subsequent DNA analysis of the knife revealed the following:
(1)The left side of the blade tested positive for blood and contained a mixture of DNA from both deceased.  The major contributor was Huynh and the minor contributor Nguyen; 
(2)The right side of the blade tested positive for blood and contained a mixture of DNA from two individuals.  The major contributor was Nguyen and the minor contributor this offender; and
(3)The handle of the knife tested negative for blood and did not yield any DNA samples.
40There was no evidence as to the quantity of blood in residue on the blade of the knife or the relative quantity of the blood of each of the deceased.  I accept that in a volatile multi-assailant knife attack, blood can be easily transferred between assailants and their weapons, or that the blood shed in the attack might be transferred on to a knife held by an assailant without it actually being used to inflict any stab wounds.  That may explain Huynh's blood being on the blade of the knife.  Although this is a generous interpretation of the forensic evidence, in light of the Crown concession that the evidence did not allow for a finding that the offender stabbed Huynh, it is a finding I am prepared to make.  However, it cannot, in my view, adequately account for the blood of both deceased being on the left side of the knife blade, with Nguyen as the major contributor. 
41The offender, Duc, Tran and Kevin subsequently met with Rick and Gary at Yagoona Railway Station from where they were driven to Kevin's home in Auburn.  According to Gary, the offender said, in relation to Nguyen, ""I stabbed him one time too"".  Although the offender does not dispute that he said what is attributed to him, he gave evidence that what he said was untrue and that he only claimed to have stabbed Nguyen because he was scared that Kevin, Duc, Tran and Gary would ""turn on him"".  This was consistent with his explanation to police where he said that he was afraid they would think that he was afraid and had run away.  In effect, he says he lied out of bravado.
42After taking into account the CCTV footage, the DNA evidence on the offender's discarded knife and what the offender said within a short time of the attack, and also taking into account the offender's explanation for what the CCTV footage revealed of the attack on Nguyen which he was invited to view in open court, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was responsible for at least one of the ten wounds Nguyen sustained in the attack from which he died.  I propose to deal with the offender's criminal culpability for the death of Nguyen on that basis.
43The offender subsequently learnt from his sister's friend (who had heard it on the news) that the two deceased had died.  He telephoned his father and informed him that he had done something wrong and that he was in trouble.  His father told him to return to Vietnam.  He left Australia on 6 February 2009, five days after the murders.  His father provided the money for the ticket.  Whilst in Vietnam, the offender gave evidence that he was contacted by Kevin on multiple occasions.  He was not asked by his counsel or the Crown in cross-examination about what was said or whether there were any discussions about the evidence that was being amassed against him or whether he should return to Australia.  
44The offender voluntarily returned to Australia on 28 March 2012, just over three years later.  On the Crown case, he left Australia because he knew or expected he would be charged with murder and that he returned because of the burden of his guilt.  The offender gave evidence that he left Australia because he knew he was in some general form of ""trouble"" and that he returned to Australia because he wanted to take responsibility for his participation in the events which led to the deaths of two people, notwithstanding that he did not stab either of them.  In light of my findings as to the offender's role in the attack on both Huynh and Nguyen, the latter in particular, I regard the offender's motivations in leaving the country to fall somewhere in between. 
45The offender was not in contact with any of the co-offenders upon returning to Australia.  Kevin, Duc and Rick had been tried and sentenced by that time.  He lived with his mother until his arrest.  He gave evidence that he did not surrender himself to police because he wanted to spend some time with her.  He was arrested on the initiative of the police.  There was no evidence in the proceedings as to how he was located.  The offender gave evidence that he expected to be arrested upon his arrival at the airport.  Upon his arrest he was asked by police whether he was expecting to be found, to which he responded, ""Yes"".  I accept that evidence.
46The offender's willingness to accept responsibility for his role in the murders, to the extent of his voluntary return to the jurisdiction where he knew police would eventually arrest and charge him, motivated by what I accept to be genuine remorse, is to his credit and something which is deserving of considerable weight on sentence.  It reflects the maturation and insight he has acquired as a young adult in reflecting on his past and the deaths of two people for which, by his plea, he accepts legal responsibility and which he knows will attract lengthy terms of imprisonment.  The pleas of guilty which were entered some time after his arrest and charge also reflect a willingness to facilitate the course of justice.  I propose to allow 15 per cent for the plea of guilty on each count.
The offender's subjective circumstances
47The offender gave evidence that he was born in Vietnam and raised by his maternal grandmother.  His uncle and his uncle's wife also resided with his grandmother.  His mother had left Vietnam to study in Australia when he was very young and his father had remarried.  He saw his father once a month.  The offender believed his father preferred his sister over him.  The offender attended school in Vietnam five to six days a week until he was aged ten when his grandmother was unable to afford to educate him.  He supported his grandmother financially by selling tissues and chewing gum on the streets.
48The offender and his sister were brought to Australia by his mother in 2003 after she divorced her second husband.  The offender was aged 11.  He could speak no English.  He did not have a close relationship with his mother and found it difficult to adjust to living with her.  This was compounded when she formed a new relationship.  The offender disapproved of his mother's new partner and pointed specifically to an instance where his mother and boyfriend had, unbeknownst to them, engaged in sexual intercourse in his presence which, as a young adolescent, he found very confronting. 
49Before commencing formal schooling, the offender was enrolled in an intensive English school where he met Duc.  He rarely saw his mother.  He undertook formal schooling at Canterbury Boys' High School.  Throughout his schooling he was ostracised and bullied because of his ethnicity and his poor command of English.  He did not seek the intervention of the school counselling service being unable to speak openly about his feelings with people he considered to be in authority and because he feared retaliation by the other boys.  The offender had only two friends at school, both of whom were Vietnamese and older than him.  He was marginalised and excluded from social interaction with his age specific peers.  He left high school in Year 10 because his two older friends graduated.  I am satisfied his school life was dominated by fear and that his social withdrawal and instability in his home life retarded his socialisation throughout his adolescence.
50After leaving high school, the offender was, for a brief period, an apprentice hairdresser.  However, he discontinued the apprenticeship after five months because he was late to work on several occasions and could not take the pressure of being reprimanded.  He was unemployed for a year prior to the offences.  He said he looked for work but was unsuccessful given his age and limited education.
51It was after leaving high school that the offender reunited with Duc (whom he met by chance).  Duc introduced him to Kevin who was at that stage in his early twenties.  The offender gave evidence that he associated with Kevin and Duc and their friends because he had no friends of his own and had no real connection with his mother and sister.  He thought Kevin was ""tough"" and ""cool"" although he had some fear of him.  He admired Kevin for his dominance and felt accepted by him and his friends.  He spent a great deal of time in their company.
52In the three years that the offender remained in Vietnam after the murders with his father and, at times, his grandmother, he gained employment as a waiter before working at a hair salon.  Under the influence of his grandmother, the offender adopted or renewed his Buddhist faith.  He said that, with the guidance of the monks, he reflected every day on his past and his predicament.  He gave evidence that a belief in karma ultimately led him to consider the emotions of others and to make the decision to return to Australia to accept the consequences of having participated in an armed attack where two men died. 
53The relationship between the offender and his mother is currently stable.  She has visited and supported him whilst he has been on remand.  She also visited him three times whilst he was in Vietnam.  His grandmother, to whom he has a strong attachment, is aged and unwell.  I accept that he feels deep sadness that he will not see her before she dies. 
The reports from Mr Borenstein and Dr Nielssen 
54Mr Borenstein noted in his report that the offender does not currently suffer from any developmental disorder, severe mood disorder or any other major psychiatric disorder, although in his youth he was likely to have been affected by an attachment disorder.  Mr Borenstein said:
...Those who suffer attachment disorders are known to develop behaviours defined either by acting out or a strong desire to fit in and deny one's own feelings in order to do so, as has been the case for [the offender].  [The offender] feels he grew up when he returned to Vietnam.  He returned to Australia prepared to do what is necessary to ensure he does not follow others at expense to himself.
55In Mr Borenstein's opinion, the offender's poor decision making and his inability to appreciate the consequences of his actions, culminating in his involvement in the offences for which he is to be sentenced, was a product of his youth and immaturity.  He said:
[The offender's] personality is defined by passivity and submissiveness.  [The offender] deferred to those in authority.  His early beginnings set up a life script, defined by lack of trust and desire to fit in with others.
There is nothing in [the offender's] history to indicate he would instigate the sort of behaviour which brings him before the Court.  [The offender's] history supports the notion he is one who would try to fit in and go along with others, more so if [the offender] is fearful of them, evidenced by his behaviour when bullied in high school.
[The offender] lacks a sense of self from which to assert himself and establish boundaries...56Dr Nielssen noted that the offender does not have a history of drug use or any antisocial behaviour other than the subject offences.  
57Dr Nielssen reported that the offender has managed life stressors and demands in the past with avoidance or passivity.  He also diagnosed the offender as having an attachment disorder which is manifest in his strong desire to fit in with others.  Dr Nielssen opined that the offender's involvement in the offences was contrary to his personal history as a young adolescent and that he was caught up in events from which he could not extricate himself because of his age and lack of emotional maturity.  He observed:
...Adolescence is recognised to be a period in which parts of the brain, especially the frontal lobes that are important in abstract thinking and social judgement, have not fully matured, and [the offender's] emotional and neurological immaturity is likely to have contributed to his poor decision making and impaired ability to consider the likely consequences of his actions.
The significance of the offender's youth
58Because the offender was a juvenile when the murders were committed, it is necessary to refer to s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW), despite the fact that he is to be sentenced according to law and that he is now a young adult.  Section 6 provides:
A person or body that has functions under this Act is to exercise those functions having regard to the following principles: 
(a)  that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them,
(b)  that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance,
(c)  that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption,
(d)  that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home,
(e)  that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind,
(f)  that it is desirable that children who commit offences be assisted with their reintegration into the community so as to sustain family and community ties,
(g)  that it is desirable that children who commit offences accept responsibility for their actions and, wherever possible, make reparation for their actions,
(h)  that, subject to the other principles described above, consideration should be given to the effect of any crime on the victim.
In this case (b), (f) and (g) have particular application.
59In KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; 182 A Crim R 571 at [24]-[26] McClellan CJ at CL summarised the rationale behind s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act and reviewed the authorities relating to sentencing juveniles, as to which his Honour observed:
[24] Although accepted to be of less significance than when sentencing adults, considerations of general deterrence and retribution cannot be completely ignored when sentencing young offenders. There remains a significant public interest in deterring antisocial conduct. In R v Pham & Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 Lee CJ at CL said (at 135):
""It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court's function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes...""
[25]The emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, may be moderated when the young person has conducted himself or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity (R v Bus, unreported NSWCCA, 3 November 1995, Hunt CJ at CL; R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [9]-[10], R v TJP [1999] NSWCCA 408 at [23]; R v LC [2001] NSWCCA 175 at [48]; R v AEM Snr, KEM and MM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [96]-[98]; R v Adamson (2002) 132 A Crim R 511 at [31]; R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [16]). In determining whether a young offender has engaged in 'adult behaviour' (Voss at [14]), the court will look to various matters including the use of weapons, planning or pre-meditation, the existence of an extensive criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offence (Adamson at [31]-[32]). Where some or all of these factors are present the need for the rehabilitation of the offender may be diminished by the need to protect society.
[26] The weight to be given to considerations relevant to a person's youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity (R v Hoang [2003] NSWCCA 380 at [45]). A 'child-offender' of almost eighteen years of age cannot expect to be treated substantially differently from an offender who is just over eighteen years of age (R v Bus, R v Voss at [15]). However, the younger the offender, the greater the weight to be afforded to the element of youth (Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451; [2001] NSWCCA 37 at [27]).
60In this case, the objective gravity of the offences for which the offender is to be sentenced is above the mid range.  His own conduct in the commission of the offences as I have determined it to be, although of a different order to the criminality of Kevin and Duc, does not automatically lead to a reduction in his sentence.  That said, Duc was sentenced on the basis that he admitted stabbing both deceased, and Kevin on the basis that he was the instigator of what McCallum J was satisfied was a ""common purpose to inflict grievous bodily harm on both victims"".  Independent of this offender's youth, I consider his moral culpability to be less than that of Kevin and Duc.  Although his rehabilitation is a consideration of particular importance given his youth at the time of the murders, it is nonetheless necessary for the sentences to reflect the need for general deterrence, denunciation and punishment (see IE v R [2008] NSWCCA 70; 183 A Crim R 150 at [6]; MJ v R [2010] NSWCCA 52 at [37]-[39]; and JT v R [2011] NSWCCA 128 at [34]-[35]). 
61I have already referred to the reports tendered on sentence.  In addition to the matters which I have summarised above, and accepting the difficulty which attends predictions of reoffending in a sentencing process that will inevitably conclude with an effective sentence of many years duration, in this case I am confident there is no risk of this offender misconducting himself in this way again.  Factors countering against the risk of him reoffending include the insight he has gained into the contextual circumstances that led to his offending, his renewed attachment to his mother and his commitment to study whilst in custody with a view to enhancing his vocational prospects upon his release. 
Parity
62The principle of parity derives from the fundamental norm of equal justice.  In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [28] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel J, their Honours said of equal justice:
It requires, so far as the law permits, that like cases be treated alike. Equal justice according to law also requires, where the law permits, differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law. As Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 608, [65]:""Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect."".
63I consider there are sufficient points of dissimilarity in the subjective circumstances of this offender from that of Duc and Kevin to allow for a different sentencing outcome in this case.  As I have already noted, on the Crown case, Kevin was the instigator of the plan to inflict grievous bodily harm on both deceased and significantly older than this offender, and Duc admitted to stabbing both deceased, both men having participated in a joint criminal enterprise to inflict grievous bodily harm - an offence of greater objective seriousness than the basis upon which I have found this offender to be criminally liable referable to the evidence before me.  Although Duc was a young man, being 18 at the time of the offence, he was sentenced as an adult.  Her Honour did take his youth into account in assessing his culpability but made no finding that he acted at Kevin's direction.  She did find that his pleas of guilty indicated some qualified acceptance of responsibility for the deaths of the deceased.  Her Honour knew little of Duc's personal or family circumstances to inform the question whether his Vietnamese heritage would occasion him any particular hardship in custody, and little or nothing of his social circumstances.  
64The most significant difference between the sentences imposed by her Honour and the sentence I propose to impose on this offender is that no standard non-parole period applies in these proceedings.  In addition, the offender was not only a juvenile at law but, as I have found, he was impressionable and vulnerable to the domination of others and the influence of a peer group in which he was the youngest.  Despite his participation in the extended joint criminal enterprise that resulted in the death of two people, I consider that leniency can be afforded him.  
65I propose to adopt the same approach as did her Honour to the principle of totality and to accumulate the sentences to be imposed for each offence by four years.  Given the need for this offender to have an extended period on parole, there will be some variation to the statutory ratio that would otherwise apply under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act despite the length of his sentence

2423330,JWM v R [2014] NSWCCA 248,"Judgment

1The appellant, JWM, stood for trial in the District Court of New South Wales before his Honour Judge Ellis and a jury of twelve. On 25 September 2012, following a seven-day trial, the appellant was found guilty of four counts of indecent assault on a child under the age of 16 years (s 61E(1) Crimes Act 1900) and four counts of aggravated sexual assault with a child between the ages of 10 and 16 years (s 66(2) Crimes Act).

2On 6 March 2013 the appellant was sentenced to an effective total head sentence of 5 years 8 months with a total effective non-parole period of 2 years 2 months. He is eligible for parole on 4 May 2015.

3The appellant seeks to appeal his conviction. There is no application for leave to appeal in respect of the sentences imposed. 

4The appellant was arraigned upon indictment containing 11 counts of alleged criminal sexual offending - six counts of indecent assault, one of indecency towards the complainant and four counts of having sexual intercourse (one object/vaginal; 3 penile/vaginal). All charges alleged that the complainant (the appellant's step-daughter) was under the age of 16 years. The four sexual intercourse charges stipulated that the complainant had reached at least 10 years of age. The four charges of sexual intercourse also alleged a circumstance of aggravation, namely, that the complainant was under the authority of the appellant at the time of each alleged offence. 

5The 11 counts on the indictment, to which the appellant entered not guilty pleas, were as follows:

Counts 1-2: Between 1 February 1984 and 13 March 1985 at Korora in the State of New South Wales did assault the complainant and at that time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon the complainant a person then under the age of 16 years, contrary to s 61E(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.

Counts 3-5: Between 1 February 1984 and 13 March 1985 at Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales did assault the complainant and at that time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon the complainant a person then under the age of 16 years, contrary to s 61E(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.

Count 6: Between 1 February 1984 and 13 March 1985 at Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales did commit an act of indecency toward the complainant a person then under the age of 16 years, contrary to s 61E(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.

Count 7: Between 1 February 1984 and 13 March 1985 at Korora in the State of New South Wales did assault the complainant and at that time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon the complainant a person then under the age of 16 years, contrary to s 61E(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.

Count 8: Between 1 December 1987 and 31 January 1988 at Korora in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, namely 12 or 13 years and at the time under the authority of JWM, contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.

Counts 9-10: Between 7 December 1987 and 21 November 1988 at Korora in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, namely 12 or 13 years and at the time under the authority of JWM, contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.

Count 11: Between 1 February 1988 and 31 December 1989 at Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, namely 13 or 14 years and at the time under the authority of JWM, contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.

6At trial the appellant was represented by Mr Loomes of counsel.

7The trial commenced on 17 September 2012 and concluded on 25 September 2012. The jury returned guilty verdicts in relation to Counts 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11, and not guilty verdicts in relation to Counts 1, 2 and 7. 

8The appellant was sentenced on 6 March 2013. His Honour imposed an effective sentence of imprisonment for 5 years 8 months, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years 2 months commencing 5 March 2013 and expiring on 4 May 2015, with a balance of term of 3 years 6 months, commencing 5 May 2015 and expiring on 4 November 2018.

9As noted above, the appellant appeals against his conviction only. On 18 October 2013, a Notice of Appeal together with Grounds of Appeal were filed.

Grounds of Appeal

10The Grounds of Appeal as set out in the Notice of Appeal are in the following terms:

(1)The learned trial judge failed to provide a judgment finding the complainant's statement to KG (circa 1990-1) that she was [then] a virgin fell within subsection (4) of s 293 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 in circumstances where defence counsel was intending to use the complainant's claim of virginity to demonstrate a prior inconsistent statement thereby depriving the appellant of strong inconsistent evidence on the issue of sexual penetration in his favour and of evidence impeaching the complainant's credibility.

(2)(i) His Honour erred in failing to consider whether to grant leave to the defence to cross-examine the complainant in terms provided by s 299D and s 300 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 thereby depriving the appellant of an opportunity of cross-examining the complainant on weakness in her initial complaint. 

(ii) His Honour failed to grant leave to cross-examine the complainant in respect of material contained in her statement 15/10/05 (Voir Dire Exhibit 2 paragraph 46) namely ""When talking to Dr White I told her that I thought I had been sexually molested as a child. Dr White said, 'Are you sure, or do you think you were?' I was not happy with this, so I never went back to see her"". Thereby depriving the appellant of strong inconsistent evidence in his favour and evidence impeaching the complainant's credibility. 

(3)(i) His Honour erred in failing to warn the jury in specific terms that the evidence of ""pretext"" relied upon by the complainant as a basis for initiating conversation with the accused on 23 September 2008 about past complained of sexual assault (Exh C in the trial), namely her concern that the things that had happened to her (involving the accused) would not happen to her children; could not be used by the jury as tendency evidence. Thereby leaving it open for the prosecution and the jury to use the ""pretext"" as tendency evidence.

(ii) Excluding references to the frankfurt episode, his Honour failed to link all other sexual references covered in the pretext conversation to context evidence and the jury had no reason to regard his directions in respect of context evidence as applying to historical sexual matters referenced in the 'pretext' conversation.

(iii) That evidence originating from Exhibit C, namely ""pretext"" evidence was open to the jury to be used in an impermissible way, namely as tendency evidence thereby exposing the accused to the impermissible use of evidence thus tainting his trial.

(4)The verdict ""of Guilty"" in respect of Count 10 should be set aside because of an inaccurate description by the learned trial judge of the facts and circumstances required to be proved by the Crown and there were being alleged by the Crown as constituting that offence.

(5)The verdict of ""Guilty"" in respect of Count 11 should be set aside because of an inaccurate description by the learned trial judge of the facts and circumstances required to be proved by the Crown and there were being alleged by the Crown as constituting that offence.

11On the hearing of the appeal in this Court, Mr J Nicholson SC appeared on behalf of the Appellant. The Court had the benefit of detailed written submissions on behalf of the appellant dated 17 October 2013 in support of the grounds of the appeal. Mr Nicholson developed his written arguments in relation to grounds 1, 2 and 3 in his oral submissions.

12The Crown filed a document, ""Crown Submissions- Summary of Trial"" (""Summary of Trial"") on 22 April 2014. The Crown also relied upon written submissions dated 19 April 2014. 

Facts

13I extract below the facts contained in the Crown's Summary of Trial relating to the counts on which the appellant was found guilty:

""COUNTS 3 & 4 - Indecent Assault, for which the appellant was found guilty.

When the complainant was aged about 8 to 10 years old they moved to...Coffs Harbour where she lived with her mother and the complainant for a short time. She transferred to the [school] and by that time she had taken the surname of the appellant. The Coffs Harbour Creek was nearby. On several occasions she accompanied the appellant to fish for yabbies in a spot in the creek opposite the porpoise pool. Sometimes her mother came but usually it was just her and the appellant. It was like a 'father and daughter thing' that they did together (T9-11).

On this particular occasion the complainant was wearing a blue two piece swimsuit that was joined with a tie at the sides. The appellant knelt down near the sandbank in the water and the complainant sat on his lap facing away from him. The water was up to her middle. He pulled the part of her swimsuit bottom which covered her vagina to the side. He touched her vagina for a while with his hand (Count 3) and then pulled out his penis and manoeuvred it against her vagina (Count 4) and slowly moved her hips. They were in a public area but in a secluded part and the complainant did not see anyone around at the time. The incident happened often but the complainant remembered that instance. The appellant was wearing shorts and a button up shirt and she was wearing her blue crop-top swimsuit. The incident took place during the day and they had walked there from home carrying a bucket with lines and sinkers. She could not recall if any words were spoken (T11-12).

COUNT 5 - Indecent Assault & COUNT 6 - Act of Indecency: for which counts the appellant was found guilty.

While they were still living at...Coffs Harbour the complainant was at home in the lounge-room with the appellant. She would have been about 9 or 10 years old at the time. The appellant went and fetched a mustard colour massager about 20 centimetres long. It had a white square head which vibrated. There was a single level step in the lounge-room near the big copper-coloured glass window. The complainant was lying on the floor with her head on the step. She was not wearing any underwear at the time (T17-19).

He put the massager on my vagina, I spread my legs open and he put the massager on my vagina, it was on a high speed so I said ouch and he turned the speed down a little bit (T19.37) (Count 5).

The complainant had seen the massager before. It was usually kept in the bottom drawer of the appellant's three-drawer bedside table. It was not battery operated and needed to be plugged in. When the appellant was holding the massager against her vagina she was lying down propped up by the step and he was kneeling in front of her. [He] then put the massager on himself. He put it on the tip of his penis (T20-21) (Count 6).

[H]e was putting it on him and then he ejaculated and he pulled out a hanky and it was a blue and white hanky and he put the hanky over the top of his penis and squeezed his penis and then did a chuckle when he was ejaculating, he would chuckle when he would ejaculate (T21.42).

The complainant's mother was not home when this incident occurred. Similar incidents did not happen all the time but were a 'regular occurrence' during the week - 'Yes he would get me to masturbate him, he would masturbate me, he would use the massager on me, he would get me to use the massager on him' (T22.23).

They lived at...Street for about six months and then they moved back to...Korora. In 1985 when the complainant was 10 years old her Aunty [M] and two of her children arrived in Australia and lived with them at [Korora] for three or four months. Aunty [M] brought [two children] with her and a third child ... arrived later. During the time that Aunty [M] and her children lived with them the sexual activity between the appellant and the complainant stopped. When Aunty [M] married [GH] in September 1985 she and the children moved into their own house. The complainant, her mother and the appellant continued to live at [Korora]. Another relative, Aunty [L], also came from the Philippines and stayed with them for a little bit during the time they lived at [Korora] (T23-25).

...

COUNT 8 - Sexual intercourse, person above 10 years and under 16 years, under authority, for which the appellant was found guilty.

The complainant started high school in 1988 at the...School. In 1988 her mother and the appellant started operating the takeaway food shop [at the Service Station]. The complainant would sometimes help out in the morning and the afternoons. She had a bluey grey uniform with her name on it. It looked like a nurses' outfit. It was a takeaway shop and was open early in the morning until late at night. The complainant would work there helping her mother, the appellant or Aunty [M] (T32-33).

Shortly before the complainant started high school in 1988 they were given a list of stationery to purchase. The complainant went and bought some pens, paper and some Clag glue. The bottle of glue had a red top with a little brush on a stick that went in and out of the glue (T33).

They were living at [Korora] at the time and one evening she and the appellant were watching a pornographic movie. For some reason the complainant went to her bedroom and got the glue and pulled the stick from the lid and wiped it with a tissue. She experimented by inserting the end of the red stick, opposite the little brush, in her vagina to see if she could do it. The movie the complainant and the appellant had been watching showed people having sexual intercourse. The complainant wanted to see if she could do it because she wanted to please the appellant by doing what they were doing on the video. She then came out of her bedroom and said to the appellant that she could do that - referring to the people on the video having sex. The appellant said, 'Are you sure?' and the complainant said, 'Yes' (T34-35).

We went to the kitchen and opened the fridge and he opened a packet of frankfurts and he pulled out the frankfurt and we then went to his bedroom with the frankfurt, I laid on the end of the bed the same way as last time near the pillows my bottom on -because I was - I was lying down with my bottom on the end of the bed. He then took the Vaseline from the top of his drawer, he put the Vaseline on the frankfurt and then he put it, inserted the frankfurt in me (Count 8) (T35.10).

This event occurred either at the end of 1987 or early 1988 as the complainant started high school at the end of January 1988. The complainant turned 13 years old on...January 1988. That incident was the only time a frankfurt or an item like that was used in that way (T35).

COUNT 9 - Sexual intercourse, person above 10 years and under 16 years, under authority, for which the appellant was found guilty.

Her parents bought a vacant piece of land...which was at the bottom corner of the street where they lived at...Korora. The vacant piece of land had a few plants and a Macadamia Tree on it (T35-36).

Yes, [the appellant] and I went to the property, there was some sandy clay delivery, there was a big mound of sand clay material, beside that there was a macadamia tree that was in season and ready for harvesting for the macadamia nuts, [the appellant] and I went to [the vacant land] and half filled the bucket of macadamia nuts. We then returned to [Korora] into [the appellant's office which is directly underneath the house kind of in front of the garage. We then opened the macadamia nuts with a vice that - I think it was like a clamp that held things together and we put the macadamia nuts in between it to crack it open. While we were doing that, [the appellant] was behind me and he bent me over so he was behind me and inserted his penis into my vagina and he said, ""You have to be quiet, your mum is upstairs,"" and then when he did ejaculate he would then bring out a hanky out of his pocket, he would ejaculate into the hanky and he would chuckle, that same sound (Count 9) (T36.19).

That was not the first occasion the appellant placed his penis in her vagina. This incident was after the incident with the Clag glue stick and occurred when she was already at high school.

COUNT 10 - Sexual intercourse, person above 10 years and under 16 years, under authority, for which the appellant was found guilty.

The complainant remembered one incident of penile vaginal intercourse with the appellant when her mother came home unexpectedly.

Yes there was one evening when my mother was either at TAFE, most probably at the...Service Station, she wasn't expected home at that time, [the appellant] and I went to their bedroom, I was on the edge of the bed again, he would have sex with me and he would bounce the bed like that beside my hips and then he would pull out and ejaculate in a hanky and do the same chuckle (T37.35).

While the appellant had his penis in her vagina he would put his hands on the edge of the bed and bounce her so that her bottom would go up and down.

Yes I would be lying across the bed with my feet - I can't remember whether it was up or down but he would put his hands beside my hips and he would bounce himself - bounce me for the - he was going so he wasn't moving, I was only moving (T38.3).

The appellant had his penis in her vagina and he was bouncing the bed. The main bedroom was right above the garage and they had a Gemini car that was quite loud - 'I heard the car or we heard the car drive up the driveway, we then stopped in the middle of it, I went and got dressed, I ran to my bedroom and I pretended to be asleep when my mum came home'. As soon as the complainant heard the car she bolted to her bedroom and pretended to be asleep. That was the only time they nearly got caught (Count 10) (T38).

There were other occasions the appellant and the complainant had sexual intercourse but the complainant could not particularise the occasions. One morning in early 1988 she was at school and the teacher was giving a talk about what the classes would be like. They were in the school library and the class was sitting around all bunched up together. The complainant was sitting next to a boy by the name of Matthew...and he made a comment to his friend like, ""something stinks"" or ""something smells"". The complainant immediately felt very embarrassed and self-conscious because she had not showered after having vaginal sex with the appellant that morning and she smelled of sex. Her mother used to go to work at the [the Service Station] early in the morning so she and the appellant were alone early in the mornings. She was not able to recall any more particulars about the event (T39-40).

COUNT 11 - Sexual intercourse, person above 10 years and under 16 years, under authority, for which the appellant was found guilty.

The complainant would occasionally work at the [Service Station]. Sometimes it would be in the morning to help prepare for the day and sometimes it would be in the afternoon after school.

Q. Did something ever happen at the [Service Station]?
A. Yes, yes, [the appellant] and I were at the [Service Station], there was a room in the back where my mum could sleep if she needed to, there was a bed there as well, I remember I had my uniform on.

Q. Which uniform?
A. Sorry, my...Service Station uniform, I was on the edge of the bed so the foot of the bed and [the appellant] then proceeded to have sex with me, penile vaginal intercourse (Count 11) (T40.15).

Usually when she had her uniform on it was the weekend because otherwise she would be on her way to school. The uniform was a grey-bluey dress like a nurses' uniform with a zip all the way to the top. She did not take the uniform off to have intercourse with the appellant, it was just pulled up. No-one else was present or working at the time. The complainant was about 13 or 14 years old. She could not recall if any words were spoken when he placed his penis into her vagina (T40-41).

The complainant's mother and the appellant ran the takeaway shop for a couple of years and then her aunty took over the shop. She could not recall when that happened (T41). The complainant was 13 years old in 1988 and 14 years old in 1989. She had sexual intercourse with the appellant during 1988, 1989 and 1990. One night in 1990 she went to the movies with her girlfriend and met a boy called [KG]. From then onwards there was no further sexual contact between her and the appellant (T42).

The complainant left high school at the end of Year 10 and went to the Philippines for a while. When she returned she attended a business college for six months. Afterwards she got a job...at an eye surgery in Coffs Harbour and worked there for six months. At the end of that year she took the first bus out of Coffs Harbour which happened to be going to Sydney. She did not tell anyone about what had happened with the appellant because she was very ashamed of it and she did not want anyone to judge her. She told her husband about it when she was 30 years old (T43).""

14It was the Crown's case at trial that the appellant committed the alleged offences between 1 February 1984 and 31 December 1989 during which period the complainant was aged between 9 and 14 years old. The appellant's case was that none of the charged incidents occurred. 

Evidence at Trial

15Both the appellant and the complainant gave evidence at the trial.

16The complainant gave evidence that in February 2005 she attended a self-help program aimed at people wanting to succeed in life. She said that when the lecturer asked if anyone wanted to share something about his or her upbringing and past experiences, she said ""I believe I was sexually assaulted, sexually abused as a child"". The complainant gave evidence at trial and confirmed that when she said ""I believe"", she meant ""I know"": T 49. 

17Prior to this and her consultations with a psychiatrist, Dr White, the complainant had not made any complaint regarding the appellant. She said this was because she was embarrassed and ashamed: T 49-50. However, she later told her husband: T 50.

18The complainant then made a statement to the police in late 2005.

19In respect of three alleged occasions of inappropriate behaviour by the complainant after she turned 16 years old, she said in evidence that she could not recall two of those occasions. She was also adamant that no sexual conduct or activity occurred between her and the appellant after she started dating another school student, KG, in July 1990: T 59. She maintained that the acts that were the subject of all her other complaints did in fact occur: T 35-36.

20The appellant gave evidence that he had a vasectomy in 1968, and that since then he had suffered difficulties with his sexual function. He was not able to obtain an erection without using medication: T 94; T 144-145. However, in an undated letter which was marked as MFI 13 during the trial, he wrote ""Her approach had been of her own making...I had no need for more sexual gratification than I already had with [the complainant's mother]"".

21The appellant repeatedly denied all the charges against him and said that none of the allegations of sexual impropriety made against him were true: T 102-103.

Ground 1

22The Crown observed that ground 1 of the appeal concerns an application to cross-examine the complainant, the application at trial having been made pursuant to s 293(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. However, on appeal, the appellant relied upon s 293(4) of that Act. The Crown observed in its written submissions at [4] that where an application is made at trial on one basis, and a different basis is advanced on appeal, the applicant (the appellant in the present case) requires leave pursuant to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules: Bin Sulaeman v R [2013] NSWCCA 283 at [121]-[132].

23As to the other grounds of appeal, the Crown observed that they concerned matters that were not the subject of any application at trial. Accordingly the appellant requires leave to argue all grounds.

24As earlier noted, Ground 1 is in the following terms:

""The learned trial judge failed to provide a judgment finding the complainant's statement to KG (circa 1990-1) that she was [then] a virgin fell within subsection (4) of s 293 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 in circumstances where defence counsel was intending to use the complainant's claim of virginity to demonstrate a prior inconsistent statement thereby depriving the appellant of strong inconsistent evidence on the issue of sexual penetration in his favour and of evidence impeaching the complainant's credibility.""

25By notice entitled ""Notice of Defence Questions s 293 Criminal Procedure Act"" dated 7 September 2012 the appellant sought leave to cross-examine the complainant on a number of matters. These were set out in paragraphs 1 to 4 of the Notice. Paragraph 2 related to specified matters concerning the relationship between the complainant and her high school boyfriend, KG, in about 1990. Specifically, that KG was her first experience of sexual intercourse and that she was a virgin prior to that, as well as the nature of her relationship with KG.

26Paragraph 2 of the Notice was in the following terms:

""2. The relationship between [KG] referred to in the last 5 lines of paragraph 36 and associated matters in paragraphs 37 to 41 of the complainant's statement dated 1/12/05. The defence relies on s 293(6) in so far as the absence of the evidence would imply that all of the complainant's sexual experience was obtained at the hands of the accused and/or that her attempt to take her own life was caused by the accused's actions without any other cause. The defence have taken a brief statement from [KG] on the basis of which it is proposed to put to the complainant:

- they were both students; and
- that the relationship with [KG] lasted approximately 10 months; and
- the relationship was in Years 10 and 11 at High School;
- [KG] was told that it was her first sexual intercourse and specifically she told him she was a virgin; and
- their relationship during that period involved frequent acts of consensual intercourse; and
- it is untrue to suggest or imply that the complainant did not enjoy having sexual intercourse with [KG] as she has asserted;
- the intercourse between them culminated in a pregnancy; and
- this pregnancy caused a personal crisis for the complainant leading to a suicide attempt by the complainant;
- and the complainant asked the accused for money to travel to Queensland for a termination;
- it is proposed to call [KG] on the voir dire, and if permissible, on the hearing to depose to these matters.""

27On the first day of the trial the appellant argued he was entitled to a ruling under s 293(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act permitting cross-examination. Section 293(1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) provides, so far as is relevant:

""(1) This section applies to proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence.

(2) Evidence relating to the sexual reputation of the complainant is inadmissible.

(3) Evidence that discloses or implies:

(a) that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or

(b) has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity,

is inadmissible.

(4) Subsection (3) does not apply:

(a) if the evidence:

(i) is of the complainant's sexual experience or lack of sexual experience, or of sexual activity or lack of sexual activity taken part in by the complainant, at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, and

(ii) is of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed,

...

(5) A witness must not be asked:

(a) to give evidence that is inadmissible under subsection (2) or (3), or

(b) by or on behalf of the accused person, to give evidence that is or may be admissible under subsection (4) unless the court has previously decided that the evidence would, if given, be admissible.

(6) If the court is satisfied:

(a) that it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution against the accused person that the complainant has or may have, during a specified period or without reference to any period:

(i) had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual experience, of a general or specified nature, or

(ii) had taken part in, or not taken part in, sexual activity of a general or specified nature, and

(b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication,

the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified.""

28Submissions on the voir dire were made on this and other applications on the first day of the trial (17 September 2012). 

29On this appeal, as noted above, the appellant sought to rely upon the exception to s 293(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, as contained in s 293(4). It was submitted on behalf of the appellant:

""...the jury was entitled to know of the inconsistency between her statement to [KG] that she was a virgin and her evidence before the jury of numerous instances of sexual penetration. That evidence could have been divorced from the sexual relationship evidence with [KG]."" (Appellant's Written Submissions at p 8)

30Accordingly, it was also submitted that:

""Questions establishing she had a conversation with [KG] circa 1990 in which she declared to him that she was a virgin and that such a statement was inconsistent with her present evidence should have been permitted. The probative value of such a question both as to the factual issues in the trial, and the credit of the complainant are pungent. Raised in the limited way indicated, such questions do not raise any issue of relationship with [KG]."" (at p 8)

31Further, the appellant submitted, such evidence could have been capable of being regarded by the jury as evidence relating to an absence of sexual relationship existing at the time of the commission of the offences. 

32However, the trial judge in the course of a voir dire stated:

""She is not entitled to tell the jury she's a virgin in any event. All that goes to what - to matters that are prohibited, and it's especially appropriate here because it doesn't matter what, if any, was her level of sexual activity outside of any allegation against your client. Because this is not a consensual situation. It's a question of fact here as to whether there was any sexual contact which can be sheeted home to your client...So the only issue is a factual issue about whether your client did the things alleged in that indictment or any of them."" (T 10-11, 17 September 2012)

33The following exchange also took place between defence counsel and the trial judge:

""LOOMES: Is your Honour tending towards ruling against the word 'virgin', telling [KG] that--

HIS HONOUR: Well it's the only, it's the problematic word because of the general implication. If it's kept specifically to this accused, then it isn't a problem. But as soon as you bring in the generality, you bring in experience..."" (T 31:1-7, 17 September 2012)

34Later that day defence counsel said ""[KG's] gone so that's that and I understand you Honour's ruling, providing I don't use the V word"": T 47:32-33, 17 September 2012.

35Shortly thereafter the trial judge raised the possible use of this evidence for a non-hearsay purpose. At the conclusion of that day's proceedings, his Honour made a number of formal rulings, including the following:

""I formally rule that no evidence can be led from [KG] in relation to his relationship with the complainant...I'll leave as a reserve question the decision as to whether the conversation regarding her, whether she had had - whether she'd had any sexual intercourse before year 10 for instance/that she was a virgin at that time, I will leave that for further consideration."" (T 49, 17 September 2012)

36The next morning, 18 September 2012, the trial judge and counsel for both parties again returned to the matters relating to the voir dire on the previous day and the need to mark certain documents as voir dire exhibits. Counsel indicated that they had reached agreement on various outstanding matters. At that time, defence counsel said: ""And I think you've made rulings on all the other things though"": T 14:18, 18 September 2012. The application to cross-examine the complainant was not renewed.

37The appellant submitted on this appeal that the question as to whether defence counsel was entitled to cross-examine the plaintiff on the matters outlined above was reserved. Further, that ""it was a matter the defence was entitled to a decision upon, notwithstanding defence counsel's observation referred to above may have contributed to the trial judge's oversight of the question 'reserved'"": Appellant's Written Submissions at p 10. The appellant noted that defence counsel thereafter proceeded to conduct the trial as though he was not entitled to raise the matter.

38Additionally, it was submitted that the correct decision would have been to rule that the complainant's statement to KG as to her virginity fell within s 293(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act, and that defence counsel should have been allowed to cross-examine the complainant on her claim of virginity to demonstrate a prior inconsistent statement. 

39The appellant argued that the trial judge's failure to permit cross-examination in accordance with s 293(4):

""...denied the defence an opportunity to confront globally the allegations (via both contextual matters and indicted charges) being made by referring to the complainant's circa-1990-1 'virginity' claim, and to attack the credit of the complainant."" (Appellant's Written Submissions at p 10)

40In his oral submissions Mr Nicholson submitted that the ""event"" within the meaning of s 293(4) was ""the absence of an event"". The following exchange is recorded in the transcript of the appeal hearing in this Court:

""HULME J: It's got to be evidence of events that are part of a connected set of circumstances so are you saying the event is her being a virgin?

NICHOLSON: To the extent that an absence of sexual experience can be an event, it is the state of virginity."" (T 8:42-46, 29 April 2014)

41The oral submissions for the appellant therefore sought to take issue with the Crown as to what was the ""event"" (or, as discussed below, the ""non-event"", being the asserted stated of virginity) for the purposes of the second limb of s 293(4)(a)(ii), a matter discussed under ""Consideration"" below.

42The Crown submitted that the threshold question is whether the complainant's statement disclosed sexual experience or lack thereof, and if it did, whether the prohibition in s 293(3) was enlivened. The statement by the complainant to KG that she was a virgin discloses an assertion of a lack of sexual experience on the part of the complainant: Crown's Written Submissions at [27]. Therefore, it is inadmissible in light of the prohibition contained in sub-section (3). The appellant's submission that the statement of virginity was relevant to the complainant's credibility was said by the Crown, in my view correctly, to have been inconsistent with those provisions: T 24: 8-24, 29 April 2014. 

43The Crown further observed that the remaining question was whether the complainant's statement to KG occurred at or about the time of the alleged prescribed sexual offences and ""formed part of a connected set of circumstances"". The Crown submitted that it did not. Rather, the relevant ""events"" for the purposes of s 293(4)(a) are the charged acts of sexual intercourse on the one hand, and the complainant's statement to KG on the other. Therefore:

""Whilst cross-examination of the complainant on her statement that she was a virgin might go to the credit of the complainant, it was not so connected to the commission of the offences alleged that it bore on the objective likelihood of their commission."" (at [28])

44Mr Nicholson submitted to the contrary that the events were connected, in the sense that any statement regarding never having sexual intercourse would be connected ""all the way through to any time that there is an allegation that he had sexual intercourse with her"" (T 7:44-50), to the extent that an absence of sexual experience can be considered an event (T 8:45-46).

Consideration

45As the Crown observed, s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act was introduced to limit the circumstances in which complainants in sexual assault cases have to endure having what might otherwise be personal and sensitive matters being made public knowledge: R v White (1989) 18 NSWLR 332 at 340. Accordingly, unless an exception to s 293 exists, evidence as to the complainant's sexual experience or lack thereof is inadmissible and there is no residual discretion in the trial judge to allow the admission of the evidence: R v M (1993) 67 A Crim R 549; Taylor v R [2009] NSWCCA 180 at [47]; R v GEH [2012] NSWCCA 150 at [60].

46In Spratt v DPP [2010] NSWSC 355, the Court found that s 293 operated to render inadmissible a statement by a complainant that she was a virgin. In that case, Hidden J observed:

""Clearly, this material conveys that at the time of the alleged offences she was a virgin and that her sexual experience was limited to that which she described in her third statement. It would be evidence of sexual experience or the lack of it, coming within the terms of s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act."" (at [10])

47The exception created by s 293(4) applies where the complainant's sexual experience is so intrinsically involved, both temporally and factually, in the circumstances of the offence that to exclude that evidence would lead to an unfair distortion of the facts. The High Court considered this matter in Gregory v R (1983) 151 CLR 566 at 571:

""The statement that evidence that the complainant on a charge of rape consented to sexual intercourse with a man other than the accused is not relevant to the question whether she consented to intercourse with the accused, although correct in most cases, is not universally true. Usually, evidence as to the sexual experience of the complainant with other men could, at most, go to her credit, and if she has been cross-examined on the subject her answers must be accepted, in accordance with the general principle that a party may not impeach the credit of his opponent's witness by calling witnesses to contradict him or her on irrelevant matters. In some cases, however, the other acts of consensual intercourse may be so closely connected with the alleged rape, either in time and place, or by other circumstances, that evidence as to those other acts may be relevant to the issues at the trial; in those circumstances the evidence may not go solely to credit but may be probative of the fact that the complainant consented to have intercourse with the accused, or of the fact that the accused believed that the complainant was consenting. If evidence of this kind is relevant to an issue in the case, and not merely to credit, there is no rule of law that excludes it. The submission that there is some special rule of exclusion applicable to evidence of this kind is misconceived; the evidence of other sexual experience is excluded because, and only when, it is logically irrelevant to a fact in issue."" (Emphasis added)

48The two limbs to s 293(4)(a) are discussed later in this judgment.

49The Crown submitted that relevance in this sense had not been demonstrated, by reason of the appellant having to establish in accordance with s 293(4) that the particular ""event"" (being the complainant's statement to KG) formed part of a set of connected circumstances ""in which the sexual offence was committed"". Although there had been no conclusive judicial pronouncement on the parameters of the ""temporal requirement"" under s 293(4), the Crown noted that in previous cases such a requirement had been limited to a matter of hours within the alleged offence occurring: R v Morgan (1993) 30 NSWLR 543; Clark v R [2008] NSWCCA 122. 

50In BG v R [2010] NSWCCA 301, James J (with whom Hislop and Price JJ agreed) found that events occurring about 18 months after the alleged offence could not properly be regarded as having happened ""at or about the time"" of the alleged offences:

""It is not possible, in my opinion, to regard matters occurring at any time within a period of a number of years as having occurred ""at or about the time"" of the alleged offences. Nor could the matters be said to have formed part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged offences by the appellant were committed. The only real connection was the involvement of the complainant in all of the matters and in the appellant's alleged offences."" (at [82]-[83])

51More recently, in Doyle v R [2014] NSWCCA 4 Bathurst CJ (with whom Price and Campbell JJ agreed) held that:

""For the exception to the prohibition in s 293(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act contained in s 293(4)(a) to apply, both limbs of the subsection must be satisfied...it does not seem to me that the sexual activity alleged against Mr Bonica took place at or about the time of the commission of the offences alleged by DL against the appellant.

...

I do not think the fact that the statement could be used in some way to test the credit of DL affects the position. Two alternatives were suggested by the appellant. He suggested that if the statement were true it would suggest that DL was transferring his anger against Mr Bonica to the appellant. Alternatively, if it were false, it could demonstrate that DL had a predilection for making false complaints. Either way the relevant event itself, being the alleged assault by Mr Bonica, did not form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed. Although the complaint against Mr Bonica might go to the credit of DL, it was not so connected to the commission of the offences alleged that it bore on the objective likelihood of their commission: see GEH v R supra at [81]-[82]."" (at [235]-[237])

52I have noted above Mr Nicholson's submission that cross-examination of the complainant on her statement to KG in which she declared that she was a virgin should have been permitted on the basis that the statement was said to have been inconsistent with her evidence: Appellant's Written Submissions at p 8; T 7-8, 29 April 2014. 

53For the exception to the prohibition in s 293(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, contained in s 293(4), to apply, both limbs of that sub-section must be satisfied: see Doyle v R [2014] NSWCCA 4 at [235].

54Before discussing the possible application of the latter provisions, I will address the purpose or object Mr Nicholson contended would have been served in cross-examining the complainant on her alleged 1990 statement to KG.

55Mr Nicholson, as I understood his oral submissions, contended that the purpose of cross-examining the complainant on her statement was that it would go to the issue of whether the appellant committed the offences involving sexual intercourse with the complainant, they being the subject of counts 8, 9, 10 and 11. In other words, the complainant could be cross-examined to establish that before 1990 she had not previously had sexual intercourse in line with her statement to KG in 1990.

56If leave had been granted to cross-examine the complainant on her statement, it would, in my assessment, having regard to her first written statement to police, be reasonable to assume that she would have given the same account as she volunteered in that statement, namely, that although she made the statement in question to KG, she had lied to him, that is to say, that the statement as to her virginity was a lie. If the jury accepted her in saying it was a lie, the evidence would have no bearing upon a fact in issue in the trial. For the jury to have concluded that what she told KG was the truth, the jury would have had to have rejected her evidence in relation to the offences the subject of counts 8, 9, 10 and 11.

57However, the critical matter that would determine whether the exception contained in s 293(4) could apply is whether the appellant satisfied the two limbs of s 293(4)(a): first, the temporal element in s 293(4)(a)(i) and, second, the relationship or connection issue in s 293(4)(a)(ii) had been established (the relationship element) (the second limb). As to the first, incorporated within the phrase ""at or about the time of the alleged offences"", if the relevant ""event"" is the complainant's statement made in 1990 or 1991, then, on the basis of the caselaw to which I have earlier referred, the temporal element, in my opinion, would not be satisfied. As to the second, if the ""event"" were as Mr Nicholson argued, the fundamental difficulty facing the appellant's contention is the requirement that the event forms part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offences were committed.

58In relation to the temporal requirement in s 293(4)(a)(i), the Crown referred in its written submissions to decisions of this Court that support an approach that points to the need for a restricted operation to the temporal requirement. The Crown submitted:

""18. There has been no conclusive judicial pronouncement on the parameters of the phrase ""at or about the time of the alleged offences"" as it is used in s 293(4)(a)(i). 

19. Instances where s 293(4)(a)(i) has been considered have generally been limited to cases where the sexual activity has occurred within hours of the alleged offence: see for example R v Morgan (1993) 30 NSWLR 543 (1 hour, evidence admitted), Clark v R [2008] NSWCCA 122 (1 to 2 hours, evidence excluded because it did not satisfy s 293(4)(a)(ii)). 

20. In R v Henning the Court noted that evidence that the accused and the complainant had had sexual intercourse about twenty times over a period of nine years leading up to the offences would ""clearly"" not satisfy the temporal requirements of s 409B(3)(a) (the predecessor to s 293(4)(a)(i)). 

21. In R v Rahme [2004] NSWCCA 233 evidence of sexual experience that occurred weeks or possibly months before the offences was held not to satisfy the temporal requirement of s 293(4)(a)(i) by James and Hulme JJ, Sully J dissenting.""

59The provisions of s 293(4) were closely examined in GEH v R [2012] NSWCCA 150. In that case, the appellant had been convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 and 16 years, namely, 15 years (April and October 1992).

60The exclusion by the trial judge of evidence which might have disclosed or implied sexual activity (or lack thereof) on the part of the complainant on another occasion some 8 months later was challenged on appeal.

61In relation to the second limb of s 293(4)(a), Basten JA observed:

""11. The second and cumulative requirement of s 293(4) is that the relevant ""event"", which must be taken to include a non-event, must form part of ""a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed"" (emphasis added). The focus of the requirement is the circumstances in which the alleged offence was committed. However broadly one identifies that concept, it defies the ordinary meaning of the words to suggest that an assertion to a school friend about another matter months later constituted part of the circumstances of either assault alleged against the accused. In this regard, the difference between eight months and 15 months is of little significance.

12. A number of common characteristics do not render two events which occurred eight months apart to be a connected set of circumstances. On the hypothesis that neither event occurred, the characteristics only obtain significance if it were shown that on the latter occasion she lied, which was not proposed to be done. Nor, accepting that the temporal element involves a degree of imprecision, can the events be described as being at ""about"" the same time. 

13. Although the two limbs of the exception in paragraph (a) are differently worded and are cumulative, it may in some circumstances be helpful to read the temporal element (""at or about the time of"") and the relationship element (""form part of a connected set of circumstances"") together. Each phrase reflects elements of the other, particularly if the broader temporal element ""about the time of"" is the critical element. So much was implicit in the submissions for the appellant, which sought to identify certain characteristics (claim to be involved in a sexual relationship with a mature man in loco parentis in her home environment) said to be common to the elements of the alleged offence against the appellant and the inference to be drawn from the disputed assertion with respect to Mr Hastings. Although counsel for the accused was ambivalent as to whether the proffered evidence indicated a tendency to lie about such matters, the evidence could hardly have assisted the accused if that were not the forensic purpose."" (emphasis added)

62In GEH Basten JA also observed that an event that occurred (or did not occur) several months after the alleged offence could not properly be understood as within the sexual experience of the complainant at the time of either offence: at [14].

63The following matters, in my opinion, are relevant in determining the scope and application of the second limb contained in s 293(4)(a):

(1)The legislative purpose behind s 293(3), as earlier discussed.

(2)The fact that the exceptions to s 293(3), including in particular s 293(4), are expressed in restrictive terms. In other words, they are not broadly expressed.

(3)The provisions of s 293(4)(a)(ii) require consideration of:

The full circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence or offences was/were committed must be identified;

The relevant ""events"" are those that ""... form part of a connected set of circumstances"" in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed. Such ""events"" includes occurrences, and (on the approach of Basten JA in GEH) ""non-events"";

A ""connected"" set of circumstances includes a related set of circumstances, that is, that have a relationship or association with other circumstances.

64As Basten JA observed in GEH, supra, there must exist a particular association between an ""event"" (which must be taken to include a non-event) and the specified circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence(s) was/were committed.

65In paragraph [11] of his Honour's judgment in GEH (extracted in paragraph [61] above) it was observed that the focus of the requirement is the circumstance ""in which"" the alleged offence was committed. Whilst that may refer to a broad concept, in the present case the statement of the complainant to KG cannot, in my opinion, be considered as forming part of ""a connected set of circumstances in which ..."" the offences were committed.

66A ""connected"" set of circumstances in which the offence was committed does not, in my opinion, include a general statement as made to KG months or years after the offences were committed. The statement was not a ""connected"" circumstance within s 293(4)(a)(ii). It was no more than a representation made orally to a third person, KG, and additionally was one that was not made ""at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence"".

67The exception in s 293(4), as the Crown submitted, is directed at those cases as described by the High Court in Gregory v R (1983) 151 CLR 566 at 571 where the sexual activity or experience (or lack thereof) is so closely connected with the alleged offences in time and in place or other circumstances that evidence of those matters is relevant to the issues at trial. 

68As earlier noted, no reliance was placed by counsel for the appellant at trial upon the provisions of s 293(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act. Accordingly, no argument was presented as to the construction or application of those provisions and no contention made to the effect that they were engaged in the trial proceedings. The exception contained in s 293(4) was raised for the first time on this appeal, the application at trial having been based upon s 293(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act. 

69As a different basis was argued on appeal, leave is required under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules: Bin Sulaeman v R [2013] NSWCCA 283 at [121]-[122].

70Rule 4 provides as follows:

""No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.""

71The rule has the effect of imposing a duty on counsel to inform the trial judge of all points that arise from the summing up that could reasonably give rise to an appeal. Unless there is a good reason to the contrary, it will be inferred that decisions by counsel not to raise such matters with the trial judge are taken for sound forensic reasons: R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174 at [98]. Accordingly, the rule operates as a substantial obstacle to ""armchair appeals"": Bin Sulaeman v R [2013] NSWCCA 283 at [122].

72In Bin Sulaeman v R, RA Hulme J observed at [139]-[140]:

""A trial judge is entitled to, and counsel are obliged to provide, a proper foundation on which to base a ruling when asked to exercise a discretionary power. Objections to evidence are not at-large contentions concerning admissibility; they are vehicles for the raising of specific issues. This is a related concept to the principle that it is for the parties to define the issues at trial and that respect must be accorded to the decisions of trial counsel as to what evidence is to be the subject of objection, and the basis for any such objection.""

73In R v Poniris [2014] NSWCCA 100, Macfarlan JA (with whom Adamson and Bellew JJ agreed) considered the application of rule 4 and determined that where an objection to evidence is made by trial counsel on a particular basis, leave must be granted under rule 4 to challenge the admissibility of that evidence on appeal on a different basis.

74His Honour observed: 

""In the present case, the objection to the four exhibits at trial was based on relevance, while the objection advanced on appeal is based upon s 137, the former having now been conceded (as noted at [29] above). In my view the objection as to relevance cannot suffice to allow objections on any basis to be advanced on appeal without first obtaining leave. To hold otherwise would be contrary to the purpose of r 4 and the discouragement of 'armchair appeals' which that provision seeks to achieve (see Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62; 209 a Crim R at [169]-[170]; Flanagan v R [2013] NSWCCA 320 at [69]-[72]). It would also undermine basic principles of appellate review and the efficient administration of justice. The decision in Bin Sulaeman, Vickers and Shepherd support this conclusion."" (at [55]) (emphasis in original)

75Accordingly, leave to rely on an error to which no objection had been taken at trial will be granted only where the appellant can demonstrate that the error led to a miscarriage of justice. It appears to be generally accepted that the appellant must at least establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: R v Picken [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]-[21].

76In relation to the ground of appeal presently under consideration, the Crown submitted, correctly in my view, that the appellant failed to demonstrate the he lost a real chance of being acquitted and failed to discharge the onus he bears under rule 4, having regard to the following factors:


The complainant was a clear and cogent witness. 
The Crown case was supported by listening device evidence being a recorded conversation between the complainant and the appellant. 
The ""self-serving"" document written by the appellant notes of a conversation he had with the complainant - see [121] and supports the Crown case in that it details a sexual relationship between the appellant and the complainant. This document became Exhibit D. 
The appellant's evidence concerning the listening device conversation was completely unconvincing. 
The assertion that the appellant suffered erectile dysfunction was not supported by medical evidence and was contradicted by his claim in cross-examination (T 144-145) that he had no need for more sexual gratification than he already had with his wife.

77Furthermore, the Crown submitted that there may have been a legitimate forensic reason as to why defence counsel did not raise the matters the subject of this appeal during the trial: T 29:17-20. There was no ground of appeal raised in relation to incompetence of counsel: T 4:23-28, 29 April 2014.

78I do not consider, for the reasons stated above, that the appellant has established arguable error in relation to Ground 1 and accordingly no issue of a possible miscarriage of justice has been established in relation thereto.

79Accordingly, in all the circumstances I am of the opinion that leave under rule 4 should be refused. 

80I am accordingly of the opinion that Ground 1 should be dismissed. 

Ground 2

81Ground 2 seeks to raise two separate issues in each of which the error is asserted as a failure by the trial judge in relation to the granting of leave to the defence to cross-examine the complainant upon information divulged in a medical consultation with Dr White. The full terms of Ground 2(i) and (ii) are set out in paragraph [10] above.

82Before dealing with each of the matters raised it is desirable to provide the following matters by way of background. 

83The complainant made a statement to police dated 15 October 2005 in which she referred to the fact that she had received psychiatric counselling from a Dr Yvonne White in 2004 during which she disclosed abuse by the appellant (Exhibit VD2 at [46]). Following the consultation Dr White prepared a statement confirming the information provided by the complainant. In it Dr White referred to having made handwritten notes. Dr White's statement was not tendered but a portion of it was read onto the record: T 36, 17 September 2012. The appellant's solicitors had subpoenaed Dr White's notes but they had not been produced.

84On the first day of the trial counsel for the appellant sought production of Dr White's subpoenaed counselling notes, something that had been foreshadowed in a Notice dated 7 September 2012. 

85After the matter was raised, the trial judge expressed the view that the notes were a ""protected confidence"" for the purpose of s 296 of the Criminal Procedure Act and they were not compellable pursuant to ss 298 and 299D.

86The possibility of counsel for the appellant cross-examining the complainant on the counselling session was only raised during the course of argument by the trial judge and not by counsel for the appellant. The trial judge expressed the view that this would involve the disclosure of a protected confidence and it would require leave: T 42-43, 17 September 2012. At the end of the first hearing day the trial judge deferred consideration of ""Dr White's evidence"": T 49:40, 17 September 2012. On the following day, counsel for the appellant expressly abandoned the application: T 14:8-14, 18 September 2012.

87Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act is entitled ""Evidence in sexual offence proceedings"". Division 2 of that Part includes the provisions found in ss 295-306 in relation to what is termed ""Sexual assault communications privilege"". These sections establish a regime pursuant to which sexual assault communications privilege are safeguarded. They include provisions requiring the leave of the court in respect of a ""protected confidence"" which is defined in s 296(1) as meaning ""... a counselling communication that is made by, to or about a victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence.""

88Section 298(1) makes provision that, except with the leave of the court:

""... a person cannot seek to compel (whether by subpoena or any other procedure) any other person to produce a document recording a protected confidence in, or in connection with, any criminal proceedings.""

89Section 298(2) provides that, except with the leave of the court, a document recording a protected confidence cannot be produced in, or in connection with, any criminal proceedings. Section 298(3) similarly provides that except with the leave of the court evidence cannot be adduced in any criminal proceedings if it would disclose a protected confidence or the contents of a document recording a protected confidence. 

90In determining whether to grant leave under s 299D of the Act the court is required to be satisfied that the document or evidence has ""substantial probative value"": s 299D(1)(a). The court is additionally required to determine whether the public interest in preserving confidentiality of the communication is ""substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting"" the material: s 299D(1)(c).

91Finally, s 300 makes provision for the adducing of evidence with the consent of the confider. It provides that the consent is ineffective unless it is in writing: s 300(2)(a). That section expressly relates to the production or adducing in evidence of the privileged material: s 300(2)(b).

92I turn to the terms of Ground 2 of the application for leave to appeal in light of the fact, as earlier stated, that no application was actually made to the trial judge for leave to cross-examine the complainant about her counselling session with Dr White. In addition, on the question of leave, the application for production of Dr White's notes was abandoned by defence counsel on the second day of the trial and no oral application for leave to cross-examine the complainant on that material was made.

93The Crown's written submissions addressed the fact of the application for the doctor's notes having been abandoned and the failure by counsel for the appellant to make an application for a ruling on whether leave should be granted to cross-examine the complainant about the counselling session. These matters, it was submitted, plainly meant that rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules was of real significance in the determination of this ground of appeal: Crown Written Submissions at [38]. The Crown further submitted:

""[39] Turning to the question of whether a miscarriage of justice has flowed from the trial the judge's failure to grant leave to an application that wasn't made, the respondent submits that had consideration been given to the requirements of s 299D on such an application, leave would not have been granted.""

94At the hearing in this Court, Mr Nicholson's attention was drawn to a problem with Ground 2 as formulated. It was expressed in terms of the trial judge failing to consider and grant leave to the defence to cross-examine when no application for such leave had been made: T 11:40-50, 29 April 2014.

95Notwithstanding, Mr Nicholson in his oral submissions stated that he did not intend to amend the grounds (that is, Ground 2(i) and (ii)): T 13:41, 29 April 2014.

96Before considering the question of the grant of leave required under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules in relation to Grounds 2(i) and (ii) I set out below the competing submissions relevant to the question as to whether, had an application been made to the trial judge, it would or would not have been granted.

Appellant's Submissions

97The appellant submitted that the probative value of the material in Dr White's notes was substantial. The defence case thesis was that the allegations made by the complainant and referred to during the ""pretext"" conversation related to the events where the complainant allegedly made advances towards the appellant after attaining the age of 16.

98The appellant additionally relied upon what was said to have been an ambivalence, or lack of definiteness in terms of the complaint made by the complainant to Dr White, in particular, that she ""thought"" she had been sexually molested. It was noted the complainant later told a forum that ""I believe I was sexually assaulted"", before later stating that she was sexually assaulted. Such ambivalence, it was submitted, gave the evidence significant probative value: Appellant's Written Submissions at p 14.

99It was additionally argued that by making a police statement which stated the complainant would be prepared to give the evidence contained in that statement in court, she had consented to giving the evidence regarding her complaint to Dr White within the meaning of s 300 of the Criminal Procedure Act, and that this should have been taken into account when determining whether to grant leave to admit a protected confidence: s 299D(2). Furthermore, it was argued that the public interest in allowing the evidence, namely the ""unwarranted convictions of the appellant"", was not substantially outweighed by the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of the communication: Appellant's Written Submissions at p 14.

100The appellant also submitted that ""absent evidence of first complaint, supported by the evidence of 'virginity' the jury's acceptance of context evidence was more easily accomplished by the prosecution than should have been the case"": Appellant's Written Submissions at p 14. Further: 

""The complainant had already revealed the portion of the protected confidence that she had made - and her reaction to the questions raised by Dr White. Her reaction to those remarks is arguably not 'protected' and part of the probative value of the ambivalence sought to be relied upon. With respect his Honour did not give sufficient weight to those factors when giving the indication to defence counsel referred to above."" (Appellant's Written Submissions at p 15)

The Crown Submissions

101The Crown observed that in the defence notice dated 7 September 2012, which raised the issue concerning Dr White's notes, no reference was made in it to leave being sought to cross-examine the complainant about her counselling session with Dr White: Crown's Written Submissions at [33]. Additionally, that:

""...no application was ever made for leave to cross-examine the complainant about her counselling session with Dr White. The notice was...an application abandoned by defence counsel on the second day of the trial. And no oral application for leave to cross-examine the complainant on this material was made."" (at [37])

102The Crown also noted that the trial judge expressed the view that Dr White's notes were a protected confidence, and that accordingly, the defence would require leave to cross-examine the complainant on the counselling session. His Honour deferred consideration of Dr White's evidence. The following day, 18 September 2012, it was noted in the Crown's submissions that the defence seemingly abandoned the application:

""LOOMES: Your Honour, before I distract you, could I just tell you that we've - either in your presence or out of it resolved quite a lot of things, for example with the Dr White material, we understand that [the complainant] is maintaining her claim on privilege and our understanding of the legislation or on discussing it with the Crown is that that's pretty much an end to it and given the ruling that was made yesterday about the admissibility of what happened with Dr White that's the end of the matter as far as we're concerned at this stage."" (T 14:8-14)

103As a result, the Crown submitted that rule 4 applies, as the trial judge was never asked to rule on whether leave should be granted to cross-examine the complainant in respect of her sessions with Dr White.

104The Crown argued that the appellant's submission regarding the significant probative value of the evidence by reference to the ""ambivalence"" submission should be rejected. The complainant was extensively cross-examined regarding her failure to complain earlier, and in respect of whether she ""thought"" or ""believed"" she had been molested, she responded forcefully that she ""knew"" she had been sexually assaulted: T 49:40, 18 September 2012. Accordingly, it was submitted that further cross-examination on the complaint in the terms expressed to Dr White would not have significant probative value. The disclosure to Dr White was consistent with the later complaint and the complainant's evidence at trial: at [42]. Further, the statements to Dr White were very close in time to the virtually identical statements the complainant made at the forum, and in this respect, ""it certainly couldn't be said to have substantial probative value, given that there was another very similar piece of evidence before the jury"": T 25:36-40, 29 April 2014. Therefore, it was not even open for the trial judge to progress to considering whether the public interest would be outweighed by the admission of the evidence: T 26:2-5.

105It was additionally submitted that there was nothing in the disclosure to Dr White that warranted a conclusion that the public interest was substantially outweighed by the admission of the evidence, as required by s 299D(1)(c).

106As to the contention that the complainant had consented to the disclosure of the protected confidence (as a result of referring to the consultation in the police statements), the Crown referred to this Court's judgment in NAR v PPC1 [2013] NSWCCA 25 in which it was held that an effective consent in accordance with s 300 must be in writing and it must expressly relate to the production of a document or the adducing of evidence:

""51. The evidentiary basis for the suggestion that the complainant provided her consent is said to be a paragraph in her second statement stating: ""I give police permission to access and copy all of my medical records"".

52. The question of what obligation would be imposed on the police if they were to receive copies of documents recording protected confidences is a large one. It is neither necessary nor appropriate to determine it on this application. For present purposes, all that need be noted is that this form of ""consent"" is not one that satisfies s 300(2)(b). Such a consent must expressly relate to material that is privileged under Division 2 of Part 5. In this case the complainant only agreed to disclose her ""medical records"" which are not necessarily the same as documents privileged under Division 2 of Part 5. 

53. Further to satisfy s 300(2) any such consent must expressly relate to the ""production of a document or adducing of evidence"". This requires, inter alia, the provision of an express written consent to the production of documents at least to, and most probably via, the Court, or the adducing of the documents in evidence. The critical aspect of such a consent is that it is an agreement for both parties to view the material. It is not sufficient that, at the investigative stage, the complainant may have agreed to their production to and copying by only the prosecution or some other entity or organisation such as the police. 

54. Further I note that no argument to this effect was raised before the trial judge.""

107It was additionally noted that Part 5 Div 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act does not include waiver provisions. 

Consideration

108I accept the Crown submission that had leave been sought, leave would not have been granted. Cross-examination of the complainant as to her use of the word ""thought"" or other ""ambivalence"" in her complaint would not have yielded evidence of substantial probative value such as to substantially outweigh the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the protected confidence: at [46]. Further, as no application was made to cross-examine the complainant in this respect, rule 4 applies and leave should be refused. 

109It is clear that the complainant's discussions with Dr White were protected confidences within the meaning of s 296 of the Act, they being communications made in confidence to a psychiatrist by a victim of a sexual offence assault.

110The argument advanced on behalf of the appellant that the complainant's statement to police constituted a ""consent"" for the purposes of s 300 of the Criminal Procedure Act, in my opinion, must fail. An effective consent is one given in accordance with s 300, that is to say, in writing and expressly relating to the production of a document or the adducing of evidence: NAR v PPC 1 [2013] NSWCCA 25 at [52].

111I do not consider that ground 2 raises any point of merit. Leave under rule 4 in my opinion should be refused. Accordingly, Ground 2 should be dismissed.

Ground 3

112During the trial the Crown was permitted to lead ""context"" evidence of continuous sexual contact at five locations in circumstances where the complainant was always a willing, and often initiating party. 

113The Crown was also permitted to introduce into evidence a sound recording taken under police supervision from a listening device of a 40 minute ""pretext"" conversation between the appellant and the complainant, the complainant then being over 30 years of age. The ""pretext"" as provided by the complainant to the appellant was that she wanted to talk to him about past sexual contacts with a view to establishing whether it would be safe for her to visit the appellant in the company of her four young children. 

114The trial judge described the contents of the pretext conversation as follows:

""The conversation shows that the complainant attended uninvited at the address of her stepfather and mother and that she then engaged in a conversation with the accused. The initial part of that conversation deals with completely unrelated matters or family matters and/or general conversation. But at some point during the interview the complainant commenced to make a number of allegations and to speak to the accused about those allegations. The accused from time to time in fact told her that he would not continue if she did not stop and listen and allow him to have his say and at the end he in fact terminated the conversation. There are no threats contained in the conversation from either side. The conversation appeared to be reasonably cordial. It certainly was not abusive and there is nothing to indicate to the contrary and everything to indicate that in fact the conversation was a conversation that this accused engaged in voluntarily."" (T 3-4, 19 September 2012)

115This ground of appeal relates to his Honour allegedly erring in failing to:

(1)Warn the jury that the conversation could not be used as tendency evidence;

(2)Link all other sexual conduct references covered in the pretext conversation to context evidence, excluding the ""frankfurt"" episode, and that the jury had no reason to regard his directions in respect of context evidence as applying to historical sexual matters referenced in the conversation; and

(3)The pretext conversation was open to the jury to be used in an impermissible way, namely, as tendency evidence thereby exposing the accused to the impermissible use of evidence and thus tainting his trial.

116Parts of this conversation were admitted as Exhibit C on 19 September 2012 after the trial judge found the evidence had significant probative value that substantially outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice: p 4 of his Honour's judgment, 19 September 2012. The trial judge observed that:

""Clearly it would be for the jury to determine whether they accept that the document contains admissions or whether anything said by the defence in terms of any explanation for the things that are recorded as being said by the accused will ultimately be a matter for the jury. It will be for the jury to determine whether there is a direct admission, some of the answers are capable of that. It will be for the jury to determine whether there are implied admissions and the jury will be instructed in relation to the need for caution in drawing inferences and the fact that an inference can only be drawn it if is the only reasonable or rational inference."" (p 3)

117His Honour then stated that the jury would be given directions in relation to use of the evidence: p 4 of his Honour's judgment, 19 September 2012.

118Part of the recording was played to the jury during the trial. 

119As the complainant's cross-examination had concluded prior to the admission of Exhibit C, the Crown was granted leave on 19 September 2012 to re-open the complainant's examination in chief.

120On the morning of 20 September 2012, before the Court resumed hearing the complainant's evidence, the trial judge of his own motion gave further directions to the jury regarding the use of the pretext conversation in the following terms:

""HIS HONOUR: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Just before we resume with the evidence of [the complainant], I just wanted to say a couple of things in relation to the conversation that you heard yesterday. Obviously it's a matter for you to make of that conversation what you will in terms of whether you regard it as in any way supporting the Crown case, but if you feel that there is perhaps anything expressed within that which might, for instance, indicate potentially say a certain chauvinistic attitude, then the reality is you shouldn't let any conclusion you reach in regard to that influence the way you decide this case. In other words, it's neither here nor there whether a person who is the accused is chauvinistic or not chauvinistic.

The reality is the question here is whether the Crown has proved the essential elements of each of the charges, not whether the Crown has proved that a person has a particular mindset, for instance. So it is important that you understand that you not act in any prejudicial way. The reality is if someone for instance is a chauvinist they can be guilty or not guilty of an allegation. The fact that they are a chauvinist does not of itself prove that they are guilty of what is alleged against them. Now, I'm not necessarily saying that you would reach such a conclusion in terms of chauvinism. I am just saying that because there is a potential there for that, so far as I could see, I think it's important that you understand from the beginning the way in which you should use that conversation, and the way in which you should not use any assessment as to the accused in that area."" (T 2:3-25, 20 September 2012)

121In cross-examination the appellant said that he believed the focus of that conversation was re-establishing a relationship between the complainant and her mother. He maintained that all he could recall were the three occasions of inappropriate behaviour between himself and the complainant: T 122, 21 September 2012. The appellant's notes in respect of this conversation were admitted as Exhibit D during the trial. 

122Following the close of the defence case, defence counsel raised an issue in relation to the potential use of the pretext conversation. Mr Loomes noted that the Crown did not open on the listening device, and proceeded to cite Zoneff v R (2000) 200 CLR 234 and Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193 as authorities for the proposition that special directions must be given if there is a suggestion that lies establish a consciousness of guilt. The trial judge indicated that he ""was waiting to see what the Crown does with lies"": T 210:8-30, 24 September 2012. The Crown Prosecutor then stated that ""...the earlier rationale would be that the Crown is relying on just that it goes to credibility"". Further, that the Crown would be:

""...asking the jury to consider the context of the conversations, what was actually said, and ultimately whether they believe that he understood what was being referred to during the course of that conversation, and then ultimately it will be a matter for them whether his reaction during the course of that conversation is consistent with a man who has been told or had certain allegations put to him."" (T 211:14-19, 24 September 2012)

123In closing addresses, the Crown's submission in respect of the pretext conversation was put as follows:

""You might think that it was being made very plain to [the appellant] that this was what [the complainant] was talking about on that occasion on 23 September 2008.

And the reason that we went through that, painstakingly you might think, is because you will have to determine, that whether having gone through that process and watched the process that [the appellant] went through in cross-examination, did he understand what was being suggested to him plainly by [the complainant] during the course of that listening device conversation. Not only did he understand it but were these matters that would be in his personal knowledge, was she talking about something that only he could've known about. Well given that he was the person she was making the allegations against, well it did concern him.

If you're of the view that he did understand, that he did know what she was talking about, because of the way that she explained why she was there, at his house, why she was concerned about her little girls having dealings with him, on your understanding and your knowledge of human nature, do you think he reacted as someone who was innocent would. It's a matter for you. Look at the responses he makes.

What you're effectively being asked to do is to make an assessment of, it sounds very high noble, of human behaviour. Here you have two people, a man as he would say, being falsely accused of something, by his step-daughter. You as the jury will assess that conversation in that context and it's open to you, given your commonsense, your personal knowledge, having seen and heard the interaction in court, you may think that there has been a failure on his part to proclaim his innocence. You may think he didn't proclaim innocence, that that doesn't make him guilty, I'm not saying that, but it is something you may think, is inconsistent with someone who is innocent. You might think, that sounds like a typical lawyer talking. I will try and make it more simple.

Your worldly experience, given the scenario that you now understand to be the situation, having heard what was said by [the complainant], having heard the responses from the accused, do you believe that he understood what was being put to him. Did he appear to understand what the allegations were. If you think that he did understand those allegations, he did understand the nature of the allegations, was his behaviour or his responses consistent with someone who was protesting his innocence or not.

It's a matter for you as a jury whether you believe those inferences can be drawn. I am not able to suggest one way or the other, it's a matter for you. Look at the conversation, you look at the reaction."" (T 9:8-50, 24 September 2012)

124The appellant submitted that only one indicted offence was capable of being identified in the course of the pretext conversation, namely, the ""frankfurt"" incident, in the context of the complainant's ""first time"" with the appellant. However, it is argued that ""there is insufficient evidence in it to identify with certainty that it related to an episode of intercourse"", although both parties are agreed there was only ever one allegation against the appellant involving a frankfurt: Appellant's Written Submissions at p 21. The appellant also raised concerns that the recorded conversation did not constitute sworn evidence: p 23.

125Accordingly, the appellant submitted that the Crown's address in respect of the appellant's ""innocence"" was not a legitimate use that could be made of the pretext conversation. Further, it was submitted that it stood contrary to a direction given by the trial judge in relation to context evidence, namely, that context evidence was not to be substituted for evidence of the specific facts required to be found before guilt of an offence would follow: Appellant's Written Submissions at pp 18-19. This also had the effect of reversing the onus of proof: p 21. Accordingly:

""Regardless of how adverse the accused's reaction to the matters raised by the complainant could be described, it is impossible to see, how they could be described as - inconsistent with innocence of Counts, 3 or 4, or 5, or 6, or 8, or 9, or 10, or 11 - each of which had to be considered separately in respect of the essential elements of each. The accused's conduct during the course of the 'pretext' conversation cannot be analogous to a conscientiousness of guilt situation in respect of the various indicted charges as may be frequently the case when prosecution are relying in the deliberate telling of lies - usually in respect of a single episode of criminal conduct."" (p 21)

126Although there were no admissions as to the charged offences, Mr Nicholson acknowledged during the hearing of the appeal that the conversation ""contained admissions of the context material"": T 15:1-3, 29 April 2014. Mr Nicholson also conceded that on the context evidence it was open for the jury to conclude that it was speaking of a sexual relationship: T 19:4-7.

127However, in the course of summing up the trial judge reminded the jury ""there are no confessions in that conversation"", but that it could go towards whether the appellant was a witness of truth: T 41. 

128In the course of summing up the trial judge also gave directions to the jury in relation to the drawing of inferences generally (T 14-15) and lies and credibility (T 16-19). The trial judge noted: ""So if you conclude that the accused did lie, has lied, then that is a matter that would go to his credibility or his believability, can you believe him, does he have any credit?"": T 17. His Honour further stated:

""It is for you to make up your own mind about whether the accused has told lies and if he has whether he was doing so deliberately. Essentially that is a bit of double talk because the lie needs to be deliberate so it has to be something that is said that is not accurate and it is said in order to deceive, that is what makes it a lie, so it is a deliberate lie. It is for you to decide what significance any suggested lie or lies has in relation to the issues in the case but I should give you this warning, do not follow the process of reasoning that because a person is shown to have told a lie about something that that of itself is evidence that he is guilty. In other words it is not good enough for the Crown to prove that someone lied and therefore say well we proved he lies though so therefore that proves that he is guilty, it does not automatically flow."" (Summing Up, at T 18)

129The appellant additionally submitted that no attempt was made by the trial judge to identify the pretext conversation as involving context material where it made reference to sexual matters, save and except when the complainant referred to the ""frankfurt incident"": T 19. 

130The appellant noted that the pretext relied upon by the complainant for having the recorded conversation with the accused was her apparent belief that the appellant has a potential propensity to sexually misbehave with her children. During the conversation, the complainant said: ""And one thing I want is to make sure that the thing that happened with me and you does not happen with my kids"": Voir Dire Ex 6 at p 10. Mr Nicholson submitted that this raises an apprehension of propensity (T 15:50) which was subsequently endorsed by the Crown (T 16:12-14). However, at no point in the conversation did the complainant in fact suggest that the appellant ever did anything to her children or any other children. 

131The pretext was raised in the Crown address in the following terms:

""If you're of the view that he did understand, that he did know what she was taking about, because of the way that she explained why she was there, at his house, why she was concerned about her little girls having dealings with him, on your understanding and your knowledge of human nature, do you think he reacted as someone who was innocent would. It's a matter for you. Look at the responses he makes"" (T 9:21-26, 24 September 2012)

""...she's concerned about their safety. That's why she brings these allegations."" (T 11:9-13, 24 September 2012) 

132It was also addressed in his Honour's summing up:

""The reason [the complainant] may then have the conversation is quite a legitimate one, you might think that she might have been concerned about her children and their relationship leaving him [sic] with the father, she had the two young girls and commonsense would tell you that it might have been a motivation for her to want to do something about that in terms of ensuring their safety."" (Summing Up, T 42)

133Additionally, in the course summing up, his Honour explained the relevance of context evidence (T 33) and gave a direction in respect of such evidence:

""It is important that I explain to you the relevance of the evidence of these other acts. It was admitted or the evidence of those acts were admitted for the purpose of placing the complainant's evidence of the particular acts relied on for these eleven counts, into what the Crown says is a realistic context, so that is the purpose, otherwise you might wonder about the likelihood of apparently isolated acts occurring suddenly and without any apparent reason. If a complainant gave evidence of isolated acts of sexual misconduct, you would be entitled to think it was very odd for them or for there to be such isolated acts between these persons. If you had not heard about the evidence of the other acts, you may have thought that the complainant's evidence was less credible in that every now and again once every six months alleging something was done, it does not have the context of well this is happening regularly and I am just pulling out eleven that I can specify.

So if the other acts of it the particular acts charged are placed into a wider context involving the other acts, that is a context of an ongoing history, then the curious feature of apparently isolated acts would disappear, it is for that reason the law permits a wider sexual history to be provided, it is to avoid artificiality or unreality in the presentation of the evidence. For one or two incidents to be artificially isolated and selected and for a witness to be confined to them, could make it very difficult for her to proceed intelligently with her evidence. To pick out, for example, two incidents separated by lengthy periods could leave you with a very strange and unrealistic account and make it very difficult for her to answer questions, therefore it is open to the Crown to lead evidence of other acts of a sexual nature between the accused and the complainant. 

However I must give you some important warnings in relation to the evidence of other acts. (1) you must not use this evidence of other acts as establishing a tendency on the part of the accused to commit offences of the other type charged. (2) you must not substitute the evidence of the other acts for the evidence of the specific offences in the indictment."" (Summing Up, at T 33-34) (emphasis added)

134The trial judge further noted that:

""You must not reason that because the accused may have done something wrong to the complainant on another or other occasions, that he must have done so on the occasions on the indictment. So the only relevance is a context relevance, it puts it in context."" (Summing Up, at T 35)

135The appellant further submitted that the evidence as to the pretext of the conversation, namely, concerns for the safety of the complainant's children, is prohibited by s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995. The jury may very reasonably have come to a view that the pretext evidence was unrelated to the context evidence: Appellant's Written Submissions at p 23. Further, that:

""Neither the Crown, nor his Honour posed any question to the complainant as to whether she was sincere in the pretext she was relying upon - because such a question would have raised an inadmissible matter, namely tendency (and opinion), yet both relied upon her claimed pretext as being a finding of fact readily open to the jury to make."" (p 24)

136Mr Nicholson submitted that the jury was not made aware by the trial judge or either counsel that the transcript of the conversation was not a sworn document, that it was a pretext, and that the pretext did not necessarily need to be a statement of fact: T 16:28-33, 29 April 2014.

137However, defence counsel did not draw to his Honour's attention the matters covered under this ground of appeal. Although he objected to the tendering of the pretext conversation, the nature of the pretext and its potential harm were not raised. Accordingly, the Crown submits that rule 4 applies and leave must be sought. This was not disputed by Mr Nicholson: T 13:50, 29 April 2014.

138On 20 September 2012 the trial judge gave a context direction:

""Now, there are a couple of things that you can't do with it. The first is that you can't say, ""We're satisfied that he did those other acts, therefore we're going to find him guilty of all the counts on the indictment."" You have to go to each count and consider the evidence that is available on each count and determine whether that evidence convinces you, for instance, that he's guilty or not.

The fact that you accept other occasions took place only means that it gives it a context. You can't jump from, ""I accept that it happened on other occasions, therefore I'm going to convict him without any further consideration of the individual allegations in the indictment,"" and you think that's probably a matter of logic because you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to what she alleges in relation to each of the counts contained in the indictment. The second thing is that you can't use a tendency type argument. You can't say, ""Well, look, I accept these other acts, and that shows that he had a tendency to do these things, so therefore, because I find he had a tendency to do these things, I'm going to find him guilty of those other acts""."" (T 61:42-T 62:8, 20 September 2012)

139Following this, the trial judge asked if counsel sought any further direction. Defence counsel indicated no redirection was sought: T 62:23-25, 20 September 2012. As noted earlier, defence counsel also did not seek any redirection after the summing up.

140The Crown submitted that a miscarriage of justice will not be found in circumstances where a warning or direction would have been merely desirable rather than necessary: Crown's Written Submissions at [51].

141The Crown also contended that the trial judge did not give a propensity warning because there was no real danger of the jury misusing that evidence as propensity evidence, given the two effective context directions given during the trial and summing up (see [133] and [138] above) which were in conventional and appropriate terms: Crown's Written Submissions at [52]. Further, ""it would have been patently clear to [the jury] that none of the counts on the indictment were referred to specifically in the listening device conversation"": T 26:26-28, 29 April 2014.

142In respect of the pretext conversation, the Crown argued that at no point in the recorded conversation did the complainant suggest the appellant had done anything untoward to her children. Further, the Crown did not seek to use the pretext as evidence that the appellant had a broader tendency to sexually abuse children:

""The Crown submission in closing was that, contrary to his evidence at trial, the applicant well understood what the complainant was talking about (ie his sexual misconduct toward her when she was a child) because the complainant contextualised the conversation by telling him that she didn't want the same thing to happen to her children. This was not an invitation to the jury to use the conversation as evidence that the applicant had a particular tendency, or to substitute that evidence for evidence in support of the indicted counts."" (Crown's Written Submissions at [52])

143However, Mr Nicholson argued that ""it doesn't matter much what the Crown, what purpose it led it for, it's what capacity the evidence had to do damage"": T 19: 46-47, 29 April 2014.

144However, the Crown submitted ""there was no real risk of their using the pretext conversation impermissibly and no further warning was required"". Further, given the generality of the allegations of sexual misconduct in the recorded conversation, the general context direction was adequate to alert the jury to the danger of tendency reasoning. It would have been quite clear to the jury that the charged offences were required to be determined on the direct evidence, not on the context material: at [16]. At the hearing of this appeal, the Crown expressed this submission in the following terms:

""...the combination of the obviousness of the contextual quality of the conversation and the context direction that was given means that the jury were adequately directed as required by the circumstances of this particular case and that there was no appreciable or real risk that they would misuse that evidence."" (T 27:5-10, 29 April 2014)

145Finally, in respect of the trial judge's alleged failure to link references in the pretext conversation to context evidence, the Crown submitted that other than the ""frankfurt episode"", other references in the pretext conversation to sexual matters were in general terms and were properly available to be used by the jury as evidence of general admission (Rolfe v R [2007] NSWCCA 155 at [67]) and as consistent with the complainant's evidence and so supportive of her credibility. The Crown also noted that unlike in Christian v R [2012] NSWCCA 34, the appellant gave evidence about the conversation, in which he offered an explanation for his responses to the complainant's questions.

Consideration

146As noted earlier, defence counsel did not seek a redirection on the matters that are the subject of this ground. 

147A tendency warning will be required as a matter of law where there is a significant risk that the jury might embark on impermissible tendency reasoning having regard to the evidence placed before it and the arguments of counsel.

148In the present case, as noted above, the appellant's contention was that the complainant's conversation with the appellant in which she said that she wanted ""to make sure that the thing that happened with me and you does not happen with my kids"", could have given rise to impermissible tendency reasoning by the jury, namely, it may have misused that evidence as evidence that the appellant had a broader tendency to sexually abuse children. 

149Where a tendency warning is merely desirable, rather than necessary, a miscarriage of justice will not be found. In Toalepai v R [2009] NSWCCA 270, Howie J held:

""47 ...I do not believe that the law requires that such a [tendency] warning must be given whenever the evidence of the complainant suggests that sexual misconduct occurred on more occasions than those contained in the charges in the indictment. It may be desirable to give a direction such as that recommended in the Bench Book and set out above, but it is not mandatory in every case, regardless of how vague and general the evidence of other acts might be. 

48 Of course if there is anything said in the trial that might suggest a tendency on the part of the accused or the evidence is used in a way that might indicate a tendency, then a warning should be given. But if there is nothing in the evidence or its use by the Crown to indicate the real possibility of tendency reasoning on the part of the jury, then I do not believe that the Court is prevented from applying r 4 where there was a failure to request the warning. I am not convinced that in such a case a failure to give the warning results in a fundamental defect in the trial. 

49 In other words, in my opinion each case should be considered on its own facts and an assessment of whether a tendency warning was required as a matter of law in the particular circumstances of the case will depend upon whether there was a significant risk that the jury might have embarked on impermissible tendency reasoning having regard to the evidence placed before it and the arguments of counsel. I accept that one of the considerations in determining whether such a direction is warranted is that the complainant's evidence is unsupported by other evidence but I do not believe that this fact can be decisive.""

150At no point during the conversation did the complainant suggest that the appellant had done anything untoward to her children. During the course of summing up the trial judge referred to the complainant's concerns about the safety of her children, and that this might be a ""legitimate"" reason to have the conversation with the appellant (Summing Up at T 42).

151It is clear from the transcript that the Crown primarily sought to use the content of the conversation not to raise allegations of untoward actions against the complainant's children, but rather to demonstrate that the appellant knew what the complainant was taking about, and to subsequently use this on the issue of his credit. 

152In my opinion, there was no real possibility that the jury might have used the recorded conversation as manifesting a tendency of the appellant to sexually abuse children. Further, I am not satisfied that anything indicated the real possibility of tendency reasoning by the jury. 

153In any event, I consider that the warnings given by the trial judge during the trial and in the course of summing up, extracted at [133] and [138] above, as to the use of the conversation and evidence of other acts, were adequate and appropriate, and therefore do not give rise to a miscarriage of justice. In particular, I note his Honour specifically warned the jury in the course of summing up that ""you must not use this evidence of other acts as establishing a tendency on the part of the accused to commit offences of the other type charged"" (T 34). Although his Honour did not specifically refer to the pretext conversation in giving those warnings, this does not render the warnings and directions given by his Honour any less adequate or appropriate. Further, I do not accept as valid the appellant's argument that his Honour ""appears to endorse as a legitimate argument the use made of tendency by the prosecutor"": Appellant's Written Submissions at p 24.

154In all the circumstances, and having regard to defence counsel's failure to seek a redirection, I am of the opinion that leave under rule 4 should be refused. 

155I am also of the opinion that Ground 3 should be dismissed. 

Ground 4 

156In respect of Count 10, the trial judge directed the jury as follows:

""Then in relation to count 10 she recalled it because it was an incident on the bed and that he had a hand on each side of her as she was lying with her legs off the side of the bed, body on the bed and then he was pushing the bed, effectively meaning that she would be moving, her vagina would be moving on his penis and that she recalled that particular occasion by reason of the fact that she was then later on she had not showered, she was then later on with the person Matthew and some others and Matthew made the comment that she stunk or that someone stunk, I do not think he said she stunk but that someone stunk and she said well it was the sex smell still on me, I was embarrassed, I had not had a shower. So that is that she is able to remember that particular incident."" (Summing Up, T 39) (emphasis added)

157As observed in the written submissions for the appellant, on the Crown case Count 10 related to an offence that occurred at an address in Korora. The circumstances of the offence were described in the Crown's Summary of Trial in the following terms:

""While the complainant's mother was away from the family home the [appellant] and the complainant were in the [appellant's] bedroom. She was lying on her back across the bed with her bottom positioned towards the edge. Her legs were parted and the [appellant] inserted his penis into her vagina and bounced the bed which moved the complainant's body up and down. The complainant's mother arrived home and the complainant ran to her bedroom and pretended to be asleep. [See Crown submissions on sentence - written outline of facts relating to the various counts].""

158As Mr Nicholson properly conceded in his written submissions:

""The Crown in her address [T. 24/09/12 p 7/16-33] set out in clear detail its case against the appellant in respect of Count 10. No [complaint] can be made of the detail she gave the jury in respect of that count. 

Thus his Honour in his directions has telescoped two incident[s] together - one that occurred and was interrupted when her mother came home at night ... - the complainant fled to her own bedroom and pretended to be asleep; the other occurred at the same address, early in the morning on a school day morning, but while the mother was at the Take Away but there was no interruption reported. After the morning episode of intercourse the complainant left her house and thereafter attended school."" (Appellant's Written Submissions at p 26)

159The appellant submitted that in his directions, the trial judge in describing the offence, attached as part of the circumstances of that act of sexual intercourse, matters that are related to an uncharged allegation of sexual intercourse that occurred on another occasion and in different circumstances. Moreover, it was contended that error lies in his Honour directing the jury that the complainant was able to recall the events in relation to Count 10 as a result of the reference to an uncharged allegation and context matter (see emphasised words at [156] above): T 21:32-37, 29 April 2014.

160The uncharged allegation related to a complaint in relation to sexual intercourse that occurred on the morning of the comment being made about the complainant smelling, that is, a context matter. However, Count 10, on the Crown's case, related to sexual intercourse that occurred one evening, which was interrupted by the complainant's mother (see extracts from Crown's Summary of Trial, above). There was no allegation of interruption in respect of the morning allegation.

161The error, in the appellant's submission, is that the trial judge ""telescoped"" two incidents together. It was contended, ""that the jury were invited to consider a scenario of a charge that was a false scenario"": T 21:1-6, 29 April 2014.

162At the conclusion of the summing up the trial judge invited both counsel to raise any matter: Summing Up, T 49-50. Neither counsel raised any matter related to the misstating of the facts and circumstances of Count 10.

163However, Mr Nicholson's submission was that:

""...when a mistake as serious as this occurs if defence counsel hasn't picked it up, there's an obligation on the Crown to assist his Honour to avoid appealable error and if the Crown didn't either nudge defence counsel it would seem or jump up yourself and while I'm not often critical of Crowns it seems to me that that was an oversight that really should not have happened on the part of the Crown."" (T 21:25-30, 29 April 2014)

164The Crown noted that in the closing address the Crown set out this count accurately: Crown's Written Submissions at [59]. Moreover, the appellant did not make any complaint in respect of the Crown's address to the jury in respect of Count 10: Appellant's Written Submissions at p 26.

165Although the Crown conceded that the trial judge's directions included a misstatement of the evidence, it was the Crown's submission that it was not a matter that caused or would have caused a miscarriage of justice: T 27:25-30. The Crown submitted that when one views the trial judge's misstatement against the backdrop of the evidence as a whole, including the proper description of the evidence by the Crown, one could not conclude that there had been a miscarriage of justice: T 29:1-5. The different verdicts returned, it was contended, indicate that the jury were careful to scrutinise the Crown's case with care: T 27:30-31. 

166The Crown submitted that as no redirection was sought, rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. Mr Nicholson accepted that the rule applied (T 21:24-25) but submitted in that respect, ""all of those matters go to fundamental issues and go to the question of losing a real chance"": T 3-5, 29 April 2014. In this respect, the appellant relied upon this Court's judgment in Wong v R [2009] NSWCCA 101. 

Consideration

167In determining whether the trial judge's misdescription of the evidence concerning the factual circumstances of the offence the subject of Ground 4 occasioned a miscarriage of justice, it is necessary to undertake a realistic appraisal of the trial context in which the misdescription occurred.

168Firstly, the circumstances of the offence the subject of Count 10 distinguished it from other charged and uncharged acts. The particular distinguishing features of it are relevant to both the reliability of the complainant's evidence and the jury's assessment of her account.

169Secondly, the complainant's evidence in relation to Count 10 provided a detailed account of the offence, including in particular the fact that whilst the offence was taking place she heard the family car drive up the driveway, and that she ran to her bedroom as her mother arrived and pretended to be asleep: T 37-38, 18 September 2012.

170Thirdly, the Crown Prosecutor correctly summarised the evidence in relation to Count 10 at T 7, 24 September 2012. In describing the relevant events the Crown Prosecutor referred to ""the unusual feature of this particular offence"" and summarised the particular activities described by the complainant as having occurred along with the fact of her mother coming home earlier than expected and of the complainant running into her bedroom.

171Fourthly, I accept the Crown's submission to the effect that the complainant's account in relation to Count 10 was not shaken in cross-examination.

172Fifthly, the misdescription of events by the trial judge in relation to Count 10, rather than being seen in a vacuum, is to be evaluated for any significance it could have in terms of a possible miscarriage of justice, in light of the specific evidence the jury heard, the accurate Crown submissions made in relation to it and the fact that the particular verdicts entered by the jury support the conclusion that its members were discerning in analysing the evidence.

173I have concluded that the trial judge's misdescription was not sufficient to give rise to or constitute a miscarriage of justice. Leave should not, in my opinion, be granted under rule 4. Ground 4 should be dismissed.

Ground 5

174In respect of Count 11, the subject of appeal Ground 5, the trial judge directed the jury as follows:

""Then count 11 was the...Service Station on the bed, I mean there seemed to be some suggestion that there was no bed there, she was cross-examined about that but at the end of the day [the complainant's mother] said there was a bed there and [the complainant's mother] said it was a bed she had slept on so you know be it a storeroom, whatever may have been in there, it seems that there was a bed in there and the incident in relation to count 11 is recalled because it is something that occurred in that storeroom on that bed at the back of the...Service Station."" (Summing Up, T 39)

175On the previous day the Crown had set out the factual circumstances relied upon in respect of Count 11. Notwithstanding this, the appellant argued that, contrary to the trial judge's direction, there was nothing which distinguished this event from any other sexual intercourse event that may have taken place at the Service Station. There was no evidence that the sexual encounter relied upon by the Crown was the sole episode of sexual intercourse that occurred at the Service Station: Appellant's Written Submissions at p 27. The absence of any description was a pertinent matter in Mr Nicholson's submission: T 21:42-46, 29 April 2014. 

176However, there was no charge made in relation to any other sexual assault at the Service Station, other than Count 11. The complainant was only directed to that matter and was cross-examined only on that matter: T 22:16-17, 29 April 2014. No other evidence was given by the complainant about other sexual activities at the Service Station, and there was no suggestion in chief or in cross-examination that there were other acts of sexual intercourse that occurred at the Service Station: T 23:17-36, 29 April 2014.

177The appellant submitted that the trial judge had an obligation to ensure that the jury understood the facts and circumstances relied upon by the Crown to establish each specific individual charge in a multiple count indictment, particularly in relation to historical sexual assault charges and where evidence arising from context offences and pretext conversations establishes other uncharged sexual activity. 

178It was argued that in respect of the directions for Count 11 (as with Count 10), the trial judge failed to ensure the requisite understanding among the jury: Appellant's Written Submissions at p 26.

179The Crown in response emphasised that there was only one episode of penile-vaginal intercourse alleged to have occurred at the Service Station. Accordingly, it was submitted, the summing up was entirely adequate to remind the jury of the evidence on that count, and leave to appeal should be refused: Crown's Written Submissions at [61]-[63].

Consideration

180This ground is based upon a misconception, namely, that the evidence established that sexual intercourse between the complainant and the appellant took place at the Ampol Service Station, in the storeroom on more than one occasion: Appellant's Written Submissions at pp 26-27.

181The summing up was consistent with the Crown address on Count 11. There was, on the evidence, only one episode of penile vaginal intercourse at the Ampol Service Station. The summing up was a sufficient summation of the evidence in relation to Count 11. No redirection was sought in relation to it.

182I have concluded that leave to rely upon Ground 5 as a ground of appeal should be refused.

Conclusion and Orders

183I have concluded that each of the grounds relied upon is without merit. I accordingly propose an order that the appeal be dismissed.

184R A HULME J: I agree with Hall J.

185DAVIES J: I agree with Hall J.

		18 November 2014",2014-10-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2423470,R v Langi [2014] NSWDC 339,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing Fine Langi for a robbery in company. Robbery in company is a crime against s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Parliament regards it as a serious crime because it has fixed to it a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	In sentencing an offender, a judge needs to set out what happened to bring about the charge. The judge also needs to set out and take into account information personal to the offender. I will start with what happened.
	
	
	Mr Langi and his partner, Jade McKinley, were at a shopping centre in Mayfield on 19 November 2013. They are in a relationship and share a son, Connor. Mr Langi is 37 now; he was then 36. Ms McKinley was then 25.
	
	
	A woman named Ashley Irvine was sitting at a bus stop nearby. She was speaking on her mobile phone. Jade McKinley went up to Ms Irvine and said “Fuck you, you slut, you bitch. You fucking talking to me?” It appears that Ms McKinley thought that Ms Irvine was speaking to her, when in fact she was speaking on the mobile phone to somebody else. Apparently Ms Irvine had injured her wrist and was wearing a cast. She was also wearing some jewellery. Jade McKinley “grabbed the victim’s earrings and ripped them from her ears. McKinley continued to shout at the victim, who was apologising to McKinley, trying to calm her down.” (I am quoting from the agreed facts which became exhibit B in the sentence proceedings.)
	
	
	Ms McKinley went into a nearby shop and spoke to Mr Langi. She claimed that she had been assaulted by Ms Irvine. Mr Langi said that he would come out. They both went out together and they both went back towards Ms Irvine. The facts go on to say that “McKinley screamed at the victim ‘You fucking bitch. You fucking cunt.’” Mr Langi then joined in the abuse by saying “You’re fucking nothing.” They were both standing over and leaning over Ms Irvine. Not only that, Mr Langi was “holding down the victim, who was screaming”. Then Ms McKinley “ripped the victim’s necklaces from around her neck. The chain broke and two pendants fell to the ground. McKinley took the victim’s purse from the seat beside her and picked up the pendants from the ground.” Mr Langi “reached over and took the victim’s two mobile phones which the victim had tucked into the top of her dress.” They both then walked away, still yelling abuse at her.
	
	
	The value of the jewellery stolen has been estimated by Ms Irvine as four and a half thousand dollars. The two phones were about $700.
	
	
	Ms McKinley was arrested on 30 November 2013 and Mr Langi a couple of days later on 3 December 2013. They were both charged with robbery in company and I have had the benefit of the sentencing remarks of her Honour Judge Wilson SC, as her Honour then was, in sentencing Ms McKinley. I will return to that.
	
	
	I turn now to some matters personal to Mr Langi. He has a criminal record. It is a long one. Most of the offences were dealt with by the Local Court. They include offences of dishonesty as well as an assault and matters to do with apprehended violence orders. All his offending was as an adult. There are many traffic matters. There is a break enter and steal. The dishonesty offences include goods in custody, larceny and shoplifting. He has been in gaol before, mostly for traffic matters.
	
	
	It is important to note that at the time that he committed this offence, he was on a good behaviour bond. In other words, he had been released by another court into the community instead of being given a gaol sentence, on condition that he behave himself. He failed to do this and committed this crime instead. It is an aggravating factor which I am required to take into account.
	
	
	Ms R Suters of counsel represented Mr Langi. She called her client to give evidence last Thursday. He has been in custody at Bathurst for the last five months where he is employed as a sweeper. He enjoys the work. He gave evidence that he has a history of drug abuse. He has been using amphetamines since his early teenage years when he was introduced to the drugs by an older friend of the family. His amphetamine use includes methamphetamine, the drug commonly known as ice. He has also abused prescribed medication. He has been on the methadone program and was on the methadone program before being released from custody on a previous occasion. He has also been on the methadone program in the community.
	
	
	He and Ms McKinley’s son, Connor, is now six. He is being cared for by Family and Community Services.
	
	
	Ms Suters pointed out that Mr Langi had been out of custody for some three years or so between 2007 and 2011. She asked him what happened around 2011. There was an argument between him and Ms McKinley. Connor was taken away by the State authorities. That had a serious impact on Mr Langi’s stability and, as he said, he went downhill from there and started to use drugs again. He was taking drugs at the time that he committed this offence. He remains in contact with Connor by exchanging letters whilst he is in custody.
	
	
	Since being in custody Mr Langi has put on about 20 kilograms in weight because of his more healthy lifestyle in prison. It involves exercise and eating and he has not been using drugs in prison. This is borne out, as Ms Suters argues, by his record for misbehaviour in custody. He has transgressions over the years but none for this recent period. He has found that his employment as a sweeper and staying off drugs and his personal regime have brought a degree of stability for him on this occasion.
	
	
	He expressed regret and contrition for the crime that he committed and some understanding of the impact that it would have had on the victim. He wants to build a new life away from bad influences and re-establish contact with his son, Connor.
	
	
	Ms Suters, in her written and oral submissions, focused on two issues, parity and the length of the non-parole period. Judge Wilson SC sentenced Ms McKinley to a sentence of three years and 10 months. The non-parole period was two years and 10 months. Ms Suters points out that although her client played a less significant role in the offence than Ms McKinley, Mr Langi pleaded guilty at a much later stage than Ms McKinley. Mr Langi pleaded guilty only late in the week before the trial. As Ms Suters pointed out, it no doubt saved the witnesses and perhaps the witnesses having to prepare, but the plea was nevertheless very late. In addition, Mr Langi is older than the offender Ms McKinley. Both of them have similar criminal records, reflecting offences dealt with by the Local Court.
	
	
	Ms Suters said, both in her written and oral submissions, that there was not a marked disparity between the two offenders so far as sentencing is concerned. Mr Campbell, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, acknowledged the late plea and the involvement of Ms McKinley and the age difference. In my opinion there is little difference between the two offenders so far as a sentencing judge is concerned.
	
	
	The second aspect which Ms Suters dealt with was special circumstances for adjusting the non-parole period downwards. Normally a non‑parole period is 75% of the head sentence. A sentencing judge can adjust that figure downwards if the judge finds that there are special circumstances.
	
	
	Ms Suters argued that there were special circumstances in this particular case. First she pointed to the fact that her client has been in and out of custody regularly over the years, apart from two periods, one from 2004 to 2006 and the other from 2007 to 2011. In other words, her client has not had a lot of time in the community with an opportunity to stabilise his life in the community as distinct from being in custody. I think that there is a good deal of force in that submission. The second is that it is apparent that her client is making an effort whilst in prison to rehabilitate himself. That is obvious from the weight that he has put on, his regime of training and the fact that there are no institutional punishments which he has incurred this time. I accept that submission too, and in due course I am going to fix a non-parole period which will be about 60% of the head sentence.
	
	
	One last matter that both Ms Suters and Mr Campbell dealt with was the fact that in committing this offence, Mr Langi had breached a number of good behaviour bonds imposed under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	Three of them were imposed on 16 January 2012 for a common assault and for two offences of contravening a prohibition or restriction in an apprehended violence order. For each of those three offences, Mr Langi was given a good behaviour bond for two years. The good behaviour bond would have commenced on 16 January 2012 and would have expired on 15 January 2014. Ms Suters pointed out that I should take no action in respect of those three offences because the offending behaviour, and therefore breach of the bonds, occurred towards the very end of the period of two years. I propose to accept that submission.
	
	
	However, the fourth good behaviour bond was imposed on 24 May 2013, only a few months before the offence in this case. That was a six month good behaviour bond for possessing a restricted substance, which was a tablet. Although Mr Langi was also towards the end of the good behaviour bond in respect of that offence, it was a much shorter bond and had been imposed much more recently. In respect of that case, I propose to fix a sentence of one month imprisonment upon which the other sentence will be accumulated. In fact, what I will do is to indicate the two sentences that I would impose and then I will aggregate the two sentences.
	
	
	For reasons that I have given, I would regard an appropriate sentence for Mr Langi as being the same as the sentence imposed in respect of his co‑offender, Ms McKinley. I emphasise that, although she had a greater role, Mr Langi pleaded guilty much later. That sentence I have indicated of three years and 10 months takes into account the plea of guilty which he entered late, and it also takes into account the guideline judgment for sentencing in robbery cases given by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. Ms Suters, I might add, correctly conceded that I had no other choice than a sentence of custody.
	
	
	In respect of the breaches of three good behaviour bonds imposed on 16 January 2012, I would take no action.
	
	
	In respect of the breach of the good behaviour bond imposed in 2013, I would have fixed a one month sentence.
	
	
	In respect of the robbery in company that I am sentencing him for in this case, I would regard a sentence of three years and 10 months as appropriate. However, the non-parole period I would fix at two years and four months on the overall sentence.
	
	
	Accumulating, as I would do, the three years and 10 months onto one month, that would yield an overall sentence of three years and 11 months, or 47 months. In due course I will impose one aggregate sentence in respect of both crimes.
	
	
	Were I to fix the normal non-parole period envisaged by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the non-parole period would be two years and 11 months. Instead, I propose to fix a non-parole period of two years and four months.
	


HIS HONOUR:   I will make the orders now.


	
	I am satisfied that Mr Langi has failed to comply with the conditions of the three good behaviour bonds imposed on 16 January 2012 in the Newcastle Local Court. Under s 98(2)(a), I decide to take no action with respect to those failures.
	
	
	I am also satisfied that Mr Langi has failed to comply with the conditions of the good behaviour bond imposed by the Newcastle Local Court on 24 May 2013. Under s 98(2)(c), I revoke that good behaviour bond. I would have re-sentenced Mr Langi to one month imprisonment under s 99(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and I would have imposed a sentence of three years and 10 months, cumulative on that one month, in respect of the robbery in company.
	
	
	But in respect of both of those offences, instead of imposing separate sentences, I impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of three years and 11 months. That commenced on 3 December 2013, when Mr Langi went into custody, and it will expire on 2 November 2017. I fix a non-parole period of two years and four months which commenced on 3 December 2013 and will expire on 2 April 2016. The balance of the term is one year and seven months commencing 3 April 2016 and expiring on 2 November 2017.
	


HIS HONOUR: Now, Mr Campbell, Mr Bruce, take your time to check the mathematics. So, three years and 11 months aggregate sentence commencing 3/12/13, expiring 2/11/17; non-parole period two years and four months commencing 3/12/13, expiring 2/4/16; balance of the term, one year seven months, 3/4/16 to 2/11/17. Do you agree with the figures, mathematics, Mr Campbell, Mr Bruce?

BRUCE: Yes, your Honour.

CAMPBELL: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And I do not order release on parole because it is over three years. I am pretty sure I am right. Yes. The Parole Authority deals with it.

BRUCE: That’s so.

HIS HONOUR: All right. Now, Mr Langi, you have received the same sentence as Ms McKinley of three years and 10 months. I have also given you one month for one of the breaches of your bond. So, all in all, you have got three years and 11 months, do you understand? That commenced when you were arrested on 3 December last year, so you are nearly a year through your sentence. Your sentence will expire eventually on 2 November 2017. But the important consideration for you is your non-parole period. That also commenced when you were arrested on 3 December 2013 and your non‑parole period will expire on 2 April 2016. Now, I do not order your release on that date--

BRUCE: Would your Honour allow me to be excused, your Honour; in fact, because the parole period is less than three years--

HIS HONOUR: No, it is the overall sentence, three years.

BRUCE: I apologise, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I think I am right - section 51. Your parole period expires 2 April 2016, and then you have got after that one year and seven months of your sentence to go till the sentence finally ends on, as I said, 2 November 2017. The Parole Authority will consider your application for release on parole, hopefully favourably, because you have been doing very well so far. Do you understand that now?

OFFENDER: Yes I do.

HIS HONOUR: Okay. Do you have any questions? I am not saying you should, I am just checking.

OFFENDER: No.

HIS HONOUR: No. Good. All right, thanks, Mr Langi. Good luck.

OFFENDER: Thank you.

HIS HONOUR: I will give the exhibits back to my associate, and in due course I will - what has happened to the 166 certificate, of affray?

CAMPBELL: If your Honour will just dismiss that.


	
	All right, I dismiss the charge of affray.

2423576,Buggy v The Nominal Defendant [2014] NSWDC 224,"Judgment

Introduction

1The plaintiff by suffered injury in the course of avoiding a collision with a motor vehicle on Newport Road, Dora Creek in the state of New South Wales on 27 June 2010. As the motor vehicle could not be identified, she brings those proceedings against the Nominal Defendant.

The pleadings

2The circumstances in which the accident occurred, according to the statement of claim, were as follows. The plaintiff was riding an unregistered ""trail bike"" motorcycle (a Yamaha YZ250) along the roadway, travelling home after going for a ride in an ""off-road"" quarry used by trail bikes. At approximately 3:00pm on 27 June 2010, as she travelled along Newport Road, an unidentified motor vehicle pulled out of another street, causing her to lose control of her motorcycle and collide with the ""roadway/embankment"". 

3As the unknown vehicle sped away without stopping, the plaintiff commenced proceedings against the Nominal Defendant. The Nominal Defendant denied liability (s 81 notice issued on 11 February 2011) and has filed a defence denying that the accident occurred as alleged, denying negligence and pleading contributory negligence, and asserting that due inquiry and search has not been made in relation to the identity of the unidentified motor vehicle.

The evidence

7The plaintiff gave evidence of the circumstances of the collision, to which there were no other witnesses. Her mother gave evidence of the events following the plaintiff's return to her home, which the plaintiff managed to complete on her trail bike. The plaintiff's former boyfriend, Mr Isaac Delalande, also gave evidence. 

8The defendant called Mr Darryl Grant, a neighbour of the plaintiff, in relation to home care issues. The only other witness called for the defendant was the solicitor who prepared a draft statement for Mr Delalande which he subsequently refused to sign. The terms of that statement, as well as hospital notes referring to how the accident occurred, are substantially different to the account of the accident given by the plaintiff. 

9The plaintiff and her mother both gave evidence in reply to the evidence of Mr Delalande and Mr Grant.

10This hearing occupied three days in a busy circuit list. The parties did not order a transcript. I made notes of the evidence during the hearing. However, because of the significant differences between the plaintiff's evidence and the hospital notes, and a newly suggested explanation for this in the closing address of counsel for the plaintiff, I ordered a transcript and have compared my notes to it, in order to ensure the evidence is recorded as accurately as possible in my judgment. Where I am in any doubt as to the accuracy of my notes, I have given the plaintiff the benefit of that doubt.

11I shall first set out the evidence of the plaintiff in relation to the circumstances of the accident.

The plaintiff's account of the accident

12The plaintiff had owned what she called a ""dirt bike"" (or, on other occasions, a ""trail bike"") since either 2009 or 2010, when she bought a Yamaha trail bike (model YZ 250) from her brother. She told the court that, on the day in question, she had decided to go for a ride in a disused quarry about three kilometres from her home, where a track for trail bikes was available for use. This bike was not registered for road use, so that plaintiff and her boyfriend would be driven to the quarry by her mother, or by her boyfriend (Jason Delalande) in his car, with the bikes loaded in the back.

13On the day in question, the plaintiff decided to go for a ride without her boyfriend, and asked her mother to drive her to the quarry, on the basis that she would be picked up at 3.30 p.m. The plaintiff was driven to the quarry by her mother at approximately 2:00pm for her to ride her bike along the bike trail, with her mother returning home. 

14There were no other riders at the track on that day. The plaintiff rode her bike for about an hour but then, despite having an agreement with her mother that her mother would return to collect her at 3:30pm, decided to return home at about 3 p.m. (In cross-examination it was put to her that the time she was travelling home was 4 p.m. rather than 3 p.m., and she agreed with this: T 84). She attempted to telephone her mother on her mother's mobile (but not on the landline) without success, and then decided to leave and to ride home, although she knew it was illegal to ride her trail bike on a public road. 

15As the plaintiff travelled along Newport Road and approached Eva Street on the left hand side, ""a car pulled out in front of me"". She had no prior warning, having first seen this vehicle from a distance of 5 to 10 metres. She slammed on the brakes and, as she did not want to hit the car, swerved her bike, ending up ""in the ditch"" beside the road. The bike lost its balance and fell over on top of her. The car ""took off"" towards Newport Road. All the plaintiff could recall of the car was that it was a white Toyota Corolla. She was certain that it was a Toyota Corolla because her brother had a blue Toyota Corolla.

16Although the plaintiff was in shock and pain, she was able to get the bike up. She was not able to get access to her mobile phone, which was in a clip bag on her back. As her home was about 500 or 600 metres away, she decided to continue to ride home, arriving there approximately 2 to 3 minutes after the crash.

17When she arrived home her mother was there. She left her bike against the fence and ""ran in and started crying"". She told her mother only that she had fallen off her bike.

18The plaintiff said that her mother immediately drove her to Wyong Hospital where she waited for approximately 25 to 30 minutes ""crying and in pain"". She was subsequently given treatment and then sent home. Her boyfriend came to the house and stayed the night. That evening the plaintiff talked to her mother and boyfriend ""a little bit"" about what had happened, but she did not tell the court in examination in chief what was said. 

19The plaintiff had a painful and sleepless night. In the morning was woken by her mother to say that her bike, as well as her boyfriend's trail bike, both of which her boyfriend had stored in the garage on the afternoon of the accident, had both been stolen. Police were called to the premises by the plaintiff's mother, but the plaintiff did not speak to them.

20The plaintiff returned to Wyong Hospital the following day. Her leg injuries were serious, and she was referred to the Burns Unit at the Royal North Shore Hospital. Her mother drove her to Sydney. She was in Royal North Shore Hospital for ""two weeks"", in ""a lot of pain"". During this time her boyfriend visited her on one occasion (T 31). 

21The plaintiff was unable to remember anyone in the hospital asking about how she suffered her injury. The police did not come to either hospital to make inquiries; nor did they come to her home (T 32). She was on heavy medication and recalled little of her treatment.

22The plaintiff recalled ""an interview being arranged with a police officer at Toukley"" and thought that this occurred before she returned to work. She filled in a claim form about the circumstances of the accident. She could not recall when she returned to work, but found that she was unable to perform ""most"" of the duties she had performed prior to the accident. She ""gradually"" got back to her pre-injury hours after the accident over the next four years, but had to transfer to the night shift because the day shift was too strenuous (T 36). She continued to receive treatment from her general practitioners, Dr Olgers and Dr Badenhorst. She transferred to Dr Badenhorst as he was closer, and he prescribed Endep, Panadeine Forte, Valium and Tramadol for her. She is currently taking Lyrica, Tramadol, Valium and Panadol osteo.

23The plaintiff gave detailed evidence about her injuries and disabilities, as well as her difficulties at work and in mowing the garden. This is set out in more detail in the section of this judgment in relation to quantum.

Cross-examination of the plaintiff

24The mechanics of the plaintiff's description of the accident are straightforward. The bulk of the plaintiff's cross-examination consisted of challenges to her accounts of the accident based on her apparently conflicting descriptions of the accident both to Wyong Hospital and the Burns Unit at the Royal North Shore Hospital between 27 June and 12 July 2010. The full text of the Wyong Hospital notes in relation to the plaintiff's description of the accident is set out below. The plaintiff's answer was that she ""didn't say that"", meaning that she did not provide any of the information about the accident contained in these hospital notes (T 93 - 4). In particular, she denied saying that she had come off her bike at 80km/hr and had been stuck under another bike, and that she had been riding with her boyfriend. She told the court there were three other people in hospital who were involved in motorbike accidents, the inference being that that there would have been errors by the hospital staff in recording these details, and that she was so heavily dosed with medication she was ""pretty much out"". She agreed, however, that she did not tell anyone at the hospital that she had swerved to avoid a car (T 94 - 6).

25The plaintiff told her mother on the way home from Wyong Hospital that she had swerved to avoid a car coming out of Edith Street, and that this car had been in the wrong (T 96 - 7). This was prior to the police being called to the home about the bikes being stolen, which occurred overnight (T 97). The plaintiff was ""pretty sure"" her mother had told the police that she had had an accident, but agreed that her mother had not reported this as an incident to the police (T 98) and that the first time this happened was in November 2010 (T 98).

26The plaintiff's answer as to whether the police were told anything about the circumstances of the accident, and if so, what, were inconsistent. It was put to her that her mother did not report the accident as an incident to the police and the plaintiff appeared to agree with this, saying, ""because I knew I would probably lose my licence"" for ""riding unregistered, uninsured, so that's why I didn't do it"". She denied that she did not tell the police about the accident because it did not happen in the way that she had described.

27It was then put to the plaintiff that in the claim form (Exhibit F) she had ticked ""Yes"" for notifying police and that the details given, including the event number, were in fact the event number for the reporting of the stolen bikes for the day following the accident, 28 June 2010. (I note that, in the Chronology provided to the court, the date for notification of the police is also given as 28 June 2010). The plaintiff said this was ""because I thought mum had reported it to the police that day"". However, this is inconsistent with her earlier evidence about not telling police because she could lose her licence (T 98)

28The plaintiff was asked why she had gone to the police 5 months later, and why she had not included, on her claim form, the event number for the visit to the police 5 months later. Her answer, that it could have been the event number given on the day after the accident, was non-responsive (T 100).

29The account of the accident taken by Dr Rajaratnam at Royal North Shore Hospital was also put to the plaintiff. It was put to her that she had told the same story about the circumstances of the accident to him. The plaintiff denied saying any of the words attributed to her in the notes and said she could not explain the history appearing in the notes (T 102). 

30It was put to the plaintiff that she had given three separate accounts of the accident over two days to Royal North Shore Hospital staff to this effect. This included a statement to Registrar Kaufman on 5 July 2010 about landing on her boyfriend's bike after a ""mate in a car"" pulled out in front of her (T 103). She denied she had made these statements. She repeated that, for the periods of time she was in hospital, she was so drugged that she had not been able to understand or communicate. 

31It was put to the plaintiff that the accident did not happen at all, but she denied. It was put to her that on the day in question she was riding with Mr Delalande in a trailer park in Cessnock. The plaintiff said she had never been in Cessnock. It was put to her that Mr Delalande and the plaintiff were driven back to the home, where Mr Delalande put the trail bikes into the garage while the plaintiff was driven to Wyong Hospital by her mother. She denied this, but the circumstances in which Mr Delalande put both trail bikes into the garage (the evidence being that Mr Delalande's bike was always stored there), from which they were subsequently stolen, remained unexplained.

32In re-examination, the plaintiff clarified her reference to the word ""mate"" in the hospital note by saying that she used the phrase ""old mate"" all the time, and that what she had said to the hospital staff was that an ""old mate"" (meaning an unidentified male) had been driving the white Toyota Corolla.

33I note that, in correspondence with the Nominal Defendant, which is set out in more detail below, the same explanation was volunteered, in the context of there being three other bike riders in accidents in her ward on that day.

34The entirety of the relevant extract from Wyong Hospital and Royal North Shore Hospital are set out below. The notes of the Royal North Shore Hospital of 5 July 2010 containing a reference to ""mate in a car"" occurs in the context of a long interview the notes for which suggest that the interviewer was taking notes as the plaintiff and her mother spoke. The entries before and after the relevant paragraphs are correct and the likelihood of an error in the recording of the circumstance of the accident, given the accuracy of the rest of the information, seems unlikely.

35The account of the accident in the Royal North Shore Hospital records is, however, consistent with the accounts provided to Wyong Hospital. Both accounts referred to another bike rider as having been at the scene. There are two accounts to this effect in the Wyong Hospital notes and this is repeated in the account taken by Dr Rajaratnam on 28 June 2010. 

Other issues in cross-examination

36Some of the issues raised in cross-examination were matters where the plaintiff's evidence was reasonable, correct or both. For example, there were inconsistencies about the timing of the accident and why the plaintiff had decided to ride home when she had an arrangement to be collected by her mother at 3.30 pm. The plaintiff said she tried her mother's mobile number six times, but her mother did not answer the phone, and she did not think to try the landline. No explanation was given as to why the plaintiff wanted to finish riding her bike at 3:00pm when the arrangement had been that her mother would collect her at 3:30pm. However, this kind of factual inconsistency is not uncommon in personal injury proceedings, and little or no weight should be given to the somewhat confused and inconsistent explanation the plaintiff had for deciding to ride home illegally on the road. The plaintiff's evidence was that she ""just wanted to get home"" and ""knew"" her mother was at home, and decided to go home by riding along the road. 

37The evidence concerning why the plaintiff did not see the car earlier also contained some inconsistencies. She did not see the other motor vehicle until it was approximately 5 metres away, and did not know why she had not seen the vehicle before T 87). She agreed that the light was starting to reduce at the time of the accident, although the street lights had not yet come on, and that her bike had no headlights (T 84 - 5). However, I note her earlier explanation that there was restricted vision by reason of the topography of the street corners. She had slowed her bike down because she knew how bad the intersection was.

38The plaintiff was cross-examined about her use of the mower to mow the lawn, and when Mr Grant mowed the lawn. I am satisfied that the evidence of the plaintiff on this issue, including her evidence in reply, is correct. While submissions were made that the plaintiff and her mother discussed their evidence and that this was what led to the evidence in reply, I regard it as acceptable for a witness who has already given evidence to seek to correct apparent errors or inconsistencies in this fashion.

39The principal difficulty for the plaintiff was that her evidence of how the accident occurred was not only contradicted by the contemporaneous medical records but by accounts of the accident given by her former boyfriend, Isaac Delalande, so a solicitor acting for the defendant. This brings me to the evidence of Mr Delalande, a witness under subpoena by the defendant but called by the plaintiff.

The evidence of Isaac Delalande

40Mr Delalande, a truck driver aged 24 years, told the court that he commenced having a relationship with the plaintiff approximately a year prior to the accident and this relationship ended shortly after the accident.

41Mr Delalande had spent the night before the accident at the plaintiff's home, but left early in the morning to help out at a friend's house. He received a telephone call from the plaintiff's mother to say that she had been injured. He immediately left his friend's home, intending to travel to Wyong Hospital to see her, but first stopped at her home to make sure ""everything was closed up"", in accordance with a request from the plaintiff's mother. He had no conversation about how the accident happened.

42Mr Delalande remained at Wyong Hospital for one and a half to two hours, and returned with the plaintiff and her mother to the home at Dora Creek, travelling behind them in his own car. He told the court he had no conversation with the plaintiff during the night because she was ""heavily medicated"". The next morning, the plaintiff's brother, who had been about to go to work, came and told Mr Delalande that his bike and the plaintiff's bike, which Mr Delalande had put into the garage the night before, had both been stolen. Precisely whether Mr Delalande had put one or both bikes into the garage that night was never clear; nor was it evident why, if only the plaintiff had ridden her bike, it was necessary for him to put both bikes into the garage.

43Mr Delalande was certain that he never asked the plaintiff about the accident. This was because he used to race motorbikes himself and, he said, ""you never ask about motorbike accidents"".

44Mr Delalande went on to say that he visited Royal North Shore Hospital half a dozen times and had stayed in a hotel there. He repeated that, during that time, he never spoke to the plaintiff about how the accident happened. He denied being with her on the day of the accident when she was riding.

45After his relationship with the plaintiff ended, he had no further contact with the plaintiff or her mother until they ""just started talking again"" about a year after the accident. His bike was returned about eight months after it had been reported stolen to the police.

46Mr Delalande said that he had a telephone conversation with the plaintiff's mother approximately a week before the hearing. He received a subpoena and wanted to know what the subpoena was for, as the plaintiff's name was on it. He told the court that the plaintiff's mother said, ""I can't talk about it"". He denied having any telephone conversation with anyone from the Nominal Defendant about these matters at any time, but amended this to say that he had been asked to sign a statement (Exhibit 13) and sent a document to sign. He had been prepared to do so until his current girlfriend told him that it would be ""wrong to sign a statement which was incorrect"". He also said that ""they [the Nominal Defendant's solicitors] didn't want me to sign it after I told them the real story"".

47In cross-examination, it was put to Mr Delalande that he had provided the information set out in the statement in Exhibit 13 (the text of which is set out below) in the course of a conversation with Ms Frances Allan, the solicitor with conduct of the matter for the Nominal Defendant. He agreed that he had told her this information, but said that it was not the truth. 

48When asked why he would tell lies, he said, ""That's the story we came up with"". He went on to say that this story was invented at the Wyong Hospital on the night of the accident. Contrary to his evidence in chief, the plaintiff had in fact told him that she had had an accident, and how it happened, in that she had an accident while riding on the road. He told her that she could not tell anyone what had happened as she could be prosecuted because she was unlicensed and it was illegal to road an unregistered bike on the road. 

49He was asked how it could be, if this was the agreed story, that there was a reference to another bike in the account of the accident given to the Wyong Hospital. He said, ""If you have a witness, the police don't care"". 

50Mr Delalande considered it likely that the hospital staff would have told the police and the plaintiff could have been prosecuted. This was why he thought they had to say the plaintiff was riding her bike with someone else. When asked how it was that the plaintiff's mother and the plaintiff had told the court that she had been riding alone, he said that he ""didn't know that story"".

51Mr Delalande denied having any further conversations with the plaintiff or her mother about these matters. He thought that he was supposed to continue to tell the lie and did not know that the plaintiff had been to the police, volunteered the information that she had been riding illegally on the road and pleaded guilty to that offence. He thought the purpose of this whole story was to ""tell everyone"" to ensure that she would not be prosecuted. He said he had repeated this story to ""anyone who asks"" such as friends.

52Mr Delalande also agreed he was present when the police attended the premises in relation to the bikes being stolen, which occurred the day after the accident. His evidence as to what was said was not really explored, but it is consistent with his claim that the plaintiff and her mother were anxious to avoid the involvement of the police, that the police would not have been told that the plaintiff suffered injuries on the bike which was stolen in circumstances where she had been riding illegally on the road.

53Mr Delalande's evidence was unsatisfactory in many respects, in that it contains inconsistencies and implausibilities. I am satisfied that there was more contact between Mr Delalande and the plaintiff's mother than he has acknowledged. In particular, I am satisfied that there was a Facebook exchange between them which led to the telephone call, and that this telephone call played an important part in his revising his evidence.

The statement prepared for Mr Delalande

54What did Mr Delalande tell Ms Allan? Exhibit 13 is an unsigned statement of Isaac Delalande, which contains the following:

""STATEMENT OF ISAAC DELALANDE

This statement made by me accurately sets out the evidence which I would be prepared, if necessary, to give in court as a witness. The statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

My full name is Isaac Delalande. I was born on [date] 1990 and I reside at [address].

On 27 June 2010 I was trail bike riding with Lauren Buggy on a friend's property in the Cessnock area. We were riding on a track at the back of my friend's property.

I was travelling ahead of Lauren. I applied my brake to slow my bike down. Shortly afterwards Lauren's bike collided with the rear of my bike.

As a result of the collision Lauren's leg impacted with the rear tyre of my motorbike and she suffered a friction injury.

Following the collision I loaded the bikes onto my vehicle. I drove Lauren and our two motorcycles to her mother's property at [address].

On arrival at Lauren's mother's house I proceeded to put the motorbikes and associated gear into the shed. During this time Lauren's mother transported her to Wyong Base Hospital. I subsequently met Lauren at the hospital.

On the night of 27 June 2010 our bikes and associated gear were stolen from Lauren's mother's residence. That resulted in a Police investigation and I subsequently recovered my motorbike.""

55While Mr Delalande was an unsatisfactory witness, Ms Allan, who interviewed him for the purpose of taking this statement, was not. I shall briefly set out the information she provided to the court.

The evidence of Ms Frances Allan

56Ms Allan is a partner at TL Lawyers, the solicitors for the defendant; she has the same surname as counsel for the defendant. 

57Ms Allan told the court that, on the Monday of the week prior to the hearing, she contacted Mr Delalande to confirm he had received a subpoena to give evidence and asked if he had any questions. She also asked him what occurred on the day in question. That conversation went into specific detail which she recorded as he spoke. She asked him to sign the statement and he agreed, but said that he was only available at a time when Ms Allan could not attend his home. Before completing the telephone call, Ms Allan read out what she had written and said she would prepare a statement based on that information.

58Another solicitor attended Mr Delalande's home with the statement and reported back to Ms Allan that he would not sign it.

59In cross-examination, Ms Allan was asked why it took so long for her to locate Mr Delalande. She explained that the police records which were contained in packet 22 had redacted the names of the persons present when the bike was reported stolen. It was only after a second subpoena was issued, which occurred after the August 2014 sittings of Gosford Court, that she obtained Mr Delalande's name and was then able to locate him.

60It was put to Ms Allan that she could have sought the name of the plaintiff's boyfriend in particulars. Ms Allan said, and I accept, that seeking the name of the ""boyfriend"" referred to in the Royal North Shore Hospital notes of 5 July 2010 in particulars would have been unproductive, as the plaintiff's case was that he was not there. 

61It was also put to Ms Allan that she could have sent out an investigator to take a statement from Mr Delalande. Ms Allan said this decision was not made. I consider that it was entirely appropriate for the solicitor with carriage of the matter to have interviewed this witness, rather than delegating such a potentially complex task to an investigator.

62It was put to Ms Allan that she had no idea what Mr Delalande was going to say when he was served with the subpoena. Ms Allan said that when she telephoned Mr Delalande he told her that the plaintiff ""went up the back of me"" and that it was for this reason that she prepared the statement and issued the subpoena. This is a proper basis for the issuing of a subpoena. 

63It was put to Ms Allan that the statement contained implausibilities. For example, the likelihood of travelling from Cessnock to Wyong when there was a hospital at Cessnock. Ms Allan said that she had written down what Mr Delalande told her and I accept her evidence on this point.

64The principal change to Ms Allan's evidence was that she had had plenty of time to make these inquiries, the inference being that by raising these matters late, the defendant was seeking to muddy the waters rather than to produce evidence capable of changing the plaintiff's account. 

65At the time of making these inquiries, all Ms Allan had was the plaintiff's explanation in relation to the reference to ""boyfriend"" and ""mate"" in earlier notes had been that there were errors in the taking of information from her whilst she was in Royal North Shore Hospital due to confusion with other patients in the ward. It was not unreasonable for the solicitors for the defendant to have accepted such an explanation; this was an explanation they had sought on the basis that they were considering whether due inquiry and search had been made. I am satisfied that the circumstances in which Mr Delalande was not located earlier are understandable.

66Both the plaintiff and her mother were called in reply. 

The plaintiff in reply

67Both the plaintiff and her mother gave further evidence about the mower used to mow the lawns. It was put to both of them that they had discussed their evidence. I regard this evidence as being of little significance. As is noted above, both had completed their evidence, and I do not see it as inappropriate for a party to advise that evidence of an incorrect matter had been given, especially concerning a relatively trivial matter such as the correct brand of the mower used to mow their lawn. However, the evidence each gave in response to Mr Delalande's evidence raised matters which undermined their credit as witnesses.

The evidence of Mrs French

68The plaintiff's mother, Mrs French, told the court that, on the day of the accident, she took her daughter to the quarry to have a ride between 2 pm and 2.30 pm, telling her: ""I'll pick you up at 3.30"" (T 127). She had intended to go back at 3.30 but forgot the time. She did not hear her mobile ring as she had music on and was vacuuming. 

69The first Mrs French knew of the accident was when she heard screaming, ""Mum, mum"", through the front door and saw her daughter there. Her daughter said ""I had an accident"". Mrs French took her daughter to Wyong Hospital immediately. She had no conversation with her on the way, but told the front desk staff that she could not get her daughter out of the car, and that she had had an accident. The nurse said ""What happened"" and Mrs French said, ""I said she had a motor vehicle or motorbike accident and they handed me a CTP claim form and they called it something"" (namely an MVA form) and told her to fill this in (T 130). However, Mrs French was too worried about her daughter ever to fill this in.

70At her daughter's request Mrs French contacted Isaac Delalande and asked him, on the way to the hospital, to check on the house as she had left in such a hurry. There was no conversation about how the accident had happened (T 131). He returned with the plaintiff and Mrs French to their home and stayed the night. Mrs French said she asked the plaintiff ""what happened"" and the plaintiff replied she ""just didn't want to talk about it"" (T 132). She put the plaintiff straight to bed but was awoken by her son who told her that the garage door was open and both the motorcycles had been stolen. Once she learned the bikes were stolen she went in and woke Lauren to tell her (T 133). She also said ""Now tell me what happened"" because ""I needed to call the police"" and the plaintiff told her she was ""on her way home from the bike track and that a car had pulled out and she had swerved to miss it"" (T 133) in Edith Street.

71Mrs French said she ""got on the phone"" to the ""Wyong-Toronto police and ""called the police assistance line as well"". The Toronto police said they would send someone down because the bikes had been stolen and ""I thought while she [the woman police officer] was down there I'll tell her about the accident as well"" (T 133).

72Isaac Delalande was still there when the police officer arrived at between 6.45 and 7 a.m. She told the police officer that the bikes had been stolen and that ""also my daughter had an accident the day before"". When asked what details she had given, she said ""I told her what Lauren had told me"" (T 135). The police officer ""didn't seem too concerned, or cared"" because ""all she was interested in was getting someone from forensics down to do the prints because there's been so many bikes stolen in the area"". A forensics officer had come later that day, but there had been no discussion about the accident.

73Mrs French took her daughter back to Wyong Hospital and was advised to take her straight down to Royal North Shore Hospital. They had no conversation about how the accident occurred (T 137). She was told by the hospital to return the next day. She remained with the plaintiff throughout. She had a conversation with one of the social workers and told her ""exactly what I've just told you, that she had a motorcycle accident"" (T 138). She repeated the description given by Lauren, namely that ""she was on her way home from the bike track and that a car had pulled out"" (T 138). She also ""had a lot to say"" about the plaintiff's past history because the plaintiff was so distraught. She told the social worker about her divorce in 2008, that Isaac was bipolar and had ""multiple personality disorders"" (T 139).

74In cross-examination, Mrs French said she was not with her daughter when she saw the triage nurse or doctor in the emergency department of Wyong Hospital (T 153) and that her daughter did not tell her how the accident happened the following day. She never heard the plaintiff tell the doctor that she had been involved in an accident when she ran into another motorbike and landed on the tyre (T 155).

75Mrs French was certain that she had told the police officer who attended her home the day after the accident about the circumstances of the accident in which her daughter was involved. She was familiar with the making of a claim for damages for injury from a motor vehicle accident. She considered the event number given covered both the reporting of the stolen bikes and the circumstances of the plaintiff's accident.

76Mrs French was not present every time that a doctor took a history from her daughter because she was ""asked to step outside the room"". She was not present when the plaintiff was interviewed by Dr Kaufman or Dr Rajaratnam. She was certain she had not been told that Isaac Delalande was present when her daughter was injured, and said that he only came to the hospital once. She was certain that she had had no recent contact with Mr Delalande (T 158).

77After Mr Delalande's evidence, Mrs French was called in reply to correct her evidence about having no contact with Mr Delalande (T 209). He had contacted her on Facebook with a message to ""please call me"". She had rung him and he said ""What the hell's going on"", to which she replied ""just tell the truth"" (T 209, 215). When asked in cross-examination what else was discussed she said ""nothing, basically"" (T 215). 

78Also in her evidence in reply, Mrs French said that she and Mr Delalande had never concocted a story about her daughter's accident occurring on private property in Cessnock for the purpose of avoiding police prosecution. Her daughter had never been to Cessnock to ride her bike.

79If Mr Delalande had concocted a story with the plaintiff and her mother to avoid the plaintiff being prosecuted, it would have been a straightforward matter to disclose this to the court. This would certainly have been understandable in relation to the failure to tell the police, on the day after the accident, that the plaintiff had been illegally riding her bike on the road the day before the bike was stolen. However, the plaintiff and her mother did not do so. Instead, the accuracy and competency of the record-keeping by the police and the staff of both the Wyong and Royal North Shore Hospital were challenged. 

Hospital and police records extracts

80In view of the differences between the evidence of the witnesses for the plaintiff and the contemporaneous hospital and police records, I have set these out below in full.

Wyong Hospital records dated 27 June 2010

81The Wyong Hospital Emergency Department Admission notes record the following on 27 June 2010:

""Patient condition on arrival: Alert, oriented, painful friction burn to inside of ® thigh from spinning tyre (motorbike) came off bike at ~80kms + got stuck under other bike.

Hard collar in situ, nil neuro deficit.""

82The wavy line may mean ""approximately"" or ""greater than"" 80 kmh. This is the only reference to speed in any of the notes. The plaintiff denied riding at this speed and said that she had slowed down because she knew the intersection where she had the accident was dangerous. 

83One of the reasons given by the plaintiff for these errors is that she was heavily medicated. The plaintiff's condition on arrival at 4.20pm describes her as ""alert, orientated"" and suffering from a ""painful friction burn to inside of R[ight] thigh from spinning tyre (motorbike)"" after she: came off bike at [wavy line] 80 kms & got stuck under other bike."" At 4.47 p.m. the plaintiff is again described as ""alert"": the notes describe her as ""alert/pink/responsive"" and ""in minimal distress"". 

84A medical officer surnamed Wirth described the accident as follows:

""18 y.o. [female] involved in MBA [illegible] 2 x motorcycles. Entangled. Other bike rear wheel abrasion to med[ial] aspect lower R[ight] thigh = 15 x 10 cm partial thickness abrasion, contaminated with tyre, rubber. Also extensive, superficial abrasions over buttocks x 2.""

85On 27 June 2010 (at 7.10 p.m.) the nursing notes state that the plaintiff had ""fasted since breakfast"", was allergic to Stemetil, and underwent cleaning of the wound. She was sent home with Panadeine Forte and told to return at 2 p.m. the next day for review.

86On 28 June 2010 the plaintiff was seen by Dr Rajaratnam, who stated:

""18 y.o. [female] who was involved in MBA [motorbike accident] yesterday.

-ran into another motorbike

- thrown off motorbike - landed on tyre

- sustained friction burn to R[ight] inner thigh and buttock

- p[atien]t given pain relief and wound cleaned of debris

- tetanus updated age 16

- pt otherwise well

- able to cope with pain at home

- [illegible]

- Pt alert, well.""

87Further down the page is a note by the surgery registrar that the plaintiff ""fell off motorbike"".

88Dr Rajaratnam, the surgery registrar and a Dr Harris appear to have had discussions about the plaintiff's treatment, according to the notes. The plaintiff was sent home again with a dressing, as she was not able to cope with an open wound, especially at night.

89The notes for 30 June 2010 from Dr John Ella, also in Exhibit 9,describe the plaintiff as ""generally well"" and note the plaintiff's allergies and immunisation history. He then states:

""Sustained burns to inner R[ight] thigh & buttocks 4/7 [4 days] ago. Burn caused by friction from motor cycle tyre.""

90As there were signs of infection in the buttock wounds and a partial to full thickness burn to the medial right thigh, the plaintiff was referred to the Burns Clinic at Royal North Shore Hospital (see the last page of Exhibit 9).

91The plaintiff was first seen on 1 July, and then admitted to, the Burns Unit at Royal North Shore Hospital on 2 July 2010. The admitting medical officer was Dr Roland Jiang (see the last four pages of Exhibit 8). Consent forms were signed by her mother on 1 July 2010. 

92Nursing notes for 2 July 2010 describe the plaintiff as ""stable, afebrile"" and tolerating the diet well. They also note, at 5 p.m. pm 2 July 2010 that the plaintiff:

""...spoke about her accident. She thought she would die + has been feeling anxious ++ since. Her boyfriend appears to have some mental health issues + according to pt's mother there has been much stress + difficulty. I have asked the boyfriend to leave in order to minimise tension/conflict in pt's room. Pt happy with this.

Pt reports flashbacks + intrusive thoughts re: accident. She says she feels overwhelmed + is not able to rest/sleep. Her mother will stay this evening for support.""

93The notes for 3 July describe the plaintiff as complaining of pain and of 4 July as ""stable"" and ""afebrile"". The plaintiff's mother was noted as having been there, which comforted her.

94On 5 July 2010 the plaintiff was interviewed at length by a hospital staff member with an illegible signature. The plaintiff's explanation for the inconsistencies between this account and her evidence in court is that she was in a drugged state, that the hospital staff confused her with other patients and/or that a person other than the plaintiff (Mr Quickenden suggested another ""hospital worker"") supplied this information. This requires the setting out of this entry in full.

Royal North Shore Hospital records dated 5 July 2010

95The version of the accident appearing in the Burns Unit records include a long interview with the plaintiff on 5 July 2010, slightly more than a week after the accident. It commences with a description of the accident as follows:

""18 y.o. [female]

Admitted [with] burns to R[ight] lower inner thigh + bilateral buttocks.

Motorbike accident: - was riding a motorbike, mate in a car pulled out in front of her, jumped off her bike, landed on boyfriend's motorbike tyre.

Pain OK, due for skin graft Wed[nesday].

Reports some flashbacks, feeling anxious. Sleeping OK when had Phenergan. Feeling nauseated ++ from pain med[ication]s.

Feels she is going to die when has flashbacks.

Mood teary + despondent. Irritable ++.

Appetite [down] but eating.

Worried about imminent D/c home.

2o [sic] restrictions on mobility

QHx: * recent break up with best friend [down] ,ppd irritability, teary, insomnia, [anxiety], claims suicidal feelings [wavy line] 1/12 [one month] before accident.

* Boyfriend has B.A.D.

* ?anxiety [arrow] sleep [with] mum at times.

QHx family: mother anxiety used to take Xanax

Social: - lives with mother + brother (25 y.) + brother's girlfriend

- finished nursing (aged care)

- has boyfriend since May '10

Developmental: Grew up on the Central Coast. Parents separated Lauren aged 9. Stepdad 6 - 7/12 past separation not a good relationship (had bipolar + alcoholism) [illegible] to mum for 7y school to Y 10.

Horticultural course 6/12

Nursing - aged care

Traumatic events: - verbal aggression by stepdad

- helped to nurse stepdad after a major MVA

- major MVA with mum (Lauren + brother in the back""

96The report concludes by noting the plaintiff was not feeling well, covering her eyes with her hand and wanting to go back to sleep teary and depressed and ""unable to assess thought form and content"". There is then a note that ""Mum states no suicidal ideation"" but that sleep, appetite and concentration were down (insofar as this can be interpreted from the downward arrow). The conclusion was ""acute stress reaction on the background of possibly recently developed depression/anxiety in the context of interpersonal difficulties"" and the plan was for review and medication (Exhibit 8).

97The dietician notes the plaintiff as having had a ""motorcycle accident"" (5 July 2010). The physiotherapist, on the same day (at 2.30 p.m.), notes the plaintiff as telling her she was ""due to start working in Nursing Home today"". Notes over the next few days deal only with her treatment. There are references to the plaintiff's mother as being present and as remaining in Sydney (see for example 9 July 2010). She was discharged on 12 July 2010.

98These notes were provided by the hospital to the parties on 10 November 2011, according to the covering sheet on Exhibit 8. I note:

(a)No Wyong Hospital notes (let alone the entries describing the accident) appear in Exhibit 8, so any potential for contamination of the information by Burns Unit staff viewing the Wyong Hospital notes is unlikely. 

(b)Secondly, the plaintiff and her mother give details of the accident as having occurred in the same manner described by her to Wyong Hospital. 

(c)Thirdly, the sources of the information about the plaintiff are clearly the plaintiff herself, with some corroboration by her mother. 

(d)Fourthly, the plaintiff's boyfriend appears to have visited only once, and to have been asked not to remain, to the relief of the plaintiff, and the likelihood that he was telling them what to say, given the request for him to go, seems remote. 

(e)Finally, the plaintiff also informed the hospital that she was due to commence work on a particular date, and that date is inconsistent both with her evidence in these proceedings and to experts providing medico-legal reports.

99I am satisfied that the plaintiff and her mother gave consistent reports to two hospitals over the period 27 June to (at least) 5 July 2010 of the accident as having occurred while the plaintiff was trail bike riding with her boyfriend, in circumstances where no white Toyota Corolla appearing suddenly in the street caused her to swerve. 

100Two additional pieces of information are obtained from this long account of the plaintiff's accident and injuries taken on 5 July 2010. First, there is a reference to a car which swerves. However, this is not a white car driven by a stranger, but a ""mate's"" car, driven in circumstances where the plaintiff and her boyfriend were riding together and she landed on his tyre after the car belonging to the ""mate"" caused her to jump. The second piece of information is that the ""boyfriend"" is identified as the other rider at the scene. The plaintiff's explanation of this reference, namely that she calls all men ""mate"", is implausible in the light of this careful note-taking, as is her denial of her boyfriend being at the scene.

101The plaintiff's injuries were serious, and she and her mother were clearly anxious to have them properly treated. Whatever the effect of the medication, the plaintiff was clearly able to provide both hospitals with considerable detail about allergies and her medical history. The likelihood that the plaintiff gave the wrong history because she was heavily drugged is remote. The fact that she was on heavy medication would have made it harder to lie, rather than easier. Additionally, the incentive to tell the truth and to describe the accident as accurately as possible, in circumstances where correct treatment was vital, would have been high. 

102The likelihood that two sets of hospital staff made similar mistakes about the circumstances of the plaintiff's accident, particularly in relation to the 5 July 2010 notes, is low. This information was supplied in the course of obtaining a wide range of personal information, the rest of which is correct. There is no evidence to support the claim that three other persons in the ward were bike riding accident victims and that the facts of those cases could have been transposed. 

103Additionally, the information the plaintiff and her mother give about what was said to the police is inconsistent with the police records relating to the visit the day after the accident.

[Details of Isaac Delalande's and Lauren Buggy's motorcycle]""

107The plaintiff and her mother were certain that the police had been told about the circumstances of the plaintiff's accident during this visit by police to their home.

108The plaintiff, however, did not set out in her personal injury claim form (signed on 2 December 2010, and tendered as Exhibit E) the police officers' details as requested in answer to Question 6. Instead, she gave the ""Police Assistance Line"" as the person to whom the accident had been reported on 28 June 2010. An incident number (E#42436152) was provided, but it is common ground that this was the incident number for the report of the theft of the motorbikes Mr Delalande put in his shed. There is no evidence that a call was made to the Police Assistance Line.

109The plaintiff did not refer, on this claim form, to her visit to the police station in November 2010, or provide that incident number. There was no evidence to explain why, if the plaintiff believed she had already notified police of the accident, she needed to consult them again.

110Question 7 of the personal injury claim form asked: ""Is police action going to be taken?"". The plaintiff ticked the box for ""Don't know"" and did not fill out the other questions, such as ""name of person charged (if known)"". This was misleading in several respects. First, the police had taken action in relation to the bikes; they had been recovered on 22 October 2012, according to the COPS report, and there was also the question (which apparently was not yet determined) of whether the plaintiff would herself be the subject of a charge. 

111Second, there was no evidence in relation to why, if the plaintiff had reported the accident on 28 June 2010, she attended the police station on 19 November 2011 to report it a second time. Mr Quickenden, in the course of submissions, said that the reason for the 19 November 2014 visit was that the plaintiff was being ""proactive"", the inference being that she was concerned that nothing had been done, despite police having located and returned the motor bikes to the plaintiff and to Mr Delalande.

112Additionally, if the plaintiff was being proactive and following up her earlier report of 28 June 2014, a reference to the earlier report of the accident would be expected to be included in the COPS report. There is no reference to it at all.

113What did the plaintiff tell the police on 19 November 2010? This brings me to a consideration of the COPS report (Exhibit 6).

Police records dated 19 November 2010

114A police report was created on 19 November 2010, but the report tendered was dated 23 December 2010, to include the ultimate decision (after some uncertainty) to charge the plaintiff. The description of the accident was as follows: 

""At 3pm on the 27th June 2010, Lauren BUGGY had just finished riding on a dirt track at Dora Creek on her Yamaha YZ250 trail bike.

From here BUGGY rode east along Newport Road, Dora Creek at approximately 50km/h in an easterly direction.

As BUGGY reached the Newport Road and Edith Street intersection at Dora Creek, a white Toyota Corolla has pulled out from Edith street onto Newport Road.

In an attempt to avoid a collision, BUUGY [sic] has taken evasive action. In doing so BUGGY has lost control of her dirt bike, and has gone over the handle bars and then landed on the road with the bike on top of her.

Whilst in this position the rear wheel has spun on her leg ripping through her protective riding gear.

BUGGY was taken to Wyong Hospital by her Mother, where she was treated for a full thickness friction burn to her right thigh.

Advise [sic] sought from S/Sgt LODGE and prosecutors, that no action to be taken against rider BUGGY. Occurrence only as per NSW Police Handbook; Only record details where the injuries suffered are of a personal or bodily nature and it is If there is no record on COPS, create an occurenconly [sic] Event and mark it for the station summary.

On the 19th of November the accused attended Toukley Police Station to report the following collision.

At 3pm on the 27th of June 2010, the accused person Lauren BUGGY, was the rider of a Yamaha YZ 250 trail bike.

At the time the accused had just finished riding in a track in Dora Creek. At the conclusion of this session the accused rode her unregistered trail bike out of the track and onto Newport road, Dora Creek.

Here the accused proceed to ride at an approximate speed of 60km/h in an easterly direction.

As the accused entered the Newport Road and Edith Street intersection of Dora Creek, a white Toyota Corolla made a right hand turn from Edith Street into the oncoming path of the accused on Newport Road.

It is at this point that the accused person took evasive action to in an attempt to avoid a collision with this vehicle.

In attempting to avoid the other vehicle the accused lost control, which caused her to lose balance. Within a second the accused was on the roadway wedged between the bike and the bitumen road.

The trail bikes rear wheel was still spinning at speed onto the accused persons [sic] right thigh.

The accused has got up from the roadway and after approximately ten (10) minutes restarted the bike and gone to her home address.

The accused person's Mother transported the accused to Wyong Local Hospital where she was treated for full thickness friction burns to her right thigh.

As a result of this injury the accused has received ongoing skin grafts and numerous other medical procedures.

The accused is the holder of NSW Drivers Licence [number], which is an active P1 Provisional Class C licence.

Newport Road, Dora Creek is a road within NSW.

At the time of this incident the weather was fine, traffic light and it was daylight.

The accused trail bike is an unregistered vehicle.

The accused is now charged with the matter before the Court.""

115I was told from the bar table that the plaintiff pleaded guilty and that no conviction was recorded. No documents were tendered in relation to these events.

The plaintiff's description of the accident to medical practitioners

116The plaintiff's description of the accident to medical practitioners, and in particular to experts preparing medico-legal reports, closely resembles her description of the accident in her evidence before me. Dr Vincent, in his report of 28 February 2012 to the plaintiff's solicitors, records the following:

""History of Injury and Treatment

On 27 June 2010 she was involved in a motorbike accident. She swerved to avoid an oncoming car and came off her bike. Her right leg was caught in the back wheel which was still revolving and caused a friction burn to the lower thigh posteriorly. She had abrasions to both buttocks. She was admitted to Wyong Hospital and transferred the next day to Royal North Shore Hospital Burns Unit for management. She required two operations, initially five days postoperatively she had a debridement of the wound of the right leg and dressings to the abrasions of the buttock. Another five days later at day 10 she had a split skin graft applied to the healing wound of the right leg. She had dressings at Royal North Shore Hospital until healed and wore a pressure garment for about six months. She had physiotherapy mainly to her hip, leg and back which is ongoing. She required a cortisone injection to her back for a disc problem in September 2011. She has ongoing pain for which she takes Endep, Panadol Osteo and Endone as required for pain.""

117However, there are no contemporaneous notes from the plaintiff's general practitioners or treating doctors. It is unclear to me who was her general practitioner at the relevant time, as the plaintiff has given conflicting accounts.

The plaintiff's treating doctors

118Who were the plaintiff's treating doctors and what information can they provide as to the plaintiff's injuries and treatment? This was information which one would expect to find either in documents under subpoena or in the medico-legal reports. 

119The medico-legal reports are of little assistance. The plaintiff told Dr Walker that she was treated by Dr Rajaratnam at the Burns Unit. Dr Rajaratnam is the author of some of the Burns Unit entries set out above. However, his role in the plaintiff's care ceased after 12 July 2010. The plaintiff told Dr Conrad (report, 8 June 2012) that after she left hospital, she continued to have treatment from her general practitioner, Dr Badenhorst. There is no report from Dr Badenhorst. 

120The medical records from the Waratah Medical Centre set out in Exhibit A show a gap in the plaintiff seeking treatment from 3 November 2009 to 7 December 2010, when the plaintiff consulted Dr Badenhorst with a sore throat and fever. The two entries are on the same page, so it is unlikely that the explanation is that insufficient records have been provided. Additionally, this gap in the plaintiff's records was also noted by the Review Panel, as is set out in more detail below.

121The plaintiff said in her evidence that her general practitioner was Dr Badenhorst. The first medical record that has been tendered for treatment by Dr Badenhorst referring to the accident was dated March 21, 2011, nearly a year later, when the plaintiff complained of a sore hip from a ""previous motor-cycle injury 2010"", although he must have seen her earlier, as he referred her for a hip X-ray which Dr Roy performed on 22 March 2011. He saw her again on April 4 and 11, May 2 and June 3, about myofascial pain and slight discogenic disease and referred her for X-rays. The plaintiff did suffer soft tissue injury and disc herniation at L4/5 and L5/S1 and clearly consulted him about these problems. The remaining visits the plaintiff made to this doctor appear to deal largely with unrelated personal matters. He has not provided a report.

122In his report of 21 January 2014 Dr Gertler does not name the ""general practitioner"" prescribing anti-depressants for the plaintiff, but he lists the medical reports provided to him; the only relevant documents would be the notes from Waratah Medical Services (Exhibit A, page 1 of Dr Gertler's report), which contain the gap commented upon by the Review Panel. He was told she took Cymbalta 60 mg daily. I could not find a reference to Cymbalta in the medical notes or the list of prescriptions given between 17 September 2009 and 9 January 2012 in the documents tendered by the plaintiff (see Exhibit A). However, the explanation seems to be that it was only ""in recent months"" that such a prescription was provided (report, page 4). If Dr Gertler confirmed that information by checking the Waratah Medical Services records, he may have had records which have not been provided to the court, or he may simply not have checked.

123Dr Philip Olgers signed the plaintiff's personal injury claim form. He also referred the plaintiff for a knee X-ray for ""MVA [sic] one month ago"" (report of Grace Tai, 4 August 2010, Exhibit A). There is no report from Dr Olgers and, as the Review Panel noted when they saw them, what records he provided were illegible.

124Dr Robin Higgs, in his report of 2 September 2013, states that the plaintiff is under the care of her general practitioner, Dr Suri (page 4, Exhibit A). There is no report from Dr Suri.

125The plaintiff told Dr Robin Higgs that she continued to attend Wyong Hospital for review of her friction burns (page 8, Exhibit A). No documents or reports were tendered in relation to these visits. That does not mean that these visits did not occur, but means there is nothing to challenge (or confirm) the earlier Wyong Hospital accounts of the accident.

126The confusion concerning which doctor was treating the plaintiff, and for what, is not made easier by the fact that the Review Panel revoked the 1 July 2013 certificate and made substitute findings in relation to the right knee, cervical spine and lumbar spine injuries. The Panel noted Dr Olgers provided a certificate dated 25 November 2010 in relation to the plaintiff's burns, and also noted, in relation to the general practitioner records provided, that ""the immediate period around the subject accident is not covered""; there was a ""prolonged gap"" between the 3 November 2009 entry and the next entry of 7 December 2010 (Exhibit A, page 7) and in addition:

""The panel noted prescriptions for Panamax and Neurofen, an anti-inflammatory medication, but no mention of the subject motor vehicle accident."" (Exhibit A, page 7 of the report)

127The Panel decided to request further information from Dr Olgers on the basis that he was ""noted by the panel to have arranged plain x-rays on 4/8/2010 so had been seeing the claimant during the early days post accident."" These were provided, and were described by the Panel as follows:

""The panel received the clinical noted of Dr Philip Olgers under cover of a letter from MAS dated 9/12/13.

The handwritten records were very difficult to read...

There were handwritten records pertaining to the subject accident from July 2010 and August 2010. However, these were brief and illegible."" [Page 10 of the Report]

128Those records have not been tendered.

129The plaintiff, when interviewed by the Panel, said she had consulted Dr Badenhorst, not Dr Olger (page 11 of the Report). She told the Panel she was being prescribed Cymbalta 60 mg, Lyrica, Endone 5 mg as necessary, Tranadol, Panadol osteo (6 tablets a day) and Valium (once daily) (page 12). There are patient management records for her dated April 2011 and onwards (Exhibit Q). These include a very different account of the plaintiff's home life and her academic difficulties, such as having to leave school half way through Year 10 (see notes 29 November 2012). She has been having ongoing treatment by a Dr Alex Smoleniec; no report from him has been provided. 

130There is thus almost a total absence of contemporaneous general practitioner reports concerning the plaintiff's treatment at the time of, and in the months (and indeed years) following the accident. The plaintiff's tender of the Waratah Medical Services notes is, for the reasons explained by the Review Panel, completely irrelevant to the issues in this case. The tender of investigative reports such as a CT Brain scan and injection reports provide little insight into the plaintiff's ongoing treatment. Although the plaintiff referred in her evidence to Dr Badenhorst, it is at best uncertain who the plaintiff's general practitioner was. Whatever the reasons for this, the plaintiff is deprived of the opportunity of pointing to contemporaneous medical records setting out her account of the accident and ongoing treatment prior to the medico-legal reports which are prepared from 2012 onwards.

131The plaintiff's explanation for any inconsistencies between her account and the hospital and police records is her drugged state immediately following the injury, incompetence by the hospital staff in recording other patients' details, and incompetence by the police in failing to record, on 28 June 2010, the circumstances of her accident. The likelihood that so many professionals were performing their duties incompetently, in terms of failing to write down important information accurately, is hard to accept. The absence of contemporaneous notes from the plaintiff's treating doctor (or even certainty as to who that doctor was) is a small but unfortunate gap in the evidence. I do not draw any inference from their absence, but I note the comments of the Review Panel set out above.

132The internal inconsistencies in the plaintiff's evidence, and the inconsistencies of the evidence of Mrs French and the plaintiff when compared to the evidence of Mr Delalande, are also of relevance. This brings me to a consideration of the issue of the credit of the plaintiff and her witnesses.

The credit of the plaintiff and her witnesses

133The court's approach to the determination of witness credit issues has been the subject of extensive jurisprudence, some of which is summarised in Thornton v Telegraph Media Group Ltd [2011] EWHC 1884 (QB) at [73]-[74]. The New South Wales Court of Appeal, in a series of judgments, notably Malco Engineering Pty Ltd v Ferreira (1994) 10 NSWCCR 117 per Handley JA at 118D-E, Shekhani v Ardino [2009] NSWCA 361 at [11] - [99], Sangha v Baxter [2009] NSWCA 78 at [13] and, more recently, Azar v Kathirgamalingan [2012] NSWCA 429 at [87] - [90], has carefully explained the role credibility plays in relation to personal injury proceedings. 

134The correct approach to the creditworthiness of witnesses has also been the subject of extra-curial writing. I particularly note the contributions of The Honourable Justice McClellan, ""Who is telling the truth? Psychology, common sense and the law"" (2006) 80 Australian Law Journal 655; The Honourable Justice Ipp ""Problems with Fact-finding"" (Supreme Court of New South Wales, 2 September 2006) http://www.supremecourt.justice.nsw.gov.au/agdbasev7wr/supremecourt/documents/pdf/ipp_speeches.pdf; and Lord Bingham, ""The Judge as Juror: The Judicial Determination of Factual Issues"" (""The Business of Judging"", Oxford 2000, pp 3ff; Current Legal Problems, Vol 38 Stevens & Sons Ltd 1985 page 1-27)).

135It is well-recognised that the demeanour of a witness in the artificial atmosphere of the witness box is of little assistance. In Hecron v Cousens [1990] NSWCA 93 Kirby P explained:

""Scientific evidence and psychological experimentation has cast serious doubt on the reliability of assessing credibility from the impression made by witnesses in the artificial environment of the courtroom. See, e.g., Australian Law Reform Commission, Evidence (ALRC 26), AGPS, Canberra, 1985, 452ff; L Re, ""Oral versus Written Evidence: The Myth of the 'Impressive Witness'"" (1983) 57 ALJ 679. Good judges have always been circumspect about their capacity to discern truth-telling from lying by the impression which a witness makes on them in court. Thus, in Société d'Avances Commerciales v Merchants Marine Insurance Co (1924) 20 Ll L Rep 140, 152 (CA) Atkin LJ said: ""I think than an ounce of intrinsic merit or demerit in the evidence, that is to say the value of the comparison of evidence with known facts, is worth pounds of demeanour."" 

136In Lec v Matthews (1926) 25 Ll L Rep 525 at 543, the same distinguished judge declared: ""The lynx-eyed Judge who can discern the truth-teller from the liar by looking at him is more often found in fiction or in appellate judgments than on the Bench.""

137Findings on credit generally relate to the examination of internal inconsistencies or implausibilities in the evidence of a witness, conflicting testimony between witnesses and/or inconsistent documentation (in particular, contemporary business records or other documents prepared by persons unrelated to the litigation. Care should be taken, however, when considering the contents of busy professionals such as ambulance officers and hospital staff, whose concern is to treat what could be life-threatening injuries rather than to record how the accident occurred: Davis v Council of the City of Wagga Wagga [2004] NSWCA 34 at [35]; Mason v Demasi [2009] NSWCA 227 at [2]; Container Terminals Australia v Huseyin [2008] NSWCA 320 at [8]; Kappadoukas v Fransepp Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 366 at [56]; Mastronardi v State of New South Wales [2009] NSWCA 270 at [87]; Hill v Richards [2011] NSWCA 291 at [23]. 

138Where the court finds that a witness has told a lie, either in the proceedings before the court, or in other court proceedings, the correct approach for the tribunal of fact to take is as set out in Malco Engineering Pty Ltd v Ferreira(1994) 10 NSWCCR 117. The court should be slow to make such a finding, and should be comfortably satisfied that such a finding is warranted. The nature of the lie is also important - a witness's lie may be of tangential relevance (for example, lying about one's weight, or medication, or future job aspirations) or it may be central to the issues in the case (such as whether the accident occurred at all, or in the circumstances described).

139The degree of relevance that issues of credit may have to proceedings against the Nominal Defendant, and how to apply any such findings, will depend upon the facts of the case. For example, where a plaintiff has no recollection of events due to the circumstances of the accident and/or injuries received, issues of credit need to be determined with care. This was apparent in both appeals brought in Nominal Defendant v McLennan [2012] NSWCA 148 and McLennan v Nominal Defendant [2014] NSWCA 332.

140The facts in those proceedings were as follows. The plaintiff, who was getting out of his car in a car park at 4.30 am, saw car lights behind him and heard a car motor revving, but thereafter could not recall what happened. The trial judge noted, in relation to inconsistencies in evidence and medical opinions, that he intended to ""proceed cautiously on an issue by issue analysis of the matters in dispute, rather than to apply a blanket credit finding against the plaintiff."" The Court of Appeal, in setting aside the trial judge's adverse credit findings against the plaintiff, applied the principles set out in Malco Engineering Pty Ltd v Ferreira (1994) 10 NSWCCR 117. At [221] McColl JA explained that this was because of the ""uncertainty"" of what happened, arising from the plaintiff's inability to remember, as opposed to evidence of lying:

""The uncertainty as to what had happened to the respondent, particularly when seen in the context of the primary judge's adverse credit findings made it essential to assess the rest of his evidence in the manner Handley JA indicated in Malco Engineering v Ferreira. This was not a case, like Malco Engineering v Ferreira, where the primary judge had concluded the respondent had committed perjury in the course of the proceedings""

141McColl JA particularly noted (at [225]) the danger, in such a case, of placing too much weight on earlier, and apparently internally consistent accounts of the accident, which were then in conflict with the plaintiff's later evidence:

""The other evidence the primary judge considered (at [324] ff) supported the respondent's version that there were three ""early"" consistent accounts that he believed he was struck by a motor vehicle. Each of those documents was prepared by the respondent as part of his claim either for workers compensation benefits or for damages arising from the 5 September 2000 incident. Each was prepared contemporaneously with the respondent's preparation of other documents the primary judge had found contained deliberate lies for the purpose of securing financial advantage. His Honour's reasons did not expose why the accounts in those documents were not tainted by the adverse credit findings. Indeed, his Honour appears to have quarantined those findings from affecting these documents in the manner Handley JA criticised in Malco Engineering v Ferreira. It is not possible to discern from his Honour's reasons the careful assessment called for in the circumstances of a case which depended substantially for its success on acceptance of the respondent's version of events.""

142Thirdly, McColl JA warned against too ready an assumption that lies told by a witness meant that the account of the accident was itself a lie:

""Further, in my view, as in Brown v Harding, the primary judge's conclusion that the respondent had, in substance, lied on many occasions over a period which spanned 12 or so years, including the period of the incident, to secure financial advantage, was in conflict with his conclusion (at [324]) that the respondent's ""early"" consistent accounts of the incident were ""credible and supportive of the inference that he was struck by a vehicle"". The respondent's propensity to lie about such matters had to be taken into account in determining why the three documents the primary judge relied upon should be accepted. Merely to say the documents were ""early"" and ""consistent"" begged the question as to whether they were any more credible than the documents in respect of which the respondent had been found to have engaged in deceptive conduct. In my view the appellant has established that the primary judge failed to use or palpably misused his advantage as a trial judge in finding in the respondent's favour.""

143These proceedings were remitted to this court for rehearing and the plaintiff was again unsuccessful: McLennan v Nominal Defendant [2014] NSWCA 332. While the appeal was dismissed because of failure to carry out due search and inquiry (per Basten JA at [20], noting the plaintiff's account of the accident as ""on one view...implausible"") and the judge did not determine the issue on credit findings (at [60]), the court was not critical of the second trial judge's acceptance of the same inconsistencies in the plaintiff's account of the accident to medical practitioners (at [63] - [64]). 

144The issue in these proceedings is, however, not the general issue of credit, but the question of how to deal with two different accounts both of the reporting of the accident to the police and of the circumstances of the accident itself. Counsel for the defendant has drawn my attention to McColl JA's reference in McLennan v Nominal Defendant to Malco Engineering v Ferreira, and submits that the plaintiff has lied in her testimony on issues central to the factual matrix of these proceedings.

145Counsel for the defendant draws to my attention the fact that all police and hospital records contemporaneous with the accident fail to refer to the near-collision with the white Toyota, and asks me to conclude that the plaintiff has lied in her account of the circumstances of the accident, which in fact occurred in the circumstances described by Mr Delalande, namely in circumstances where the defendant is not liable, not only due to lack of negligence but because the plaintiff was not riding on a public road.

146Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that I had ""the direct sworn evidence of a 22 year old member of the community"" (T 254) whose sworn testimony should not be underestimated. The hospital and police records tendered did not amount to evidence from other witnesses, but to information (or lack of information) provided by the plaintiff, and as such had less weight than the testimony of other witnesses. The court would be unaware of what questions were asked to elicit that information, or even if the information in question was obtained by the plaintiff (T 255 - 6). This information ""could have come from a worker at the hospital that had been given to her by someone"" (T 257). 

147Mr Quickenden pointed out that the Court of Appeal has repeatedly urged judges to regard hospital and police reports with the utmost caution, for the reasons explained by Basten JA in Mason v Demasi [2009] NSWCA 227 at [2]:

""[2] First, the trial judge was invited to discount the appellant's oral testimony on the basis of accounts given to various health professionals, which appeared inconsistent either with each other, or with her oral testimony, or both. The difficulties attending this kind of exercise should be well-understood; as explained in the Container Terminals Australia Ltd v Huseyin [2008] NSWCA 320 at [8], such apparent inconsistencies may, and often should, be approached with caution for the following reasons, amongst others:

(a) the health professional who took the history has not been cross-examined about:

(i) the circumstances of the consultation;

(ii) the manner in which the history was obtained;

(iii) the period of time devoted to that exercise, and

(iv) the accuracy of the recording;

(b) the fact that the history was probably taken in furtherance of a purpose which differed from the forensic exercise in the course of which it was being deployed in the proceedings;

(c) the record did not identify any questions which may have elucidated replies;

(d) the record is likely to be a summary prepared by the health professional, rather than a verbatim recording, and

(e) a range of factors, including fluency in English, the professional's knowledge of the background circumstances of the incident and the patient's understanding of the purpose of the questioning, which will each affect the content of the history.

[3] The fact that, in the present case, none of the health professionals was called to give oral evidence as to the matters in issue may not itself be a point of significance. It is unlikely that cross-examination would have advanced any issue in dispute; the witness being likely to have no relevant recollection of taking the history, the oral testimony would be largely limited to an assertion of usual practice.

[4] Thirdly, and more significantly, it was quite possible that the elements of florid expression and exaggeration in the applicant's oral testimony (and in some of the recorded histories) may have been a function of her psychological state. This was not something that the trial judge could readily assess without expert assistance, but it was a possibility that should not have been ignored. On one view, the pre-attack records (particularly the notes of Dr Hamad) were devoid of the flamboyant language found in post-attack accounts.""

148The following may be noted:

(a)The notes of both hospitals, which have been created independently of each other, are consistent over almost a two-week period;

(b)The absence of notation of complaint to the police the day following the accident, a document created independently to the hospital records, is consistent with there having been no reported unidentified vehicle;

(c)The plaintiff's ability to give a coherent account of events appears to be supported by references to her mental and physical state; and

(d)The accuracy of the other information in these documents is not challenged.

149Additionally, there is the evidence of Mr Delalande. Mr Quickenden put it to me that even if the plaintiff was part of what Mr Quickenden called ""that ruse"", that does not mean that she was not telling the truth about how the accident occurred. There was no evidence to contradict the plaintiff as to where and in what circumstances the accident occurred, and her mother's evidence (and, to a limited degree, that of Mr Delalande) supported that evidence, which was sufficient corroboration (T 259 - 60).

150Ms Allan's submissions were that I would not accept the plaintiff, her mother or Mr Delalande as witnesses of credit, because of the acknowledged inconsistencies in circumstances where the alternate explanation of a ""ruse"" to avoid prosecution was not adopted by the plaintiff in any event. Additionally, Ms Allan pointed to a series of Court of Appeal decisions explaining the manner in which the court should approach evidence in claims against the Nominal Defendant, where evidence was by definition lacking, in that the vehicle which caused the accident, and its driver, were almost always unknown.

Negligence and the Nominal Defendant

151How should the trial judge approach the evaluation of evidence in proceedings against the Nominal Defendant, where evidence from the driver of the unknown vehicle (and often of witnesses to the accident) is not available? Are the issues the same, or are there additional matters which should be taken into account? As is set out below, the same issues arise, although the factual issues may be different. For example, rather than competing versions of the accident by both the driver and the injured person, the court may have to determine whether to accept one or the other (or none) of one or more accounts of the accident in circumstances where the evidence of witnesses is either nonexistent or limited. There may be more than one alternative put forward to explain the plaintiff's injuries, and the question is how these alternatives should be assessed, and whether the judge should, in the absence of the burden of proof being discharged, decline to accept either theory: Guest v The Nominal Defendant [2006] NSWCA 77). 

152A cautious approach should be taken to the determination of negligence issues where the Nominal Defendant is a party: Dimovski v GIO (NSW) (1995) 21 MVR 288. In Dimovski (at 291), the Court of Appeal noted that there may be ""circumstances where a judge may not be satisfied that an accident happened in the manner asserted by the plaintiff even though there is no contradictory evidence in the case"". Similar caution has been expressed in decisions in other jurisdictions of Australia: Hofer v Miller (1957) SASR 41; Freeman v Griffiths (1976) 13 SASR 494.

153This is particularly the case where there is conflicting evidence as to how the plaintiff's injuries occurred. In Dimovski v GIO (NSW) the Court of Appeal went on (at 291) to refer to Askarou v Nominal Defendant (NSW) (1989) 8 MVR 491), as an example of ""evidentiary material which contradicts, in material respects, a plaintiff's version of an accident or the circumstances surrounding an accident"". There was no absence of evidence in that case, in that the plaintiff was a pillion passenger and there was also evidence from a witness; however, the trial judge did not accept their evidence and found for the defendant. 

154In dismissing the appeal, Clarke JA explained how this result was an example of the reasoning process necessary where the defendant is the nominal defendant, whose inability to call evidence from witnesses to the accident requires the trial judge to evaluate the evidence with care: 

""I should add that in this case there is a perfectly good explanation why the evidence of the plaintiff and her witnesses was not contradicted by other evidence. That explanation lies in the identity of the nominal defendant. As I pointed out, he represents, in a sense, the driver of the unidentified motor vehicle and the obvious consequence is there is usually no competing version available. 
The inability of the nominal defendant to call evidence from witnesses to the accident necessarily requires a trial judge to evaluate, with some care, the evidence which has been given in order to determine whether he can accept it. What occurred in this case was an example of that process. Judge Torrington analysed in detail and with some care the problems which were created by the totality of the evidence given in the case and concluded in the ultimate that he was unable to accept the versions of witnesses. This course was, in my opinion, perfectly open to him."" 

155An greater problem arises where the plaintiff's own evidence suggests alternate explanations for the injuries. This was the case in the two hearings and appeals in McLennan v Nominal Defendant [2010] NSWDC 28; Nominal Defendant v McLennan [2012] NSWCA 148; McLennan v Nominal Defendant [2014] NSWCA 332, where the competing versions for the injuries were either the plaintiff had been hit by a car while in the car park, or he had been assaulted by a known enemy. The first trial judge, Levy SC DCJ, did not accept the plaintiff's evidence on credit grounds, principally based on the plaintiff's contemporaneous description of the accident to hospital staff. This finding was set aside and the proceedings referred to the District Court for rehearing. 

156In the second hearing, the trial judge, Garling ADCJ stated:

""I have two conflicting inferences, both strong, both competing. If I have to pick one I would feel that he was probably struck by a motor vehicle. But there are still two very much competing inferences and even if I find he was struck by a motor vehicle, ... I am not satisfied there was any negligence. I simply do not know what happened. I do not know other than, if he was struck by a motor vehicle, he was struck from behind and I know where he was laying [sic: scilicet lying]. Anything could have happened in [the period from when Mr McLennan put on his jacket after getting out of the car until he awoke on his left side between two cars].""

([2014] NSWCA 332 at [79]; emphasis added by Emmett JA)

157Is it necessary for the trial judge to accept one version of events and reject the other, or even to arrive at a third version? At [86] the Court stated:

""A court is not authorised to choose between guesses, where the possibilities are not unlimited, on the ground that one guess seems more likely than another or the others. The facts proved must form a reasonable basis for a definite conclusion affirmatively drawn of the truth of which the tribunal of fact may reasonably be satisfied (Guest v The Nominal Defendant [2006] NSWCA 77 at [108], citing Jones v Dunkel[1959] HCA 8; 101 CLR 298 at 304-5).""

158 In Guest v The Nominal Defendant the plaintiff, who was inebriated, was found unconscious on the roadside with ""extremely unusual"" (at [17]) injuries, including castration. The question was whether he had been struck by a motor vehicle or the victim of an assault. The plaintiff had no recollection of what had happened (Handley JA noted at [99] that there were no credit findings); instead, the parties called experts as to the how the injuries could have been suffered.

159The court (by majority) concluded that the trial judge, Sidis DCJ, rightly held that the plaintiff did not discharge the onus upon him. It was not necessary for the trial judge to prefer one theory over another, or to seek to reconcile the evidence to determine a third possibility (see also McLennan v Nominal Defendant [2014] NSWCA 332 at [86] - [91]).

160Firstly, there is the question of whether the plaintiff's version should be accepted in circumstances where there is a real likelihood that she has lied to the court about the circumstances of the accident: where it occurred, whether her boyfriend was present, what speed she was travelling at, and whether another car was involved.. Secondly, even if I accept the plaintiff's version, has negligence been established?

161In answer to the first of these questions, when determining the competing versions, I should take into account my findings that neither the plaintiff or her witnesses are persons whose evidence should be accepted without corroboration from a witness of credit. The facts of this case are stronger than Guest v The Nominal Defendant or McLennan v The Nominal Defendant, in that, in those cases, the possibilities of alternative explanations for the plaintiff's accident were supposition based on the nature of the injuries and/or conflicting accounts to medical practitioners and of a hypothetical nature, where the plaintiff could not recall what had happened. In the present case, consistent accounts by the plaintiff to the two hospitals providing treatment, over a period of time, are in conflict with her evidence in this court. 

162Secondly, even if I were to accept the plaintiff's version of the accident, has she established that her injuries were occasioned by the negligence of the unknown driver?

163In Guest v The Nominal Defendant the Court of Appeal accepted the trial judge's finding that, if the plaintiff's injuries were caused by a motor vehicle, the onus of proof had not been discharged. Has the plaintiff discharged that burden here?

164Mr Quickenden put to me that the facts spoke for themselves, in that ""something happened"" on the roadway, with the result that the plaintiff was forced off the road by the negligence of the unknown white Toyota. Ms Allan submitted that the plaintiff had not discharged the onus of proof and that her lack of credibility on other issues meant that her uncorroborated version of events should not be accepted.

165On the plaintiff's version, two vehicles in the roadway came within collision range and the plaintiff swerved to avoid this. The same vision obstacle would have been apparent to each. The position of the vehicles when this occurred is unknown. Even if the plaintiff had been travelling at 60 kilometres an hour, her small trail bike would have been hard for the motorist to see (especially without lights). 

166In Nesterczuk v Mortimer (1965) 115 CLR 140, where one vehicle struck another a glancing blow, Owen J (at 155) described the apportionment of liability as ""a mere guess"". Windeyer J said at 154:

""Doubtless the facts spoke for themselves, and eloquently, of negligence: but of whose negligence they had nothing convincing to say.""

167Independently of my adverse credit findings, and my findings that the plaintiff suffered an injury while riding with her boyfriend in circumstances not involving a white Toyota Corolla, the plaintiff cannot discharge the burden of proof. As an 18-year-old unlicensed driver, unfamiliar with the road rules and riding on the road illegally, the plaintiff responded to seeing another vehicle on the roadway, which she thought might strike her trail bike, by veering off the road. The plaintiff has not discharged the burden, even if the accident occurred more or less in the manner that she claimed, that this vehicle was at fault. If any of the additional factual material in the hospital notes was correct (such as that she was travelling at 80 kilometres per hour), the burden of proof becomes even more difficult to discharge. 

168As was the case in Guest v Nominal Defendant (where credit was not an issue), the plaintiff has failed to prove that the other vehicle, for which the defendant is liable, was negligent. 

169Alternatively, it is necessary for me to make a finding that the plaintiff (and Mrs French and Mr Delalande) have all been less than frank in their evidence and, in the case of the plaintiff, given the court an untruthful account of how the accident occurred. The true version, I am satisfied, was the version the plaintiff gave to the hospitals treating her in the two weeks following the accident.

170Although I have found in favour of the defendant, I shall make short observations as to contributory negligence, due inquiry and search, and quantum. 

Contributory negligence

171In view of my findings on liability, I shall deal with this issue briefly.

172The plaintiff was illegally riding a trail bike on the road, without headlights. She told the hospital she was travelling at about 80 kilometres an hour, although she told the court that she was travelling 60 kilometres an hour. The motorist's vision, like her own, was obstructed by the mound or ridge which blocked her view of the oncoming car until the last minute.

173Ms Allan put the percentage of contributory negligence at 30%. Mr Quickenden did not put a figure, and submitted that any allowance for contributory negligence, if made, would be minimal.

174If I have erred in my findings as to negligence, I would accept Ms Allan's assessment of 30%.

Due inquiry and search

175Sections 34 and 34A Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) provide:

""34 Claim against Nominal Defendant where vehicle not identified

(1) An action for the recovery of damages in respect of the death of or injury to a person caused by the fault of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle on a road in New South Wales may, if the identity of the vehicle cannot be established, be brought against the Nominal Defendant.

(1AA) A claim cannot be made against the Nominal Defendant under this section unless due inquiry and search has been made to establish the identity of the motor vehicle concerned.

(1A) If the motor accident resulting in the death of or injury to a person occurred on land that is a road related area within the meaning of section 4 (1) of the Road Transport Act 2013 because it is an area that is open to or used by the public for driving, riding or parking vehicles, there is no right of action against the Nominal Defendant under this section if at the time of the motor accident the person was a trespasser on the land.

(2) The inquiry or search may be proved orally or by affidavit of the person who made the inquiry or search.

(3) In respect of any such action, the Nominal Defendant is liable as if it were the owner or driver of the motor vehicle.

34A Rejection of claim for failure to make due inquiry and search to establish identity of vehicle

(1) If due inquiry and search has not been made to establish the identity of the motor vehicle concerned, a claim against the Nominal Defendant under section 34 cannot be referred for assessment under Part 4.4 unless:

(a) the Nominal Defendant has lost the right to reject the claim for failure to make that due inquiry and search, or

(b) a claims assessor has, on the assessment of a dispute as to whether the claim may be rejected for failure to make that due inquiry and search, assessed that due inquiry and search has been made, or

(c) the claim is referred only for a certificate of exemption from assessment under Part 4.4.

(2) The Nominal Defendant loses the right to reject a claim for failure to make due inquiry and search to establish the identity of a vehicle if the Nominal Defendant:

(a) does not, within 2 months after the claim is made, reject the claim for failure to make that due inquiry and search or ask the claimant to make that due inquiry and search, or

(b) does not, within 2 months after being notified of efforts to establish the identity of the vehicle, refuse to accept that there has been due inquiry and search to establish the identity of the vehicle.

(3) If court proceedings are commenced on a claim against the Nominal Defendant under section 34, the Nominal Defendant may apply to the court to have the proceedings dismissed on the ground that due inquiry and search to establish the identity of the vehicle has not been made.

(4) An application to have proceedings dismissed on that ground cannot be made more than 2 months after the statement of claim is served on the Nominal Defendant and also cannot be made if the Nominal Defendant has lost the right to reject the claim on that ground.

(5) On an application to have proceedings dismissed on that ground, the court must dismiss the proceedings unless satisfied that due inquiry and search to establish the identity of the vehicle has been made.""

176It is not in dispute that the relevant rejection was not provided. The question is whether, in those circumstances, the defence can be raised at trial, and whether the provision of false or misleading information can in some way vitiate the failure to challenge whether due inquiry and search occurred. 

The correspondence

177The plaintiff engaged private investigators in an attempt to locate persons who might have information regarding the accident in the circumstances alleged by the plaintiff (Exhibit G). 

178On 22 December 2010, the Nominal Defendant wrote to the plaintiff's solicitors as follows (Exhibit H):

""We refer to your client's Personal Injury Claim Form received by our office on 08/12/2010. We note your client alleges the vehicle at fault in the above motor accident is unidentified.

Pursuant to Section 34 of the Motor Accident Compensation Act, please provide details of due search and inquiry including:

1. What steps were taken to identify the vehicle

2. By whom

3. Dates these steps were undertaken

4. The results of these inquiries

Please note liability will not be determined until your client's due inquiry and search has been established.""

179In a letter dated 12 January 2011 (Exhibit J), the plaintiff's solicitors sent the following reply to the claims consultant acting for the Nominal Defendant:

""We refer to your correspondence dated 22 December 2010.

As requested we provide the following details with respect to due search and enquiry:- [sic]

1. What Steps Were Taken to Identify the Vehicle

a. The accident was reported to Police;

b. An advertisement was placed in the local newspaper, The Newcastle and Hunter Editions of the Newcastle Post about the accident asking for any witnesses to the accident to contact ourselves;

c. An investigator was commissioned to canvass residents in the vicinity of the accident site to see if they had witnessed the accident and were able to provide any particulars in relation to the vehicle alleged at fault.

2. By Whom

a. Our client and her mother;

b. Ourselves;

c. Mistique Enterprises Pty. Limited.

3. Dates These Steps Were Taken

a. Initially by the Claimant's mother on the 1300 police assistance number the following day of the accident and then by the Claimant in person on 19 November, 2010 at the Tuggerah Lakes Police Station;

b. 1 December, 2010 in the Newcastle and Hunter Editions of the Newcastle Post;

c. 9 November, 2010.

4. The Results of These Enquiries

a. As far as we are aware the subsequent police investigation has not lead to the subject car being identified;

b. We have received no response to the newspaper advertisement we placed requesting that any persons witnessing the accident contact us;

c. None of the residents in the vicinity of the accident site canvassed by the investigator we retained in the matter, were able to provide any information about the accident or the identity of the alleged vehicle at fault."" 

180This letter contains the claim that the accident was reported to police the day after it occurred. As is set out above, I am satisfied that this did not occur. This means that the determination by the defendant of whether due inquiry was made proceeded on an erroneous basis. No information is recorded in the police notebook about the accident and, not surprisingly, no inquiries were made by police subsequent to visiting the plaintiff's home on the day following the accident, which I am satisfied occurred solely because the bikes belonging to the plaintiff and to Mr Delalande were reported to them as stolen. Additionally, the defendant was not informed that the bike the plaintiff was riding at the time of the accident was reported stolen the following day. 

181The Nominal Defendant did, however, obtain the Wyong Hospital notes, and realised that the version of the accident given to the hospital was entirely different to the account of the accident given to its office. On 11 March 2011, the Nominal Defendant wrote to the plaintiff's solicitors as follows (Exhibit 17):

""We refer to the above matter and Wyong hospital Notes that you have served on us in relation to the claimant.

A perusal of those notes reveals that the claimant gave narratives in relation to her descriptions of the circumstances of how the accident occurred. It is clear that the accident did not occur so as to entitle her to make a claim.

We invite you to reassess the liability issue in this matter and we request that after such reassessment, your client withdraw this claim.

We bring to your attention the provisions of Section 118 of MACA 1999. We expect a response within 14 days of the receipt of this letter.""

182The plaintiff's solicitors replied, on 4 April 2011, (Exhibit 17) as follows:

""We refer to your correspondence dated 11 March, 2011.

We are aware of these narratives that you are referring to and have raised them previously with our client. Her instructions are, which she has reaffirmed, that the reference to a mate's car is a misinterpretation of her referring to the driver of the subject vehicle colloquially as ""old mate"" and that her boyfriend, (and indeed the first time she saw him that day was when he attended upon the hospital after being contacted by the claimant's mother and advised what happened) or any other bike rider was not in the vicinity of the accident.

Our client has advised that there were three other bike riders in accidents in her ward on that day. It may also be that an error in the narratives recorded has occurred as a result of this.""

183The defendant tendered the hospital records for the other patients in the ward. None of them were injured in the circumstances described by the plaintiff. Whether or not the plaintiff generally referred to male persons of a certain age as ""old mate"" cannot, however, explain the much longer interview she and her mother gave to the Royal North Shore Hospital, which included not only intimate details of the plaintiff's personal life but the same description of the circumstances of the accident.

184Counsel for the parties confined their submissions as to whether, by failing to make the objection within the two-month period, but did not take me to any authority on this issue. It may be that there is none. In Parker v Nominal Defendant [2013] NSWDC 15 Levy SC DCJ held (at [24]) that failure to do so within the 2 month period meant that the Nominal Defendant lost the right to bring an application for dismissal. 

185Is it inconsistent to hold that the summary dismissal right is lost but the right to raise the issue at the trial remains? Is the legislation aimed only at summary applications? There is nothing in the statutory language to this effect.

186In Parker v Nominal Defendant Levy SC DCJ went on, notwithstanding the dismissal of the summary judgment application for lack of due and proper inquiry, to make formal findings of fact. I propose to follow the same course.

187I am satisfied that, contrary to the information given to the defendant, the plaintiff did not notify the police until November 2010, as opposed to the day after the accident. While Mr Quickenden put to me that this was only a few months after the accident, the Nominal Defendant was misled by this information, and by the explanation given by the plaintiff for the contents of the Wyong Hospital notes. It would have been on the basis of these answers provided by the plaintiff's solicitors that the rejection of the claim referred to in the correspondence was not proceeded with.

188The purpose of the due search and inquiry provision is to assist the Nominal Defendant to investigate all aspects of the claim promptly: see the discussion of Blandford v Fox 45 SR (NSW) 241 at 254 and Harrison v Nominal Defendant (1975) 7 ALR 680 by Greenwood J in Rehn v Nominal Defendant (Supreme Court of New South Wales, 9 April 1990), holding that a report to police two months after the accident, and subsequent newspaper advertisements, were insufficient. Whether the ""due"" element is satisfied is what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances: Cavanagh v Nominal Defendant (1958) 100 CLR 375 at 380 - 1 per Dixon CJ. 

189The misleading and inaccurate information provided by the plaintiff meant that the defendant could not carry out a proper search. In particular, the plaintiff's answers concerning the Wyong Hospital notes were not honest. If it were open to me to make such a finding I would find that the due inquiry and search requirement has not been made, but I remain of the view that Levy SC DCJ's interpretation is correct.

190The statute is silent as to what should occur if inconsistent evidence is uncovered at trial where no issue had previously been taken to due inquiry and search, in that the plaintiff's statements as to when and in what circumstances the accident occurred was accepted, but later found to be wrong or untrue. That may be an appropriate matter for statutory amendment.

$192,055.95

192While the plaintiff was not employed in the strict sense prior to the accident, she had accepted an offer of employment which she was able to take up, approximately two months after the accident. I do not accept her claim that she was unable to perform day shift duties; the evidence on her employment record shows that she has been working only after the accident, and at all relevant times on night duty.

193The plaintiff has a substantial and serious deformity of her leg in the form of scarring which I am satisfied would make a significant impact on her life as well as causing pain. The award of non-economic loss should take this into account. The amount proposed by the defendant ($130,000) adequately reflects such a loss.

Past and future out of pocket expenses

194Past and future out of pocket expenses are agreed.

Past and future economic loss and superannuation

195Past economic loss and superannuation are agreed.

196As to future economic loss, the plaintiff gave widely differing accounts of the impact of her injury to medical practitioners. Some of these are:

(a)She told the staff at the Royal North Shore Hospital, during her stay in that hospital between 2 - 12 July, that she was supposed to be starting her first day at work while she was there;

(b)She told Dr Walker (see page 1 of his report dated 28 February 2012) that she had been ""working for 18 months in the job 72 - 80 hours every two weeks"" and that she had 5 months off work due to her injuries, following which she was put on light duties at night, as she could not manage the day shift. She gave a different version again of her work history to Dr Conrad.

197As is set out above, the plaintiff in examination-in-chief painted a picture of being unable to perform her pre-injury work duties and as having gradually got back to full time work, albeit on night shift where the work load was lighter, over the past four years. In the course of cross-examination the plaintiff agreed:

(a)She had not commenced work until after the accident (T 54);

(b)The histories she gave to the Review Panel, Craig Martin, Dr Walker and Dr Conrad were incorrect (T 56 - 7);

(c)She returned to her duties two months after the accident (T 58) and had not had extensive time off work as she had told the doctors (T 61);

(d)She had not been on day shift before the accident (T 58);

(e)She had not been on restricted duties (T 59);

(f)The description of her work duties involved frequent forward bending and looking down, making beds and other activities which she had stated were difficult and/or caused her pain (T 59 - 61);

(g)She had lodged a claim for injuries involved in lifting patients, and her job description referred to lifting weights of 10 kilograms (T 61).

198Although two warning letters were tendered, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has the capacity for full time employment and that only a small cushion for future economic loss should be allowed. I accordingly would accept the figure proposed by the defendant.

199In doing so, I should note that I have not accepted that the plaintiff has established a case for loss of a chance of a career. In the course of her evidence the plaintiff said her hope had been to enter the defence forces or the police force. The plaintiff told the court she had obtained her school certificate, but she told Dr Smoleniec on 29 November 2012 that she ""struggled academically"" in high school and left in Year 10 (Exhibit Q); this was not, however, the subject of cross-examination, so I must treat this inconsistency with caution. 

200However, the plaintiff agreed that she had failed the entrance examination for the defence forces, although she said she hoped to try again when she was more mature. Dr Robin Higgs, in his supplementary report of 12 May 2014 (Exhibit A) comments:

""It is interesting to observe that Ms Buggy did not advise me of her intention to apply for admission to a [sic] Police Force and/or the Australian Defence Force. Interestingly the lady is not terribly sportive. She does not now play any sport although she has previously played Soccer.

I have reviewed all of the literature that you have made available to me and I have formed the conclusion that Ms Buggy is probably unfit for service in a [sic] Police force or in a Military Unit. My review of the literature has caused me to have considerable doubts as to whether Ms Buggy would be able to pass all of those fitness tests that are involved.""

201The Vocational Guidance Report, however, assessed her as having an 85% possibility of working as a police officer and a 90% chance of working in the Defence Force, despite failing the examination. The reasoning behind these percentages is not exposed and this must diminish the value of these reports to vanishing point. The plaintiff's own evidence was that she failed the Defence Force examination and was not accepted back to take a second test. 

Paid past and future care

202The plaintiff clearly required care and assistance for the two months prior to commencing employment. She received voluntary assistance from her mother. This falls below the threshold.

203The plaintiff's work duties on night shift show that she is capable of a wide range of activities. Not only was she capable of full time work about two months after the accident, but her mother left her for nearly two months at the end of 2010 to perform work duties in Christmas Island. It would appear, from the contents of Mrs French's general practitioner's notes, that Mrs French is required to work overseas at regular intervals. While Mrs French denied that these trips had occurred (apart from the 2010 trip), I prefer to accept the accuracy of her general practitioner's reports. This is indicative of the plaintiff being able to care for herself.

204There is no doubt that Mr Grant has been cutting the lawn at Mrs French's home for some years. However, I am satisfied, from his observations of the plaintiff on occasion using the whipper-snipper, that the plaintiff is capable of cutting the lawns and attending to garden chores if called upon to do so. 

205I would accordingly not make any allowance for past or future care.

Orders

(1)Judgment for the defendant.

(2)Plaintiff pay defendant's costs.

(3)Liberty to apply in relation to costs.

1THE COURT: On a joint indictment presented on 23 February 2011, Lachlan Wilson, DS (the appellant), Ibrahim Jidah, Yousef Jidah and Ryan Kapral were charged with a range of what might be described broadly as drug offences. ES, another person also involved in the alleged offences, pleaded guilty.

2The charges against the appellant alleged contraventions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1983 (NSW) (the DMT Act) and the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Code). The charges were as follows:

""Count 3

Between about 4 August 2008 and 13 August 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did import into Australia a substance, namely a commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine, a border controlled precursor, intending to use, or believing that another person intended to use any of that substance to manufacture a controlled drug, in that he did aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of that offence by Lachlan WILSON.

Contrary to ss. 307.11(1) with 11.2(1) Criminal Code

Count 4

Between about 4 August 2008 and 14 August 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did supply a prohibited drug, namely pseudoephedrine, being not less than the commercial quantity and not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to pseudoephedrine.

Contrary to s.25(2) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 

Count 5

Between about 4 August 2008 and 14 August 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did attempt to possess a precursor, namely pseudoephedrine, intended for use in the manufacture or production by [DS] or another person of a prohibited drug.

Contrary to s. 24A(1) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act.""

3Following a trial before Judge Frearson SC and a jury, the appellant was convicted on Counts 4 and 5. The jury was unable to agree on Count 3 and was subsequently discharged. 

4The appellant was sentenced on Count 4 to a non-parole period of 10 years 4 months and 1 week with an additional term of 5 years and 7 months (that is a head sentence of 15 years 11 months and 1 week imprisonment expiring on 24 February 2027). On Count 5 he was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment to be served wholly concurrently with the sentence imposed for Count 4.

5The appellant has appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against his sentence.

6Lachlan Wilson, Ibrahim Jidah, Yousef Jidah and ES were convicted of various offences relating to the same drugs as those the subject of the charges against the appellant and their appeals, with the exception of that of ES (on sentence), were heard at the same time as this appeal.

The relevant legislation
7Section 25(2) of the DMT Act provides as follows:

""25(2) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.""

8""Supply"" is defined in s 3 of the DMT Act in the following terms:

""supply includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things.""

9""Prohibited drug"" is defined in s 3 of the DMT Act as any substance other than a prohibited plant specified in Sch 1. Pseudoephedrine is specified in Sch 1. A large commercial quantity of that drug is 5.0 kg.

10Section 33(3) of the DMT Act provides that the maximum penalty for s 25(2), where the offence involved not less than the large commercial quantity, is life imprisonment, a fine of 5,000 penalty units or both. The standard non-parole period is 15 years imprisonment.

11Section 24A of the DMT Act so far as relevant provides as follows:

""24A(1) A person who has possession of: 

(a) a precursor, or

(b) a drug manufacture apparatus,

intended by the person for use in the manufacture or production, by that person or another person, of a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.

...

(3) In this section: 

drug manufacture apparatus means an apparatus specified or described in the regulations as a drug manufacture apparatus for the purposes of this section.

precursor means a substance specified or described in the regulations as a precursor for the purposes of this section.""

12Pseudoephedrine is specified in Sch 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Regulation 2011 (NSW) as a precursor for the purpose of section 24A of the DMT Act.

13Section 33AB of the DMT Act provides that the maximum penalty for an offence under s 24A is a fine of 2,000 penalty units or imprisonment for 10 years or both.

Factual background 
14The facts relating to the charges against the appellant are set out in our judgment in the appeal of Lachlan Wilson (Lachlan Wilson v R [2014] NSWCCA 266 at [13]-[114]), particularly at [100]-[114] and it is not necessary to repeat them. 

The conviction appeal
15The appellant appealed against his conviction on the sole ground that the trial miscarried because the appellant was charged with inconsistent verdicts. However, during the course of the hearing of the appeal the appellant was granted leave to amend this ground of appeal in the following terms:

""On the facts of this case the conviction of the appellant on both Counts 4 and 5 have led to a miscarriage of justice because the elements of Count 4 are contained in the elements of Count 5.""

16The relief sought was that the conviction under Count 4 or Count 5 be quashed.

The submissions
17The appellant adopted the submissions made on behalf of Yousef Jidah on his appeal. The Crown also relied on the submissions made in that appeal (see Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270 at [17]-[33]).

Disposition
18This appeal raises the same issues as those in the appeal of Yousef Jidah. For the reasons given in that appeal (Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270 at [34]-[58]), the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

The sentence appeal
19The application for leave to appeal against sentence is effectively limited to the sentence imposed for Count 4 (the supply count). For that offence, a sentence of 15 years 11 months and 1 week was imposed, comprised of a non-parole period of 10 years 4 months and 1 week and a balance of term of 5 years and 7 months against a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. Sentence was imposed on 27 July 2012 and took account of broken periods of pre-sentence custody. His Honour made a finding of special circumstances. 

20The jury was unable to agree as to the appellant's guilt on Count 3. (The jury were also unable to agree that Lachlan Wilson, a co-accused at the appellant's trial, was the importer of the pseudoephedrine, see Lachlan Wilson v R [2014] NSWCCA 266.) His Honour accepted, for sentencing purposes, that nothing the appellant did in supplying the pseudoephedrine (as a prohibited drug contrary to s 25 of the DMT Act) or attempting to possess it (as a precursor contrary to s 24A(1) of the DMT Act) was conduct directed to aiding and abetting the importation of the pseudoephedrine (as a border controlled precursor) or that the appellant intended that his conduct might have that effect.

21Three grounds of appeal are relied upon: 

(1)His Honour failed to take into account the period of substantial delay between the commission of the offence and the sentencing of the appellant; 

(2)The sentence was in breach of the principle of parity; and 

(3)The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

The facts found for sentencing purposes 
22The appellant was the last of a number of co-offenders involved in and sentenced for the importation, supply and attempted possession of the pseudoephedrine. In his Honour's reasons for sentencing this appellant, his Honour referred to the fact that the context in which the appellant's offending was to be assessed had been set out repeatedly in the sentencing reasons published in respect of the co-offenders. The facts have also been set out at very considerable length in the appeal against conviction by Lachlan Wilson at [13]-[114] and particularly, so far as this appellant is concerned, at [100]-[114] (Lachlan Wilson v R [2014] NSWCCA 266). The conviction appeals of Ibrahim Jidah and Yousef Jidah were considered in the context of the same facts (Ibrahim Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 269 and Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270).

23Having regard to the evidence led at trial, his Honour was satisfied that the appellant was aware of the pending arrival of the container in which the drugs were secreted, and that his role was to facilitate the delivery of the container to the warehouse, to supervise the unpacking of the container by those who were to attend to that task and to isolate the boxes containing the drugs to facilitate the delivery to others. His Honour also found the appellant's role was to supervise the resealing of the boxes after they had been examined with a view to locating any listening devices. 

24His Honour described the appellant's role as important, given the need for coordination and supervision of the arrangements essential to securing possession of the drugs for the purposes of on-supply. He also found that the appellant performed that role for a significant but unquantified financial reward. He did not consider the fact that the appellant performed his role for reward as a feature of aggravation, it being inherent in drug offending of this scale.

25In light of the appellant's role and, in particular, his manual handling of the boxes with a view to isolating those that he believed to contain the drugs, his Honour was satisfied that the appellant well knew the approximate gross quantity of pseudoephedrine. His Honour accepted that while the quantity of the drug supplied was not decisive, it was relevant to an assessment of the objective gravity of the appellant's offending.

26In considering the relative roles of the various co-offenders for parity purposes, his Honour considered that the appellant's role as an organiser, overseer and manager of the warehouse, was subordinate to ES's role, who, as principal, instructed and directed the activities of the appellant and others involved in the enterprise. His Honour accepted that ES was the person to whom the appellant reported after the container was cleared through Customs and after the boxes were unpacked. The appellant's role was also assessed as subordinate to Lachlan Wilson who was convicted of being knowingly concerned in the supply of the drugs, but senior to Yousef Jidah and Ibrahim Jidah, who were recruited to assist in transporting the drugs and who were convicted of the same offences as this appellant. 

The appellant's subjective circumstances 
27The appellant was aged 33 at the time of sentence. His Honour noted that he had a criminal record which, although relatively minor, disentitled him to the same measure of leniency as might be afforded a person with no criminal record. A number of references were tendered on sentence, including from his cousin, a member of the legal profession, and other family members who describe the appellant as subject to considerable influence exerted by ES. They also referred to his kind and generous disposition.

28His Honour also referred to a report from Dr John Jacmon, a consultant psychologist, which he found instructive insofar as it detailed the appellant's background. 

29Dr Jacmon reported that the appellant's day to day functioning was impaired by the effects of a post-traumatic stress disorder and by depression and anxiety at clinically significant levels. The post-traumatic stress disorder was thought likely to have arisen during the appellant's childhood and adolescence, as a result of suffering frequent abuse and violence perpetrated by his father, and witnessing the abuse of other family members. Dr Jacmon was also of the opinion that the appellant's various functional impairments were likely to diminish his ability to formulate reasoned judgments, causing him to act impulsively without giving appropriate consideration to the consequences of his actions. The same opinion was proffered by the same psychologist in a report tendered in ES's sentence proceedings (see ES v R [2014] NSWCCA 268 at [18]). 

30His Honour found that the evidence at trial, including the appellant's evidence (some of which his Honour considered to be patently untrue), did not support any suggestion that his conduct was impulsive. Rather, the enterprise involved a comprehensively planned and organised cooperative effort by many people, including the appellant. His Honour took into account the appellant's background as reported to the psychologist. In that regard, he noted the appellant was born in Lebanon and grew up on a rural property near Bathurst. His father had diabetes and, when he did not take his medication, was prone to frequent eruptions of violence. After moving with his family to Sydney the appellant completed Year 10. He then studied engineering at TAFE before taking up work in his father's takeaway food shop where he was required to work long hours. Thereafter he worked in a building company for a year and in 2008 set up his own waterproofing company. He was in a relationship of some long standing at the time of sentence. 

31His Honour regarded the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation as fair to good, being satisfied that he was unlikely to reoffend in the same way upon his release. There was no evidence of remorse.

Ground 1: His Honour failed to take into account the period of substantial delay between the commission of the offence and the sentencing of the appellant
32The appellant was convicted by the jury on 12 May 2011. He had spent two months in custody following his arrest on 14 August 2008 before being released to conditional bail. Bail was revoked on verdict.

33He was sentenced in July 2012, 2 months after Lachlan Wilson was sentenced, 10 months after Ibrahim Jidah and Yousef Jidah were sentenced and the day before ES was sentenced. It would appear that the delay of 14 months between verdict and sentence was due to the Crown initially notifying its intention to retry the appellant (and Lachlan Wilson) on the Commonwealth counts on the indictment (upon which the jury were unable to agree), jointly with ES, whose trial had been severed from the trial of the other co-offenders in February 2011. Consequent upon ES pleading guilty to aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring the importation of a commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine in February 2012, the Crown formally notified the appellant (and Lachlan Wilson) that they would not be retried and their respective sentence hearings were then convened.

34Neither the fact nor the extent of the delay, either between the offending and sentence or the verdict and sentence, was raised with the sentencing judge, and no submission was made that it had an impact on sentence. As Johnson J observed in Zreika v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [80]-[82], in sentencing appeals this Court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment in accordance with settled principles, not rehearing a plea in mitigation. A sentence appeal is not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case advanced on behalf of an offender before a sentencing court. This Court is entitled to expect that in a sentencing hearing an offender's legal representative will advance submissions by reference to the particular factors which are considered to operate in mitigation of sentence in order to allow the Crown the opportunity to address them and for the sentencing judge to give consideration to them. Subject to the relatively rare case where material has either not been presented on sentence or overlooked by either the parties or the sentencing judge, and where there is a risk of a serious injustice in the sentencing result as a consequence, this Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been advanced to the sentencing judge but were not (see Pym v R [2014] NSWCCA 182).

35Senior counsel for the appellant in this Court did not appear on sentence. He was unable to offer any satisfactory explanation as to why the issue of delay (assuming it was relevant) was not raised for the consideration of the sentencing judge as having any potential to impact upon the judge's assessment of the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation. Neither did he refer to any evidence tendered before the sentencing judge, which might have supported a submission that the delay should be considered by this Court to operate in mitigation of sentence in accordance with R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517. The mere fact that there was a delay, even of some years, between the commission of the offence and verdict, during which time the appellant was on bail, and between verdict and sentence, when he was not, is not, in itself, a mitigating factor. In this case, the delay between the appellant's arrest and trial was not unreasonable given the number of co-accused jointly tried and the factual matrix upon which proof of the Crown case at trial depended and the determination on the part of the Crown to endeavour to maintain the trial of all offenders as a joint trial. 

36The first ground of appeal is rejected. 

Ground 2: The sentence was in breach of the principle of parity
37The appellant complains that, despite his Honour's clear finding that ES was the principal in the importation (in which the appellant was involved as a supplier of the drug imported), and that the appellant was, in all respects, subordinate to ES, acting at his instruction and direction in his dealings with the container and its contents, a difference of 7 months between the appellant's sentence of 15 years 11 months and 1 week and ES's undiscounted sentence of 16 years and 6 months, when viewed objectively, gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.

38The principle of parity derives from the fundamental norm of equal justice. In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462, at [28] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, their Honours said of equal justice:

""It requires, so far as the law permits, that like cases be treated alike. Equal justice according to law also requires, where the law permits, differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law. As Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Wong v The Queen:

'Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect.'""
(References omitted).

39The sense of grievance complained of when the sentence for one offender is compared relative to that of a co-offender or co-offenders, is to be assessed objectively governed by considerations of substance rather than form. It is only triggered where differences in the sentences imposed on co-offenders is disproportionate to relevant distinctions in the role each played in the commission of the offence (even if the roles might be differently described or involve different conduct) and in an offender's subjective circumstances. There are necessarily degrees of both similarity and difference in the criminal conduct of co-offenders and in their subjective circumstances. In some cases this requires that different sentences be imposed. However, it is only where the discrepancy between sentences is not reasonably explained by the degree of difference between co-offenders and their offending that the disparity is such that appellate intervention is required. For there to be a justifiable sense of grievance, the disparity must be ""gross"", ""marked"" or ""glaring"" (see the discussion by Howie J in Crystal Lee England v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [61]-[67]).

40In Gill v R [2010] NSWCCA 236 at [58], McColl JA (with whom RS Hulme and Latham JJ agreed) observed that an applicant faces considerable obstacles in invoking the parity principle in circumstances where a sentence, said to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, was imposed by a sentencing judge who was aware of the sentences imposed on co-offenders and it is clear that the sentence is structured in that knowledge.

41In considering this appellant's complaint, that his sentence cannot be maintained given ES's senior role, there is the additional practical difficulty, recognised by the High Court in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen supra at [30], in comparing sentences imposed on participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different offences with different maximum penalties. 

42The High Court also recognised that the greater the difference between the offences, the greater the practical difficulties in ensuring that sentences reflect the principle of equal justice, particularly where disparity is said to arise from a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been sentenced for an offence that is less serious. If the difficulty identified by the High Court is to have any currency on this appeal, it is complicated by the fact that, although ES was sentenced against a maximum of 25 years imprisonment, while this appellant (and Lachlan Wilson) were sentenced against a statutory maximum of life imprisonment, ES's offending was, clearly, objectively more serious than this appellant's offending. In the appellant's case, there is the further legislative guidepost to an appropriate sentence that operates by reason of the standard non-parole period of 15 years while no standard non-parole period applies to the importation charge against ES, it being a Commonwealth offence.

43While, for those reasons, it is not possible to make a direct comparison between the sentence imposed on this appellant and that imposed upon ES and Lachlan Wilson, a meaningful comparison is possible. That task was undertaken by the sentencing judge, both in reflecting on the sentences imposed on Lachlan Wilson previously and on ES the previous day. His Honour made express reference to what he referred to as ""equal justice considerations"" and the hierarchy of roles within the enterprise while noting the incongruity in the charges preferred against this appellant and ES. 

44The subjective circumstances of DS and ES are different, but not to any material degree. As we have noted, while they both relied upon the same mental health review by the same psychologist, his Honour rejected any submission that their conduct was impulsive or a result of any compromised capacity for reasoned judgment (see ES v R [2014] NSWCCA 268 at [18]). They were both members of extended families and had sound employment histories as far as the evidence revealed. The sentencing judge was faced with a difficult sentencing task. We are satisfied, however, that after taking into account the different maximum sentences under the DMT Act and the Code, and the fact that the supply count attracts a standard non-parole period of 15 years, the differential of 7 months between ES's undiscounted sentence and the sentence imposed on this appellant and a differential of 3 months in the sentence imposed on Lachlan Wilson is unjustified. It fails to reflect the different, and more senior, roles of those two co-offenders and their significantly different criminal culpability and stake in the success of the operation. 

45Were we not persuaded that the ground of appeal alleging disparity was made out, we would not have intervened to re-sentence on the basis that the sentence imposed at first instance was manifestly excessive, in the sense of it being unreasonable or plainly unjust, after giving due weight to all relevant circumstances particular to this appellant's offending, including the maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

Re-sentence
46No materials were relied upon by the appellant on re-sentence. In that exercise, having regard to his Honour's factual findings and our own assessment of the gravity of the offending, in particular because of the weight of the drug involved, and its capacity to generate very significant profits in which the appellant was to share to some unquantified extent, a sentence of 14 years and 6 months, comprised of a non-parole period of 9 years and 6 months and an additional term of 5 years should be imposed. The ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term preserves the finding of special circumstances made by the sentencing judge.

Orders
47The Court makes the following orders:
(1)Appeal against conviction dismissed.

(2)Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 

(3)The sentence imposed in the District Court on 27 July 2012 on Count 4 on the indictment is quashed.

(4)In lieu thereof, a sentence of imprisonment of 14 years and 6 months is imposed, commencing on 11 March 2011 and expiring on 10 September 2025, comprising a non-parole period of 9 years and 6 months and an additional term of 5 years.

(5)The appellant will become eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 10 September 2020.

2423638,GJ v R [2014] NSWCCA 292,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: I agree with Price J.

2PRICE J: GJ, the appellant, seeks leave to appeal out of time pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the sentence imposed upon him by Sweeney DCJ on 15 March 2012. 

3The appellant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the following offences:

(i) Sequence 1: 

An offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), which occurred between 16 September 2000 and 16 September 2002, with a victim who was under the age of sixteen years, namely aged seven or eight years. This offence carried a maximum penalty at the time of the commission of the offence of 20 years imprisonment. 

(ii) Sequence 9:

An offence of aggravated indecent assault, contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, being an offence that occurred between 16 September 2005 and 16 September 2006, when the victim was under sixteen years, namely aged twelve years. The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to 
s 61M(1) is 7 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years.

(iii) Sequence 16:

An offence of aggravated indecent assault, contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, being an offence that occurred between 16 September 2006 and 16 September 2007 when the victim was under sixteen years, namely aged thirteen years. 

(iv) Sequence 7: 

An offence of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, being an offence that occurred between 16 September 2007 and 16 September 2008, when the victim was under sixteen years, namely aged fourteen years. 

(v) Sequence 11: 

An offence of using a child under fourteen years of age for pornographic purposes, contrary to s 91G(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, during the period 16 September 2005 and 16 September 2007, when the victim was twelve and thirteen years of age. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment. 



(vi) Sequence 8:

An offence of using a child above fourteen years of age for pornographic purposes, contrary to s 91G(2)(a) of the Crimes Act, during the period between 16 September 2007 and 16 September 2008, when the victim was fourteen years of age. The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment. 

4All of the above offences were committed by the appellant on his youngest daughter. 

5When adhering to his pleas of guilty in the District Court, the appellant asked her Honour to take into account on sentence four offences contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act that had been placed on a Form 1. 

6The appellant was sentenced as follows (ROS 10):

(i) Sequence 9; a non-parole period of 1 year's imprisonment, commencing on 20 January 2012, with an additional term of 1 year's imprisonment. 

(ii) Sequence 16; a non-parole period of 1 year's imprisonment, commencing on 20 January 2012, with an additional term of 1 year's imprisonment. 

(iii) Sequence 11; a non-parole period of 2 year's imprisonment, commencing on 20 January 2012, with an additional term of 1 year's imprisonment.

(iv) Sequence 8; a non-parole period of 1 year's imprisonment, commencing on 20 January 2012, with an additional term of 1 year's imprisonment. 

(v) Sequence 7; a non-parole period of 3 year's imprisonment, commencing on 20 January 2013, with an additional term of eighteen months imprisonment. 

(vi) Sequence 1 (taking into account the four offences on the Form 1); a non-parole period of 4 years imprisonment, commencing on 20 January 2014, with an additional term of 3 years imprisonment. 

7The total effective sentence imposed by the Judge was 9 years imprisonment commencing on 20 January 2012 and expiring on 19 January 2021, with a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 20 January 2012 and expiring on 19 January 2018. The earliest date the appellant is eligible to be released on parole is 19 January 2018. 

8The Judge had reduced the sentence by 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. 


FACTS 

9An agreed statement of facts was tendered which the Judge summarised in her sentencing remarks. The appellant was born in 1960 and married his wife in 1988, having three children. The youngest child was the victim of the appellant's offending. The offences took place between 2000, when she was 7 or 8 years old and the middle of 2008, when she was 14 years old. 

10Shortly stated the facts are: 

Sequence 1: This offence occurred when the victim was 7 or 8 years old. The appellant went into her bedroom (which she shared with her older sister). The victim was asleep but awoke when he pulled her legs to the side of the bed. He pulled down her underpants, knelt on the floor and held her legs in the air. He licked her vagina for about two minutes. 

Sequence 11: On three separate occasions in March, May and July 2006 when the victim was 12 years old, the appellant photographed her naked body and vagina with his mobile telephone. He told her how to position her body before he took the photographs. On two other occasions, in October 2006 and June 2007, when she was 13, he engaged in the same conduct. All of this conduct was dealt with as one charge. 

Sequence 9: On one of the occasions in sequence 11 in 2006, the appellant took the victim's hand and moved it along the shaft of his penis.

Sequence 16: On one of the occasions in sequence 11, in 2006 or 2007, when she was 13, the appellant touched her vagina with one of his hands.

Sequence 8: On two occasions in January 2008 and August 2008, when the victim was 14, he used his mobile phone camera to photograph her body and vagina. This conduct was dealt with as one count. 

Sequence 7: When the victim was 14 and having a shower, the appellant got into the shower with her, kissed her on the lips and put his tongue in her mouth (Form 1 offence - sequence 4). He told her to put her hand on his penis and guided her hand along the shaft for about 10 minutes (Form 1 offence sequence 5). He then positioned her against the wall and stood behind her, rubbing his penis against her vagina and bottom, moving backwards and forwards for three to four minutes (sequence 7). 

The other Form 1 offences involved the appellant rubbing his penis against the victim's vagina (sequence 14) and moving her hand along the shaft (sequence 17). 







The appellant's subjective circumstances

11At the time he committed the offences, the appellant was aged 40 - 48 years. He was 52 years old when sentenced. 

12The appellant had worked all of his adult life as a coach driver and had no prior convictions. 

13In a report dated 21 November 2011, Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist, observed that the appellant did not have a psychiatric disorder, nor did he have any substance abuse issues. The Judge noted that Dr Nielssen reported that the appellant acknowledged his offences and expressed remorse for his behaviour. Her Honour stated (ROS 7):

""Although [the appellant] did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings, I accept Dr Nielssen's professional opinion and accept [the appellant] is remorseful, as also indicated by his early pleas of guilty.""

14The Judge related Dr Nielssen's dismissal of paedophilia and characterisation of the appellant's offences as ""intra-familial, opportunistic offences that do not appear to be the result of a primary disorder of deviant sexual interest"". Her Honour noted Dr Nielssen's opinion: ""that this category of offence is typically associated with a lower risk of re-offending"" (ROS 9). Her Honour observed (ROS 9): 

""Dr Nielssen's opinion bodes well for [the appellant's] prospects of rehabilitation.""

The adjournment application 

15The application for leave to appeal was filed on 11 September 2014 some 2 years 6 months after the appellant was sentenced. An affidavit of Malcolm Douglas Carr, the appellant's solicitor, was filed in Court, which sought to explain the delay in instituting the appeal. As Mr Carr was not instructed prior to 4 December 2013, there was no material before the Court as to what may have occurred prior to that date after the appellant was sentenced. Mr R Sweet, the appellant's counsel recognised the difficulties that created for the appellant and sought an adjournment of the hearing of the appeal. 

16The application for the adjournment was refused, as the Court considered that the proposed appeal had no merit and there were no prospects of success, even if the appellant was able to provide in the future a satisfactory explanation for the substantial delay in commencing the appeal. The Court was of the opinion that the rejection of the appellant's application did not cause any injustice to him.

Grounds of Appeal 

17The Notice of Appeal identifies two grounds, namely: 

1. Sweeney DCJ erred in law, causing her sentencing discretion to miscarry, in that she failed to apply the totality principles, having added up the sentences for each of the offences. 

2. Sweeney DCJ erred in law, causing her sentencing discretion to miscarry, in that she failed to give any or any adequate reasons as to why she had ordered some of the sentences to be served cumulatively upon other sentences imposed.

18The two grounds of appeal may be conveniently dealt with together. 

19The appellant submitted that, having reached the conclusion after sentencing the offender on six separate offences, that the total effective sentence was 9 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 6 years, her Honour erred ""in that she failed to record that she had considered and/or clearly failed to comply [with] the totality principle"" (AWS 2.1.1). The appellant referred to the totality principle having two limbs, the first being that the total effective sentence must ""bear a proper relationship"" to the ""overall criminality"" involved in all the offences and the second limb being that the ""total effective sentence imposed on an offender"" should not constitute a ""crushing sentence"" (AWS 2.1.3).

20A further contention was that, having reached the conclusion that it was appropriate for there to be ""partial accumulation"" of the sentences, her Honour fell into error in giving absolutely no reasons at all as to why it was that she imposed sentences that were ""partly concurrent and partly accumulated"", other than stating she had done so to ""achieve an appropriate total sentence"" (AWS 3.1.1).

21The Crown referred to the Judge's findings in her remarks on sentence and submitted that it was obvious that she had considered the principle of totality. The Crown pointed out that an accumulation simpliciter of the individual non-parole periods would have resulted in an effective non-parole period of 12 years. The Crown contended that the Judge clearly took into account totality in reaching an effective non-parole period of half that length, and only two-thirds of the effective head sentence, having appropriately found special circumstances in order to adjust the ratio of individual non-parole periods to head sentences (CWS 35).

Consideration 

22As the appellant was being sentenced for more than one offence, the Judge was obliged to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well as questions of totality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57. The total sentence imposed must properly reflect the totality of the criminality: R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219. Subject to the application of established principle, questions of accumulation or concurrence are discretionary: Cahyadi v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 41; [2007] NSWCCA1; R v XX (2009) 195 A Crim R 38; [2009] NSWCCA 115. 

23It is evident from her Honour's sentencing remarks that she carefully considered each of the offences and separately assessed their objective seriousness. After recounting the appellant's subjective case and determining that the sentences would be reduced by 25 per cent for the pleas of guilty, her Honour said (ROS 10): 

""To achieve an appropriate total sentence, the sentences will be partly concurrent and partially accumulated. I found special circumstances in the partial accumulation of the sentences to vary some of the non-parole periods"" (italics added) 


24In the exercise of her discretion, the Judge commenced the sentences for offence sequences 8, 9, 11 and 16 on 20 January 2012. The sentence for offence sequence 7, was partially accumulated on the non-parole period of offence sequence 11, as the sentence commenced on 20 January 2013. The sentence for offence sequence 1 (including Form 1 offences) was partially accumulated on the non-parole period of offence sequence 7 as the sentence commenced on 20 January 2014. 

25It is plain that the Judge undertook the task of separately determining the starting points and lengths of each of the sentences in order to give effect to the principle of totality. Her Honour was not obliged to otherwise explain the structure of the sentence. In my opinion, the total effective sentence was appropriate for all of the appellant's offending and was not a crushing sentence. Accordingly, I propose that leave to appeal out of time be refused. 

26McCALLUM J: I agree with Price J.

2423788,Ilievski v R [2014] NSWCCA 321,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with McCallum J.
2McCALLUM J:  Billy Ilievski seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Finnane DCJ in the District Court on 12 April 2012.  The judge imposed an aggregate sentence in respect of a total of 20 offences in a series of breaking, entering and stealing from commercial premises.  The applicant was arraigned on an indictment containing 12 counts, to which he pleaded not guilty.  The judge directed verdicts of not guilty on 2 counts and the applicant was found not guilty by the jury on a further count.  He was found guilty of the remaining 9 counts.  He then pleaded guilty to each of the 5 counts on a second indictment and asked the judge to take into account a further 6 counts on a form 1.  
3The convictions related to a course of offending undertaken with three co-offenders commencing in July 2009 and continuing until March 2010, when the applicant was arrested.  The particular offences for which the applicant was sentenced were as follows:
(a) on the indictment on which the applicant stood trial, four offences of breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence (stealing) contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.  That offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and has a standard non-parole period of 5 years.  There was also an offence of attempted aggravated breaking, entering and stealing, which carries the same maximum penalty (20 years) but no standard non-parole period.  There were three offences of aggravated breaking and entering with intent to steal, contrary to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act.  That offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years.  Finally, there was an offence of knowingly disposing of stolen property contrary to s 188(1) of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years;
(b) the offences on the second indictment (to which the applicant pleaded guilty) were five further offences of aggravated breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence (stealing) contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act;
(c) the six further offences on the form 1, to be taken into account on count 4 on the second indictment, were four further offences of aggravated breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence (stealing) contrary to s 112(2); an attempt to commit that offence and an offence of aggravated breaking and entering with intent contrary to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act.
4The judge imposed an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 16 years with a non-parole period of 10 years.  His Honour indicated the sentences he would have imposed had an aggregate sentence not been imposed, as required under s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  The indicative sentences were as follows:
(a) for each of the s 112(2) offences at trial, a sentence of imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months;
(b) for the s 112(2) offences on the second indictment (to which the applicant pleaded guilty), allowing a discount of 10 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea, a sentence of imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months;
(c) for count 4 on the second indictment (on which the judge took into account the matters on the form 1), a sentence of 5 years imprisonment and a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months;
(d) for the offence against s 188, a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years;
(e) for the offences under s 113(2), a fixed term of 4 years imprisonment.
5It is not necessary to recite the detail of the circumstances of the offences.  In summary the applicant, together with various combinations of his co-offenders, broke into a number of commercial premises.  Entry was effected in each instance by cutting chain wire fences or other surrounding fences, boring a hole in the door of the premises using a round or square drill bit, opening the door and entering the premises and stealing.  Each of the offences was committed at night when the premises were closed.  At no point was any member of the public confronted or harmed.  The items stolen ranged from cigarettes, electrical goods including Ipads and Iphones and in one instance golf clubs.  The offenders wore disguises and covered their hands so as to leave no DNA or fingerprints.  The judge found that the offences were carried out in an efficient and clearly organised fashion.
6Two of the applicant's co-offenders were Velco Kostovski and Blagoya Nikolovski.  They were arrested while committing an offence which did not involve the applicant.  They agreed to give evidence against him and at least Kostovski did so at the trial.  Their assistance to law enforcement authorities in that and other respects, together with their pleas entered at the earliest opportunity, resulted in their being allowed a combined discount of 50 per cent to their sentences. 
7Kostovksi and Nikolovski were sentenced by Berman DCJ before the applicant's trial.  His Honour undertook a careful analysis of the seriousness of their offending, noting that, within the range of offences liable to be charged under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act (breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence), the offence of stealing is one of the less serious forms of ""serious indictable offence"" which could constitute that element of the offence.  His Honour noted that the section could also apply to a person who committed an offence of breaking and entering a house and committing aggravated sexual assault.  His Honour also noted that, whereas the circumstance of aggravation in the present case was the fact that the offenders were in company, there are other more serious forms of aggravation (such as the infliction of actual bodily harm).
8In sentencing the applicant, Finnane DCJ adopted that analysis.  His Honour regarded the offences as being serious but said that none of them could be regarded as a mid-range offence.  He noted that all of the offences occurred at night time after the premises were shut and that no person was present to be threatened.  They were commercial premises, not the home of any person and the purpose of the invasion of the property in each case was the stealing of goods ""and nothing else"".  His Honour noted that the offences did not involve any wanton destruction of property, as sometimes occurs in offences of this nature.  The only harm done to the premises was that necessary to effect entry.
9The applicant relies on the following four grounds of appeal:
(1)The sentence imposed was too severe.
(2)In sentencing the applicant, his Honour erred in failing to take into proper consideration the applicant's intellectual disability.
(3)His Honour erred in finding that the applicant was the mastermind behind the offences and sentencing him as the principal offender.
(4)His Honour erred in not properly applying the principles of parity in sentencing.
10Dealing first with ground 2, there were two expert reports before the sentencing judge dealing with the issue of the applicant's intellectual disability.  The applicant was first assessed by a neuropsychologist, Dr Susan Pullman.  In a report dated 8 March 2011 (exhibit 1 in the proceedings on sentence), she recorded the applicant's presentation as an anxious and softly spoken gentleman.  She said that although he was polite, he became easily fatigued during the assessment.  Aspects of his behaviour were unusual, prompting her to suggest review by a forensic psychiatrist.
11Dr Pullman recorded the applicant's history of an unhappy childhood.  His parents separated when he was three or four.  Initially, his father had custody of him and his brother.  His father drank heavily and was very violent towards the children, prompting the older brother to run away from home, leaving the applicant alone with the abusive father.  Ultimately the applicant also returned to his mother's custody.
12Dr Pullman conducted a number of intelligence tests.  The tests showed that the applicant has significantly impaired language skills.  She stated that his ability to read is ""very poor"".  There was a marked difference between his verbal comprehension skills and his ""perceptual (non-verbal) reasoning skills"" which she described as clinically abnormal.   Dr Pullman expressed the opinion that this would have contributed to marked learning difficulties at school, reduced the applicant's ability to socialise and prevented him from securing vocational opportunities.  She said ""individuals with such limited verbal skills can be vulnerable and easily influenced by others"".  
13In accordance with Dr Pullman's recommendation, the applicant was then assessed by a psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen.  In his report dated 23 March 2012 (exhibit 3), Dr Nielssen recorded the applicant's account of his involvement in the offences.  The applicant told Dr Nielssen that Mr Kostovski had told the police that the applicant was the organiser of the offences. Dr Nielssen recorded:
""However he said that Mr Kostovski was the person who knew what to do and planned all of the offences. He said that he had been taken along to help and that Mr Kostovski's uncle, Bobby Nikolovski was ""always there"".  He said that the other person named in the indictment, Matthew Brady, was his former next door neighbour who he had introduced to Mr Kostovski.""
14Dr Nielssen stated his diagnoses of the applicant as follows:  alcohol abuse disorder; dysthymic disorder (chronic low-grade depression); possible underlying psychotic illness and low normal or sub-normal intelligence (based on Dr Pullman's tests as confirmed by his own assessment).  
15In respect of the applicant's intellectual disability, Dr Nielssen said that there was no issue as to the applicant's fitness to enter a plea and that he was not found to have a mental illness or condition that prevented him from recognising that what he was doing was wrong.  Dr Nielssen noted, however, that the history obtained, the applicant's presentation during the assessment and the result of Dr Pullman's testing, corroborated by information obtained from the applicant's brother, suggested that the applicant ""would not have been able to commit these offences on his own"".  Dr Nielssen thought those factors supported the applicant's account of being drawn into assisting in committing the offences through his association with Mr Kostovski.
16The applicant complains in ground 2 that the sentencing judge failed to take into proper consideration the applicant's intellectual disability.  It is trite to observe that the ""proper"" consideration to be given to any factor in sentencing an offender is not to be determined by reference to the weight the appellate court would itself have given to that factor.  A ground of appeal that adopts terms of indeterminate reference such as ""proper"" consideration or ""due"" weight must not obscure the need to establish error in the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion.  
17The judge referred to Dr Nielssen's findings, including the fact that the finding as to the applicant's low normal or sub-normal intelligence was based on the findings of Dr Pullman.  The applicant complained that the judge was dismissive of Dr Pullman's findings in his mere reference to her as a ""psychologist"". I do not think the words chosen by the judge reveal a dismissive approach.  
18After considering Dr Pullman's findings, the judge said:
""I find it difficult to be certain about that matter at all, since it is clear he is capable of planning and executing, with some degree of precision, burglaries of commercial premises. It would seem improbable to me that somebody of low intelligence would be able to do that.""
19The degree of scepticism with which medical opinions of the kind carefully articulated by Dr Pullman and Dr Nielssen will be assessed will undoubtedly vary from judge to judge.  The conclusion expressed by his Honour is not the one I would have reached, but it cannot be said that it was not open to his Honour.  His Honour heard all of the evidence at the trial, which is not before this Court.  Accordingly, I am of the view that ground 2 must be rejected.
20Ground 3 alleges that the sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant was the mastermind behind the offences and in sentencing him as the principal offender.  
21That is a paraphrase of what his Honour said.  As already noted, Mr Kostovski gave evidence at the applicant's trial but there is nothing in the remarks on sentence to suggest that his Honour relied on that evidence in his assessment of their respective culpability for the offences. Rather, his Honour appears to have relied in this context on the remarks of Berman DCJ in sentencing the co-offenders.  His Honour said:
""The co-offenders, as I have said, were dealt with by Judge Berman.  It is perfectly plain to me, from reading the sentences of Judge Berman, that the evidence put before him was to the effect that this man was the man who planned and executed these burglaries and recruited the others to be with him.""
22Having read the remarks of Berman DCJ in respect of each of the co-offenders, I am unable to see how Finnane DCJ reached that conclusion.  Certainly, the remarks relating to the co-offender Brady record the fact that it was the applicant who recruited him.  However, there is nothing in the remarks of Berman DCJ to suggest that it was the applicant who recruited Kostovski and Nikolovski, or that he was the one who planned and executed the burglaries.
23On the contrary, the remarks of Berman DCJ in sentencing Kostovski and Nikolovski appear to characterise Kostovski as the person who played the most serious role in the offending, with barely a mention of Ilievski.  Kostovski is Nikolovski's nephew.  Each agreed to give evidence against Ilievski.  They were sentenced at the same time, in December 2010.  Each received a combined discount of 50 per cent for assistance to law enforcement authorities and their early pleas of guilty.  Berman DCJ's judgment is appropriately cryptic as to the assistance given but it appears to have extended well beyond the agreement to give evidence against Ilievski.
24Berman DCJ expressly noted that, although Nikolovski was older, Kostovski was ""much more heavily involved than his uncle"".  A policeman gave evidence (presumably at the proceedings on sentence) that Nikolovski was a minor player who only became involved in the offending at the request of his nephew.  His Honour noted that Kostovski had ""problems with drugs and gambling, both activities which require significant sums of money."" Kostovski had also become ""responsible"" for a debt owed by one of his friends.  He told Probation and Parole and a psychiatrist that ""it was this debt combined with his drug use and gambling problems which played a significant part in the commission of these offences.""  He does not appear to have complained to either that he became involved at the behest of Ilievski, nor credited him with being the mastermind.  There is no reference in the remarks to any evidence put before Berman DCJ to the effect that Ilievski ""was the man who planned and executed these burglaries"".  There is no reference to his having recruited Kostovski or taken any greater role than Kostovski.
25Brady was sentenced by Berman DCJ almost a year later, in November 2011.  His Honour was evidently very moved by Brady's personal circumstances: his childhood was simply tragic.  He had no prior convictions and had been led into trouble by Ilievski at a time of extreme vulnerability.  Those are the only remarks of Berman DCJ to suggest that Ilievski was a principal in the enterprise.
26Brady did not provide assistance to authorities.  He pleaded guilty late and received a discount of 10 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea.  He was sentenced for 5 offences  of aggravated breaking, entering and stealing contrary to s 112(2) and had a further 5 ""broadly similar offences"" taken into account on a form 1.  Berman DCJ was reluctant to sentence him to a term of imprisonment having regard to his extremely sad childhood and his history of good employment but considered that was what the offending required.  His overall sentence was imprisonment for 3 years, suggesting a starting point of about 3 years and 4 months.  With the benefit of a finding of special circumstances, he was given a non-parole period of 2 years.
27In my view, all that can be gleaned from the remarks of Berman DCJ as to the relative offending of Ilievski and Kostovski is that each was heavily involved in ongoing, serious offending.  Ilievski recruited Brady; Kostovski recruited Nikolovski.  There is nothing in his Honour's remarks to warrant the conclusion that Ilievski was the ringleader or the organiser so far as Kostovski was concerned. 28Nikolovski received an overall sentence of imprisonment for 5 years, suggesting a starting point of 10 years.  With the benefit of a finding of special circumstances, he was given a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months (a ratio of 50 per cent).
29Kostovski apparently committed a total of 25 offences of aggravated breaking, entering and stealing contrary to s 112(2).  There were 6 offences under that section on the indictment and a further 19 ""similar matters"" on a form 1.  The total retail value of the items he stole was over $600,000.  His overall sentence was imprisonment for 6 years and 6 months, suggesting a starting point of 13 years.  With the benefit of a finding of special circumstances, he was given a non-parole period of 4 years (a ratio of just over 60 per cent).
30Ilievski was sentenced for 19 offences, 13 on indictment (11 of which were committed with Kostovski) and 6 on a form 1.  Fifteen were charges under s 112(2).  The remaining four were offences of aggravated breaking and entering with intent to steal contrary to s 113(2), which is a lesser offence, carrying a maximum of 14 years.  Although it is not recorded in the remarks of Finnane DCJ, it was stated in the proceedings on sentence that the value of the property taken in Ilievski's offending was just under $400,000. The earliest offence in the case of both Kostovski and Ilievski was 7 July 2009, suggesting that they each committed their first offence together.  Each had a number of serious prior convictions.
31In sentencing Ilievski, Finnane DCJ said ""the overall criminality is very similar for all of them, except that, in my opinion, the evidence shows that the offender was the one who was the organiser.""  The only reference to evidence elsewhere in his Honour's remarks is to the evidence he thought was put before Berman DCJ.  His Honour makes no reference to evidence given by Kostovski at the trial.  Yet Ilievski received a sentence 3 years higher than the starting point for Kostovski, who committed more offences and whose offending involved $200,000 more in the value of the property stolen.
32If the only basis for the finding that Ilievski was the ringleader was what Finnane DCJ derived from the remarks of Berman DCJ, in my view the finding was plainly not open.  As already noted, his Honour did not suggest that the finding was based on any evidence given in the trial of Ilievski.  However, I am mindful of the fact that his Honour's remarks were given ex tempore.  In case I have misunderstood the basis of the finding, I would indicate that, in any event, I consider the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances.  
33I am further of the view that the applicant is entitled to feel a legitimate sense of grievance when the sentence imposed on him is compared with that imposed on Kostovski.  Even if Ilievski was in some respect an organiser of the group, Kostovski committed more offences (obviously without Ilievski) and stole items of considerably greater value ($200,000 more).  There does not appear to be any basis for passing an even sterner sentence on Ilievski than was reflected in the stern starting point identified by Berman DCJ before his Honour allowed Kostovski a combined discount of 50 per cent.  In my view, the totality of Ilievski's offending was plainly less serious than that of Kostovski.
34For all of those reasons, I am of the view that the appeal should be allowed and a lesser sentence passed.
35A further report of Dr Olav Neilssen was obtained to be relied upon in the event of re-sentence.  The report shows that the applicant is suffering considerably in gaol, for two well-documented medical reasons.  One is that he suffers from diabetes, which is difficult to manage in custody.  That has resulted in his physical health deteriorating quite dramatically.  The progression of the disease and the difficulty of managing it have in turn exacerbated the applicant's depression, despite anti-depressant medication.
36I would accept the indicative sentences stated by Finnane DCJ as being appropriate.  Taking into account all of the factors to which I have referred throughout this judgment, I consider that the applicant should be re-sentenced to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 10 years.  His plain need for supervision combined with his poor state of physical and mental health in my view warrant a substantial departure from the statutory ratio of the non-parole period to the balance of term.  I would fix a non-parole period of 6 years.
37The orders I propose are:
(1)that leave to appeal be granted;(2)that the appeal be allowed;
(3)that the sentence passed at first instance be quashed and in substitution therefor that the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 12 April 2012 and expiring on 11 April 2018 and a balance of term of 4 years expiring on 11 April 2022.
38On that basis, the applicant would be eligible for parole upon the expiration of his non-parole period on 11 April 2018.
39GARLING J: I agree with McCallum J.

2423841,Hutchinson v R [2014] NSWCCA 317,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with Fullerton J.
2FULLERTON J:  On 7 August 2013, the applicant was sentenced in the District Court after pleading guilty to one count of supply of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (""MDMA"") contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) in an amount not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that drug, and one count of possessing the proceeds of crime, knowing that the money was the proceeds of crime, contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). 
3Schedule 1 to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act specifies a commercial quantity of MDMA as 0.125 kilograms and a large commercial quantity as 0.5 kilograms.  The applicant had in his possession (for supply) 497.4 grams of MDMA, that is, 2.6 grams less than the large commercial quantity.  The supply of a commercial quantity of MDMA attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, to which a standard non-parole period of 10 years applies.
4Knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a period of 15 years.  
5After allowing for a discount of 25 per cent for the plea of guilty and a discount of 25 per cent for assistance, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years on the supply count with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, and a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months on the proceeds count to be served concurrently with the sentence on the supply count.  
6After a finding of special circumstances, the total effective sentence was imprisonment for a term of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months.
7The applicant was committed for sentence on 11 April 2012.  He pleaded guilty on arraignment in the District Court on 17 June 2013 but was not sentenced at that time.  The proceedings were adjourned to allow investigating police to speak to the applicant in the expectation that he could provide assistance.  He was sentenced on 7 August 2013. 
8The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed against him on three grounds:
Ground 1: A starting point sentence of 10 years imprisonment before application of discounts for an early plea and assistance to law enforcement authorities was manifestly excessive.
Ground 2: The discount of 25 per cent for assistance to law enforcement authorities was, in the circumstances, inadequate and failed to quantify future assistance to law enforcement authorities. 
Ground 3:  The applicant seeks leave to introduce fresh evidence concerning the significance, nature, usefulness and extent of the applicant's further and ongoing assistance to law enforcement authorities. On the assumption this fresh evidence is admitted on appeal, the applicant's sentence is manifestly excessive and a sentence less severe should be imposed. 
The facts 
9The Crown tendered a set of agreed facts, the applicant's criminal history and a sealed envelope containing an affidavit of a Superintendent of Police in charge of the State Intelligence Group of the Queensland Police Service attesting to the nature and extent of the applicant's assistance to law enforcement authorities into identifiable criminal activity which her Honour found to be ongoing. 
10The applicant did not give evidence and called no evidence on his own behalf. 
11The following facts are derived from the agreed facts.
12At about 5.10pm on 17 October 2011, a police broadcast alerted police to a black BMW sedan as it travelled towards Dubbo.  The occupants of the vehicle were believed to be in possession of prohibited drugs.
13The vehicle was stopped by police.  The applicant was in the front passenger seat.  On the back seat, police located three boxes containing plastic resealable bags.  Two of the boxes appeared unopened and one box opened.
14The police searched the applicant and removed, from the front of his pants, a resealable plastic bag containing a number of blue pills.  The applicant also produced a small plastic container which contained white pills and $4200, in cash, in various denominations.
15The applicant was arrested and cautioned.  When he was searched police located four mobile phones.
16The applicant and the driver were conveyed to Dubbo Police Station and entered into custody.
17The vehicle was towed to the police holding yard. 
18The driver (who was the owner of the vehicle) was interviewed.  He denied any knowledge of the drugs or cash in the applicant's possession.  He was released from custody without charge. 
19The applicant was interviewed.  When asked whether there were any other drugs in the vehicle, the applicant told police that there was MDMA secreted in the roof cavity.  He told police he brought the drugs with him from Queensland hoping to sell them in Griffith over the forthcoming weekend.  Although he admitted to using MDMA, he said his motive as a supplier was the expectation of earning about $5000.  The applicant admitted that the $4200 seized by police was from the proceeds of selling other quantities of MDMA.
20The applicant remained in custody until 1 November 2011 when he was granted conditional bail.  He remained on bail until he was sentenced on 7 August 2013. 
The sentencing judge's decision
21In determining the combined discount for the applicant's early plea and assistance to the authorities, the sentencing judge said:
""In his favour he has no prior drug offences and he has provided considerable assistance to the authorities in the long period since his arrest.  He has entered a plea at the earliest opportunity and was in fact committed for sentence on 11 April 2012 from Dubbo Court.  This delay in sentencing him has been brought about by the ongoing assistance he has provided.  In terms of his early plea of guilty he will be given a 25 per cent discount from the sentence that might otherwise have been imposed.  In addition in regards to the assistance provided which is of quite an extensive and wide ranging and ongoing nature, he will receive a further discount of 25  per cent on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed.  In those circumstances there is a distinct likelihood that whilst in custody there will be considerable hardship on his part and there may be a requirement for protection.  I take that matter into account in passing sentence as well.""[Emphasis added]
22In assessing the objective seriousness of the supply offence, her Honour held:
""For an offence of this kind [the supply count] it is objectively serious.  There was a large quantity of drugs involved for an offence of this kind being at the upper end of the range being only 4 grams below the large commercial quantity.  He was probably down the chain of supply somewhat because he was actually going to try to sell these drugs himself in Griffith and was probably acting for someone else in having this large quantity in his possession.  However there is clearly premeditation on his part which can be readily concluded from the circumstances and the fact that he had four mobile phones in his possession.  There is a clear element of sophistication in the offence.  Although it is an isolated offence, when considering the total of his subjective circumstances it is clear that he intended to sell this significant quantity and no doubt conduct a number of sales in the process.  He was also clearly motivated by profit and, as indicated, expected to receive about $5000 for his role in the offence.  Taking into account those matters he has put himself firmly into the mid-range of objective seriousness if not, a little above.""
23The sentencing judge took into account that the offences were committed whilst the applicant was the subject of two 2-year good behavior bonds imposed under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 
24The sentencing judge found the following subjective factors in the applicant's favour in mitigation of penalty:
(1)He was remorseful;
(2)He indicated a preparedness and an ability to take significant steps towards rehabilitation;
(3)His criminal record consisted primarily of driving offences and he had not previously been in custody other than the short time on remand;
(4)He comes from a good family who continue to support him;
(5)He had the benefit of a sound upbringing such that there was nothing that would readily explain his involvement in the supply of illegal drugs, save for the fact that he may have ""fallen in with a bad crowd"" when he was on the Gold Coast and was hoping to recover money owed to him by himself selling drugs;
(6)Although he took five MDMA tablets a day prior to the date of arrest, since his arrest he has ceased using illegal drugs; and
(7)Special circumstances were found based partly on his youth (being aged 23 at the time of offence) and his excellent prospects of rehabilitation.
The appeal
The first ground
25On the hearing of the appeal, the applicant's counsel accepted that to submit that ""a sentence"" is manifestly excessive referable to the undiscounted sentence was contrary to settled principle (see most recently Piscitelli v R [2013] NSWCCA 8 at [91] per Button J).  Accordingly, the first ground of appeal was not pressed.  No other submission was advanced, either in writing or orally, to support the proposition that her Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending in the mid range, ""if not a little higher"", or that any other error infected the exercise of the sentencing discretion so as to result in a sentence that was unreasonable or plainly unjust.  
26I would dismiss the first ground of appeal.
The second ground
27The second ground of appeal concerns what was said to be error in her Honour's appointment of a 25 per cent discount for the applicant's assistance to law enforcement authorities, in particular, her failure to give adequate consideration to the fact that at time of sentence his assistance was ongoing.  
28The submissions filed in support of this ground of appeal, complain that her Honour omitted to refer to s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and did not quantify the discount for future assistance as required by s 23(4).  That submission was not developed orally.  No submissions were directed to identifying error in the failure to specify any of the matters the Court is obliged to consider under s 23(3) when deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty on account of assistance to authorities and the nature and extent of the resulting sentence. 
29The ultimate position put in submissions on the applicant's behalf was that the discretionary assessment of the value of the applicant's assistance to the authorities has miscarried, not limited to her Honour's failure to assess the value of his ongoing assistance but also including her failure to appreciate that the assistance was, as his counsel described it, ""extensive and multifunctional, cogent and efficacious"".  Counsel submitted that, in addition to the 25 per cent allowed for the early plea, a discrete discount in the order of 35 to 40 per cent should have been allowed for past and future assistance so that a combined discount of between 60 and 65 per cent should have been applied and not the 50 per cent applied by the sentencing judge. 
30In the Crown's submission, although it is preferable for a sentencing judge to specify the discount allowed for future assistance, if no other reason than to facilitate the bringing of a Crown appeal under s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) where a person has had their sentence reduced on the basis of an undertaking to assist law enforcement authorities and where that person fails wholly or partly to fulfil that undertaking, s 23(6) makes it clear that the failure to do so will not invalidate the sentence. In this case, there was no undertaking of the kind contemplated by s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act although it was clear at the time of sentence her Honour appreciated that the applicant was continuing to provide assistance to police.  
31In LB v R [2013] NSWCCA 70 at [44], Button J (with whom Bathurst CJ and Hidden J agreed) observed that in cases where a discount is to be given for both a plea of guilty and for both past and future assistance, an apportionment of discount between all three factors should be indicated in a judge's sentencing reasons in order to comply with ss 23(3) and 23(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  This approach is consistent with the Court's earlier decision in R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38; 219 A Crim R 415.  
32In Ehrlich, Basten JA at [6], citing R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220; 53 A Crim R 248, emphasised that the appointment of a discount for assistance involves a broad discretionary exercise.  It is neither a rigid or mathematical exercise, nor an exercise where some notional ""tariff"" might be discernible from other cases.  In the judgment of Johnson J in Ehrlich at [63], his Honour also emphasised that the challenge to the discretionary judgment that is engaged when a discount for assistance is under challenge must be in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. 
33For my part, I can see no House v The King error in her Honour allowing a 25 per cent discount for the applicant's assistance which, I am satisfied, having reviewed the affidavit evidence, was both significant, useful and timely.  Her Honour also made allowance for the likelihood that the applicant would experience hardship in custody with the possibility that he would require protection despite there being no evidence to establish that fact.  Although this finding and her Honour's assessment of the utility of the assistance were not expressed to be in compliance with the mandatory considerations under s 23(2), they are in substantial compliance with the intended operation of that section (see ss 23(2)(b), (c) and (e)).  
34A final and critical consideration imposed by s 23(3) is that the application of the discount for assistance must not result in a sentence that is unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.  
35For my part, a sentence any less than what was imposed in this case would be unreasonably disproportionate to the applicants admitted and serious drug offending.  As I noted earlier, in addition to the combined discount of 50 per cent, her Honour extended leniency to the applicant by a finding of special circumstances.  The variation to the statutory ratio under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act resulted in a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months and an additional term of 2 years and 6 months. 
36I would dismiss the second ground of appeal. 
37Having reasoned to that conclusion, I consider it is unnecessary to refer to the question raised but not resolved in Ehrlich, namely whether there is, or ought to be, some restraint where a discount for assistance is under consideration, or whether the approach of in SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 (and of cases that have been applied or cited with approval since that time) to the effect that a combined discount the pleas of guilty and assistant should not normally exceed 50 per cent, remains good law.  
The third ground
38The third ground of appeal was also not ultimately pressed after the Court's attention was drawn to the decision in R v Perez-Vargas (1986) 8 NSWLR 559; 25 A Crim R 194 at 565.  That case is clear authority for the proposition that in the absence of error enlivening this Court's jurisdiction on re-sentence, the assistance an offender has provided to the authorities after sentence is a matter for the Executive and not a matter for the invocation of the principles of fresh or new evidence.
39The orders I propose are:
(1)Leave to appeal granted.(2)Appeal dismissed.
40ADAMSON J:  I agree with Fullerton J.

King Respondent.

1918: May 31; 1918: June 25.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF
QUEBEC.

Criminal Law—Abortion—Defence of innocent
conduct—Evidence of previous offences—Rebuttal — Statutory law—Jurisdiction—""Absence.""
Articles 1014, 1017, 1019 Cr. C.—Art. 3262 (a) R.S.Q.

Under article 3262 (a) R.S.Q., the
police magistrate who presided at the trial was empowered to hold the Court of
Sessions of the Peace only ""in case of the absence or inability to act
of"" the regular Judge of the Sessions of the Peace.

Held, that
""absence"" means absence from the bench or, at most, absence from the
court-room in which the trial takes place when it begins.

When a person, accused of having unlawfully
used means to procure a miscarriage, puts forward a defence of innocent and
lawful purpose, the evidence of other women that he has previously practised
abortion on them by a similar method is admissible in rebuttal.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Court of Sessions of
the Peace, at Quebec.

The accused, appellant, was found guilty of
abortion by the trial judge, but he prayed for a case to be reserved for the
Court of King's Bench.

The questions submitted in the reserved case
stated by the trial judge are as follows:—

1. That the trial and conviction are null,
because the judge who tried the case had power to act only in the absence or
incapacity of the Judge of Sessions, whereas the latter was, in fact, neither
absent nor incapacitated.

[Page 84]

2. That the trial judge erred in admitting
evidence of other criminal acts of the appellant.

3. That, in any event, there was error in
admitting such evidence of other criminal acts in rebuttal.

The circumstances of the case are fully
stated in the judgments now reported.

Ferdinand Roy K.C., Alleyn Taschereau
K.C. and Paul Drouin for the appellant.

Arthur Lachance K.C. and Arthur
Fitzpatrick for the respondent.

Davies J.—I concur in the reasons for judgment stated by my brother Anglin
and would dismiss this appeal.

Idington J.—The appellant was convicted of abortion on his trial had
therefor, pursuant to his election for a trial without a jury, and on the 15th
May, 1917, sentenced to a term in the penitentiary.

The learned trial judge on motion of counsel for
appellant decided same day or next to reserve questions of law for the Court of
Appeal.

Of these we are appealed to in regard to the
following:—

""A."" Cette cour devait-elle
admettre les témoignages de Laetitia Clouthier et de Bernadette Clouthier pour
établir que l'accusé a déjà commis le crime dont on l'accuse?

""B."" En supposant cette preuve
légale, pouvait-elle être permise pendant l'enquête de la Couronne ""in
rebuttal?""

I have as result of reference to numerous
decisions on which I rely specially upon Rex v. Bond[1], and Rex v. Crippen[2], come to the conclusion
that the answers of the majority of the Court of Appeal to these questions are
unquestionably right,

[Page 85]

In the former case the law applicable to such a
case, and the limitations thereof, is so fully and ably dealt with that I need
not repeat what therein is applicable. Whether such proof should in all cases
be tendered in support of the case for the prosecution or only be given by way
of rebuttal must depend upon the particular circumstances of each case.

If for example the appellant had refrained from
tendering his own evidence, and relied upon others to establish an alibi, such
evidence in rebuttal could not have been properly received merely in way of
rebuttal.

But by his going into the witness box, to prove
his innocence and try to shew a case wherein accident or mistake was all that
was or could be involved, he raised a question which had to be met and could be
effectually so by proving his previous criminal acts which could not rest upon
mere mistake or accident.

One of these took place in 1914 and the other a
year or two earlier—quite enough to illuminate the whole story.

As to the collateral effects on the minds of
those having to pass upon such a case, that is something counsel defending an
accused have to reckon with, and be prepared for if rendering same necessary by
pursuing a hazardous course.

Often they have to take chances and do the best
they can; but all that furnishes no reason for rejecting evidence when clearly
admissible either in opening or in rebuttal according to the circumstances of
each case.

And one guiding rule in regard thereto should
ever be section 1019  of the Criminal Code  which reads as follows:—

1019. No conviction shall be set aside nor
any new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly
admitted or rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the
trial or some misdirection given, unless, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal

[Page 86]

some substantial wrong or miscarriage was
thereby occasioned on the trial; provided that if the Court of Appeal is of
opinion that any challenge for the defence was improperly disallowed a new
trial shall be granted. (55-56 Vict., ch. 29, sec. 746.)

I think this curative section applicable here.

The appellant, after obtaining the foregoing reservation
for the Court of Appeal on the 27th of August, 1917, nearly three months and a
half later, bethought himself of something else and that was to question the
jurisdiction of the court that tried and convicted him.

He applied to the judge who had tried him, and,
I incline to think, had with his granting his former reservation become (under
the peculiar conditional jurisdiction he had for acting) functus officio, unless
in response to the possible requirements and directions of the Court of Appeal,
he had to submit questions relative to his jurisdiction.

He graciously acceded, though I most
respectfully submit he might have been well advised under all the circumstances
and the material submitted to him, to have refused to state any further
question, unless and until the Court of Appeal under its power in section 1015 
of the Criminal Code  so directed.

The result would probably have been from what
now appears that on this branch of the case there could have been no further
appeal herein.

When or how otherwise can the convicted be
limited in regard to his appellant rights?

Suppose he had a dozen objections to make and
chose to submit one at a time only and revert to the trial judge when that
decided to state the next, and try the experiment with each, as it is agreed
there is no time limit, could he go on through his list thus?

Out of respect to the Court of Appeal I will
assume in this case that they have in substance acted under sec. 1015  and of
the questions thus secondarily presented there would remain the third as
follows:—

[Page 87]

3. Aviez-vous
juridiction pour instruire et présider le procès expéditif de l'accusé dans les
circonstances ci-dessus exposées et ce procès n'est-il pas nul pour avoir été
instruit devant un juge qui n'avait pas juridiction?

It was suggested by Mr. Fitzpatrick in argument
that as the trial must be presumed to have begun with the election of the
accused and his pleading to the charge and fixing a date for the continuance of
it the learned trial judge whose jurisdiction is attacked and his jurisdiction
that far being maintained unanimously we could not entertain this part of the
appeal.

I agree there would be much force in the
argument, especially when we bear in mind the possibility of an accused so
acting being led by the appearance of things to assume that it was the judge
who interrogated him as to his wish that would be his judge, but I fear the
decision of this court in Giroux v. The King[3], puts an end to the
import formerly attached to that test of arraignment and pleading and fixing a
date for trial.

It seems the remaining question must therefore
be answered.

I admit the possible serious consequences of
such a view for unless the fact that a judge once seized of the conduct of a
case is to be allowed to continue it even if his senior, whose absence is the
basis of his jurisdiction, should return there may be confusion arise some day.

It is not this case that embarrasses me, but
what may flow from our recognition of a dissent that only cuts a proceeding in
two.

I agree with the view taken by the majority in
the Court of Appeal that the learned senior judge's actual absence from the
trial is enough to rest the jurisdiction of his substitute upon.

This statute enabling that to be done is not
like some others which expressly or impliedly intended

[Page 88]

absence to mean an absence beyond the place of
residence or jurisdiction. Upon that many decisions rest.

I may also observe that the inability of the
senior judge to undertake the duty is an alternative ground for naming a substitute.

The statement of Judge Langelier that for
personal reasons he did not wish to sit ought to be presumed as meaning for
good reasons which in law were a valid excuse and would in the alternative
suffice, although not expressed on the record.

As at present advised I should so presume, if I
thought the statement in the record could be displaced by any such proof as
offered.

I do not however think the record can be so
displaced for our purpose by such alleged proof.

I therefore think the learned trial judge must
be held to have had jurisdiction and therefore the appeal be dismissed with
costs.

Anglin J.—Convicted by the Court of Sessions of the Peace of having
unlawfully used means to procure a miscarriage upon one Alice Vachon in July,
1916, and thereupon sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five years, the
appellant applied for and obtained the reservation of several questions of law
under section 1014  of the Criminal Code . The questions so reserved were
determined adversely to him by the Court of King's Bench—unanimously, with the
exception of three, in respect of which Mr. Justice Lavergne dissented. The
defendant now appeals to this court. I find his three grounds of appeal
succinctly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Cross in these terms:—

(1) That the trial and conviction are null,
because the judge who tried the case had power to act only in the absence or
incapacity of the Judge of Sessions, whereas the latter was, in fact, neither
absent nor incapacitated.

(2) That the learned trial judge erred in
admitting evidence of other criminal acts of the appellant.

[Page 89]

(3) That, in any event, there was error in
admitting such evidence of other criminal acts in rebuttal.

(1) The appellant urges that it appears by an
affidavit intituled and filed in the Court of Sessions of the Peace, apparently
made gratuitously by one Chouinard, the clerk of the court, that, although
there are formal entries in the record of the trial that Judge Choquette
presided in the absence of Judge Langelier, made by the direction of the
former, the latter was in fact in his chambers in the court house at the time
of the commencement of the trial. Affidavits filed on behalf of the Crown in
the Court of King's Bench not only do not contradict the fact so deposed to,
but rather support the inference that it is true. In stating the reserved case
Judge Choquette has informed the court that although Judge Langelier had
certainly been absent from the city of Quebec when the preliminary inquiry was held, neither he nor Judge Langelier
can state whether the latter was or was not in his chambers, as alleged in the
affidavits, when the trial of the accused began. He
adds:—

L'eut-il été, vu sa déclaration qu'il ne
pouvait siéger, j'avais d'apres ma commission júridiction pour entendre la
cause.

The reserved case contains no further statement
as to the presence or absence of Judge Langelier.

I am unable to accede to the contention of
counsel for the Crown that the admitted absence of Judge Langelier at the time
of the preliminary investigation would give Judge Choquette jurisdiction to sit
upon the trial of the defendant. His trial was a new proceeding which began
only after arraignment and plea at a later date then fixed for the hearing. Giroux
v. The King[4];
Re Walsh[5],
at p. 17. The absence of Judge Langelier having been recorded as the ground

[Page 90]

upon which Judge Choquette acted in his stead,
the right of the Crown to invoke Judge Langelier's inability to act, if that be
the import of Judge Choquette's reference to ""sa déclaration qu'll ne
pouvait siéger,"" would seem at least questionable. I think the case
must be dealt with on the footing that Judge Choquette's jurisdiction was
dependent upon the ""absence"" of Judge Langelier.

Counsel for the Crown maintained that entries in
the trial book conclusively established his absence and strenuously resisted
their being controverted upon extraneous evidence. I question whether upon a
proceeding such as this—a recourse afforded by the statute for the very purpose
of determining whether the trial is open to exception upon any substantial
ground that can properly be stated as a question of law—the verity of a
statement in the record in regard to a mixed matter of law and fact essential
to his jurisdiction made by or under the direction of a judge of a court of
inferior jurisdiction, although it be a court of record, should be conclusively
presumed (Mayor of London v. Cox[6];
Falkingham v. Victorian Railways Commissioner[7], at pages 463-4).

But we are dealing with a stated case (sub.-sec.
6 of sec. 1014 ) and, except as provided for by sub.-sec. 2 of sec. 1017 and
subject to the power conferred by sub-sec. 3 of the same section, I incline
strongly to the view that in disposing of the questions reserved the appellate
court is confined to the facts set forth in the stated case. Unless the
affidavit of Chouinard, intituled and filed in the Court of Sessions should be
taken to be part of the stated case, it does not disclose the presence of Judge
Langelier in the court house or even in the city of Quebec at the time when the defendant's trial began.

[Page 91]

In the view I take, however, it is unnecessary
to determine these points.

For the purpose of disposing of the question now
under consideration I shall assume (without so deciding) that it has been
established by material proper for our consideration that Judge Langelier,
though not present in court, was in fact in his chambers at the court house
when the trial began. The defendant and his counsel appear not to have been
aware of that fact, however, until after the trial had concluded and may
therefore be excused for not having taken exception before or during it to the
jurisdiction of the presiding judge.

Acting under Art. 3262(a) of the R.S.Q. (enacted
by 5 Geo. V., ch. 52, sec. 3) Judge Choquette was empowered to hold the Court
of Sessions of the Peace only

in case of the absence or inability to act
of one or more of the (Judges of the Court of Sessions of the Peace).

By the Order-in-Council by which he was
appointed and in his commission the judge whom he is to replace is designated
as

the Judge of the Court of Sessions of the
Peace whose residence is established in the City of Quebec.

This was Judge Langelier.

The expression ""absence or inability to
act"" should of course be given a construction at once reasonable and in
harmony with the purpose of the statute. ""Inability to act"" may or
may not involve ""absence."" It is usually accompanied by physical
absence; and absence may be due to physical inability to be present. But, as
used in the statute, ""absence"" clearly means something different from
""inability to act."" It connotes physical non-presence from whatever
cause. The question is non-presence in what place or within what area? We are
not concerned with the cause of absence.

[Page 92]

It must be presumed to be for some good and
sufficient reason (Engeman v. The State[8]), and not to be due
solely to a mere arbitrary refusal to act, since such dereliction of duty (Klaise
v. The State[9])
will not be assumed. For an instance of a statute authorising a deputy magistrate
to sit upon the mere request of the magistrate appointed to hold the court see
R.S.O. 1914, ch. 88, sec. 10.

It cannot have been the intention of the
legislature that the jurisdiction of the replacing judge and the validity of
any trial had before him should be open to question merely because it can be
shewn that when it began the Judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace was
elsewhere in the city of Quebec or even in the court house itself. Many grave
inconveniences and uncertainties in the administration of justice would result
from such a construction of the statute. It would impose upon the replacing
judge the obligation of instituting a judicial inquiry as to the whereabouts of
the Judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace before the commencement of
every trial.

""Absence,"" as used in this statute,
must, I think, be taken to mean absence from the bench, or, at the utmost,
absence from the court-room in which the trial takes place. That is a fact of
which the replacing judge can be personally cognisant when the trial is
beginning. Beyond that his actual knowledge ordinarily cannot extend. Reason
and authority would seem to concur in indicating this to be the proper
construction of what must be conceded to be an ambiguous term (Watkins v.
Mooney[10],
at pages 652-4)

seldom used without explanatory words.

Phillips v. Phillips[11], at p. 172. Thus it may

[Page 93]

necessarily import prior presence. Buchanan v.
Rucker[12],
at p. 194; or it may mean merely

not being in a particular place at the time
referred to,

without importing prior presence. Ashbury v.
Ellis[13],
at p. 345. It may imply constructive as well as actual absence. In re Brown[14], at p. 385. In its
technical meaning and standing alone it signifies ""want of
appearance."" Phillips v. Phillips[15]. In common usage
(it) simply means a state

of being away from or at a distance from,
not in company with,

Paine v. Drew[16], at p. 317; and the
words of a statute are to be taken in their ordinary familiar signification and
import. Potter's Dwarris on Statutes, p. 193.

The reference in the order-in-council and
commission to the ""residence in the city of Quebec"" of Judge Langelier are invoked by the appellant in support of
his contention that ""absence"" here means absence from that city. But
these words are not in the statute, and it is the statute that prescribes the
conditions of the jurisdiction which it confers. The language of the commission
and order-in-council cannot aid in its construction.

In Bingham v. Cabbot[17], the Supreme Court of
the United States was called upon
to determine the meaning of the word ""absent"" in a statute affecting
the constitution of Federal Circuit Courts. By sec. 4 of ch. 20 of the statute
of the 1st session of the First Congress the Federal Circuit Courts were
constituted each to consist of two Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States and the District Judge. Sec.
1 of ch. 22 of the statute of the 2nd session of the Second Congress enacted
that the attendance of only one of

[Page 94]

the Justices of the Supreme Court should be
sufficient and that

when only one Judge of the Supreme Court
shall attend any Circuit Court and the District Judge shall be absent * * *
such Circuit Court may consist of the said Judge of the Supreme Court alone.

It appeared that the District Judge was present on
the Bench but a memorandum in the margin of the record stated that he ""did
not sit in the cause."" The court said, at p. 36:—

We are perfectly clear in the opinion that,
although the District Judge was on the Bench, yet, if he did not sit in the
cause, he was absent in contemplation of law.

In Engeman v. The State[18], a similar question
arose under a New Jersey
statute of 1888 enabling the Chief Justice, or any associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of the State

in case of absence, sickness or other
inability, or vacancy in the office of the law or president judge of any county
in this State to sit or perform the duties of his office.

Van Syckle J., delivering the judgment of the
court, said, at p. 251:—

It is not necessary that the Supreme Court
Justice, before he may proceed with the business in these courts shall
institute a judicial inquiry to ascertain why the law judge is not in
attendance. ""Absence"" in this Act means non-presence in the courts;
when the law judge is temporarily away he must be presumed to be away by reason
of some inability to attend and he is absent in the statutory sense.

In Byrne v. Arnold[19], the Supreme Court of New Brunswick passed upon the construction of
the 105th section of the Canada Temperance Act, providing that

if (a) prosecution is brought before two *
* * justices no other justice shall sit or take part therein unless by reason
of their absence or the absence of one of them, etc.

The court was of the opinion that if the
justices before whom the prosecution was begun were lawfully subpoenaed as
witness, they would, although physically present in the court-room, be
""absent"" in contemplation

[Page 95]

of the statute so that two other justices might
lawfully carry on the proceeding. Allen C.J., with whom Weldon and Fraser JJ.
concurred, said at 164:

I think the word ""absence"" in
this section does not necessarily mean actual absence from the place or room
where the trial is held; but would apply to a case where the justices had, for
some cause, become incapable of sitting and taking part in the proceedings. If
such was the case I think they would be absent within the meaning of the Act,
though not absent in fact.

Palmer J. adds at 167:

When the Canada Temperance Act enacts that
when a justice is absent another can act, it does not mean that such justice is
not in any particular house or place but simply that he is not taking part in
the hearing of the case, i.e., does not form a member of the court * * *
If this construction of the Act is not correct it would be in the power of a
defendant to defeat any trial, and a construction that would lead to such a
result, I do not think is even reasonable.

In Ex parte Cormier[20], the Supreme Court of
New Brunswick, again called upon to construe a statute empowering another
magistrate to act in the absence of the police magistrate, held that

The absence intended is * * * not actual
absence from the jurisdiction or even from the place of trial, but it includes
inability to attend to the business of the court such as was proved in this
case.

The attendance of the police magistrate had been
required before another tribunal apparently sitting in the same building at the
time of the trial.

Of course the history of the legislation or the
context of the statute may indicate an intention that the word ""absence""
should receive a stricter construction. Opie v. Clancy[21], at pages 46-7-.
Compare Manners v. Ripsam[22]
with Lucas v. Ensign[23],
at p. 144.

While I think that the mention of inability to
act of the Judge of Sessions as a distinct ground upon which the replacing
judge may sit in his stead makes it clear that ""absence"" in the
statute means actual absence

[Page 96]

and not merely constructive absence such as was
held is sufficient in Bingham v. Cabbot[24], and Byrne v. Arnold[25], I am of the opinion that the ""absence"" of Judge
Langelier is sufficiently established by the admitted fact that when the trial
of the appellant began he was neither on the Bench nor in the court-room where
such trial was held. His subsequent presence would be immaterial. Reg. v.
Perkin[26];
Ex parte Cormier[27].

(2) The evidence in chief on behalf of the Crown
furnished cogent proof of a miscarriage having followed the use by the
defendant upon the person of Alice Vachon of instruments adapted to procure it.
That it was so caused was an inference clearly open. The defendant's criminal
intent was also primâ facie established since every man is presumed to
intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts. Giving evidence on
his own behalf the accused admitted having used instruments as deposed to by
the chief witness for the Crown (a matter theretofore in issue on his plea of
not guilty), but he denied his intent to procure a miscarriage, averring that
miscarriage had in fact already begun before his intervention and that his
purpose was merely to obviate septic poisoning. The defence of innocent intent
was thus set up. To rebut this defence —to aid the court in determining the
true intent of the accused, thus made the vital issue—the Crown maintains that
evidence of the use by him of similar instruments in two other cases for the
purpose of procuring miscarriage was admissible.

The objections taken by the defence to the
admissibility of this evidence are that it is irrelevant to the issue, that it
is unfair to the accused as tending to prove

[Page 97]

the commission by him of other crimes and that
he is a person of bad character, and that it contradicts him on a collateral
issue.

Answers of the accused upon purely collateral
matters are no doubt conclusive. But matter that is relevant is not purely
collateral. Moreover, that the evidence in question had the effect of
contradicting him on such a matter would not be a good reason for excluding it
if otherwise admissible.

It no doubt tended to impeach the defendant's
character. But that again does not form a ground for its exclusion if
admissible for other purposes. Rex v. Kurasch[28], cited by Mr. Roy
himself, makes this very clear. See too Rex v. Thompson[29].

The other objections are more serious and, in
view of the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Rex v. Pollard[30], call for careful
consideration. Counsel for the Crown maintains that the evidence in question is
relevant and admissible because in itself it tends to make it more probable
that the intent of the accused in using instruments on Alice Vachon was
criminal and not innocent and also because it established two of a number of
cases in which, according to the evidence of Alice Vachon, the accused had
stated to her that he had administered like treatment under similar
circumstances, and is corroborative of her testimony. The
passage in Alice Vachon's evidence is as follows:—

Q.—Est-ce que le médecin a essayé de vous
rassurer? R.—Oui monsieur.

Q.—Qu'est-ce qu'il vous a dit? R.—Il m’a
dit qu'il en traitait d'autres pour la même chose que moi et qu'il y en avait
que ça prenait du temps, plus de temps que moi.

Q.—Vous en a-t-il nommé des cas? R.—Il m'a
pas nommé des cas. Il m'a pas nommé les noms, mais qu'il y en avait une à
Québec ici qui restait chez eux à elle et puis qu'elle était malade la même
chose que moi, mais qu'elle était pas découragée.

[Page 98]

Q.—Vous a-t-il parlé de d'autres aussi,
mademoiselle? R.—Oui, il m'a dit qu'il y en avait deux ou trois qu'il soignait
comme ça.

This testimony counsel for the Crown maintains
affords some evidence that procuring abortion was systematic with the accused.

In Pollard's Case[31], basing its decision
on Rex v. Bond[32],
the Ontario Court of Appeal held that testimony similar to that given in the
case at bar by Bernadette Cleremont née Cloutier and Laetitia Cloutier had been
improperly admitted in the absence of other evidence of a system of the
existence of which a single prior criminal act of the same kind would not
afford any proof.

In Makin v. Attorney-General for New
South Wales[33],
at p. 65, Lord Herschell formulated the rule in these terms, which have been
accepted as authoritative in all subsequent cases:—

It is undoubtedly not competent for the
prosecution to adduce evidence tending to shew that the accused has been guilty
of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment, for the purpose of
leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his criminal
conduct or character to have committed the offence for which he is being tried.
On the other hand, the mere fact that the evidence adduced tends to shew the
commission of other crimes does not render it inadmissible if it be relevant to
an issue before the jury, and it may be so relevant if it bears upon the
question whether the acts alleged to constitute the crime charged in the
indictment were designed or accidental or to rebut a defence which would
otherwise be open to the accused.

This language is expressly approved of by the
House of Lords in Rex v. Ball[34].
In Rex v. Wyatt[35],
Lord Alverstone, after citing it, quoted from the judgment of Lord Russell of
Killowen C.J. in Reg. v. Rhodes[36],
at p. 81, the following passage:—

It seems to me quite clear that if the
transactions with Elston and Chambers had taken place before that with Bays at
a period not too remote, the evidence of Elston and Chambers would have been
admissible against the prisoner.

[Page 99]

The transactions with them were similar to that
charged in the indictment. At p. 193 Lord Alverstone concludes:—

The evidence objected to was clearly
admissible as tending to establish a systematic course of conduct on the part
of the accused and as negativing any accident or mistake or the existence of
any reasonable or honest motive.

""These last words,"" says Jelf J., in Rex
v. Bond[37],
at p. 412, ""are equivalent to and confirm Lord Herschell's expression

to rebut a defence which would be otherwise
open to the accused.

As Darling J. points out in the same case, at p.
409, Lord Herschell did not mean

that such evidence might be called to rebut
any defence possibly open but of an intention to rely on which there was no
probability whatever. Here, however, the evidence was called to overthrow a
defence already set up and admitted to be the defendant's answer to the charge.

In the latest reported case that I have found, Rex
v. Thompson[38],
Lord Reading C.J. said, at p. 632:—

There is no doubt as to the principles of
law applicable to this case; they are well settled and in recent years have
been frequently discussed and approved, and notably by the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council, in Makin v. Attorney-General for New South
Wales[39],
and by the House of Lords in R. v. Ball[40]. The general rule is that
the evidence tendered must be relevant to the charge for which the accused
is being tried. If the evidence merely proves, or tends to prove, that the
accused is of such evil character or disposition that he is likely to have
committed the offence charged against him, it is irrelevant and is
inadmissible. If it tend? to prove that the accused committed the crime
charged against him it is relevant and admissible, notwithstanding that
incidentally it may also prove, or tend to prove, that the accused is a person
of criminal or immoral character or disposition. Reg. v. Ollis (per Channell
J.)[41]; Perkins
v. Jeffery[42].
The difficulty lies in the application of this general rule to particular
cases.

This judgment was affirmed in the House of
Lords, 13 Crim. App. R. 61[43].

[Page 100]

In Rex v. Boyle and Merchant[44], at p. 347, the same
learned Chief Justice, discussing the admissibility against a defendant charged
with demanding money with menaces of evidence of other recent transactions
similar in all respects to that charged, said

We think that the ground upon which such
evidence is admissible is that it is relevant to the question of the real
intent of the accused in doing the acts. Its object is to negative such a
defence as mistake or accident or absence of criminal intent and to
prove the guilty mind which is the necessary ingredient of the offence charged.
* * * In the recent case of Mason v. Rex[45], this court followed
the decision in Reg. v. Rhodes[46],
and came to the conclusion that the evidence of similar transactions subsequent
to the charge was admissible in order to rebut the defence set up.

Avory J., quoting the foregoing language with
approval in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Perkins
v. Jeffrey[47],
at p. 708, preceded it with this statement:—

But it is, we think, open to doubt whether
evidence is admissible to prove a ""system or course of conduct""
unless it is relevant to negative accident or mistake or to prove a
particular intention.

In Rex. v. Shellaker[48], on a prosecution for
unlawfully and carnally knowing a girl under 16, evidence of previous acts and
conduct of the accused tending to shew that he had previously had connection
with the girl was held admissible, as Isaacs C.J. said, citing Reg. v. Ollis[49], for the purpose of
shewing intent. See too Rex v. Smith,[50]; Reg. v. Francis[51]; Archbold's Criminal
Pleading Evidence and Practice, 25th ed. (1918), 345 et seq. Roscoe's
Criminal Evidence, 12th ed., p. 80.

In Rex v. Fisher[52], Channell J., speaking
for the Court of Criminal Appeal, said at p. 152:—

[Page 101]

The principle is clear, however, and if the
principle is attended to I think it will usually be found that the difficulty
of applying it to a particular case will disappear. The principle is that the
prosecution are not allowed to prove that the prisoner has committed the
offence with which he is charged by giving evidence that he is a person of bad
character and one who is in the habit of committing crimes, for that is
equivalent to asking the jury to say that because the prisoner has committed
other offences he must therefore be guilty of the particular offence for which
he is being tried. But if the evidence of other offences does go to prove that
he committed the offence charged, it is admissible because it is relevant to
the issue, and it is admissible not because, but notwithstanding that, it
proves that the prisoner has committed another offence.

And at p. 153:

If all the cases had been frauds of a
similar character shewing a systematic course of swindling by the same method,
then the evidence would have been admissible.

The passage first quoted from the Fisher Case[53] is approved in Rex v.
Rodley[54],
at p. 472. In Rex v. Ball[55],
a case of incest, the House of Lords upheld the admission of evidence of
previous incestuous relations between the defendants to establish, as Lord
Loreburn C. says, at p. 71, that

the proper inference from their occupying
the same bedroom and the same bed was an inference of guilt or—which is the
same thing, in another way—that the defence of innocent being together as
brother and sister ought to fail.

This, says Avory J. in Rex v. Rodley54,
at p. 473,

comes within the rule previously indicated
that (such) evidence is admissible to rebut a defence really in issue.

In Reg. v. Ollis[56], the defendant was
charged with obtaining money on three worthless cheques. To prove guilty
knowledge the prosecutor on a former charge against the accused (of which he
had been acquitted), based on a like use of a single worthless cheque, was
called and gave evidence that he had been induced to give the accused his
cheque by a false representation that another cheque taken in exchange was

[Page 102]

good. A strong court held the evidence
admissible, Lord Russell of Killowen C.J. saying, at p. 76:—

It is impossible to say that all these
facts were not relevant as shewing an intention to defraud. The fact of
the dishonour of the first cheque might, and perhaps ought to, have been
capable of explanation, but it is impossible to say that it was not relevant.

Channell J., at p. 782, gives a very apt
illustration of the principle as applied to a case of passing counterfeit coin.

In part the syllabus in The People v.
Hodge[57],
reads as follows:—

Where defendant on trial for manslaughter
in procuring an abortion, admitted the abortion, but claimed that he believed
that the operation was necessary, and that he performed it without criminal
intent, evidence that he had performed a similar operation on another woman for
the purpose of producing an abortion was admissible on the issue of intent.

See too The People v. Seaman[58], at p. 357 et seq.

I do not cite Reg. v. Dale[59], referred to by Mr.
Justice Cross, because, although very much in point, and an opinion of Charles
J., whom Lord Alverstone in Rex v. Thomson[60], at p. 22, speaks of
as ""a great authority,"" it has been adversely commented upon by that
learned Chief Justice at p. 396 and by Lawrence J., at p. 424, in Rex v.
Bond[61],
the case which probably calls for the most careful consideration.

That case involved a charge similar to that now
before us. The accused had admitted to Crown witnesses that he had used
instruments on the complainant but ""suggested"" that it was for a
lawful purpose and with no criminal intent.

That was substantially his defence. The evidence
of one Taylor, that he had
performed a like operation upon her to procure a miscarriage, was admitted to
shew criminal intent. She added, however, that the

[Page 103]

accused had told her ""he had put dozens of
girls right."" The judgments are very carefully and, if I may be permitted
to say so, as was usual with that learned judge, very accurately analysed by
Osier J.A. in Rex v. Pollard[62],
with the probable exception of that of A. T. Lawrence J. As Mr. Justice Osier
says, at p. 99:—

The point (in Pollard's Case62)
was not actually decided in the recent case of The King v. Bond[63], but it would seem
from the opinions of the majority of the judges who took part in the decision
that the evidence was not in the circumstances admissible. * * * In the case
before us the evidence of system which carried the day against the accused in The
King v. Bond (supra), or anything approaching it, which would let in
proof of a single prior criminal act as part of a system is wanting; and
therefore, in my opinion, the conviction of the prisoners cannot stand (p.
102).

The evidence of system referred to was the
statement of the prisoner in the Bond Case63 made
to the Crown witness Taylor that, ""he had put dozens of girls right.""
Pollard's Case62, therefore, is authority for the
admissibility on the issue of intent of proof of a single prior criminal act of
like nature provided some proof is first given of a system of which it may form
part.

Of the seven judges who heard the appeal in the Bond
Case63, two, Alverstone C.J. and Ridley J.,
thought the evidence of the prior act inadmissible apparently because the
defence was not accident or mistake and the evidence of system was in their
opinion insufficient.

Jelf J. and. Darling J. thought the evidence
admissible without reference to the statement of the accused as to his
treatment of dozens of other girls, and that the fact that it was a single
instance affected only its weight and not its admissibility. The reasoning of
Darling J., at pp. 409-10, is very cogent. He concludes:—

Taylor's evidence went to prove that,
contrary to the defendant's allegation in defence as to his being engaged in
doing a lawful act, he

[Page 104]

was doing a thing which, in his view, was
apt to procure abortion, and that because it was so he had already done it with
that unlawful avowed knowledge and purpose. This evidence, therefore, tends to
prove that the defendant had, in repeating his former conduct, an intention
different from that alleged by him in his defence, so it is not foreign to the
point of it nor less relevant because it goes to prove the charge in the
indictment.

Jelf J., at p. 413, says:—

Upon the question whether there was or was
not a design on the prisoner's part to procure the miscarriage of Ethel Jones
evidence that on another occasion he had done the same thing with similar
instruments under similar circumstances with that design upon another girl
seems to me to have a definite bearing. The fact that only one other case was
brought forward and that case nine months old, goes in my mind, only to the
weight, and not to the admissibility of the evidence. The subject of inquiry is
the state of mind of the prisoner when he used the instruments upon Ethel Jones
and the improbability that on one occasion under precisely similar
circumstances he should have the design to procure a miscarriage, and on the
other occasion should have another and an innocent object would tend to shew
(and that is all that is necessary) that he had the bad design in regard to
Ethel Jones. Of course, if instances are multiplied, the weight of the evidence
is greatly increased, and if a system is shewn it may be irresistible. But to
my mind it is quite unnecessary to shew a system which is only a question of
degree.

Kennedy J., if there had not been anything more,
would have excluded the evidence of a single prior act done nine months before
as affording no just ground of an inference of guilty intent in the case on
trial. Citing Reg. v. Cooper[64],
at pp. 549-50, however, he thought the statement made by the prisoner to the
witness Taylor could not be excluded and amounted to proof of a course of
conduct sufficient to render proof of the prior operation admissible as
evidence of an act that formed part of such course of conduct and warranting an
inference of a systematic pursuit of the same criminal object. A single
instance of a former similar offence is in his opinion relevant without proof
of system only to rebut a defence of accident or mistake.

I confess my inability to understand how
evidence

[Page 105]

of a single prior similar act can be relevant to
an issue of design versus accident or mistake, if it be wholly irrelevant to an
issue of criminal versus innocent intent.

A. T. Lawrence J., as I read his judgment,
distinctly held evidence of the former offence admissible as relevant on the
issue of intent. He says, at p. 420:—

The relevance depends upon the issues
actually in contest; whenever it is in issue whether the prisoner, though he
did the act alleged, did it without any intention, i.e., accidentally,
or without any criminal intention, i.e., innocently, such evidence may
be given.

*********

If the act charged is manifestly an
intentional act, but the defence is that it was honestly or properly done, such
evidence is admissible to rebut this defence by shewing knowledge of some fact
essential to guilty knowledge or by shewing that in other cases similar acts
have been committed by the prisoner by the like means under the like
circumstances. The number of cases and the peculiarity of the circumstances
tend to shew the improbability of the innocent intention (p. 421).

The mind of the prisoner can only be
revealed by his words or by his acts. It is in many cases impossible to form a
sound conclusion upon the state of his mind at a given moment, unless his words
and acts under similar circumstances are subjected to investigation. It is for
this reason that I think the words of Lord Herschell—""to rebut a defence
which would otherwise be open to the accused""—are an essential part of the
proposition of law. This idea is also expressed by Lord Alverstone C.J. in Rex
v. Wyatt[65],
when he says that such evidence is admissible as negativing any accident or
mistake or the existence of any reasonable or honest motive.

Any statement of the law which omits this
latter part of the proposition would seriously cramp the administration of
justice and cannot be supported upon principle.

*********

In all cases in order to make evidence of
this class admissible there must be some connection between the facts of the
crime charged in the indictment and the facts proved in evidence. In proximity
of time, in method, or in circumstances there must be a nexus between the two
sets of facts otherwise no inference can be safely deduced therefrom (p. 424).

The learned judge concluded:—

It is impossible without reversing a long
series of cases to say that the evidence of Taylor was not admissible. It shewed that the illness of the prosecutrix
was the result of design, and not of accident; it shewed that the prisoner's
scheme or system when the indulgence of

[Page 106]

his passions had got girls into trouble was
to use these instruments upon them to relieve himself from the burden of
paternity; it tended to rebut the defence he set up of an innocent
operation, and to negative any reasonable or honest motive for its performance.

It seems to me with respect, to be reasonably
clear that Mr. Justice Lawrence agreed with Darling and Jelf JJ. rather than
with Kennedy and Bray JJ., as Mr. Justice Osier appears to have thought.

No doubt, however, as put by Osier J.A., it was

the evidence of system which carried the
day against the accused in The King v. Bond[66].

It led Kennedy and Bray JJ. to hold the evidence
in question admissible thus supporting the conclusion of Darling, Jelf, and
Lawrence JJ. in favour of dismissing the appeal. While the Bond Case66,
therefore, certainly cannot be cited as an authoritative decision for the
admission of evidence of the commission by the accused of another similar
offence, if unaccompanied by some other similar evidence of system, to prove
criminal intent where that is in issue, or to rebut a defence of innocent or
lawful purpose, the reasoning of Darling, Jelf, and Lawrence JJ. seems to me
unanswerable. With Jelf J. I am of the opinion that whatever objection there
may be to evidence of a single other similar offence goes to its weight only
and not to its admissibility. It

tends to rebut the defence (of innocent
purpose) which would be otherwise open to the accused

(Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales[67])—

to rebut the defence set up,

(Mason v. Rex[68])—

to rebut a defence really in issue,

(Rex v. Rodley[69])—

[Page 107]

to overthrow a defence already set up and
admitted to be the defendant's answer to the charge

Rex v. Bond[70],
per Darling J.—

Its object is to negative the defence of absence
of criminal intent (Rex v. Boyle and Merchant[71]), to establish that
the defence of innocent conduct should fail (Rex v. Ball[72]), to prove a
particular intention (Perkins v. Jeffrey[73]).
With Lord Russell C.J. I find it impossible to say that such evidence is not
relevant (Reg. v. Ollis[74]),
inasmuch as it tends to make more probable the criminal intent regarding which,
in view of the defence set up, it was essential that the Crown should not leave
room for reasonable doubt. How far it does so is a question of degree which
affects its weight not its admissibility; see the speech of Lord Atkinson in Rex
v. Thompson[75],
at p. 72.

But while I think the evidence of the Cleremont
and Cloutier women was admissible without and apart from any evidence of
system, we have in the passage quoted from, the testimony of Alice Vachon, an
admission by the accused of his practice or system of procuring abortions quite
as clear and strong as was that deposed to by the witness Taylor in the Bond
Case70 and deemed sufficient by Kennedy and
Bray JJ. to render admissible evidence of another like offence committed by the
accused. The evidence here is of two like offences in the commission of which
the method pursued was so similar to that adopted in the accused's treatment of
Alice Vachon that the necessary nexus is clear notwithstanding that they took
place, one, two years, and the other, four or five years before.

The admissibility of the evidence could probably
be

[Page 108]

upheld also on the ground that it is
corroborative of the testimony of Alice Vachon that the accused had told of
having treated other girls in the same manner. Rex v. Chitson[76].

The weight of the testimony was, of course, for
the consideration of the trial judge in this case, as it would have been for
that of a jury had the trial been by jury, I entertain no doubt whatever that
the evidence objected to was admissible.

Nor have I any doubt that the evidence was
properly received in rebuttal. It was offered to meet the defence of innocent
purpose put forward by the accused. While such a defence was always open, there
was no probability of its being set up until the prisoner gave his testimony.
It was then actually in issue. Rex v. Bond[77], at pp. 409, 420. The
evidence was offered to rebut the respondent's denial of criminal intent and,
according to the view stated in a very recent criminal case, could not properly
have been admitted for that purpose until that defence was definitely put
forward. Avory J. in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in
Perkins v. Jeffery[78],
said, at p. 708:

Having regard to what was said in the House
of Lords in the case of Rex v. Christie[79], as to the practice in
a criminal case of guarding against the accused being prejudiced by evidence
which though admissible would probably have a prejudicial influence on the
minds of the jury out of proportion of its true evidential value, we think that
such evidence as to other occasions should not be admitted unless and until the
defence of accident or mistake, or absence of intention to insult, is
definitely put forward.

But as Osier J.A. said in Rex v. Pollard[80], at p. 103, in answer
to the contention of the appellants that the evidence objected to, if
admissible, should have formed part of the Crown's case in the first instance
and that it was erroneous to admit it in reply:—

[Page 109]

In my view, however, the point is of no
importance. If admissible at all, the evidence might, by leave of and in the
discretion of the trial judge, be given at either stage of the case for the
purpose of disproving honesty of motive, if that were the defence relied upon,
or of rebutting a defence of accident or mistake, or to contradict the
defendant on a point material to the charge, as in The King v. Biggins[81].

In Rex v. Crippen[82], the Court of Criminal
Appeal held that:

Where evidence which is relevant to the
issue is tendered by the prosecution to rebut the case set up by the defence it
is for the judge at the trial to determine in his discretion whether such
evidence should be allowed to be given or not. Even if the judge exercised his
discretion in a way different from that in which the Court of Criminal Appeal
would have exercised it, that affords no ground for quashing the conviction of
the prisoner. If, however, it is shewn in any case that the prosecution has
done something unfair which has resulted in injustice to the prisoner the Court
of Appeal may interfere.

Here the learned judge when admitting the
testimony of Cleremont and Clouthier definitely informed the defendant that he
would have the fullest opportunity of meeting it by calling any further
evidence he might wish in sur-rebuttal and offered him an adjournment for that
purpose; and the defendant actually gave evidence in contradiction of that
given by those witnesses.

Not only was the evidence in my opinion properly
admitted but every care was taken that the accused should suffer no possible
injustice by its reception in rebuttal.

The appeal fails and should be dismissed.

Brodeur J.—I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.
The reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin and of Mr. Justice Lemieux
having been communicated to me, I concur in those reasons.

Lemieux C.J. (ad hoc).—On the 15th May, 1917, Brunet, a physician,
was convicted, before Judge

[Page 110]

Choquette, at Quebec, of practising abortion on the person of one Alice Vachon, and
sentenced for such crime to five years in the penitentiary (303 Crim. Code).

Before passing sentence, the judge at Brunet's
request reserved for the decision of the Court of King's Bench, the two
following questions:—

1. Whether the presiding judge had
jurisdiction to hear and determine the case;

2. Whether certain evidence adduced in
rebuttal by the Crown was legal or not.

Appellant Brunet has contended, as well before
the Court of King's Bench as before the present court, that Judge Choquette had
no jurisdiction to hear and determine the case and that the evidence in reply
put in by the Crown was illegal and prejudicial to the accused inasmuch as the
trial judge had relied on such evidence to convict the appellant.

First
Question.

Validity of the evidence in rebuttal or in reply
adduced by the Crowm

As stated in the record of the reserved case, it
was proved by the prosecution that the accused had, on the 13th, 14th, 15th and
16th days of July, 1916, used certain surgical instruments on the person of one
Alice Vachon, an unmarried female, who was pregnant at the time, for the
purpose of procuring her miscarriage.

The Crown, in making its proof in chief, adduced
the evidence of the girl upon whom the illegal operation had been performed as
well as medical evidence of the symptoms of Alice Vachon and of the mutilated
condition of the fœtus and then rested its case.

Brunet, the accused, thought proper to be
examined in his own behalf and stated, as a witness, that the instruments used
by him on the person of Alice Vachon

[Page 111]

were so used for a lawful purpose and without
any criminal intent.

In order to repel such criminal intent which the
girl's evidence would fasten on him, the following question is put to Brunet by
his attorney:—

Q.—At all the visits which Alice Vachon
made to you, she has sworn that you had worked in her body with certain
instruments to bring about abortion, at almost every one of her visits, except
in the afternoon; I ask you, is that true or not?

A.—I did not use instruments to bring about
abortion, but I used instruments to produce disinfection.

In cross-examination, he was asked by the Crown
if it was not true that, in 1914, he had procured the miscarriage of two
females living on Bridge St., Quebec
  city.

Following are the questions asked him in that
connection as well as his answers thereto:—

Q.—Now, did you not either procure the
abortion of two young girls residing on Bridge St. in the fall of 1914? Question objected to. Question allowed. A.—It
was not done, that is sure.

Q.—I put you the question whether, in the
fall of 1914, you did not procure the abortion particularly of a girl residing
on Bridge St.? Question
objected to. Objection reserved. A.—I do not recollect that.

Q.—Will you swear that that did not happen?
A.—I would have to see the person to be able to tell.

Q.—You cannot remember? A.—Why no; in 1914,
I do not remember.

The Crown, in reply or in rebuttal, heard, as
witnesses, two women, Laetitia Cloutier and Bernadette Clouthier, who testified
that the appellant had procured the miscarriage of each of them, some few years
before, by methods which resembled those described by Alice Vachon as having
been applied to her.

Brunet, heard as a witness in his own behalf,
expressly admits having used instruments on the person of Alice Vachon; he
denies however that it was with the criminal intent of procuring abortion, but
states, on the contrary, that it was for disinfection purposes.

[Page 112]

Brunet's assertion was obviously intended to
exculpate himself and to repel or disprove all evidence tending to shew that he
had employed such instruments for abortive purposes.

Under such circumstances, was the Crown entitled
to contradict Brunet, to rebut his affirmation and to examine, in reply,
witnesses to shew that Brunet, with a criminal intent, that of causing
abortion, had performed, on those very witnesses, similar practices, using
instruments like those used in the case of Alice Vachon? In this matter of
evidence in reply, the rule adopted by all the English authors is that such
evidence must not be confirmatory. Evidence in reply must, as a general rule,
be strictly confined to rebutting the defendant's case and must not merely
confirm that of the plaintiff or prosecutor.

Brunet's contention, as embodied in his
testimony, that he had used certain instruments on the person of Alice Vachon
not with a view to determining abortion but in order to produce disinfection,
purported on his behalf the allegation of a certain fact intended to establish
his good faith and dismiss any criminal intent.

Such his claim amounted to a special plea based
on a special fact which the Crown, in the examination in chief, could not
anticipate. That theory of the disinfection constituted a new fact which the
Crown had the right to disprove or rebut by evidence in reply of other facts
excluding good faith, that is to say, of similar practices previously performed
by the accused, on other persons, for a like criminal purpose.

Such evidence was not confirmatory of the
prosecutor's case, but was evidence the nature and intent of which was to rebut
the defendant's case and pretensions.

Jurisprudence or at least a list of judgments are
to the effect that the evidence to prove in reply or in rebuttal

[Page 113]

against the accused similar acts committed by
him on other occasions is legal, when the defence of absence of intent to
commit a crime is definitely put forward. It has been decided that such
evidence was admissible upon three grounds: to establish design, to rebut the
defence of accident, mistake or lack of criminal intent, and as shewing a
systematic course of conduct.

As said in Perkins v. Jeffery[83]:

There is an essential difference between
evidence tending to shew generally that the accused had a fraudulent or
dishonest mind, * * and evidence tending to shew that he had a fraudulent or
dishonest mind in the particular transaction, the subject matter of the charge,
then being investigated.

In the most recent criminal law treatise
entitled Outlines of Criminal Law, published by Kenny, Professor of the Laws of
England, 8th ed., p. 354, we find the following doctrine expounded:—

Nor is there, even in English law, any
intrinsic objection to giving evidence of the prisoner having committed other
crimes, if there be any special circumstance in the case to render those crimes
legally relevant,

*********

Whilst the fact of a prisoner having
committed other similar offences is not relevant to the question whether he
committed the actus reus of which he is accused now, yet, so soon as
this actus reus has been fully established, evidence of those previous
offences may well be relevant to the question of his state of mind in
committing this act (his mens rea) if the defendant do actually raise
that question (Rex v. Rodley)[84].
Such evidence was originally admitted only in exceptional offences where a
denial of mens rea was peculiarly easy, like embezzlement or false
pretences. But now the admissibility is recognised as a general rule in no way
limited to peculiar classes of crime.

And the author quotes a number of cases where
decisions were rendered supporting that principle.

On that ground, we find: that the evidence in
reply adduced by the Crown through the two girls Leatitia and Bernadette
Clouthier was legal inasmuch as such evidence was not confirmatory of the
prosecution's case, but was meant to disprove or deny the assertion

[Page 114]

made under oath by Brunet, of a new fact
intended to establish his good faith; that such evidence was further legal
inasmuch as it exposed or purported to expose Brunet's perverse or criminal
mind in his practices or in his use of instruments on the person of the Vachon
girl, to procure her abortion, by reason of the fact that, for a like criminal
purpose, he had previously performed in a similar way on the Clouthier girls.

Second
Question.

Had Magistrate Choquette proper jurisdiction to
hear and determine the case?

Magistrate Choquette, who tried and convicted Brunet,
is a Judge of the Sessions of the Peace, but his jurisdiction as such is
subject to a particular condition, that is to say, he may sit only in the case
of absence or inability to act of Judge Langelier, who is the regular Judge of
the Sessions of the Peace, in and for the District of Quebec.

Brunet's contention is that Magistrate Choquette
has heard and determined the information with which he was charged without due
power or jurisdiction so to do, owing to the fact that, at the time of the
trial, Judge Langelier was not absent, but that, on the contrary, he was then
present in his chambers, at the court house, Quebec city, and furthermore that
the condition to which Magistrate Choquette's jurisdiction is subject, i.e.,
the absence of Judge Langelier, does not appear in the record.

All the proceedings had in the Brunet case
before Magistrate Choquette bear, as a head-line, the statement that Magistrate
Choquette is sitting in the absence and owing to the absence of Judge
Langelier.

Such declaration in the record is supposed to be
true or implies a presumption pro tantum of truth, to wit: that Judge
Langelier was juridically absent for

[Page 115]

reasons deemed valid which it is not our
province to question or appreciate. Such presumption pro tantum could of
course be nullified and superseded by a stronger presumption or by legal
evidence, offered in the usual way of legal debate, in support of a plea
declining the jurisdiction of the court.

No such declinatory plea was ever urged in this
matter.

We read, in Broom's Legal Maxims, p. 722, that

where acts are of an official nature, or
require the concurrence of official persons, a presumption arises in favour of
their due execution. In these cases the ordinary rule is omnia prœsumuntur
rite et solleniter esse acta donec probetur in contrarium, everything is
presumed to be rightly and duly performed until the contrary is shewn. The
following may be mentioned as general presumptions of law illustrating this
maxim— that a man, in fact acting in a public capacity, was properly appointed
and is duly authorised so to act; that the records of a court of justice have
been correctly made, according to the rule, res judicata pro veritate
accipitur; that judges and jurors do nothing causelessly and maliciously;
that the decisions of a court of competent jurisdiction are well founded, and
their judgments regular, etc.

The statute, when referring to the absence of
Judge Langelier, making conditional upon such absence the jurisdiction with
which Magistrate Choquette is vested, uses a word which must be construed in a
broad and liberal acceptation. The word ""absent"" does not mean
""physically away from the district or the court house."" The juridical
construction of that word ""absence"" rather implies non-presence of
the judge on the bench or in the court-room. The reasons for the judge's
absence from the hench or the court-room may be numerous and may consist in
relationship to either of the parties in the case, in having expressed his
opinion on the matter at issue, in his feeling temporarily indisposed and in so
many other reasons ejusdem generis as may induce the judge to abstain
from attendance on the bench or in the court-room.

It is Judge Langelier himself who, in such
instances,

[Page 116]

appreciates the validity of the reasons of his
absence. He is not bound nor called upon to make a statement in writing as to
his absence and his reasons therefor or to fyle same in the record, in order to
vest Magistrate Choquette with the necessary jurisdiction.

Such absence was sufficiently established by the
statement heading the proceedings in the case: ""present, Hon. Judge
Choquette, in the absence of Judge Langelier.""

The following decision seems to conform to the
spirit of the statutory enactment under discussion as well as to common sense:
""Absent"" as used in Acts, 1888, p. 64, authorising the Chief Justice
to hold court in the absence of a law judge means non-presence in the courts.
When the law judge is temporarily away, he must be presumed to be away by
reason of some inability to attend, and he is absent in the statutory sense. The
State v. Engeman[85],
from Words and Phrases Judicially Defined, vol, 1, p. 35.

At the time when the reserved case was argued
before the Court of King's Bench, the Crown fyled a sworn declaration wherein Judge
Langelier stated that it was to his knowledge and with his consent that
Magistrate Choquette had tried the Brunet case.

Such statement, supposing it were valid or
necessary, would go to shew that Judge Langelier had agreed that the case be
heard by Magistrate Choquette, because, obviously, for one reason or another
deemed legitimate, he himself did not want to act. The above declaration would
also preclude any supposition that Magistrate Choquette might have interfered
in the case or arrogated to himself powers and jurisdiction with which he was
not legally vested.

[Page 117]

In this affair, after Brunet had been sentenced,
there took place certain formalities which, unless sternly discountenanced and
reproved by our courts of justice, might lead to serious mishaps of a nature to
interfere with the administration of justice in criminal matters.

Two months after the sentence, a clerk in the
office of the Court of Sessions of the Peace gave his affidavit wherein he
stated that Judge Langelier was present in court while Brunet was being tried.
That clerk had no authority to make such declaration which had and could have
no legal weight or value whatever. It could not avail as against the
oft-repeated statement contained in the record that Magistrate Choquette had
acted in the absence of Judge Langelier.

Other affidavits were also produced either to
deny or corroborate the entry made in the record anent the absence of Judge
Langelier. Such affidavits were not and could not be of any consequence in the
decision of the reserved case. If really Magistrate Choquette had no
jurisdiction, if he usurped the functions which he then exercised, there was
but one way, during the trial, to dispute his jurisdiction and that was by
special plea or exception. And if such want of jurisdiction only came to
appellant's knowledge after his conviction, he could yet complain by urging the
usual grounds, which he utterly failed to do.

We consequently find that Magistrate Choquette
had due jurisdiction to hear and determine the case.

I am for dismissing the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

2423980,Martinez v R [2015] NSWCCA 5,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Shawn Luis Martinez (the applicant) was sentenced by his Honour Judge Blackmore SC in the District Court on 6 March 2014 for an offence of break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely intentionally damage property by means of fire.
	
	
	The offence is contrary to s 112(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years.
	
	
	The sentence imposed was imprisonment for 3 years 10 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing on 6 March 2013.
	
	
	In sentencing for this offence the judge took into account at the applicant’s request an additional offence listed on a Form 1 document pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). That was an offence of dishonestly obtaining property by deception which is contrary to s 192E(1)(a) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.
	


Facts


	
	There was agreement as to the facts of the matter. The applicant and an associate, Marko Kovac, approached Aymen Nachar and asked him to burn down a jewellery design and wholesale business in Paddington in return for payment of $1500. The business was on the first floor of a terrace house which had a hairdressing business on the ground floor. It was surrounded by domestic premises.
	
	
	Nachar approached Mohamad Ayad and asked him to help. At a subsequent meeting of all four men there was a discussion about how the job was to be done and a description was provided of the premises.
	
	
	The applicant purchased a car on 12 October 2010 for use in the commission of the arson. He provided false details in a finance application (the Form 1 offence).
	
	
	On 20 December 2010 the applicant, Kovac and Nachar went to a hardware store where items were purchased to facilitate the offence (a crow bar, a ladder and some gloves). That night, the applicant picked up Nachar and Ayad from Nachar’s home and drove towards Paddington. He stopped to purchase a container of petrol. They met Kovac near the target premises and swapped cars. The applicant covered the number plates of the car and drove Nachar and Ayad past the premises and told them where he would be waiting for them while they did the job.
	
	
	Nachar and Ayad approached the premises on foot and, using the ladder and crow bar, broke in, spread the petrol and ignited it. They then fled to the waiting car and the applicant drove them to Nachar’s home at Warwick Farm. He gave Nachar $1450 as payment for the job.
	
	
	A call to the emergency services number was made at 2.53am on 21 December 2010 and the Darlinghurst Fire Brigade attended and extinguished the fire. The fire had caused damage worth a little over $150,000.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested on 28 April 2011 after he made incriminating statements in a covertly recorded conversation with Kovac. He declined to be interviewed. A little over a year later, after he had been committed for trial, he provided police with a typed statement in which he claimed that he had been approached to arrange the arson attack in return for $8000 by a man named Isaac Levy who had an association with the premises.
	
	
	The learned judge accepted the agreed fact that the applicant’s motive was financial gain which he considered to be an aggravating factor. The fact that he engaged others to carry out the offence was also considered to be relevant to the seriousness of the offence. He took into account that considerable damage was caused and it was another aggravating factor that the fire had the potential to spread to nearby properties.
	


The applicant’s personal circumstances


	
	The applicant was aged 28 at the time of the offence. The judge noted that he came from “a relatively privileged background”, although the applicant described his upbringing as difficult in that he felt pressured and judged by his parents. He said he was often left in care and claims to have been abused in that context.
	
	
	He attended university after school but did not complete any course. He had a meagre employment history. He had used drugs. He had been diagnosed with schizophrenia but the judge noted that Dr Jonathon Adams, forensic psychiatrist, had doubted this, preferring a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder relating to early childhood trauma. This was a condition amenable to psychological counselling. The judge determined that with the benefit of such counselling there were good prospects of rehabilitation. It was in relation to this issue that the judge found special circumstances and reduced the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period.
	
	
	The applicant’s prior criminal history comprised an offence of destroying or damaging property for which he was fined in 2002. There are also some subsequent offences which will be mentioned in more detail when dealing with the first ground of appeal.
	
	
	The applicant had provided information to police which they regarded as of “intelligence” value. He had placed himself in some danger as a result of this (the judge accepted that he had been assaulted) and had been held in protective custody, thereby limiting the availability of such services as are available in the custodial environment.
	
	
	Blackmore DCJ had earlier sentenced Nachar and Ayad. From starting points of 5 years and 4 years 9 months before discounting for their pleas and assistance he imposed sentences of 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year 8 months (Nachar) and 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months (Ayad). After referring to the sentencing of these men, his Honour indicated that the appropriate starting point for the applicant’s sentence would be 5 years 6 months. After allowing 30 per cent for the plea of guilty and assistance he imposed the sentence earlier mentioned, namely 3 years 10 months with a non-parole period of 2 years.
	


Ground 1 – The learned sentencing judge failed to take into account all pre-sentence custody served for the Break and Enter charge and backdate the sentence accordingly


	
	By s 24(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act a court must take into account “any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence”, and by s 47(3), in deciding whether to backdate the commencement of a sentence, such time must be taken into account. Backdating a sentence to allow credit for pre-sentence custody is the usual and preferable course: Wiggins v R [2010] NSWCCA 30 at [2] (McClellan CJ at CL) and [3]-[8] (Howie J).
	
	
	The applicant was in custody for a considerable time prior to sentence but part of it related to his bail refusal for other offences as well.
	
	
	On 27 June 2012, whilst on bail for the present matter, the applicant was charged with possessing and using a travel document not issued to himself (the Commonwealth offences). On 9 September 2012 he was charged with three offences of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception (the State offences). These offences all occurred on 25 – 27 June 2012. The applicant had taken $46,000 from his brother’s bank account and flown to China using his brother’s passport. He was refused entry and was returned to Australia. These offences occurred whilst the applicant was on very strict bail on the arson charge.
	
	
	These charges were finalised prior to sentencing for the present matter and resulted in recognizances for the Commonwealth offences and good behaviour bonds for the State offences.
	
	
	The following table sets out the pre-sentence charging and custodial chronology.
	



	
		
			
			28.4.11
			
			
			Arrest, charge and refusal of bail for arson offence
			
		
		
			
			9.6.11

			Sentenced for Commonwealth and State offences (released on recognizance and bonds) but remained bail refused for arson offence
			
		
		
			
			6.3.14
			
			
			Sentenced for arson offence
			
		
	



	
	The following propositions emerge:
	


The applicant was in custody for 1 month 13 days from arrest until he was released on bail for the arson offence (28.4.11 – 9.6.11).

Following his return to custody after being charged with the Commonwealth offences he remained in custody for 1 year 8 months 8 days prior to being sentenced for the arson offence (27.6.12 – 6.3.14).

His custody referrable to the Commonwealth and State offences prior to sentencing for them amounted to 10 months 19 days (27.6.12 – 15.5.13).

His custody solely referrable to the arson offence in respect of the period 28 April 2011 to 9 June 2011 (1 month 13 days) and 15 May 2013 to 6 March 2014 (9 months 20 days) amounted to 11 months 3 days.

His custody whilst bail refused for the arson offence, partially coinciding with being bail refused for the Commonwealth and State offences, amounted to 1 year 9 months 20 days (28.4.11 – 9.6.11 and 28.6.12 – 6.3.14).


	
	The applicant contends that the judge should have allowed him the benefit of the entire period in which he had been bail refused in respect of the arson offence (1 year 9 months 20 days). Instead, his Honour took into account that the applicant had been simultaneously bail refused in respect of the Commonwealth and State offences for part of that period. He said:
	


“I will make a further allowance on sentence based on the principles of totality, such as I will backdate the sentence to be applied in his case. In that regard I will commence the sentence 12 months before the final date of sentence to reflect that backdating.”


	
	The applicant submitted that the time in which he had been held in custody for the Commonwealth and State offences was not taken into account by the Local Court when he was sentenced and placed on bonds and recognizances for those matters. As a result, all of the custody should have been taken into account in the District Court.
	
	
	I do not accept this submission. The transcript of the Local Court proceedings was tendered by senior counsel for the applicant at the sentence hearing. It shows that Longley LCM first determined applications under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) and s 20BQ of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) for dismissal and conditional release in respect of the Commonwealth and State charges on account of the applicant’s mental condition. His Honour refused the applications.
	
	
	During the course of submissions on the applications it was noted that the applicant had spent some 11 months in custody, bail refused, in respect of those charges and the arson charge. A relevant factor in relation to the applications was the likely outcome of proceedings whereby the magistrate indicated tentative agreement with the proposition that the pre-sentence custody would leave alternatives to a fulltime custodial sentence open to be imposed. This was said in the context of the magistrate also regarding the offences objectively as “serious matters”.
	
	
	Following the dismissal of the applications the magistrate noted that if the applicant had been dealt with 11 months earlier he would potentially have received a sentence of less than 12 months. He asked the applicant’s solicitor to obtain instructions about the plea to be entered, indicating further that he had in mind the imposition of bonds and recognizances. Pleas of guilty were then entered and such orders were made. The magistrate gave short reasons, including: “He has spent as I say since 27 June in custody”.
	
	
	There is force in the Crown’s submission in this Court that the imposition of bonds for such serious matters in the Local Court would have been “extraordinarily lenient” if the pre-sentence custody was not taken into account.
	
	
	It is also pertinent to note that this Court is not concerned with the correctness of the approach taken by the Magistrate in taking into account pre sentence custody (see, for example, R v Newman; R v Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102; 145 A Crim R 361 at [24]-[32]. This Court is only concerned with the fact that the magistrate proceeded as he did.
	
	
	In the District Court, senior counsel for the applicant first indicated that he was seeking the full benefit of the time his client had been in custody bail refused for the arson offence. He later conceded that in some fashion the time the applicant had been in custody was a factor taken into account by the magistrate in imposing the sentences that he did. There was then the following exchange:
	


“HIS HONOUR: I think it’s reasonably clear that his Honour made a pragmatic decision. … he has or had already spent as [much?] time as he would spend in custody so I’ll put him on a bond.”

LLOYD: That largely would appear also because of his mental health position at the time. We don’t have the reports that were tendered to his Honour but his Honour says in the end he clearly is ill and I want to make it a condition of a bond that he attend upon a doctor. One thing we do know is he was never released because he was bail refused on these offences so his mental condition loomed large there. I do submit your Honour would take it at least partly into account when assessing an appropriate sentence and backdating any sentence, not fully, but partly.” (Emphasis added)


	
	In the course of submissions by the prosecutor, it was conceded that some allowance should be made but it was submitted that the applicant should not receive the full benefit of the pre-sentence custody. The judge indicated that he did not understand the applicant’s counsel to be seeking the full benefit but said that there was “an issue about totality”. The prosecutor responded to the effect that in that case, “we’re probably not at odds”. It seems she was right in that in his submissions in reply, senior counsel for the applicant said nothing more on the subject.
	
	
	The applicant would have twice received an allowance on sentence if the judge had taken into account all of the pre-sentence custody when the magistrate had taken into account that part of it while he was bail refused for the Commonwealth and State matters.
	
	
	There is no merit in the applicant pursuing this contention on appeal which is contrary to the position he adopted in the court below: see, for example, Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at [81].
	
	
	If this was the only ground of appeal I would refuse leave to appeal.
	


Ground 2 – The learned sentencing judge erred in finding that the sentence was in breach of a section 9 good behaviour bond


	
	In the course of his sentencing remarks the judge said:
	


“The offender was bound by the terms of a good behaviour bond at the time that he committed the offence; that of itself is a serious aggravating circumstance with respect to his offending.”


	
	The Crown concedes that the applicant was not on a bond and that this statement by the judge was erroneous. Accordingly, leave to appeal should be allowed. The Crown contends, however, that no lesser sentence is warranted: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	The applicant argues that the error would have affected the overall sentence imposed and so he should be re-sentenced to something less. This is not the issue. The point is that once error is established it becomes this Court’s duty to re-sentence unless in the exercise of its discretion it concludes that no sentence whether more or less severe is warranted and should have been passed: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37 at [35].
	
	
	I have earlier outlined the facts of the offence and the applicant’s personal circumstances. Amongst the congeries of matters relevant to sentence he had a number of favourable matters to be brought to account. However, the offence was one of significant objective seriousness. There was planning and premeditation with the engagement of others and the acquisition of equipment in order to carry out a serious act of arson. It resulted in considerable property damage and had the potential to cause far greater harm in a residential area.
	
	
	The starting points for the sentences that were imposed upon the co-offenders Nachar and Ayad (5 years and 4 years 9 months respectively) were not suggested by the applicant to be excessive. Having regard to the seriousness of the offence, the more senior role the applicant played in it, and the fact that a Form 1 offence was required to be taken into account, a lesser starting point than 5 years 6 months cannot be justified. There was no argument directed to the adequacy of the level of discounting allowed for the applicant’s plea of guilty and assistance. Accordingly, I am satisfied that no lesser sentence than the 3 years 10 months imprisonment imposed in the District Court is warranted.
	
	
	The applicant maintained the point raised under ground 1 that there should be a backdating of the sentence by a further 9 months and 20 days. This must be rejected for the reasons given earlier.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Leave to appeal against sentence granted.

2.    Appeal dismissed.


	
	CAMPBELL J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

		06 February 2015",2015-02-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2424024,Abbott v R [2015] NSWCCA 7,"Judgment


	
	HIDDEN J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Schmidt J.
	
	
	I agree with her Honour that the Crown prosecutor’s argument about the competing credibility of Mr Webb and the appellant, and the suggestion that the appellant was attempting by his evidence to discredit the complainant, does not amount to consciousness of guilt reasoning. As to the complaint that the argument is illogical, that was a matter for the jury to determine. It did not call for a judicial direction. The same is true of the allied argument which was characterised by senior counsel for the appellant as “a shortcut to conviction.”
	
	
	Viewed in isolation, the prosecutor’s rhetorical question “Who do you believe?” might convey that the verdict turned on an assessment of the credibility of the appellant against that of Crown witnesses. However, the passages from the summing-up set out in the judgment of Schmidt J could have left the jury in no doubt as to the burden of proof borne by the Crown, and the fact that the accused bore no such burden.
	
	
	On the other hand, the argument to the effect that the accused’s interest in the outcome of the proceedings was relevant to his credibility should not have been put, as the Crown prosecutor in this court acknowledged. However, after careful consideration, I accept his characterisation of it as “an unfortunate blemish” which would not have occasioned a miscarriage of justice, given that there was one brief reference to it in the prosecutor’s address and given the clear directions of the trial judge as to the burden of proof.
	
	
	I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with Schmidt J.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: In December 2013 the applicant was convicted of having wounded George Tucker with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, on the evening of 18 September 2011 at a birthday party being held at Paddington, contrary to s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The applicant appeals that conviction.
	
	
	In January 2014, Syme DCJ sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 7 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. The maximum penalty for the offence was 25 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 7 years applied to the offence.
	


The issues raised on appeal


	
	One ground of appeal was pressed, namely, that the trial miscarried by reason of statements and submissions made by the Crown prosecutor in his closing address.
	
	
	There was no issue at trial that the applicant and Mr Tucker were both guests at the party and that they had both been drinking. At one point during the evening, they and others left the party and attended a nearby hotel to watch a rugby match. Whether they had taken cocaine after they returned, and how much the applicant had drunk was in issue.
	
	
	The case turned on the credibility and reliability of the evidence given by Mr Tucker and the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant and Mr Tucker had both been on friendly terms, but during the evening antagonism arose between them. They were both later in the kitchen, together with Richard O’Dea and Pat Kelly. It was then, it was alleged, that the applicant hit Mr Tucker with a beer bottle, striking him just above the ear and cutting him with the broken bottle. Both the applicant and Mr Tucker gave evidence, as did Mr O’Dea and the host of the party, Mr Balchin. While nearby Mr O’Dea did not see the blow being struck. The applicant left the party immediately afterwards and Mr Tucker was taken to hospital, where he was treated for the cut, which required 18 stitches, as well as other minor cuts and abrasions near his hairline, and bruising and bumps on the side of his head above his left ear.
	
	
	The applicant’s case on appeal was not raised below. At the trial no objection was taken to the Crown’s address and Syme DCJ was not asked to give the jury any particular direction to deal with the matters which, on appeal, were submitted for the first time to have given rise to a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	The applicant’s case on appeal was firstly, that the Crown prosecutor ought not to have addressed as he did, because it was suggested to the jury that the applicant had a motive to lie, contrary to Robinson v R [No 2] [1991] HCA 38; 180 CLR 531, as explained in Hargraves [2011] HCA 44; 245 CLR 257 at [45] - [46].
	
	
	The prejudice which resulted for the applicant had not been removed by any direction later given by Syme DCJ. It was submitted that “[n]othing short of an explicit direction to ignore [the Crown’s] submissions (and put them aside entirely)” would have sufficed in the circumstances which had arisen.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the Crown’s address introduced consciousness of guilt reasoning, contrary to Edwards v R [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193 and Zoneff v R [2000] HCA 28; 200 CLR 234. Again the prejudice which resulted was not addressed by directions which ought to have been given by the trial judge (see Campbell [2005] NSWCCA 132 at [36] - [43]).
	
	
	Objection was also taken to the suggestion that the applicant had lied in his evidence as to what he had drunk in order to discredit another witness, which was a sufficient basis for the jury to reject the rest of his evidence. This was submitted to have amounted to an impermissible “short cut to conviction.”
	
	
	Finally, objection was taken to the Crown having posed the question “Who do you believe?” That, it was submitted, went to the heart of the accusatorial process and the burden of proof discussed in Hargreaves at [39] - [46] and had resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	In the result, the leave required under s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1919 (NSW) would be granted, the appeal upheld and a retrial ordered.
	


Leave to appeal must be granted


	
	In my view leave to appeal under s 5 should be granted, given the Crown’s concession, but the appeal would have to be dismissed.
	
	
	No objections were taken at trial to any of the matters raised on appeal and no directions were sought of the trial judge, as to the aspects of the Crown’s address it is now complained gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. In these circumstances Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) applies. It provides that no omission to direct by the trial judge may be advanced as a ground for appeal without leave, unless objection was taken at the trial to the omission by the party applying for leave to appeal.
	
	
	In the circumstances of this case, leave under Rule 4 ought to be given, even though the course taken at trial was the result of forensic decisions then made by the applicant, given what was in issue. It was then plainly recognised that the way in which the Crown put its case did not amount to a miscarriage of justice and did not require further directions to be given by the trial judge, given the written and oral directions which were in fact given.
	
	
	The case turned entirely on the truthfulness and reliability of evidence called by the Crown and that given by the applicant. The applicant elected to give evidence and accordingly, his evidence was subject to the same tests which are generally applicable to witnesses in a criminal trial: Robinson v The Queen at 536.
	
	
	Syme DCJ instructed the jury at the outset that the Crown had to prove the charge to which the applicant had pleaded not guilty, beyond reasonable doubt. The jury was also instructed that they would have to assess the witnesses’ evidence and that they did not have to accept or reject the whole of any witness’ evidence, but could accept or reject a part of the witness’ evidence, if there was a logical and proper reason to do so.
	
	
	The Crown’s case was circumstantial. It was opened by the Crown on the basis that it had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had wounded Mr Tucker at the time and place alleged, intending to cause him grievous bodily harm. The evidence which Mr Tucker and other witnesses were expected to give was outlined and the jury was informed that none of them would say that they had seen the applicant wound Mr Tucker. The jury was not at that point addressed by counsel for the applicant.
	
	
	Evidence was called by the Crown from Mr Tucker, Mr Balchin, Mr O’Dea, Mr Webb and Detective Senior Constable Walker and various things were tendered. The applicant then gave evidence.
	
	
	The applicant’s evidence as to how much alcohol he had consumed conflicted with that given by Mr Webb, who had not consumed any alcohol at the party. Mr Webb’s credit was not challenged. The applicant’s evidence about the altercation with Mr Tucker and that given by Mr Tucker, also conflicted. Their credit was in issue. The jury thus had to decide whose evidence they would accept on critical matters. Whether the jury would prefer the applicant’s evidence over that of Mr Webb, was, in the circumstances, important to how the conflict between the evidence of Mr Tucker and the applicant would be resolved.
	
	
	The Crown then addressed the jury on these matters.
	
	
	The first parts of the address quoted below, which are highlighted in bold, were relied on appeal, to establish the miscarriage of justice claimed. It is important to see those parts of the Crown’ address in their context. It was submitted, by the Crown, as to the witnesses’ evidence:
	


“I told you again in my opening and it’s important that you understand that the Crown does not have to prove every word of every witness beyond a reasonable doubt. What the Crown has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt are those essential elements. And if you think about it for a minute when you had realised that when a witness comes before you to give their evidence what they are telling you is what their recollections are of an event that occurred in this case over two years ago and your common sense and your experience of life will be telling you that when a number of people are present when an event occurs and later asked to recount what that event was they will give different versions of what they saw or heard, and that’s because different people have different abilities. Some people are more observant than others and some people maybe[sic] affected, certainly in this case, by alcohol, it may have been a stressful or an anxious type of situation, as in this case, so it may be something that you would expect that when a number of people have given evidence about the same event they give different versions. You may think that that’s not unusual at all.

You may think that when these witnesses before you gave their evidence and obviously some had better recollections than others. Some were affected by alcohol and if my memory serves me correctly that some said that there were some incidents that they remember and some that they were very hazy about.

What the Crown has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, as I told you the other day, the essential elements of the count before you and those essential elements, and I have no doubt that her Honour will give you some written directions of what the elements are, but they are that it was the accused that wounded Mr Tucker, that when he inflicted the wound he had an intent to cause grievous bodily harm and, in fact, grievous bodily harm was inflicted.

(236-237)


	
	As to credibility it was submitted:
	


“You are also going to be asked to make determinations about the credibility or the believability of the witnesses that you have seen and heard in this case, the accused, for example, and Mr Tucker. In other words you are going to be asked whether or not those witnesses are worthy of belief. And if you think about that for a moment also that is again something you do everyday in your lives, you make decisions about the acceptability of people. We have all had experiences of people that we know and if they told us something we would accept it outright. We perhaps also know people that exaggerate or may be forgetful or may be who are event deceitful. And your experience of life as a member of the community will also tell you that when you come to decide about whether a person is worthy of belief you will find it important to not only to listen to what the person says, but to observe them and see the manner in which they say it.” (238)


	
	As to assessing the witnesses it was submitted:
	


“Her Honour told you at the opening of the trial that when assessing witnesses you didn’t have to accept all that a witness told you, you didn’t have to reject all that a witness told you, you’re entitled to accept parts of the evidence and reject parts of the evidence. What you accept and what you reject it’s a matter for you. And an example of that is, for example, Mr Balchin, who said he was affected by alcohol, some things that he could remember clearly and others that he couldn’t Mr Tucker also said to you that some parts of the night were just a blur. So you can accept if you wish to accept parts of the evidence and reject parts.

It’s also important I would suggest to you that to assess the witness and first of all determine whether they are telling you the truth, that is, is the witness genuinely trying to assist you and give an accurate version. Obviously, because if they are not it’s not going to be of any assistance to you and you may reject the evidence entirely. Once you accept the witness as reliable you then look at the second aspect, that is once you accept the witness as truthful then you look to see if the witnesses were reliable. The witness may be trying to do their best to assist you and give an accurate account of what occurred, but their memory may be so bad or affected by alcohol that they are just wrong.

An example of credibility and reliability may be the comparison between the accused and Mr Webb, who was the last civilian witness. You will recall that Mr Webb, who did not drink on that night and who left at about 1.30, said that in his opinion - somebody who was sober, not drinking - that the accused was the drunkest person at the party. Compare that to the accused’s version, who said he had six drinks over a six hour period. If you accept Mr Webb’s evidence, and I suggest you should, because there was no motive for him to give you a version which is not accurate or truthful, if you accept Mr Webb then you would reject the accused’s evidence that he only had six drinks in a six hour period. And if you reject or accept Mr Webb you might ask yourself why the accused said that he only had six drinks in that six hour period. Was he not telling you the truth? Was he trying [to] colour his evidence to make his evidence more acceptable, more credible? Was he trying to discredit Mr Tucker? Who agrees that he had a lot to drink and also ingested cocaine, as he tried to, by inference, suggest to you that his, that is the accused’s version, is more accurate than Mr Tucker. 

But if you reject the accused’s evidence in relation to how much he had to drink that night and you accept Mr Webb you may think that the reasons for the accused telling you that he only had a small amount to drink is sufficient for you to reject his evidence outright, because if he’s not telling you truth in relation to how much he had to drink and you infer the reason for him not telling you will give you an accurate estimate of how much he had to drink and what his state of intoxication was, was to discredit somebody else, in particular Mr Tucker then you might think that the whole of his evidence is just not worthy of being accepted by you. And that would be my submission, that one piece of evidence alone is sufficient for you to reject the evidence of the accused, because he’s obviously not trying to assist you, he’s not telling you the truth, the reasons are that he’s trying to discredit Mr Tucker and the reason why he’s trying to discredit Mr Tucker is because Mr Tucker gives an accurate account of what occurred.”  (238- 239)


	
	As to motive it was submitted:
	


“You might also when assessing witnesses look to see if a witness had a particular - or had a motive to give a particular version. 

Mr Webb, I suggest to you, has not[sic] motive whatsoever.

Does Mr Tucker have a motive to suggest or to tell you on oath that it was the accused who struck him on the head and slashed his face. Why would he pick on Mr Abbott? Out of all the people there why suggest that it was Abbott who did it, or did it deliberately? Is there a motive for the accused not to give you an accurate version of what occurred? You might think that his motive is that he is facing a serious criminal charge.

As I said, who you believe and who you don’t believe is a matter for you. What parts of the evidence you accept and what parts you reject is a matter for you. But in doing that, apart from a clear comparison when two witnesses give conflicting versions, for example, Mr Webb and the accused in relation to how much they had to drink.

You may also compare the evidence of a witness with the physical evidence in the case, and the physical evidence comes from the photographs, and you might compare the evidence and the versions given by the witnesses to what’s shown in the photographs immediately after the event.” (239-240)


	
	As to the conflict in the evidence of the witnesses it was submitted:
	


“Mr Tucker you will recall, and I will be very brief, Mr Tucker said the accused struck him to the head with the bottle which left a bruise and some minor lacerations, and he indicated to you it was at his headline just above his left ear. He said then that the accused took his hand away about six inches and came back again with a broken bottle, and again he demonstrated to you in a downward motion with the broken bottle, and that was the laceration to his cheek.

The accused said that Mr Tucker came to him with the bottle, he ducked under the bottle, it glanced off his shoulder, the accused said he grabbed the hand of Mr Tucker and the bottle at the same time, he was pushed back against the wall, he then pushed off the wall forward and stumbled. He doesn’t know how the bottle smashed, he said it may have smashed on the wall or it may have cracked on his head, but he did not see any injury and didn’t see any blood. It wasn’t until the next day he spoke to or text Mr Balchin that he became aware of the injury.

If you believe - it’s no secret, if you believed the accused version of the events and he doesn’t deliberately or recklessly wound Mr Tucker and you could not find him guilty. To find the accused guilty you have to reject his evidence, the evidence of accidental cutting. And who do you believe? 

Anything in the physical evidence which supports either of the two versions? As I said - first of all before I get to the physical evidence, there’s the evidence of Mr Webb. Mr Webb you will remember was standing in the kitchen and he indicates that he was just inside the door of the kitchen near the sink, and he said - I’m sorry, Mr Webb was the person who was the last witness.

Mr O’Dea was in the kitchen, he was about a metre away from the accused and Mr Tucker, standing just inside that doorway and he felt alcohol and glass shattering across his face. If you consider that evidence for a moment in light of the two versions given, one by the accused and one by Mr Tucker, if Mr O’Dea feels a spray of alcohol and glass you would think that there would be some force used in the breaking of bottle. He was a metre away and the glass in particular as well as the alcohol shatters over his face. And I think he also said that when he was in the ambulance or when he was in the hospital somebody still saw some glass shards on him.

That version, in my submission, supports Mr Tucker. Mr Tucker, you will recall, said that he was struck with force across the head and he said that he was in so much pain as a result of that blow that he thought he’d been scalped, something along those lines, and you would think there would be a fair amount of force used when struck on the head to break the bottle in the first place. It doesn’t support, that is Mr O’Dea’s version does not support the accused’s version of their being a struggle and the bottle either breaking on the wall or breaking on his accidentally.

Look at the photos and the glass fragments, in particular photos 23 and 24, there is glass debris almost in the middle of the room near the table and the chairs, that’s the approximate area where Mr Tucker said he was struck. It doesn’t support the accused’s version that he was struck or the bottle broke over near the wall, either against the wall or immediately when he was pushed off the wall, if that was the case you would expect the majority of the glass fragments to be over near the keg and the only bit of glass - not the only bit of glass but the most prominent piece of glass over there is the neck of the bottle.

Again, if you accept Mr Tucker or you are looking at Mr Tucker’s version of the events and he was struck in the middle of the room you would think it would be more likely that Mr O’Dea was sprayed with the alcohol and the glass shards. In my submission, it would be. If it was over where the accused said the event occurred then there was the wall in the way and you wouldn’t expect Mr O’Dea to be sprayed with the alcohol and the glass. (240-241)


	
	It was also explained how other circumstantial evidence supported Mr Tucker’s account. The jury was invited to accept his evidence and convict the applicant.
	
	
	The case then put for the applicant in response was that the jury should not speculate or guess as to what had happened, particularly in relation to glass on the floor of the kitchen. The jury was reminded that they had to be satisfied that the Crown had established its case beyond reasonable doubt and that:
	


“There is no room for error, no room for guessing or speculating. You can only decide in my submission the case on what you’ve heard in the witness box and what you saw, the demeanour of the witnesses, whether you choose to accept them or reject them.

Now in the defence case, Mr Abbott has told you that he was defending himself, he’s raised self-defence. Now he doesn’t have to prove that he was defending himself, it’s for the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he wasn’t defending himself, that he didn’t act reasonably. Now in considering whether he acted in self-defence you must consider what Mr Abbott thought at the time, what was in his mind. We know from the facts that he walked in on Mr Tucker who was snorting I think cocaine with his friends, and Mr Abbott told you and he told the police two days after the event that Mr Tucker had taken offence at that and told him to get out in no uncertain terms. Now you may think as a result of that Mr Tucker got irate, aggressive. You know that from his own mouth he said that he had at least 15 drinks plus cocaine, so when you look at that you may think from your experience outside this courtroom that someone who’s on drugs and alcohol may act irrationally, may act aggressively. It’s a matter for you. But as Mr Abbott has told you in the witness box, and you saw his demeanour, he answered the questions. He chose to be cross-examined and he didn’t have to do that either. Her Honour will explain the law to you.

I’m not going to bore you with a long address, I just want to get to the key points, and that is Mr Tucker was obviously affected by drugs and alcohol on his own admission. Mr Tucker on his admission and on Mr Abbott’s evidence that they were - he said playing, but Mr Abbott tells you he was hit in the ribs, he was in a headlock for about 30 seconds. He went into the kitchen and some time later Mr Tucker followed him. Now do you accept that or you don’t?”  (243-244)


	
	As to motive it was submitted for the applicant that:
	


“You may think that Mr Tucker had a motive in attacking the accused, the motive being he walked in on this drug taking. He took a dislike to him from that moment on, and things just got out of hand and when he walked into the kitchen, you may think that he did go to strike the accused and the accused defended himself as he says. I mean we don’t know exactly what happened and we probably never will because it happened so quick as Mr Abbott said. Things happened in a split second. Anything could have happened, but we know that George Tucker was injured and we also know from the evidence that Mr Abbott was not the aggressor. Mr Abbott said that he had six drinks.” (244)


	
	On appeal it was accepted that the submission in bold referred to a proposition which had been put to Mr Tucker in cross-examination.
	
	
	As to Mr Webb’s evidence it was submitted:
	


“The Crown is making a bit[sic] thing about Mr Webb’s evidence. Mr Webb said that this man was the most drunk person at the party, that’s what he said, but he also went to say if you recall that Mr Tucker wasn’t that drunk. Now he’s also been a friend of Mr Tucker’s for 25 years. All the people at that - who were in that vicinity are good friends of Mr Tucker’s and you may think well are they trying to cover up what their friend did or not? That’s another thing you’ve got to look at. Is it the case that they were being truthful about not seeing anything? A man who’s right next to him says he didn’t see anything. Mr Tucker told you that he was talking with several people when he was struck and yet nobody says that they saw the actual motion or the incident. 

When you look at all that, ladies and gentlemen, you would think to yourself well am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Abbott attacked this man for no reason according to Tucker, no reason at all? He just smashed the bottle over his head in a vicious and callous way. Well you people, as I said, come from all walks of life, you’re sensible people. You must look at the case carefully. All cases are serious. This case was a short case, it only went for about two days the evidence, but can I ask you to do one thing. You must be careful when you look at the evidence and you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. Now if you’re satisfied that Mr Abbott acted in self-defence, that’s the end of the matter. The first charge and the backup and the second charge, you must return verdicts of not guilty.

Now as I said earlier Mr Tucker - Mr Abbott chose to give evidence. He became a witness in the case. He didn’t have to do that but he chose to do that, he chose to give his version and his version that on that night he was minding his own business and he was being harassed by Mr Tucker, and that in the end Mr Tucker attacked him and he defended himself. When you’re sitting in judgment on your fellow human being, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to do this. Put yourself in his shoes. If one of your relatives or friends or yourselves was in the witness box you would want to be treated as fairly as possible and you would want to scrutinise the evidence. You wouldn’t want to guess at what happened or speculate. There’s no room for that in these cases. You must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecution has proven their case, the elements of the offence.” (244-245)


	
	On appeal it was accepted for the applicant that what was submitted above in bold had not been put in cross-examination to Mr Webb, but there was no objection and the trial judge did not refer to it in her summing-up.
	
	
	In her summing up Syme DCJ explained to the jury repeatedly that the onus lay on the Crown to prove the applicant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. That was also repeated in the written directions the jury received, where it was directed as to the evidence:
	


“5.    The jury should assess the various witnesses. Jury members are judges of facts, and should use their common sense to assess each witness’ evidence. The jury does not have to accept all that a witness says. It can accept or reject all or part of any witnesses’ evidence.

6.    The Accused gave evidence, although he was under no obligation to do so. He is a witness like all other witnesses. You must assess his evidence and decide if it is credible. At the same time you must bear in mind that he does not have to prove anything.”    


	
	Her Honour explained in her summing up how the evidence of the witnesses was to be assessed; that the jury was not obliged to accept the whole of a witness’ evidence and that if there was a logical reason for accepting only a part, the whole of the evidence did not have to be accepted. Her Honour also identified what was not in issue; what had to be resolved; and how the jury would go about that task.
	
	
	Directions were given as to self defence and the onus which lay on the Crown in that regard. Her Honour directed that:
	


“Your first task I would suggest to you is then to decide and you are the judges of the facts, is to decide as a question of fact whether the accused’s intoxication had anything or not anything to do with the events as he perceived them. If you do not find that the accused was under the influence of alcohol to the extent that it affected his judgment in that regard then simply follow the self-defence directions that I have given you.

If you do find that intoxication is a relevant consideration then when considering the subjective belief of the accused, you have to take into account his perception in determining whether, what he did was a reasonable response in the circumstances. That reasonable response if you do find he was intoxicated, might be affected by his perception or understanding as to the events earlier in the evening and his interaction earlier in the evening with Mr Tucker.

Again these are not legal issues, these are factual issues for you to consider.” (20-21)


	
	As to the conflict between the witnesses’ evidence, her Honour directed:
	


“In this case I would suggest to you that the version given by Mr Tucker and the version given by Mr Abbott do not sit together. Mr Abbott spoke of Mr Tucker approaching him in a way he did not consider to be in a friendly manner, earlier in the evening, particularly relating to Mr Abbott having walked in on Mr Tucker during the cocaine event.

Other witnesses gave their view of the behaviour of both of them earlier in the evening. Mr Webb talked about Mr Abbott being highly intoxicated and of Mr Tucker being less so. Mr Balchin saying they were both intoxicated and indulging in what he called physicality. Mr O’Dea confirmed that they were both drunk and Mr Tucker was in as he described it a happy mood but Steve he said, Mr Abbott, not enjoying it. I think he spoke about folded arms at one stage. Keep in mind the state of sobriety or otherwise of the witnesses who were giving evidence and I might suggest to you members of the jury you will have noticed that this is just another complicating feature, not a complicating legal feature but a complicating factual feature for you as judges of the facts to consider. You consider the state of sobriety of the witnesses when they were observing certain things, you consider whether people who have drunk that amount of alcohol are good observers. You consider a party with apparently, according to the evidence of some witnesses, around about 50 people, going over a number of hours and you consider the observations of those people, some of whom may or may not have been drinking a lot during the course of that evening, not all of whom spent all of their time with either Mr Abbott or Mr Tucker. These are all matters you take into account when considering the observation of the various witnesses.

It was suggested by Mr Crown that Mr Webb would be a better observer because he was not drinking, Mr Paneras suggested that might be the case but that Mr Webb might be biased in other ways because he was a good friend of Mr Tucker. Again all matters for you to take into account.” (22-23)


	
	Her Honour also gave a particular warning in relation to Mr Tucker’s evidence:
	


“Now as I have suggested to you the evidence of Mr Tucker is important. Wherever the Crown case seeks to establish the guilt of the accused person, Mr Abbott, with a case based entirely or largely as I suggest to you is the case here, on the evidence of a single witness and that witness is Mr Tucker, it is important that you the jury are given certain directions about that, that is what I am going to do now, I am going to tell you that you must exercise caution before you can convict the accused because of the fact that the Crown case largely depends on you accepting the reliability of the evidence of Mr Tucker. Unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tucker is both an honest and an accurate witness in relation to the account he has given you, then you cannot find the accused guilty. I would suggest to you that is because the nature of the evidence that you heard before you, Mr Tucker gave you evidence of a completely unprovoked attack out of the blue. It was a twofold attack. You will recall him standing up and giving evidence of the way things happened.

Before you can convict the accused you should examine the evidence of Mr Tucker very carefully in order to satisfy yourselves that you can safely act upon that evidence to the high standard required in a criminal trial. Now this caution is not based on any view that I have, I told you at the outset I would not give you my view on any particular piece of the evidence and I am certainly not doing that now. Both counsel have concentrated on the evidence of this witness for good reason, where the Crown case depends on the evidence largely, or the single witness, juries are always given a direction such as this. It is because the onus and standard of proof remains on the Crown. The onus is on the Crown to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt, the standard is beyond reasonable doubt. They rely heavily on Mr Tucker’s evidence.

I am not suggesting that you are not entitled to convict the accused upon the evidence of Mr Tucker. Clearly you are entitled to do so but only after you have examined his evidence and satisfied yourself it is reliable beyond reasonable doubt. In considering his evidence and whether it does satisfy you of the accused’s guilt, you of course look to see whether it is supported by any other evidence. Mr Crown suggested to you you would look at the way evidence was given, answers to questions in chief and answers to questions in cross-examination. He has also suggested that there is some evidence that supports Mr Tucker’s evidence, he has referred to the physical evidence of the glass shards on the floor. Mr Paneras addressed you on that issue as well and has told you that you should not take that as evidence, supporting Mr Tucker’s evidence and you should not speculate as to how those glass shards got there.” (23-24)


	
	Directions were also given as to the circumstantial evidence, including that the jury was not to speculate in relation to inferences and in relation to Mr O’Dea’s evidence.
	
	
	As to the applicant’s evidence her Honour directed:
	


“Now the accused’s evidence. The fact that the accused has given and/or called evidence does not alter the burden of proof of each of the elements of the offence. The accused does not have to prove that his version is true. The Crown has to satisfy you that the account given by the accused should not be accepted as a version of events that could reasonably be true. Now I am not going to repeat the evidence of Mr Abbott again but it is obvious to all of us here that the evidence of Mr Abbott is at odds with the evidence of Mr Tucker.

The accused also gave a version of the events in the recorded interview which you saw on DVD and by and large adopted that in his evidence in chief. The accused again is not required to prove that his account is true. The Crown in discharging its obligation to prove the accused’s guilt must satisfy you that the version given by the accused could not possibly be true.

So if the accused’s version in the DVD or his evidence in court leaves you with a reasonable doubt as to any element of the Crown’s case then you must acquit, because it follows obviously that the Crown will not have proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. So if what the accused said leaves you with a doubt as to any element of the Crown’s case then you must acquit. It is only if you reject the version given by the accused and on top of that you are satisfied as to the elements of the offence then you can convict the accused.” (26-27)


	
	Her Honour asked the parties whether there were any other matters which ought to be addressed. There were not.
	
	
	As the Crown accepted on appeal, the prosecutor’s address to the jury as to the various witnesses’ evidence ought not to have been advanced on the basis that the fact that the applicant had an interest in the outcome of the proceedings was relevant to assessing his credibility. It is that concession which in my view should lead to leave under Rule 4 being granted. That occurred when the Crown submitted:
	


“… is there a motive for the accused not to give you an accurate version of what occurred? You might think that his motive is that he is facing a serious criminal charge.”


	
	Whether a miscarriage of justice resulted, however, must be determined in the context of all that occurred at this trial.
	
	
	The Crown submitted at trial that Mr Webb had no motive to lie about how much alcohol the applicant had consumed and that if his evidence was accepted over that of the applicant, the jury might consider why the applicant was not telling the truth about that matter. The question posed was:
	


“Was he trying [to] colour his evidence to make his evidence more acceptable, more credible? Was he trying to discredit Mr Tucker? Who agrees he had a lot to drink and also ingested cocaine, as he tried to, by inference, suggest to you that his, that is the accused’s version, is more accurate than Mr Tucker”


	
	There was nothing objectionable in this submission. These were matters which the jury was entitled to consider in determining whether to prefer the evidence of Mr Webb, or that of the accused.
	
	
	It was further submitted by the Crown that if the applicant’s evidence as to how much alcohol he had consumed was rejected, the jury might consider that to be a basis on which it would reject his evidence outright, because:
	


“If he’s not telling you the truth in relation to how much he had to drink and you infer the reason for him not telling you will give an accurate estimate of how much he had to drink and what his state of intoxication was, was to discredit somebody else, in particular Mr Tucker then you might think that the whole of his evidence is just not worthy of being accepted by you … “


	
	This submission is not contrary to what was discussed in Hargraves and Robinson, or that discussed in MAJW v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 255, where it was observed at [40]:
	


“… As pointed out by Grove J in R v Booty NSWCCA (19 December 1994, unreported) the ""interest of an accused person in securing an acquittal is self evident"". However, references to it in the course of the trial should be avoided to the extent possible because such references may unfairly prejudice the position of the accused by suggesting that he or she is to be treated as ""a suspect witness"" and undermining the presumption of innocence in the manner pointed out in Robinson.”


	
	The submissions in relation to whether Mr Webb or the applicant should be believed on the question of how much alcohol the applicant had consumed did not rest on the applicant’s interest in securing an acquittal, or that he should be treated as a suspect witness, but rather on an analysis of how credit issues lying between him and Mr Webb might be resolved and what impact that might have on how the jury would resolve the credit issue lying between the applicant and Mr Tucker. They were matters which the parties were entitled to address and which the jury had to consider and resolve.
	
	
	Nor did these submissions undermine the standard of proof which fell on the Crown, or the presumption of innocence to which the applicant was entitled. In Palmer v R [1998] HCA 2; 193 CLR 1, the problem was cross-examination of the accused to show that he could not prove any ground for imputing a motive to lie to the complainant. The law does not require an accused to prove that a complainant has a motive for the making of false accusations and so it was concluded that the questions there asked of the accused invited speculation and diminished the onus of proof which fell on the Crown.
	
	
	This was a different case. Here the Crown’s submission that the jury might conclude that the applicant had sought to discredit Mr Tucker’s evidence, by lying about the level of his own intoxication, was a matter plainly open to the jury to consider in deciding whether to prefer the evidence of the applicant over that of Mr Webb and Mr Tucker, and a matter which the Crown was entitled to raise for its consideration.
	
	
	In Robinson, by way of contrast, what was in issue was a direction which included (see at 532):
	


“Another test was what interest does a witness have in the outcome of a case? If you thought a witness had a large interest in the outcome you, as the judges of the facts, might well conclude that you should scrutinise that witness's evidence closely. You might think - it is a matter solely for you - that the accused had the greatest interest of all the witnesses you saw and heard and that, therefore, you should scrutinise his evidence closely.”


	
	It was held at 535:
	


“If the jury accepted that suggestion, as they almost certainly would have, his Honour's directions had the effect that the evidence of the appellant had to be scrutinized more carefully than the evidence of any other witness, including the complainant, for no reason other than that he was the accused. The unfairness of such a direction is manifest, particularly when the outcome of the trial inevitably turned upon the jury's preference for the evidence of the complainant against that of the accused. Moreover, the directions virtually had the effect that the appellant was to be treated as a ""suspect witness"" in the same way as an accomplice, a complainant in a sexual case and a young child have been treated as ""suspect witnesses"", that is, as witnesses whose evidence is to be accepted only after the most careful scrutiny …

Nothing in the above is intended to suggest that the evidence of an accused person is not subject to the tests which are generally applicable to witnesses in a criminal trial. Thus, in examining the evidence of a witness in a criminal trial - including the evidence of the accused - the jury is entitled to consider whether some particular interest or purpose of the witness will be served or promoted in giving evidence in the proceedings. But to direct a jury that they should evaluate evidence on the basis of the interest of witnesses in the outcome of the case is to strike at the notion of a fair trial for an accused person. Except in the most exceptional case, such a direction inevitably disadvantages the evidence of the accused when it is in conflict with the evidence for the Crown.”


	
	In Hargraves it was observed at [45] - [46]:
	


“45    Robinson, too, is to be seen as a particular application of this more general principle. Inviting a jury to test the evidence given by an accused according to the interest that the accused has in the outcome of the trial, or suggesting that the accused's evidence should be scrutinised more carefully than the evidence of other witnesses, deflects the jury from recognising and applying the requisite onus and standard of proof. It is for the prosecution to prove its case, not for the accused to establish any contrary proposition. The instructions which a trial judge gives to a jury must not, whether by way of legal direction or judicial comment on the facts, deflect the jury from its fundamental task of deciding whether the prosecution has proved the elements of the charged offence beyond reasonable doubt.

46    The principle that is identified is expressed at a high level of abstraction: did the judge's instructions deflect the jury from its fundamental task of deciding whether the prosecution proved the elements of the charged offence beyond reasonable doubt? Directions given by a trial judge can often be assessed against that principle by observing no more than that the judge has so instructed the jury that it would be open to the jury to evaluate an accused's evidence on the basis of the accused's interest in the outcome of the trial. It is to be emphasised that trial judges must not instruct juries in that way: whether as a direction of law or as a judicial comment on the facts of the case. And it should also be emphasised that nothing that is said in these reasons should be understood as diminishing the need for intermediate courts of appeal to insist upon the observance of this requirement. Whether there has been on any other ground whatsoever a miscarriage of justice must always require consideration of the whole of the judge's charge to the jury. In every case, the ultimate question must be whether, taken as a whole, the judge's instructions to the jury deflected the jury from its proper task.”


	
	There it was concluded that the impugned direction was unlikely to have been given much prominence by the jury and would not have been understood as meaning that the appellants’ evidence had to be scrutinised more carefully than that of other witnesses and that “read as a whole, the instructions which the judge gave would not have deflected the jury from its task of deciding whether the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt” (see [49]. Accordingly there was no miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	This is a similar situation.
	
	
	Here it is the Crown’s address which is submitted to have given rise to a miscarriage. It was not, however, submitted for the Crown that the applicant’s evidence had to be scrutinised more carefully than that of other witnesses, but rather that the jury would consider whether the applicant had lied about his level of intoxication, in order to discredit the evidence of Mr Tucker. The brief reference to the applicant’s motive for lying being that he faced a serious criminal charge is unlikely to have been given prominence by the jury, given the other matters addressed by both parties as to the factual issues which they had to resolve and the directions which Syme DCJ gave the jury.
	
	
	What was submitted is unlikely to have been understood as meaning that the applicant’s evidence had to be scrutinised more carefully than that of other witnesses. The directions given by Syme DJC as to what had to be determined, how the evidence of the witnesses, including the applicant, was to be assessed, namely in a similar way, also diminished the likelihood that the submission as to the applicant’s motive would have been given the prominence found in Robinson.
	
	
	No objection was taken to the Crown’s submissions at trial, nor were particular directions sought in relation to the accused’s evidence, understandably given the written and oral directions which Syme DCJ gave. On appeal, it is the absence of an instruction that the Crown’s submissions on how the credit issues lying between the Crown witnesses and the accused should be resolved, namely by ignoring the Crown’s submissions, which were submitted to have given rise to a miscarriage.
	
	
	That submission may not be accepted. Given the credit issues on which this case turned, had such a direction been sought, it could plainly not have been given.
	
	
	Nor can it be accepted that the Crown’s submission that the conflict between Mr Webb’s evidence and that of the applicant might be resolved on the basis that the applicant was lying about his sobriety, because he wanted to discredit Mr Tucker’s evidence, was illogical, as the applicant also submitted on appeal.
	
	
	Nor can the argument that the Crown’s submission rested on “comparative motives to lie”, which amounted to consciousness of guilt reasoning accepted. In Zoneff v R it was observed at [15] – [17]:
	


“15    The meaning of the phrase ""consciousness of guilt"", the risk that its use by the trial judge may itself suggest guilt, which circumstances call for the giving of an Edwards-type direction, and the difficulty in distinguishing between lies going to credibility and those indicating guilt have been matters of some controversy. The Court of Appeal in Victoria in a series of cases, R v Morgan, R v Renzella, R v Laz, R v Erdei, R v Cervelli and R v Konstandopoulos has sought to grapple with the problems. But as Hayne JA in Morgan suggests, rigid prescriptive rules as to when and in what precise terms an Edwards-type direction should be given cannot be comprehensively stated.

16    There may be cases in which the risk of misunderstanding on the part of a jury as to the use to which they may put lies might be such that a judge should give an Edwards-type direction notwithstanding that the prosecutor has not put that a lie has been told out of consciousness of guilt. As a general rule, however, an Edwards-type direction should only be given if the prosecution contends that a lie is evidence of guilt, in the sense that it was told because, in the language of Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Edwards, ""the accused knew that the truth ... would implicate him in [the commission of] the offence"" and if, in fact, the lie in question is capable of bearing that character. (The words in italics are ours and, for the sake of clarity, should be included in the statement of principle.)

17   Moreover, if there is a risk of confusion or doubt as to the way in which the prosecution puts its case, the trial judge should inquire of the prosecution whether it contends that lies may constitute evidence of consciousness of guilt and, if so, he or she should require identification of the lie or lies in issue and the basis on which they are said to be capable of implicating the accused in the commission of the offence charged. [Citations omitted]”


	
	At trial, what was in issue was whether the applicant had cut Mr Tucker’s face deliberately, or recklessly, or accidentally. The difficulty with the evidence of both the applicant and Mr Tucker was that they were both intoxicated at the time of the offence, on the Crown’s case, each having consumed alcohol and cocaine.
	
	
	Mr Tucker had accepted in his evidence that he had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol. The applicant’s evidence was that he had not taken cocaine and that he had only had six drinks that night. This evidence conflicted with that given by Mr Webb and Mr Tucker and was challenged in cross-examination. The submission that the applicant had lied about what he had consumed, in order to enhance the credibility of his evidence, by way of comparison to that of Mr Tucker, did not amount to consciousness of guilt reasoning.
	
	
	As the Crown argued, that submission quoted at [33] above properly drew to the jury’s attention that they could not convict the applicant unless they had rejected his evidence as to how the cut had come to be inflicted and invited them to do so, by accepting that the applicant had lied about his consumption of alcohol, in order to enhance his credibility by comparison to that of Mr Tucker. That was not a “short cut” to conviction, as was submitted on appeal.
	
	
	There was, it follows, no miscarriage in posing the question “[a]nd who do you believe?” in the passage quote at [33] above. What was being put was properly, that if the jury believed the applicant’s account of the incident in which Mr Tucker was injured, he had to be acquitted.
	
	
	That was a question which the jury had to resolve, in accordance with the directions which Syme DJC gave.
	


Orders


	
	For these reasons, while it may be appropriate to refuse the leave sought under s 5, given the Crown’s concession on appeal I would order that leave be granted and the appeal dismissed.

Judgment


	
	The Plaintiff brings proceedings against the Defendant, Milos Supljeglav, alleging an accident, which occurred on 23 June 2010 at the house known as xx Alexandra Drive, Menora, Western Australia, in which it is claimed that she fell due to an unilluminated staircase, occasioning injury. The Defendant owned the premises and its rooms were rented out to students. The Plaintiff’s daughter Hayley Dwight [1]  had been a student at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts [2]  and was returning to Sydney after staying at the Defendant’s property.
	
	
	On the day before the accident the Plaintiff gave evidence that she and her husband, Dean Dwight [3]  had travelled from Sydney to Perth for the purpose of assisting her daughter with her departure back to Sydney on the Indian Pacific on 23 June 2010.
	


THE ACCIDENT


	
	The Plaintiff’s evidence was that on arrival in Perth she and her husband were picked up by Ms Dwight and taken to the Defendant’s house. The Plaintiff had stayed at that house overnight and stated that she had been up and down the stairs in the afternoon on the day of her arrival. She claimed that no functioning light was present in order to illuminate the stairs. She ascertained this as her daughter had told her that the lights were not working. She stated that when she went upstairs in the evening it was dark, there was minimal lighting although she thought that her daughter might have left the lounge room lighting on as she walked up the stairs.
	
	
	On the morning of the accident, the Plaintiff stated that she got up early between 5 -6am, had a shower and clothed, before taking a carry bag and proceeding to make her exit down the stairs. She claimed that she had turned on the light switch, which was outside the bathroom, but no light came on. In cross-examination, the Plaintiff conceded that she could not recall turning on the lights for the main stairwell in light of the advice given. She proceeded down the stairs in darkness with the bag in her right hand. As she got to the end of the banister she thought that she was at the end of the staircase. She stepped out and her foot was met by nothing but air. She let go of the bag and fell down onto the floor.
	
	
	The Plaintiff denied that the accident happened because she misjudged where to place her foot. [4]  When this was put to her she stated: -
	


“No, no, the light- if I could have turned the lights on and the lights were working, which they weren’t and I couldn’t turn the lights on, I wouldn’t have fallen.” [5] 


	
	The Plaintiff conceded that the stairs were not well lit [6]  but stated that she had to descend the stairs in order to get out of the house. [7] 
	
	
	Mr Dwight gave evidence that he awoke first, went out of the front door of the house, pulled the door and went outside. Although the front door was closed, it was not locked. He did not hear anything. He claimed that, when he came back into the house after going to his car, he pushed the door inwards and saw the Plaintiff on the floor in front of him and towards the left. At that time there was enough light for him to see her.
	


What Time did the Accident Occur?


	
	The Plaintiff denied that the accident happened during daylight hours between 8am and 11am, and denied that she was carrying a box down the stairs. She conceded that there was a frosted window through the front door and a streetlight across the road. When it was put to her that she was assisted in her vision by the presence of natural light she stated: -
	


“Well, I fell when it was dark. So what natural light there was, was very dark natural light. It wasn’t, light as if it were sunny…” [8] 


	
	Mr Dwight gave evidence in relation to the stairs was as follows: -
	


“There was no lights on the stairs that were working so Hayley had advised us, I don’t actually remember when, whether it was the day before or the night, exactly when, but they weren’t working. I never tried them because I was obviously under the impression of what I was told, so therefore I just went down. I held onto the banister and missed the last step, just stumbled. I didn’t fall or anything, it was fine.” [9] 


	
	Mr Dwight was adamant that the accident could not have occurred later in the morning than between 7 and 9am because he had to have his daughter’s car on the train between 7 and 7.30am.
	
	
	Mr Ben Kirkham [10]  was another tenant in the Defendant’s property. He gave evidence that he recalled the incident involving the Plaintiff. He stated that he heard a noise. At that point he was in his bedroom. He walked to the top of the stairs and asked the Plaintiff if she was okay by yelling down. He was asked whether he could see her at that point and he stated that he could not. He recalled that the incident occurred in the morning, perhaps between 8am and 11am, during daylight. It was put to him in cross-examination as to whether it could have been at 5.30am. He was adamant that it was later, because he was not awake at that time. He conceded, however, that his calculation of the time between 8 and 11am was made on the basis that he would have been asleep before then.
	
	
	The Plaintiff denied that she saw or spoke with Mr Kirkham in the house during her stay.
	
	
	Mr Dwight denied, to his knowledge, ever meeting Mr Kirkham and was definite that he did not appear at any stage when he and his wife were at the house between 22 to 23 June 2010.
	
	
	Ms Dwight gave evidence that Mr Kirkham returned to the house on 15 June 2010  [11] having left in the second week in February 2010 after having lost his job in Perth. The return date accords with his Mr Kirkham’s evidence although in Exhibit E at [12] Mr Kirkham stated that he left Perth around 11 March 2014. Ms Dwight stated however that she did not see Mr Kirkham whilst her parents were visiting her. To use her words: “Ben sort of flitted in and out. You never really knew where he was.”  [12] 
	
	
	Mr Kirkham stated that he had seen the Plaintiff at the premises during the week that they were there, about four days earlier. When it was put to him that Mr and Mrs Dwight had arrived the previous day, he did not disagree with that. He conceded that he could have been wrong, although in his assessment it was roughly four days. In cross-examination he conceded that it might not have been four days; it might have been less than 24 hours. Nevertheless he recalled seeing the Plaintiff, both in Ms Dwight’s bedroom, in the lounge room and downstairs. He thought this had occurred the day before the accident.
	
	
	Mr Kirkham asserted that the Plaintiff did not stay at the house in the period before the accident but rather had been staying elsewhere. [13]  He further gave evidence that he understood that the Plaintiff was carrying a box downstairs at the time of the accident. In evidence he stated that this understanding was derived from a conversation that he had had with the Plaintiff in which she told him that she was carrying a box. [14]  However, in his statement of 7 August 2013, [15]  he stated that he “came out to see what happened” and the Plaintiff “standing and picking up a box.” The Plaintiff denied carrying a box. [16]  Mr Dwight confirmed that the only item on the floor near where the Plaintiff fell was a red small carry bag. [17]  Ms Dwight did not see a box, just a red carry on suitcase. [18] 
	
	
	In the circumstances, while I am satisfied that Mr Kirkham had returned to the house at the time of the accident, I do not accept that his version of events as accurate. His evidence before me varied significantly not only with the Plaintiff’s case but also with statements given by him, which were Exhibits D and E in the proceedings. Specifically I do not accept that the accident occurred between 8am and 11am as Mr Kirkham stated. His evidence in this regard was based on when he claims he awoke. The evidence of the Plaintiff, Mr Dwight and Hayley Dwight was that they had a specific time slot to load Ms Dwight’s car onto the train before boarding that train. [19] 
	
	
	I am further satisfied that the accident occurred around 5.30am when there was minimal natural light. The evidence of Ms Dwight was such light coming through the frosted front door was insufficient to make out the stairs [20] . To use her words ‘it was pretty dark” [21]  and “pretty pitch black.” [22]  These observations were made after the accident when Ms Dwight awoke came down the stairs and the Plaintiff was already in the lounge room. [23]  Mr Kirkham conceded that at 5.30 in the morning there would not have been any light at the bottom of the stairs. [24] 
	


What were the Arrangements with the Landlord?


	
	Ms Dwight was attending the Academy from 2008 to 2010 to complete an Advanced Diploma in Performing Arts. At the end of 2009, she was able to arrange to take a room at the premises from a friend named Jess, as a tenant of the subject property.
	
	
	Ms Dwight gave evidence that she was told that she had to pay $100.00 per week into a bank account and was given the details by Mr Kirkham. She stated that she understood Ben Kirkham was the ‘go-to person’ “if you ever wanted to live in the house.” He had apparently lived there for as long as she knew and was given a piece of paper by him, which was Exhibit C in the proceedings. That paper identified the bank account details of the owner, his name and the sum of money to be deposited. Mr Torrington, who appeared on behalf of the Defendant, indicated that the slip came with deposit slips for the bank account. However, these were not tendered in the proceedings. The Plaintiff’s evidence was that she did not meet the Defendant landlord. The Defendant confirmed this.
	
	
	In February 2010, Ms Dwight formally moved into her room upstairs next door to her roommate ‘Jackie.’ Ms Dwight remained in the property until the day of the accident. A copy of the building layout can be found at Tab 19, P 252 – 3 of Exhibit ‘B’. The stairs leading from the bottom floor to a landing at the top can be seen in Tab 18, P 251 of Exhibit ‘B’. There were in fact two flights of stairs and after the landing on the left, there were another four steps to the hallway, then a right turn and at the end of the house was Ms Dwight’s bedroom. [25]  Ms Dwight stated that there were three sets of lights near the stairs: -
	



	
	At the bottom near the long flight of stairs;
	
	
	At the top of the long flight of stairs above the platform;
	
	
	A light outside the bathrooms on the top floor.
	
	
	These are marked in Tab 19, Exhibit ‘B’
	


Were the Lights Working ?


	
	Ms Dwight stated that when she arrived in February, the downstairs light in the area just inside of the front door, which is at the bottom of the long flight of stairs, was not working. The light in the landing-platform at the top of the long flight of stairs was working. However, she stated that she would turn on the light near the bathroom and that it would provide some illumination in the immediate vicinity. She further stated that the lights at the bottom of the stairs were not operating, so it was dark when you got to the bottom, unless there was a roommate that turned on another light. The other light was the kitchen light, which shone through the door just to the entrance. [26] 
	
	
	Coming down the long stairs on the left side, there was a banister, which stopped three steps before the ground level. In that area, Ms Dwight stated that the area was pretty dark and there were no functioning light illuminating it. She stated that to try to assist herself in descent from time to time she would hold on to the wall instead of the banister, so she would walk down with her right hand along the wall and curve around because she was always going into the kitchen or lounge room. She stated that if she was going down at night she would use her mobile phone, turn it on and it would shine it like a light, but it was not a torch. [27] 
	
	
	Ms Dwight stated that she recalled telling Mr Kirkham when coming home from a performance on an earlier occasion that it was very dark when opening the door and he said, “Yes, the light doesn’t work”. Ms Dwight replied “Well that’s annoying because it’s really dark when we come home at night.” Ms Dwight stated that she understood that Mr Kirkham knew about it, but he did not seem fussed. She stated, “He wasn’t worried. He just said, ‘Yeah, it will get fixed one day,’ or he just wasn’t worried. He sort of ignored my comment.” [28]  Ms Dwight also stated that she probably also told Mr Kirkham in passing about getting the lobby light fixed in February. [29] 
	
	
	Ms Dwight gave evidence that on 22 March 2010 there was a storm following which the three aforementioned lights were claimed to be not working. Ms Dwight stated: -
	


“On the day and night of the storm, there was water dripping from the one at the top of the long flight of stairs, the light had water damage around it and it was sort of dripping water. “Like my room floor was all wet and sort of upstairs was all a little bit damp.” [30] 


	
	Ms Dwight claimed that she took photographs of the room and sent them to her mother. She stated that the photos depicted her room where she had pulled blankets off and had towels on the ground. She did not take photos of the window because her roommate Jackie had already cleaned it up.
	
	
	The photos were not produced to the court, it being unclear if they were still available. [31]  Ms Dwight said that she had lost contact with her roommate Jackie and did not know her whereabouts. [32] 
	
	
	Ms Dwight stated that two days after, she had come home with her friend Jackie, walked upstairs and noticed a “strange man” near the bathroom. Ms Dwight replied, “Hello” and asked what the stranger was doing in the house. He replied that he was just fixing the windows. Ms Dwight claimed that the man had a foreign accent, grey hair, workman clothes and a tee shirt. She said, ““Is it possible to fix the light at the top of the flight of stairs? It’s dripping water” and then said, “The one above as well”, a comment which I interpreted as referring to the light outside the bathroom. She stated that she could not remember what the man said but that he did mumble and sort of nod his head. Ms Dwight stated that she did not mention the light at the bottom of the stairs but did mention, “Our lights were not working.” [33] 
	
	
	The incident involving the repair to the window was challenged in cross-examination but Ms Dwight was sure the storm broke the window. Ms Dwight’s gave evidence that her diary entry from 22 March states, a storm and no power. [34] 
	
	
	Ms Dwight stated that she rang Mr Kirkham afterwards because she assumed he would know who the man was having previously lived there. [35]  She recounted her conversation, stating that she asked Mr Kirkham “who is the strange man who looks sort of like this” to which Ben Kirkham replied, “it was the owner’s father and he comes around to fix the house.” Hayley then said “okay. Also, the lights are still out. Do you reckon he would fix them or did I need to call someone to fix them?” Mr Kirkham is said to have responded that he would look after it. [36] 
	
	
	Ms Dwight was asked questions at TP 68. 15 as follows-
	


Q. When you rang Ben – what, was he in Sydney when you rang him?

A. Yes. I assumed he was in Sydney because that’s where I last heard he was, so yes, I rang Ben as if he was in Sydney.

Q. When Ben came back on the 15th and a few days before the accident occurred, did you see anything happen in relation to the lights at this stage?

A. No, nothing.

Q. Do you believe that the lights were not functioning as at the date your mother fell?

A. Yes. They were not working.

Q. By, “the lights” you mean the three lights that we referred –

A. The three lights, yeah; all of them in the roof, the ones around the stairs.

Q. Could you reach the lights to change the light bulb yourself?

A. No. They were really tall. The roof was really high. I would have definitely needed a ladder.


	
	Mr Torrington for the Defendant at TP 78. 9 questioned Ms Dwight as follows: -
	


Q. You said on a number of occasions the lights weren’t working. Can I suggest to you, when you did make a complaint to Ben, there was action done to get the lights working?

A. I can’t guarantee there was, no, as I didn’t hear back from Ben that anything like, there was an electrician coming.

Q. And was it the case that you didn’t, so to speak, test the lights to find out one way the other, you made complaints to Ben. Is that a fair statement?

A. I did test the ones upstairs.

Q. But not the lower two lights.

A. No

HIS HONOUR: Sorry, the lower two?

TORRINGTON.

Q. Well, how many – the lower one?

A. The one, yeah, just the one.

HIS HONOUR: Sorry, I’m confused. Can you say that again?

I tested the ones upstairs, because they were near my light switch, like it was all in my – close - --

Q. When did you test those?

A. - -

Q. When did you do that?

A. I would test them probably once every two weeks, just flick them on and flick them off, but nothing happened.

TORRINGTON

Q. See, what I want to suggest to you is that contrary to that the lights when the complaint was made were fixed up. Do you agree?

A. I don’t understand, sorry.

Q. You’re saying the lights weren’t repaired, or when the complaint was made, they weren’t repaired. I’m suggesting that if you made a complaint, they were in fact repaired.

A. No, not that I know of, no.

HIS HONOUR: Sorry, when are we talking about Mr Torrington?

TORRINGTON: At the time of the complaint.

Q. At any time you made the complaint, action was taken?

A. No, nothing. I would complain and then two days later, try and flick them on and they wouldn’t come on.

Q. So the last time you tested these lights was about a week before, and that was only the upstairs one?

A. Only the upstairs one.

Q. And I think the evidence was that the lower, the downstairs one, a month before. Is that correct?

A. Yes. I was told by Ben that the downstairs never worked and none of us – I don’t think anyone ever tried. It was just known that it didn’t work.

Q. So did you in fact ever try it?

A. Yeah, I did.


	
	In his evidence Ben Kirkham stated that he lived at the subject premises for some time. [37]  The Defendant asserted that it had been a period of eight years. [38]  As noted at [14] of these reasons Mr Kirkham returned to the property on 15 June 2010 and he was previously absent from it at least since 11 March 2010.
	
	
	In chief, Mr Kirkham was asked if there were any lights near the stairs and the foyer area. He said, “ Yeah there’s one right at the front and there is one switch for it. There was another light at the landing at the top and there were two switches for it, one at the bottom of the stairs and one outside the bathroom upstairs.” He stated that there was another light near the bathroom and there was one light, which was outside the bathroom. [39]  He stated that in respect of the lights outside the bathroom, the landing and downstairs, he had previously changed the lights. [40] 
	
	
	Then when asked whether he was able to be specific as to which one was or was not working, he replied, “No”. When asked if one had not been working what would have occurred: -
	


“Changing the light globe” [41] 

He stated that if he were there he would have done it. [42] 


	
	In cross-examination, Mr Kirkham conceded that he had made a statement to NRMA dated 10 April 2014, which was tendered as Exhibit E in the proceedings. In that statement Mr Kirkham said: -
	


“10. I also continued to reside at the property located at xx Alexandra Drive, Menora

11. At the time of the storm on 22 March 2010, I was temporarily residing between NSW and Victoria for about 3 months and only heard about it on the news.

12. I had left Perth around 11 March 2010 and returned mid June 2010.

13. I am not aware of what damage, if any, was sustained to the house as a result of the storm.

14. With regard to the lobby light not working since Hayley Dwight moved in, this is correct due to me not having bothered to change the globe. As far as I am aware this fitting still works.

15. I don’t recall if Hayley ever complained to me about the lobby light not working.

16. I am not aware of water having dripped from the lights above the stairs or outside the bathroom.

17. Similarly, I do not recall Hayley ever complaining to me about there being no light on the stairs, however, there were occasions when this light had been blown and as it difficult to replace there have been times when the light has not been replaced for a period.”


	
	In chief Mr Kirkham stated that in respect of minor repairs such as light globes the position was “Personal change. So by myself or others of the house.” [43]  In cross-examination he conceded that it was his job to change the light bulb himself. [44]  He further conceded that it was quite possible that on the morning of the accident the lobby light was not working but stated that the light at the landing may also not have been working. [45] 
	
	
	He further conceded that there was a light outside the bathroom up another set of stairs and along a hallway. He stated that, that light was where there was not a complete closed wall over the stairwell and the light could go over but he has no recollection as to how far that light goes. [46] 
	
	
	It was not put to Mr Kirkham that the light outside the bathroom was not working on the day of the accident. However, in re-examination he stated that the “three lights would never be out at the same time because he couldn’t live without a bit of light in the house.” [47] 
	
	
	I accept the Plaintiff’s evidence to the effect that she attempted to activate the light outside the bathroom however it was not working at the time of the accident. Ms Dwight also gave evidence that she attempted to activate the two upstairs light switches probably every two weeks but nothing happened. [48]  She stated that the last time she tested the upstairs lights was a week before the accident. [49] 
	
	
	On the evidence, I am also satisfied that the downstairs lobby light was not working at the time of the Plaintiff’s accident. This is acknowledged by Mr Kirkham in his statement to the insurer [50]  Ms Dwight stated that she last tested the lobby light a month before the accident. [51]  Mr Kirkham returned to the premises the week before the accident and there is no evidence that he or anyone else changed any bulbs at any time following the storm.
	
	
	So far as the landing light is concerned, the evidence of Ms Dwight was that there was a storm on 22 March 2010, and the water was dripping from the top of the long flight of stairs and the light had water damage around it. Ms Dwight’s evidence as to previous complaints to Mr Kirkham about that light is referred to in [24] of these reasons.
	
	
	In considering this evidence and the phone call with Mr Kirkham described earlier in these reasons it is not at all clear as to what his response meant. At the time, Mr Kirkham had left Perth and there was so far as I am aware no immediate prospect of his returning to the house. Ms Dwight’s request was a fairly broad one, which could have encompassed her taking action to call someone to fix the lights. Mr Kirkham’s response could be interpreted as him taking the responsibility to get someone to fix the lights. Indeed this appears to have been the Plaintiff’s assumption [52] 
	
	
	The Plaintiff gave evidence that Ms Dwight had told her that a storm had occurred on the 22 March 2010 in Perth and that this was common knowledge and broadcasted on the news. She stated that her daughter, Hayley, had advised her that the bathroom window had been broken and that the bedroom had flooded because of water leaking through the roof. [53] 
	
	
	Mr Kirkham gave evidence that he did not recall Hayley ever complaining about there being no lights on the stairs but he conceded that he was not saying that she did not complain, just that he could not specifically recall. [54]  He acknowledged, that on the day of the accident, the light on the lobby and the light on the stairs were quite possibly not working. [55]  It was not put to him as to whether he contacted the Defendant to inform him of what occurred and to get someone to come and fix the lights.
	
	
	Mr Kirkham nevertheless did concede that from news reports and contact from friends he was aware of a big storm that had knocked out a lot of electricity out in Perth. He was not aware however that it had knocked out the power at the Defendant’s property. [56] 
	
	
	The Defendant’s evidence was that, as far as he was aware, as at June 2010 the lights were operational and he received no complaints about the light globes not working or that the lights were out at around June 2010. [57]  When asked what he would have done if informed, he stated: -
	


“I would have certainly arranged my father to go have a look to ascertain whether he could attend to it, if not we would have arranged for my brother, who is an electrician, to attend to what ever was required and if he was not able to then obviously a tradesperson or a relevantly qualified person.”  [58] 


	
	The following emerged during cross-examination of the Defendant: -
	



	
	He did not specifically recall a large storm on 22 March 2010;
	
	
	The Defendant stated that he did not recall damage to the bathroom window;
	
	
	He did not recall any repairs being done to the house in March 2010;
	
	
	He would pay for any repairs and he had no knowledge that any were done to the property;
	
	
	If the bathroom window needed repairing, it would be his father who would ascertain what was required and he would get a professional person to do it;
	
	
	The reason his father would go was that he was retired and was more easily available;
	
	
	The Defendant’s father could not generally change light bulbs as this was something that the tenants would generally do;
	
	
	He accepted that, generally speaking, the maintenance issues of the tenants amongst other things would come to him from Ben Kirkham primarily but not always;
	
	
	He accepted that if a tenant did not know his number or had a problem with something, they would go to Mr Kirkham; and
	
	
	The Defendant acknowledged that he went to the property from time to time for inspections.
	



	
	The Defendant stated that he had never met Mrs Dwight (presumably meant to refer to Ms Hayley Dwight) and as far as he knew, he thought she had to speak to Mr Kirkham. [59] 
	
	
	Ms Dwight was a reasonably impressive witness and I accept her evidence. I found Mr Kirkham confusing and unreliable in his recollection as to what had occurred. I accept Ms Dwight’s account as to the occurrence of the storm and its impact as described above. I further accept based on her evidence that she saw the Defendant’s father at the premises shortly after the storm and raised with him changing the light at the top of the flight of stairs. The Defendant’s father was not called to give evidence even though the Defendant said he was available. [60]  I am also satisfied that Ms Dwight raised the issue with Mr Kirkham as described in her evidence and that no action was taken to replace the lights by the time of the Plaintiff’s accident. I am supported in this finding by the evidence as to the difficulty in changing the lights, Mr Kirkham’s absence from the property between the time of the storm and a week before the accident, his concessions as to periods when the light bulbs remained unchanged, the Defendant’s account of lack of any knowledge and Ms Dwight’s evidence described above.
	
	
	In all, I am satisfied that the three lights over the landing, outside the bathroom and in the lobby were not operational at the time of the accident and had been so at least since 22 March 2010. The lobby light was probably not operational since the time Ms Dwight moved in February 2010.
	


DUTY OF CARE


	
	The Plaintiff submits that the common law duty of care owed by a landlord requires the court to follow the general principles in relation to duty of care set out in s 5B Civil Liability Act 2002 (WA) informed by statutory provisions referred to later in these reasons.
	
	
	In Department of Housing and Works v Smith (no.2) [61]  Pullin JA with Newnes JA concurring held that it was unnecessary to decide whether the Civil Liability Act 2002 (WA) or the Occupiers Liability Act 1985 (WA) reflect, supplant or modify the common law. Pullin JA stated: -
	


“[11] The High Court in Adeels did not expressly consider the question whether in New South Wales the common law relating to duty of care, standard of care or causation continued to apply or whether the relevant Civil Liability Act provisions modified the common law or entirely supplanted the common law. However, the impression I gain from the reasons is that the High Court regarded the relevant provisions of the New South Wales Act as supplanting the common law.

[12] The trial judge’s view that s 5B in the CLA is “exclusionary” might be understood to mean that the common law continues to operate in Western Australia in relation to duty of care and standard of care (and causation), and that once common law principles determine liability then s 5B of the CLA is applied and if the factors referred to in s 5B(1) and (2) are met the person will then be “not liable”. If, on the other hand, s 5B supplants the common law, then it will mean that the courts cannot make incremental changes to the law to meet new circumstances. Instead, only Parliament will be able to make changes.

[13] No submissions were made by the parties about the trial judge’s opinion and for the reason given below I will not express any concluded views about the subject. …….”


	
	Buss JA differed in his response stating at [71]-[74]: -
	


“[71] In Sheehan v State Rail Authority [2009] NSWCA 261, Beazley JA (Giles JA agreeing) observed that the New South Wales Act does not define when a duty of care is owed at [55]. Her Honour then said:

[55] … That determination remains subject to the common law. Section 5B deals with breach.

[72] Similarly, in Roads and Traffic Authority (NSW) v Refrigerated Roadways Pty Ltd (2009) 53 MVR 502; 168 LGERA 357 ; [2009] NSWCA 263, Campbell JA (McColl JA agreeing and Sackville AJA agreeing generally) examined and applied s 5B of the New South Wales Act in the context of the legal test for breach of duty, and not in the context of whether a duty of care existed at [172]–[177]. This approach was also adopted by McColl JA (Ipp JA agreeing) in Stojan (No 9) Pty Ltd v Kenway [2009] NSWCA 364 at [89]–[90], [118]–[119], [125]–[140].

[73] In Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak (2009) 239 CLR 420 ; 260 ALR 628 ; [2009] HCA 48 (Adeels), the High Court held, relevantly, that the appellant, who carried on a reception and restaurant business at premises that were licensed under the Liquor Act 1982 (NSW), owed each of the respondents, who were patrons of the business, a duty to take reasonable care to prevent injury to them from the violent, quarrelsome or disorderly conduct of other persons on the premises.

[74] The joint reasons of French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ do not give the impression that s 5B of the New South Wales Act has modified or supplanted the common law principles for determining whether a duty of care exists or not. This is readily apparent from the following. First, their Honours said that although ss 5B (and 5C) of the New South Wales Act appears beneath the heading “Duty of care”, that heading is apt to mislead: at [13]. Second, their Honours said that both of those provisions are evidently directed to questions of breach of duty: at [13]. Third, their Honours said that ss 5B, 5C, 5D and 5E are central to questions of breach of duty and causation: at [15]. Fourth, their Honours addressed the question of whether a duty of care was owed, in the case before them, solely by reference to the common law and the Liquor Act…”


	
	The leading authority on the duty of care owed by a landlord is Jones v Bartlett. [62]  In that case, Gummow and Hayne JJ said at [171]:-
	


“[171]........Broadly, the content of the landlord's duty to the tenant will be conterminous with a requirement that the premises be reasonably fit for the purposes for which they are let, namely habitation as a domestic residence.


	
	Further, at [173]-[174] their Honours stated:-
	


“[173] Premises will not be reasonably fit for the purposes for which they are let where the ordinary use of the premises for that purpose would, as a matter of reasonable foreseeability, cause injury. The duty requires a landlord not to let premises that suffer defects which the landlord knows or ought to know make the premises unsafe for the use to which they are to be put. The duty with respect to dangerous defects will be discharged if the landlord takes reasonable steps to ascertain the existence of any such defects and, once the landlord knows of any, if the landlord takes reasonable steps to remove them or to make the premises safe. This does not amount to a proposition that the ordinary use of the premises for the purpose for which they are let must not cause injury; it is that the landlord has acted in a manner reasonably to remove the risks.

[174] What constitutes the taking of reasonable steps will, as Dawson J noted in Northern Sandblasting, depend on all the circumstances of the case. What is reasonable for premises let for the purpose of residential housing may be less demanding than for premises let for such purposes as the running of a school, or the conduct of a hotel or club serving liquor. Moreover, the reasonableness of steps to be taken will be affected by the terms of the lease, including the level at which the rental is pitched,114 the obligations the parties allocated inter se and any specification of limited purposes to which the premises be put. It will also be affected by the terms of any applicable statutes, such as residential tenancy statutes. In some jurisdictions, there may be statutory requirements which supplant any common law duty or which impose a higher duty than the common law.”


	
	The Defendant has not contended that the Plaintiff was not owed a duty of care in the circumstances. The precise content of that duty was not the subject of submissions.
	
	
	I accept that the duty of care that exists in relation to a landlord remains that established by common law principles as set out in Jones v Bartlett as cited at [55] above. In my view s 5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (WA) deals with breach. Nevertheless regard should be had to ss 5 and 9 of the Occupier’s Liability Act 1985 (WA), which read as follows:-
	


“5. Duty of care of occupier

(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) the care which an occupier of premises is required by reason of the occupation or control of the premises to show towards a person entering on the premises in respect of dangers which are due to the state of the premises or to anything done or omitted to be done on the premises and for which the occupier is by law responsible shall, except in so far as he is entitled to and does extend, restrict, modify or exclude by agreement or otherwise, his obligations towards that person, be such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that that person will not suffer injury or damage by reason of any such danger.

…

(4) Without restricting the generality of subsection (1), in determining whether an occupier of premises has discharged his duty of care, consideration shall be given to —

(a) the gravity and likelihood of the probable injury;

(b) the circumstances of the entry onto the premises;

(c) the nature of the premises;

(d) the knowledge which the occupier of premises has or ought to have of the likelihood of persons or property being on the premises;

(e) the age of the person entering the premises;

(f) the ability of the person entering the premises to appreciate the danger; and

(g) the burden on the occupier of eliminating the danger or protecting the person entering the premises from the danger as compared to the risk of the danger to the person.

9. Duty of care of landlord

(1) Where premises are occupied or used by virtue of a tenancy under which the landlord is responsible for the maintenance or repair of the premises, it shall be the duty of the landlord to show towards any persons who may from time to time be on the premises the same care in respect of dangers arising from any failure on his part in carrying out his responsibilities of maintenance and repair of the premises as is required under this Act to be shown by an occupier of premises towards persons entering on those premises.

(2) ……….

(3) Nothing in this section shall relieve a landlord of any duty which he is under apart from this section.

(4) This section applies to tenancies created before the commencement of this Act as well as to tenancies created after its commencement.”


	
	Regard should also be had to the provisions of s 42 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1987 (WA) which impose a duty on any landlord pursuant to a lease (written or otherwise) in the following terms:-
	


“42. Lessor’s responsibility for cleanliness and repairs

(1) In this section —

premises includes fixtures and chattels provided with the premises, but does not include —

(a) any fixture or chattel disclosed by the lessor as not functioning before the agreement was entered into; or

(b) any other fixture or chattel that the tenant could not reasonably have expected to be functioning at the time the agreement was entered into.

(2) It is a term of every residential tenancy agreement that the lessor —

(a) …………; and

(b) must maintain the premises in a reasonable state of repair having regard to its age and character and must conduct any repairs within a reasonable period after the need for the repair arises; and

(c) ………….”


	
	In the present case, the tenants on the Defendant’s property effectively rented rooms and tenants had joint use of the remainder of the house with “other roommates.” The rent paid for the use of the room by Ms Dwight was $100.00 per week. This was not a case where a tenant had sole exclusive possession of the property. The tenancies involved casual, periodic use by a changing population of students (and their visitors), some such as Ms Dwight coming from interstate. It seems reasonable in the circumstances that the Defendant would have anticipated that tenants might bring in visitors to the property who might not have as much familiarity with the property and its condition. The arrangements were also such that the Defendant carried out maintenance duties using his father; including fixing leaking taps, lawn mowing and otherwise ascertaining what needed to be done. It was acknowledged that the Defendant did from time to time inspect the premises as described in [73] below.
	
	
	Two sets of light bulbs were difficult to replace; in particular, that the light affixed to the ceiling above the landing was some 3.1 metres from the floor and, from the bottom of the stairway, was 2.9 metres from the floor.
	
	
	In the circumstances I am satisfied that the use of the staircase by Ms Dwight and her parents was authorised and necessary in order to traverse the house and to make their exit on the occasion in question. I am also satisfied, bearing in mind the statutory provisions and cases referred to, the Defendant did have a duty to take reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to the Plaintiff. In my view the landlord’s duty bears closer analogy with an occupier of common property in a strata plan than one where the property is leased granting a tenant exclusive occupancy.
	


BREACH OF DUTY


	
	S 5B(1) of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (WA), requires three considerations:-
	



	
	the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known); and
	
	
	the risk was not insignificant; and
	
	
	in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person’s position would have taken those precautions.
	


Breach-The Risk Was Foreseeable


	
	It is clear that the Defendant did know that there would be difficulty in walking down the subject stairs in the dark. When he was asked that, if the railing were not there, then there would be a risk that a person descending the stairs could lose their balance as they would have nothing to hold on to that would prevent them from falling, the Defendant responded by stating “well, there is a wall on the side of the stairs.” Subsequently, the following question was put to him at TP 123.50-124.3:-
	


“Q. If you are in the dark, you are coming down the stairs and using the railing to provide security, there is no way that you can hold on to a corner of a wall, I suggest to you.

Well, if you can’t see the wall, then no.”


	
	At P194 of Exhibit B, being the report prepared by Chong Ngai Chew on behalf of Westralian Technical Consultants Pty Limited, dated 4 March 2014, it is stated as follows:-
	


“(115)…The night-time illuminance measurements I performed at the bottom of the subject staircase with the three abovementioned lamps switched-off, yielded a zero lux reading. In my opinion, zero lux illuminance would not have provided a lighting condition which was conducive to the safe movement of people on the subject staircase.”

…

(120) The handrail on the subject staircase does not extend over the two bottom steps. Omission of the hand rail over those two steps would place a person descending those two steps at risk of falling down in the event he/she starts to fall on either of those two steps, for example, due to slipping on a step or misjudging a step.”


	
	In my view the risk was foreseeable in the circumstances.
	


Breach-The Risk Was Not Insignificant


	
	The risk posed combination of the banister not covering the full length of the stairs and an unilluminated staircase was one which should have been obvious to a reasonable occupier in the position of the Defendant. In Laresu Pty Limited v Clark [63]  Macfarlane JA (with whom Tobias JA and Handley AJA agreed) stated:-
	


“[48] ……. As stated by Heydon JA (as he then was) in Wilkinson v Law Courts Ltd [2001] NSWCA 196 “[s]tairs are inherently, but obviously, dangerous” (at [32]). Where, as here, the stairs are internal ones that are not lit at times that it should be expected that persons may use them (see [21] – [22] above), the risk of someone missing a step in the dark and falling must in my view be regarded as a “not insignificant” one. The danger resulting from the absence of lighting of steps was recognised by this Court in Penrith Rugby League Club Ltd trading as Cardiff Panthers v Elliot [2009] NSWCA 247 (see [25]) and Stojan (No 9) Pty Ltd v Kenway [2009] NSWCA 364 (see [129], [133]).

[49] Whilst the danger of falling on the steps was one that should have been obvious to someone, such as Mr Clark, returning from the toilet when the relevant area was unlit, it was a danger with which Mr Clark had only limited means of dealing, that is, by shuffling across the landing in the manner he did or perhaps by following the wall around with his hands. Further Mr Clark ’s evidence did not suggest that when he ascended the stairs, having then enough light to locate the handrail at the bottom of the flight of stairs, he appreciated, or should reasonably have appreciated, the extent of the difficulty he would have in seeing the handrail at the top of the flight of stairs when he entered the landing from the corridor door on his return. This is especially so given that he had apparently not previously visited the bathroom when the area was unlit (see [6] above).

[50] The danger presented by the unlit stairs was one that should have been obvious to a reasonable occupier in the position of the Owner. The fact that the danger of the unlit stairs would have been obvious to persons returning from the toilet did not in my view absolve the Owner from taking precautions because users of the unlit stairs could not, for the reasons just given, reasonably avoid the danger facing them (see Francis v Lewis [2003] NSWCA 152 at [53] – [54]).”


	
	The fact that Ms Dwight had ascended the stairs with some illumination on the previous evening would not have given her an appreciation of the difficulties of descending the stairs without any illumination on the morning in question. In my view, there was not an insignificant risk that a person, in Ms Dwight’s position, even being careful, might miss a step and fall as she did.
	


Breach- In the Circumstances, would a Reasonable Person in the Person’s Position have taken those Precautions


	
	In this respect, I am required by s 5B(2) of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (WA) to consider a number of factors. In doing so, I take account of the fact that there was no evidence of previous cases of harm if care were not taken (although I do note that Mr Dwight himself stumbled as he came down the stairs earlier in the morning in question). This may be a product of the fact bedrooms of the tenants that were upstairs and visitors might be less likely to use the stairs in darkness. However the evidence also was that the lobby light had been not operational since Ms Dwight arrived in February 2010 and the light over the landing had been not operational since 22 March 2010. In my view the probability of harm occurring was elevated in such circumstances. Moreover, there was a real prospect that if an accident did occur as a result of someone descending and missing a step, then the person would fall down a number of steps with the substantial risk of serious injury (s 5B(2(b)). The burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk (s 5B(2)(c)) was not great. The Defendant’s system of inspection did not include checking light bulbs itself but rather relying on advice form Mr Kirkham who was relevantly absent as described earlier. [64]  Even accepting that the lights were placed at a significant height, if this did require engaging professional assistance, it could not be regarded as a significant cost.
	


Social Utility


	
	Finally, s 5B(2)(d) requires consideration of the social utility of the activity which creates the risk of harm. In this respect, Macfarlan JA stated in Laresu Pty Limited v Clark at [58]:-
	


“[58] Section 5B(2)(d) requires consideration of the “social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm” (see [40] above). The only possible social utility of not lighting the stairs would be the saving of the electricity required to power a light. Whilst economy in the use of electricity is to be encouraged, any saving of this nature is not of significance in the present context, involving, as it did, the risk of serious injury ……...”


	
	I accept that a reasonable person in the position of the Defendant was required to have a system of inspection and maintenance, which included the changing of light bulbs in common areas. Even bearing in mind the views of Buss JA in Department of Housing and Works v Smith No 2 at [87] to which the Defendant has drawn my attention, I am not dissuaded in this view.
	


Delegation of Duty


	
	The Plaintiff contends that the Defendant did not check the home to see if everything was being done in terms of maintenance, including that light bulbs were being changed. [65]  The Defendant’s evidence was that he did not have any written agreement with the tenants and that any contact that he had was generally went through Ben Kirkham. [66]  At TP 120.39-121.45 this exchange takes place.
	


“Q. He [Mr Kirkham]was the person through whom tenants maintenance issues, amongst other things, would be conveyed to you?

A. Not always, but primarily so, yes.

Q. And so if a tenant who didn’t know your number, may have your bank account details, but didn’t know your telephone number or something and had a problem then they would go to Ben Kirkham?

A. Yes.

Q. So you didn’t go and inspect the property to check the light bulbs were free, did you?

A. What period are we talking about?

Q. 2010.

A. Did I go to the property in 2010 to inspect light bulbs?

Q. Yes.

A. No.

Q. And so you would rely on somebody else to make sure that one of the maintenance issues that there were lights around so people could see n the common area, you would rely on somebody else, would you?

A. Generally, but of course I went to the property on occasions. So you know I obviously had the ability to see whether the light was on or not, but generally, yes.

Q. You understood that you had a duty to provide a premises that was reasonably safe. You understood that, didn’t you?

A. Yes.

Q. And that may need from time to time either you or somebody else having an inspection>

A. Yes.

Q. You understood that?

A. Yes.

Q. So that if a lot of light bulbs are out that you would discover that and do something about it?

A. Again, I’m not sure that light globes are entirely my problem.

Q. You hadn’t had an agreement with anybody in a written agreement. Is that correct?

A. No that, but there certainly is an arrangement in place.

Q. Okay, what was the arrangement? Whose province was it for the changing of the light bulbs if they were defective?

A. The tenants.

Q. Did you convey that to the tenants?

A. Well, certainly, initially, yes, because when first leased out the property there were rental agreements in place, and then subsequent to that Mr Kirkham, from memory, has been in occupation of the property for about eight years and over that time he has generally been the one to convey to other tenants that he is the one responsible, to ensure that anything is reported to me so that I can action whatever is required.”


	
	It appears that in practice, responsibility in relation to changing light bulbs rested with the tenants although the Defendant conceded that he went to the property on occasions and had the ability to see whether the light was on or not. [67]  However, he stated that he did not go to the property in 2010 to inspect light bulbs. [68]  This responsibility appeared to be accepted by Mr Kirkham and was further implicit in Ms Dwight’s request to Mr Kirkham in the phone call referred to in her evidence.
	
	
	The Plaintiff in his submissions drew attention to the fact that the Defendant had effectively delegated his duties in relation to the light bulbs to Mr Kirkham. At [27]-[29] of the Plaintiff’s submissions, the case was put as follows:-
	


“(27) In the current case, the landlord has not notified the tenant and has not put in place any effective system for the maintenance of the house. In particular, the Defendant was of the view that the changing of light bulbs was a matter for the tenants, albeit that it was accepted that the lights in the hallway, at the bottom of the stairs and in the landing required ladders to change the light bulbs.

(28) The only person who would change the lights accepts that the lights were out for some time because it was difficult to change and the relevant light (lobby light) was not working because he had not bothered to change the globe (see Exhibit E at [14]). There is no evidence to suggest that any arrangement was in place regarding the changing of light bulbs that were difficult to change.

(29) The landlord did not have a system in place from mid-February 2010 to mid-June 2010 because Mr Kirkham was not a tenant at the premises and indeed he was not in the state. There was no one in place for the changing of the light bulbs.”


	
	Effectively, the Plaintiff’s submission was that Mr Kirkham was the agent of the landlord. [69]  The Defendant on the other hand contended that Mr Kirkham was not the Defendant’s agent but rather the ‘go to man’ in the sense that, if there were a complaint, someone would tell him and he would go to the owner. [70]  In evidence, the Defendant stated that if he received some information from Mr Kirkham, he would generally ring his father within an hour or two of receiving the notification. After that his father would ascertain the situation and make a decision as to what was required. Specifically the Defendant contended that Mr Kirkham had no authority to bind the Defendant. On this basis the suggestion that Mr Kirkham was the agent of the Defendant was resisted.
	
	
	Mr Kirkham acknowledged that his role at the premises was as contended by the Defendant stating, “If there was something wrong with the house, they would come to me and then I would contact the landlord.” [71]  If the repairs were minor in nature, such as changing light globes, he stated he would personally change them by himself or others at the house would do so.
	
	
	When asked if there were a repair perhaps greater than a light globe or something that he did not do himself what would he do in respect of a repair if there were a complaint. Mr Kirkham stated that he would contact the landlord and that his father would normally come out to fix it. His experience in respect of repairs taking place after he had made a complaint was prompt.  [72] 
	
	
	In Bevillesta Pty Limited v Liberty International Insurance Co (2009) NSWCA 16, Hodgson JA (with the concurrence of Giles AJA and Nicholas J) stated at [53] as follows:-
	


“[53] There is no doubt also that this occupier’s duty of care is “delegable”, in the sense that it May be discharged in whole or in part by the occupier’s exercise of reasonable skill and care in engaging someone else to take steps to keep the property safe either generally or in particular respects. Discharge of the duty in this way requires reasonable skill and care in the selection of the other person, in arranging the terms of engagement of that person, and in confirming that the person does take appropriate steps. If it is reasonable for an occupier to seek to discharge or partly discharge the occupier’s duty in this way, and the occupier does exercise reasonable skill and care in all these respects, then if a person coming on to the property is injured due to the failure of the other person engaged to exercise reasonable skill and care to keep the property safe, the occupier May escape liability.”


	
	In the circumstances of the present case, I do not accept that the Defendant discharged his duty by using Mr Kirkham to change the light s or act as the so-called ‘go-to man.’
	
	
	Consistent with the decision in Bevillesta Pty Limited v Liberty International Insurance Co, there is no evidence that reasonable skill and care was exercised in the selection of Mr Kirkham for the purposes of any delegation of duty. Nor were there any terms of engagement or confirmation that Mr Kirkham was taking the appropriate steps. In particular it appears that there were no alternative arrangements made during his absence from the subject property which on his account was between 11 March 2010 and 15 June 1010. The evidentiary onus of establishing the reasonableness of any delegation rested with the Defendant. [73]  In my view it has not been discharged. The Defendant, at paragraph 52 of his written submissions, stated as follows:-
	


“The Defendant gave evidence that he was unaware of the suggestion that any inadequacy of the lighting or any complaints in respect of the premises. This accords with Mr Kirkham’s evidence that he was the ‘go-to man.’ Accordingly, no negligence can be brought home to the Defendant. On this basis of his knowledge, or on the basis of any failure in respect of a system, nor in respect of the state of the premises at the time.”


	
	For reasons previously mentioned, this submission is rejected.
	


OBVIOUS RISK


	
	The Defendant next contends that, in the alternative, the risk of injury was obvious and even if the Plaintiff was not aware she is presumed to be aware and therefore presumed to undertake that activity without the need for warning and undertook the activity voluntarily. [74]  The Defendant’s submissions go to the duty of the Defendant to warn in the circumstances. [75] 
	
	
	The Plaintiff resists this submission citing Carey v Lake Macquarie City Council, [76]  In that case McClelland CJ at CL stated:
	


[65] There are obvious difficulties in describing a risk as obvious when the level of risk may vary depending on the time of day or the person who must confront it. During the day, a bollard in a pathway would be obvious to any sighted person who was keeping an appropriate lookout. However, a bollard in a pathway at night is unlikely to present an obvious risk except to someone, who, from having seen it during the daylight, is conscious of its presence. Accordingly, a risk will be obvious when it is capable of being readily appreciated at the time that a person comes upon it.


	
	I accept that the risk presented by the shortness of the banister and the length of the staircase would not have been obvious to someone in the Plaintiff’s position in the circumstances that she attempted to traverse the staircase. Apart from this however I do not accept that an obvious risk arises in the circumstances such as to absolve the Defendant as the Plaintiff could not have avoided the danger in the circumstances. [77] 
	


CAUSATION


	
	The Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff failed to establish causation on the basis that she failed to turn the light switch on. Had she done so, the accident would not have occurred.
	
	
	Bearing in mind my finding at [51] of these reasons, this submission is rejected. In my view but for the Defendant’s failure to have in place a proper system of inspection and maintenance for lights the Plaintiff’s injury would not have occurred.
	


CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE


	
	The Defendant contends that by reason of the Plaintiff’s failure to turn the lights on there ought to be a finding that this was the sole cause of the accident and consequently a finding of contributory negligence assessed at 100%. In light of my finding at [51] of these reasons, the notion of contributory negligence pursuant to s 5K of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (WA) cannot be sustained.
	


DAMAGES


	
	Following the accident, the Plaintiff decided to proceed back to Sydney on the train from Perth. An icepack was applied to her ankle and she was able to elevate the leg although she stated that she was in pain.
	
	
	The Plaintiff stated that on her return to Sydney she went to Wyong hospital and had her leg placed in a back slab. As there was no orthopaedic surgeon on duty, the Plaintiff then went to Manly Hospital emergency department on 29 June 2010. X-rays were ordered which did not reveal any fracture. The ankle was, however, swollen and the Plaintiff was noted as having difficulty weight bearing. The resident medical officer diagnosed a moderate-severe ankle sprain with likely calf muscle tear. Also noted was a possible Achilles tendon injury. The ankle was strapped and the Plaintiff was advised not to weight bear. She was given crutches and was told to take regular analgesia. An appointment was arranged for an ultra sound scan and the Plaintiff was advised to make arrangements for private physiotherapy.
	
	
	On 30 June 2010, the ultra sound was taken which revealed an Achilles Tendon Rupture at the musculotendinous junction. Orthopaedic surgeons at Manly Hospital, reviewed her, placed her in a plaster cast, and surgery was scheduled for 1 July 2010. On this latter date, Dr Walter carried out the repair. It was noted that the following day the Plaintiff was mobilising independently on crutches at discharge. She was prescribed paracetamol and Oxychodone.
	
	
	The Plaintiff next saw Dr Roberts (fellow to Dr Walter) on 15 July 2010. Dr Roberts noted that the Plaintiff was doing well, the pain had settled and the wounds were healing. He arranged for the Plaintiff to be placed in a below-the-knee cast with her ankle in plantar flexion. He advised Mrs Dwight to remain non-weight bearing for a further one month.
	
	
	On 11 August 2010, Dr Walter saw the Plaintiff and removed the cast. He noted that the Achilles tendon appeared to be well healed and as was the wound. He indicated that the Plaintiff would be mobilised by partial weight bearing with a heel raise and further that she could start physiotherapy.
	
	
	On 7 September 2010, Dr Walter saw the Plaintiff again and noted that the wound had broken down, that the foot and ankle were very swollen and the wound had an opening of about one centimetre with discharge of puss and showing the Necrotic tendon underneath. He debrided the wound and took a wound swab. Dr Walter started the Plaintiff on Keflex and asked her to attend hospital for dressing to the wound.
	
	
	On 21 September 2010, Dr Walter noted that the wound appeared to be slowly healing. He advised persevering with the current treatment. However, on 7 October 2010, Dr Chris Fougere (fellow to Dr Walter) noted that the wound was not going anywhere and discussed debridement and vacuum dressing. The Plaintiff was admitted for this purpose on 15 October 2010 and was discharged from Manly Hospital on the 19 October 2010. Dr Fougere noted that the Plaintiff had made a good recovery post-operation and was discharged home with Vac therapy and prophylactic antibiotics.
	
	
	The Plaintiff started physiotherapy at Narabeen Sports and Physiotherapy Clinic on 15 November 2010. It appears she received some relief from soft-tissue massage and treatment. In addition, she continued home rehabilitation to maintain flexibility and strength around her ankle and foot stop.
	
	
	On 6 January 2011, the Plaintiff was seen by a general practitioner, Dr Singh-Panwar. Dr Singh-Panwar noted a concern by the Plaintiff’s physiotherapist that her leg was not responding to the treatment and was still swollen. He referred the Plaintiff for a Doppler and ultrasound of the right Achilles tendon on 6 January 2011 with Dr Geier. The Doppler suspected a DVT in one of the Plaintiff’s veins. Although the Plaintiff was referred to see Dr Walter for orthopaedic follow-up, it appears the Plaintiff did not see him. [78] 
	
	
	On 30 May 2011, the Plaintiff was seen by Dr Roberts for the performance of an MRI which noted:-
	


“Widespread subcutaneous oedema and a mottled appearance to the bone marrow? Reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Anterior-Talofibular ligament appearing intact superiorly but absent inferiorly suggest a partial ankle injury joint effusion but no loose body. Chronic Achilles Tendinosis.”


	
	On 8 June 2011, Dr Sue Reid referred the Plaintiff to see Dr Peter Lam for a second opinion. That referral is to be found in Exhibit B at Tab 9. The report of Dr Lam was not in the tendered material, however, Dr Endrey-Walder noted in his report dated 25 June 2013, [79]  that Dr Lam’s report acknowledged that “the scar is very sensitive especially within the area along the prominent scar where there is significant loss of subcutaneous fat” and that “swelling is not an uncommon sequelae following an infection after an Achilles tendon repair.” Dr Lam apparently recommended desensitisation and low-impact exercises.
	
	
	A further MRI report was obtained from Dr Roberts on 24 February 2014 which noted:-
	


“Persistent Achilles tendonopathy. Decreased marrow oedema and subcutaneous oedema. Partial deficiency of the anterior talofibular ligament and peroneus brevis tear.”


	
	The Plaintiff saw Dr Endrey-Walder at the request of her solicitors on 25 June 2013 and 8 October 2014. [80]  In his report of the 25 June 2013, Dr Endrey-Walder lists the Plaintiff’s complaints relating to her right ankle, including the ankle being stiff, a dull aching pain, tightness, permanent divot along the scar, swelling, an inability to walk long distances, having to hold on while walking down stairs, inability to squat fully or run. The second report of 8 October 2014 notes an analogous list of complaints. She apparently wears slide-in shoes with no back on them. So far as her daily living activities are concerned, the Plaintiff’s evidence was that she relied on her husband significantly in the period following the accident. This was not only for the purpose of transporting her to various appointments but for carrying out household duties which, previously, she would have performed. In order to carry out these duties, it appeared that Mr Dwight made arrangements through his employer to work from home. The Plaintiff’s estimate was that her husband was doing twenty hours per week of household duties, including driving. In December 2010, she said that she possibly went onto one crutch and eight months following the accident (March 2011) she had come off both crutches and had started to drive. [81] 
	
	
	The Plaintiff was challenged in relation to the amount of time that her husband assisted her during the eight-month period following the accident. [82]  In particular the Plaintiff was challenged on her estimate of her husband providing domestic assistance of four to six hours and it was put to her that this was a “guess as to how much time was actually needed.”  [83]  Mrs Dwight conceded that six hours would be a guess but she stated that he was doing at least four hours added up over a day. Mr Dean Dwight, the Plaintiff’s husband, gave evidence that during the eight or nine-month period following the accident, the Plaintiff was “out of action.” He confirmed that he did many of the household tasks, including driving Mrs Dwight to medical appointments.
	
	
	On the evidence I am satisfied that, for a period of eight months following the accident, the Plaintiff did depend on her husband and, to a lesser extent, her daughter Hayley for domestic assistance for an average of twenty hours per week. Thereafter it appears the Plaintiff was able to take up many of the household tasks and indeed returning to driving, increased activity cooking meals, some washing, vacuuming, shopping and cleaning. She conceded that by the time the eight months had passed, she was able to return to a lot of the activities for which she had previously relied upon her husband. [84]  This increased further by July 2012 although the Plaintiff maintained she still couldn’t do heavier tasks such as lifting heavy loads of washing, making and lifting beds, heavy grocery shopping and climbing ladders. [85] 
	
	
	Dr Endrey-Walder, in his report of 25 June 2013, [86]  noted that during the period of eight months when the Plaintiff was on crutches she would have needed at least two to three hours of help and assistance per day, seven days per week. Dr Noll who examined the Plaintiff on behalf of the Defendant did not specifically comment on past assistance.
	
	
	In my opinion the Defendant’s submission that the Court would not be satisfied that there is sufficient basis to make any allowance under s 12 Civil Liability Act (2002) (WA) cannot be accepted. The amounts proposed by the Plaintiff for hourly rates have not been disputed by the defendant and appear to me to be within the calculations provided for in s12(7) Civil Liability Act (2002) (WA). Doing the best I can on the evidence, I propose to allow twenty hours per week for a period of 32 weeks at $25 per hour, being an amount of $16,000. Thereafter I propose for a period of four years to allow for an average of four hours per week at a rate of $25 per hour being an amount of $20,800. The total amount for past gratuitous assistance is $36,800.
	
	
	So far as the future is concerned, Dr Noll, who saw the Plaintiff for the Defendant on 16 January 2014, referred to the fact that the Plaintiff managed most of her normal activities of daily living including her share of household chores. He noted that the Plaintiff’s husband maintained the outdoor area including doing her share of the household tasks. I have also noted the comments of Dr Endrey-Walder in his report dated 8 October 2014 [87]  where he stated:-
	


“There is little doubt of a relative incapacity in relation to various household related chores, especially those which require her to perform cleaning low down, squat or crouch, activity which she would normally be able to cope while stepping up on a chair or ladder.

She certainly has no capacity to perform yard work, heavier duty household maintenance and repair. I have previously recommended one hour of help per day, seven days per week in this regard, and I would confirm that opinion following today’s assessment.”


	
	My own assessment, however, based on the evidence referred to is that the Plaintiff’s has been able to progressively increase the activities which she was able to perform and indeed has returned to a lot of the activities that she had previously relied upon her husband. On balance, it appears to me to be reasonable allow one hour per week for the future at $30 per week as claimed being an amount on a multiplier of 860.8 of $25,824 for the future.
	


Out of Pocket Expenses


	
	So far as out of pocket expenses are concerned, the parties have agreed arithmetically on a total of $6,368.55 for the past. I am satisfied that it is reasonable to award this sum to the Plaintiff.
	
	
	Further, in respect of future out of pocket expenses, the Plaintiff claims 24 physiotherapy treatments per year, three visits to a general practitioner per year and one visit to an orthopaedic specialist per year. An additional amount of $5,000.00 is sought as a possible requirement of a peri operative anti-coagulation, on the basis of the opinion expressed by Dr Endrey-Walder. [88] 
	
	
	On the basis of the out of pocket expenses schedule provided by the Plaintiff, it appears that the Plaintiff last saw a doctor in 2011, although she did have an MRI on 24 February 2014. Dr Noll stated in his report [89]  that there was no indication for any further investigations or any further specific treatment and that the Plaintiff was unlikely to benefit from any further passive treatment such as physiotherapy. His view is that it is possible that she could benefit from further self-directed stretching and strengthening exercises, which do not require any further instructions from a physiotherapist.
	
	
	In my view, the Plaintiff has had extensive investigations and treatment from medical practitioners. Dr Endrey-Walder noted in his report of 25 June 2013 [90]  that the Plaintiff saw Dr Artinian following obtaining a second opinion from Dr Lam on 14 June 2011, where Dr Artinian said “but there is nothing much he can do.” Dr Endrey-Walder further noted that the Plaintiff’s physiotherapy treatment had been reduced to one session per month. He noted that the Plaintiff should be encouraged to continue with physiotherapy and her current casual work as a swimming instructor, as hydrotherapy would probably be even more helpful in maintaining her current level of functionality than physiotherapy would be. In his report of 8 October 2014, [91]  Dr Endrey-Walder states that the Plaintiff should continue to rely on physical therapy on a regular basis to at least maintain her current level of functionality of the ankle.
	
	
	The Plaintiff’s evidence was that she continued to have physiotherapy approximately once per month, although she possibly should have gone every fortnight, however, her physiotherapy allowance from her medical fund was limited. [92]  She indicated that the purpose of the physiotherapy was to get massage and relieve some of the pressure inside the joint. She also does exercises at home. [93] 
	
	
	In the circumstances, I propose to allow 12 physiotherapy treatments per year at $80.00, multiplied by 860.8, being an amount of $15,892.00. I will allow a further buffer of $2000.00 on account of over the counter pain medication, which the Plaintiff gave some evidence of. In my view the Plaintiff’s condition has reached a plateau and I am not persuaded on the evidence that any further medical treatment or therapy is reasonable or will be required.
	


Non-Economic Loss


	
	The Plaintiff is aged 55. The injury suffered by her was a significant one. It was sustained in circumstances where it was difficult for her to obtain immediate treatment but ultimately resulted in surgery, infection, immobilisation and an extended period of physiotherapy. Her home and work lives were disrupted as indicated in these reasons. In addition the Plaintiff gave evidence of previously enjoying recreational pursuits such as walking, running and bike riding. [94]  Whilst her condition has in my view stabilised she gave evidence of still suffering from swelling, cramps and pain in respect of which she obtains relief by physiotherapy, Panadol and Voltaren. Nevertheless she has returned to many of her household tasks including driving although the evidence is that she needs assistance with heavier tasks. In all of the circumstances I propose to allow $100,000.00 for non-economic loss in accordance with s9 of the Civil Liability Act (2002) (WA).
	


Economic Loss


	
	The Plaintiff was employed from approximately 2009 with Terry Hills Golf Club, earning $40,000.00 gross per annum managing the golf club. She was made redundant after two years just prior to the accident. At the time of the accident, she had not found a job although she claims that she was looking for one. The evidence that she gave was that following the accident that she applied and obtained three interviews. [95]  In cross-examination, the Plaintiff stated that two of the jobs were at the Royal Golf Course in the city in an administrative role, sitting down, and the other was at the East Lakes Golf Course of a similar vein. [96]  She stated that she applied for these positions in the first eight months of her injury and had crutches at the time. Her evidence was that she felt mentally that she could do the jobs but physically she did not know. She stated at that at the time of applying she felt that she could do the job, the problem was getting to the job because she could not drive. [97]  The third interview, which the Plaintiff attended, was with IBM and was an administration position. The Plaintiff’s husband had apparently suggested this position however she was unsuccessful.
	
	
	In July 2012, the Plaintiff obtained qualifications teaching children how to swim and was working at Mosman Ezyswim. Her evidence was that she worked Wednesday afternoons, Thursday and three hours on a Saturday as a fill-in. She gave evidence that on average she worked four hours a week and claimed that she would not work long hours as she gets cramps in her legs. She did not work on holidays because of the demands. She confirmed her earnings were $21.00 per hour. The Plaintiff’s evidence was that following eight months of the injury, in July 2012 when she commenced at Ezyswim, she could carry out an administrative type role, depending upon where it was. At the time when she commenced at Ezyswim in July 2012, her evidence was that she was capable of full-time administrative assistant duties. [98] 
	
	
	Dr Endrey-Walder, in his report dated 8 October 2014, [99]  stated:-
	


“I would consider her fit to perform some part-time clerical/administrative work if she were lucky enough to obtain a position, and if so, one would recommend a maximum of four hours, five days per week. Alas, she has not been lucky so far.”


	
	Dr Noll, however, in his report dated 16 January 2014, [100]  stated:-
	


“In my opinion, Mrs Dwight would be capable to resume office-based work activities if she chose to do so. It is noted that she currently works as a swimming teacher and, in my opinion, she would be able to continue with this work activity for the foreseeable future. Given the nature of her work activities, it is unlikely that the injuries sustained would result in any impairment of her future earning capacity.”


	
	The Plaintiff seeks the sum of $650.00 for the past less earnings from Ezyswim said to be $105.00 per week (from July 2012). The Defendant claims that there is no basis to conclude that at the time of the accident the Plaintiff would have been immediately able to obtain employment and accordingly, the Plaintiff’s past economic loss should comprise a small buffer to compensate for the period from the time of the accident to February 2011, or from the time of the accident to July 2012. I found this aspect of the claim most difficult.
	
	
	On her evidence the Plaintiff, has had education to secondary level. Her chronology Exhibit A states that she has a Diploma in Information Technology and has completed a real estate course. Whilst Exhibit A refers to her having been employed doing administrative work after her marriage on 6 February 1982 and before her daughter’s birth on 31 May 1990 there are no details of this. The only pre injury job that the Plaintiff gave evidence of was for a period of two years at the Terry Hills Golf Club. After she ceased that job in June 2010, she had not found another job at the time of the accident. Since the accident, she also has had no other position apart from that at Ezyswim. She did give evidence however of having attending three interviews referred to earlier. When she was asked whether she enjoys her current job, she stated, “It’s alright.” [101]  She stated that she was still applying for positions.
	
	
	The Plaintiff’s main concern about resuming working was driving. Her evidence was she recommenced driving after eight months. Bearing in mind the circumstances of adjustment so as to being able resume driving to work after eight months I have allowed an extra 3 weeks making a total of 35 weeks from the time of the accident to February 2011 at $650.00 net, less 10% to take into account the fact that the Plaintiff may not have been employed in any event. This equates to an amount of $20,475.00. Loss of superannuation has been claimed although not included in the loss schedule. In the circumstances I will allow 11% for past superannuation loss being an amount of $2252.25. For the four-year period from 20 February 2010 to date, I consider the Plaintiff could have worked in an administrative role, such as the role, which she had previously performed, based on her own evidence. I am not persuaded that she has sought employment as actively as she could in that time. Despite her concession I am not persuaded even if she did work, that she would be able to maintain any such employment uninterrupted for the balance of her working life. In my view any such disruption is likely to have been relatively more pronounced in the past than in the future particularly before July 2012 when she commenced at Ezyswim. In all, I consider that a buffer should be awarded of $20,000 for the past four years and $40,000 for the future. This would account for any time that she may have (or have had) off and time during which she may also have (or have had) occasional difficulty driving to work for a short period. I have taken account of loss of superannuation in these amounts.

2424185,R v Kelsall (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 253,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused, Daniel Jack Kelsall, has pleaded not guilty to the two counts on the indictment which allege that on 8 September 2013 at Neutral Bay he indecently assaulted and murdered Morgan Huxley.
	
	
	The Crown case is that after the accused had finished work as a kitchen hand late at night he followed the deceased from the Oaks Hotel at Neutral Bay to the deceased's nearby home in Watson Street. It is alleged that he entered the deceased's apartment and there, in the deceased's bedroom, committed the two offences. The deceased's flat mate was alerted to sounds coming from his bedroom. She went to investigate and found the deceased on the floor covered in blood. The immediate investigation established that he had died from the effects of multiple stab wounds.
	
	
	The issue with which this judgment is concerned is the admissibility of statements made by the accused to two people in the middle of 2012. It is common ground that the statements amount to ""protected confidences"": Ch 3 Pt 3.10 Div 1A of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). A court is empowered to exclude such evidence by s 126B, and must do so if satisfied of the matters in s 126B(3). For the purposes of the section, the court is required to take into account the matters listed in s 126B(4).
	


The protected confidences


	
	The statements are set out in exhibit A on the voir dire and they were identified within that exhibit at the places indicated by the Crown Prosecutor (2.3.15 at T4.25 - 4.35).
	
	
	The first statement (to Dr Susan Allman, general practitioner, on or about 15 May 2012) is to the following effect:
	


The accused said he had intrusive thoughts about killing people with a knife on the way home at night. He said there was no real reason for this and he had not thought about the consequences. He took a knife home late one night but he did not meet anyone.


	
	The second statement (to Dr Matthew Boulton, psychiatrist, on 6 June 2012) is to the following effect:
	


The accused said he had thought of killing someone for the thrill of it. He had no idea why. The victim would be ""a total random"" and it would be done with a knife. At the same time he said that he did not want to kill anyone; ""absolutely not"". This was when the depression he was experiencing was at its worst. That situation has improved since he has been on antidepressant medication.

Other Evidence


	
	Dr Allman was asked on the voir dire whether the accused had said anything about when he was experiencing the thoughts he had spoken about and she replied:
	


""He said that it was when he was coming home from his job as a chef late at night, and that he took his chef's knife home with him and that he had been thinking about the idea of using it to kill somebody, but that he hadn't met anyone on that particular night."" (2.3.15 at T7.35.)


	
	Dr Allman said that she informed the accused that what he told her would be confidential except if there was a risk of harm to him or to others (T7.45). She agreed in cross-examination that the accused had not said when he had experienced these thoughts (T10.4).
	
	
	Dr Allman was also asked for her opinion as to whether divulging what the accused had told her in this case might have any adverse bearing on the willingness of others to confide their thoughts with medical practitioners. She said:
	


""I don't think so because I always make it clear that confidentiality is limited if there was suicidality or if there was danger to other members of the community. And that is the exception to confidentiality."" (T11.46) (See also her answer at T13.22.)


	
	Dr Boulton was asked a similar question. He referred to patients discussing ""a lot of very personal and troubling thoughts, thoughts that are often actually quite common in the general population, but never amount to anything"". He said that ""some of these issues are embarrassing or some … are very personal"". He was concerned about the possible affect upon clients and potential clients if there were to be any breach of confidentiality in relation to matters of that type (T23.20).
	
	
	However, Dr Boulton's practice, as part of a standard procedure, sent to the accused some information and forms prior to his first consultation. One was headed ""Privacy and Billing Consent Form"" and it was signed by the accused with an indication (a tick in a box) that he had read and understood the form. It included:
	


""We do not pass your personal information on to others without your consent, except under the following circumstances:

●   If we are concerned about your safety or the safety of others, including children with whom you have contact, we are required by law to do whatever is necessary to ensure the safety of all concerned. This may involve breaking confidentiality as necessary to protect you or other people involved. …

●   Sometimes files are subpoenaed by a court of law in which case we are legally obliged to hand over your file notes to the court. The subpoena of files only occurs where the clinical interaction is related to legal proceedings such as claims for compensation, hostile custody disputes, criminal activity, and so on. …""


	
	Evidence was also given by Dr Abdul Saad, psychologist. Dr Boulton had referred the accused to Dr Saad in June 2012 and thereafter they engaged in a number of psychological counselling sessions, the last being in September 2013. Dr Saad's statement (in Exhibit A) recorded that there ""was no evidence of thoughts of self-harm, attempts to commit self-harm or of homicidal ideations or plans"". He also said that his assessment of the accused's ""risk status, to both [him]self and others, remained low throughout his entire engagement with myself"". He said that the accused had not spoken to him about having an intrusive thought of killing a stranger with a knife, or of taking a knife home with him one night (T27.27).
	


Consideration


	
	The first matter to be determined is whether the evidence is relevant: Evidence Act, s 55.
	
	
	The primary fact in issue is whether the accused was the person who stabbed Morgan Huxley to death. I have earlier briefly outlined the factual basis of the Crown's case that he was. The defence case is anticipated to be that the accused went to the deceased's home; he was permitted to enter; he engaged in consensual sexual activity before the deceased fell asleep; and he then left. Some unknown person subsequently killed the deceased.
	
	
	In the light of these competing cases, evidence that the accused had spoken of having a thought, or thoughts, of doing precisely what the Crown alleges he did could, in my view, rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of that primary fact in issue.
	
	
	The matters listed in s 126B(4) that are required to be taken into account do not all point in the same direction.
	
	
	The probative value (s 126B(4)(a)) of the evidence has to be assessed in context. Aside from the evidence of protected confidences, the Crown case relies upon the following:
	


1.   The accused's DNA was found on the deceased's penis.

2.   The accused's fingerprint was found on the deceased's bedroom door.

3.   CCTV footage establishes that the accused lingered around the vicinity of the Oaks Hotel for about 30 minutes (after having briefly encountered the deceased in a nearby convenience store) and then followed the deceased as he walked away from the hotel. For a time he was jogging, or running, after the deceased.

4.   The accused gave some answers in an interview with police on 24 September 2013 that might be considered incapable of belief.

5.   The deceased's blood was found on the accused's satchel bag.


	
	Items 1 and 2 are neutral, given the nature of the anticipated defence case. Items 3 and 4 raise suspicion. Item 5 could be strongly probative of guilt, but the defence response to this item of evidence remains unknown; in other words, it is possible there will be an explanation advanced that could be regarded as credible.
	
	
	In this context I consider the probative value of the protected confidence evidence to be high. The jury could well accept that it would be nothing short of remarkable that Mr Huxley could be killed by someone else when the accused had spoken the previous year of doing precisely what the Crown alleges. This is particularly so when a significant part of what he spoke of in the past, and what he now accepts occurred, coincides: ""he was coming home from his job as a chef late at night"" and the killing was carried out by stabbing with a knife.
	
	
	The evidence is important in the proceedings because of its potentially high probative value: s 126B(4)(b).
	
	
	Nothing more needs to be said about the matters in s 126B(4)(c) and (d).
	
	
	In relation to s 126B(4)(e), the likely effect upon the accused, he will suffer harm in a forensic sense but that is not the type of harm I believe the paragraph speaks of. It was contended that he will suffer harm ""in the form of a violation of his therapeutic relationship with his mental health practitioners"" (written submissions at [6]). However, he does not have any ongoing relationship with either of the doctors. He saw them only the once and that was nearly three years ago. No other potential harm to the accused was suggested. Accordingly, there is no call to consider any means to limit harm that is likely to be caused to him (s 126B(4)(f)).
	
	
	Clearly this is a criminal proceeding and the evidence is sought to be adduced by the prosecutor: s 126B(4)(g). The substance of the protected confidence has not already been disclosed by the accused or anyone else (aside from the confidants to the police, the prosecution, the accused and his lawyers and now the court): s 126B(4)(h).
	
	
	It is the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences (s 126B(4)(i)) that I consider to be the most vexing of matters militating in favour of making a direction that they not be adduced in evidence. It is a matter of concern that anything might be done that could dissuade people in the community from consulting medical practitioners, particularly mental health care specialists, and being fully frank with them.
	
	
	This is a matter that was prominent in the reasoning of Price J in excluding the evidence of a clinical nurse specialist in R v Leung [2012] NSWSC 1451. That was a case of manslaughter. It was the Crown case that the accused had killed his partner after an argument. The accused had been hysterical and police summoned the nurse to make an assessment of his risk of self-harm. The history she obtained included that there had been ""bad arguments"" that day, the previous day and a lot of arguments in the preceding weeks. In excluding the evidence, Price J said in part:
	


“[21] In the present case, Nurse Salmon, the confidant, was acting in a professional capacity and was under an express obligation not to disclose the contents of the interview, save for her assessment of the accused's risk of self-harm.

[22] Unlike that of a support person, the relationship between a clinical nurse specialist who is called to a police station to make a mental health assessment and an accused person is a protected relationship under s 126A Evidence Act. Ensuring that a person in custody is not a risk of self-harm is a matter of importance not only to the police force but to our society as a whole. It is fundamental to the reliability of the assessment that accused persons be able to speak freely to the health professional without fear that their conversation might be used in evidence against them. To be balanced against that consideration is the public interest in solving serious crimes such as manslaughter. However, it is unlikely that accused persons in custody would co-operate in a mental health assessment if they understood that the interview was not to be confidential.”


	
	I accept the evidence of both doctors that they adopted a policy of excluding from doctor/patient confidentiality anything that may bear upon a risk of self-harm or harm to others. The Crown only seeks the disclosure of that part of the account given by the accused to the doctors that is relevant to a question of harm to others. The distinction with R v Leung is that there the evidence in question was of an extraneous matter; the history of arguments with the deceased. It was quite separate from the topic of self-harm about which the nurse was authorised to make a disclosure. In the present case, the evidence in question is of a type that the doctors (and it would seem doctors generally) would consider being outside the scope of what is required to be kept confidential; a matter about which patients are usually informed.
	
	
	I considered it might be appropriate to make an order of the type envisaged by s 126E (hearing the evidence in camera) or a non-publication order under the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) in light of the public interest concerns that I had. However, having regard to what seems to be the general policy of medical, and particularly mental health, practitioners regarding confidentiality, and given that what is sought to be disclosed here is of a nature that would not necessarily attract absolute confidentiality, I have come to the view that there would either be no utility in doing so or that any such utility as it might have was outweighed by open justice principles.
	


Conclusion


	
	The evidence of disclosures made to Dr Susan Allman and Dr Matthew Boulton in the passages which the Crown Prosecutor identified in the transcript of 2 March 2015 at page 4 lines 25 to 35 are admissible and I decline to make a direction pursuant to s 126B of the Evidence Act that they not be adduced in the proceedings.

2424288,R v Hawi [2015] NSWSC 206,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR:
	


Course of proceedings

Anthony Zervas (the deceased) was killed in Terminal 3 at Sydney Airport on 22 March 2009 during a brawl between rival motorcycle clubs, the Hells Angels and the Comancheros. The offender was the national president of the Comancheros. The deceased was the brother of a Hells Angels member, Peter Zervas.


	
	Along with other members of the Comancheros the offender stood trial for murder on 24 May 2011. The trial ran for five months with the jury retiring on 29 September 2011. On 2 November 2011 the offender was convicted of murder and affray. On 10 April 2012 the offender was sentenced as follows:
	


Affray – Imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years and 6 months, commencing 16 May 2009.

Murder – Imprisonment for 28 years with a non-parole period of 21 years to commence on 16 November 2009.


	
	The offender appealed against his conviction for murder. On 16 May 2014 the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed his conviction for murder and ordered a retrial (Hawi v R [2014] NSWCCA 83). On 23 June 2014 the offender was granted bail by Harrison J (R v Hawi [2014] NSWSC 837). The bail conditions required that the offender be of good behaviour, report daily, observe a curfew between 8pm and 6am and abide by strict non-communication and non-association orders. As of that date, the offender had served a total of 5 years and 40 days in custody, all in maximum security. The sentence for the affray offence expired in its entirety on 5 November 2012.
	
	
	The offender first offered to plead guilty to manslaughter on 29 April 2011, approximately 10 days before the commencement of the trial. This offer was rejected by the Crown. On 4 June 2014 the offer to plead guilty to manslaughter was renewed and was accepted by the DPP on 25 July 2014. On 5 September 2014 the offender entered a plea of guilty to the offence of manslaughter before Johnson J on arraignment. The offender is now to be sentenced for the offence of manslaughter.
	


Factual background


	
	It has been agreed between the Crown and the offender that he is to be sentenced on the basis of the following facts. Accordingly, when passing sentence on the offender, I am precluded from taking into account other matters which arose during the trial, nor can I make further findings of fact. In other words, I am bound by the statement of agreed facts.
	
	
	There was ongoing hostility between the Comancheros and the Hells Angels motorcycle clubs in the period leading up to 22 March 2009. The offender had been the national president of the Comancheros since 2002. The club had a hierarchical structure with strict rules and a strong culture of loyalty between members of the club.
	
	
	On 21 March 2009 the offender flew to Melbourne with four other members of the Comancheros: Christian Menzies (Menzies), Ishmail Eken (Eken), Pomare Pirini (Pirini) and Maher Aouli (Aouli).
	
	
	On 22 March 2009 the offender returned on a Qantas flight to Sydney with Menzies, Eken, Pirini and Aouli. He was seated with Eken and Menzies on the flight. By chance Derek Wainohu (Wainohu), the president of the Hells Angels was travelling on the flight. Both Aouli and Wainohu contacted members of their respective clubs to come to the airport.
	
	
	Seven members or associates of the Comancheros subsequently arrived at the airport. Five of them went to Gate 5 while two of them, Fares Abounader (Abounader) and Usama Potrus (Potrus), remained outside security.
	
	
	Seven members or associates of the Hells Angels arrived at the airport. Of these seven men, Tom Baker (Baker) and David Padovan (Padovan) went to Gate 5. The remaining five men (Musa Ovalle, the deceased, Peter Zervas, Elias Khoury and Peter Martin) remained in the terminal and did not go through security to Gate 5 where the affray took place.
	
	
	There was a confrontation almost immediately after the passengers disembarked. The offender approached Wainohu on the concourse immediately opposite Gate 5. They argued. The offender noticed the group of Comancheros who had come to the airport approaching at a fast pace. Wainohu walked a short distance away and then returned. The offender threw a punch at him. Others became involved in the fighting and the offender ended on the ground fighting with Baker. A number of the Comancheros turned on Padovan and pursued him along the concourse kicking and punching him until he went to the ground where he was further kicked and punched. He lost his shirt at some stage of the assault.
	
	
	The fighting then broke up. The Comancheros regrouped. Padovan returned to Wainohu and Baker. Before the Comancheros left the scene, the offender called out threats in the direction of the Hells Angels. Witnesses gave evidence of him saying “You’re dead, you’re fucking dead”; “Next time we see you, you’re going to have bullet holes through you. You are a dead man walking.” Or “You’re a dead man, you’re fucking dead. You’ve got bullet holes in you.” The offender did not dispute that he said these things. He was angry.
	
	
	There were many members of the public at Gate 5 at the time of the affray, including children and elderly people. Many of them were shocked, horrified and scared by what they witnessed.
	
	
	The 10 Comanchero members, including the offender, exited the secured area and entered Terminal 3. They met up with Abounader and Potrus who had been waiting outside the secured area. The group of now 12 Comanchero members/associates then moved quickly in the direction of the group of 5 Hells Angels members/associates who were within the departure terminal behind the check in counters.
	
	
	When the two groups came together, there was a short verbal argument between the offender and Peter Zervas. The offender and another witness observed that Peter Zervas was wearing a knuckleduster. The deceased then moved, pulling his hood up over his head and from behind the offender attempted to stab him in the temple with a pair of scissors. The deceased did inflict some injury to the offender’s eye, his hand, his shoulder and his tricep. As the deceased moved forward in this manner, one of the Comancheros (mistakenly) yelled out “He’s got a nug” (meaning “He’s got gun”). At that point a fight erupted between the two groups.
	
	
	Anthony Zervas (the deceased) was 161cms tall and weighed 58kgs. He was found to have extremely high levels of cocaine and methadone in his system. The concentration of the blood level of cocaine was 25 times the median fatal concentration. If not for the physical injuries, Dr Duflou, a forensic pathologist, would have considered that this was the cause of death. He also had very high levels of methadone of 6.9mg/L, three times the highest level of fatal overdose in a recent study referred to by Dr Duflou in evidence. The deceased had inflicted similar injuries on an off duty police officer only days earlier.
	
	
	After the fight erupted behind the counters, it continued as the participants moved from behind the check in counters to the area at the front of the Terminal. The offender was part of the fighting group, which was moving through the check in counters.
	
	
	Eyewitnesses described the riot as breaking out with both sides fighting each other and punches flying everywhere, being an “all in brawl” with “everybody” punching. After the two groups moved to the area in front of the check in counters, the fighters broke off into smaller groups. Some eyewitnesses described men, including Hells Angels, picking up bollards, which have a heavy base and weigh about 12 kilograms, and using them in the general fighting (in addition to the assault upon the deceased). Witnesses spoke of the riot as “an explosion of fighting” and “a large group of men fighting incredibly violently and aggressively” and “chaotic and quite wild and uncontrolled”.
	
	
	The deceased was pursued to the front of the terminal where he ended on the ground near the glass wall. The fatal assault upon him took place as he lay on the ground within a metre or two of an elderly couple who were seated on a bench waiting for a wheelchair. A member of the Comancheros (not the offender) picked up a bollard vertically and rammed it downwards so that the base of it struck the deceased when he was on the ground, causing severe head injuries which were fatal.
	
	
	The deceased died from the combined effects of blunt force injuries to the head and stab wounds to the chest and abdomen. There were three stab wounds, at least one inflicted by a pair of scissors. The stab wounds injured the right lung, liver, stomach and caused significant internal bleeding. The deceased’s head injuries were severe and included extensive fracturing at the base of the skull, bleeding over the surface of the brain and bruising of the brain tissue. He died at the scene.
	
	
	The offender is depicted in footage recorded by a tourist (the “Deng footage”) as being in the vicinity of the fatal assault and then immediately moving towards the exit doors. It is not alleged that he was part of the fatal assault upon the deceased. He shortly afterwards left the terminal in a taxi with Menzies, La Rosa and others.
	
	
	The riot took place over a very short time. The physical fighting occupied less than one minute. From the time that the deceased attempted to stab the offender in the temple, to the time that the offender left the airport, was approximately 36 seconds. A large number of people in the airport witnessed the violence which they found terrifying and distressing.
	
	
	In relation to this offence of manslaughter, the offender was part of a joint criminal enterprise to commit an unlawful and dangerous act, namely the physical assault on one or more of the Hells Angels realising there was an appreciable risk of serious injury being occasioned to a person. The offender entered into the joint criminal enterprise as the two groups came together.
	


Seriousness of the offending


	
	The objective seriousness of the offending was substantial. In reaching that conclusion, I accept that the death of the deceased was not something which was planned. Nevertheless, it was the product of actions of the offender and those with him which brought about an appreciable risk of serious injury being occasioned. It is also of significance that the group of 5 Hells Angels were heavily outnumbered when the 12 Comancheros moved quickly in their direction within the departure terminal behind the check in counters. This increased the risk of serious injury being occasioned.
	
	
	Although the offender did not play a physical role in the assault on the deceased, he was part of the group of men who were fighting as they came through the check in counters. The extent and ferocity of the fighting is described at [18] - [19] hereof. The extent of the injuries suffered by the deceased is indicative of this ferocity.
	
	
	An aggravating factor of the conduct which constituted this offence was that it took place at the airport in the presence of many innocent bystanders. In R v Menzies [2012] NSWSC 158 at [48] R A Hulme J said:
	


“48   A matter that is particularly relevant in assessing the objective seriousness of the manslaughter is the location in which it occurred. The participants in the joint enterprise to fight were prepared to engage in wanton and significant violence regardless of the presence of many airline and airport staff and members of the public. An airport terminal is a place where people are entitled to expect safety and security. There were elderly people and small children present. A significant number of those who witnessed the events were utterly distressed and fearful. …”


	
	In the same judgment at [80] – [81] his Honour said:
	


“80   More important, however, is general deterrence; that is, the deterrence of others. It was brazen and arrogant for the offender and his Comanchero colleagues to further their ongoing dispute with the Hells Angels by carrying out a violent attack in such a public place as an airport terminal.

81   As I have said in other sentence proceedings, it is a regrettable and distressing fact that wars between rival bikie gangs occur from time to time. Those who perpetrate serious violence or property damage in pursuit of such wars must know that significant punishment awaits them upon detection. However, when the violence spills out into the public arena, as exemplified by this case, a clear message must be sent that it will be met by punishment that is severe.”


	
	R A Hulme J made a similar assessment of such conduct in a public place in R v Pirini [2011] NSWSC 1395 at [39] – [40]:
	


“39   Members of the community have an entitlement to feel safe and secure in public places. The selfish and mindless arrogance of those who perpetrate extreme levels of violence for their own ends with complete disregard for others warrants the strongest condemnation.

40   It is necessary in the assessment of sentence to denounce the offender's conduct. It must be made clear to him, and others who may contemplate acting in such a way, that such conduct will be met with condign punishment. Aggressive and violent conduct between rival gang members in public places simply will not be tolerated, the more so where there is an appreciable risk of somebody suffering serious injury. That risk, in what occurred in this case in the departure hall, was high indeed. The offender must be punished and made accountable for his part in this tragic affair.”


	
	I fully endorse those comments of R A Hulme J and regard them as applicable to the offender’s participation in such conduct. I take those matters into account when assessing the objective seriousness of the offending in this case.
	
	
	Another matter which is relevant to the objective seriousness of the offending is the offender’s position as national president of the Comancheros, a hierarchical organisation with a strong culture of loyalty between members. This was a position which at the time of the deceased’s death the offender had held for almost 7 years. This is not to say that the offender is being sentenced for holding that position, nor is the position per se an aggravating factor. The aggravating factor is that he was a willing participant in the brawl. His presence and participation would undoubtedly have had the effect of authorising and approving the actions of other Comanchero participants, in particular the person who bludgeoned the deceased to death. In an organisation such as the Comancheros, being in a command position such as national president, inevitably involves some responsibility for the actions of club members in circumstances where he was present.
	
	
	By way of mitigation there were elements of provocation on the part of the deceased in that he precipitated the actual physical violence by attacking the offender with a pair of scissors and causing injury to him. It needs, however, to be kept in mind that at that point in time there had already been a short verbal argument between the offender and Peter Zervas and that the Comancheros had moved quickly towards the Hells Angels.
	


Subjective features


	
	The offender did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings. Evidence as to his personal circumstances came from the report of a psychologist, Tim Watson-Munro, dated 23 February 2012 and affidavits from his wife, relatives and friends, and of course the material I received today.
	
	
	The offender was born in Beirut, Lebanon in June 1980 and is now aged 34. He was 28 at the time of the offences. He has a close relationship with his parents, brother and three sisters. The family moved to Australia in 1985. After obtaining his school certificate at the age of about 16, he left high school to attend TAFE and take an apprenticeship in his father’s spray painting business where he worked for 3 – 4 years. He then bought a car detailing business before establishing a refrigerated transport company in 2007. He was running this business until he went into custody. The refrigerated transport business ceased operation when he went into custody. He had been a member of the Comancheros from the age of 18.
	
	
	The offender does not have a history of drug or alcohol abuse. Before his incarceration he appears to have led a settled life characterised by self employment and involvement with his family. He began his relationship with his wife in 1995 and they were married in 2002. He has 2 sons, aged 11 and 5. Their second son was born shortly after the offender was arrested for murder and remanded in custody. During the course of these sentence proceedings, he lost his third child who was born prematurely in January 2015.
	
	
	Mr Watson-Munro stated that the offender exhibited some regret referable to the deceased and accepted responsibility for the affray, although he had not demonstrated remorse or accepted responsibility for the death of the deceased. Mr Watson-Munro found that the offender was suffering a chronic anxiety disorder referable to his incarceration compounded by depression in connection with separation from his family.
	
	
	This has been the offender’s first period of full time imprisonment. His criminal history includes a finding of guilt for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 1996 in the Children’s Court when he was aged 16. He has been convicted of a number of driving offences and received penalties which include a 3 month suspended sentence of imprisonment for driving while disqualified. He was fined for using offensive language and in 2005 was fined for possession of a prescribed restricted substance. Having regard to the nature of these offences and when they were committed, this is not a significant record of previous convictions.
	


Remorse


	
	His cousin, Hassan Hijazi, referred in his affidavit, to the offender expressing regret about the death of the deceased. He was of the opinion that the offender’s attitude to what happened at the airport had changed since his time in prison. Talal Eloss, a friend, said in his affidavit that following his release from prison the offender expressed sorrow for what the deceased’s mother was going through and said that he regretted “everything that happened”.
	
	
	I accept that the original offer to plead guilty to the offence of manslaughter and its subsequent renewal is evidence of remorse on the offender’s part.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I am prepared to accept that in contrast to when he was sentenced by R A Hulme J in April 2012, the offender now has some remorse for his part in what happened to the deceased at the airport.
	


Rehabilitation prospects and likelihood of re-offending


	
	The Corrective Service notes record that the offender was generally calm, polite, compliant and co-operative while in prison. It was noted that when working he had a good attendance record and got on with both staff and other inmates. Despite the occurrence of two minor incidents while in custody, the majority of entries in his case notes were positive and his good behaviour was often cited.
	
	
	Since his release from custody, the offender has undertaken work with Recon Group, as well as voluntary work with an indigenous community based program called Recon Indigenous Group. This program is operated for indigenous people with disadvantaged backgrounds in order to help them with developing skills and job placement. His wife, relatives and friends have attested in their affidavits to the offender being a changed person since his release from custody. The offender has also worked voluntarily at Al Zahra Funeral Services with a view to giving back to the community and assisting grieving families. The offender has complied with his bail conditions, both before trial and after his appeal.
	
	
	The offender told Mr Watson-Munro that he had been replaced as national president of the Comancheros. His wife stated in her affidavit that he had told her that he “wants nothing more to do with the club” and has not associated with members of the club.
	
	
	The offender’s present relationship with the Comancheros is not particularly clear. There is no evidence of any contact between him and the Comancheros since he was released on bail. Corrective Service records of visitors to him while he was in custody show that he was regularly visited by persons who are or were members of the Comancheros. Those visits continued up to May 2014. There has been no suggestion of any unlawful conduct associated with these visits.
	
	
	While it is difficult to predict future behaviour, the support that the offender is receiving from his family and friends, his strong record of employment and the absence of any history of drug or alcohol abuse, and the absence of significant previous convictions, all support the proposition that he has good rehabilitation prospects and that there is little likelihood of him re-offending. My hesitation in making an unqualified finding to that effect is the fact of the visits to him while in custody up to May 2014 by present or former members of the Comancheros. On balance, however, I am prepared to find that the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation and not re-offending are good.
	


Custodial conditions


	
	It was common ground that the offender was held on non-association (PRNA) for approximately 6 months. He was held on limited association (PRLA) for approximately 3 months. Otherwise, although held in maximum security, he was part of the normal prison population. In addition, during the committal and trial, it was necessary for him to rise early and not return to his cell until late in the evening as a result of the need to travel to and from court each day in a prison truck. The last relevant matter is that the offender has been subject to and has complied with bail conditions while at liberty since 23 June 2014. I have taken into account those matters, in particular the onerous conditions of custody when the offender was held when subject to PRNA and PRLA.
	


Discount for plea of guilty


	
	There was an issue as to the extent of the discount to which the offender was entitled for his plea of guilty. The offender submitted that he was entitled to a discount of 20 percent, whereas the Crown submitted that 15 percent was appropriate.
	
	
	The offender was charged with murder on 30 June 2009. A committal hearing took place over several weeks, commencing July 2010 and culminating in him being committed for trial on 23 September 2010. On 25 November 2010 the offender was arraigned in the Supreme Court whereupon he entered pleas of not guilty and the matter was listed for trial commencing 9 May 2011. The offender’s first offer to plead guilty to manslaughter was made on 29 April 2011 and was rejected before 9 May 2011.
	
	
	The Crown sought to rationalise the discounts for pleas of guilty by reference to other Comancheros who had been charged with offences arising from what had occurred at the airport. The Crown submitted that those who pleaded guilty, or offered to plead guilty (such offers being rejected by the Crown) at arraignment should receive a reduction in sentence of 20 percent. Those who pleaded guilty at the trial should receive a reduction in sentence of 12.5 percent. The Crown noted that La Rosa pleaded guilty one month before trial and received a reduction in sentence of 15 percent for his plea. Abounader made an offer to plead guilty to manslaughter on the first day of trial but the offer was rejected. He then pleaded guilty to riot prior to his re-trial on a charge of manslaughter and received a discount in sentence of 15 percent. Menzies made no formal offer before the first trial but pleaded guilty to manslaughter at his arraignment on the re-trial and received a discount of sentence of 15 percent.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the timing and circumstances of the offender’s first offer to plead guilty, made approximately nine days before the day fixed for the commencement of the first trial, and then the plea of guilty on arraignment before the retrial, were such that a similar reduction in sentence to that received by La Rosa, Abounader and Menzies would be appropriate.
	
	
	I do not agree. The circumstances in which the offender came to plead guilty are very different to those relating to Menzies and different to La Rosa and Abounader, although closer than in the case of Menzies. It also needs to be kept in mind that the offer to plead guilty to manslaughter before the retrial on murder was of considerable utility because even though he was the only defendant, the trial would have been lengthy. An appropriate discount for the offender’s plea of guilty is 17½ percent.
	


Parity


	
	The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years. The offence covers a wide variety of circumstances calling for a wide variety of penalties and other cases do not necessarily set a “range” (R v Green [1999] NSWCCA 97 at [24]). In the present case, however, a number of co-offenders have been sentenced for manslaughter arising out of the same incident.
	
	
	Pirini pleaded guilty to affray and manslaughter at arraignment, before the first trial. The circumstances of Pirini’s offending were similar to those of the present offender, although he did not hold a senior position in the Comanchero organisation (R v Pirini [2011] NSWSC 1395).
	
	
	Pirini engaged in a fight with an opposing club member in the check-in area. He was not involved with the fatal assault upon the deceased. He was not alleged to have been involved in any planning. Pirini gave evidence of his remorse, which was found to be genuine, and he was found to have a good subjective case overall. A reduction of 20 percent was allowed for his plea of guilty. After this discount, a sentence of 6 years for the manslaughter with a non-parole period of 3 years was imposed to be partially accumulated by 6 months onto his affray sentence.
	
	
	La Rosa pleaded guilty on 8 April 2011 to affray and manslaughter. He also was not sentenced for directly causing the death of the deceased but for participation in a joint criminal enterprise on the same basis as Pirini and the offender. His role in the brawl did not involve any physical fighting but he was willing to assist if required. The sentencing judge was satisfied, having heard his oral evidence, that the offender was genuinely remorseful and had otherwise a number of mitigating factors in his favour. However, he was on bail for a driving offence at the time. La Rosa was sentenced with a starting point sentence of 7 years 9 months, discounted by 15 percent for his plea of guilty, resulting in a sentence of 6 years and 7 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months.
	
	
	Tiago Costa (Costa) pleaded guilty on 9 May 2011 to affray and manslaughter. Costa was one of the men who had attended the airport in response to the call. He was also not sentenced for directly causing the death of the deceased but for participation in a joint criminal enterprise on the same basis as Pirini, La Rosa and the offender. The sentencing judge found that the culpability of Costa and Pirini were “virtually indistinguishable” (R v Costa [2011] NSWSC 1392 at [37]).
	
	
	He also found that Costa presented a favourable subjective case and imposed the same starting sentence of 7 years and 6 months as he had imposed upon Pirini but with a discount of 12.5 percent for his plea on the first day of trial, resulting in a sentence of 6 years 7 months for the manslaughter with a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months.
	
	
	Menzies was acquitted of murder at trial and the jury were unable to reach a verdict in relation to manslaughter. He was found guilty of affray. He subsequently entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter at arraignment on 2 December 2011. His plea to manslaughter was on the basis that he was not directly involved in the fatal assault upon the deceased but was complicit in the killing by virtue of being a participant in the joint criminal enterprise (R v Menzies [2012] NSWSC 158 at [40]).
	
	
	The sentencing judge found that Menzies’ involvement in the events in the departure hall was “greater than those already sentenced for the same offence” (at [84]). Menzies had a criminal history which included offences of violence in public places and a history of drug use and therefore was not of prior good character. He left the Comancheros while in custody and his remorse was accepted as genuine. The sentencing judge took into account that the custodial conditions during the lengthy trial were onerous and stated “While this is not a major factor in mitigation, it is something to which I have regard” (at [73]). Menzies received a starting point sentence of 8 years and 5 months for manslaughter. After a reduction of 15 percent for his plea of guilty, this resulted in a sentence of 7 years 2 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 8 months.
	
	
	When passing sentence on the offender, I have had regard to the sentences imposed on Pirini, La Rosa, Costa and Menzies.
	


Special circumstances


	
	The offender submitted that by reference to those other Comancheros who had been sentenced for manslaughter, he had already served approximately 1½ - 2 years longer in custody when compared with the non-parole periods in their sentences. He noted that all of those persons had now been released from custody and granted parole without incident. The offender drew the Court’s attention to a letter from the State Parole Authority (SPA) dated 21 November 2014 which indicated “It is not possible for the Authority to convene at short notice”. The offender submitted that the practical consequence of this was that should a sentence of longer than 3 years’ imprisonment be imposed on him (even if backdated with a non-parole period expiring before the sentencing date), it was inevitable that he would be returned to custody. The offender submitted that he was likely to remain in custody pending the obtaining of reports as required under s135(2) Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999, the convening of the SPA and a determination by the SPA.
	
	
	The offender submitted that these considerations, together with the fact that he had already served over 5 years in custody, created an unusual and in many respects unique circumstance which called for flexibility of approach in sentencing. The offender submitted that while as a rule of practice a court should generally backdate a sentence to take into account pre-sentence custody, there were occasions when that practice might be departed from (R v Leete [2001] NSWCCA 337; 125 A Crim R 37). He submitted that s 24(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 did not prescribe any mode for taking into account the time for which an offender had been held in custody.
	
	
	By reference to such cases as R v Caroll; Caroll v R [2010] NSWCCA 55; 77 NSWLR 45 at [65] and Lavender v R [2006] NSWCCA 24 he submitted that a sentencing judge should have regard to the fact that an offender “has been buffeted by the legal system in a manner which must be recognised”. The offender submitted that in accordance with that approach, the sentence to be imposed on him should be of such a kind that it would avoid him being returned to custody for an indefinite period while reports were obtained, the SPA convened and the SPA reached a determination.
	
	
	The suggestion for achieving such a result put forward by the offender was for a sentence of less than 3 years to be imposed, having regard to the custody already served. In the alternative, he submitted that he should be sentenced to a suspended sentence for a period of at most 2 years with conditions akin to those that would be imposed on parole to be immediately suspended upon him entering into those conditions. Such conditions might include residential, good behaviour and non-association conditions. The offender submitted that another alternative taking into account time served would be the imposition of good behaviour bonds under s 9 together with similar conditions.
	
	
	The offender submitted that taking into account time served, it was open to the Court to backdate the commencement date of a sentence so that the sentence amounted to 3 years or less thereby enabling the Court to fix a parole period with conditions as ordered by the Court. The offender submitted that taking into account the maximum penalty, the circumstances of the offence, his personal circumstances, the principle of parity and time served, the Court should impose a sentence that allowed him to remain in the community with no further time to serve in custody and would avoid the consequence of a disproportionate sentence.
	
	
	It is true that the offender finds himself potentially in an unfortunate situation where it may be necessary for him to be returned to custody so as to allow the steps set out in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to be taken. It is, however, not part of this Court’s function to engage in a process of prediction about what executive or administrative action might be taken in relation to a prisoner’s custody, if a proper and appropriate sentence is imposed.
	
	
	The usual and preferable course for taking into account pre-sentence custody is to backdate the sentence imposed to reflect the time already served while still pronouncing the appropriate sentence for the offence and the offender: Wiggins v R [2010] NSWCCA 30 at [3] – [8]. The reasons in favour of backdating, rather than “discounting”, were set out by Howie J in R v Newman; R v Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102; 145 A Crim R 361 at [27] where his Honour said:
	


“27    In my view, although there is an element of fiction involved in backdating a sentence to a period when the offender was not in custody, there is much to be said in its favour. Firstly, it preserves the denunciatory and deterrent value of the sentence to be pronounced. If a sentence is decreased by a substantial period already served in custody, it can have the appearance of being inadequate both to public perception and when it appears in the statistical information that is now so often relied upon by sentencing courts. This was one of the reasons expressed in McHugh for the adoption of the practice and it remains a highly important consideration.”


	
	This passage was approved by Kirby J in Abdul-Kadir v R [2007] NSWCCA 329; 178 A Crim R 281.
	
	
	Those considerations are particularly relevant in a case such as this which had such a high public profile and where there is a significant public interest in an appropriate sentence being imposed. I have concluded that the appropriate course is to sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment which adequately reflects the criminality involved in this offence and properly reflects principles of denunciation and general deterrence, as well as taking into account the particular features applicable to this offender (many of which are favourable) by backdating the sentence. Any other approach, in particular an approach designed to avoid the offender returning to custody, would result in a sentence which would be an inadequate sentence in terms of the public record and other principles referred to in R v Newman; R v Simpson.
	
	
	It is not without significance that in R v Aouli [2011] NSWSC 1393 at [96] R A Hulme J said:
	


“96   Finally, it was submitted that I should take into account the time to date that the offender has been in custody and reduce the sentence I impose by an equivalent period. It was submitted that this would produce a sentence that would carry with it an entitlement to parole release, as opposed to an eligibility that would need to be considered by the Parole Authority. Whilst I acknowledge that I have a discretion in this respect, I do not propose to follow such a course. In my view, the consideration that there should be a sentence which openly and transparently demonstrates the seriousness with which the offences are regarded, balanced appropriately against all of the other circumstances of the case, should prevail.”

I respectfully agree with that approach and propose to apply it.


	
	This approach means that the offender will be subject to the processes and supervision of the SPA. In that regard, it should be remembered that the non-parole period is a minimum period of actual incarceration that an offender must spend in full time custody, having regard to all elements of punishment: Power v R [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 at 628-629.
	
	
	Except in the case of sentences of 3 years or less, a non-parole period is not a maximum period of fulltime imprisonment with an automatic right to release to parole. Whenever a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for a term greater than 3 years, release to parole and the terms of the parole order are matters solely for the parole authority: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [4]. An appropriate sentence in this case, taking into account principles of punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation is a sentence of substantially more than 3 years. In such a case the legislature contemplates that a release on parole is a matter for the authorities and not the sentencing court: Wilson v R [2008] NSWCCA 245 at [29].
	
	
	Given the somewhat unusual circumstances in which the offender finds himself I am prepared to find special circumstances for the purpose of adjusting the ratio between the parole and non-parole periods in accordance with s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Conclusion and sentence


	
	Engaging in a process of instinctive synthesis with the maximum penalty taking its place as a yardstick, but also having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence, the offender’s positive subjective case and the principle of parity, together with the other matters to which I have referred, I take as the starting point a head sentence of 7 years and 6 months. After the 17½ percent discount for the utility of the plea of guilty, the head sentence becomes 6 years and 2 months. I fix a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. In accordance with the approach followed in relation to the other offenders involved in this incident, I propose to accumulate the sentence for manslaughter by 6 months on the sentence for affray.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of manslaughter, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months commencing 16 November 2009 and expiring 15 May 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years and 8 months expiring 15 January 2016.

2424395,Betts v R [2015] NSWCCA 39,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA: I agree with RS Hulme AJ.
	
	
	HIDDEN J: I agree with RS Hulme AJ.
	
	
	RS HULME AJ:  This offender was sentenced on 18 May 2012 by Toner SC DCJ for two offences. The first was of wounding Samantha Holland with intent to murder, an offence contrary to s 27 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and one which attracts a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 10 years has been prescribed.
	
	
	The second offence was of detaining Samantha Holland without her consent and with the intent of obtaining a psychological advantage and, before the detaining actual bodily harm was occasioned to her. This offence is contrary to s 86(2B) of the Crimes Act and attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	In arriving at the sentences he imposed Toner DCJ allowed a discount for the utilitarian value of the Applicant’s pleas of 10%. The sentences imposed were, on the detention charge, a fixed term of imprisonment of eight years commencing on 17 April 2010 and on the wounding with intent to murder charge, imprisonment for 16 years, including a non-parole period of 11 years, both such periods to commence on 17 April 2010.
	
	
	The Applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. The grounds of appeal are:
	



	
	His Honour erred in concluding that the offences were aggravated, within the meaning of s 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999,  because the injury sustained by the victim was substantial, but then in circumstances where the substantial nature of the injury was an element of each offence.
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding that the offences were aggravated, because the victim was “vulnerable"" within the meaning of s 21A(2)(l) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	His Honour erred in failing to recognise the injuries suffered by the applicant as amounting to extra-curial punishment.
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding that the effect of the applicant’s injuries were relevant only to the question of special circumstances, and thus only to the term to be served by way of the non-parole period, rather than relevant also to the head sentence.
	



	
	The Applicant and Ms Holland had been in a relationship for some years. By 5 April 2010 the relationship had broken down. Ms Holland had moved out of the unit they had shared together with some of her possessions. The Applicant told her that he would be moving out of that unit on the weekend of 17 and 18 April, he would move his belongings out on 17 April and would be gone by 10.30am. Ms Holland told him she would arrive after he had left. She arrived at the block of units at about 11.10am but on entering the unit they had shared, saw that the Applicant was still there. A discussion took place during which the Applicant kept reiterating there was no reason for them to be apart to which Ms Holland responded to the effect “the damage to our relationship has already been done.""
	
	
	After something over an hour, Ms Holland said “… I’m done. It’s over. I’m going downstairs to let Todd [her brother] in.”
	
	
	The Applicant blocked Ms Holland’s access to the front door, then moved out of the way and as the victim turned the door handle, she was pulled back by the Applicant and he started stabbing Ms Holland repeatedly in the back with a knife. He was then holding her around the chest/waist and moving her towards the kitchen.
	
	
	At one point she went to the kitchen floor and recalls the Applicant straddling her and continuing to stab her. She made two further attempts to escape out the front door but was stopped. He stabbed himself, cut his left wrist, stabbed himself in the neck and again stabbed the victim. He said to the victim, “We will die here together, then we can be together for eternity.”
	
	
	The Applicant moved to stab the victim in the chest but she asked him not to stab her there and he rolled her over and stabbed her a number of times in the back. The victim believed her only chance to escape was to calm the offender and weaken him. She said, “If we are going to do this together, then I should have a turn with the knife.” The tip of the knife the offender then had had broken and was embedded in the victim’s back so the offender grabbed another knife from the kitchen, handed it to the victim and said “Okay” and lay on his back. The victim stabbed the Applicant in the stomach, giving an extra shove to make sure the knife was in deep and she twisted it. It appeared that some of the Applicant’s intestines came out, the Applicant remarking “That was a good one.”
	
	
	There was further stabbing by each, another unsuccessful attempt by the victim to escape and the Applicant stabbed himself four times in the leg.
	
	
	With a view to answering the phone, the Applicant left the victim. She commenced to escape over a balcony railing but the Applicant pulled her back. Shortly afterwards she passed out. Later she encouraged the Applicant to lie on the bed with her and sometime later he appeared to be passing in and out of consciousness. She again attempted to escape via the balcony, this time managing to swing onto the balcony of the floor below hitting her back on its railings. After discovering that the door from the lower balcony was locked, she climbed over its rail intending to repeat the exercise. She noticed people in the street and called for their help. Someone in that group rang 000, the first call recorded being at 1.54pm.
	
	
	The victim had arrived at the unit at about 11.11am. Her brother arrived some time later with a view to helping her and at 12.23pm she sent him a text message saying “Give me a couple of minutes [the Applicant] is here. Sorry.” At about 1.40pm a real estate agent had opened the front door of the unit for the purposes of an inspection, but seeing red liquid everywhere, he shut the door and left.
	
	
	The time of the first offence by the Applicant is not recorded but his attack on her must have continued for a very substantial period. The sentencing judge proceeded on the basis that the attack extended over a period of about 40 to 45 minutes.
	
	
	Police attended, they located two blood stained knives and the Applicant and Ms Holland were taken to hospital.
	
	
	The wounds suffered by Ms Holland were:
	


20 stab wounds to her back.

A 20mm laceration to her upper right neck.

A 20mm laceration to the right side of her chin.

A 10mm laceration to her left shoulder.

A 10mm laceration to her upper left arm.

Three further 5-10mm lacerations.

Two collapsed/punctured lungs.

A fracture to the spinous process of her eighth thoracic vertebra.


	
	The Applicant’s wounds included:
	


Multiple stab wounds to his neck, back and flanks including one with abdominal content protruding.

Full penetrating wounds to the right thigh.

A collapsed punctured lung.


	
	The Applicant was treated at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital between 17 and 23 April. On 24 April he was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital for treatment of complications remaining there for a further five days. He was then discharged to the Long Bay (Prison) Hospital where he remained for a further five weeks.
	
	
	His Honour found that the offences were planned and it was simply a matter of luck that the Applicant failed in his intention to kill Ms Holland. His Honour concluded that the offence of wounding with intent to murder “represents a sustained and determined attempt to kill Ms Holland and thus represents a very serious example of its type.” His Honour also observed:
	


“I find from her victim impact statement that her injuries and disabilities, both physical and psychological, constitute both injury and emotional harm which was and is substantial and thus aggravating these offences. Further, I am of the view that she was vulnerable. She was alone in the apartment with the offender and to a significant extent, was at his mercy, albeit that she, as the facts show, acquitted herself with great courage and intelligence during this prolonged horror. I find this an aggravating feature of these crimes.”


	
	His Honour was asked to find that the Applicant had suffered “extra curial-punishment” by reason of the injuries suffered during his attempt to kill Ms Holland and secondly, at the hands of more than one person since he went to jail.
	
	
	His Honour found in the Applicant’s favour in respect of the second of these matters but in respect of the first observed as follows:
	


“There is no doubt that the injuries he suffered were very substantial and have left him with significant ongoing disabilities, including what appears to be permanent difficulties in controlling his bowel movements. The cause of those injuries is revealed within the facts, as I have found them, beyond reasonable doubt. Some of them were at his own hands, and others were injuries that were inflicted by Ms Holland in the context of those facts.

…

It seems to me that in considering the circumstances in which these injuries occurred the crucial matter in determining whether any mitigation should be allowed in the sentence which otherwise would be imposed – in other words the circumstances themselves – here the undoubted injuries which the offender suffered were in circumstances where the injuries incurred were intrinsic to the commission of the offence itself, not collateral to it. I find that it was the offender’s ambition to kill himself, and to kill Ms Holland. To find that because he failed to do so, in other words failed to achieve that ambition and merely suffered injuries as a result of his attempts, either at his own hand, or as a result of his invitation to her to stab him, would in essence be most obscene, and would legitimately be seen not only by Ms Holland, but by the community, as subversive to the rule of law.

I do not propose to mitigate the sentence because of the injuries suffered during his attempt to murder Ms Holland whilst he held her hostage.

…

I turn to the question of special circumstances. It was submitted that I ought to find special circumstances in this case. He has no prior criminal history, and thus of course he has not been to gaol before. He has significant ongoing serious medical problems as a result of the injuries he suffered during the commission of his crimes.

I accept his evidence that in gaol an effect of his bowel and abdominal injuries has been an inability to readily control his bowel movements. This has proved difficult for him in custody in that toilets are not readily available. This causes both significant discomfort and embarrassment. Because of these injuries he needs dietary supervision. He has lost a lot of weight since these offences as a result of the injuries suffered. Thus I find special circumstances.”


	
	I turn to the grounds of appeal.
	


Ground 1

His Honour erred in concluding that the offences were aggravated, within the meaning of s 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, because the injury sustained by the victim was substantial, but then in circumstances where the substantial nature of the injury was an element of each offence. 


	
	Section 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) requires the Court to take into account a number of specified aggravating factors. These include:
	


(g)   the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial.

…

(l)   the victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim’s occupation (such as a taxi driver, bus driver or other public transport worker, bank teller or service station attendant),


	
	The sub-section provides that the Court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.
	
	
	An element of the offence under s 27 which was charged was that the Applicant wounded Ms Holland. An element of the detention charge was that actual bodily harm was occasioned to her. A “wound” is an injury involving the breaking or cutting of the interior layer of the skin but requires nothing more. “Actual bodily harm” includes any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of a victim providing it is more than merely transient or trifling.
	
	
	Clearly the injury and harm suffered by Ms Holland greatly exceeded these elements understood in the way I have explained. The first ground of appeal fails.
	


Ground 2

His Honour erred in finding that the offences were aggravated, because the victim was “vulnerable”, within the meaning of s 21A(2)(l) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.


	
	When considering Ground 1 I have set out s 21A(2)(l).
	
	
	The authorities make clear that sub-paragraph (l) “is concerned with the weakness of a particular class of victim and not with the threat posed by a particular class of offender” and that “the examples set out in the sub-paragraph suggest that it is vulnerability of a particular kind that attracts its operation” and the fact that a victim does not have the characteristics of a powerful offender with violent tendencies does not make the victim vulnerable within the meaning of sub-paragraph (l) – see R v Williams [2005] NSWCCA 99 at [40], [41]; R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145; (2005) 65 NSWLR 740 at [26], [27]. The paragraph looks to the circumstances of groups or classes of victims inherent in their situation or characteristics as such divorced from any actions of an offender.
	
	
	In finding that the victim was vulnerable because she was alone in the apartment with the offender and at his mercy indicates that his Honour did not direct attention to the correct operation and limits of sub-paragraph (l). While in one sense the complainant was vulnerable, that vulnerability arose because of the particular events of the day, not because of the characteristics of any group of which she was a member. Those events included that the applicant was able to prevent the victim from communicating with her family by taking her mobile phone and replying to text messages from her brother who was waiting downstairs. Accordingly, his Honour erred and this ground of appeal is made out.
	


Ground 3

His Honour erred in failing to recognise the injuries suffered by the applicant as amounting to extra-curial punishment.


	
	In addressing this issue, Toner DCJ made the remarks I have set out above.
	
	
	In Christodoulou v R [2008] NSWCCA 102 the offender had committed offences of assault, intimidation and malicious damage. During the last of these offences he impaled himself with a syringe. When police arrived he threatened to inject himself if they came closer and he continued offending. At some stage the contents of the syringe which consisted of hydrochloric acid or battery acid did enter the offender’s arm resulting in a substantial and permanent disability to it. Grove J with the concurrence of Johnson J declined to regard the disability as extra-curial punishment. His Honour observed at [39]-[42]:
	


“39. In Alameddine v R [2006] NSWCCA 317 the offender suffered extensive injuries when, in seeking to destroy evidence of amphetamine manufacture in a laboratory before the foreshadowed arrival of police, an explosion was initiated and the offender burned in the ensuing fire. An examination of authorities in that case included reference to R v Haddara [1997] 95 A Crim R 108 where an arsonist had been injured in a fire which he lit and Brooking JA in the Victorian Court of Appeal observed that the sentencing judge was right to treat the injuries as going to mitigation. With the concurrence of Kirby and Hislop JJ in Alameddine I concluded:

""... there is a strong current of judicial opinion against outright rejection of the possibility of mitigation even where the injury is self inflicted or induced by the activity of the offender.""

40. I added the qualification:

""To the extent that the Crown submitted that there was a boundary created by injury sustained by self-inflicted illegal activity beyond which no mitigation could be granted, I would reject it. That is not to say that the circumstances of infliction are irrelevant but to deny that, once injury is sustained by the action of the offender in the course of committing the crime, the consequences are incapable of giving rise to a factor of mitigation.""

41. It is a step beyond Alameddine (and Haddara) to seek to extend the availability of a mitigatory element to a deliberately self-inflicted injury as distinguished from occasions where the injury was, although self-inflicted and in the course of crime commission, unintentional.

42. Insofar as the taking into account of extra curial punishment may be described as a principle, there is no authority for extending it to deliberately caused injury and such an extension should not, in my opinion, be recognized.”


	
	In Cvetkovic v R [2013] NSWCCA 66, the Applicant had seriously injured his wife by stabbing her with a gyprock saw. After she had escaped from the car in which she had been attacked the Applicant stabbed himself inflicting at least five wounds to his chest, five to his abdomen, some to his neck and a punctured lung. Some hours after these events the offender had told police that he wanted to terminate “our lives”, a reference in the context of the conversation to his wife and himself. This Court held that the sentencing judge had not erred in following Christodoulou v R and in not placing much or any weight on the harm the offender had done to himself. In dismissing a special leave application by Mr Cvetkovic from the decision of this Court, Bell and Gageler JJ remarked that “An appeal on the ground that Christodoulou v The Queen was wrongly decided would enjoy insufficient prospects of success to warrant a grant of special leave to appeal”. - Dragan Cvetkovic v The Queen [2013] HCASL 131.
	
	
	In R v SS [2010] NSWSC 1169, the offender had set fire to her room in an attempt to end her own life. She was however rescued, badly burnt. Distinguishing Christodoulou v R upon the basis that the injury in that case arose after the offences had been committed and were inflicted by the offender upon herself as a means of evading arrest, Kirby J held that the injuries SS suffered could be characterised as extra-judicial punishment. Kirby J continued:
	


“Here, the injuries were a consequence of the offence itself. It may be accepted that SS intended death, not the shocking injuries that she sustained. They are the consequence of her rescue. They may be characterised as extra judicial punishment. The words of the Victorian Full Court in R v Barci (1994) 76 A Crim R 103 are apposite. In the context of serious injuries inflicted upon the offender in the course of a robbery, the Court said this: (at [111])

For the rest of his life, those injuries will serve as a savage reminder to Barci of his criminality, and as such, they must fairly be regarded as constituting some punishment for that criminality.”


	
	Whether Kirby J was correct to distinguish Christodoulou v R as he did, the injuries suffered by the Applicant here were deliberately self-inflicted or inflicted at the Applicant’s instigation and intimately bound up with the Applicant’s criminal conduct. There was no basis advanced upon which this Court could conclude that Christodoulou v R was wrongly decided and in these circumstances ground 3 must also be decided adversely to the Applicant.
	


Ground 4

His Honour erred in finding that the effect of the Applicant’s injuries were relevant only to the question of special circumstances, and thus only to the term to be served by way of the non-parole period, rather than relevant also to the head sentence.


	
	Passages set out above from his Honour’s remarks - and they were not qualified by other passages I have omitted - do indicate that his Honour found as the ground asserts. His Honour considered only the difficulty those injuries would occasion to the Applicant while in custody.
	
	
	Undoubtedly the injuries suffered by the Applicant are likely to have a greater impact on him while in custody rather than in any period of his sentence while he is at liberty. However, it cannot be predicated that it will be only during the non-parole period of his sentence that the injuries will so operate. While it may be likely, there is no guarantee that the Applicant will be released immediately once the non-parole period fixed by Toner DCJ expires and no guarantee that his injuries will have no significance during the balance of his sentence. They may, for example, impact on his ability to comply with terms imposed or which might otherwise be imposed as conditions of his parole.
	
	
	Thus his Honour erred in limiting the significance of the Applicant’s injuries as he did.
	


Decision


	
	Although she did not employ the terms of s 6(3) of the Court of Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), counsel appearing for the Crown submitted that, even if any of the Applicant’s grounds of appeal succeeded - and grounds 2 and 4 have - no less severe sentence was warranted.
	
	
	I have summarised the circumstances of the offence. I have said enough to demonstrate that the Applicant’s offence must be described as a determined, sustained and terrifying attempt to kill the victim. When one has regard to Toner DCJ’s finding that the offence was planned and to the number and extent of the injuries inflicted it is inescapable that objectively the offence of wounding with intent to murder was very high on the scale of those contemplated by the relevant statutory provision. Certainly it was well above the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	However, consideration of the Crown’s argument requires some further attention to the circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	He was born in 1979 and had no criminal record. Based on material adduced in evidence, Toner DCJ observed that “these crimes are incongruous to the person described by so many – a generous, loving, honest, reliable man of integrity and gentility”. His Honour observed that the Applicant had suffered violence at the hands of his stepfather and had used illicit drugs but, after reflecting on reports by Dr Westmore, rejected submissions to the effect that these matters had contributed to the offending. His Honour found that the offences were the result of the Applicant being driven by profound jealousy inspired by the break-up of his relationship with the victim.
	
	
	At the commencement of the hearing in this Court, there was tendered and admitted further material to which the Crown had no objection “on the usual basis”. The material included a psychiatric report by Dr Nielssen, the substance of which was that the offence occurred while the Applicant was affected by an hallucinogenic drug, and a report from a psychotherapist, Webber Roberts, who had worked with the Applicant, his sibling, mother and stepfather in and about 1993 and then with Mrs Betts later. The psychotherapist has also interviewed the Applicant on some eight occasions since he was sentenced.
	
	
	In his report Mr Roberts observed that:
	


1.   The impact of domestic violence indicated acute developmental deficits within the interpersonal capacity of Mr Betts and his siblings.

2.   Personality traits of Mr Betts and his siblings, their complex behavioural issues and their coping mechanisms stem from unresolved issues regarding domestic violence during their formative years.


	
	Mr Roberts sought also to provide an explanation of the Applicant’s drug use and observed that at the time of offending the Applicant was “on a collision course of a type of emotional and or [sic] interpersonal crisis given the factors that span the period of his life” and that discussions since the Applicant’s sentence had placed him “in a healthier emotional and mental position to address his re-development through the remainder of his sentence”.
	
	
	Also tendered were certificates of completion of a Domestic Abuse program and participation since his incarceration in a University course, and a number of references attesting to his good character and to the fact that he has made efforts in prison to make the most of his situation. To a very large degree the references reinforce Toner DCJ’s assessment of the Applicant as “a generous, loving, honest, reliable man of integrity and gentility”. They do not take the Applicant’s subjective circumstances further to any significant degree.
	
	
	Insofar as the reports of Dr Nielssen and Mr Roberts seek to canvass the factors causing or contributing to the offence, they are inadmissible. The time of sentence was the appropriate occasion for such matters to be addressed - as they were - and an appeal does not provide an opportunity for a second bite of those issues. Mr Roberts’ opinion that the Applicant has an improved ability to address his re-development is relevant but of limited weight given that Toner DCJ made no findings on this or any similar topic.
	
	
	Was some sentence, other than the one Toner DCJ imposed, warranted in law? I am not persuaded that it was. Despite the subjective features that argue in the Applicant’s favour, the objective features, whether compared against the guidepost of the standard non-parole period or the statutory maximum were so grave that the sentence should not be reduced. In that latter connection it might be noted that, even adding back the discount that the Applicant received for his plea, the non-parole period would be only half of the statutory maximum for wounding with intent and this for an offence that was so bad, it is not easy to imagine one worse.
	
	
	I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

		24 March 2015",2015-03-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2424443,Pak v R [2015] NSWCCA 45,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   On 6 February 2014 the Applicant pleaded guilty to two offences as follows:
	


Count 1: Supply a prohibited drug namely 6.17g of N,N dimethylamphetamine.

Count 2:   Supply a prohibited drug namely 6.48g of amphetamine.


	
	The maximum penalty for each offence was 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Three offences were included on a s 166 Certificate as follows:
	



	
	Possess prohibited drug being 10mg of methadone;
	
	
	Possess prohibited drug being 5.74g of opium; and
	
	
	Drive under the influence of drugs.
	



	
	He was sentenced by Judge Lerve in the District Court on 24 July 2014 as follows:
	


Counts 1 and 2:   On each count a non-parole period of 12 months commencing 22 July 2014 and expiring 21 July 2015 with an additional term of 9 months expiring 21 April 2016.

On each of the two charges of possess a prohibited drug, a fixed term of 2 months commencing 24 July 2014 and expiring 23 September 2014.

In respect of driving under the influence of drugs, a fine of $200 and a disqualification of 12 months.


	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal from the sentence imposed on two grounds:
	


Ground 1:   Lerve DCJ erred in finding Mr Haidari Pak was “involved in trafficking … involved to a substantial degree”;

Ground 2:   The sentences were manifestly excessive.

Facts


	
	The police observed the Applicant driving erratically and required him to stop his vehicle. He complained of back pain. He was disoriented, his eyes were glazed and watery. He was subjected to a road side breath test which returned a negative result.
	
	
	He was asked where he was going but he could not provide a clear answer. The police therefore conducted a search of him and the vehicle. They found four empty packets of Oxycontin. Each had been prescribed by a different doctor within the previous month. They also found ten Physeptone Methadone tablets and a blister pack of four Oxycontin tablets. He was asked about the Physeptone Methadone. He said that he got them from a friend and that he took two tablets day. He refused to name the friend.
	
	
	The Applicant was placed under arrest and cautioned for possession of prohibited drugs. The Applicant was taken to the Auburn Police Station where he was entered into custody.
	
	
	Because of the manner of his driving, his appearance, demeanour and behaviour, he was then taken to Auburn Hospital where blood and urine were obtained. Subsequent testing of his blood and urine revealed the following substances in his blood and urine:
	



	
	(a)   0.004mg/L of Alprazolam;
	
	
	(b)   0.02mg/L of Amphetamine;
	
	
	(c)   0.08mg/L of Methylamphetamine;
	
	
	(d)   0.03mg/l of Oxycodone;
	
	
	(e)   0.04mg/L of Methadone.
	



	
	A search warrant was applied for to search the Applicant’s home address. During the execution of the warrant, the police located and seized:
	


a.   Drug scales, a glass pipe for smoking drugs and a portable gas burner

b.   A blank prescription

c.   Numerous empty resealable plastic bags

d.   A plastic specimen container containing clear crystal rock

e.   1 clear plastic bag containing foil and a smaller clear plastic bag    containing white powder

f.   4 small resealable bags containing clear crystals

g.   1 small resealable bag containing white powder

h. 1 resealable bag with 6 resealable bags containing black liquid    substance.

i.   A small exercise book containing the contact numbers and addresses

   for several doctors along with a page of names, addresses, dates and    quantity of tablets recorded.


	
	All of the above drugs were located in the lounge room in the centre of the floor. The plastic bag containing the drugs was next to two other plastic bags containing numerous packets of medication in the Applicant’s name. The drugs were also next to a gas burner that was lined with foil. There were numerous plastic resealable bags present.
	
	
	Subsequent analysis revealed that the above bags contained:
	


a.   6.48 grams of amphetamine in 7 separate plastic bags or containers

   (Count 2 - Supply Prohibited Drug - 6.48g of amphetamine)

b.   5.74 grams of opium in 6 resealable plastic bags (S166 Offence - Seq

   005 - Possess prohibited drug - 5.74g of opium) and

c.   6.17 grams of N,N-dimethylamphetamine in a resealable plastic bag

   (Count 1 - Supply prohibited drug - 6.17g of N,N-   dimethylamphetamine).


	
	The Applicant was subsequently charged with the offences of supplying prohibited drugs.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	Judge Lerve said that as with any charge in relation to the supply of prohibited drugs, the issue that fell to be determined was whether the Court was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was trafficking to a substantial degree. The Applicant had submitted that, given the small quantity of the drugs, it could be found that the Applicant was involved to a very small degree at street level.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge noted that the quantities of the drug involved were only slightly more than the indictable quantity and about twice the trafficable quantity. His Honour said that if it were merely the quantity of the drugs, he would not be able to find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was involved in trafficking to a substantial degree.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge went on to note, however, the other items that were found which he enumerated as scales, a blank prescription, numerous empty resealable bags, the container containing clear crystal rock, a plastic bag containing foil and a smaller clear plastic bag containing white powder, four resealable bags containing clear crystals, one small resealable bag containing white powder, one resealable bag with six resealable bags containing a black liquid.
	
	
	By reason of those matters his Honour said that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant was involved in an enterprise that envisaged supply on more than one occasion and when those matters were taken into account with the quantity of the drugs, he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant was involved in trafficking to a substantial degree.
	


Subjective factors


	
	No evidence was called by or on behalf of the Applicant and the only information concerning him was obtained from the pre-sentence report.
	
	
	The Applicant was 58 years of age at the time of the offending. The report disclosed that he had migrated to Australia in 2004 after absconding from custody in Iran due to political issues.
	
	
	At the time of the offending he was unemployed and had been since 2004. He was receiving the disability pension, it would seem, because of a disc problem in his lower back.
	
	
	The Applicant lived with his second wife and a son and had a daughter from a previous marriage who resided with her mother.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report referred to a letter from the Applicant’s psychiatrist indicating that the Applicant had been diagnosed with depression, insomnia and anxiety disorder. The Sentencing Judge noted that the letter from the psychiatrist was not put before him at the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	In addition, the Sentencing Judge found that the Applicant had a driving record that entitled him to no particular leniency as far as the offence of driving under the influence of drugs was concerned. There were no offences apart from driving offences on his record.
	


Ground 1:   Finding that the Applicant was involved to a substantial degree in trafficking


	
	The Applicant submitted that, given the quantity of drugs did not prove trafficking to a substantial degree, the other indicia were not of a quality such as to elevate the Applicant’s supplying to that level beyond reasonable doubt. The Applicant submitted that the finding was of significance to the sentencing process because, absent exceptional circumstances, the Sentencing Judge considered himself compelled by authority to impose a sentence of full-time imprisonment.
	
	
	The Applicant noted that the Sentencing Judge ignored the exercise book because that simply recorded the doctors from whom the Applicant obtained prescription drugs. The Applicant submitted that the glass pipe was for personal use and suggested that the scales and the resealable plastic bags may have been for the Applicant’s own use but accepted that they could be used in connection with supply.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that the position in the present matter was similar to that in Youssef v R [2014] NSWCCA 285. In that case the applicant had been stopped by police for the manner of his driving. He was asked if he used illegal drugs and he said “I use cocaine”. Police searched the car and found three small clear plastic bags containing drugs hidden under a plastic cover underneath the handbrake. A further search of the car revealed “a large white rock“ in a clear plastic bag in a compartment in the ceiling of the car. The total weight was 29.86 grams of cocaine. The purity of the larger amount was analysed to be 54%. The purity of the three smaller bags was not tested.
	
	
	The applicant in that case asserted that he had the drugs for the purposes of a party the following evening. McCallum J (with whom Simpson and Price JJ agreed) held at [29] and [33] that it was not open to the sentencing judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was substantially involved in supply.
	
	
	It does not seem to me that Youssef assists the present Applicant. A determination of whether an offender is substantially involved in supply is ultimately a question of fact in each case. The Applicant would need to demonstrate, as he accepted, that the finding beyond reasonable doubt was not open to the Sentencing Judge.
	
	
	The amount of cocaine in Youssef may have exceeded the amounts of the drugs in the present case but there were no other indicia of supply as there are in the present case. Although the Sentencing Judge said that if he were only concerned with the quantity of the drugs he would not be able to make the finding beyond reasonable doubt, here there were three different drugs and a number of indicia of supply. It cannot be said, in those circumstances, that the finding was not open to his Honour.
	
	
	It is not sufficient that this Court might have come to a different conclusion or have made a different finding in that regard. The matter was one for the Sentencing Judge and it has not been shown that he has gone about his task in any erroneous way. Indeed, there was ample basis for the conclusion he reached for the reasons he gave.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 2:   The sentences are manifestly excessive


	
	The Applicant in his written submissions argued that, apart from the finding that the Applicant was trafficking to a substantial degree, the Sentencing Judge did not make an express finding about the objective seriousness of the offences. He submitted that the quantities of drugs were small, being about twice the trafficable quantity and just over the indictable quantity. The evidence was said to suggest a low-level, unsophisticated supply with no evidence of actual supply. There should have been a finding, it was submitted, of low objective seriousness.
	
	
	The Applicant pointed also to the subjective matters which have been mentioned earlier. The Applicant submitted that when the objective seriousness and the subjective factors were taken into account, the sentences should have been towards the bottom of the range but were not.
	
	
	The Applicant, although noting this Court’s repeated warning about statistics, submitted that the statistics showed that of all offenders only 53% were sentenced to full-time imprisonment. For those the head sentences ranged between about 6 months and five to six years with the mid-point being at about two years. The non-parole period ranged between about six months and three years six months, with the mid-point at about 12 months.
	
	
	The Applicant said that the statistics showed further that for offenders like the Applicant who had no prior criminal history and pleaded guilty only 29% were sentenced to full-time imprisonment with head sentences ranging between 12 months and four years six months to six years with the mid-point at about two years. The non-parole periods ranged between six months and two years six months with a mid-point at about 12 months. About 30% in each group were said to have received suspended sentences.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge accorded a discount of 12.5% for the utilitarian value of a plea shortly before the trial was listed to start. That meant that the starting point for the sentences imposed was a sentence of two years imprisonment.
	
	
	His Honour made the sentences entirely concurrent and found special circumstances to a significant degree with the non-parole period representing approximately 57% of the total sentence. The two drug offences on the s 166 Certificate were made entirely concurrent.
	
	
	His Honour had almost no subjective material on the part of the Applicant, no evidence of remorse apart from the plea nor any evidence suggesting good prospects of rehabilitation or that he was unlikely to reoffend.
	
	
	In Kendall v R [2015] NSWCCA 13 Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Johnson and Hamill JJ agreed) said:
	


[47]   As has been often stated by this Court “to establish that a sentence is manifestly excessive an applicant has to demonstrate that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”. This has to be established in a context where there is no single correct sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle. Most pertinently the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it may have exercised its discretion in a manner different from that of the sentencing judge.” (Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33].)


	
	Although the Sentencing Judge did not make a finding of objective seriousness, the starting point for the sentences imposed when viewed against the maximum penalty and even the sentences relied upon from the statistics, suggests that his Honour considered the offending was at a relatively low level of seriousness. However, the finding that the Applicant was substantially involved in supply meant that, unless there were exceptional circumstances, a fulltime custodial sentence would ordinarily be imposed: R v Gu [2006] NSWCCA 104 at [27].
	
	
	When all of the sentences for drug offences were to be served concurrently and where there was a substantial reduction in the non-parole period, it cannot be said that the sentences imposed are reflective of any error of a House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 type. The sentence both as to its non-parole period and total sentence is consistent with the ranges that the statistics disclose. I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal granted.

(2)   Appeal dismissed.


	
	BELLEW J:   I agree with Davies J.

		27 March 2015",2015-03-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2424448,Lowe v R [2015] NSWCCA 46,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA:   I have had the advantage of reading in draft the comprehensive reasons of Davies J, with which I agree. I also agree with the additional observations of Simpson J.
	
	
	SIMPSON J:    I have read in draft the judgment of Davies J, with which I agree. I wish only to add the following brief observations.
	
	
	The jurisdictional issue that arises is one of statutory construction. Section 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) expressly permits appeals as of right in some cases (appeals against conviction on grounds involving questions of law alone); it permits appeals only by leave in other cases (appeals against conviction involving questions of fact alone or questions of mixed law and fact, and against sentence). Section 5 draws a clear distinction between the two procedures. It is therefore convenient to set out the terms of the s 5(1):
	


""5 Right of appeal in criminal cases

(1)   A person convicted on indictment may appeal under this Act to the court:

(a) against the person's conviction on any ground which involves a question of law alone, and

(b) with the leave of the court, or upon the certificate of the judge of the court of trial that it is a fit case for appeal against the person's conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone, or question of mixed law and fact, or any other ground which appears to the court to be a sufficient ground of appeal, and

(c) with the leave of the court against the sentence passed on the person's conviction.""


	
	The language of s 5 makes it plain, in my opinion, that unless the appeal is against conviction on a question of law alone, there is no appeal unless leave is granted. That is important, because s 6, which is headed ""Determination of appeals in ordinary cases"" sets out the various orders the court may make following an appeal. It says nothing of the orders that may be made following the hearing of an application for leave to appeal. It is implicit that such leave may either be granted or refused. It is only when leave has been granted that s 6 comes into play.
	
	
	""Appeal"" is not defined in the Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	Nothing in s 6 (or elsewhere in the Criminal Appeal Act) indicates that refusal of an application for leave to appeal is equivalent to dismissal of an appeal. It is not.
	
	
	The grant (or refusal) of leave to appeal is a discretionary decision. Refusal of leave to appeal does not create a jurisdictional bar to any further proceedings. If it be the case that a second (or subsequent) application for leave to appeal raises issues that have been determined on the merits in a previous application, that provides a powerful basis for the exercise of the discretion against a grant of leave. This, no doubt, is what Duggan J had in mind in R v Spiero [2001] SASC 19; 78 SASR 531 (for more detail, see the judgment of Davies J at [101] and [102], in the latter of which the relevant passage is extracted).
	
	
	It must be assumed that there was a reason that the legislature drew the distinction between appeals as of right, and applications for leave to appeal. They are different procedures, and have different consequences.
	
	
	That, in my opinion, is sufficient to dispose of the jurisdictional issue. However, the conclusion is supported by authority, to which I need refer only briefly, since it is fully dealt with in the judgment of Davies J.
	
	
	The high point of the argument advanced on behalf of the respondent is a single passage in the judgment of Dixon J in Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; 60 CLR 431. As Davies J has pointed out, no issue of a subsequent application for leave to appeal arose in Grierson. Grierson was concerned with an attempt to launch a second appeal, after dismissal of the first appeal. The passage in the judgment of Dixon J on which the respondent relies is:
	


""The court [the Court of Criminal Appeal] refused an application on the part of the prisoner to reopen an appeal which he had brought unsuccessfully from his conviction or to give him leave to bring a fresh appeal …

The Supreme Court held, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of South Australia (R v Edwards (No 2) [1931] SASR 376) that a second appeal from a conviction could not be entertained after the dismissal, upon the merits, of an appeal or application for leave to appeal, and that the first appeal could not be re-opened after a final determination."" (italics added)


	
	In fact, the decision in Edwards included the following:
	


""There is no express power to entertain a second appeal, or to hear a second application for leave to appeal, and there is no precedent in either case for its being done. There can be no doubt that the Court has power to entertain a second application for leave to appeal, at any rate, where it has not heard the merits of the application.""


	
	The observation of Dixon J, in my opinion, (and with respect to Callaway JA, who in The Queen v GAM (No 2) [2004] VSCA 117; 9 VR 640 declined so to declare), is obiter.
	
	
	The remark of Dixon J has been superseded by the more recent and pertinent decision of the High Court in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 (see the judgment of Davies J at [77]) in dicta to which three judges (Dawson, Gaudron and Kirby JJ) subscribed. Their Honours anticipated precisely the situation that has here arisen, as did this Court in R v Stead [1999] NSWCCA 41.
	
	
	In my opinion, refusal of an application for leave to appeal is not a jurisdictional bar to a subsequent application, although, depending on the circumstances, the disposition of the first application might constitute a discretionary bar.
	
	
	I agree with the detailed reasons and analysis of Davies J in coming to the same conclusion, and I agree with his proposed disposition of the application, for the reasons given by him.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   The Applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 25 February 2009 to the following charges:
	


CAN Sequence 16:   Ongoing supply of prohibited drug (Methylamphetamine);

CAN Sequence 5:   Supplying a prohibited drug (443.8g methylamphetamine) being not less than the commercial quantity.


	
	Each of those offences carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The charge of supplying a prohibited drug not less than the commercial quantity has a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	On 22 May 2009 the Applicant pleaded guilty at Campbelltown District Court to the following five counts on an indictment:
	


Count 1:   Supply a prohibited drug (479.6g methylamphetamine) being not less than the commercial quantity. The maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment with a 10 year SNPP;

Count 2:   Cultivate a prohibited plant by enhanced indoor means for a commercial purpose. The maximum penalty is 15 years imprisonment;

Count 3:   Possess an unauthorised firearm. The maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment with a 3 year SNPP;

Count 4:   Possess an unregistered firearm. The maximum penalty is five years imprisonment;

Count 5:   Possess a prohibited weapon without a permit. The maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment with a 3 year SNPP.


	
	On 23 October 2009 he was sentenced by Judge Conlon as follows:
	


Count 3:   Fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years and 4 months commencing 4 July 2008 and expiring on 3 November 2010;

Count 4:   Fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months commencing 4 July 2008 and expiring on 3 July 2009;

Count 5 (and taking into account the first Form 1): Fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years commencing 4 July 2008 and expiring on 3 July 2011;

Count 2:   Fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years commencing 4 July 2008 and expiring on 3 July 2011;

Count 1:   A non-parole period of 7 years commencing 4 July 2008 and expiring on 3 July 2015 with an additional term of 3 years to expire on 3 July 2018.

CAN Sequence 16 (and taking into account the second Form 1): A non-parole period of 7 years commencing 4 July 2009 and expiring on 3 July 2016 with an additional term of 3 years to expire on 3 July 2019.

CAN Sequence 5:   A non-parole period of 8 years commencing from 4 July 2010 and expiring on 3 July 2018 with an additional term of 4 years to expire on 3 July 2022.


	
	The total effective non-parole period was 10 years commencing 4 July 2008 and expiring on 3 July 2018 with an additional term of 4 years expiring on 3 July 2022.
	
	
	The first Form 1 contained the following offences:
	


(a)   Possess firearm with altered/defaced identification mark (maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment);

(b)   Possess prohibited weapon without permit (maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment - SNPP 3 years);

(c)   Four counts of possessing ammunition (maximum penalty 50 penalty units);

(d)   Possess unregistered firearm (maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment);

(e)   Two counts of not keeping a firearm safely (being the unregistered firearm and the firearm with the altered/defaced identification mark) (maximum penalty 12 months imprisonment).


	
	The second Form 1 consisted of two counts as follows:
	


(a)   Supply prohibited drug being 1650.4g of cannabis leaf (maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment);

(b)   Goods in custody being $30,335 (maximum penalty 6 months imprisonment and/or 5 penalty units).


	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal on one ground only:
	


The sentence imposed on the applicant when compared with the sentence imposed on the co-offender Sinkovich, is such as to leave Lowe with a legitimate sense of grievance.


	
	The Applicant has already sought leave unsuccessfully to appeal to this Court: Lowe v R [2013] NSWCCA 141. It is necessary, therefore, to set out in some detail how this present application for leave to appeal arises.
	


The facts


	
	The following is the summary of the agreed facts by the Sentencing Judge:
	


Ongoing supply (methylamphetamine) - s 25A (CAN Sequence 16)


	
	In May 2008 Operation Fiesta was formed to investigate the supply of methylamphetamine in the Minto and Claymore area. As part of this a controlled operation was authorised on 5 June 2008.
	
	
	On 12 June 2008 a police undercover operative (""UCO"") known as ""Peter"" attended Swettenham Road, Minto carrying $2,700 in cash. He wore a listening device. The Applicant was driven to this location by the co-offender Frank Sinkovich. Whilst Sinkovich waited by the car the Applicant went to the undercover operative's vehicle and supplied him with one ounce (31.8 grams gross weight) of methylamphetamine in exchange for the $2,700. That was later analysed and weighed showing a net total weight of 27.2 grams.
	
	
	There was then conversation about a further supply. In this conversation the Applicant referred to ""Jack"" (co-offender Tutton) as a person who would chase money for him and that the UCO would meet him in the next week. The Applicant told the UCO that Jack was ""like my uncle...'cause my father's who we work for in this"". The Applicant told the UCO to bring an Esky or cooler next time to keep the methylamphetamine from drying out. The Applicant also gave the UCO a mobile number for future contact.
	
	
	On 18 June 2008 the UCO called the Applicant to arrange the purchase of two ounces. He was told the price would be ""five four"".
	
	
	On 20 June 2008 the UCO again drove to the Swettenham Road location and met with both the Applicant and Tutton. They supplied the UCO with 65.7 grams of methylamphetamine for $5,400. Later weighing indicated a net total weight of 53.3 grams.
	
	
	Discussion then took place about the possible future purchase of ""an elbow"". The UCO asked for a rough price. The Applicant said it would be about ""thirty"". Tutton stated that several weeks ago the prices were running between ""thirty and thirty-five"".
	
	
	Arrangements were later made for another meeting on 26 June 2008. On that day the UCO attended the same location. He called the Applicant's mobile phone and was told that he had organised for Tutton to attend. A short time later Tutton arrived and supplied the UCO with three ounces (98.5 grams) of methylamphetamine for $8,100. Later weighed it showed a net total weight of 81.8 grams. Discussion then turned to the price of an elbow. Tutton said he thought it would be ""thirty-two"". They agreed no one other than the Applicant and Tutton would attend for the big deal and that the money would be counted in the car.
	
	
	On 30 June 2008 the Applicant spoke to the UCO over the phone. The UCO told him that the deal could probably be organised early next week. Shortly after that conversation the Applicant called Sinkovich and asked if he could postpone the delivery for another week. Sinkovich said he would ""get it anyway as it didn't matter"". The Applicant said ""Okay but he said ""definitely next week”.
	
	
	On 2 July 2008 the UCO again attended Swettenham Road and met with the Applicant and Tutton. They supplied 66 grams of methylamphetamine for $5,400. The net weight indicated 53.9 grams. The Applicant then told the UCO that ""that thing"" (the elbow) was getting delivered to his house that day. He said, ""The boss has dropped it off at my house"". On 3 July 2008 the meeting in respect of the elbow was confirmed for 12 noon on 4 July 2008.
	


Supply prohibited drug (methylamphetamine), being not less than the commercial quantity 4 July 2008 (CAN Sequence 5)


	
	On 4 July 2008 the UCO met with the Applicant and Tutton just before midday at Swettenham Road for the supply of one pound (16 ounces) of methylamphetamine for $32,000. They entered the UCO's car with the Applicant in the front passenger seat and Tutton in the rear. The Applicant removed three packages from a backpack. Tutton passed him an Esky from which the Applicant removed an ice-pack to keep the drugs cool. The total gross weight supplied to the UCO during this transaction was 512.8 grams. It was later analysed and weighed showing a net total weight of 443.8 grams. The UCO then handed over the money to the Applicant and as he began to count it other police officers moved in and all were arrested. The drugs were seized, as was the $32,000 in cash. The Applicant and Tutton were then taken back to the Macquarie Fields Police Station where they declined to be interviewed.
	


Count one:   Supply prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) being not less than the commercial quantity - 4 July 2008.


	
	At 12.20pm on that same day being 4 July 2008 search warrants were executed at premises at 11 Bernardo Street, Rosemeadow and 12 Longstaff Way, Claymore. The Applicant had been leasing the Bernardo Street address from his sister Samantha Edmonds. When the search warrant was executed Sinkovich was sitting on the lounge watching ""Underbelly"" on television. Sinkovich told the police that the house was not his but he had stayed there overnight. Police noticed that the bonnet of his car was still hot.
	
	
	In a freezer in the kitchen police located a large resealable bag containing 18.4 grams (net) and two resealable bags containing 6.5 grams (net) of the same drug (methylamphetamine). In the laundry freezer they found a pink plastic case containing 395.7 grams (net); a specimen jar with 31.7 grams (net) of methylamphetamine; one resealable plastic bag containing 26.6 grams (net); eighteen small resealable plastic bags containing white residue (0.7 grams of methylamphetamine). All items were later analysed and found to be methylamphetamine and the net total weight was 479.6 grams.
	


Count two:   Cultivate prohibited plant


	
	During a search of the premises at 11 Bernardo Street police found in a room within the house eighteen cannabis plants grown by enhanced indoor means.
	


Counts three, four and five - possess unauthorised prohibited firearm, possess unregistered firearm, and possess a prohibited weapon without a permit


	
	During a search of the main bedroom police located in the wardrobe one .22 calibre Phoenix self-loading pistol with ID erased (the first matter on the Form 1 relating to Count 5) with two magazines in bubble wrap (count three). They also found a .22 calibre BSA Sportsman single shot rifle JB31077, (count four) and two Taser-like devices (count five).
	
	
	The eight further matters on that Form 1 related to other firearms and ammunition located within the premises at 11 Bernardo Street on that same day.
	
	
	The two further matters on the other Form 1 (relating to CAN Sequence 16) are in respect of $30,335 in cash found within those premises and 1,650.4 grams of packaged and loose cannabis leaf found in the same room where the cannabis plants were growing.
	


Subjective factors


	
	The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing so that the detail of his background and circumstances came from reports which were tendered and from his sister who gave evidence. The Sentencing Judge summarised the Applicant's subjective circumstances as follows.
	
	
	The Applicant was 37 years of age when sentenced and is now aged 41. While his criminal record was not an extensive one, and he had no prior drug related matters, it was nevertheless not one that would entitle him to leniency.
	
	
	The Applicant was the eldest of four children. He was apparently raised in a caring and supportive family environment and there were no significant issues during his childhood. He had always been protective of his three sisters and when his parents were called upon to work long hours the Applicant felt he had a responsibility to care for them.
	
	
	He completed year ten at high school, achieving average results. After leaving the school he completed 12 months of a carpentry apprenticeship. He then worked building air conditioners for three months before commencing and completing a four year motor mechanics apprenticeship. He remained employed in that field for a further four years. Since that time he had been variously employed as a storeman, a truck driver, and most recently between 2005 and 2007 he had conducted his own landscaping/home maintenance business.
	
	
	He informed the probation officer that he used cannabis between the ages of 14 and 24, and would use amphetamines and ecstasy on weekends approximately once a month throughout his life. However, he maintained that his use of illicit drugs was not a factor in respect of the commission of the present offences.
	
	
	He commenced a 14 year relationship when he was about 20 years of age and he had three children then aged 17, 11 and 10 from that relationship. He said he went through a difficult separation with his ex-partner around Christmas 2006. However, he remained on friendly terms with her and had been assisting with the care of his children while she studied full time at TAFE from about mid 2007 until he was arrested in respect of the present offences. Since his incarceration that relationship had become strained and his ex-partner refused to allow him any contact with his children. It seems that the Applicant did not want his children seeing him in a custodial environment. The Applicant also informed the probation officer that he entered a new relationship about six months prior to his arrest but that relationship had also ended. He apparently remained unemployed since about 2007 and was not in receipt of Centrelink benefits.
	
	
	He advised the probation officer that he was a member of the Rebels Outlaws motorcycle gang, joining in 1999. He was the sergeant at arms of the Wollongong chapter between 2004 and 2006 and was the secretary of the chapter from 2006 up until his arrest in July 2008. He adamantly denied that this association was a factor in the commission of the present offences.
	
	
	The Applicant's parents and sisters all resided in Queensland. His mother indicated that whilst the family was disappointed about his involvement in the offences the family would continue to support him.
	
	
	Ms Crystal Slack, the Applicant's sister, confirmed that the Applicant had indeed provided much comfort and support to all of his sisters both growing up and in their adult lives. She said he was a person that was always there for them.
	
	
	In both the pre-sentence report and the report of the psychologist, Mr Anthony Diment the Applicant sought to provide a reason for his involvement in these offences. To the probation officer he indicated in part, that a friend owed a large drug debt, that he (the Applicant) had agreed to be that person's bodyguard/security and that he was attempting to assist his friend work off that drug debt by supplying drugs. A similar explanation appeared in the psychologist's report. In accordance with the principle in R v Quatami [2001] NSWCCA 353; (2001) 127 A Crim R 369 at [58]-[59] the Sentencing Judge correctly placed little weight on those untested assertions.
	
	
	In his report Mr Diment stated that the Applicant was suffering from anxiety and depression. He said:
	


While some of this is reasonably due to his current circumstances and pre-sentence, he is genuinely concerned about his children and family's welfare. He appears to have had a tough upbringing and he has always considered himself responsible for protecting his family. A role which he takes seriously.


	
	The Applicant informed the psychologist that he regretted his actions:
	


big time, like you wouldn't believe...now will not be involved in anything like this that is in my power to do so...upset over the implications for others, not just me...family, kids...issues of drugs and all that for those into that rubbish.


	
	Mr Diment stated:
	


In regards to his favourable prognosis and rehabilitation prospects, in his favour is a basically well-adjusted ""core"" personality and he has a good work ethic. His main passion in life involves cars and motorbikes and he told me that people in his motorcycle club 'Are on my back big time about my stupidity in all this...I reckon I have learned the hard way...I won't get another chance from them.


	
	The Sentencing Judge said that this statement might qualify for an expression of regret but it could not be put any higher than that.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge said that the fact that at 37 years of age the Applicant did not have any extensive criminal record and that he had had a continuous working history gave him some hope that the Applicant had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.
	


Co-offender Frank Sinkovich


	
	Sinkovich pleaded not guilty. On 6 July 2009 following a trial, the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of two counts as follows:
	


Count 1:   On 12 June 2008 knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine;

Count 2:   That between 29 June 2008 and 5 July 2008 he did supply a prohibited drug being not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine.


	
	Count 2 concerned the same transaction charged as CAN Sequence 5 against the Applicant. Count 1 was concerned with the same acts as constituted the on-going supply against the Applicant (CAN Sequence 16). Count 1 is relevant because it is necessary to consider the total effective sentences imposed on each of the Applicant and Sinkovich.
	
	
	Judge Conlon sentenced Sinkovich on 6 November 2009 as follows:
	


Count 1:   A non-parole period of two years commencing 4 July 2008 and expiring 3 July 2010 with an additional term of two years to expire 3 July 2012;

Count 2:   A non-parole period of nine years commencing 4 July 2009 and expiring 3 July 2018 with an additional term of 4 years expiring 3 July 2022.


	
	The total effective sentence was a non-parole period of 10 years with a balance of term of 4 years.
	
	
	An appeal to this Court by Sinkovich was unsuccessful: Sinkovich v R [2011] NSWCCA 90. In that appeal Sinkovich argued a parity ground based on the sentence the Applicant received in respect of CAN Sequence 5 and argued that the sentences were manifestly excessive.
	
	
	There was nothing in particular in Sinkovich's subjective circumstances to distinguish him from the Applicant apart from the fact that he was aged 54 at the time of sentence. He had only a minor criminal record. The Sentencing Judge thought that he had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. However, he showed no remorse, maintaining his innocence in the face of what the Sentencing Judge described as an overwhelming prosecution case. Like the Applicant he belonged to the Wollongong Chapter of the Rebels Motorcycle Club, having previously been its president.
	
	
	When sentencing the Applicant in relation to the supply of not less than the commercial quantity of the prohibited drug the Sentencing Judge said that it involved a considerable degree of planning being negotiations in respect of price and the timeframe when delivery could be made. It involved the Applicant contacting Sinkovich who would organise for the collection of the commercial quantity and bring it to a location where the Applicant could collect it and then on supply it to the UCO. His Honour assessed the objective seriousness as far as the Applicant was concerned as falling above the mid range but not at the upper end of the range.
	
	
	When sentencing Sinkovich for the same offence his Honour again said that it indicated a considerable degree of planning involving negotiations in respect of the price and the timeframe for delivery. He said Sinkovich was the ""go to"" man for the supply and it involved Sinkovich organising for the supply and collection of the drug and then organising its supply to the Applicant so he could on supply it to the UCO. This involved a driver being organised to take the Applicant and the co-offender Tutton to the Swettenham Road location. Sinkovich then waited at the Applicant's premises while the transaction was taking place.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge assessed Sinkovich as being slightly above the Applicant in the hierarchy. He assessed the objective seriousness of the offence as far as Sinkovich was concerned as falling slightly above the mid- range.
	
	
	The judgment of this Court in the appeal by Sinkovich was given on 15 April 2011. The application for leave to appeal by the present Applicant came before this Court on 22 April 2013. The orders made by this Court in the Applicant’s appeal were:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal refused.

(2)   Dismiss the appeal by the Crown.

The Crown had brought an appeal on a contingent basis that the sentences, if reduced for parity reasons or otherwise, would be manifestly inadequate.


	
	The conclusion of this Court in relation to the ground of appeal by the Applicant based on parity was as follows:
	


[73]   In my opinion, viewed overall, the findings of objective seriousness in relation to the same offence charged against each of the Applicant and Sinkovich are relatively equal and the distinction the Sentencing Judge made that Sinkovich was slightly above the Applicant in the hierarchy would of itself require no different sentence to be given to each of the offenders. There was no real difference in their subjective circumstances and the difference in relation to any remorse was minimal particularly bearing in mind that the Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing.

[74]   The significant matter is that, all other things being relatively equal, the notional starting point for the Applicant was three years above that of Sinkovich. Although the two offenders were sentenced by the same judge only weeks apart and the judge made reference to their comparative roles in the offence no reasons are provided by the judge for the difference in the starting point in the sentences. The difference was not insignificant (23%) and it had the effect of denying to the Applicant almost the entirety of the discount he was otherwise given for an early plea.

[75]   Whilst the difference in their roles as found by the judge was such that the same sentence for each would not have resulted in a justifiable sense of grievance on the Applicant's part, the imposition of a higher sentence to the extent of three years (before the discount for the early plea) on the Applicant with the lesser role and in the absence of other aggravating factors results in a justifiable sense of grievance.

[76]   This ground is made out. Nothing in the evidence suggests otherwise than that the notional starting point for each offender should be the same. Subject to other matters which I shall mention later, with a discount of 25% for the early plea, and maintaining the ratio employed by the Sentencing Judge the Applicant should be sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months with an additional term of 3 years and 3 months.


	
	Notwithstanding that determination the Applicant was unsuccessful. The reasons of this Court were as follows:
	


[89]   If time was extended in the present case the result would be that it would be necessary to re-sentence the Applicant because of his success in relation to Ground 1 based on parity. It would then be necessary to consider the Crown’s appeal which would involve a consideration of the proposed new sentence in respect of CAN Sequence 5 (referred to in paragraph [76] above.

[90]   In my opinion the matter can be approached this way. If the Applicant was to be re-sentenced for CAN Sequence 5 it would then be necessary to consider principles of concurrency, accumulation and totality: Shortland v R at [147]. A consideration of those matters leads me to the conclusion that, from the perspective of totality, an effective sentence for all matters is precisely the effective overall sentence which was imposed.

[91]   The overall sentence covered three serious drug supply offences and a number of serious firearm offences before the lesser offences are considered. The co-offender Sinkovich was charged and sentenced as set out in paragraphs [59] to [62] above for the two offences referred to, one of which (Count 2) was identical to CAN Sequence 5 charged against the Applicant and the other of which arose out of the same facts as CAN Sequence 16 charged against the Applicant.

[92]   He appealed to this Court, arguing that the sentences were manifestly excessive. This Court dismissed the appeal saying:

[62]   It follows that the sentence passed, both in total and in relation to the individual offences, was well open to his Honour and albeit towards the top of the range of sentences for offences of this kind, was well within the range of the permissible exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. Error has not been demonstrated. Accordingly, grounds of appeal 1 and 2 have not been made out. (emphasis added)

[93]   Any overall sentence less than the Sentencing Judge imposed upon the Applicant would not be warranted. This is not to enter upon the debate concerning whether s 6(3) refers only to individual sentences or extends to the totality of sentences imposed upon an appellant (see the differing views in Arnaout v R [2008] NSWCCA 278; (2008) 191 A Crim R 149). It is simply to recognise that regard must be had to the total effective sentence to see that it represents a proper period of incarceration for the totality of the criminality involved: R v AEM Snr [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [70].

[94]   There is power by virtue of s 7(1) and/or (1A) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to have regard to the overall sentence imposed and to correct anomalies that may result from the alteration to one particular sentence: Ryan v The Queen (1982) 149 CLR 1 at 22-23 and 25; R H McL v R [2000] HCA 46; (2000) 203 CLR 452 at [32]-[33]. So, in R v Knight [2005] NSWCCA 253; (2005) 155 A Crim R 252 Johnson J (with whom Mason P & Barr J agreed) restructured a large number of sentences to comply with proper sentencing principles resulting in the same overall sentence and the same non-parole period that had been imposed by the judge at first instance.

[95]   If this Court was to re-sentence the Applicant the sentences would be structured in a manner that would adjust the concurrency and accumulation to produce the same overall sentence. In those circumstances, although the Applicant has demonstrated error in regard to parity in respect of CAN Sequence 5 there is ultimately no merit in the appeal. …


	
	The appeal of Sinkovich was unsuccessful principally because the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the Sentencing Judge’s approach to the sentence based upon R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. The judgment of this Court predated the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.
	
	
	That led Sinkovich to make application under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). That application was dealt with by Latham J in Application by Frank Sinkovich pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2013] NSWSC 1342. Although her Honour found that the reasoning of both the Sentencing Judge and this Court was infected by the error identified in Muldrock, her Honour held that on a proper construction of s 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act that section did not permit consideration based upon the Muldrock error.
	
	
	Sinkovich then brought judicial review proceedings in the Court of Appeal seeking a review of Latham J’s decision. The Court of Appeal upheld the application and made a declaration in these terms:
	


Declare that an error of law on the part of the sentencing judge and, on appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal, which may have caused a sentence to be imposed of greater severity that would otherwise have been the case, constitutes an aspect of the proceedings giving rise to the sentence which may form the basis of a doubt or question as to circumstances having the potential to mitigate the sentence imposed, for the purpose of considering an application for an inquiry under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.

Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383; (2013) 85 NSWLR 783.


	
	The matter must have been reconsidered by Latham J who on 18 December 2013 apparently made a referral to this Court pursuant to s 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act: see Sinkovich v R [2014] NSWCCA 97 at [7].
	
	
	On that referral the sole ground of appeal was:
	


The sentencing judge erred in the application of the standard non-parole period legislation in light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120 with respect to count 2.


	
	The Crown conceded that the ground should be upheld. The issue for this Court was whether a lesser sentence was warranted under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). This Court resolved to resentence. It maintained the sentence imposed for Count 1 but quashed the sentence imposed for Count 2. In lieu, this Court sentenced the appellant in respect of Count 2 to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 3 years and 6 months. The sentence was to date from 4 July 2009 with the appellant becoming eligible for release on parole on 3 January 2017 and the total term expiring on 3 July 2020.
	
	
	It is as a result of that new sentence imposed on Sinkovich that the present application has been made.
	


Jurisdiction


	
	In circumstances where the present Applicant has already applied unsuccessfully to this Court to vary his sentences, a preliminary issue arises whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain this present application. The Applicant accepts that if this Court in Lowe v R [2013] NSWCCA 141 had made an order dismissing the appeal there would be no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. However, the order made by this Court was relevantly that the application for leave to appeal should be refused. The Applicant submits that in those circumstances this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.
	
	
	The Applicant relies on what Dawson and Gaudron JJ said in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 305:
	


Ordinarily, it is of no consequence whether an order is made dismissing an application for leave to appeal or whether leave is granted and the appeal dismissed. However, putting aside applications which are frivolous or vexatious, there is no reason in principle to prevent a person bringing a second application for leave to appeal if an earlier application has been dismissed. An application based on matters agitated on a previous application is properly to be regarded as frivolous or vexatious. But that is not the case where an application is based on a sentencing disparity which has subsequently emerged. That is always a possibility in a case of this kind. That being so, the interests of justice require that, if an application for leave against sentence is to be heard and determined against an applicant before a co-accused is brought to trial, leave be refused, rather than that the appeal be dismissed.

These remarks were agreed by Kirby J (at 333).  


	
	The Crown submitted that the Applicant’s argument in that regard had been considered and rejected in R v G.A.M. (No. 2) [2004] VSCA 117; (2004) 9 VR 640. In that case the Applicant had earlier been refused leave to appeal against his conviction on various sexual offences but had been granted leave to appeal against the sentence. Subsequently the complainant swore a statutory declaration to the effect that all the allegations of sexual abuse that she had made were false. Thereafter the Applicant sought an extension of time within which to make a second application for leave to appeal against conviction.
	
	
	In that case Winneke P (with whom Callaway JA (in a separate judgment) and Eames JA agreed) said:
	


[25]   Many of the authorities to which I have referred were applied by this Court in its decision in R. v. McNamara [No.2]. In my view, and subject to what appears hereunder, they result in the conclusion that this Court has no power to reopen either an application for leave to appeal or an appeal (whether against conviction or sentence) which has been determined on the merits on the grounds of fresh evidence.

[26]   The principle established in Grierson's case has consistently been followed in those States of Australia whose statutory appellate procedures derive from the English Act of 1907. Thus, in Victoria, the principles have been applied in McNamara [No.2] and also in R. v. De Jonk; in Western Australia in R.v. Stone; and Vella; in New South Wales in Saxon; and in South Australia in Caruso. These decisions appear to recognize the principle that once an appeal or application for leave to appeal against conviction or sentence has been dismissed and the decision of the Court of Appeal has passed into record, a further appeal or application, based on fresh evidence, cannot be entertained by the Court which is, by then, functus officio. The principle takes its colour from the statutory appellate process contained in Part VI of the Crimes Act including as it does, the prerogative process contained in s.584. The substance of that statutory process does not take its colour from common law principles nor from principles which govern appellate processes in the civil arena. Thus, once the application for leave or the appeal has been decided on its merits and has passed into record, it cannot be reopened. Whether the appeal is ""an appeal"" as of right or one for which leave is required does not matter.

…

[34]   In the light of the review which I have made of the authorities in England and in this country, I do not accept the submission of counsel for the applicant that such authorities bind this Court to draw a distinction between the power of an appellate court to re-open a criminal appeal which has been dismissed on the merits and an application for leave which has been refused after argument upon the merits. Counsel has relied, for the existence of such a distinction, upon the various judgments delivered in Postiglione (supra), particularly the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron, JJ. where their Honours state that there is ""no reason in principle to prevent a person bringing a second application for leave to appeal if an earlier application has been dismissed"". However, neither McHugh, J. nor Gummow, J. expressed any view supporting the validity of such a distinction; and Kirby, J. expressed the view that, in circumstances where the sentencing of the co-offender remains outstanding, it may ""well be sensible to adopt the expedient proposed by Dawson and Gaudron, JJ. in their reasons"". (my emphasis). However, his Honour further stated that he was prepared to assume that there was, in the case at hand, ""no jurisdictional barrier to the appellant's second application"". His Honour did not find it necessary to refer to Grierson v. The King.

[35]   In the light of the peculiar circumstances which existed in Postiglione, and the various reasons given by the Judges to resolve them, I cannot accept the submission of the applicant's counsel that the decision binds this Court to conclude (contrary to Grierson v. R.) that an application for leave to appeal against conviction which has been dismissed or refused on its merits can be re-opened on the basis of ""fresh evidence""; but that an appeal against conviction, which has been dismissed on the merits, cannot. That would truly be ""an expedient"" because it would wholly depend upon the words used by the appellate court in disposing of the application. I should also add that, as a matter of practice in this State, petitions for mercy (generally on the basis of ""fresh evidence"") are - and have been - presented to the Executive pursuant to s.584 Crimes Act following the conviction and sentence of persons charged with indictable offences; and the dismissal or refusal thereafter (on the merits) of their applications for leave to appeal. (citations omitted)


	
	The two starting-points for a consideration of this issue are R v Edwards (No. 2) [1931] SASR 376 and R v Grierson (1937) 54 WN (NSW) 144.
	
	
	In Edwards the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal heard an appeal against conviction on matters of law, an application for leave to appeal against conviction on matters of fact and an application for leave to appeal against sentence. The appeal was dismissed and the applications for leave were refused. The offender later sought an extension of time for an appeal and a further application for leave to appeal against his conviction on the basis of fresh evidence.
	
	
	The Court said (at 378 – 380):
	


This Court in its criminal appellate jurisdiction is a statutory Court. An appeal lies to it on any of the grounds mentioned in sec.5 above quoted. The right of the appellant, under this section, to appeal, has been exercised. There is no express power to entertain a second appeal, or to hear a second application for leave to appeal, and there is no precedent in either case for its being done. There can be no doubt that the Court has power to entertain a second application for leave to appeal, at any rate, where it has not heard the merits of the application.

…

On the language of the Act and applying the principle of the decisions on the civil side, which have been quoted, we think we have no jurisdiction to grant the leave to appeal which is sought. (emphasis added)


	
	In R v Grierson (1933) 50 WN (NSW) 71 the appellant appealed against the severity of two sentences imposed upon him. In respect of one sentence no change was made. In respect of the other, the Court increased the sentence to life imprisonment. The report does not disclose what order was actually made. However, in the report of his subsequent application (R v Grierson (1937) 54 WN (NSW) 144) it is said:
	


He had already appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and that appeal had been dismissed.


	
	The basis for the second application was not identified, although the subsequent judgment of Rich J in the High Court said that it concerned new facts about a Crown witness. However, Jordan CJ (with whom Davidson and Halse Rogers JJ agreed) said:
	


In the case of the present application for leave to appeal, a preliminary objection has been taken on behalf of the Crown that the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the application by reason of the fact that an appeal has already been maintained to this Court, and dismissed after the merits had been determined. The point which has been raised is exactly covered by the decision of the Full Court of South Australia in R. v. Edwards (2), and I am of opinion that this Court should follow that decision. When an appeal has once been fully heard and disposed of, that is, in my opinion, an end of the matter so far as appeal is concerned, and the prisoner cannot continue to appeal from time to time thereafter, whenever a new point occurs to him or to his legal advisers or whenever a new fact is alleged to have come to light. This does not mean that injustice must necessarily occur when new substantial evidence pointing to a prisoner's innocence is discovered, after his appeal has been finally disposed of. In such a case recourse may be had to s. 26 of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912, or to s. 475 of the Crimes Act, 1900. There is no reason to suppose that the procedure provided by those sections is not adequate for the consideration it may now be sought to raise on behalf of the prisoner.

For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the preliminary objection taken on behalf of the Crown must be sustained, and that we must decline to entertain the present application.


	
	The Applicant sought special leave to appeal to the High Court. Special leave to appeal was refused: Grierson v The King (1938) 60 CLR 431. Rich J said (at p. 434):
	


[T]he jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal is confined within the limits of the Act and that when the court has heard an appeal on its merits and given its decision the appeal cannot be reopened.   


	
	Starke J said (at p. 435):
	


I agree entirely with the reasons given by Jordan C.J. for the decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales sitting as the Court of Criminal Appeal, and I can add nothing to them of any value.


	
	Dixon J said (at p.435):
	


The Supreme Court held, in accordance with a decision of the Supreme Court of South Australia (R. v. Edwards (No. 2) [1931] SASR 376), that a second appeal from a conviction could not be entertained after the dismissal, upon the merits, of an appeal or application for leave to appeal and that the first appeal could not be reopened after a final determination.

In my opinion this conclusion is correct. (emphasis added)


	
	McTiernan J agreed with both Rich J and Dixon J.
	
	
	A perusal of Jordan CJ’s judgment discloses that he said nothing at all about the situation where an application for leave to appeal has been refused. Certainly Edwards, to which Jordan CJ made reference, also refers to applications for leave but the issue in Grierson was a second application where an appeal had already been dismissed. The decision of this Court in Grierson does not stand for the principle that a second application for leave cannot be brought.
	
	
	In the High Court neither Rich J nor Starke J made any reference to an application for leave to appeal and the effect a dismissal of such an application would have on a subsequent application. Dixon J endorsed what was said in Edwards but the issue for the High Court did not concern an application for leave to appeal.
	
	
	There does not seem any doubt that Grierson is authority for the point that this Court and its equivalents in other states has no jurisdiction to entertain a second appeal where there has been a dismissal of the appeal on the merits. The issue is whether there is an exception to the principle and whether the principle extends, without exceptions, to the situation where leave to appeal is refused.
	
	
	In In Eastman v R [2008] FCAFC 62; (2008) 166 FCR 579; (2008) 184 A Crim R 1 at [45] the Full Court of the Federal Court collected the authorities which appear to allow an exception to the Grierson principle where the appeal court has denied procedural fairness, or has failed to deal with all of the grounds of appeal argued. Those authorities include: R v Lapa (No 2) (1995) 80 A Crim R 398; R v Pettigrew [1997] 1 Qd R 601; R v Saxon (1998) 101 A Crim R 71; R v Gust [2000] NSWCCA 287; R v Giri (No 2) [2001] NSWCCA 234; R v Pallister [2002] WASCA 68; (2002) 131 A Crim R 460; R v Preston [2004] SASC 77; (2004) 145 A Crim R 212; and R v Burrell [2007] NSWCCA 79.
	
	
	In Saxon Wood J (with whom Smart J and Sperling J agreed adding some remarks of their own), allowed for three exceptions as follows:
	



	
	where the earlier appeal was abandoned;
	
	
	where a ground of appeal had not been dealt with if application made before the judgment was perfected;
	
	
	where there has been a denial of procedural fairness.
	



	
	It may be noted that in R v Giri (No. 2) the Court appeared to accept that the bases for re-opening a civil judgment provided the appropriate test for consideration of whether an appeal to this Court should be re-opened, without considering Grierson or matters going to the jurisdiction of this Court from the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). That approach seems to have been accepted in passing in R v Burrell [2007] NSWCCA 79 at [31] but the High Court subsequently allowed an appeal from that decision.
	
	
	None of the cases mentioned was concerned, however, with the present issue of whether a refusal of leave to appeal produces the same result. It is necessary, therefore, to examine cases where this point has been raised.
	
	
	In Matta v R (1995) 126 FLR 127 the applicant had sought an extension of time to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia but that had been refused. Later, he made a further application for extension of time although the grounds of his proposed appeal differed from the earlier grounds. The application was refused. Pidgeon J said (at 129):
	


The order made by the Court at the earlier hearing was an order that time be refused and time was refused on the basis that the proposed grounds had no merit. As it was a refusal of time as distinct from a refusal for application for leave, can it be submitted that it is in a different category? In my view, the reasons of Sir Owen Dixon in Grierson indicate that it makes no difference that the first application is an extension of time. His Honour considered that the principles apply to both an appeal or application for leave to appeal and I would consider that similar reasoning would apply to an extension of time.


	
	Owen J said (at 131):
	


Once an appeal has been heard on the merits, all statutory rights of appeal have been exhausted. Any further appeal is incompetent: Grierson (supra) at 435-36. It matters not that the second application proceeds on different grounds from those advanced on the earlier occasion: Grierson (supra) at 432; Vella v R (1991) 52 A Crim R 298. The same principle applies whether the problem arises in a substantive appeal or in an application to extend time: R v Smith (No 2) (1969) QWN 50.


	
	This decision was later followed in Napier v State of Western Australia [2008] WASCA 106; (2008) 36 WAR 543. Although, in the interim, Postiglione was decided (on 24 July 1997), no reference was made to it in Napier. Napier, like Matta, did not involve an application for leave to appeal, nor did it involve a parity ground. However, the principle in Matta that Napier followed was that there was no difference between an appeal, an application for leave to appeal and an application to extend time. Postiglione might have suggested otherwise.
	
	
	R v Stead [1999] NSWCCA 41 was an application for leave to appeal from a sentence imposed on the Applicant. One of the grounds of appeal was based on parity with a co-offender. All of the grounds of appeal raised were fully considered in the judgment of Abadee J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Adams J agreed). When the issue arose of what order should be made to dispose of the appeal Abadee J said:
	


[37]   That comes to the proposed order. Viana is still to be sentenced and he is a co-offender. That matter would suggest that leave to appeal should be refused rather than an order being made to grant leave and dismiss the appeal: see Postiglione at 305.


	
	In addition, Spigelman CJ said:
	


[42]   The order of the Court is that leave to appeal is refused.

[43]   Mr Stead, the order of the Court is that leave is refused. That is a matter of some significance. Customarily the order the Court makes is that the Court grants leave to appeal and dismisses the appeal. Your counsel, Mr Conomos, will explain the difference to you.


	
	In R v Spiero [2001] SASC 19; (2001) 78 SASR 531 the applicant filed an application seeking leave to appeal against conviction and sentence. The applicant then escaped from prison and did not prosecute the appeal. The application for leave was summarily dismissed. After he was recaptured, the applicant filed a second application for leave to appeal against the sentence. One of the grounds concerned parity. Duggan J (with whom Doyle CJ and Williams J agreed) first noted that the appeal had not been heard on its merits. His Honour accepted that if leave had been granted but the appeal dismissed Grierson would have precluded the second application.
	
	
	Duggan J then said, after referring to the passage from the judgment of Dawson & Gaudron JJ in Postiglione:
	


[17]   It is apparent that their Honours were of the view that there will be some cases in which a further application for leave to appeal may be brought after the dismissal of an earlier application. Nevertheless, the circumstances of the previous application for leave to appeal will often have an important bearing on whether the court should grant leave to appeal on the subsequent application. Their Honours pointed out that it would be inappropriate to permit a subsequent application based on matters which were agitated on an earlier application. It is my view that it would also be inappropriate to grant leave on an application in which the grounds which were sought to be argued were available and could have been argued at the time of the earlier application.


	
	In R v A [2003] QCA 445 the applicant sought an extension of time to appeal against his conviction. That application was dismissed. He later brought a further application for an extension of time to appeal against his conviction although on different grounds from those previously relied on. McMurdo P (with whom Jones J agreed) said:
	


[25]   Although the applicant has had a prior application for an extension of time within which to appeal against conviction, that application was based on quite different grounds to those now raised. There is some debate as to whether, in those circumstances, this Court has jurisdiction to hear a further application for extension of time. Cases such as Grierson v R ; R v Smith ; R v Smith [No 2] and R v Kenny suggest this Court has no jurisdiction to determine a second application for an extension of time within which to appeal against conviction. On the other hand, Re Sinanovic’s Application, suggests that were the applicant able to establish that he had new matters demonstrating good prospects of success on appeal, this Court may have the power in the interests of justice to grant an application for an extension of time within which to appeal, even at this very late stage and after an earlier unsuccessful application on a separate basis. As the grounds of appeal sought to be argued by the applicant in the appeal here are without substance, it is unnecessary to express a concluded view on this point.


	
	Davies JA said:
	


[38] The principle stated in Grierson is based on the statutory nature of an appeal and the finality of a decision given on such an appeal. Moreover it was said in that case to apply equally to a dismissal on the merits of an application for leave to appeal.

[39] I do not think that the application of this principle to cases in which a previous appeal has been dismissed on its merits can now be in any doubt. And even if I had any doubt on that question I would feel bound to follow the now abundant authority in the High Court, this Court and other intermediate courts of appeal.

[40] The application of this principle to an earlier decision dismissing an application for leave to appeal is less clear, notwithstanding the statement by Dixon J in Grierson that it does apply. Such an order appears on its face to be an interlocutory one notwithstanding that it may be on the ground that the appeal would fail on its merits. However, the principle was applied to such a case by the Court of Criminal Appeal twice and appears to have been accepted by this Court in R v Pettigrew though the Court held that it had a limited power to reconsider such a decision. In my view there is a great deal to be said for the application of this principle to applications for leave to appeal against sentence in this Court as those applications are, in practice, treated as appeals. However, I do not find it necessary to reach a final conclusion on this question.

[41] In the present case, as the facts stated by the President show, what had previously been dismissed was an application for an extension of time within which to appeal against his conviction. That was, in my opinion, much more clearly an interlocutory order notwithstanding that the application was dismissed because the Court thought that there were no merits in the applicant's proposed appeal. In my opinion, therefore, such an order does not preclude this Court from hearing a further such application, though if it were based on the same grounds it would be bound to fail. It is therefore necessary to consider the merits of this application which is not on the same grounds.


	
	No reference was made by any of the judges to Postiglione.  Further, Davies JA’s conclusion at [41] was at variance with the Western Australian decisions in Matta and Napier which both concerned a second application seeking an extension of time in which to appeal.
	
	
	G.A.M. (No 2) was decided on 2 July 2004. It may be noted that no reference was made in it to Spiero or Stead.
	
	
	In R v Alameddine [2004] NSWCCA 286 the applicant sought leave to appeal against his sentence for a robbery committed in company. The appeal was unsuccessful. Wood CJ at CL (with whom Beazley JA and Hulme J agreed) said:
	


[97]   It follows, in my view, that error has not been shown. Submissions were received as to the orders which the Court should make, in the event of it deciding that the appeal lacked merit. This was related to the circumstance that the other persons charged with the armed robbery are yet to be tried and sentenced, leaving open the possibility that a fresh question of parity might arise in the event of one or more of them receiving a sentence that is more favourable than that passed upon the Applicant.

[98]   To allow for the possibility of a further appeal, it was submitted that the preferable course was to refuse leave to appeal, rather than to grant leave and to dismiss the present appeal. In support of this proposition reference was made to the observations of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Postiglione v R at 305:

Ordinarily, it is of no consequence whether an order is made dismissing an application for leave to appeal or whether leave is granted and the appeal dismissed. However, putting aside applications which are frivolous or vexatious, there is no reason in principle to prevent a person bringing a second application for leave to appeal if an earlier application has been dismissed. An application based on matters agitated on a previous application is properly to be regarded as frivolous or vexatious. But that is not the case where an application is based on a sentencing disparity which has subsequently emerged. That is always a possibility in a case of this kind. That being so, the interests of justice require that, if an application for leave against sentence is to be heard and determined against an Applicant before a co-accused is brought to trial, leave be refused, rather than that the appeal be dismissed.

[99] Kirby J provided some support for this approach, in so far as he observed, at 333:

In the nature of complaints of disparity in sentencing (and as the facts of this case demonstrate) it will quite often be the case that the disparity which is said to give rise to the justifiable sense of grievance is not finally known until a considerable time after the complaining prisoner was sentenced. Where the final sentencing of a co-offender, or of another relevant offender, remain outstanding it may well be sensible for a Court of Criminal Appeal to adopt the expedient proposed by Dawson and Gaudron JJ in their reasons.

[100]   I am of the view that there is always merit in disposing of appeals in a way that achieves finality, and that there is something of a chicken and egg argument involved in leaving the final determination of parity questions until all the relevant proceedings are concluded. I have however reached the conclusion, in this case, that the proper order is to refuse leave to appeal, upon the understanding, which was accepted by counsel for the Applicant, that if further leave is sought, then it will be limited to any question of parity that may arise in relation to the sentences which are passed upon any other persons who are convicted of or plead guilty to the subject offence.

[101]   Accordingly I propose that the Court make the following order;

1. Leave to appeal refused.


	
	In R v Parenzee [2008] SASC 245; (2008) 188 A Crim R 47 the applicant applied for an extension of time for permission to appeal (as it is called in South Australia). That application was refused after a hearing on the merits. He subsequently brought a second application for an extension of time for permission to appeal. The grounds relied upon in the second application differed from those considered in the first.
	
	
	Doyle CJ followed Spiero and after quoting the passage in Duggan J’s judgment ([102] above) he added:
	


[33] …The same distinction was adverted to by Mason CJ, Wilson and Brennan JJ in Coulter v R (1987-1988) 164 CLR 350 at 356 where their Honours said:

The jurisdiction which the Court exercises in determining an application for leave is not a proceeding in the ordinary course of litigation: Collins v R (1975) 133 CLR 120, at p 122. It is a preliminary procedure recognized by the legislature as a means of enabling the court to control in some measure the volume of appellate work requiring its attention.

[34] There is a significant difference between the hearing and disposition of an appeal against conviction, and the hearing and disposition of an application for permission to appeal, or for an order extending the time within which to appeal or to apply for permission to appeal. In the latter circumstances, the Court does not entertain or exercise jurisdiction over an appeal until permission is given to appeal, or until an order has been made extending the time within which to appeal and, if permission to appeal is required as well, an order granting permission to appeal is made.


	
	However, Bleby J (with whom Anderson J agreed) said:
	


[135] Notwithstanding the observations of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Postiglione v R ; the Victorian Court of Appeal has since confirmed the position taken by that Court in R v McNamara (No 2) . In R v GAM (No 2) the accused was convicted of a number of sexual offences against his step-daughter. He applied for leave to appeal against his convictions and sentence. The application for leave to appeal against the convictions was refused. The application in respect of the sentence was successful. The appeal was allowed and the sentence reduced. The Court’s determinations had been perfected. He later applied for an extension of time within which to file a further application for leave to appeal against the convictions on the ground that the complainant had given false evidence at the trial. The Court held that it had no power to reopen either an application for leave to appeal or an appeal which had been determined on the merits, even where fresh evidence was sought to be adduced.


	
	Bleby J then set out portions of Winneke P’s judgment including what appears at [79] above and concluded:
	


[138]   I respectfully agree with those observations. Callaway JA delivered a short concurring judgment and Eames JA agreed with Winneke P. Although not binding on this Court, given the similarity of the legislation, the decisions of the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v McNamara (No 2) and R v GAM (No 2) are highly persuasive and should be followed. There is nothing in any other decisions of this Court which would suggest otherwise.


	
	With great respect to Bleby J Spiero, a case to which he later makes reference at [143], does suggest otherwise and was a case Doyle CJ relied upon for his dissent.
	
	
	In Clay v R [2007] NSWCCA 106 the Applicant sought leave to appeal against a sentence imposed for a number of offences. Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hall J agreed) dealt with the grounds of appeal and said:
	


[31]   My conclusion that the appeal against sentence has no merit would normally lead to a proposal that leave be granted to appeal but that the appeal should be dismissed: see Bailey v Director of Public Prosecutions (1988) 62 ALJR 319; 34 A Crim R 154. However the Court has been informed that a co-offender of the applicant has recently been sentenced in the District Court. The Court has, therefore, been asked not to dismiss the appeal, if the Court were against the applicant on the arguments placed before it, but merely to refuse leave to appeal in order to permit the applicant to approach the Court if the issue of parity arises between the sentence imposed upon the applicant and that imposed upon the co-offender. That seems to me to be an appropriate course to take in the particular circumstances of this matter otherwise the applicant might be shut out from arguing a case of disparity that has merit.

[32]   Therefore I propose that the Court refuse the application for leave to appeal.


	
	In Eastman v R the applicant applied to re-open the hearing of his appeal which had been determined, and an appeal taken unsuccessfully to the High Court. The basis for the application was that evidence had emerged showing that he was unfit to be tried at the time of his trial. In the course of considering the application the Full Court of the Federal Court discussed the principle from Grierson. They also said:
	


[43]   It is interesting that, in Postiglione, Dawson and Gaudron JJ at 304–305 (with Kirby J agreeing at 333) expressed the view that a court of criminal appeal should adopt the practice of refusing leave to appeal against sentence, rather than granting leave and dismissing the appeal, in circumstances in which a co-offender remained to be sentenced. The purpose of such a practice would be to permit a second application for leave, if the offender first sentenced wished to raise the question of disparity between his or her sentence and the sentence of the co-offender. A second application for leave would be possible, because the first appeal would not have been determined on the merits. The proposed practice rests on the assumption that the principle established in Grierson is applicable, namely that an appeal heard and determined on the merits cannot be reopened and a second appeal cannot be maintained.


	
	The issue did not need to be further considered for the purpose of the application being made.
	
	
	In R v Upson (No 2) [2013] QCA 149; (2013) 229 A Crim R 275 the applicant appealed against his conviction and applied for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed. The appeal was dismissed and the application for leave to appeal was refused: R v Upson [2011] QCA 196. Fraser JA (with whom Holmes JA and Daubney J agreed) preferred what Davies JA said in R v A to what McMurdo P and Jones J had said (see at [103]-[104] above), and held that an application for leave to appeal was in the same position as an appeal. The result was that if leave to appeal was refused there was no jurisdiction in the court to entertain a further application. As in R v A there was no mention of Postiglione in Upson.
	
	
	The position appears to be, therefore, that despite support from some individual judges in South Australia, Queensland and the Federal Court, jurisdictions other than New South Wales do not allow a second application for leave to appeal even where the order made was that leave was refused, except in circumstances where there has been a dismissal of the leave application through abandonment or some similar basis. Indeed, in Western Australia (although not, it would seem in Queensland – see Davies JA in R v A and Fraser JA in Upson (No.2)) even an application for extension of time is said to fall within the Grierson principle.  The failure, however, of some of the judgments in those jurisdictions to refer to Postiglione and examine how it can stand with Grierson diminishes the authority of those decisions.
	
	
	Although Winneke P in G.A.M. was not prepared to accept a distinction between an appeal and an application for leave to appeal where the merits had been determined, that view does not find support from Grierson other than what is contained in the judgment of Dixon J. Nor, with the greatest respect to the Court of Appeal in Victoria, does it have sufficient regard to what Dawson and Gaudron JJ said:
	


That, if an application for leave against sentence is to be heard and determined against an applicant before a co-accused is brought to trial, leave be refused, rather than that the appeal be dismissed.


	
	Such a distinction could not have been made if Grierson (to which they had referred and accepted its correctness (at p.300)) stood for the proposition that the dismissal of an application for leave to appeal would preclude a further application. It seems likely, therefore, that they accepted that the judges, apart from Dixon J, were speaking only of the dismissal of an appeal and not the refusal of leave to appeal. That is not entirely surprising given that in Grierson all that was being determined was the right of an applicant to appeal a second time, or to seek leave to do so, where the first appeal had been dismissed.
	
	
	There is the further matter of the authority of the High Court’s decision in Grierson. What was before it was a special leave application that was refused. In Milat v The Queen [2004] HCA 17; (2004) 78 ALJR 672 McHugh J said at [26], citing Collins v The Queen (1975) 133 CLR 120 at 122, that until special leave is granted the High Court’s jurisdiction is not engaged. McHugh J also said in North Ganalanja Aboriginal Corporation v Queensland (1996) 185 CLR 595 at 643:
	


Refusal of special leave creates no precedent and is binding on no one. An application for special leave is merely an application to commence proceedings in the Court. Only when the Court grants leave does it commence to exercise its appellate jurisdiction. Until that time, there are no parties whose rights can be the subject of a binding determination.


	
	Moreover, only Dixon J made any reference to applications for leave to appeal. Whilst McTiernan J agreed with Dixon J he also agreed with Rich J who decided the matter solely on the basis of a prior appeal that had been dismissed.
	
	
	Postiglione is a later decision of the High Court. It was a judgment on a final hearing. Three of the five judges endorsed the principle identified. Although the remarks were obiter, they must be regarded as “seriously considered” dicta of a majority of the Court with the result that they are binding: Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; (2007) 230 CLR 89 at [134] and [158].
	
	
	Bearing in mind that Grierson involved a second application where an appeal had previously been dismissed, it can be seen from the above survey that decisions in New South Wales have consistently made a distinction between an order dismissing an appeal and an order refusing leave to appeal, as Alameddine, Stead and Clay demonstrate. No reason has been shown for departing from that line of authority which has the imprimatur of three of the judges in the High Court in Postiglione. Further, and with due respect to the High Court, no better reason could be given for the view they reached than the injustice which might otherwise result from a disparity of sentencing of co-offenders at different times.
	


The present application


	
	The present position as a result of the last successful appeal of Sinkovich is that he received a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months in respect of Count 2. That sentence was imposed after a trial and with no discount. On the other hand, for the equivalent count being CAN Sequence 5 the Applicant received a non-parole period of 8 years with an additional term of 4 years taking into account a discount of 25% for an early plea. The notional starting point for the Applicant’s sentence on this count was 16 years whereas the co-offender received an overall sentence on this count of 11 years.
	
	
	On the basis of this Court’s conclusions on the first appeal by the Applicant at [75] and [76], it must be held that there is a stark disparity in the sentences and one that would give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the Applicant. However, on the basis of this Court’s conclusions at [93] – [95] on the Applicant’s first appeal, the issue to be determined on the present application is whether no less a sentence is warranted on this Count bearing in mind the totality principle by reason of the sentences for the other counts.
	
	
	The conclusion that this Court reached in the first application by the present Applicant was influenced by the fact that in Sinkovich’s first application to this Court, this Court dismissed his appeal because the sentences imposed were not manifestly excessive. The effect of Sinkovich (No. 2) is that error infected the sentencing process. That error was conceded by the Crown. The only issue for the Court was whether a lesser sentence was warranted. The Court considered that a lesser sentence was warranted, looking particularly at the non-parole period imposed by the Sentencing Judge.
	
	
	That is a significant matter where the sentence imposed on the present Applicant for the corresponding offence is markedly disparate and gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.
	
	
	The Crown argued that the sentences on the present Applicant and Sinkovich had both been imposed by the same judge and that there was much greater criminality overall in the present Applicant to justify the heavier sentences imposed. If followed from that, the Crown argued, that despite the reduction in Sinkovich’s sentence, no less a sentence was warranted in the present matter. However, if a lesser sentence were to be imposed for CAN Sequence 5 the same conclusion should be reached as was reached at [93] to [95] of the Court’s earlier judgment in Lowe so that the sentences overall would be adjusted to produce the same result.
	
	
	In my opinion, there should be an adjustment for the Applicant’s sentence in respect of CAN Sequence 5 because the disparity between his sentence and Sinkovich’s sentence is considerable and the reduction by this Court of Sinkovich’s sentence provides an indication that a lesser sentence is warranted for the present Applicant.
	
	
	In my opinion, the appropriate sentence for CAN Sequence 5 should be a non-parole period of 7 years with an additional term of 3 years and 6 months to maintain the ratio fixed by the Sentencing Judge. The sentence should commence from 4 July 2010 with the non-parole period expiring on 3 July 2017 and the additional term expiring 3 January 2021. I would not make any adjustment to the other sentences. This will mean that the total effective non-parole period will be 9 years with an additional term of 3 years and 6 months.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal granted;

(2)   Allow the appeal in respect of CAN Sequence 5;

(3)   Quash the sentence in respect of CAN Sequence 5;

(4)   In lieu, sentence the appellant to a non-parole period of 7 years commencing 4 July 2010 and expiring 3 July 2017 with an additional term of 3 years and 6 months expiring 3 January 2021.

2424512,R v McNeil [2015] NSWSC 357,"JUDGMENT


	
	JOHNSON J: By Notice of Motion filed on 30 January 2015, the Applicant, Shaun Stuart McNeil, makes application under s.132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to be tried by a Judge alone.
	
	
	The Applicant has completed an election under s.132(1) dated 29 January 2015, which certifies that he has received advice from his legal representatives in relation to the effect of an order for trial by Judge alone. Accordingly, the requirement in s.132(6) is satisfied.
	
	
	The Crown does not agree to the Applicant being tried by a Judge alone. It falls to the Court to determine whether an order under s.132 should be made in the circumstances of this case.
	


Charges Against the Applicant


	
	On 5 December 2014, the Applicant was arraigned on an indictment containing the following counts:
	



	
	Count 1 - On 31 December 2013 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales he did murder Daniel Christie.
	
	
	Count 2 - On 31 December 2013 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales he did assault Peter Christie thereby occasioning to him actual bodily harm.
	
	
	Count 3 - On 31 December 2013 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales he did assault Jack Fynn.
	
	
	Count 4 - On 31 December 2013 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales he did assault Tyrone Smith.
	
	
	Count 5 - On 31 December 2013 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales he did assault Toni Gill.
	



	
	On arraignment, the Applicant pleaded guilty to Counts 2 and 3, and not guilty to each of Counts 1, 4 and 5.
	
	
	The trial of the Applicant is fixed to commence at the Supreme Court in Sydney on 25 May 2015.
	


The Present Application


	
	As the application for an order under s.132 was brought more than 28 days before the date fixed for the trial in this Court, the Applicant does not require the leave of the Court to make the application: s.132A(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	Although the s.132 application is proceeding before me, I will not be the trial Judge.
	
	
	The bringing of the application in this way, well in advance of the trial, accords with an apparent statutory purpose that an application for a Judge-alone trial should be made (at least ordinarily) without knowing the identity of the trial Judge.
	
	
	In the course of the second reading speech for the Courts and Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Bill 2010, which introduced s.132A, the then Attorney General, Mr Hatzistergos, said (Hansard, Legislative Council, 24 November 2010):
	


“The new section 132A sets out procedural matters regarding trial by judge orders, including that applications are to be made no less than 28 days before the trial date, except by leave of the court. This is designed to minimise the risk of a party applying for a judge-alone trial on the basis of knowing the identity of the trial judge.”


	
	It has been observed that earlier versions of ss.132-132A had been drafted to avoid the appearance that the accused person was making an election in the light of the knowledge of the identity of the trial Judge: R v Perry (1993) 29 NSWLR 589 at 594; R v Coles (1993) 31 NSWLR 550 at 552-553; R v Simmons; R v Moore (No. 4) [2015] NSWSC 259 at [20]-[29].
	


Hearing of the Application


	
	The hearing of the application proceeded on 30 March 2015. At the commencement of the hearing, an order was made, until further order of the Court, prohibiting publication of the fact that this application was being made and of the evidence and submissions made on the application.
	
	
	Mr Smith SC, for the Applicant, read the affidavits of Daniel Covington affirmed 30 January 2015 and 9 March 2015. These affidavits annexed copies of a substantial volume of media publicity concerning the Applicant, published in both hard copy and electronic form. In addition, the Applicant tendered a Google search of the name “Shaun McNeil” conducted in Court on 30 March 2015 (Exhibit A) and a list of videos connected with that Google search (Exhibit B). An excerpt from the Channel 7 “Sunrise” program in early January 2014 was played in Court.
	
	
	The Crown read the affidavit of Jennifer Price sworn 26 March 2015, which related to a number of items of media publicity concerning the Applicant. In addition, the Crown tendered the Crown Case Statement (Exhibit 1), paragraphs 2-13 of the Crown submissions which constituted a form of revised Crown Case Statement (Exhibit 2), a disk containing a compilation of CCTV footage recorded on 31 December 2013 (Exhibit 3) and a sketch plan of Victoria Street, Potts Point (Exhibit 4).
	
	
	Exhibit 3 was played to the Court at the hearing.
	
	
	There was no oral evidence on the application. Detailed and helpful written submissions had been filed prior to the hearing on behalf of the Applicant and the Crown and counsel spoke to these submissions.
	


The Crown Case Against the Applicant


	
	The Crown case against the Applicant was described in the following way at paragraphs 2-31 of the Crown written submissions (Exhibit 2):
	


“2.   The Deceased, Daniel Christie, was 18 years old. During the afternoon of 31 December 2013 he and his older brother, Peter, who was 20 years old at the time made plans to go to city. They travelled by train and arrived at Kings Cross at about 7.15 pm. By 9 pm they were on Darlinghurst Rd walking in the direction of its intersection with Victoria St.

3.   The Accused and his partner, Sonya Walker also travelled to the city arriving at Wynyard at about 3pm. He consumed some alcohol on the way. They went to Jacksons on George. The Accused consumed 4 schooners of Tooheys New while they were there. They left at about 4.45pm. They spent some time in the city and walked to Kings Cross. The Accused told police that he had ‘sobered up by the time we got to the Cross. The Accused estimated that he had had 6 to 7 beers between 2 pm - 6 pm.

4.   The Accused and Walker went to Dlux Backpackers on Darlinghurst Rd. The Accused had worked with Mark Flood, a long term resident and wanted to visit him. The Accused spoke to the manager, whom he knew from previous visits. The manager gave the Accused a stubbie of Carlton draught beer.

5.   The Accused and Walker went to Flood's room. Flood was there and they all went up to the roof. Flood described the Accused as hyperactive, sociable and intoxicated.

6.   They all went up to the rooftop were there was a gathering of people. They took some Strongbow cider. The Accused stated in his ERISP that he had two strongbows and one cup of wine at the Dlux. The Accused remained up on the roof until just before 9pm. By 8.54pm the Accused and Walker were on Darlinghurst Rd. They walked in the direction of its intersection with Victoria St.

7.   Tyrone Smith, Toni Gill and Jack Fynn were together that night. They came into contact with the Accused on Darlinghurst Rd close to the pedestrian crossing and the intersection with Victoria St. They came into contact with the Accused and Walker. The accounts vary of what exactly transpired.

8.   One or more of the three offered the Accused drugs. One of the three punched the Accused to the mouth and all three allege that he hit them. CCTV footage shows that the Accused punched Fynn to the head and Fynn fell to the grounds on the footpath. The Acused [sic] then kicked Fynn to the stomach. The Accused also said that he was an ‘MMA fighter.’ Gill ran down Victoria St towards Daniel and Peter Christie.

9.   Peter and Daniel Christie had walked from Darlinghurst Rd to Victoria St. They must have passed behind the Accused. Peter Christie saw Jack Fynn sitting in the middle of the pedestrian crossing. Fynn appeared dazed. Peter and Daniel stopped 10m away, concerned with what they saw. Accused has pleaded guilty to an assault on Fynn.

10.   The Accused went to Fynn who was still on the ground. The Accused lifted Fynn from the ground. Walker yelled out to the Accused. Walker tried to pull the Accused away. Walker grabbed the Accused by the arm and said, ‘just leave it Shaun, come on let's go home.’ The Accused did not answer and broke free from her grip and went down Victoria St. Walker stayed on the corner.

11.   Peter Christie turned and saw Daniel talking to Gill. Gill said, ‘This dude has just hit all of us.’ Gill pointed to the Accused who at that time went up to Fynn and pulled him up from the ground. The Accused directed and/or pushed Fynn along Victoria St in the direction of Peter and Daniel Christie. Walker yelled out at him to come back.

12.   The Accused walked down Victoria St. He veered towards Daniel Christie. Daniel was standing with his hands by his sides. As the Accused got close to Daniel and Peter he was getting really angry and 'shaping up'. The Accused said a number of times, ‘I'm an MMA fighter.’ The Accused was also swearing and yelling.’ Daniel said, ‘what's going on?’ and/or ‘What are you hitting a kid for?’

13.   The Accused turned his attention to Daniel and said, ‘You think I'm ...’ Peter could not make out the rest. Daniel backed away and put his hands up in a defensive manner, saying ‘no, no, no, no’.

14.   Peter saw the Accused suddenly swing a ‘massive’ right hook with his right fist connecting with the left side of Daniel's head. Daniel Clancy who was in an upstairs bar in the Kings Cross Hotel saw the Accused throw a right hook that connected with the left of Daniel's chin. Daniel's head swung to the right. Both of Daniel's hands were by his side. Daniel stiffened and then fell backwards. Gill and Fynn saw the Accused punch Daniel in the face.

15.   Raymond Taylor who was out the front of the Kings Cross Hotel saw the Accused swing his right arm from his side and hit Daniel in the area of his nose with a closed fist. Daniel fell back with arms still by his side. Manas Upadhay who was in a car parked across Victoria St saw the Accused and Daniel pushing each other before the Accused punched Daniel to the head area.

16.   Daniel's body went limp and he fell to the ground hitting his head on the road. He was knocked out before he hit the ground. There was a loud crack as his head hit the road.

17.   Peter stood between the Accused and Daniel. Peter started swinging or pushing at the Accused. The Accused swung at least another punch and hit Peter in the mouth. The punch split Peter's lip. Peter stumbled back and fell to the ground. The Accused has pleaded guilty to an assault occasioning bodily harm on Peter Christie.

18.   Tyrone Smith approached a group of police at the intersection of Darlinghurst Rd and Bayswater Road and told them, ‘There is a guy punching people on Victoria Street’. They went there in response.

19.   The Accused walked back towards Darlinghurst Rd. Two security guards from the Kings Cross Hotel told the police ‘it's him, its [sic] him’ and pointed to the Accused, whom the police had run past.

20.   DSC Semken stopped and turned around and saw the Accused. He had his arms up and said, ‘I did it, I hit him.’ Constable Downy arrested the Accused. The Accused said, ‘yeah, I know. I'm sorry. He came at me first.’ And/or ‘It was a reaction he started it, I was just protecting my girl. I'm sorry. Is he alright?’

21.   The Accused was bleeding from nose and mouth and had blood on both of his hands.

22.   DSC Semken continued to walk to Victoria St where he saw Daniel Christie lying on his back on Victoria St just outside of the Mercure Hotel. An ambulance was called.

23.   The Crown case includes evidence from CCTV footage from various cameras around the scenes of the two altercations.

24.   The Accused was interviewed briefly after his arrest and later participated in an ERISP. He told police that he had been drinking all day but that he was not affected by alcohol.

25.   He met four or five men at the corner of Darlinghurst Rd and Victoria St. They offered him caps. One of them made a comment about Walker and he pushed that person away. He was hit twice in the mouth. The altercation continued and he hit out at one of them.

26.   He went around the corner because he felt that he needed to before they came back at him. There were three persons and one (or more) of them was coming quickly at him. He hit that person. He did not hit hard. It was just a quick jab. They were the same three people that had been at the corner of Darlinghurst Rd and Victoria St. He punched one out of instinct in an upper cut. He felt threatened because the person was about to hit him and because Walker was behind him. He walked back and the police had arrived.

27.   He had training in what he described as UFC (United Fighting Championship) for strength and physique and to protect himself. He had never fought in a bout.

28.   He said that the same people had been on Darlinghurst Rd as had been further down Victoria St. The same people were involved but there were two incidents.

29.   The Deceased died from blunt force trauma to the head. Many of the abnormalities identified were secondary to mass effect and severe widespread hypoxic/ischaemic damage that occurred subsequent to the primary traumatic injuries. Some of these changes may have obscured or mimicked primary traumatic injuries.

30.   Blood was taken from the Accused while he was [in] police custody. From that sample there is an opinion from Dr Perl that the Accused's blood alcohol concentration at 9pm would have been within a range of .155 to .275, with a most likely level around .195. The blood alcohol concentration could have been 10-20% lower than the recorded result because of the method of testing. Footage from a short interview with police at the time of his arrest suggests that the Accused did not indicate behaviour consistent with that level of intoxication and a high degree of tolerance was suggested.

31.   The Accused's blood was tested for steroids, the result and the available expert evidence do not provide any basis for alleging that steroid use contributed to the commission of the offence.”

The Trial Issues From the Applicant’s Perspective


	
	Mr Smith SC informed the Court of what he expected to be the issues at trial.
	
	
	After noting the pleas of guilty which had been entered in response to Counts 2 and 3, Mr Smith SC continued (T17.8-47, 30 March 2015):
	


“SMITH: That leaves count 1, the murder; what will be a statutory alternative of manslaughter to count 1; count 4 concerning Tyrone Smith, an assault; and count 5, Tony Gill, an assault. If I could just take those each in turn. As to count 1, the murder, your Honour should understand that it may be that, whether or not he delivered the blow, that is committed the act, may be still an issue; but your Honour would understand that the main issue on count 1 will be intention. As I understand the Crown case, the Crown does not say this is an intent to kill case. The Crown puts it as an intent to do really serious bodily harm, and that is in issue. 

The statutory alternative to count 1, the manslaughter, again your Honour should understand, with respect, what I've said in relation to murder as to that the act may still be an issue. Your Honour would understand this: that on the assumption that the Crown proves the relevant act for the statutory alternative, there would not be a submission made by me that such an act was not dangerous. I will come back to dangerousness. 

As to counts 4 and 5, the assaults on those two young men, the main issue is whether the Crown can prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was in fact the act as alleged. 

Can I make it clear that I do not currently intend to make any submission on self defence on the assumption for the moment that there was in fact evidence in the Crown case capable of it being left. Again, I will come back to self defence in due course. 

That was point one in our case. 

HIS HONOUR: Does that mean it is not your intention to make any submission with respect to self defence with respect to the three matters which are defended; namely, the charge of murder or the statutory alternative of manslaughter with respect to Daniel Christie, and then the assault on Tyrone Smith and the assault on Tony Gill? 

SMITH: Yes, it is. 

HIS HONOUR: It applies to all of those? 

SMITH: Yes, to each of the defended counts. I will speak more with respect to self defence a little bit later.”


	
	With respect to the statutory alternative of manslaughter and the concept of dangerousness, Mr Smith SC said (T22.47-23.8, 30 March 2015):
	


“Could I make these practical submissions. On the assumption that the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused delivered the relevant act for count 1 and the statutory alternative to count 1, there will be no submission that such an act was not dangerous. In my respectful submission, it would be bordering on the ridiculous to suggest otherwise. And that issue, that is whether it was dangerous or not, comes in the context of a one punch case where, on the Crown case, it was delivered with force from a well built man. It would be a rare case, in my submission, where there could be a more simple matter for a jury to determine in terms of dangerousness. Just to put that another way, it is so clear in this matter that it becomes not an irrelevant consideration, with respect, but a consideration which has much less weight in the mix than other matters. But clearly it's relevant.”


	
	Mr Smith SC returned to the issue of self-defence in the following way (T23.14-36, 30 March 2015):
	


“SMITH: … I don't repeat what I said to your Honour previously about his case, but I make the submission again here, particularly on count 1. Your Honour has seen the CCTV footage this morning. On the Crown case what happens is the applicant leaves the area of the pedestrian crossing and then moves down that street around the corner, the Crown described it about 15 to 20 metres down the corner, to a position away from where the initial incident occurred to a position where the deceased and his brother was and, on the Crown case, in effect, walked up, and, as I understand the Crown case, punched him. It is open for your Honour to ask the Crown how it could be conceivable that self defence would be left in those circumstances. But, in my respectful submission, on the evidence before your Honour, I would have thought it is unlikely that it could be left on the material before your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Another way in which self defence might be left is if it is raised as a result of some evidence in the defence case, if there is a defence case. What do you want to say about that topic? 

SMITH: I think that's unlikely and highly unlikely. 

But, and I say this with respect, there's a difference to a Crown position saying that it may be raised to a Crown submission to your Honour on a judge alone application that we are saying to your Honour that as a matter of law this will have to be left to a jury by a trial judge.”


	
	It will be appropriate to keep these indications in mind when considering a number of submissions raised on the present application.
	


Relevant Statutory Provisions


	
	Section 131 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides as follows:
	


“131 Trial by jury in criminal proceedings

Criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or the District Court are to be tried by a jury, except as otherwise provided by this Part.”


	
	Section 132 provides:
	


“132    Orders for trial by Judge alone

(1)    An accused person or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court may apply to the court for an order that the accused person be tried by a Judge alone (a trial by judge order).

(2)    The court must make a trial by judge order if both the accused person and the prosecutor agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone.

(3)    If the accused person does not agree to being tried by a Judge alone, the court must not make a trial by judge order.

(4)    If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so.

(5)    Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.

(6)    The court must not make a trial by judge order unless it is satisfied that the accused person has sought and received advice in relation to the effect of such an order from an Australian legal practitioner.

(7)    The court may make a trial by judge order despite any other provision of this section or section 132A if the court is of the opinion that:

(a)    there is a substantial risk that acts that may constitute an offence under Division 3 of Part 7 of the Crimes Act 1900 are likely to be committed in respect of any jury or juror, and

(b)    the risk of those acts occurring may not reasonably be mitigated by other means.”


	
	As will be seen, s.132(4) and (5) are the critical provisions on this application. Section 132(7) does not arise in this case.
	
	
	Section 132A is in the following terms:
	


“132A Applications for trial by judge alone in criminal proceedings

(1)    An application for an order under section 132 that an accused person be tried by a Judge alone must be made not less than 28 days before the date fixed for the trial in the Supreme Court or District Court, except with the leave of the court.

(2)    An application must not be made in a joint trial unless:

(a)    all other accused person apply to be tried by a Judge alone, and

(b)    each application is made in respect of all offences with which the accused persons in the trial are charged that are being proceeded with in the trial.

(3)    An accused person or a prosecutor who applies for an order under section 132 may, at any time before the date fixed for the accused person’s trial, subsequently apply for a trial by a jury.

(4)    Rules of court may be made with respect to applications under section 132 or this section.”

Some General Principles Concerning an Application for Trial by Judge Alone


	
	It has been said that, despite the terms of s.131, there is no presumption that a criminal trial should proceed with a jury, thereby casting a burden of proof on an applicant under s.132 to displace such a presumption: R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; 217 A Crim R 1 at 25 [96], 29-30 [118]; R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 at [42]; R v Villalon [2013] NSWSC 1516 at [20].
	
	
	That does not mean, however, that the choice between trial by jury and trial by Judge alone commences with a blank canvas. The Courts have recognised the important role of juries, drawn from the community, in the administration of criminal justice in this State.
	
	
	In R v Jamal [2008] NSWCCA 177; 72 NSWLR 258, Spigelman CJ (Simpson and Price JJ agreeing) said at 262 [24]:
	


“The central significance of the jury in the administration of criminal justice in Australia is such that the courts should be, on any view, exceptionally reluctant to insist that the system be bypassed, even when seeking to implement the principle of a fair trial. For serious crimes a fair trial in our system of criminal justice is a trial by jury, subject to statutory exception. The community has a right to participate in the administration of criminal justice, and public confidence in that system turns to a significant degree upon that participation. Furthermore, it must not be forgotten that a fair trial is not only a trial fair for the accused, it is also a trial fair to the community represented by the prosecution.”


	
	Although this statement of Spigelman CJ was made in the context of a case where s.132 in its earlier form was under consideration (where the Crown could veto a Judge-alone application by an accused person), the sentiments there expressed remain helpful.
	
	
	Observations made by Gleeson CJ in Swain v Waverley Municipal Council [2005] HCA 4; 220 CLR 517, in the context of a civil case, have been cited regularly in decisions under s.132. The Chief Justice said at 521 [7]:
	


“… decision-making by the collective verdict of a group of citizens, rather than by the reasoned judgment of a professional judge, is a time-honoured and important part of our justice system. It also has the important collateral advantages of involving the public in the administration of justice, and of keeping the law in touch with community standards.”


	
	Considerations of the type referred to in these statements from R v Jamal and Swain v Waverley Municipal Council constitute an important factor in the exercise of discretion under s.132(4).
	
	
	Although a s.132 applicant does not carry a burden of proof, he or she does bear an evidentiary burden: R v Stanley at [42].
	
	
	Section 132(4) identifies the test to be applied on an application such as this. The Court may make an order for trial by Judge alone “if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so”. That formulation confers a wide discretion on the Judge determining the application: R v Stanley at [23].
	
	
	Section 132(5) is not an exhaustive statement of the circumstances in which an order may be refused. Rather, it provides illustrations of circumstances in which refusal may occur. The legislature has provided some specific examples to be considered in this respect. Section 132(5) acknowledges that, when considering where the interests of justice lie, it will be relevant that where the trial involves an issue which may be informed by community standards or expectations, the interests of justice may be best served by utilising a jury of lay people: R v Belghar at 25 [96]; R v Villalon at [20].
	
	
	Submissions were made for the Applicant that the absence of words such as “intention” and “credibility” from s.132(5) was noteworthy and indicated a legislative intention to omit factors of that type as examples of “objective community standards”.
	
	
	I will refer a little later to a number of decisions where “intention” has been considered in this context. For the moment, I observe that it would, in my view, be erroneous to read s.132(5) in a manner inconsistent with its terms. There may be a myriad of issues which arise in a criminal trial which may fall for consideration on a s.132 application. Section 132(5) should be construed as containing a number of illustrations which the legislature considered were worthy of mention. However, the test to be applied is the interests of justice test posed in s.132(4), with that test to be considered in the context of the particular case.
	
	
	In forming a view as to what the interests of justice require, a balancing of various interests is required, including the interests of the parties and also larger questions of legal principle, the public interest and policy considerations: Landsman v R [2014] NSWCCA 328 at [69]. The important role of juries in the administration of criminal justice (mentioned at [30]-[33]) may be seen as touching issues of policy and the public interest, which arise for consideration in determining what the interests of justice require.
	
	
	In R v Stanley, Barr AJ (Macfarlan JA and Campbell J agreeing) said at [42]-[43]:
	


“42   … The fact that the applicant has decided on legal advice to relinquish any benefit of trial by jury is something the Court should take into account, but that and any apprehension that he will not receive a fair trial at the hands of a jury must be weighed. A mere stated apprehension without supporting evidence will not be enough. As Chesterman JA said in R v Fardon at [81], an accused cannot have a trial by judge alone for the asking. See generally the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in R v Belghar at [96] - [97]. See also the judgment of Bellew J in R v Sean Lee King [2013] NSWSC 448 at [40] - [46]. 

43   In weighing the concerns of the applicant the Court must have regard to any means available to allay them. The Court should also bear in mind that the interests of the accused are not necessarily the interests of justice. The community receives important collateral benefits from trial by jury in the involvement of the public in the administration of justice and in keeping the law in touch with community standards: Gleeson CJ in Swain v Waverley Municipal Council [2005] HCA 4, (2005) 220 CLR 517 at [7].”


	
	I will refer to statements emerging from other authorities, in the context of addressing particular issues raised on the application.
	


The Media Publicity Issue


	
	The principal issue advanced by the Applicant on the s.132 application was the prejudicial media publicity concerning the Applicant and his alleged involvement in these offences.
	
	
	It is not necessary to recite in detail the written and oral submissions made on behalf of the Applicant and the Crown.
	


Overview of Submissions


	
	Put shortly, Mr Smith SC submitted that the media publicity, in both hard copy and electronic form, surrounding the events giving rise to this trial is such that members of a jury panel would undoubtedly have been exposed to it. The publicity includes images of the Applicant, details of his criminal history and commentary arising from the public controversy concerning so-called one punch attacks in the Kings Cross area in 2013.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Applicant submitted that the media publicity suggested violent and dishonest tendencies on the part of the Applicant, often linked with inflammatory images of him. Amongst the media publicity was reference to the fact that one of his earlier convictions was for assault upon his partner, Ms Walker, who was to be a Crown witness in the trial.
	
	
	It was emphasised for the Applicant that this material was readily available now in electronic form. The ease and speed with which it could be accessed, even after a jury is empanelled, it was submitted, speaks to the real and potential prejudice to the Applicant in a jury trial. It was submitted that carefully crafted directions cannot cure the prejudice to the Applicant.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that there was a substantial volume of prejudicial media publicity surrounding the arrest and charging of the Applicant. It was emphasised, however, that the media publicity in evidence occurred very largely in the period between January and March 2014.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to some parts of the electronic commentary concerning the Applicant which was said to be puerile and, using the words of Harrison J in R v Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 729; 230 A Crim R 74 at 94 [62], “irrational and suspect musings of faceless people intent on mischief”.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to other parts of the media publicity, which concerned broader issues of public interest concerning the consumption and supply of alcohol in the Kings Cross area, and its interaction with violent incidents. It was submitted that public discussion of this sort was to be expected, and was also confined largely to the period up to March 2014.
	
	
	The Crown emphasised the significant passage of time since the material in question was first published, and the availability and capacity of jury directions to address concerns which the Applicant may have.
	
	
	Reference was made to s.68C Jury Act 1977 which would apply to the jury once empanelled, thereby prohibiting any enquiry, including internet searching, during the course of the trial.
	


Decision Concerning Media Publicity


	
	It is appropriate to provide some examples of the media publicity to which the Court was taken on the hearing of this application, to give the flavour of the material relied upon by the Applicant.
	
	
	The material falls into several categories:
	



	
	online articles referring to the Applicant’s criminal record and associating him with violence;
	
	
	online video clips with similar content;
	
	
	newspaper articles with similar content;
	
	
	a Facebook page in the Applicant’s name which is said to be a fictional profile set up by unknown people.
	



	
	An online article of “The Daily Telegraph” of 1 January 2014, reporting the Applicant’s first court appearance, stated (Annexure A, affidavit, Daniel Covington, 30 January 2015):
	


“McNeil wept in court during his initial hearing yesterday.

Sydney should weep instead that someone with McNeil’s extensive criminal history, which includes several convictions for violence, should have been allowed to mix with innocent and vulnerable citizens on one of the biggest nights of the year.

The presence of so many repeat violent offenders in open society is like permitting drunk drivers on our roads, and leads to the same dreadful conclusions.”


	
	The Applicant’s Facebook page included words said to have been written by the Applicant (Annexure B, page 6):
	


“Monsters don’t sleep under your bed, they sleep inside your head.”


	
	A later entry on www.smh.com.au on 3 January 2014 (Annexure C, page 2) asserted that the words in the preceding paragraph were uploaded to the Facebook page on Christmas day, and were sourced from Heath Ledger’s character “The Joker” in the movie “Batman”.
	
	
	In the same article, the following appeared:
	


“A former colleague at Sydney City Removals, who did not want his name published, said Mr McNeil often spoke to him about taking and selling drugs.

He also said he had boasted about being a member of the Rebels motorcycle club’s Rhodes chapter and showed colleagues photos of himself in the club’s patches.”


	
	A “Daily Telegraph” online article on 4 January 2014 included the following (Annexure H, page 3):
	


“McNeil’s shocking criminal record, obtained through tendered court documents made available to The Daily Telegraph, reveals four assaults, at least two of them on women, breaching two apprehended domestic violence orders, breaching a good behaviour bond through excessive drinking, possessing a knife and possessing drugs.”

The Applicant’s criminal history was set out in the same article.


	
	The same article referred to the Applicant’s offence allegedly committed against his partner, Ms Walker (Annexure H, pages 6-7):
	


“Ms Walker, 25, who this week told The Daily Telegraph that her partner was loving and caring, became one of his victims when he assaulted her on New Year’s Eve 2011.

Court documents show the couple had an argument over her clothing in the Scary Canary Hotel on Kent St in the CBD about 1am. As they walked home to their then-unit in Kent St, McNeil pushed her up against a street pole and squeezed her so hard she had difficulty breathing.

Two passers-by came to her aid but when they left, McNeil pushed her into a concrete wall.”


	
	A newspaper article in “The Daily Telegraph” on 2 January 2014 contained extensive coverage (including photographs) over several pages, of the Applicant and Daniel Christie. One article concerning the Applicant was headed (Annexure V):
	


“Gym junkie into martial arts, rappers and selfies.”


	
	A newspaper article in “The Daily Telegraph” on 3 January 2014 included the following concerning the Applicant’s assault on Ms Walker (Annexure Z):
	


“Police told Ms Walker she was too intoxicated to make a statement at that time and to go home. They told McNeil to stay away from the unit until later that day. However, police had to be called again when he ignored their warning. McNeil was placed on a 12-month good behaviour bond for that assault.

Court documents reveal another victim was a female friend he met at a local RSL club. CCTV footage captured him grabbing her by the throat.

McNeil was arrested sitting in the RSL bar where he handed police a black-handled pocket knife from his pocket that he told them was for self-defence.”


	
	As mentioned earlier, a video clip of the Channel 7 “Sunrise” program in early January 2014 was played in Court (Annexure R). The item concerning the Applicant included the following discussion:
	


“Reporter: his alleged attacker 25 year old Shaun McNeil was refused bail yesterday in Parramatta local court yesterday, he apparently cried when that happened. That's not the state of mind he was in on New Year's Eve, the 25 year old was boasting to people that he was a mixed martial arts fighter, he allegedly punched four other people that night including Daniel Christie's brother who sustained a split lip.

Presenter: Is there any other background to the attacker, was he on a bond for similar offence?

Reporter: Yes he has been known to commit similar offences, he has also been held up for dishonesty arrests in the past, as well he does have a criminal history he has a history of violence also.

Presenter: Obviously huge parallels to Thomas Kelly's death. It supposed to be unprovoked, we read yesterday he was bending over to help someone else.

Reporter: That's right, four other people had been punched by allegedly been punched by Shaun McNeil that night, Daniel Christie and his brother was going to the aid of somebody else that had been punched. It was according to witnesses entirely unprovoked, it was a single closed fist to the face … There are parallels to Thomas Kelly's case in July 2012 the main difference in this case thought they caught the alleged attacker immediately. 

Presenter: let's hope the court system really comes through on this""


	
	The fictional Facebook page (mentioned at [52](d) above) contains comments, as does a website (Reddit Australia) where people post comments about particular topics (Annexures AG, AI, Daniel Covington affidavit, 30 January 2015; Annexure B, Daniel Covington affidavit, 9 March 2015). Examples of these are:
	


“Feed the coward to the pigs. This scum is doing min 10 years if not I’m starting a riot on the streets.” (11 January 2014)

Give him life in jail make the coward suffer. Death is the easy way out.” (12 January 2014)

“Fucking parasite loser piece of shit. Too scared to put his case to the people so hoping for some soft judge to let him off. Cunt.” (12 February 2015)


	
	Reference was made as well to the second reading speech for the Crimes Amendment (Intoxication) Bill 2014, which included the following comments by the Attorney General (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 26 February 2014):
	


“Then, on New Year’s Eve, Daniel Christie became the latest victim, fatally hit in Kings Cross, in the same street where Thomas Kelly was struck - in fact, very close to the spot where Thomas Kelly was struck. Daniel Christie died on 11 January. It is a quiet street and it has many trees that block camera vision, so no record of the assault was available. That assault emphasised to the people of this State the senselessness of the people who are full of drugs and/or alcohol when they start belting other people.”


	
	Adverse and sensational media publicity occurs from time to time in the context of cases which have achieved some notoriety. Spigelman CJ touched upon some of these in R v Jamal at 261 [16]:
	


“16    This Court has had occasion to assess adverse pre-trial publicity in a number of cases, being publicity of a character, of a duration and of an intensity which was at least equal, in many cases, to the publicity in the present case. Applications for a permanent stay have failed in the most sensational of cases: Anita Cobby, Ivan Milat, Phillip Bell, the Childers Backpacker Hostel fire, Lucy Dudko, William D’Arcy, Bruce Burrell. (See Murphy v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 94; R v Milat (Court of Criminal Appeal, 26 February 1998, unreported); R v Bell (Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 October 1998, unreported); Long v R [2002] QSC 54; (2002) 128 A Crim R 11; affirmed on appeal [2003] QCA 77; (2003) 138 A Crim R 103; R v Dudko [2002] NSWCCA 336; (2002) 132 A Crim R 371; R v D’Arcy [2003] QCA 124; (2003) 140 A Crim R 303; R v Burrell [2004] NSWCCA 185.)”


	
	The Chief Justice continued in R v Jamal, emphasising that the Courts “have decisively rejected the previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice”. The Chief Justice said at 261-262 [17]-[21]:
	


“17    I have had occasion to summarise the relevant case law in the following manner, applicable to the present case, in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324; (2004) 61 NSWLR 344:

‘[103]    There are now a significant number of cases in which the issue has arisen as to whether or not an accused was able to have a fair trial in the light of substantial media publicity, indeed publicity much more sensational and sustained than anything that occurred here. Those cases have decisively rejected the previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice. Trial judges of considerable experience have asserted, again and again, that jurors approach their task in accordance with the oath they take, that they listen to the directions that they are given and implement them. In particular that they listen to the direction that they are to determine guilt only on the evidence before them.’

18    There are now numerous judicial statements as to the validity of such an approach.

19    Going back, for example, as Gleeson CJ said in R v VPH (Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 March 1994, unreported) at 7: 

‘The jury will be given appropriate directions to confine their attention to the evidence that is put before them. Our entire system of the administration of criminal justice depends upon the assumption that jurors understand and comply with directions of that character.’ 

20    Furthermore, as McHugh JA said in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at 425:

‘[31] … Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials.’

21    The perspective that jurors properly perform their task, are true to their oaths and comply with a trial judge’s directions has repeatedly been applied in appellate courts over recent years. (See R v Milat; R v Bell; Long v R; R v Richards [1999] NSWCCA 114; (1999) 107 A Crim R 318; R v Dudko; R v D’Arcy; R v Burrell supra.)”


	
	The lapse of time between media publicity and the trial itself is a significant factor. In Montgomery v HM Advocate [2003] 1 AC 641, Lord Hope of Craighead said at 673:
	


“Recent research conducted for the New Zealand Law Commission suggests that the impact of pre-trial publicity and of prejudicial media coverage during the trial, even in high profile cases, is minimal: Young, Cameron & Tinsley, Juries in Criminal Trials: part Two, vol 1, ch 9, para 287 (New Zealand Law Commission preliminary paper no 37, November 1999). The lapse of time since the last exposure may increasingly be regarded, with each month that passes, in itself as some kind of a safeguard. Nevertheless the risk that the widespread, prolonged and prejudicial publicity that occurred in this case will have a residual effect on the minds of at least some members of the jury cannot be regarded as negligible. The principal safeguards of the objective impartiality of the tribunal lie in the trial process itself and the conduct of the trial by the trial judge. On the one hand there is the discipline to which the jury will be subjected of listening to and thinking about the evidence. The actions of seeing and hearing the witnesses may be expected to have a far greater impact on their minds than such residual recollections as may exist about reports about the case in the media. This impact can be expected to be reinforced on the other hand by such warnings and directions as the trial judge may think it appropriate to give them as the trial proceeds, in particular when he delivers his charge before they retire to consider their verdicts.""


	
	In Skaf v R [2008] NSWCCA 303, the Court of Criminal Appeal (McClellan CJ at CL, Hidden and Howie JJ) referred to the new dimension flowing from the internet in the area of media publicity. Their Honours said at [27]-[28]:
	


“27    The problem of publicity given to an alleged offence and the offender has been considered by the courts on many occasions. Sometimes the publicity has caused a court to defer a trial for a period. The assumption which the law makes is that the public’s memory of publicity will fade with time and accordingly after sufficient time, jurors will have no difficulty in confining their deliberations to the evidence. It is of course inevitable that there will be cases where, either because of the extent of the publicity, or, because of the peculiar or sensational nature of the facts, even if the public memory has subsided, when the evidence is tendered at a trial recollections of previous publicity will return. The internet has given a new dimension to these problems. Newspaper articles which provide an account of various events including allegations of criminal activity or a report of the evidence and verdict in criminal trials can now be retrieved, effectively forever. The law must accommodate these issues whilst ensuring a process which is fair both to the accused and the prosecution.

28    Apart from occasions when a trial is delayed to distance it from publicity, trial judges always tell jurors to confine their consideration to the evidence in the proceedings. If a trial has previously attracted or is likely to attract publicity, judges are careful to remind jurors that they are to ignore any publicity. The contemporary view is that it is not necessary for the jury to be sequestered with exposure to the media thereby eliminated. We accept that jurors will be faithful to the directions given by the trial judge and, if they happen upon a media discussion of the events, will be able to discriminate between the evidence and media reporting of the events.”


	
	Reference should be made at this point to s.68C Jury Act 1977, which provides:
	


“68C    Inquiries by juror about trial matters prohibited

(1)    A juror for the trial of any criminal proceedings must not make an inquiry for the purpose of obtaining information about the accused, or any matters relevant to the trial, except in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror.

Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both.

(2)    This section applies in respect of a juror from the time the juror is sworn in as a juror and until the juror, or the jury of which the juror is a member, is discharged by the court having conduct of the proceedings.

(3)    This section does not prohibit a juror:

(a)    from making an inquiry of the court, or of another member of the jury, in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror, or

(b)    from making an inquiry authorised by the court.

(4)    Anything done by a juror in contravention of a direction given to the jury by the judge in the criminal proceedings is not a proper exercise by the juror of his or her functions as a juror.

(5)    For the purpose of this section, making an inquiry includes the following:

(a)    asking a question of any person,

(b)    conducting any research, for example, by searching an electronic database for information (such as by using the Internet),

(c)    viewing or inspecting any place or object,

(d)    conducting an experiment,

(e)    causing someone else to make an inquiry.”


	
	In Skaf v R, their Honours returned to the internet, and the role of s.68C Jury Act 1977, at [46]:
	


“As indicated above the internet is an ongoing problem for the criminal justice system. The law has developed some strategies intended to deal with the situation. Model directions have been formulated following the decisions in R v K [2003] NSWCCA 406; (2003) 59 NSWLR 431 and R v Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37; (2004) 60 NSWLR 86 and s 68C Jury Act 1977 came into operation on 15 December 2004 prior to this trial. In her opening remarks to the jury the judge gave these directions. In his submissions to the trial judge on the stay application, counsel for Mohammed Skaf conceded ‘The concern is not publicity or what is is [sic] available on the Internet today because your Honour will give directions in relation to that. It is the publicity which is already out there and whether a direction at the start of the trial can remove that from the psyche of the jury as of today’.”


	
	The vast bulk of hard copy and electronic reporting of this case occurred in January, February and March 2014. There was some limited coverage in November 2014 of the fact that the Applicant had been committed for trial (Annexures Q, T, BB-BE, BQ-BS, Affidavit, Daniel Covington, 30 January 2015).
	
	
	The fictional Facebook page and the comments on the Reddit Australia site do not, in my view, loom large on the present application. The description given by Harrison J in R v Abrahams to similar material is apt to this matter (see [47] above).
	
	
	I accept that the publicity in the period January to March 2014 was very extensive and strong in content. It was prejudicial to the Applicant in a number of respects, including reference to his criminal history.
	
	
	The publication of the criminal history of an accused person or other adverse material about that person has, in the past, attracted the law of contempt: Attorney-General (NSW) v Willesee [1980] 2 NSWLR 143 at 149-151; Attorney General (NSW) v John Fairfax and Sons Limited (Court of Appeal, 21 April 1988, unreported, BC8802019); Attorney General (NSW) v John Fairfax and Sons Limited (Court of Appeal, 24 June 1988, unreported, BC8801793). Application of the Bread Manufacturers principle (Ex parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd; Re Truth and Sportsman Limited (1937) 37 SR NSW 242) has been accepted in contempt cases where matters of public interest are being discussed: Registrar of the Court of Appeal v Willesee (1985) 3 NSWLR 650; Attorney-General (NSW) v John Fairfax and Sons Limited and Bacon (1985) 6 NSWLR 695).
	
	
	However, publication on the internet of the criminal history of an accused person, and the fact that a jury member had knowledge of past convictions or of alleged criminal behaviour on the part of an accused person, is not regarded necessarily as being sufficient to establish bias: R v K [2003] NSWCCA 406; 59 NSWLR 431 at 446 [67]; R v King [2013] NSWSC 448; 228 A Crim R 406 at 417 [60].
	
	
	It is necessary to have regard, in particular, to the passage of time since the publications were made.
	
	
	As was said in Skaf v R at [27] (see [67 above]), the age of the internet means that what was once newspaper, television and radio coverage that faded in time, could now see the very same articles and programs electronically available via the internet.
	
	
	I do not consider that the media publicity, as strong as it was, is a decisive consideration in circumstances where some 14 months would have passed between the end of that phase in March 2014 (subject to limited coverage of the committal proceedings) and the commencement of the trial in late May 2015.
	
	
	The circumstances of current concern relate to:
	



	
	whether members of the jury panel may engage in any electronic searching with respect to the Applicant prior to the time when a jury is empanelled; and
	
	
	whether the jury as empanelled may engage in electronic searching.
	



	
	The short answer to the second area is that the jury as selected will have passed through a process, prior to empanelment, where it may be expected that the trial Judge will explore this issue and any difficulty that potential jurors may have in fairly determining the case: R v Stanley at [35]. The empanelled jury will be subject to s.68C Jury Act 1977, and directions which the trial Judge will give during the trial itself. As the Court of Criminal Appeal observed in Skaf v R at [46] (see [69] above), the existence of s.68C, and the giving of judicial directions to the jury, constitute an appropriate response to the second area of concern.
	
	
	As Basten JA (Bathurst CJ and Whealy JA agreeing) observed in Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand Pty Limited v Ibrahim [2012] NSWCCA 125; 83 NSWLR 52 at 69-70 [62]-[63]:
	


“62   The obligation of a juror, encapsulated in the oath or affirmation, is to ‘give a true verdict according to the evidence’: Jury Act 1977 (NSW), s 72A. It is an offence for a juror to ‘make an inquiry for the purpose of obtaining information about the accused, or any matters relevant to the trial, except in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror’: s 68C(1). The words ‘making an inquiry’ include conducting any electronic search of a database for information: s 68C(5)(b). That language extends to ‘causing someone else to make an inquiry’: s 68C(5)(e). The standard direction given to juries at the beginning of a trial covers that negative obligation. 

63   These provisions demonstrate the impropriety of a juror obtaining information outside the course of the trial, which might potentially affect his or her view of matters in issue during the trial.”


	
	The first area of concern (at [78](a)) gives rise to different considerations. Is there a realistic prospect that members of the public, who may be on the jury panel, will conduct electronic searches concerning the Applicant between now and the time of the trial?
	
	
	It is difficult to see that any recent or current event would be likely to trigger electronic searching of that type.
	
	
	It may be said that members of the jury panel might consider such an enquiry if there is some media publicity of the forthcoming trial of the Applicant. Is there any step which the Court may take to allay concerns which may arise in this respect in accordance with what was said in R v Stanley at [43] (see [39] above)?
	
	
	An approach which is open to the Court is to make an order prohibiting publication of the pending trial of the Applicant, with such an order to remain in place until such time as the trial Judge has made any other order once the trial is underway. This may be accompanied by a pseudonym order so that the Applicant’s name will not appear in the Court list. Orders of this type may operate to prevent media publicity itself becoming a trigger to electronic searching by members of the community, who may be members of the jury panel.
	
	
	I am satisfied that a combination of steps may be taken to guard against the impact of previous adverse media publicity in the circumstances of this case. I do not consider that the media publicity requires, in the interests of justice, an order for trial by Judge alone in this case.
	
	
	It will be necessary to consider the discretionary question posed by s.132(4) and (5) by reference to the cumulative assessment of issues raised in support of the application. For the moment, however, the critical aspect of the application based on adverse media publicity does not, in my view, lead to an order for trial by Judge alone.
	


The Intention Issue

Overview of Submissions


	
	Mr Smith SC outlined the way in which intention would be an issue in the trial. If the Crown established that it was the Applicant who struck a blow to the head of Daniel Christie then, before a conviction for murder could result, it would be necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant struck Daniel Christie with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm: s.18(1) Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	Mr Smith SC advanced a submission that intention did not fall within s.132(5). He relied upon certain authority in support of this proposition, and submitted that other cases which had found to the contrary ought not be followed.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the intention of the Applicant when striking Daniel Christie was an issue in the trial, and that the determination of whether he had an intention to do grievous bodily harm will require the application of community standards. The Crown referred to authority in support of this proposition.
	


Decision Concerning Intention Issue


	
	The starting point on this issue is strong obiter dicta of Heydon J in AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438 at 472-473 [95]. In the course of providing other examples of factual issues requiring the application of “objective community standards” in s.118(6) Criminal Procedure Act 2004 (WA). Heydon J referred to the question “whether an accused person had a particular intention”. Gummow and Hayne JJ at 451-452 [38] agreed generally with the reasons of Heydon J.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal, and single Judges, have considered the role of intention in s.132(5). Mr Smith SC relied upon passages in R v Belghar at 24-26 [90]-[100] and in the decisions of Harrison J in R v Abrahams at 96-97 [71]-[77] and of Hamill J in R v Simmons; R v Moore (No. 4) at [61]-[66].
	
	
	The Crown referred to passages in R v Stanley at [56]-[61], R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661 at [58]-[59] and of Bellew J in R v King at 415-416 [48]-[53].
	
	
	In my view, the intention issue in this case may be characterised as one involving application of objective community standards: AK v Western Australia at 473 [95]; R v Stanley at [55]-[59]; R v King at 415-416 [48]-[53]; R v Dean at [58].
	
	
	In the present case, the question which arises is whether, if the Crown establishes that the Applicant struck Daniel Christie, whether he did so with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. An assessment of this issue will involve an examination of all the evidence bearing upon that question and the drawing of inferences, if the evidence permits to the criminal standard. Directions concerning the drawing of inferences, for the purpose of determining an issue of intention are common directions in criminal trials, including a murder trial.
	
	
	I have no difficulty in characterising an assessment as to intention in a criminal trial such as the present as being a matter falling within s.132(5). I have observed earlier that the absence of the word “intention” in s.132(5) provides limited assistance to the Applicant’s argument. The provision is non-exhaustive and, in a context such as this, may readily accommodate an issue of intention.
	
	
	The fact that this issue would fall for consideration by 12 persons as opposed to one person, a Judge, is a factor which operates in favour of the jury being the tribunal of fact in this case.
	
	
	Having regard to the indication by senior counsel for the Applicant that there would be no live issue in the trial concerning dangerousness with respect to the statutory alternative of manslaughter, I do not consider it necessary to address that issue on this application.
	


The Credibility Issue


	
	This issue may be dealt with relatively briefly.
	
	
	Mr Smith SC submitted that, as with intention, credibility was not a term used in s.132(5) and it could not fall within the concept of objective community standards for that purpose. Submissions were advance by reference to a number of authorities.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the credibility of witnesses, and evidence generally, was a matter which fell within s.132(5) so that it could be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether an order for trial by Judge alone should be made.
	


Decision Concerning Credibility Issue


	
	It is true that the word credibility does not appear within s.132(5).
	
	
	Where the credibility of witnesses arises as an issue in the trial, in my view this factor may operate in favour of a jury trial. This is so whether an assessment of credibility involves application of objective community standards or not. Such a trial will involve 12 members of the public (as opposed to one Judge) bringing their experience to bear in determining if the witnesses are giving credible and reliable evidence.
	
	
	Like Latham J in R v Dean at [59], I would call in aid the statement of Lord Devlin in Trial by Jury (1966), page 140, cited by Heydon J in AK v Western Australia at 472 [94]:
	


“Secondly, Lord Devlin also saw juries as being superior to judges in assessing credibility [78]: 

‘[T]he jury is the best instrument for deciding upon the credibility or reliability of a witness and so for determining the primary facts. Whether a person is telling the truth, when it has to be judged, as so often it has, simply from the demeanour of the witness and his manner of telling it, is a matter about which it is easy for a single mind to be fallible. The impression that a witness makes depends upon reception as well as transmission and may be affected by the idiosyncrasies of the receiving mind; the impression made upon a mind of twelve is more reliable. Moreover, the judge, who naturally by his training regards so much as simple that to the ordinary man may be difficult, may fail to make enough allowance for the behaviour of the stupid. The jury hear the witness as one who is as ignorant as they are of lawyers' ways of thought; that is the great advantage to a man of judgment by his peers’.”


	
	Insofar as it would seem that there are issues as to the credibility on the part of witnesses to be called in the Applicant’s trial, in my view this factor may be taken into account in support of retaining the s.131 procedure of trial by jury.
	


Conclusion


	
	I have had regard to all factors bearing upon the exercise of discretion under s.132(4) as identified in this judgment.
	
	
	For reasons expressed earlier, I do not accept the Applicant’s submission that the interests of justice call for a Judge-alone trial in this case. The substantial adverse publicity with respect to the Applicant will be significantly remote in time by 25 May 2015. Steps may be taken, between now and the commencement of the trial, to avoid any public trigger which may lead to members of the public (including the jury panel) engaging in electronic searching concerning the Applicant. The processes involved in the empanelment of a jury and the directions which the trial Judge will give, together with the operation of s.68C Jury Act 1977, will allow the Applicant to receive a fair trial by a jury comprising members of the public exercising an important role in the administration of criminal justice.
	
	
	The additional arguments advanced on the application by reference to the issues of intention and credibility do not advance the Applicant’s case for an order for trial by Judge alone.
	
	
	In my opinion, it is not in the interests of justice to make an order for trial by Judge alone in this case.
	
	
	The Applicant’s Notice of Motion filed 30 January 2015 should be dismissed.
	
	
	As foreshadowed earlier in this judgment, I am satisfied, for the purpose of s.8(1)(a) Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010, that an order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice with that order being to the effect that there be no publication of the listing of the Applicant’s trial, nor any publication of the name of the Applicant, with those orders to remain in place until such time as a different order is made by the trial Judge.
	
	
	Accordingly, I make the following orders:
	



	
	the Applicant’s Notice of Motion filed 30 January 2015 is dismissed;
	
	
	I order that there be no publication of the listing of the Applicant’s trial;
	
	
	I order that there be no publication of the name of the Applicant, with the trial of the Applicant to be described in any court list as “R v AA”;
	
	
	Orders (b) and (c) above are to remain in force until such time as a different order is made by the trial Judge;
	
	
	I order that there be no publication of this judgment or of the evidence and submissions made on the application for Judge-alone trial, until such further order of the Court as may be made after completion of the trial.
	



	
	I will request the Court’s Media Manager to bring these orders and this judgment to the attention of the media and I vary the above non-publication orders to allow this process to occur.

		12 June 2015",2015-04-01 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2424560,R v Aller (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 402,"reasons for LIMITING TERM


	
	On 31 July 2012, the accused, Michael John Aller, killed a woman with whom he had been in a relationship for a short time, Amy Aiton, by stabbing her repeatedly with a kitchen knife after an argument.
	
	
	He was charged with the murder of Ms Aiton but, because of mental illness, was unfit to stand trial. At a special hearing, pursuant to s 19 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I found that on the limited material available he was not guilty of murder but that he had committed the crime of manslaughter. It is now my task to nominate a limiting term of imprisonment, as required by s 23(1)(b) of that Act. That term must be my best estimate of the sentence which would have been appropriate if the accused had been found guilty of manslaughter at a normal trial. Apart from the fact that I cannot set a non-parole period, I must apply relevant sentencing principles.
	
	
	I found that the killing amounted to manslaughter rather than murder because the partial defence of substantial impairment, under s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900, had been made out. I was satisfied that at the time of the killing the accused’s capacity to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition. That condition was described by a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Furst, as the prodromal presentation of a schizophrenic illness.
	
	
	The facts of the offence, the background to it, and the psychiatric evidence are summarised in the reasons I gave for my verdict: R v Aller [2015] NSWSC 178, and need not be repeated.
	
	
	As I recorded in those reasons, the accused stabbed Ms Aiton many times in what was a sustained and ferocious attack. The extent and severity of her injuries were described by the forensic pathologist, Dr Allen Cala, in a detailed post-mortem report. It is sufficient to quote the following passage from it:
	


“There were so many wounds to the chest in particular that a description of each individual wound track was not possible.

The amount of force required to cause the stab wounds is unknown however given that a number of ribs were completely stabbed through in the upper back, it follows that large or severe force would have been required at some stage to produce these injuries by stabbing through bone.

The attack was sustained over possibly several minutes and was clearly of a very violent nature. The order of infliction of the stab wounds is not possible to ascertain with certainty. The deceased nevertheless attempted to defend herself by the presence of “defence” injuries on both arms and hands. These were sharp force injuries, caused by parrying or thwarting an attacker wielding a sharp object such as a knife. This indicates the deceased must have been alert and conscious enough at the time and tried to defend herself. Some of these defence wounds were very deep and would have been associated with rapid and large blood loss.”


	
	Nobody in Ms Aiton’s position would have been able to ward off such an attack, but she was particularly vulnerable to it because of physical injuries she had suffered. I referred briefly in my reasons for verdict to the fact that she had been injured in a car accident. This was a very bad accident which occurred in 2004. She suffered a serious brain injury, causing paralysis on the left side of her body, for which she had to undergo long term treatment. While she made substantial progress, she was still affected by her condition at the time of her death. In particular, she had not regained the use of her left arm. The accused, of course, was aware of her condition. In the recorded police interview he said that she “could walk OK, but not much in her left hand … or left arm.”
	
	
	I also referred in my reasons for verdict to the accused’s background, his history of alcohol abuse and his propensity to domestic violence. His criminal history includes a number of entries for offences of violence, contravening apprehended violence orders and using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend. I have the facts of a number of those offences, committed in a domestic context.
	
	
	In April 2009, he was dealt with for a number of offences, committed between September and October 2008, against a woman to whom I shall refer as Danielle. It seems that he had been in a relationship with her, but at the relevant time it had broken down. Put shortly, these were offences conveniently referred to as telecommunication offences (using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend) and contravening apprehended violence orders. They disclose a pattern of behaviour whereby the accused left numerous phone messages for Danielle, either by voicemail or text, which were harassing, intimidating or sexually degrading. Some of these messages led to an apprehended violence order, but they continued thereafter. Some of those later messages were conciliatory, but were still in breach of a condition of the order prohibiting any contact with her. Other breaches occurred by his abusing her in the street, going to her home at night, and behaving in a threatening manner outside her home. On yet another occasion he smashed the lounge room window of her home with a rock, giving rise to a charge of malicious damage. There was a further telecommunication offence, when he rang her father to convey threats to her.
	
	
	At the time of some of these offences he was intoxicated. For all the offences he was given a suspended sentence of 12 months, with a bond to be of good behaviour for the same period.
	
	
	The remaining offences were committed against a woman whom I shall call Beth. She was the woman with whom the accused formed a relationship at a later stage, to whom I referred at [11] in my reasons for verdict. As I noted, in the recorded police interview he admitted having assaulted her in 2011. This was an incident which occurred in September 2011 at an RSL club when, apparently after a disagreement of some kind, he punched her in the face, causing facial injuries. He was arrested that day and police obtained an interim apprehended domestic violence order. A few days later, in breach of that order, he phoned Beth and threatened to harm himself if she did not take him back or end the legal action against him. He was on bail for both of these offences at the time of the manslaughter. In September 2012, while in custody, he was dealt with for them in a Local Court and sentenced to a short term of imprisonment.
	
	
	In my reasons for verdict I recounted the fact that the accused had spent time at Miracle Haven Rehabilitation Centre before he began his relationship with Ms Aiton. It was his arrest for the offences committed against Beth which led to his admission to that centre, following a referral under the Magistrate’s Early Referral Into Treatment (MERIT) Program. The statement of a caseworker at Miracle Haven, Mark Gambrill, reveals that his behaviour and progress while at the centre were satisfactory. However, he left the program about 2 months before its completion, telling Mr Gambrill that he did not believe he was going to “get any more from being here.” Mr Gambrill described that decision as “out of the blue” to him. Nevertheless, a report of Ms Jessica Knight, caseworker with the MERIT program, of January 2012 certified him as having successfully completed the program and recommended that his legal matters proceed without any further involvement in it.
	
	
	I received victim impact statements from Ms Aiton’s mother, Debbie Roberts, her father, Allan Aiton, her grandmother, Yvonne Griggs, and her step-father, Christopher Horwood. Ms Roberts and Mr Horwood read their statements in court. The statements of Mr Aiton and Ms Griggs were read by a member of the Homicide Victim Support Group. All of them were deeply moving, expressing their grief and outrage at Ms Aiton’s violent and untimely death. I also received photos of Ms Aiton, as a child and as an adult.
	
	
	She was only 31 years old at the time of her death. Undoubtedly, it is dreadful that such a young life should be extinguished in that brutal and senseless manner. I well understand the pain and loss which those family members continue to experience. I expressed my deepest sympathy to them during the sentence proceedings, and I do so again now. The Crown prosecutor submitted that I should exercise my discretion under s 28(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to take those statements into account in determining the limiting term. Beyond reference to the terms of the subsection he did not develop that submission, and I do not consider it appropriate to take that course in this case.
	
	
	Manslaughter, being the unlawful killing of a person, is an inherently serious offence. Nevertheless, it is one which can embrace a very wide variety and degree of criminality. This case falls into the more serious category of that crime. So much is apparent from the nature of the accused’s attack upon Ms Aiton. The Crown prosecutor submitted that I should find that he intended to kill her. I am not so satisfied. However, there is force in the Crown prosecutor’s submission that, in the circumstances of this offence, whether he intended to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm makes little difference to its objective criminality. While his consumption of alcohol on the day in question was not decisive of the issue of substantial impairment, I accept that it was a factor in his behaviour. That in no way excuses his conduct. Moreover, as the Crown prosecutor rightly pointed out, he was a man with a history of domestic violence when he was affected by alcohol and must be taken to have been aware of his propensity for violence in that state. Indeed, as I have said, he was on bail for offences involving domestic violence at the time. That breach of conditional liberty, of course, is also an aggravating feature to which I must have regard in arriving at the limiting term.
	
	
	My decision that the killing should be characterised as manslaughter rather than murder entails a finding that it was the product of the substantial impairment of the accused’s capacity to control himself at the time, that impairment arising from the mental condition identified by Dr Furst. Nevertheless, while accepting that that impairment was substantial, the extent to which his actions were affected by his mental condition remains an issue in determining the appropriate limiting term: cf R v Keceski (CCA, unreported, 10 August 1993), per Mahony JA at pp 10-11. In R v Cooper (CCA, unreported, 24 February 1998), a case dealing with the defence then known as diminished responsibility, Gleeson CJ (at p 24) observed in relation to sentence for manslaughter on that basis that “each case turns on its own facts, and the type of abnormality of mind and impairment of responsibility involved may vary greatly.”
	
	
	Section 23A of the Crimes Act envisages the impairment of an accused’s capacity to understand events, or to judge whether his or her actions were right or wrong, as well as the capacity for self control. As the Crown prosecutor pointed out, there is no suggestion in the present case of any diminution of the accused’s capacity to understand events or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong. The defence rested only on his capacity to control himself. Moreover, as I have said, alcohol made some contribution to his behaviour on this occasion. In the circumstances, I am persuaded by the Crown prosecutor’s submission that the degree of impairment here was not significantly greater than that necessary to make out the defence. Accordingly, the accused’s moral culpability was not markedly diminished.
	
	
	On the other hand, as Mr Bruce submitted, the killing was spontaneous. The knife happened to be in the bedroom, as Ms Aiton kept it on her bedside table for the purpose of cleaning her bong. Mr Bruce also pointed out that, on the accused’s account in the police interview, Ms Aiton made some provocative remarks in the heat of the argument. I accept that but, given the ferocity of the accused’s reaction, he can derive no comfort from it.
	
	
	I believe that the accused’s account to police in the recorded interview was frank and unvarnished. In my reasons for verdict, at [24], I noted that he expressed remorse for his crime. At [34] I recorded that he had also done so to mental health professionals while in custody. This included his expressing regret after his suicide attempts that he was still alive, and I accept Mr Bruce’s submission that those attempts were driven, at least in part, by his remorse. In the light of this material, I accept his expressions of remorse as genuine.
	
	
	In a letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions of 3 July 2013, the accused’s Legal Aid solicitor conveyed his willingness to plead guilty to manslaughter if the charge of murder were withdrawn. The Director declined to take that course. Mr Bruce relied upon that letter, the accused’s admissions to police about his conduct from the outset, and the fact that the proceedings were conducted only on the issue of substantial impairment, to found a submission that the accused was entitled to a reduction of the limiting term on the basis that he had sought to facilitate the administration of justice: s 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	On the face of it, the letter is problematic because it appears to convey an offer to plead guilty to manslaughter by an accused who was unfit to be tried and, accordingly, not in a position to make such a decision. However, Mr Bruce explained that over a period the accused’s fitness to stand trial had fluctuated. As he put it, he was “in and out of fitness.” A report of Dr Furst of 8 November 2013, exhibit 3, noted that the accused’s “overall understanding of his legal situation and capacity to participate in a trial has deteriorated over recent weeks … .” Mr Bruce conveyed his instructions that in July 2013, when the letter was forwarded to the Director, he was fit.
	
	
	This I accept. Further, the prerequisites of s 22A are also met by the accused’s surrender to police, his early admissions, and the focused way in which the proceedings have been conducted. On this issue I would respectfully adopt the approach of Campbell J in R v Peterson (No 5) [2014] NSWSC 1080 at [12]-[13], [17].
	
	
	Taking all the circumstances into account, but for the reduction of sentence to which the accused is entitled under s 22A, I would have nominated a limiting term of imprisonment for 14 years. In the light of his facilitation of the administration of justice, I would reduce that term by 15%. This produces a term of a little under 12 years, which I would round down to 11 ½ years. Accordingly, I nominate a limiting term of 11 ½ years, to date from the day the accused was taken into custody, 1 August 2012. I shall consult the parties about the orders to be made under s 24(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act.
	


Orders


	
	Limiting term of 11 years & 6 months to date from 1 August 2012.
	
	
	Under s 24 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 I refer Mr Aller to the Mental Health Review Tribunal in light of the limiting term I have nominated. I order that he be held in custody in an appropriate correctional centre until further assessment by the Tribunal.

		10 April 2015",2015-04-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2424608,El-Ahmad v R [2015] NSWCCA 65,"Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Mouna El-Ahmad (“the applicant”) was sentenced by his Honour Judge Bennett SC in the District Court at Parramatta on 2 May 2014 to a term of imprisonment for 5 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years to date from 14 June 2012.
	
	
	This was an aggregate sentence imposed in respect of offences of supplying a commercial quantity of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (commonly known as ""nexus"") (""the commercial supply offence"") and supplying methylamphetamine on three or more separate occasions for financial or material reward (""the ongoing supply offence""). The learned judge indicated that if not for the imposition of an aggregate sentence he would have imposed a sentence of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months for the commercial supply offence and a sentence of 3 years for the ongoing supply offence.
	
	
	The commercial supply offence is contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and the ongoing supply offence is contrary to s 25A(1) of the same Act. They each have a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and/or a fine of $385,000. The commercial supply offence also has a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to rely upon six grounds of appeal. I am satisfied that three of the grounds have been made good, leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be allowed and that the applicant should be re-sentenced.
	


Facts


	
	There was a statement of agreed facts tendered at the sentence hearing and I draw the following from it.
	
	
	A police investigation identified the applicant and Alan (""Alex"") Chew as being persons of interest in the supply of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	On 23 April 2012, after a number of discussions involving undercover police officers, the applicant and another person called either Sam Awood or Zackaria Gomrawi, the applicant supplied the officers with 64.9 grams of nexus in return for payment of $1600. It appears from the facts that the applicant was the initial contact point for the officers; she took them to Awood who discussed quantities and price with them; and she later delivered the drugs and received payment. She is recorded as having said things to the officer that conveyed that Awood was a regular source of drugs.
	
	
	The prescribed commercial quantity for this drug is 25 grams (the large commercial quantity is 100 grams). According to the statement of facts, nexus is commonly purported to be ecstasy but it has a stronger hallucinogenic effect, whereas ecstasy provides a stimulant effect.
	
	
	On 30 May 2012, the applicant met with the officers and supplied them with 2.27 grams of methylamphetamine (""ice"") with a purity of 38 per cent in exchange for $800. In her recorded conversation on this occasion she spoke of ""bagging up"" yesterday when she ""threw"" half a gram on the floor; that she was looking at ""eleven hundred for an eight ball""; and generally conveyed the impression that this was not a one-off transaction for her.
	
	
	On 4 June, one of the officers met up with the applicant at Granville. She made a telephone call to a co-offender, Alex Chew. After she spoke with him she put one of the officers on the phone and he spoke with Chew. At Chew's direction the applicant and the officer went to a location in St Marys where they met Chew and an unknown male. Chew supplied the officer with 6.9 grams of ice with a purity of 59.5% for a price of $2000.
	
	
	On 12 June, the applicant facilitated a supply of 6.84 grams of ice (71% purity) by Chew to the officer. She did so via communications with each of them. She was not present at the transaction but Chew mentioned to the officer that he would ""fix up"" the applicant for her share in the deal.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested on 14 June 2012. For some reason she was not interviewed until 24 July 2012. She told police that she and Chew had an agreement whereby she introduced customers to him for drug supply in exchange for which he would reduce the amount of a debt she owed him and occasionally receive a gram of ice for her personal use.
	


The applicant's personal circumstances


	
	The applicant was 35 years old at the time of the offences. She had a lengthy criminal history commencing in 2001 but involving mainly dishonesty and driving offences from 2009 onwards. At the time of the present offences she was subject to multiple suspended Drug Court sentences, a recognizance under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and a s 9 good behaviour bond. The suspension of the Drug Court sentences was revoked and she was called up in respect of the recognizance and the bond and resentenced. By the time she came before Bennett DCJ she was subject to an overall term of imprisonment of 3 years 4 months dating from 9 October 2011 with the non-parole component of 2 years having expired on 8 October 2013.
	
	
	The offences the subject of the suspended Drug Court sentences were: goods in custody (committed 29.4.09); driving whilst disqualified (12.9.10); obtain money by deception (2 counts with 7 more taken into account) (20-28.11.09); use false instrument with intent (20.11.09); driving whilst suspended (10.11.09); goods in custody (7.12.09); obtaining money by deception (15.12.09); goods in custody (2 counts) (20.7.11); driving whilst disqualified (20.7.11); and publish false or misleading material to obtain property (5.2.11).
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings but tendered on her behalf were reports by Dr Antonella Ventura, psychiatrist; Clara Fritchley, psychologist; Justice Health medical records; certificates attesting to the completion of courses; and a handwritten letter by the applicant.
	
	
	Dr Ventura's report included that the applicant was a single woman with three children who had been removed from her care. Her partner had been imprisoned for drug and firearm offences and she had been staying with a friend of his, Sam, who was a drug dealer (Sam Awood or Zakaria Gomrawi). Sam instructed her to transport some pills to a customer and to collect the purchase money. She felt she had to do this as she had nowhere to go. She also claimed generally that she was selling drugs to get drugs for herself; she had been abusing drugs, particularly ice, for about 18 years.
	
	
	The applicant gave Dr Ventura a history of experiencing drug-induced psychosis on a number of occasions in the past and there was support for this in the medical records. She also had a history of severe Crohn's disease and significant iron deficiency anaemia. Medical records indicated that she had undergone bowel resection surgery. She also suffered from seizures. Dr Ventura was unable to verify a claim of having bowel cancer.
	
	
	The applicant told Dr Ventura that she commenced using drugs following an arranged marriage when she was sent to Lebanon at the age of 13. Both of her parents died not long after. Her husband physically abused her and supplied her with drugs. She left him and entered into relationships with other abusive men. She attributed most of her criminal offending to substance abuse. She candidly told Dr Ventura that she had used drugs since coming into custody. She was not willing to go on a methadone program.
	
	
	Dr Ventura made the diagnosis of ""stimulant use disorder in sustained remission in a controlled environment"". She considered that this contributed to her offending: she needed to obtain drugs no matter the detrimental consequences; her drug abuse placed her at risk of entering abusive relationships or being homeless; she relied on a man who was a drug dealer; and she was strongly driven to comply by the dealer's request. (It seems that Dr Ventura was only aware of the commercial supply offence.)
	
	
	The applicant expressed a motivation to stop abusing drugs but Dr Ventura considered that, in the light of her history, her potential for recidivism was high. She considered the applicant needed extensive drug rehabilitation treatment.
	
	
	The report of Ms Fritchley set out the applicant's history in somewhat more detail. It included circumstances of her upbringing which was marred by physical abuse by her brothers and being sexually assaulted at a young age, a subject she was not willing to expand upon. Her schooling ended prior to high school because of her going to Lebanon at the age of 13 and marrying her cousin. She had her first child at the age of 19 and returned to Australia at that time. She separated from her husband when she was 28. The children had been removed and placed in foster care but ran away. Her former husband sent the eldest two to Lebanon to prevent them being again removed but she maintained contact with them. Her youngest daughter lived with her niece in Sydney and she had occasional contact with her.
	
	
	Ms Fritchley also considered that the applicant needed a structured long term drug rehabilitation program which would also have a focus on her ""fragile mental health"".
	


The sentencing judgment


	
	At an early stage of his sentencing remarks the judge referred to the applicant having pleaded guilty on the day her trial was listed to commence in the District Court. He also said that the Crown had accepted that in those circumstances a discount of 25 per cent could be allowed, and his Honour cited R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1. The Crown’s concession was clearly wrong and it is surprising that his Honour accepted it. R v Borkowski at [31] (Howie J) is authority for the proposition that it will be an exceptional case in which a discount of 25 per cent would be allowed for a plea entered following committal to the District Court.
	
	
	The judge then indicated that the applicant had been held in custody and so the sentence would be backdated to the date of her arrest, 14 June 2012. (His Honour had been informed that she was serving a sentence for other matters as indicated in the criminal history before him and he indicated a number of times during the proceedings on sentence that there should be some measure of accumulation.)
	
	
	The judge recited the facts of the offences at some length before turning to the applicant's personal circumstances. He rejected the claim to Dr Ventura that she committed the commercial supply offence because she had nowhere else to go. He did, however, accept that supplying drugs gave her the means to acquire drugs for her own use. The judge referred to other aspects of the report, and the Justice Health records, including the history of drug-induced psychosis; severe Crohn's disease and anaemia; extensive history of drug abuse; and her family and relationship history.
	
	
	His Honour noted the time lapse between reports of Ms Fritchley (28 July 2012) and Dr Ventura (3 April 2014) and considered that the apparent improvement in the applicant's presentation as described by the two authors may be attributable to progress she had made since being in custody and largely away from the influence of drugs.
	
	
	Reference was made to the applicant’s experience with Crohn’s disease, including having to undergo bowel surgery. His Honour accepted that she required ongoing care and monitoring and that it would “impact upon the burden she suffers whilst in custody”.
	
	
	In relation to the offences themselves, the judge considered that in relation to the ongoing supply offence the applicant was ""a significant participant facilitating the purposes of those with whom she was engaged"".
	
	
	The judge considered that the applicant's record and the fact the offences were committed whilst she was on conditional liberty were aggravating factors.
	
	
	The principle of totality of criminality was referred to with the judge indicating that there would have to be some accumulation between the sentences.
	
	
	Special circumstances were found to exist (by reason of the Crohn's disease) justifying a reduction of the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period: s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	The judge said he was not prepared to find that the applicant was remorseful, or that there were prospects of rehabilitation ""in light of the history she has exhibited so far"". He confirmed, however, that he had taken into account the applicant's unfortunate background and her history of illness and drug abuse.
	
	
	His Honour then referred to the sentencing of Alan Chew and Sam Awood. This is relevant to one of the grounds of appeal and more will be said about it later.
	
	
	After announcing the aggregate sentence and the indicative sentences, the judge indicated that he had found the commercial supply offence ""below the mid-range of objective seriousness"".
	


Ground 1 - The learned judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending


	
	The focus of this ground was the following passage in the sentencing judgment (page 25):
	


""The Crown concedes that the offender was a facilitator in the enterprise in which she participated. The Crown correctly submits these are serious offences; she reminds me of the commercial quantity specified for these offences as 100 grams; she concedes that the offence, in each instance, fall below mid-range; she acknowledges that the man Awood was involved in greater criminality but only to a marginal extent.

With regard to the ongoing supply the offender had control of and responsibility for the delivery of the drugs and in that role she was what might be seen to be a significant participant facilitating the purposes of those with whom she was engaged."" (Emphasis added)


	
	Counsel for the applicant contended that this revealed errors in the judge's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	The judge misstated that the Crown Prosecutor had said the commercial quantity ""for these offences"" was 100 grams. In fact, the Crown Prosecutor had said (correctly) in relation to nexus that the “total weight of those pills your Honour was 64.9 grams which is more than double the commercial quantity, the commercial quantity being 25 grams. The large commercial quantity is 100 grams.” (POS 25.26) (The commercial quantity for methylamphetamine is 250 grams.)
	
	
	It was also incorrect to say that the applicant ""had control of and responsibility for the delivery of the drugs"" in the ongoing supply offence. That could only be said in relation to the first transaction; it was Chew who physically supplied the drugs in the other transactions and the applicant was not even present at the last.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant also submitted that another error was a failure to have regard to six features pointing towards a lower level of seriousness of the ongoing supply offence. He also contended that there was error in giving undue weight to the fact that the offences were committed for financial reward (modest in relation to the commercial supply offence and an element of the ongoing supply offence).
	
	
	The Crown's response was to point to the fact that the judge made no assessment of where within the range of objective seriousness the ongoing supply offence fell and in relation to the commercial supply offence he merely indicated that it was below the mid-range. It was submitted that the findings made by the judge were open to him and that no House error (House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499) was evident.
	
	
	In the passage extracted from the sentencing remarks above, the judge was speaking of matters that were relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences. He was clearly mistaken in relation to at least the two matters referred to above (at [38]-[39]). Nothing appears to turn on the mistake about the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	His Honour explicitly stated a finding that the commercial supply offence was below the mid-range and it may be inferred that he accepted the Crown’s concession that the ongoing supply offence was as well. But he did not say anything to indicate the extent to which he found them to be below that level of seriousness. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the errors were insignificant in his Honour's assessment of objective seriousness.
	
	
	These errors are sufficient to uphold this ground. It is unnecessary to deal with the other errors asserted.
	


Ground 2 - The learned judge erred in his assessment of the subjective features of the applicant


	
	The judge expressed some circumspection about certain aspects of the applicant's subjective case but the applicant's counsel acknowledged that ""he did appear to accept that the applicant's subjective features were unfortunate"". It was submitted that, nevertheless, ""it appears that very little weight was given to these subjective features on sentence"". This was said to be because he gave undue weight to the failure of the applicant to give evidence. It was also submitted that his Honour gave disproportionate weight to the applicant's criminal history on the basis that reference to it occupied four pages of the transcript of his Honour's sentencing remarks.
	
	
	The judge did not explicitly say how much ""weight"" he gave to the applicant's subjective features (as is to be expected). It is implicit in the submissions that he gave some weight to them. How much, and whether it was appropriate and open to his Honour, can only be measured by examining the sentence itself. Error having been identified under Ground 1, that exercise has become otiose.
	
	
	As to the complaint about reference to the applicant's criminal history, the short answer is that the weight given to a particular matter in a judgment usually cannot be measured by the number of words a judge chooses or needs to use in referring to it. Some matters require lengthy exposition but ultimately have little weight whilst others can be stated quite pithily but have substantial weight. For example, it did not take the judge very long to refer to the applicant's plea of guilty but it brought about a 25 per cent reduction in her sentence. There is no merit in this complaint.
	


Ground 3 - The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give appropriate weight to the finding of special circumstances


	
	Special circumstances were found but the sentence entailed a non-parole period that is 73 per cent of the head sentence. Put another way, the finding of special circumstances resulted in a reduction of the non-parole period by about 6 weeks from what it otherwise would have been.
	
	
	The Crown points to the judge having said that the non-parole period was ""the least to which I believe she should be exposed in the circumstances"" and that the parole period was ""adequate to assist in her rehabilitation and re-socialisation back into the community"". But that is to ignore that his Honour found special circumstances expressly and solely ""by reason of the Crohn's disease"" and that he had earlier referred to how debilitating that disease is and how it would render the applicant's custodial conditions more onerous.
	
	
	Gleeson JA recently collected authorities relevant to a ground such as this in MD v R [2015] NSWCCA 37 at [38]-[43] and it is unnecessary to restate them. As the Crown submits, a finding of special circumstances is discretionary and this Court will be slow to intervene in relation to such judgments made at first instance. However, it rather makes a mockery (to adopt the expression of Howie J in R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [30]) of finding special circumstances to reduce the non-parole period of a total term of 5 years 6 months by only 6 weeks. In my view, the discretion has miscarried.
	
	
	Error is established under this ground.
	


Ground 4 - The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity between the sentence imposed upon her and her co-offender Gomrawi (Awood)


	
	Zackaria Gomrawi (also known as Sam Awood) was sentenced for an offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity (64.9 grams) of nexus. This corresponded with the applicant's commercial supply offence (nothing turns on the fact that his offence was one of ""knowingly taking part""). His Honour Judge Hanley SC imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. His Honour's sentencing judgment was before Bennett DCJ. It is to be recalled that the indicative sentence for the applicant was one of 5 years.
	
	
	Hanley DCJ was satisfied that Gomrawi was ""a middleman or facilitator for the ultimate supply to the UCO"" and that he ""held a more important position [than] the co-offender El Ahmad in that it is clear he could negotiate price and quantity of the drug to be supplied"". But he also found that Gomrawi did not exercise control over the drugs that had to come from someone else. In addition, his Honour took into account that Gomrawi was not going to receive any financial benefit himself; his motivation was to raise money to pay for legal expenses for the applicant's partner, his friend, who was facing drug charges.
	
	
	Gomrawi was not found to be motivated by his own drug use. He was 36 years old. He had experienced a ""reasonably unsettled and at times tragic life"". He had been married and had a daughter as well as a son who died shortly after birth. He was diagnosed with depression in the aftermath of that event. He was on antidepressant medication in custody having been diagnosed with a ""major depressive episode"".
	
	
	Gomrawi was described as having a lengthy criminal record which included a prior conviction for drug supply. There was the aggravating feature that the offence was committed whilst on bail (his record suggests this was for another drug supply offence). A plea of guilty had been entered in the District Court and the judge allowed a 15 per cent discount. Remorse was not found; nor was an unlikelihood of further offending or good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Bennett DCJ referred in summary form to these matters but did not give any indication of how he thought the applicant's case compared with that of Gomrawi. In the proceedings on sentence he indicated that if the Crown’s concession that Gomrawi’s criminality was at a greater level than the applicant was accepted, the applicant should receive “a slightly lesser sentence to ensure parity”.
	
	
	In this Court, counsel for the applicant identified some comparative features of the two cases that, he submitted, pointed to his client receiving a more favourable sentencing outcome than Gomrawi. I conclude that ""a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened would see that the [applicant's] grievance is justified"": R v Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114 at [34] (Johnson J).
	
	
	This ground should be upheld.
	


Ground 5 - The sentencing judge erred in assessing the co-offender Chew's sentence as relevant to the applicant in terms of parity


	
	Alan Chew was sentenced by Madgwick ADCJ on 11 March 2014 for supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (sentenced to 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years) and three offences of supplying a prohibited drug (concurrent fixed terms of 1 year). He was a man in his mid-20s with no prior criminal convictions (aside from two minor driving offences).
	
	
	Two of the offences of supplying a (non-commercial quantity of a) prohibited drug related to two of the transactions in the applicant's ongoing supply offence.
	
	
	Bennett DCJ referred, again in summary form, to the sentencing of Chew and, as with Gomrawi, did not give any indication of how he considered it to be relevant. The applicant's counsel placed some store in the fact that his Honour's reference included the commercial supply offence which had no bearing upon the applicant's offences. It was submitted that this ""must have placed upward pressure"" on the sentence imposed upon the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant's submissions cannot be accepted given the judge gave no indication that he took the sentencing of Chew into account in any fashion. In fact, why he referred to it in some detail when it was only of passing interest and had nothing to do with parity is hard to understand.
	
	
	This ground should be rejected.
	


Ground 6 - The sentence was manifestly excessive


	
	It is unnecessary to deal with this ground. The submissions made in support of it make reference to matters that should be taken into account in exercising the s 6(3) sentencing discretion.
	


Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act


	
	Having found error, it is necessary to consider whether in the exercise of this Court's own sentencing discretion, some other sentence whether more or less severe was warranted and should have been passed: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37. This includes consideration of events since sentencing as set out in affidavits affirmed by the applicant and her solicitor.
	
	
	The applicant's affidavit describes her experience in custody. She has experienced difficulties with her Crohn's disease as Bennett DCJ anticipated. These difficulties were greater in a higher security environment, but now the applicant is housed in an “Independent Living Unit” outside the main gaol. She lives with eight other women and has her own bedroom. She describes the concerns she has about her three daughters who are now aged 13, 17 and 19. The youngest is in refuge and the Department of Community Services has forbidden the applicant calling her. The applicant has occupied her time working and completing courses, including a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. She has hopes of living with a sister when she is released; obtaining employment; and establishing a stable environment so she can have her youngest daughter live with her.
	
	
	The affidavit affirmed by the applicant's solicitor annexes a variety of documents and certificates which serve to confirm what the applicant says about her participation in employment and courses.
	
	
	Submissions by the applicant's counsel placed some emphasis upon the quantities of drug involved in each of the offences but in my assessment the quantities are unremarkable. I accept that the commercial supply offence involved a quantity that was ""well short of the large commercial quantity"" but it was also well in excess of the minimum to qualify as a commercial quantity. The quantity involved in the ongoing supply offence was about 16 grams but relatively small quantities are often encountered in relation to this offence. The objective gravity of an offence of ongoing supply in s 25A is not measured by the quantity of drug alone; ""the section is directed [at] those who are indulging in a practice or business of supplying prohibited drugs"": R v Giang [2005] NSWCCA 387 at [18]. (Hulme J).
	
	
	The applicant's role was subsidiary to Gomrawi in relation to the commercial supply offence and Chew in relation to the ongoing supply offence but Bennett DCJ was correct to characterise her as a ""significant participant"" nonetheless.
	
	
	The starting point adopted by Bennett DCJ for the commercial supply offence before allowance for the plea of guilty must have been 6 years 8 months. The starting point for Gomrawi's sentence for that offence must have been 4 years 8 months. There is no justification for the applicant's sentence to have been assessed at such a significantly higher level.
	
	
	The written submissions for the applicant cited three ""comparable cases"" involving the supply of nexus. It is questionable whether a case needs to concern the precise same drug in order to be ""comparable"". In any event, the more significant guideposts, in my view, are the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Sentencing statistics were relied upon in support of the applicant's contention that the ongoing supply offence was manifestly excessive. The current iteration indicates that the 3 year indicative sentence was the median for the 78 per cent of offenders who received a sentence of full-time imprisonment (all of whom had pleaded guilty).
	
	
	The applicant has a number of features of her subjective case that demanded some amelioration of her sentence. Counsel pointed to her “really parlous start to life”, undergoing an arranged marriage at the age of 13 to a close relative who was physically and verbally abusive and introduced her to drugs. Although her drug addiction cannot be regarded in any way as an excuse for her crimes the fact that it had its origins in such circumstances in her teenage years is of some significance: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [273](c) (Wood CJ at CL). True it is that she eschewed the opportunity for rehabilitation under the Drug Court program and that it is an aggravating feature that her offences were committed whilst she was on that and other forms of conditional liberty. But it my view the overall subjective case for the applicant is one that justifies a measure of leniency that could not ordinarily be extended in a case involving flagrant and serious involvement in drug supply.
	
	
	In my view, appropriate starting points are 4 years for the commercial supply offence and 3 years for the ongoing supply offence.
	
	
	An allowance must be made for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. Given the pleas were entered on the day the applicant's trial was due to commence, albeit with notice having been given to the Crown a month before, a discount of no more than 15 per cent can be allowed. That would yield indicative sentences (with rounding) of 3 years 4 months and 2 years 6 months respectively.
	
	
	The commencement date of the sentence must be assessed with the principle of totality in mind. As previously observed, the applicant was subject to an existing sentence of 3 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 2 years dating from 9 October 2011. The non-parole period expired on 8 October 2013. In my respectful view, the degree to which Bennett DCJ partially accumulated the sentence upon the existing sentence was inadequate. It had the effect of substantially obliterating punishment for a significant number and variety of offences committed by the applicant over a period of more than two years. Significant, but not complete, accumulation upon the non-parole period of the existing sentence is appropriate.
	
	
	Accumulation of the indicative sentences so as to arrive at an aggregate sentence is also guided by the principle of totality. Bennett DCJ adopted a notional level of accumulation of 6 months. In my view, given the separate criminality in each offence, the accumulation should be somewhat greater. The Court should impose an aggregate sentence of 4 years.
	
	
	A non-parole period which gives effect to the finding of special circumstances (which should also take into account the partial accumulation upon the existing sentence should be maintained) should be 2 years 2 months.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


(1) Leave to appeal against sentence granted and appeal allowed.

(2) Sentence imposed in the District Court on 2 May 2014 quashed.

(3) Sentence the applicant to an aggregate term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years 2 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 10 months. The sentence is to date from 9 April 2013. The non-parole period will expire on 8 June 2015 and the total term will expire on 8 April 2017.


	
	ADAMSON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2424744,R v SB; R v AE; R v MG [2015] NSWSC 659,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Each of the three offenders, SB, AE and MG, to whom I shall refer in these remarks as “the offenders”, was charged on indictment that on 5 November 2010 he did murder Eden Delir. Each offender entered a not guilty plea to the charge.
	
	
	The names of the offenders and of certain witnesses have been suppressed from publication under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. That order, however, does not restrict publication of these remarks.
	
	
	The offenders were tried jointly. Guilty verdicts on the charge of murder in each case were returned against each of the offenders on the following dates:
	


SB: 21 November 2014

AE: 21 November 2014

MG: 26 November 2014


	
	In sentencing each of the offenders it is necessary to proceed upon the basis that the offence for which each of the offenders has been convicted is the most serious in the criminal calendar. The start point is recognition of the fact that a human life has been taken. In this case, the victim Eden Delir, a 17 year old young man on the threshold of adult life, lost his life in consequence of the carrying out of the joint criminal enterprise with which this case is concerned. The community expects that the sanctity of human life will be protected by the law and that those who take it will be appropriately punished.
	
	
	I am required to bear in mind the relevant statutory framework that pertains to the sentencing of offenders and to the principles which have been enunciated in the case law authorities that bear upon the issue. I must have regard, amongst other matters, to the purposes of sentencing which are set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Act”).
	
	
	Section 3A provides:
	


The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:

(a)   to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b)   to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c)   to protect the community from the offender,

(d)   to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e)   to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f)   to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g)   to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.


	
	I must also, in determining the appropriate sentence, have regard to the various aggravating factors which are set out in s 21A of the Sentencing Act. Suffice it to say that I have had regard to the statutory requirements to which I have referred and given what I have considered to be due weight to the matters I consider as being of particular relevance.
	
	
	I must also weigh in the balance those matters upon which the offenders are entitled to rely upon in order to mitigate the otherwise appropriate penalty: s 21A(3) of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	The Crown put its case to the jury at trial upon the basis of direct responsibility murder, that is, that each of the offenders was a party to a joint criminal enterprise which had as its object the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon the deceased.
	
	
	The Crown alternatively relied upon extended joint criminal enterprise murder. A joint criminal enterprise of that kind had as its object the assault of the deceased, but in carrying out the joint enterprise, there was a substantial risk within contemplation of the offenders that one or more of the participants to it might commit the offence of causing grievous bodily harm to Eden Delir, with intent to do so.
	
	
	The Crown case was that at the time of the offence each offender was present and actively participated in the execution of the joint criminal enterprise agreement or at least participated by being ready and willing to provide assistance or encouragement to another or other participants in it in the commission of the crime.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the jury’s verdicts, for the purpose of sentence, should be determined as having been reached upon the basis of the existence of a joint criminal enterprise, the object of which was to inflict grievous bodily harm: T 6 March 2015 at p 4:10-15; Crown’s Written Submissions, 6 March 2015 at [1].
	
	
	Counsel for each of the offenders, however, submitted that the jury’s verdicts should be determined upon the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise murder of the kind to which I have referred.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is life imprisonment: Crimes Act 1900: s 19A. The provisions of Division 1A – Standard Non-Parole Periods - of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 do not apply to the sentencing of the offenders as each was under the age of 18 years at the time the offence in each case was committed: s 54D(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Further, in these proceedings there are no grounds to apply the provisions of s 61(1) of that Act, which deal with the imposition of life sentences. There was no submission to the contrary made by the Crown.
	
	
	It is my duty to determine the facts relevant to sentencing the offenders which are to be founded on the evidence adduced at their trial. My view of the facts must be consistent with the verdicts of the jury and findings of fact I make against the offenders must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. Matters of mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202 at 204.
	


Factual Matters


	
	I turn to the circumstances relevant to the offending conduct. I propose to include transcript references in the written version of these remarks without detailing them during this delivery of them.
	
	
	On 30 October 2010 the teenage daughter of the occupants of a house in Restwell Road, Ms BT, held a costume-dress Halloween party. A large number of people attended.
	
	
	The offenders – SB, MG and AE - were part of a group of young males who were described in evidence as of Middle Eastern appearance. Included in this group were the co-offenders JP and JH. JP was convicted of an offence of manslaughter in respect of the death of Eden Delir by a jury on 4 November 2013 following a separate trial. He was sentenced by me on 30 May 2014 to 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years. The other co-offender JH was also convicted of an offence of manslaughter in respect of the death of Eden Delir by a jury on 13 October 2014. He was sentenced on 12 December 2014 to 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years. The group of young males also included AN, a co-offender who was also charged with murder in respect of Eden Delir’s death. The Crown accepted AN’s guilty plea to the offence of manslaughter and he was sentenced in respect of that offence on 19 December 2014.
	
	
	The group of young males attended the party uninvited. A number of them arrived together having travelled there in a red Toyota Camry station wagon owned by a member of MG’s family. The car, in which objects associated with the deceased were located, was in due course the subject of police investigations. The offender AE arrived unaccompanied, having been driven to the party by his mother. He then joined the other young males who had arrived together. Some at least of the group were known and referred to in the course of these proceedings as the “Wakeley boys”.
	
	
	One party-goer, Ms JD, saw the car pull up and saw five young males emerge from it. She recognised the co-offenders JP and JH as members of the “Wakeley boys”. As they walked up the driveway she heard JH say: “Let’s go have some fun boys”: T 557.
	
	
	Their purpose in attending the party was to confront another group of young males who they believed would be attending the party. The members of the other group were referred to as the “Campbelltown boys”.
	
	
	After their arrival at the party premises the young males exhibited aggressive behaviour, challenging individual partygoers, asking in loud voices “Are you a Campbelltown boy?”, or calling out “Are the Campbelltown boys here?”. One partygoer, GE, gave evidence that when he was confronted in this way the person asking him that question had a knife which he pointed at him (T 485). Later that evening, police found a knife on a grassed area outside the front of the house where the party took place. The same witness said he saw a member of the group holding a pole. He though that person was JP. Ms JD gave similar evidence (T 555), as did witness A-D (T 608), and JE (T 688). The witness ED also saw one of the group holding a pole (T 750), as did witness KC (T 973-4, 1037).
	
	
	The Crown referred to this aggressive display at this early stage of the party as evidence that the members of the group of young males in question possessed an aggressive frame of mind and had come prepared for a physical confrontation. As events transpired, there were no Campbelltown boys in attendance at the party. However, the members of the group remained in attendance at the party, although uninvited. The Crown case was that the violent assaults on Eden Delir a little later in the evening, are to be seen against this background. The Crown submitted that the aggressive males had arrived at the party, in effect, primed or ready for a physical and, if necessary, a violent confrontation.
	
	
	Ms BT, whose party it was, gave evidence that after it started she walked to the front of her house and spoke to the group of young males and asked them not to start a fight because she did not want trouble at her party. She estimated that the “boys” constituting the group were about 15-16 years of age. She told them the Campbelltown boys were not attending her party.
	
	
	Evidence was given that those who were acting in an aggressive manner had objects in hand and that some of these objects were used to bang on the front door: PP (T 250-251). The group soon moved from the front of the house to the back where they continued to call out aggressively.
	
	
	There was evidence that one of the group, the co-offender JP, was seen with what was referred to in evidence as a trolley handle (witness AM at T 608). The witness LM said one of the group was holding what looked like a metal pole, perhaps a barbell (T 228, 246). The witness PP said he saw what he referred to as “weapons” that he said were “like car locks …” (T 251).
	
	
	Miss MH said she recognised JH and told him not to disrespect the house. He told her to “shut the fuck up” (T 821).
	
	
	Another witness, AH, said he looked out the window and saw Ms BT speaking to the uninvited group of young males. He said they seemed to be aggressive and he saw one of them had a cylindrical metal pole in his left pocket. He said he later saw members of this group in the backyard and subsequently saw them walk to the front yard. At this lastmentioned time, after they had moved to the front of the house, the witness said he saw one of the group pick up a bottle and take it out to the front of the house (T 271, 276, 280). He identified that person as the co-offender JP. The rest of the young males in the uninvited group were out the front of the house when he saw JP do this (T 282). He said JP was attempting to conceal the bottle (T 279). The bottle, he said, was empty or mainly empty (T 286, T 290). The witness AH said he saw a member of the group at that stage with a pole which was sticking out of his pocket (T 279).
	


The Assault Upon Eden Delir


	
	The ensuing attack upon Eden Delir may be divided into three stages. The first was the prelude to the attack. The second was evidence as to the attack itself. The third concerns the events that followed the smashing of a bottle on the victim’s head which included the intervention of KC and the chase of Eden Delir up Restwell Road.
	
	
	At the time of the attack it was reasonably dark but there was some light from the front of the house and from a street light. A number of witnesses gave evidence of seeing the group of young males of Middle Eastern appearance standing on the nature strip in front of the house. This was the same group of young males who had been behaving aggressively earlier in the evening. They were talking amongst themselves. Some witnesses said that it sounded like they were arguing. One of them called out to Eden Delir. Two witnesses gave evidence of hearing one of the group of males call out to Eden “come over here you fat cunt” (witness BJ at T 382 and witness LM at T 231-2). Another heard the words as “hey fatty … yeah you… come down here” (witness JE). Another witness, JZ, heard one of the young males call out “hey Eden” (T 839). One witness, ED, said he heard one of the males say “Oh, that’s the guy that snitched” (T 751). He also heard another say “hit him” or “we’re going to hit him” (T 767). The witness, ED, said he walked over to Eden and told him not to go down to the footpath (T 751, 761). However, Eden walked towards the group and said “what’s wrong?” (T 770).
	
	
	One of the young males distracted Eden by saying “what does it say on your hat?” and pointing to it. The witness JD said one of the young males in the group grabbed Eden’s cap and said “what’s this”.
	
	
	The evidence was that another of the young males then ran around a parked truck and delivered a powerful punch to the right side of Eden’s head with such force as to cause him to fall to the ground. Witness JE also gave similar evidence. There was no evidence from which the identity of the assailant could be established (T 638).
	
	
	The witness KC said he saw a group of six young males out the front of the house just before the attack. They were the same group that he had spoken to inside the house and had seen at the back of the house (T 978).
	
	
	The witness LM said that after Eden had been knocked to the ground he saw him at one point on one knee. By this time the group of young males had surrounded Eden Delir in a circle formation (T 232, 234-5). He said there were six to seven in the circle (T 233). The witness said he saw, at one point, a male hit Eden over the head with a “V” bottle and it shattered. The male holding the bottle was holding it in his right hand (T 234). The witness LM then said other members of the group proceeded to attack Eden for five to ten seconds (T 232, 235, 249). He said all members of the group were engaged in this activity (T 239). He said there were about seven “boys” “throwing punches and kicks” (T 244). He said this came after the bottle attack (T 235). He did not see a pole being used in the assaults (T 235). The witness said he was standing one to two metres away when this happened (T 232). LM said that after the attacks the majority of the attackers fled to a red car, but that one of the group proceeded to pursue Eden and “kept attacking him for a short amount of time” (T 236). He said the male he saw who pursued or chased Eden was not “armed” (T 237). He described that person as “stocky”, “large” (T 237). He had black hair and was part of the group he had seen earlier (T 249).
	
	
	A number of other witnesses gave evidence of hearing the bottle smash followed by the sound of a scream (T 313). Similar evidence was given by witness GE (T 490). The witness TM also gave evidence of seeing a group of males standing in a circular formation around Eden Delir and they were “kicking and stomping” him (T 340). This, he said, went on for anywhere from five to ten seconds (T 343,373).
	
	
	Another witness, BJ, saw one of the males in the attacking group holding a pole but he did not see the pole used in any way. This was at a point before Eden Delir went down to the ground (T 386). He confirmed that after the victim fell to the ground members of the group “just started laying into him after that” that is “kicking and punching” (T 384, T 395). Similar evidence was given by other witnesses, including the witness CO at T 435 and witness JE at T 643. JE said that during the barrage of hits, kicks and punches” Eden Delir was in the foetal position with his hands over his head (T 644). She said she heard Eden Delir call out “stop, stop, leave me alone” (T 437-8). She also recalled seeing one of the group holding a pole (T 440) as did witness LD-M at T 461. He said he saw a pole being held during the attack. He said he saw it “being lifted” after he heard the bottle smash but did not see it actually make contact with Eden Delir (T 464).
	
	
	The witness ED said he saw a member of the group with a pole and that person used it to hit Eden Delir across his head once (T 755, T 799). His recollection was that this occurred before the bottle was used. He saw the punch that knocked Eden Delir to the ground (T 756). He heard Eden screaming. The witness JD said that after that first punch he head Eden yell out “what the fuck”. JD said all of the group then “ambushed him and they were all hitting him” and “kicking and stomping” (T 842). He a little later said that the kicking and stomping was done by two “chubby guys” (T 877). There were more involved in the attack – at least four (T 843). He said that they had surrounded the victim.
	
	
	The witness KC was one of the invited guests at the party. He was in my opinion a very impressive witness. He was a tall young man who had come to the party dressed in a gladiator’s outfit. As will be discussed, he exposed himself to the risk of being caught up in the attack upon Eden Delir when he intervened in an endeavour to stop further assaults upon the victim who by then was in an extremely vulnerable and injured condition.
	
	
	KC’s evidence, importantly, established a number of facts. These included:
	



	
	The use of a pole. He said the first thing he saw in the early part of the attack was the shining of a pole as it was being swung – reflecting off a streetlight or lights from another source (T 980-1) He said it was being swung like a baseball bat (T 980).
	
	
	He heard a bottle smash but did not actually see it hit Eden Delir (T 987).
	
	
	He said he saw the group of young males punching and kicking Eden Delir during two altercations. The first was after the bottle was smashed. He then saw Eden break away from the group. He saw two males peel off from the group. He heard Eden Delir scream something and saw him fall down. Four or five of the young males eventually caught up to him and started punching and kicking him wherever they could (T 982). The second, or next altercation, occurred at the bottom of the driveway about 5-10 metres from the first (T 982). Two more males peeled off from the group. He saw Eden stand up and start running but two other males from the group pursued him – one wearing a blue shirt was pushing Eden and the other had a pole (T 981-3). He believed the latter person was the one who he had seen swing a pole at Eden Delir before the bottle incident (T 1040). He described seeing that male trying to line Eden up to hit him again, by using the pole “like a batter swings a baseball bat” (T 984). The male in the blue shirt was trying to push Eden from behind.
	
	
	He said Eden Delir was being kicked and punched and that it appeared to him that they were trying to hit him as hard as they could (T 997). He said he saw blows delivered to the victim’s head, mostly kicking – he saw Eden was holding has hands over his head.
	



	
	On my assessment of the evidence, it establishes to the requisite standard, and I so find, that the male who was chasing Eden Delir together with a second male and who was carrying a pole, was the same person that a number of witnesses identified as the one who had earlier swung a pole at Eden Delir striking him on the head with it. The evidence of those witnesses identified SB as that person: (T 984, 1041, 1046); (Witness TD: T 339, 343, 351-2, 353, 371, 373, Exhibit Z; Witness CO: T 440, 441-2, 452-3; Witness LD-M: T 461-2, 464, 481, 478; Witness ED: T 755, 770, 777, 799, Exhibits BW, BX; Witness KC: T 984, 981-3, 997, 1028, 1040-1, Exhibit CY.)
	
	
	The Crown additionally relied upon what it contended constituted admissions by SB in an intercepted telephone call on 4 November 2010 in which he stated “no, nothing we just hit him”.
	
	
	Whilst accordingly there was evidence which in my assessment established that SB earlier in the attack struck the deceased with a pole, and later was chasing him with a pole, I accept, as Mr Stratton submitted, that Dr Wills indicated that there was no evidence that any striking by use of the pole was sufficient to have occasioned visible signs of injury.
	
	
	Apart from SB, the evidence of the above witnesses, in particular that of KC, identified the other male who was chasing and pushing Eden Delir as the offender AE.
	
	
	Whilst the above evidence as to the chase involving SB and AE was relied upon by the Crown as one factor that supported a finding that they intended grievous bodily harm for reasons given in these remarks, I do not accept that the evidence supports that proposition. The evidence does, however, reflect the active involvement of SB and AE in the attack upon Eden Delir and supports the conclusion to the requisite standard that they considered, up to the point of the chase by them, that in their minds Eden Delir was deserving of physical punishment for his supposed “snitching” concerning JH’s role a separate attack on Eden Delir which had occurred in February 2010.
	
	
	The attack upon Eden Delir plainly involved planning and coordination made in the short period between Eden Delir being seen at the party and the attack upon him. The coordination involved one member of the group calling Eden Delir over to where the group members were standing, then distracting him. That was almost immediately followed by another member delivering a forceful blow to the right side of his head causing him to fall to the ground, followed by a series of further attacks.
	
	
	It is clear on the evidence, “snitching” – the reporting to police of criminal activity by another or others – was considered in the relevant group culture, of which the three offenders and three co-offenders were part, as a treacherous thing to do. “Snitching” – providing information to police – was in effect considered by the offenders and others in their group to be a breach of what was seen as a code of silence that existed to protect those who engaged in criminal activity. The evidence established that such a perverted sense of group solidarity was one that was strongly held or entrenched amongst the offenders and the other participants in the joint criminal enterprise and seen as justifying violent retaliation. It was the matter that was central to the motivation for the attack upon Eden Delir.
	


Medical Evidence


	
	The medical evidence tendered during the trial established that the overall pattern, position and nature of the injuries suffered by the deceased revealed upon the post-mortem examination of the deceased performed on 9 November 2010 by Dr Stephen Wills, Forensic Pathologist, that there had been assaults upon the deceased involving several points of blunt impact to the head, the face and an additional sharp force injury together with other injuries as specified in the evidence. In that respect, multiple bruises on the deceased’s right arm, and bruising to areas of the lower limbs, it was accepted by Dr Wills could be caused by kicks or direct blows.
	
	
	A CT scan showed an acute left-sided subdural haematoma. This, it was explained by Dr Wills, caused pressure within the skull to rise with secondary effects upon the brain, in particular, starving it of blood and oxygen. The increase in pressure compromised blood flow into the skull and caused damage to the brain due to starvation of blood. In the joint trial involving the offenders it was accepted that head injuries giving rise to the subdural haematoma resulted from injuries caused by the co-offender JP smashing a bottle on the head of the deceased.
	


The Verdicts


	
	The Crown case against the offenders, as I have earlier indicated, was brought upon the principles of joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	As earlier mentioned, the Crown submitted that the agreement to which the offenders were parties involved a joint criminal enterprise to do grievous bodily harm to Eden Delir: Crown Submissions, T 6 March 2015 at p 4:10-15; Crown’s Written Submissions on Sentence at [1].
	
	
	In the Crown’s oral submissions, the Crown pointed to factors such as the evidence of pre-planning, and the coordinated manner of the attacks upon Eden Delir, to support the proposition that the offenders were parties to an agreement to apply what was referred to as “the full force of violence”. The Crown also pointed to particular matters relating to the offenders SB; AE and MG at T 5-6. The Crown submitted that the matters it relied upon to support these submissions arose, in part, as a matter of inference: T 6:20-25.
	
	
	On grounds which I will shortly identify, I have concluded that the jury’s verdicts of murder against each of the offenders was returned upon the basis that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each offender was a party to an agreement to assault the deceased and that in the course of carrying out the agreement the parties to it assaulted Eden Delir, including in particular the assault by the co-offender JP by smashing the bottle over Eden Delir’s head. I am also satisfied that the jury found that, although the infliction of grievous bodily harm was not within the agreement, the offenders contemplated that in the course of carrying out the agreement to assault the deceased, one or more parties to the agreement might deliberately apply physical force to the body of the deceased with an intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	It has been necessary in determining the basis for the jury’s verdicts to examine the matters established by the evidence adduced at the combined trial. That evidence established beyond reasonable doubt the following:
	



	
	That Eden Delir was lured over to the group and then deliberately distracted by one member whilst another delivered the forceful blow to the right side of his head, causing him to fall to the ground.
	
	
	That members of the attacking group then adopted a circle formation around Eden Delir which obstructed him escaping.
	
	
	Following a flurry of attacks by all of the group members, the co-offender JP, one of the attacking group, smashed an empty or at least part empty bottle of wine over Eden Delir’s head.
	
	
	Members of the attacking group continued to punch, kick and stomp on Eden Delir after he was wounded by the assault with the bottle.
	
	
	Throughout the attacks on Eden Delir, members of the group, by their presence and actions, provided encouragement and support to each other.
	
	
	Following this series of events, Eden Delir broke away from the group that was attacking him, fell down and members of the group of young males caught up to him and kicked and punched him.
	
	
	Eden Delir got up again and ran when two males pursued him, one in a blue shirt pushing him and the other holding a pole. The person with the pole was lining up to strike Eden Delir with the pole but was prevented from doing so when one of the partygoers, KC, intervened and prevented him from doing so.
	



	
	Evidence in relation to the above series of events was given by a number of witnesses including KC.
	
	
	The Crown case accepted that it was the act of the co-offender JP in striking the deceased with the bottle that inflicted the injury that resulted in the acute left-sided subdural haematoma. The deceased was on life support until the life support system was discontinued on 5 November 2010.
	
	
	I return to the issue of the basis of the jury’s verdicts. The evidence established to the requisite standard that each of the offenders was present during the series of events to which I have referred in points (1) to (7). The evidence also established to that standard that each of the offenders was part of the attacking group in the circular formation to which I have referred and that each participated in assaulting Eden Delir. That participation involved, subject to comments I will shortly make, kicking, punching and stomping upon the deceased as earlier described. By their presence and participation, each of the offenders provided encouragement and support to members of the attacking group.
	
	
	In relation to the series of assaults which the offenders participated in, the evidence did not detail the precise number or nature of the individual assaults specifically by the offenders by other participants. That is, of course, explained by factors such as the speed at which events moved, the lighting conditions, the shock engendered by the events and the number of persons carrying out the various assaults. Additionally, the medical evidence did not link any one or more of the many injuries detected at the postmortem examination as attributable to any particular or specific assault by one or other of the three offenders who now stand for sentence.
	
	
	In summary the jury’s verdicts of murder in relation to each of SB, AE and MG were returned as and upon the basis of the following matters which were by the evidence, established beyond reasonable doubt:
	



	
	That SB, AE and MG were parties to an agreement to assault the deceased and that in the course of carrying out the agreement the co-offender JP deliberately struck the deceased on the head with the bottle with an intention to cause grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	That each of the three offenders contemplated that in the course of carrying out the agreement to assault the deceased, a party or parties to the agreement might deliberately apply physical force to the body of the deceased (as the co-offender JP did), with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm whilst participating in the execution of the agreement.
	



	
	Accordingly, for the reasons I have stated, each of the offenders is to be sentenced on the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise murder.
	


Subjective Factors


	
	I turn to consider the evidence that addressed the subjective factors of each of the offenders. First, the offender SB.
	


SB


	
	The offender SB is presently aged 20 years and was aged 16 years at the date of the subject offence. He was interviewed on four occasions for the purpose of a Juvenile Justice Background Report dated 20 February 2015. He was granted bail on 17 September 2013 and remained on bail until his date of conviction on 21 Novembers 2014.
	
	
	SB’s family has demonstrated support for him. He has engaged positively in programs in custody, including school, drug and alcohol counselling and sporting activities. There have been four Minor Misbehavior Reports. He has sought and obtained counselling services and has engaged positively with the same. He has generally been cooperative and has interacted positively with staff and other detainees. Reference was made in the Background Report to his lack of acceptance of responsibility towards his offence.
	
	
	I note that SB was prepared to disclose to the Juvenile Justice officers who prepared the Background Report facts concerning his involvement in the offence. Though minimising his involvement he accepted that his actions were reckless and dangerous with minimal regard for the victim and the possible consequences. I consider his preparedness to acknowledge his involvement in the subject offence supports a positive prospect for his rehabilitation. This is especially so given that the Background Report indicates an absence of entrenched patterns of impulsive, risk taking or challenging behavior. Overall, I consider that SB has very favourable rehabilitation prospects.
	
	
	The Background Report also refers to SB’s expression of sorrow as to the death of Eden Delir upon Eden’s family; an expression of sorrow I consider to be entirely genuine. Indeed, Dr Furst, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, noted in his report that he expressed remorse about his actions stating “I regret it one hundred per cent. Now I know what’s right and wrong”.
	
	
	The offender’s engagement in programs and with services that have been available to him in custody, including his Year 11 studies and the fact that he is endeavouring to get on with his life in a productive manner are additional matters, along with the support he has from his family, that all enhance his prospects of rehabilitation as I have previously stated.
	
	
	Dr Furst noted in his report dated 2 March 2015 (p 4) that SB had used his time in juvenile detention constructively completing a number of courses and seeking counselling.
	
	
	Dr Furst also stated that he would benefit from continued counselling in Juvenile Detention. He considered that he has good prospects of being successfully rehabilitated and generally had a low risk of re-offending. I accept that the risk of him reoffending is low.
	
	
	The specific matters raised in the submissions of Senior Counsel on behalf of SB, include:
	



	
	That he offered to plead guilty to manslaughter and did not dispute his presence at the party at the time of the attack.
	
	
	His expression of contrition.
	
	
	The principles that apply to the sentencing of juvenile offenders.
	
	
	The fact that he has no prior criminal record.
	
	
	His good prospects of rehabilitation and low risk of re-offending.
	
	
	The restrictions on him from the bail conditions imposed.
	
	
	Credit to be given for the significant period he has spent in custody.
	
	
	The facts and circumstances that support a finding of special circumstances for the purpose of s 44 of the Sentencing Act.
	


Special Circumstances


	
	SB has a strong subjective case to support a finding of special circumstances in terms of s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act. These included:
	



	
	His age (15 years at the date of the offence; presently 20 years of age).
	
	
	His expression of contrition.
	
	
	His good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	His acknowledgment, to a point, of his personal involvement and responsibility in the offence.
	
	
	His full use of programs that have been made available to him in custody.
	



	
	These factors in their totality justify a finding of special circumstances. I have had regard to them in determining the appropriate variation to be made to the statutory ratio.
	


AE


	
	The offender AE was aged 16 years and 4 months as at the date of the offence.
	
	
	He was interviewed by Juvenile Justice officers for the purpose of assessment which led to the production of a Background Report dated 25 February 2015. The report notes that AE has, concerning his period in custody in a Juvenile Justice Centre, been of good behavior, easily managed and is liked by his peers and staff. There were no breaches whilst he was on bail. He has had positive family relationships and continues to have strong family support.
	
	
	Before the subject offence he previously had entered into an apprenticeship and undertaken a TAFE course. In custody he has completed some theory components in automotive mechanics. He is reported as having a good work ethic.
	
	
	The Background Report provides observations as to AE’s attitudes and beliefs about violence in general and some justifications, as AE sees it, for the use of violence.
	
	
	The report observed that such attitudes are considered risk factors to violence recidivism. The report observed that they are capable of being targeted with cognitive behavioural therapy.
	
	
	Any assessment of AE’s risk of future offending, of course, must bring into account his attitude to his serious offending. In the Background Report (p 4) the authors, Mr Warton, Juvenile Justice Counsellor and Ms Greeks, Area Manager, record AE’s statement to the effect that he believed that he must support his friends if he perceives they have been wronged or are in trouble. In terms of his future risk of reoffending, much will, of course, depend upon whether AE receives and responds appropriately to therapy or counselling referred to in the Background Report.
	
	
	Affidavit evidence of AE’s sister dated 6 March 2015 was read at the hearing. In paras [12]‑[16] his sister provided evidence as to the restrictive nature of her brother’s bail conditions. A copy of AE’s bail conditions imposed on 17 July 2014 was tendered in evidence.
	


Special Circumstances


	
	In determining the question of special circumstances of AE, the following matters are to be taken into account:
	



	
	The fact that there has been “significant personality maturation” since the commission of his offence: Background Report at p 4.
	
	
	His youth (age 16 years 4 months at the date of the offence).
	
	
	His behaviour and progress in custody.
	
	
	The benefits from being able to pursue work in the community to his rehabilitation (possibly in the automotive mechanics trade).
	
	
	His lack of criminal antecedents.
	


MG


	
	The offender MG is presently aged 20 years. He was 15 years and 10 months of age at the date of the offence. The fact that he was a juvenile at that time, as I have indicated, is a relevant matter to be taken into account in relation to a number of considerations involved in sentencing. These include the fact that less weight should be given to general deterrence and retribution. It was submitted by Mr Steel of counsel on his behalf that his cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity is likely to have played a significant role in his offending behaviour. I accept that submission. The Background Report by Juvenile Justice was unable to assess these matters as the offender was reluctant to discuss the circumstances of his offending when interviewed. I accept in general terms that he offender’s immaturity did play a role in the subject offence.
	
	
	At the time of his offence he did not have criminal record. After the offence he was dealt with by the Parramatta Children’s Court for a number of offences committed after the subject offence in late 2010. Good behaviour bonds were imposed on him in respect of three counts of Break and Enter a Dwelling House and Steal and a bond in respect of an offence of Damage Property by Fire.
	
	
	Following his arrest on 19 October 2011 he complied with all his bail conditions, bail having been granted on 20 October 2011. His bail was revoked following his conviction on 26 November 2014.
	
	
	He has not committed any offences since being on bail other than those to which I have referred.
	
	
	He was interviewed by officers of Juvenile Justice on five occasions for assessment on the basis of which a detailed Background Report by Juvenile Justice dated 23 February 2015 was prepared and tendered at the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	The report comments upon MG’s largely positive behaviour and program participation whilst in custody and the strong and consistent family support that he has received.
	
	
	Reference was made in the report to the offender’s low literacy level and problems encountered during his schooling and the effects of the marital breakdown of his parents’ relationship.
	
	
	The Background Report indicates that the offender has struggled to accept responsibility for his offending behavior and minimised his responsibility (p 8).
	
	
	In a further Juvenile Justice Report dated 19 March 2015, it is observed that MG has a need for an intensive literacy program and has progressed under an earlier Literacy Program.
	
	
	MG was assessed by Dr Olav Nielssen, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, on one occasion who provided a report dated 26 February 2015. I have noted the history and observations made by Dr Nielssen including the possibility, on the symptoms related to him by MG, of the possible future development of a psychotic illness that may require observation and anti-psychotic medication if it does develop.
	
	
	In a further report dated 11 March 2015, Dr Nielssen provided his opinion in support of MG’s detention in the Juvenile Justice System for a further year.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen identified the factors that favour MG’s rehabilitation, in particular, his young age, growth in maturity and greater self-awareness and prospects for future employment. I find that MG has reasonable rehabilitation prospects.
	
	
	Submissions were made by Mr Steel on MG’s strict bail conditions, a copy of which were tendered on sentence. It was contended that the conditions imposed were akin to home detention but with even further restriction prohibiting internet access, or access or possession of a mobile phone.
	
	
	The submission was that the bail conditions may be taken into account at sentence.
	
	
	Mr Steel submitted that a finding of special circumstances should be made based on MG’s youth, the fact that this is the first time he has spent in custody and that he will require counseling on release to parole. I propose to make a finding of special circumstances having regard to these matters.
	
	
	As to the circumstances of the offending, it was submitted that there was no evidence of any specific role performed by MG and that his offence was at the lower end of the range of objective gravity. His criminal responsibility, it was submitted, should be found on an extended joint criminal enterprise basis.
	


Special Circumstances


	
	In determining the question of special circumstances in relation to MG, the following matters must be taken into account.
	



	
	His youth (15 years 10 months at the date of the offence, presently 20 years of age).
	
	
	His positive behaviour in custody and program participation.
	
	
	The evident benefits to his rehabilitation of him entering an occupation in the community, having regard to his literary deficits as a matter of importance in his rehabilitation.
	
	
	His lack of criminal antecedents.
	



	
	These factors provide a basis for a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	The issue of special circumstances arising under s 44 of the Sentencing Act involves a discretionary exercise of power: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704, 718, per Spigelman CJ. The range for the proper exercise of the discretion as the Chief Justice observed in Simpson is required to take into account the gravity of the particular offence: at 718. I have, of course, had regard to the offence in question including the matters to which I have earlier referred namely the objective and subjective factors earlier discussed. Having done so, I have determined the ratios of the non-parole periods to the parole periods of each sentence as are reflected in the sentences I will impose.
	


Parity


	
	I turn to consider the application of the parity principle. That principle is of importance when sentencing each of the offenders and is not confined to sentences imposed upon co-offenders who have committed the same crime or offences. It can, in particular, be applied to sentences imposed upon persons who are co-offenders by virtue of having been engaged in the same criminal enterprise, regardless of the charges that have been actually laid against them: Green v R [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462; (2011) 86 ALJR 36 at [30]; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [136]. The principle is also to be applied where co-offenders in the same criminal enterprise have been convicted of different offences, as in the present proceedings where three co-offenders have been sentenced on the basis of the offence of manslaughter and three co-offenders are to be sentenced for the offence of murder: see Jimmy v R, supra, at [200].
	
	
	The High Court in Green, supra (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) observed that in relation to a case where there is no formal identity of charges against offenders whose sentences are compared, there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with separate crimes, a matter recognised by Campbell JA in Jimmy, supra, at [201]-[202] of his Honour’s judgment.
	
	
	Equal justice considerations which underlie the principle of parity need to be considered in order to ensure there is no unjustified disparity between the offenders’ sentences and the sentences imposed on co-offenders JP, JH and AN. Differences in their subjective circumstances will also need to be considered.
	
	
	In the present proceedings, I am required to consider the respective roles and respective culpability of each of the three offenders SB, AE and MG and additionally with due regard to the respective roles and culpability of their co-offenders, in particular JP and JH.
	
	
	As to the co-offenders, SB, AE and MG, on the evidence and the findings on the evidence which I have earlier set out, I have concluded that whilst there are some factual differences in their participation (including SB’s use of a pole) there does not, in my assessment, exist a sufficient basis in the evidence for differentiating the objective criminality of SB, AE and MG one from the other. They each were, as I have stated, participants in carrying out the joint criminal enterprise in the particular respects to which I have referred in para [56] of these remarks.
	
	
	I will refer to the subjective factors relevant to SB, AE and MG shortly.
	
	
	The issue of parity, as I have indicated, is to be considered having regard to the criminal liability of the co-offenders JP, JH and AN in respect of their respective convictions for the offence of manslaughter. Due consideration is required of their roles and participation in the criminal enterprise having regard to the established facts and events in their separate trials relevant to the objective seriousness of their manslaughter offences and the sentences imposed upon each of them.
	
	
	The co-offender AN entered a guilty plea to the offence of manslaughter, which was accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment: R v AN [2014] NSWSC 1879. On the Agreed Facts it was not part of AN’s liability that he had physically attacked the deceased. He was present and was taken as willing and able to assist physically if needed and thereby encouraged or assisted others [10].
	
	
	The Crown submission on sentence was that his culpability was at the lower end of the hierarch at [39]. He was given a 15% discount on sentence for his guilty plea: at [81].
	
	
	Subjective factors were significant in that his father died when AN was 15 years of age which event had affected his life to an extreme extent, occasioning stress: at [69]-[70]. He was assessed as having good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The role of the co-offender JP was significant and his actions in attacking Eden Delir, and then smashing the bottle over his head which caused injury to the brain, and ultimately death, was objectively extremely serious. He did that in the course of what was found to have been a coordinated attack although the planning for it only commenced a short time before the attack. The objective seriousness of JP’s role and participation in the events in relation to which six co-offenders have now been convicted, I consider to have been of a higher order than that of the offenders SB, AE and MG and of AN who, as I have stated, entered a guilty plea.
	
	
	The moral culpability of the co-offender JH was at a higher level than that of the three offenders who now stand for sentence. On the evidence in his trial, JH acted on an understanding that Eden Delir had “snitched” to police about his (JH’s) role in the February 2010 attack. JH was involved in the decision to launch the group attack on Eden Delir. On the evidence he encouraged the other co-offenders to do so. On those bases, his moral responsibility was determined at sentence to have been at a high level. JH’s actions it was clear were motivated by his intention to inflict physical punishment upon Eden Delir as a form of retribution or revenge for having spoken to police about the February 2010 attack.
	
	
	Whilst the primary Crown case against the co-offenders JP and JH was that they were each a party to a joint criminal enterprise to inflict grievous bodily harm, the juries in the respective trials of each clearly were not satisfied on the evidence that the infliction of grievous bodily harm was in fact within the agreement.
	
	
	In relation to subjective factors, in JP’s case, whilst it was found that he had some rehabilitation prospects, it was difficult on the evidence to say how strong those prospects were: R v JP [2014] NSWSC 698 at [132]. Additionally, whilst it was accepted that he showed some remorse as to what had occurred it was found to be difficult to assess its extent or level: ROS at [121].
	
	
	In JH’s case, his rehabilitation prospects were assessed, with caution, as moderate: R v JH [2014] NSWSC 1845 at [106]. The conclusion was expressed that he had not shown any genuine remorse or contrition: ROS at [87].
	
	
	In my assessment, SB, AE and MG each have stronger subjective cases than either the co-offender JP or the co-offender JH.
	
	
	In applying the parity principle in this case, in addition to the matters to which I have referred, whilst the evidence in the joint trial of SB, AE and MG established that JP had a bottle in his hand when he joined the group at the front of the premises followed by some conversation with other members of the group, by my assessment there was no evidence capable of establishing to the criminal standard that SB, AE or MG knew that JP would or might use the bottle as a weapon as he did. In so concluding I have not lost sight of the fact that, on the evidence, each of the three offenders may well have seen JP holding the bottle and additionally the fact that the members of the attacking group (including SB, AE and MG) continued with the attack on Eden Delir apparently undeterred by the bottle having been brutally used as a weapon in the way it was used. Absent direct and/or inferential evidence on that matter capable of proving, to the requisite standard, knowledge in one or other of the three offenders as to JP’s intentions before the attack began, SB, AE and/or MG cannot be found to have in fact had forewarning of JP’s intentions. The evidence did not establish that SB, AE or MG in fact had such knowledge to the requisite standard. The evidence established, as I have previously stated, in accordance with the jury’s verdict, that SB, AE and MG had in contemplation that one of more might inflict grievous bodily harm on Eden Delir.
	
	
	So far as the co-offender JH is concerned, of the group his role as an instigator of the attack is also distinguishable from that of SB, AE and MG and differentiated in terms of objective seriousness as I have previously discussed.
	
	
	Though SB, AE and MG were willing parties in the criminal enterprise, each were, in carrying it out, at least in part, acting at JH’s instigation or by reason of his encouragement.
	
	
	Accordingly, the matters to which I have referred are required to be considered in determining the application of the parity principle along with the fact that the offences of co-offenders JP and JH were assessed on sentencing as extremely grave manslaughter offences R v JP Remarks on Sentence at [105] and R v JH Remarks on Sentence at [132].
	
	
	In the present case the offence of murder with which each of the offenders SB, AE and MG have been convicted is, of course, a more serious crime than that of their co-offenders, JP and JH’s convictions for manslaughter. That is an important matter to bring into account in the application of the parity principle, along with the roles and participation of all co-offenders (including JH’s role in instigating the criminal enterprise and JP’s role in inflicting injury which was the substantial cause of death).
	
	
	In determining the sentences to be imposed I am required to consider the objective and subjective factors relevant to the offence committed by each of the offenders and the aggravating and mitigating factors in accordance with the provisions of s 21A of the Sentencing Act and relevant sentencing principles. I have closely considered those factors so far as relevant to the case of each offender.
	


Principles Relevant to Sentencing Young Offenders


	
	The relevant principles are well-established and play an important role in the sentencing of young offenders.
	
	
	Section 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 sets out legislative guidelines relating to the exercise of functions under the Act.
	
	
	The case law principles establish a number of additional considerations. They include:
	



	
	That the considerations of general deterrence and the principles of retribution are, in most cases, of less significance than they would be when sentencing an adult for the same offence.
	
	
	There is a need to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation.
	
	
	Cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity in a young person, it is recognised, contributes to their breach of the law. Allowance is to be made for an offender’s youth and not just their biological age.
	
	
	Where the immaturity of the offender is a significant factor in the commission of the offence, the criminality will be less than if the same offence was committed by an adult.
	



	
	See e.g. R v AEM (Snr) [2002] NSWCCA 58; R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 at 458-9; KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51 at [20]-[26].
	
	
	There is confirmation in the Background Reports in relation to each of the offenders identifying a number of factors relevant to their rehabilitation prospects. These include in each case positive signs of progress in custody, which is consistent with an increase in maturity and constructive early steps towards rehabilitation. I have had regard to such matters in determining special circumstances and the extent of the variation to be made in the statutory ratio of non-parole to the total term of sentence to be imposed. The elimination of negative peer influences in the future is likely to enhance the rehabilitation prospects of each offender.
	


Victim Impact Statements


	
	In these proceedings, Victim Impact Statements prepared by the parents and the sister of Eden Delir were received by the Court. The statements express in clear and very dignified terms the grievous effect and the immense loss arising from the death of Eden Delir and the impact it has had upon each of them. The loss of a young person in the circumstances with which this case is concerned is exceptionally painful and tragic. On behalf of the Court I extend my condolences to the family of the deceased for the immense loss that they have endured and that they will continue to endure. Nothing of course can address that immense loss.
	
	
	I have noted the provisions of Division 2 (Victim Impact Statements) of Part 3 of the Sentencing Act, in particular, s 28 thereof. I have, of course, closely considered the victim impact statements in this case as significant material before the Court. I have determined the sentence to be imposed on the basis of the evidence and findings to which I have referred above. As there were no submissions made in relation to s 28, I have determined that any sentence should not be increased by virtue of the statements to which Division 2 applies in this case.
	


Bail Conditions


	
	In accordance with accepted sentencing principles it is open to a sentencing judge to take into account onerous conditions of bail in assessing sentence, but he or she is not obliged to do so: R v Webb [2004] NSWCCA 330; 149 A Crim R 167 at [19] per Grove J, Simpson and Shaw JJ agreeing.
	
	
	In R v Fowler [2003] NSWCCA 321, the Court (Tobias JA, James and Howie JJ) observed:
	


“242   We accept that in an appropriate case the length and terms of an offender’s period on bail awaiting trial or sentence is a matter relevant to the determination of the proper sentence to be imposed. What weight is to be given to such a matter will vary from case to case, depending upon what other factors need to be considered and what sentence is required in the particular case to address the purpose of punishment. Where that purpose is the protection of the community and the conditions of bail are particularly onerous, such as where the offender has been required to reside at a rehabilitation establishment, very significant weight might be placed upon such a factor where it is appropriate having regard to the nature of the offence. However, in other cases, less weight may be given to such consideration, particularly where the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment is required for the purposes of denouncing the crime and reflecting the general deterrence.”


	
	In that case, the Court determined that there had been an obvious and significant disruption to the appellant’s life and restrictions upon his liberty over a lengthy period of time as a result of the offence committed. However, it was held that the sentencing judge was not required to reduce the sentence because of such considerations: at [243].
	
	
	See also R v Dennis (NSWCCA, 14 December 1992, unreported); R v Khamas (1999) 108 A Crim R 499 at [27].
	
	
	I have had regard to the bail conditions tendered on behalf of each of the offenders and have noted the restrictions that were imposed upon each of them. I accept that the conditions requiring that a nominated person accompany a person on bail when out of his home is a stringent condition. However, I do not consider that a condition of that kind, nor the other conditions specified in the bail undertakings given by the offenders, constituted such a severe restriction as to attract the case law principles to which I have referred. I do not consider that the sentences to be imposed should be reduced on the basis of the bail conditions imposed on each offender.
	


Sentencing as a Juvenile Offender


	
	In certain circumstances, if a court sentences a person under 21 years of age to imprisonment for an indictable offence it may direct that the whole or any part of the term of the sentence be served as a juvenile offender: s 19(1) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.
	
	
	Section 19(3) of the lastmentioned Act provides that a person who is sentenced to imprisonment in respect of a serious children’s indictable offence (as in the present case) is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after the person has attained the age of 18 years unless one or other of the matters set out in subparagraphs (a), (b) or (c) are satisfied.
	
	
	The eligibility to serve a sentence of imprisonment imposed in respect of a serious children’s indictable offence as a juvenile offender after a person has attained the age of 18 years, in this case, would depend upon whether or not a finding of special circumstances can and is made under s 19(4) of the Act (in particular, subparagraphs (a) or (b) or (c) thereof).
	
	
	In respect of the offender SB, a Juvenile Justice Report written by Phoebe Mitsik and Sarah Abusharif dated 18 March 2015 was tendered at the sentencing hearing on 27 March 2015.
	
	
	In respect of the offender AE, a Juvenile Justice Report written by Tim Warton and Helena Greeks dated 25 March 2015 was tendered at the hearing on 27 March 2015.
	
	
	In respect of the offender MG, a Juvenile Justice report written by Stephanie Wong and Sarah Abusharif dated 19 March 2015 was tendered at the hearing on 27 March 2015. Mr Steel on behalf of MG also relied on a report prepared by Dr Olav Nielssen dated 11 March 2015 which dealt with MG’s mental health and rehabilitation needs. Dr Nielssen in this report indicated his belief that MG would be more likely to receive specialist supported education relevant to his learning disabilities in juvenile detention than in an adult facility.
	
	
	The Juvenile Justice reports tendered on 27 March 2015 were relied upon by counsel for each of the offenders in addition to the Juvenile Justice background reports previously tendered on 6 March 2015 to establish a basis for making a finding of special circumstances. The reports, in particular, dealt with the education facilities and benefits available in juvenile detention centres which are unlikely to be available in adult facilities as well as therapeutic and vocational programs which may have an impact upon the offenders’ prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	It was acknowledged by the Crown in oral submissions on sentence that there was material in the reports tendered in relation to AE and MG sufficient for an order to be made under s 19(4). In relation to SB, the Crown submitted that an order should be made because SB was completing his secondary studies in juvenile detention and would be unable to do so in an adult prison (T 27 March 2015: 44).
	
	
	I consider that the evidence tendered on this question in relation to each offender establishes that special circumstances exist in terms of s 19.
	
	
	A finding of special circumstances under s 19, of course, does not permit an order to be made that goes beyond the offender’s 21st birthday.
	


Sentencing Orders


	
	I note that the sentences to be imposed are to be backdated in respect of each offender to take account of time spent in pre-sentence custody, particulars of which are as follows:
	
	
	SB was in custody, bail refused, between 19 October 2011 and 17 September 2013, a total of 1 year, 10 months and 29 days. He was then released on bail until the date of his conviction, 21 November 2014.
	
	
	AE and MG were each in pre-sentence custody for one day prior to being released on bail on 20 October 2011. AE was returned to custody following his conviction on 21 November 2014. MG was returned to custody following his conviction on 26 November 2014.
	
	
	SB, you are convicted of the offence of murder. I sentence you to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 8 years to date from 23 December 2012 and to expire on 22 December 2020. There will be a parole period of 4 years to commence on 23 December 2020 and to expire on 22 December 2024. Accordingly, the head sentence is a term of imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 8 years. The first date upon which you will be eligible to be released to parole accordingly will be on 23 December 2020.
	
	
	AE, you are convicted of the offence of murder. I sentence you to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 8 years to date from 20 November 2014 and to expire on 19 November 2022. There will be a parole period of 4 years to commence on 20 November 2022, to expire on 19 November 2026. Accordingly, the head sentence is a term of imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment of 8 years. The first date upon which you will be eligible to be released to parole accordingly will be on 20 November 2022.
	
	
	MG, you are convicted of the offence of murder. I sentence you to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 8 years to date from 25 November 2014 and to expire on 24 November 2022. There will be a parole period of 4 years to commence on 25 November 2022 and to expire on 24 November 2026. Accordingly, the head sentence is a term of imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years. The first date upon which you will be eligible to be released to parole accordingly will be on 25 November 2022.
	
	
	I make an order in relation to each offender pursuant to s 19(1) and 19(3) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, that the offenders, SB, MG and AE serve their non-parole periods of the respective sentences imposed as a juvenile offender until the day upon which each attains the age of 21 years.

		19 June 2015",2015-04-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2424787,R v Duffy (No. 5) [2015] NSWSC 528,"Judgment


	
	The Crown seeks leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) to cross-examine the witness Cathy Adamson in relation paragraphs 7 to 15 of her police statement.
	
	
	The witness was asked about a meeting that she had with the Accused and Rachael Evans a few weeks before she made a statement to the police on 4 June 2012. She said in her evidence that she recalled being in Bradbury, she recalled speaking to the Accused and Ms Evans, that they met outside where she was living and that they walked up to a park. She did not remember anything else.
	
	
	The Crown then sought leave to have the witness refresh her memory from her statement. That was not opposed by Mr Trevallion.
	
	
	She was asked to read paragraphs 7 to 15 to herself. She said she did not even recall making a statement to the police but she recognised her signature. She was asked if reading the statement revived her memory about she had said in that statement. She said that it did not but she remembered walking up the road and “Rachael carrying on about Monique”. The statement contained a reference in paragraph 9 to Rachael talking about Monique.
	
	
	The witness was again asked if reading the paragraphs of the statement enabled her to remember what happened but she said that she did not. In those circumstances the Crown made application under s 38.
	
	
	The application was put on the basis of s 38(1)(b). Section 38(1) provides:
	


38 Unfavourable witnesses

(1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about:

(a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party, or

(b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence, or

(c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement.


	
	The Crown asserted that the witness might reasonably be supposed to have knowledge about the meeting concerning the guns but was not making a genuine attempt to give that evidence. The basis for asserting that she was not making a genuine attempt was simply that the events were said to be unusual, namely, the request to see if she could sell the guns, and the fact that the police statement was made only a matter of three to four weeks after the meeting took place.
	
	
	Mr Trevallion did not oppose the leave being given under s 38 but submitted that the only basis which had been established was that the evidence of the witness was unfavourable evidence.
	
	
	What the witness said in her statement to the police was relevantly this:
	


7. About 3 or 4 weeks ago I received either a phone call or a text message from Duffy just before midnight. This occurred days prior to my appointment at the First Care Medical Centre in Bradbury. I cannot remember the date. He asked me to meet up with him. I told him to meet me in Bradbury and he asked me if I had any fits on me. When I say fits I am referring to syringes. I told him that I only had old ones. I told him that I would leave now.

8. My partner and I left home and walked along The Parkway Bradbury, past the Bradbury Hotel and met up with Rachael and Duffy who were walking towards us. It took us about a ten minute walk to meet them.

9. At the time Rachael and I were not talking because of a previous incident where she had made a nasty comment about my son. Rachael appeared happy as she was smiling and did not have a care in the world. She was off her face meaning she had been using drugs. I noticed that her pupils were huge. However to me she was more than just off her face. There was some big joke I did not know about and she kept mentioning 'Monique Monique'. When she stated this she kept looking at Duffy and giggling.

10. I hugged and kissed Duffy when I saw him. Duffy appeared buggered and told that he had been doing heaps of walking.

11. I describe Rachael as wearing a white knitted beanie on her head, her hair was out from underneath the beanie, bright red hair, she was wearing makeup, a fawn brown leather jacket with a triangular collar, long sleeved, tight fitted, with stud buttons and a zipper, long black tights and brown sandals/thongs with blue stones.

12. I describe Duffy as wearing a dark jackets (sic) and dark pants. I cannot describe him any further.

13. Rachael was carrying two bags, one bag was in her left hand and the other bag on her right should (sic), as I could see the strap around her should (sic) and she had her hand around the strap. The bags appeared full to me as the bags had shape to them meaning they were full to the brim. The bags were not her usual bag as she usually has a black Harley Davidson bag.

14. Duffy was carrying two bags, one over his right shoulder with his hand around the strap and the other bag in his left hand. I believe one of those bags belonged to Rachael. I do not remember the bags he was carrying to be bulky.

15. I remember having a conversation with them when we met. One of them asked if I knew anybody who was interested in any 'gats'. I know 'gats' to mean guns. I said, ""Yeah why?"" Rachael said, ""We got a couple."" I said, ""Bullshit"". I looked at Duffy and he said, ""Yeah."" When he stated this he rolled his right shoulder, the same shoulder that had a bag strap over it He stated, ""A long one"". When he stated this he moved his hand down his left leg. This meant to me he was talking about a long gun like a shotgun or rifle.


	
	A number of matters suggested to me that it could not be demonstrated that the witness was not making a genuine attempt to give evidence. First, she did not simply keep stating that she did not remember anything about the event. Before she was shown the statement she gave evidence that she recalled the occasion and that they met outside where she lived and walked up to the park.
	
	
	Secondly, after having been shown the statement she additionally remembered that Rachael had been “carrying on about Monique” as a result of reading that in the statement. Thirdly, because of her alleged involvement in the sale of the guns I raised with counsel and subsequently the witness the issue of self-incrimination and s 128 of the Evidence Act. The witness could have claimed that the evidence would tend to incriminate her with the result that the procedure in s 128 would have needed to be followed. She did not do that and indicated that she was prepared to give evidence.
	
	
	In those circumstances, I could not be satisfied that the preconditions in s 38(1)(b) were satisfied.
	
	
	However, the evidence that she gave to the Crown was that she could not remember the conversation beyond the evidence she had given because her memory was bad. That evidence was unfavourable evidence. I referred to the discussion of the broad nature of the term “unfavourable evidence” in R v Duffy (No. 3) [2015] NSWSC 481 at [8]-[9].
	
	
	That an inability to remember facts contained in a previous statement might constitute unfavourable evidence tends to be supported by s 32(3) of the Act which provides:
	


If a witness has, while giving evidence, used a document to try to revive his or her memory about a fact or opinion, the witness may, with the leave of the court, read aloud, as part of his or her evidence, so much of the document as relates to that fact or opinion.


	
	In the present case the witness has used her statement to try to revive her memory about a fact, namely the conversation that took place at the meeting she had with the accused and Ms Evans a few weeks before her statement was made. In those circumstances the witness is, with leave, entitled to read aloud as part of her evidence so much of the statement as relates to that fact. In the same way, the Crown Prosecutor is entitled in cross-examination under s 38 to put what is contained in the statement to the witness in an endeavour to obtain the witness’s agreement that the facts recorded actually took place.
	
	
	For these reasons, leave is granted pursuant to s 38(1)(a) to cross-examine the witness concerning paragraphs 7-15 of her statement.

		25 May 2015",2015-05-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2424895,James v R [2015] NSWCCA 97,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed in the District Court on 4 November 2011 after a jury convicted him of sixteen offences relating to the possession and transmission of multiple still images and multimedia files of child pornography or child abuse material contrary to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (“the transmission counts”) and the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (“the possession count”). He was also convicted of using a carriage service to cause offence contrary to s 474.17(1) of the Criminal Code Act (“the Criminal Code”).
	
	
	The first of the transmission offences, committed on 13 April 2010, attracted a maximum penalty of 10 years under s 474.19(1)(a)(iii) of the Criminal Code with the balance of the transmission offences, committed on various days between 2 May 2010 and 2 June 2010, committed in breach of the same section, attracting a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for that offence was increased from 10 to 15 years by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Offences Against Children) Act 2010 (Cth), effective from 15 April 2010.
	
	
	The possession count brought under s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act attracted a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and the use of a carriage service to cause offence contrary to s 474.17(1) of the Criminal Code a maximum of 3 years imprisonment.
	
	
	On the possession count the sentencing judge imposed a fixed term of 4 years to commence on 14 November 2011, accumulated by two months on a fixed term of 1 year on the count relating to use of a carriage service to cause offence. A sentence of 3 years and 8 months imprisonment was imposed on the first of the fifteen transmission offences which was accumulated by two months on the possession count, with each of the remaining fourteen transmission offences attracting sentences of varying lengths between 5 years and 6 months and 6 years and 3 months, each accumulated by one month on the immediately preceding offence in time. This resulted in an overall accumulation of 18 months across the seventeen counts (with a total sentence for the transmission offences being 6 years and 8 months). After partial accumulation with the possession count, a total effective sentence of 7 years and 1 month was imposed with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months.
	
	
	The applicant relies upon three grounds of appeal:
	


1.    His Honour erred in assessing the objective seriousness of each of counts 1 to 15 as being within the mid range of objective seriousness:

a.    His Honour erred in taking into account the fact that there were 800 different children depicted when assessing the objective seriousness of counts 1-15;

b.    His Honour erred in finding that transmitting child pornography was more serious than soliciting child pornography;

c.    His Honour erred in taking into account the possibility that the images transmitted may be further on published by the recipient.

2.    His Honour erred in assessing the objective seriousness of count 17 as being within the mid range of objective seriousness.

3.    The head sentences and non-parole periods are manifestly excessive.


	
	In November 2013, Emmett JA delivered the Court’s preliminary judgment in which it was observed:
	


“In relation to ground 1, which rather subsumed the argument in relation to the others, the applicant submitted that although the sentencing judge adopted the approach of imposing individual sentences for each of the 15 offences he did so referable to the number of child pornography files transmitted irrespective of whether they were images or multimedia files. It was submitted that the sentencing judge thereby failed to take into account a factor relevant to an assessment of objective seriousness of offences of the relevant kind.

It was accepted in argument that the evidence lead on sentence, while in all other respects comprehensive, did not allow for any factual findings of that specific kind to be made since the actual content of relevant files was not in evidence. The sentencing judge expressly observed that while he had information about how many images were transmitted in respect to each offence he did not have information about the range of categories over which those categories were spread so far as each individual offence was concerned.

It is difficult to see how a finding of mid range offending could be made without that evidence. However, it does not necessarily follow that the individual sentences are infected with error for that reason or that without that evidence a finding of low range offending was mandated.

The Court has concluded that the graduated individual sentences imposed for the transmission offences in the absence of any evidence as to the content of the files transmitted in each count are suggestive of error in the sense that the individual sentence or at least some of them appear to be excessive, because of the accumulation of one month over each of the transmission offences and excessive sentence on one of the transmission counts might have an effect on the total sentence imposed and a re­sentencing exercise may be warranted for that reason, the more so the error had infected all of the transmission counts.

It was agreed at the conclusion of argument that were the Court to reacha concluded view that the sentences for the transmission offences were suggestive of error the Court may not ultimately be called upon to re-sentence if, after further consideration of the available evidence, the application elected to lead no further evidence on re-sentence to establish error.

We have formed the view that the sentences for the transmission offences are indeed suggestive of error. Accordingly, the appropriate course would be for the applicant to be given the opportunity to decide whether to adduce further evidence on re-sentencing. If, however, no further evidence were to be adduced to demonstrate error the application would be dismissed.”


	
	The matter subsequently came before Fullerton J in December 2013 and February 2014, when further directions were given. The matter remained in the Registrar’s call over list until November 2014, when it was adjourned to 8 May for further hearing. With the consent of the parties the Bench was later reconstituted.
	
	
	It was only on 8 May 2015, that it came to the attention of the Bench that the parties had filed affidavits and submissions in accordance with Fullerton J’s directions, in March and April 2014. How this regrettable delay occurred, is not apparent to the Bench. The appeal ought to have been disposed of, once this material was filed. In the circumstances of this case, fortunately, the delay has had no impact on the outcome of the appeal.
	


The facts and findings for sentencing purposes


	
	During May 2010 an officer of the Australian Federal Police opened a Facebook account under a fictitious name and posed as a 14 year old girl. Between 13 May and 26 May the applicant communicated with the police officer via his Facebook account, believing the police officer was a 14 year old girl. The account features a thumbnail photograph of the applicant. In the chat log of his contact with the police officer the applicant makes reference to sexual activity with another girl of the same age and makes reference to his sexual preference for young girls. This activity grounded the offence under s 474.17(1) of the Criminal Code, namely, using a carriage service in a way that a reasonable person would regard as offensive.
	
	
	His communications with the police officer precipitated the execution of a search warrant on 15 June 2010 at the premises where the applicant was residing, at the time of his contact with the police officer.
	
	
	A Dell laptop computer belonging to the applicant was seized from those premises and subsequently analysed. It was found to contain numerous images and multimedia files of children (from infants to young adolescents), and included material in each of the five categories of child pornography referable to the COPINE typology - an internationally recognised graduated scale of seriousness from 1 to 5 reflecting the sexual activity customarily encountered in the investigation and prosecution of offences involving child pornography. The applicant’s computer also contained 36 images of him in various states of undress.
	
	
	A search of premises at which the applicant was residing at the time the warrant was executed was undertaken, and a blade computer tower located in his bedroom. It was seized by police and subsequently analysed. It also contained numerous child pornography images and multimedia files of children in the same age range and across each of the five COPINE categories of sexual activity.
	
	
	Three of the applicant’s email accounts were subsequently identified by police, each of which used variations of the name “wishmaster”. They were accessed by police. Multiple child pornography images and multimedia files, again within each of the five COPINE categories, were found to have been transmitted by the applicant via these accounts. Of these, fifteen emails sent over a six-week period between 15 April and 2 June 2010 to ten different addresses were the subject of the transmission offences, two of which were sent to the undercover police officer, of which one contained 123 flies - the largest single attachment of child pornography. (His Honour’s reference to fifteen different recipients in his sentencing remarks was an error and conceded to be such by the Crown.) The applicant also attached images of himself to some emails, some of which included sexually suggestive text.
	
	
	The material on both computers totalled in excess of 2000 child pornography images and multimedia files. A breakdown of the exact numbers of files in each of the transmission offences and the possession offence, and a breakdown of the number of files in each of the five COPINE categories was included in the Crown submissions on sentence.
	
	
	For sentencing purposes his Honour calculated the number of individual (that is, not duplicated) child pornography images in the applicant’s possession to be 1675, the number of multimedia flies as 182 and the number of children photographed or filmed in the material at about 800, with the majority aged between 6 and 14 years.
	


Factual findings for sentencing purposes


	
	His Honour was satisfied that there was no commercial aspect to the applicant’s offending and that the greater concentration of files he possessed and transmitted were in the lowest category of activity on the COPINE scale, namely images depicting children in erotic poses. (While this finding was supported by the evidence of the police who analysed the material, we note that files in categories 3 and 4, being respectively non-penetrative and penetrative sexual activity between adults and children, were numbered in the hundreds.) The sentencing judge regarded this number as not insignificant. He also took into account the impact of the exploitation and abuse of children entailed in the offending (see R v Booth [2009] NSWCCA 89 at [40]-[42]) and the importance of the sentence operating in a meaningful way as a deterrent and to denounce and punish the offender for his conduct (see R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; 162 A Crim R 29 at [27]).
	
	
	His Honour found that the possession charge reflected offending at the lower end of mid range offending and the offensive use of a carriage service contrary to s 474.17(1) of the Criminal Code also as offending in the low range. While he accepted that the person the applicant communicated with in committing that offence was not a child, he also noted that the applicant believed the person to be a child and that the contact extended over a two week period. His Honour found each of the transmission offences to be an example of mid range offending and that they were each objectively more serious than accessing child pornography, or causing it to be transmitted to oneself, contrary to subsections (i) and (ii) of s 474.19(1)(a), and possibly more serious than soliciting receipt of pornographic material contrary to subsection (iv), because of the risk of the material being further published by those to whom it was transmitted. That finding, referable to the number of children depicted in the images transmitted being 800, was said to have been wrongly taken into account in the finding that the offending constituted by each of the transmission offences fell in the mid range of objective seriousness. His Honour imposed graduated sentences for the transmission offences according to the differing numbers of images transmitted, with between 2 and 10 images attracting a sentence of 5 years and 6 months; 11 and 25 images a sentence of 5 years and 9 months; 26 and 40 images a sentence of 6 years; and images in excess of 40 a sentence of 6 years and 3 months. This approach is also said by the applicant to reflect error because it failed to discriminate between both the type of file transmitted (that is, between single images or multimedia files - the latter being logically of either a short or long duration) and did not include any categorisation of any of the files according to the COPINE scale.

(Note: We have included in the third column a breakdown of the number of child pornography files the subject of each count into single image and multimedia files. This is based upon the evidence before the sentencing judge (AB 69-71) but not the subject of comment in his Honour’s sentencing remarks. We also note the Crown’s concession that consistent with his Honour’s approach in imposing graduated sentences, count 3 (which involved the transmission of 22 images) should have attracted a sentence of 5 years and 9 months, and not 6 years.)

The applicant’s case on sentence


	
	The applicant did not give evidence at his trial relying upon his denials to police in an ERISP. In a pre-sentence report tendered on sentence he maintained his denials. Unsurprisingly, in the absence of any evidence of contrition his Honour regarded the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation as limited. There is no challenge to that finding.
	
	
	The applicant was 28 at the time of sentence. He had no criminal record. Although he was unemployed at the time of sentence, he had a past working record as an unskilled labourer. He reported a stable relationship with his mother with whom he resided at the time of sentence, and with his siblings. He also reported being subjected to violence at the hand of his stepfather as a child. He was in regular telephone contact with his father after renewing that relationship in his early adolescence.
	
	
	The applicant tendered a medical report relating to his infant son who suffers a disability and who requires high level care. Although the child was in the full-time care of his mother, the applicant’s former partner, at the time of sentence he continued to be involved in his son’s daily care. His Honour acknowledged the impact a prison sentence would likely have on his infant children and the additional burden that his former partner would have to bear in having sole care of his son, but did not regard it as ameliorating the sentence to be imposed. There is no challenge to that finding.
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred in assessing the objective seriousness of each of counts 1 to 15 as being within the mid range of objective seriousness:

a.    His Honour erred in taking into account the fact that there were 800 different children depicted when assessing the objective seriousness of counts 1-15;

b.    His Honour erred in finding that transmitting child pornography was more serious than soliciting child pornography;

c.    His Honour erred in taking into account the possibility that images transmitted may be further on published by the recipient.


	
	There are two aspects of the first ground of appeal although, to a large extent, they are interrelated. The first concerns what is said to be error in his Honour’s global assessment of the objective seriousness of the fifteen transmission offences within the mid range without examining each individual count and assessing the objective seriousness constituted by that offending. The second aspect identifies particular errors said to have impacted upon the way his Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offending (viewed globally).
	
	
	Before considering the submissions of counsel it is appropriate to observe that the range of factors relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the transmission and dissemination of child pornography under the Criminal Code (together with possession offences both under the Criminal Code and under the Crimes Act) have been the subject of both restatement, elaboration and refinement in Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140; 201 A Crim R 243. At [94] RA Hulme J enumerated a non-exhaustive list of factors of significance are as follows:
	


1.    Whether actual children were used in the creation of the material.

2.    The nature and content of the material, including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed.

3.    The extent of any cruelty or physical harm occasioned to the children that may be discernible from the material.

4.    The number of images or items of material – in a case of possession, the significance lying more in the number of different children depicted.

5.    In a case of possession, the offender’s purpose, whether for his/her own use or for sale or dissemination. In this regard, care is needed to avoid any infringement of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383.

6.    In a case of dissemination/transmission, the number of persons to whom the material was disseminated/transmitted.

7.    Whether any payment or other material benefit (including the exchange of child pornographic material) was made, provided or received for the acquisition or dissemination/transmission.

8.    The proximity of the offender’s activities to those responsible for bringing the material into existence.

9.    The degree of planning, organisation or sophistication employed by the offender in acquiring, storing, disseminating or transmitting the material.

10.    Whether the offender acted alone or in a collaborative network of like-minded persons.

11.    Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by vulnerable persons, particularly children.

12.    Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by persons susceptible to act in the manner described or depicted.

13.    Any other matter in s 21A(2) or (3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (for State offences) or s 16A Crimes Act 1914 (for Commonwealth offences) bearing upon the objective seriousness of the offence.


	
	The discrete factual findings under challenge in Grounds 1(a), (b) and (c) need to be considered referable to the different conduct encompassed by s 474.19(1)(a)(i)-(iv) of the Criminal Code. That conduct includes using a carriage service to access child pornography material (subsection (i)); to transmit it to oneself (subsection (ii)); to transmit, make available, publish, distribute, advertise or promote the material (subsection (iii)); and soliciting the material (subsection (iv)).
	
	
	As we understand the submission of counsel in support of Ground 1(a), it is not that the number of children depicted in the material was irrelevant to an assessment of objective seriousness when the offences were viewed as part of a course of conduct over some weeks, but that his Honour took the number of children into account when assessing the objective seriousness of each of the transmission offences in a way that offends the principle in R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383; 5 A Crim R 329. The Crown submitted that, properly understood, that finding, as with the other findings the subject of complaint under the first ground of appeal, was not utilised by his Honour in the assessment of the objective seriousness of each offence but as one of a number of overlapping features of the applicant’s offending in possessing and transmitting the material viewed as a course of conduct and, on that basis, properly taken into account on sentence in recognition of the fact that “…the significance of quantity [of images] lies more in the number of different children who are depicted and thereby victimised” as was emphasised in Gent by Johnson J at [99].
	
	
	Although fifteen separate transmission offences were committed, necessarily requiring separate sentences in an “offence specific approach” before consideration was given to questions of concurrency or accumulation (see Cargnello v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2012] NSWCCA 162 per Basten JA at [94]), the Crown submitted it was open to his Honour to regard the offending as part of a course of conduct over six weeks.
	
	
	It was that feature of the offending upon which the Crown placed significant reliance in meeting the applicant’s submission that the individual sentences (or at least some of them) were excessive and ultimately productive of a total sentence that was unreasonable and plainly unjust. We will return to consider the impact of that submission later in this judgment.
	
	
	In so far as concerns matter (b) in Ground 1, it seems to me to be a self evident proposition that transmitting child pornography to other users (who, it was open to infer in this case, were deliberately anonymised to avoid being identified) carries with it an obvious risk that the material transmitted will be disseminated beyond the named recipient and shared with other internet users who have the same deviant interest and, for that reason, a matter bearing upon the objective seriousness in the non-exhaustive catalogue of factors identified by RA Hulme J in Minehan. We can discern no error in the sentencing judge’s reference to that fact as one of the features relating to the course of conduct in which the applicant engaged in committing the transmission offences.
	
	
	In so far as concerns matter (c) in Ground 1, the applicant submitted that s 474.19(1)(a)(i)-(iv) proscribes conduct in an ascending order of seriousness and, accordingly, his Honour was in error in finding that soliciting child pornography material in subsection (iv) is offending of greater objective seriousness than transmitting the material to either oneself (subsection (ii)) or, relevantly for present purposes, to others (subsection (iii)). In his remarks on sentence his Honour said:
	


[12]    Next, I take into account that, so far as the offence of transmitting child pornography is concerned, it seems to me to be a more serious example of the crime against s 474.19(1)(a) than some of the other ways in which the crime may be committed. For example, it would be more serious in my opinion than accessing material or causing the material to be transmitted to himself. It may be more serious than soliciting the material. It is more serious because the material does not remain with Mr James to be viewed or accessed. It is actually sent beyond him to somebody else so it is shared with at least one other person that Mr James knows of. He then has no control over its further dissemination. For that reason I regard the way in which he committed the crimes against s 474.19(1)(a) as serious examples of that crime.

[13]    …

[14]    Next, I take into account the submissions made by Ms Grimes in her written submissions about the children involved in the material which was located and related to Mr James. It involved children ranging from infants through to about fifteen years of age. The Federal Police estimated that there would be about 800 different children depicted. They were mostly girls aged between six and fourteen.


	
	The construction of s 474.19(1)(a) for which the applicant contends is not mandated by the terms in which the provision is drafted. Counsel did not refer the Court to any authority to support the construction for which he contended. In my view, the objective seriousness of an offence committed in breach of the section, referable to conduct of the proscribed kind in a particular case, depends upon an infinite range of facts and circumstances, and not to any implied relative ordering of the conduct in the way the section is drafted.
	
	
	We turn now to consider what emerged in the course of the initial hearing as to the applicant’s primary complaint under the first ground of appeal. In the way the argument was then developed, this elided with the submissions directed to the second and third grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that although his Honour adopted an “offence specific approach” imposing individual sentences for each of the fifteen transmission offences, he did so, exclusively referable to the number of child pornography files transmitted irrespective of whether they were images or multimedia files. By limiting his assessment in that way, so it was submitted, he failed to assess the objective gravity of each offence referable to a categorisation of the child pornography files against the COPINE scale, and in that way failed to take into account a factor relevant to an assessment of objective seriousness of the offending (as to which see factors 2 and 3 in Minehan at [24]).
	
	
	It was then common ground that the evidence led on sentence, while in all other respects comprehensive, did not allow for his Honour to make any factual findings of that specific kind. Although the evidence allowed for a differentiation between the number of files containing single images and those containing images in a multimedia format, namely in a video or digital format (as reflected in the table at [18] above) the content of those files, categorised according to the COPINE scale, was not in evidence. The evidence did include a classification of all of the material seized according to the COPINE scale, and some examples, by description, of the sexual activity in each category, but that classification was referable to the total number of images and multimedia files in each of the five categories which included many hundreds of images of child pornography in the applicant’s possession that were not transmitted.
	
	
	On sentencing neither the Crown nor counsel for the applicant, considered it necessary to refer his Honour to the trial evidence of the content of the images or multimedia files that were transmitted for the purpose of sentence, whether referable to their classification of the COPINE scale or otherwise. This may have been because at trial the applicant admitted that all the files the subject of the counts with which he was charged constituted child pornography, as defined. In any event, it also appears that on sentence both parties simply accepted that each of the five COPINE categories were represented in the 182 child pornography files transmitted which, together with other features of the offending, provided an adequate basis for his Honour to make a finding as to the objective seriousness of the overall offending and to proceed to sentence on that basis.
	
	
	In his reasons for sentence his Honour expressly noted that the further refinement of the files according to COPINE categories relative to each count was not in evidence. He said:
	


[30]    I have information about how many images were transmitted in respect of each offence. However, I do not appear to have information about the range of categories over which those images are spread so far as each individual offence is concerned. I regard all of those offences – comprising counts 1 to 15 – as falling within the middle range for crimes of that kind. However, the sentences should vary because in some instances the number of images sent was quite low. They range from three images sent, so far as count 15 is concerned, to 123 images sent, so far as count 5 is concerned.

[31]    I propose to structure the sentences with some slight variation reflecting the number of images which was transmitted. I regard for all of the offences, except count 1, an appropriate range as being one of five to six years imprisonment.


	
	The applicant submitted that without evidence identifying the content of the files transmitted, the only available finding was that the offending (whether constituted by the individual counts or the offending overall) was at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness and not offending in the mid range, and that the sentences imposed on each count were excessive for that reason.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the mere fact that the parties could have taken a different approach to the evidence in the sentencing hearing to better address the question of the objective seriousness of the offending (both of the individual counts and the counts relative to each other), and even if it might be said his Honour could have invited that approach to better inform his sentencing discretion (in particular to assist in setting a penalty range within which the graduated sentences for the transmission offences might be imposed), the approach adopted by his Honour has not been shown to be productive of error for that reason.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that the graduated sentences, referable to the gross number of child pornography files transmitted and other features of that offending to which his Honour referred, including the fact that the conduct was not isolated, allowed for a finding that each offence was within the mid range, and that the graduated sentences for counts 2 to 14 of between 5 years and 3 months and 6 years and 3 months, against a statutory maximum of 15 years, were commensurate with that finding.
	
	
	While it was not for his Honour to require the Crown to tender evidence to enable him to differentiate between the transmission counts, not simply by the number of files transmitted but also their content, it is difficult to see how a finding of mid range offending for each of the transmission counts could be made without that evidence. It did not necessarily follow, however, that the individual sentences were infected with error for that reason, or that without that evidence a finding of low range offending was mandated. The question was whether the individual sentences are otherwise within range.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that they each exceeded an available range for offending against the section, even against an increased statutory maximum. Counsel relied upon what were said to be comparative sentences from first instance judges in New South Wales and other States to exemplify that submission.
	
	
	The Crown sought to distinguish the cases to which the applicant referred not only because, save for one case, the sentences incorporate a discount for a guilty plea, but also because fourteen of the fifteen transmission offences for which the applicant was sentenced were imposed against the increased maximum penalty of 15 years, while the offences dealt with in the other cases attracted lesser penalties. In addition, so far as the possession count under s 91H of the Crimes Act is concerned, the possession cases to which reference was made were similarly irrelevant for comparative purposes since the maximum in each case was 5 years and not 10 years under the Crimes Act.
	
	
	These distinguishing features limit the utility of any of the cases to which the Court was referred for comparative purposes.
	
	
	It emerged from the affidavits and submissions filed by the parties in 2014, however, that contrary to the basis on which his Honour had proceeded, evidence had been led at trial as to the nature of the images to which each of the transmission counts related.
	
	
	Annexed to the 2014 affidavit of Mr Hammond, the applicant’s solicitor, were trial exhibits R and V. Annexures C and D to that affidavit were documents prepared by Mr Miller, counsel for the applicant, breaking down the contents of the images and videos contained in those Crown exhibits and their image names and Oliver scale categories (another categorisation scale for such images). This analysis was accepted by the Crown as being correct.
	
	
	This evidence revealed that, contrary to the parties’ common position at the hearing of the appeal in 2013, there was evidence led during the trial, as to the categorisation of the child pornography the subject of each count, against the Oliver scale. That scale is:
	


Category 1 – erotic posing with no sexual activity

Category 2 – Solo masturbation or sexual activity between

Category 3 – no penetrative sexual activity between adults and children

Category 4 – penetrative sexual activity between adults and children

Category 5 – Sadism and bestiality


	
	The categorisation of the images relevant to each of the transmission counts and the sentence which his Honour imposed for each of those offences was:

	In the further submissions filed for the applicant in 2014, it was submitted that this evidence established that his Honour had erred in concluding that each of his transmission offences fell within the mid range. He also argued that counts 1-4, 6-11 and 14 each fell below the mid range of seriousness of such offences; that count 5 fell slightly below or within the mid range; that counts 12 and 13 fell towards the bottom end of the range of seriousness of such offences; and that count 15 at the lower end of objective seriousness.
	
	
	That was not conceded by the Crown, which submitted that this evidence established that his Honour’s finding that each of these offences fell within the mid range of such offending, was open. In the case of counts 14 and 15, committed towards the end of the applicant’s period of offending, it was submitted that while the number of images transmitted were small, they fell in category 4 (penetrative sexual activity between adults and children) and this also justified a finding of mid range offending.
	
	
	The applicant accepted that a sentence of imprisonment had to be imposed upon him for his offending. He urged the conclusion, however, that neither counts 1 nor count 12 could be categorised as mid range offences, given the number and nature of the images to which those counts related. It was also argued that a sentence in relation to count 5 could incorporate the criminality involved in all of the transmission offences; so that all of the sentences for those offences could be made wholly or largely concurrent with the sentence imposed for count 5. It was conceded that there had to be some accumulation of sentences for the possession charge, but it was argued that that the images for which the applicant was being sentenced in relation to that count were also the subject of the transmission offences.
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions in relation to counts 1 and 12 must be accepted. Count 1, which related to the transmission of 6 images falling into category 1, attracted a head sentence of 3 years and 8 months and count 12, which related to the transmission of 5 category 1 images, attracted a head sentence of 5 years and 6 months. Neither was a mid range offence and neither warranted the sentence imposed, notwithstanding that they were committed as part of a course of conduct, a matter which had to be taken into account in considering the nature and seriousness of each offence.
	
	
	The errors in relation to these two counts, plainly arose from his Honour’s failure to refer to the trial exhibits which dealt with these matters. As we have already noted, he was not assisted by the parties in this regard.
	
	
	Even when those errors are considered together with the Crown’s concession in relation to count 3, it does not necessarily follow that the applicant should be re-sentenced. Consideration must also be given to the total sentence imposed on the applicant as the result of his Honour’s approach to the principle of totality. That approach was very favourable to the applicant, there being an accumulation of only one month of the sentence imposed for each of the transmission offences, irrespective of the length of the individual sentences, or their seriousness.
	
	
	In the result, an overall sentence and non-parole period was imposed which was not excessive, indeed it might even be described as lenient, given the overall criminality involved in the applicant’s offending and the maximum penalties provided for. In the result, despite the errors identified, this sentence should not be interfered with on appeal.
	
	
	In applying the totality principle his Honour had to reduce the prima facie length of the head sentences in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the applicant’s criminality and the totality of the sentences imposed (see Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 308.). The result of that exercise must not, however, give any suggestion that there had been some kind of discount for the applicant’s multiple offending (see R v Knight [2005] NSWCCA 253; 155 A Crim R 252 at [112] and R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at [18]).
	
	
	In a complex sentencing exercise such as this, as discussed in Ranguihuna v R [2015] NSWCCA 48 at [50]-[52] by reference to the discussion in McCarthy v R [2011] NSWCCA 64 at [76]-[79], while the sentences for distinct offences must be taken into account as having played a part in the determination of the overall sentence, the structure of the sentences imposed and the resulting overall sentence, must be considered in light of the total criminality involved in the offending for which an offender is being sentenced.
	
	
	Here, as well as the 3 counts in respect of which error has been established, the overall sentence encompasses 12 other offences correctly identified to fall into the mid range. Count 5 related to 123 images, 21 of which fell in category 3, 47 in category 4 and 1 in category 5. It was the most serious of the transmission offences. The conclusion that it was a mid range offence, was, on that evidence, favourable to the applicant. The conclusion that it was more serious, was open.
	
	
	That evidence also establishes that the sentences imposed for the other transmission offences could not have been made concurrent with that imposed for count 5. Concurrent sentences may not be imposed simply because of the similarity of the conduct the subject of the separate counts, or because they are part of the one course of criminal conduct. Sentences should only be totally concurrent if the sentence for one offence, encompasses the criminality of all the offences (see R v Jarrold [2010] NSWCCA 69 per Howie J at [56], cited with approval in Franklin v R [2013] NSWCCA 122 at [44] and MPB v R [2013] NSWCCA 213 at [134]). Given the nature and seriousness of the other offences, an order for concurrency was not open to the sentencing judge.
	
	
	To give but one example, count 8 attracted a head sentence of 5 years and 9 months. It involved 17 images and 6 videos, 10 and 5 of which, respectively, fell into category 4. The objective seriousness of that offending was incapable of being encompassed by the sentence for count 5, given the number and nature of the videos and images comprehended in these two different offences. No different conclusion is available in relation to the other counts, particularly given the course of conduct in which the applicant engaged in committing all offences.
	
	
	His Honour’s approach to accumulation resulted in an overall sentence which, if it were to be reduced because of the errors identified, would result in an erroneously lenient sentence for the totality of the applicant’s serious offending.
	
	
	In the result, it must be concluded that no lesser total sentence is warranted in law (see Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 at [43]).
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, we would order that leave to appeal be allowed, but the appeal be dismissed.

		15 May 2015",2015-05-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2424946,R v SCHIPANSKI [2015] NSWDC 381,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Christopher Harold Schipanski pleaded guilty on an indictment, having been committed for sentence, in respect of four offences, one a Commonwealth crime, the other three offences contrary to the New South Wales Crimes Act.
	
	
	The Commonwealth offence alleged that he between 1 January 2011 and about 12 December 2013 at Broken Hill in the State of New South Wales did use a carriage service to access child pornography material. This is an offence contrary to subs 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. I am informed by the Crown in its written submissions it carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	In relation to the three State offences they are all offences contrary to s 91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 NSW, and each offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Each offence was committed on 12 December 2013 and relates to the possession of child abuse material stored in particular places hence the different charges.
	
	
	Count 2 on the indictment alleged the prisoner’s possession of child abuse material on what is described as a Lexar USB flash drive.
	
	
	The third count in the indictment alleges the accused’s possession of child abuse material on a black Thermaltake PC tower.
	
	
	The fourth count in the indictment alleges possession of child abuse material on fourteen CD/DVD’s.
	
	
	The essential facts of the matter are that by the use of a carriage service over a period of time of almost three years, at least, the prisoner used a carriage service to access child pornography which he downloaded and stored in relevant repositories reflected, as I understand it, from the facts in counts 2, 3 and 4.
	
	
	The crimes are closely related to one another obviously and there must be a substantial degree of concurrence. But in my view, having regard to the evidence of the prisoner, and what is self-evidently the case from the facts, that the prisoner was able to pick and choose what he would retain for future reference. The prisoner accessed the child pornographic material beyond that which is specifically stored in the three repositories. Thus, the totality of the criminality in relation to the matter is enhanced by the four charges together rather than if, for example, count 1 had stood alone, or counts 2, 3 and 4 had stood alone.
	
	
	The statement of facts is very detailed. I do not propose to go through it all and relate every detail. But particular essential details perhaps need to be included within the judgment. There is annexed to the judgment, as annexure A, a description of various materials that were found in various disks and DVD’s found by police, as I understand it, in their investigation of this matter, the subject of particularly count 4 in the indictment, with a summary of the material contained therein.
	
	
	I also was required - reluctantly but obviously importantly - to view some of the images which were accessed by the prisoner by use of the carriage service, and then particularly downloaded.
	
	
	The background to the offending in the facts states that peer to peer file sharing is the distribution and sharing of digital media using peer to peer (P2P) networking technology over the Internet. This file sharing allows users to access media files such as pictures, videos, music and other files using a P2P software programme that searches for other connected computers on a P2P network to locate the desired content. The users of such networks are end user computer systems that are connected via the Internet.
	
	
	In 2011 investigators from the Northern Territory Police Online Child Exploitation Investigation Unit identified what is described as an Internet protocol (IP) address being used by a subscriber who had child exploitation material in the shared folder of a P2P programme. This subscriber was identified as the prisoner.
	
	
	Why further action was not taken at that point of time I do not know. However the facts as they reveal it show that the prisoner - as the particulars of count 1 identify - continued to offend in terms of court 1. Whilst in 2012 investigators from a similar investigation unit of South Australia Police identified five IP addresses used by a subscriber who had child exploitation material in a shared folder, and again this offender was identified.
	
	
	Again, for reasons that are not explained over a year later on 12 December 2013, police executed a Commonwealth Crimes search warrant on the prisoner’s address in Broken Hill. The first thing the prisoner is recorded as saying, when asked if he wanted to declare anything, was “I’m going to gaol, aren’t I?” I have already answered that question for him today but I am sure that he knew from the moment he was arrested, given the character of this offending, which is serious offending indeed, that inevitably he would go to gaol.
	
	
	When police entered the house they located a computer operating in the dining room, and the screen had numerous files, the names of those files indicating that they contained child abuse material. The computer was shut down and seized. Numerous other hard drives, cameras, USB drives, and CD’s and DVD’s were seized.
	
	
	In relation to count 4 many of the CD’s and DVD’s had particular words written on them describing what was contained in the disks. “Piccys”, “Good Piccys”, “Favourites”, and “Nude pictures” were written on these disks. The prisoner indicated the disks contained child abuse material. A number of times during the search the prisoner became emotional and said, “Just put me in gaol”, and also “I don’t want to go to gaol”.
	
	
	Child pornography under State law is material identified by police as child abuse material. In relation to child abuse material and/or child pornography there is a scale called the CETS scale. The acronym relates to Child Exploitation Tracking System. This scale developed in conjunction, I would understand, through national protocols, identifies what I understand to be six levels of such material.
	
	
	The first level is sexually suggestive posing with no sexual activity - and I pause to say, as the facts will reveal, a great deal of the material the prisoner had was of that character.
	
	
	The second category is non-penetrative sexual activity between children or solo masturbation by a child.
	
	
	The third category is non-penetrative sexual activity between adults and children, or an adult and a child.
	
	
	The fourth category is penetrative sexual activity between children, or adults and children.
	
	
	The fifth category is sadism, humiliation or bestiality.
	
	
	The sixth category is animated, or virtual depictions of children engaged in sexual poses or activity.
	
	
	As one can see, the scale moves up in number the seriousness of the character of the images increases.
	
	
	It goes without saying that anybody with any common sense whatsoever would know that, whether it be category on or the worst - as I see it - category of images, what one would be watching would be images of a child who had been exploited in various ways. It would be self-evident to anyone watching any particular image, whether it be a posed picture or a video, that the exploitation of that child would not necessarily be fully represented by the image and the surrounding circumstances in which that child had been brought to the image would be, on occasions, circumstances of coercion and other improper conduct towards the child.
	
	
	The items specifically retrieved from the prisoner’s property were items described in counts 2, 3 and 4 as I have outlined them, the flash drive, the PC tower, and the fourteen CD’s and/or DVD’s.
	
	
	In dealing with count 1 the essence of that charge, the Commonwealth charge, is that the accused by using a particular P2P programme, described as ‘eMule’, downloaded material to the relevant tower, USB stick or drive, and CD and DVD’s.
	
	
	The prisoner during the course of an interview admitted to using the P2P programme eMule daily over the past three to four years to download child pornography. To be fair to the prisoner, in giving evidence he shed - to my mind - more light upon the matter than was revealed in the interviews with the police. It is quite clear, on his own version, that practically on a daily basis he was, with the use of a carriage service, accessing child pornography, viewing images, and picking and choosing what material he would download.
	
	
	Sometimes of course, as he explained it, he would download material en masse which would not necessarily require him to look at every image, he could come back to those images if he had the time at a later time. The facts show the particular files that he created in the PC tower or, as I understand it, the hard drive of the personal computer he had.
	
	
	With regard to counts 2, 3 and 4 the Crown has categorized by reference to the CETS category what the prisoner downloaded. So far as the USB drive or stick is concerned he downloaded sixty-nine videos that fit into the category one of the scale. He downloaded six videos related to category two. A total of seventy-five videos.
	
	
	As far as I am aware - I was not shown any videos, for that I am grateful - I would understand it that the videos would be consistent with the still images that I primarily saw in the sealed material.
	
	
	The facts set out in relation to the category two material, the conduct of persons shown in the video are consistent with that category of this child abuse material. One video, for example, had two young girls naked together. One video had a young girl of approximately eight years of age naked, undertaking particular activities, and another video had two pre-teen children naked involved in particular activities.
	
	
	With regard to the category one material the ages of the children shown in some of the videos - three particularly identified in the facts are meant to be representative - is estimated to be eight years of age.
	
	
	With regard to count 3 the PC contained a total of 47,224 images and 8,017 video files. A random sample of 6,688 images were viewed, and 325 of those images were classified as child abuse material - that is about 4.86%. It is estimated, as I understand it, on an extrapolation from this cross-sampling, that the total number of images classified as child exploitation material on the hard drive is between 19,098 and 25,090.
	
	
	A random sample of 223 videos was viewed and 61 of these videos were classified as child abuse material, that is 27.35%. It is estimated on this sampling that the total number of videos classified as child exploitation material on the PC is between 1,593 and 2,791.
	
	
	In relation to the images that have been identified through random sample, 324 of the images were category one, one was category two.
	
	
	Fifty-four of the videos were category one, five were category two. There were two videos that were category four, and of course category four is penetrative sexual activity between children, or adults and children. The words speak for themselves.
	
	
	I have some description of the category two image. The category one images were basically photographs of nude, or semi-naked girls, pre-pubescent, as I understand it, largely in states of undress in sexually suggestive poses.
	
	
	I also have details of the various categories of video. One video showed an adult male having penile/vaginal penetrative sex with a girl aged four or five, and the male forces the child to perform fellatio upon him. One image shows two young girls masturbating themselves, and other activities consistent with the category four classification. The category two matters involve young girls, pre-teen and the like. The category one material shows nude children aged from two to sixteen in various positions.
	
	
	Count 4, the CD’s and DVD’s, I have already referred to, and I have referred to the annexure, and I will not go through the detail of that. An estimate of the number of images at what is level one of the CETS scale exceeds 11,000 images. It is thought in relation to the CD and the DVD’s they are practically all level one images.
	
	
	The prisoner participated in an electronic interview on 7 February 2014 which quite clearly, by reference to his evidence before me, was not entirely frank. He made admissions of possession of the material, made admissions about downloading the material, and made admissions describing some of the material that was either already seen by the investigators, or subsequently to be seen by them.
	
	
	He said, and it is probably true because he had done so so many times, he did not have a 'clue' how many times he accessed child pornography on his computer. He gave explanations as to how he accessed it, how he copied it, and how he downloaded it, and how he described the relevant pictures.
	
	
	At one stage he said that some of the young girls were “beautiful, and I wish they were my daughter”. But he could not understand why he said that. He expressed regret for his conduct and claimed that he realised his mistake. I pause to point out that whilst I acknowledge that expression of regret, one would have great difficulty believing that he realised his mistake only because he had been arrested by the police. He had ample opportunity over the three years before, or at least the two years and 11 months particularised in count one, to realise the error of his ways.
	
	
	He claimed that he got no sexual satisfaction out of the images. With respect to him, a claim by him that not only is it ostensibly untrue but in my view is contradicted by the evidence he gave before this court. He went so far as to deny that he liked to look at young nude girls, which is a completely unacceptable explanation by him. It scarcely explains why he went on a daily basis to access such material, view it and store it. But he did acknowledge that he realised that what he was doing was wrong. He also, I hasten to say as his evidence revealed here and as he said in the interview, downloaded a body of adult pornography. In fact, as I understood his oral evidence although I do not have particulars of this, he had far more adult pornography, which as I gather within reason is legal - than he did child pornography.
	
	
	He did deny however sharing the images with other people. There is no suggestion in the facts available to me of commercial exploitation or creation of child abuse material by him. He explained that in fact he thought that he was “ripping off the paedophiles” who he would have understood had created this material. If he did not understand the sordid circumstances in which this imagery would have been obtained. He ought to have had that understanding. I have great difficulty accepting or understanding that he did not understand the sordid and darker context of child abuse material. There can be no suggestion whatsoever that child abuse material or child pornography is in some way some form of victimless crime. Every image shows a victim and the circumstances in which children are placed in that position one can imagine defy description. Simply the idea of a five year old child being penetrated in the vagina by an adult male speaks of the horror of that material.
	
	
	The offender had no criminal history at the time of the commission of these offences and I take that into account. He is a mature man, 56 years of age. Although the images, the subject of this charge, were retrieved by the execution of the search warrant on 12 December 2013, and although the police had ample information just from their observation of the offender’s living quarters, the operation of the computer, he was in possession of the relevant material, he was not interviewed until 7 February 2014, at which time he was arrested and apparently was released without bail. He later was placed on conditional bail. He has spent no time in custody.
	
	
	In relation to the assessment of the offending with which I am concerned in the submissions of the learned Crown Prosecutor, which have been most helpful, and the oral and professional written submissions, which were produced at the heel of the hunt on behalf of the accused, reference is made to a number of authorities which deal with the issue of categorising the offending with which I am concerned.
	
	
	One such case is R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370, a decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in which Johnson J, in his usual thorough, succinct and insightful way, sought to identify the character of offences of this type and matters that may be taken into account in considering aggravating circumstances expressed in the general sense. In relation to the matter of Gent the two matters that are relevant arising from the criteria, if I might call them that, identified by his Honour are, firstly, the nature and content of the images including the age of the children and, secondly, the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed. No child abuse material of course, I hasten to say, is acceptable. But the characterisations that are nationally recognised identify various levels of activity which might reflect upon the seriousness of the offending, and, as has been pointed out from the facts, the vast majority of the images are level one images.
	
	
	The second matter identified arising out of Gent relevant in this matter is the number of images or items of material possessed by the offender. Although his Honour said in the case of the possession of material for personal use as a relevant matter, the significance of the quantity lies more in the number of different children who are depicted and thereby victimised. The facts available to me are not entirely clear as to the number of children. From my observation of the limited images that I was shown there were in fact images of many different children shown in that material. Frankly, when I had the displeasure to look at that material, I was not particularly astute about that matter before I sealed the envelope containing the material. I certainly have not had a great deal of information from the facts. But I would understand that this is not a case of thousands of images of one child, there are many many children involved.
	
	
	The Crown states, quite properly, that the offences are objectively serious and it says what is pertinent, in the context of considering the totality of the criminality particularly by reference to count one, that the offender accessed and subsequently processed over 13,000 child pornography images and over 2,000 videos. The ages of the children depicted in the images and videos range from about two years to 16 years. A number of different children were depicted and thereby victimised. A very substantial number indeed and the categories are as I have earlier identified.
	
	
	One other feature of the matter that the Crown did not refer to in that part of its written submissions (at para 25) is the fact that the images that were stored in the offender’s flash drive, hard drive and in the disks and DVDs that had been obtained, not on one day or two days but over an extensive period of time. Over the three years that the offender had been accessing the internet, on his own admission almost daily, viewing images and determining which images he would use for his own purpose.
	
	
	In the written submissions of the offender it is acknowledged the seriousness of the offending. That goes without saying. I really cannot do justice to it really by a mere summation of the facts. It is acknowledged, as the Crown submits, that general deterrence is a paramount consideration in these types of offences citing the decision of Gent to which I referred.
	
	
	The defence refers to a decision of Minehan v R ((2010) 201 A Crim R 243) where Hulme J, like Johnson J, a very learned judge in the area of sentencing and other aspects of the criminal law, has taken upon himself to identify what he states, and which I accept, are relevant matters to be taken into account in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending relating to the possession and/or dissemination or transmission of child pornography. Although, as I say, the offender is not responsible for dissemination or transmission which would either warrant other charges or, alternatively, aggravate the seriousness of the offending with which I am concerned. He points to these features which arise in this matter. Actual children were used in the creation of the material. He refers to the nature and content of the material including the age of the children, the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed. I have already dealt with that matter. He refers to the extent of any cruelty or physical harm occasioned to the children that may be discernible from the material. I would imagine in the case of penile penetration of the vagina of a five year old there would be, one would expect, pain or physical harm to the child. However, I am not aware of any ‘gratuitous’ cruelty per se shown in the images. Of course, as to what cruelty had been inflicted upon the children getting to and from the place of the images is a matter of complete speculation. But the Crown does not submit that there are images depicting cruelty. I accept from what I understand of the facts, images or videos that might infer at least physical harm or show physical harm are fairly to be said to be limited. Sexual penetration in these circumstances is clearly a form of cruelty.
	
	
	Here, the main features are: there is the number of images of the material and the number of children as discussed in Gent, there is possession without dissemination, which is a relevant matter to take into account and, of course, there are matters such as the proximity of the offender’s activities to those responsible for bringing the material into existence. This offender is not said to be closely linked to the creators of this disgusting material. The degree of planning or organisation or sophistication in this matter was not great. It really required essential computer skills which I am sure are not uncommon throughout the community. The offender acted alone. He was not involved in what I would call a collaborative network of like-minded persons as arises in the facts of some of the cases to which I was referred. There was no suggestion of the material being seen or acquired by vulnerable persons, particularly children. There is no suggestion the offender’s computer was one to which children had access to, nor was there any risk of the material being seen or acquired by persons susceptible to act in the manner described or depicted.
	
	
	Of course I am required to take into account relevant matters too under s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as well as s 16A Commonwealth Crimes Act, to which provisions I will refer shortly.
	
	
	In this matter I have a pre-sentence report setting out the background of the offender. Much of the material in the report was reflected in the evidence of the offender. Again, perhaps in a qualified way, I say “in fairness” to the offender, I believe he was more frank in his evidence before this court than he was to the Community Corrections Service and to the psychologist who assessed him.
	
	
	The offender lives alone in Broken Hill and he lives next door to a brother for whom the offender is a carer. I understand the brother has significant health issues, the precise detail of which was not made known to me, although I have a general understanding of his condition. His brother was in fact at court during the earlier sentencing proceedings. It was not submitted on behalf of the offender that there were exceptional circumstances arising out of the relationship of the offender with his brother to be taken into account, but the fact that the offender is a carer for his brother is a matter to be taken into account as one of a number of factors. There has been an AVO taken out against him from an ex-girlfriend concerning some activity of the offender. But I draw no conclusion adverse to the offender in relation to that matter.
	
	
	He has been married and lived with his wife for 13 years and has two children. However, that marriage broke down and the circumstances I do not propose to divulge upon in public, it is not a matter of significance other than the fact that the offender does have contact with his son, but no contact with his daughter for many years.
	
	
	He attended high school in Broken Hill I am informed and received an education to Year Ten. He has got a moderate level of numeracy and literacy skills. He obviously has considerable computer skills. He receives a carer’s pension. Occasionally he does part-time casual work. He did work for a period of time as a storeman for a local mining company.
	
	
	He claimed to the Community Corrections Service that he suffered from depression and anxiety and had been seeing a counsellor for these issues prior to his arrest in relation to the current matters. The counsellor confirmed he had attended 18 sessions with her for problems relating to post traumatic stress disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and prolonged grief disorder. He grieves for his mother who died over three years ago and they had a very close relationship. He also suffers stress from seeing his grandmother being killed in a motor vehicle accident when he was four and the accidental death of his father in a workplace accident in 1983. He also is very stressed in relation to the current court proceedings as one would expect.
	
	
	To the Community Corrections Service he claimed that he only began looking at the child pornography out of interest “to see what the hype is about”. He claimed to the Community Corrections Service that he was unaware that there were no many images that he had stored and could not really explain how he downloaded them. This clearly is not correct. Certainly it does not accord with the evidence he gave before me which as I said before was much more frank. He tried to downplay the seriousness of the offences with the Community Corrections Service. He seemed to show more insight in his evidence before me. Perhaps he had better opportunity to discuss with his legal representatives precisely what is the significance of the offending with which I am concerned. He said in relation to the character of the offences that he was shocked and “amazed” that he was the person described in the facts as they were alleged against him. He claims that he was not sexually attracted to children and he did not gain any sexual satisfaction from viewing the images. Claims I have a great deal of difficulty giving any credence to whatsoever.
	
	
	It was thought applying the actuarial risk needs assessment that he was a “medium risk of re-offending” and he has particular issues that are required to be addressed in any supervision, including matters relating to education, his financial circumstances, the profitable use of his recreation and leisure time and addressing personal and emotional matters.
	
	
	The Community Corrections officer assessed the offender as having a problematic upbringing and a very fractured history of personal relationships but having no insight into the seriousness of the offences and endeavouring to minimise his behaviour, showing no empathy for the victims of these offences, portraying himself as a victim and claiming fears for his personal safety. He would require supervision of Community Corrections which would involve psychological treatment and other matters consistent with his needs.
	
	
	A psychologist with the Department of Corrective Services prepared a report dealing with the facts of the matter as alleged against the offender and reporting upon the offender’s claimed lack of sexual interest in the images. A risk assessment was undertaken in accordance with criteria that identified both static and dynamic risk factors. The dynamic factors relevant to him include consideration of the research that suggests that online pornography offenders have the same major risk factors associated with re-offending as offenders who commit ‘offline’ sexual offences. In other words, people who view images online have the same risk factors as people who go out and indecently assault and rape and otherwise sexually interfere with children and other people. The risk factors are sexual and general self-regulation, sexual deviance, offence supportive attitudes and beliefs, antisocial orientation and intimacy defects and she describes other matters that can be defined as dynamic risk factors.
	
	
	The dynamic risk factors appearing relevant for Mr Schipanski appear to be deficits in developing intimate relationships reflected in marriage breakdown and other relationship issues, the offender having had no relationships for apparently eight years before his arrest. Another risk factor for him was sexual self regulation. But in this regard it was noted he did not admit to a sexual interest in prepubescent girls and denied being aroused by the images. A claim, as I say, I have difficulty accepting.
	
	
	In summary, it was thought that he had a low rate of re-offending, accepting what he had said of course. There were factors self evidently missing from his background that might otherwise increase the risk of him re-offending, such as prior criminal history including violence, prior criminal history of contact sexual offences amongst other matters. It was thought that, bearing in mind there were no drug or alcohol issues, he still would need assistance in relation to treatment for anxiety and depression although that would appear to be appropriately managed, he would benefit from continuing psychological assessment, counselling and monitoring but sex offender treatment would not be available in the community, particularly in the Broken Hill area. It was unlikely that he would receive any sexual offender treatment whilst in custody.
	
	
	The prisoner as I have said gave evidence before me and I have cited some aspects of his evidence as they relate to the material that has already been tendered. He said amongst other things that he felt terrible about what he had done and was glad that he had been arrested. He said he made no attempt to hide the material. He reflected upon what he had said in his interview about wishing some of the girls had been his daughter. He gave an explanation for that comment which I found difficult to understand let alone accept. I believe it was an off the cuff remark which did reflect his great, at least personal and emotional interest in the images that he had at least if not sexual.
	
	
	He claimed that he felt terrible and remorseful over the period of time that he was downloading images and as I said, he did agree as he had not agreed before that it wasn’t entirely accurate that he had no sexual interest in the images. He claimed he had an interest at one stage but did not like it but he could not explain to this Court as he could not explain to anybody else why he kept downloading the images. There is some material that he did not perform particular acts to reflect his sexual gratification and I have no evidence to contradict that assertion.
	
	
	He claimed remorse and he also claimed that he did not realise how much material he had. Another assertion I completely reject having regard to the number of disks that he had and the number of images on the disk. He agreed as I said earlier to, for at least 18 months on a daily basis accessing images, looking at images for at least half an hour a day but not always viewing all the images that he had downloaded. Some images were automatically downloaded. He reiterated the assertion that he felt good to rip off the “paedophiles”.
	
	
	He said that whilst he liked looking at the images, there were aspects of the matter that he was ignorant of and claimed that really in effect that the downloading of the images was essentially compulsive conduct on his part to use my words and he was forced to admit in cross-examination that it is self evident that there were images he must have liked because of the manner in which he had downloaded them and categorised them, as is the case in relation to count 4.
	
	
	The last piece of evidence that I need cite out of the material that has been presented to the Court is the psychological report by Jane Farrin which is a very detailed report that runs to 21 pages. The report is very thorough like the psychological report, which is much shorter, prepared by the Department of Corrective Services. One of the problems with this report and its findings is reliance upon, or at least consideration of, the representations made by the prisoner about his lack of sexual interest in the images which I have already commented upon. It reflects upon his history which provides much greater detail than I have referred to in this judgment. My summary of his background is merely that, a summary, and I am prepared to accept the much greater detail of his interests, his employment and other personal matters, including his financial history, appears in the report of the psychologist, Ms Farrin.
	
	
	He gives a history of depression in his family, his mother particularly. His mother passed away in 2011 of pulmonary oedema. I am not given the date of her death day but if she died in 2011. It would seem, based on the particulars in relation to count 1, he had already started downloading this material before his mother’s death. I do not accept for one moment that the downloading of material is a reaction to his mother’s death. Although I accept the general proposition, as it is self-evident from all the material, that the prisoner was a relatively socially isolated person that made him vulnerable to making access to internet material of this type.
	
	
	There is reference in the report to a history of mental health treatment. In 1995 he was dealt with by Dr Philip Kneebone in August 1995 for depression, suicidal ideation and active intent and “neurovegetative symptoms of depression”. He was actually admitted to Broken Hill Hospital on 3 October 1995 by police who found him wandering aimlessly along a road after living in the bush for a number of days. He had visual hallucinations and other persecutory beliefs and he was admitted for two weeks. He was readmitted on 9 January 1996 to hospital for eight weeks showing various symptoms consistent with a significant mental illness including paranoid thoughts and other matters. He was admitted to hospital again for mood stabilisation. He then on that occasion went to live with his mother and brother being too scared to live alone.
	
	
	In the course of committing count 1, he was reviewed by a visiting psychiatrist at Broken Hill Mental Health Service on 7 October 2011 reporting occasional suicidal thoughts, vivid dreams, hallucinations, hearing the voice of his mother upon falling asleep and having various sleep disorders. He was said to display symptoms consistent with a “schizotypical personal trait”.
	
	
	He was reviewed again by Dr Kneebone, who was then a visiting psychiatrist, on 23 January 2014. He had not seen Dr Kneebone for 15 years. He was presenting, after being arrested by the police but not then charged, with vivid dreams, auditory hallucinations, sleep disturbance, low mood, suicidal ideation, anxiety disorder and surprisingly “low libido”. He was given anti-depressant medication and he gave a history which I will not go into in detail of the effect upon him of his mother’s death and the effect upon his mental state in the manner that I have generally described.
	
	
	He has been seeing a mental health social worker in 2013 and 2014 and throughout 2014 to 2015 and he said that he was seeking some counselling in relation to dealing with other people who he thought took advantage of him. He is currently prescribed Zoloft on a daily basis and I would recommend that the custodial authorities ensure that he is provided with relevant medication when he is in custody. He is not prescribed any anti-psychotic medication. He continues to have some regular suicidal ideation but no active intent and many symptoms of anxiety.
	
	
	I do not propose to go through his psycho sexual development. I have noted what is said in the report. I note again his claim that he was not sexually aroused or sexually attracted to the images. He denied any particular activity in relation to the images.
	
	
	On the basis of the information provided by the prisoner, in conjunction with some objective facts, the psychologist was of the view that despite poor cognitive problem solving as a risk factor, but in the circumstance of having no deviant sexual interests or activities and having had three significant relationships, he was not thought to be at high risk of reoffending. He also did not report attitude supportive of adult sexual offending or behaviours consistent with using sex as a coping strategy. Thus the risk factors identified are very few.
	
	
	Ultimately the conclusion of the psychologist is that in the context of social isolation and the impact upon him of mental illness in the past, relationship breakdown and the like, but in the absence of a history of sexual deviancy or substance and alcohol abuse, the prisoner was a man of average to below average intelligence with diagnostic criteria for ‘Schizoaffective Disorder’ characterised by paranoid thoughts, delusions, hallucinations, depression, suicide ideation and sometimes poor personal hygiene, sleep disturbance, appetite changes and social isolation. He has had a history of over 20 years of auditory and visual hallucinations, and he possesses few of the traditional static and dynamic criminogenic risk factors of general reoffending which have been identified as predisposing an individual towards offending behaviour. He has no prior criminal history amongst other matters.
	
	
	His risk factors for sexual reoffending include deficits in his problem solving, his negative affect and loneliness, and he is a person who would require treatment both in custody and at large, particularly addressing matters relating to problem solving skills, addressing his social isolation, and getting him to understand his sexual offending. She noted that whilst the offending was very serious, he was vulnerable and socially isolated. She said he expressed significant remorse and distress regarding his offending, and was extremely fearful of incarceration and was embarrassed about talking of his offending behaviour, knowing it was morally wrong. Imprisonment imposes a significant deterrent to him. She believed that he was not a person who could be categorised as a paedophile, not satisfying the diagnostic criteria for paedophilia. She sets out at pp 19, 20 and 21 a summary of these various matters at paras 1 to 12, and recommendations relating to treatment in the community set out at paras 1 to 4 which no doubt will be available for the Parole Authority to consider.
	
	
	Naturally, as is self-evident from the attention I have taken to the matters raised in the evidence, I have had regard to all the evidence. As I said, I was assisted by detailed written submissions by the Crown and the defence. It is clear in relation to the Commonwealth matter I am required to have regard to the terms of s 16A Commonwealth Crimes Act, and in relation to the State offences I am required to have regard to the relevant provisions dealing with consideration of the factors in sentencing in various sections of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	With regard to that latter Act, if I might deal with that first. I am required to have regard to the ‘Purposes of Sentencing’ in s 3A. Clearly each of the matters identified as purposes of sentencing are relevant, particularly general and personal deterrence, denouncing the conduct of the prisoner, ensuring adequate punishment, making him accountable, but also promoting his rehabilitation in the context of sentencing a man to a term of imprisonment for the first time at his age. I point out that, as all the cases that I have been referred to and the cases I have dealt with show, it is not unusual for a person with no prior criminal convictions to be guilty of crimes such as those disclosed in the counts and this indictment. Many of those individuals having similar profiles to this prisoner are socially isolated people, but on the other hand people who should know better.
	
	
	With regard to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I am also required to have regard to s 5, and clearly no sentence other than a term of imprisonment should be imposed. I am required to have regard to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, not only those matters of aggravation and mitigation that might be inferred from the operation of subs (1) but also those matters arising under s 21A(2) as aggravating factors, and (3) as mitigating factors in respect of the State offences.
	
	
	In respect of particular aggravating factors, the subsection does not speak of any particular matter that I could identify which has not already been commented upon by reference to the facts. Of course, it might be said that the State offences involve multiple victims or a series of criminal acts in this limited sense, that he had access to images which showed multiple people being exploited in the way that the photographs - and clearly somewhere in the world, many of these images no doubt coming from overseas, there were criminal acts being committed by others upon children that the prisoner by mere possession of the offending material must have condoned. To have an interest in this material in my view is to condone what is shown in the images, and to assert otherwise with respect scarcely rates acceptance.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors, there are a number. Whilst I have not found as an aggravating factor the offences were quite ‘planned or organised ‘criminal activity, I could not conclude on balance favourable to the prisoner that they were not “planned” activities, but they certainly were not part of organised criminal activity, at least on the part of the prisoner. I acknowledge of course that organised crime is very active in the exploitation of human beings around the globe, particularly children. This should have been understood by the prisoner, but the prisoner is not responsible for those organisations.
	
	
	The prisoner did not have any record of previous convictions. I am prepared to accept that before the prisoner commenced this course of conduct reflected in count 1 he was a person of good character. I cannot conclude however he is unlikely to reoffend. I have to say in relation to that aspect and his prospects of rehabilitation, although I note the views of the psychologist that he is of low risk of reoffending, he certainly needs a great deal of counselling and direction before one could be confident that those circumstances occurred.
	
	
	By reference to his evidence last Tuesday, I ultimately conclude that he has shown remorse, shown that he has accepted responsibility for his actions, acknowledged the harm that is caused by his conduct. But it must be fairly said this has been late coming and was only partially revealed and rather emptily revealed when he was interviewed by the police. His plea of guilty is of course a mitigating factor for which he receives a discrete discount.
	
	
	Just turning if I may to s 16A, I have dealt with the nature and circumstances of the offence. There are no other offences to be taken into account. The offence in count 1 does reflect a course of conduct encompassed within the charge but leading of course to the commission of the State offences. I am not aware of the personal circumstances of the victims in the sense of the people sadly portrayed in the various images, but it is to be fairly said it was not the prisoner who made them victims but it is the prisoner who exploited them. I cannot identify any injury, loss or damage to any individual beyond what might reasonably be inferred by the circumstances of the images. The prisoner is not personally responsible for that.
	
	
	I am required to take into account the fact that he has pleaded guilty. I am required to take into account the fact that he has co-operated with the investigating officials. I am required to take into account the deterring effect of any sentence upon him and also give full weight to general deterrence, although it is not mentioned in s 16A, but is clearly relevant in Commonwealth sentencing as was held in decisions many years ago of El Karhani and Paull and others subsequently. I have to ensure that the prisoner is adequately punished. I am required in relation to the Commonwealth matter to take into account his character, his antecedents, his age, his physical and mental condition, which I do, and his prospects of rehabilitation, which I have already commented upon. The effect upon his brother I take into account, but again it is not a matter of exceptional circumstances but still is relevant.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of his mental health, this is a very live issue in this sentencing proceeding that seemed to have received to my mind somewhat scant attention. In approaching the matter I reflect upon and specifically refer to the observations of Justice McClellan, then the Chief Judge at Common Law, now the royal commissioner into institutional child abuse in the decision of DPP v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, particularly the summary of a number of authorities he reviewed at [177]-[178]. It is to be fairly said that the mental conditions identified in great detail by the psychologist, Ms Farrin, could not be seen to be directly causally connected to the offending, but they are related, albeit indirectly, contributing as I have earlier pointed to what I see is the significant matter of his isolation, leading to the development of what he would have taken to be “relationships” through the viewing of images of people in the manner described in the facts. His Honour said that,
	


“where a person is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems, the court has developed principles to be applied when sentencing. When the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced.”


	
	The materiality in a direct sense of course is small, but in an indirect sense it does exist. The moral culpability of the prisoner however in my view is only marginally reduced by reason of that factor. It may also have the consequence, he said, that an offender is not an appropriate ‘vehicle’ for the ‘message’ of general deterrence, resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed.
	
	
	In my view, that principle, as summarised from the earlier decided authorities such as Engert and Israil, has some role to play here. But not a great role given the relationship of his mental disorders and the offending as I have analysed it. I accept however that his condition may mean that a custodial sentence will weigh more heavily upon him and be more onerous for him. In my view he may require a great deal of hospitalisation or isolation from other offenders given his mental condition. Of course, he no doubt will be isolated and will need protection because of the character of the offending. His condition is not one which in my view reduces or eliminates the significance of specific deterrence. On the other hand I do not believe his conditions, because of their indirect contribution to the offending, require greater weight to be given to specific deterrence by increasing sentence in the circumstances described by the learned Chief Judge at Common Law.
	
	
	His Honour pointed out (at [178]) that the mental health problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they be relevant to the sentencing process. Clearly here the prisoner has a serious mental illness, at least in the past, exhibiting florid symptoms at various times, but there is no evidence of florid symptomology. Perhaps underlying symptomology but certainly not pronounced symptomology as has occurred in the past at the time of the offending. This is a matter relevant both in relation to State and Federal sentencing, particularly in relation to s 16A(2)(m) Commonwealth Act.
	
	
	The Crown’s written submissions point to the need for a term of full time custody. That goes without saying. It has been the case the Crown has endeavoured to provide the Court with some assistance with some comparative sentences. I have regard to the cases that are annexed to the Crown’s written submissions so far as they provide some assistance. However, I am very mindful of what the Court of Criminal Appeal recently said in RCW (No 2) about the need to treat each case individually and not to be fixated upon one particular sentencing exercise in fixing the appropriate sentence for the matter that the Court has to determine at bar.
	
	
	I have discussed with the Crown today some of the Crown submissions in relation to the fixing of sentences and I take into account the Crown’s written submissions. The particular mater that I took issue with appears at para 25. I do not understand any provision in the Commonwealth Crimes Act that dictates that when sentencing for State and Commonwealth offences, one must accumulate the Commonwealth sentence upon the non-parole period fixed for the State offence. My understanding of these various provisions, particularly s 19, is that in fixing sentences involving State and Commonwealth matters, bearing in mind different sentencing regimes exist, that it is pertinent to ensure that there be no gap between the minimum term fixed in relation to a Commonwealth matter and the minimum term fixed in relation to a State matter, or in relation to each of the sentences imposed.
	
	
	With regard to the prospects of rehabilitation aspect, if I might just come back to that for a moment. I note what the Crown wrote in its written submissions and I generally accept what is there although the reservations about the prisoner arising from his out of court statements to psychologists and to interviewing police need to be seen in the context of his greater candour when he appeared to give evidence before me.
	
	
	With regard to the written submissions of the accused and his oral submissions, I note what was put by counsel orally and reflected in the written submissions, the weight to be given to the plea of guilty, the weight to be given to the mental health of the prisoner, the likelihood of reoffending, his prospects of rehabilitation. The difficulty I have with his prospects of rehabilitation is his lack of insight, which is reflected upon by Community Corrections and which I have observed from his statements about various matters. But it is to be fairly said that in assessing that matter one has to take into account his absence of prior sexual offending and the absence of diagnostic criteria with paedophilia. There is also the issue of his mental health which might contribute to his attitude.
	
	
	I am required to consider principles of totality, in other words I am required to sentence the offender in accordance with the majority decision of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly at [45]. It was submitted on behalf of the accused that I should look to alternatives to full time imprisonment and to that extent in part reliance is made upon some statistics that are provided.
	
	
	Unfortunately the samples provided by counsel for the accused, and I do not criticise Mr Rajalingam’s industry, but the sample of cases from JIRS statistics is pitifully small. Not for the first time in this sittings I refer to the observations of the learned Chief Justice Spigelman in 1998 in respect of inadequacy of statistics, admittedly from his perspective, when considering matters in the Court of Criminal Appeal in the decision of Bloomfield, one needs a healthy sample before one could draw any fixed conclusions and it seems to me quite clear from the authorities setting out general principles, such as Gent and Minehan, and also from some of the comparative cases, that ultimately given the period of time the offender was accessing images and the number of images and the character of the images, that notwithstanding his mental health and his absence of prior criminal convictions a term of fulltime custody ought be fixed.
	
	
	I have determined that in accordance with State legislation, pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, there should be a finding of ‘special circumstances’. The matters that might be said to be favourable to the offender in conjunction with his mental health issues and matters reflected in the report of Ms Farren requiring address by way of counselling demand an extension of the relationship of the minimum period to the balance of the sentence. I am mindful in relation to the Commonwealth sentencing the observations of the High Court in Hili and Jones where the High Court put to rest the fallacy that somehow developed that there was some sort of fixed ratio that was required to be fixed between the minimum term of a term of imprisonment, usually a non-parole period where the sentence is more than three years, and the total sentence. That fallacy which developed in part in New South Wales in cases such as Bernier and others, was based upon no legislative fiat - no disrespect to the Judges who developed those principles - but based upon essentially personal views there are a number of matters to be taken into account in fixing a minimum term; s 44 demands consideration of particular matters and it seems to me that consistent with High Court decisions such as Hili, Muldrock and the much earlier decision of Bugmy from the 1980’s (not the 2013 decision of Bugmy but the appeal from the Victorian Court of Appeal) all reflect that, in fixing a minimum term to reflect, the need for an appropriate period of supervision, which I propose to do, but not so low as to ignore the seriousness of the offending. Otherwise, I believe I have had regard to all that has been put before me.
	
	
	Mr Schipanski, could you stand up stand up please, thanks very much. I will start with the New South Wales sentences, if I may.
	
	
	In relation to count 2, 3 and 4, in respect of each offence you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment in relation to each offence which consists of a non-parole period of six months to commence on 21 May 2015 and to expire on 20 November 2015. The balance of the sentence is one year and the balance of sentence, on my calculation, will expire on 20 November 2016. In the fixing of that sentence I have given you a discount of 25% to reflect the utilitarian benefit of your plea of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment in New South Wales of Thomson and Houlton, the total sentence is one year and six months.
	
	
	For counts 2, 3 and 4 there will be total sentences of 18 months each with a non-parole period of six months, each sentence to be served concurrently. I appreciate, of course, that one might look at count 3 and having regard to the number of images conclude that that is more serious in a sense than the offence involving the hard drive or the offence involving the CDs and the DVDs, but ultimately I have concluded, notwithstanding the capacity to distinguish between one and the other to some extent, concurrent sentences of the same length are appropriate given your moral culpability particularly in relation to each offence.
	
	
	In relation to count 1 you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment pursuant to the Commonwealth Crimes Act, s 20, of two years and three months. That sentence is to commence on 21 November 2015 and to expire, on my calculation, on 20 February 2018. I direct that you be released at the expiration of nine months of your sentence upon you entering a recognisance pursuant to s 20(1)(b) yourself in the sum of $200 to be of good behaviour for a period of one year and six months from this date and appear to receive sentence if called upon to do so at any time in respect of any breach within that said period.
	
	
	A further condition of that recognisance if that you are to accept the supervision and guidance of an officer of the New South Wales Community Corrections Service for a period of one year and six months and obey all reasonable directions of that officer and that you report to the Community Corrections Service within 48 hours upon your release from custody. I do not propose at this stage to impose any other conditions of that recognisance unless so requested by the Crown.
	
	
	Mr Crown, do you seek a forfeiture order?
	
	
	WILLIAMS: Yes, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Could you assist me with the terms of that order, please.
	
	
	WILLIAMS: I have a draft order.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Could I have that, please. Any objection to the forfeiture order, Mr Walton?
	
	
	WALTON: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Schipanski, in accordance with s 23ZD of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and upon the application of the learned Director of Public Prosecutions, the following items are forfeited to the Commonwealth: one black Thermaltake computer tower with a particular serial number: one Lexar USB flash drive with a particular exhibit number on a property seizure form; and 14 CDs and DVDs with a particular exhibit number on a property seizure form. That order will be dated today, 21 May 2015.
	
	
	I’ll have that sealed and I’ll give you a copy, Mr Crown, and I’ll give you a copy, Mr Walton. Now, Mr Crown, any technical matters from you?
	
	
	WILLIAMS: No, everything is covered, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Any technical matters from you, Mr Walton?
	
	
	WALTON: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Schipanski, you are sentenced in effect to a minimum term of one year three months and you will be released, as I calculated it, to supervision, as I have ordered it, on 20 August 2016 and you will be subject to supervision by the Community Corrections Service for a period of one year six months from that date.

		09 March 2016",2015-05-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2424952,R v TEBBUTT aka KARKOE [2015] NSWDC 322,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Benjamin James Karkoe has been tried this week in the District Court at Broken Hill. He was arraigned under the name “Benjamin James Tebbutt, also known as Benjamin James Karkoe”, however the name “Tebbutt” would appear to arise out of some misunderstanding. It is clear from viewing the evidence of what occurred on the day of the search of the accused’s home, and the arrest of the accused the following day, that he made it clear that his name was “Karkoe” not “Tebbutt” and I have referred to him by that name throughout the proceedings.
	
	
	Last Tuesday he was arraigned, having made an application for a trial by Judge pursuant to s 132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, in respect of charges alleging that he, on the 1 August 2013, at Broken Hill in the State of New South Wales, did supply a prohibited drug, namely amphetamine, in an amount of 97.4 grams, being an amount more than the traffickable quantity. He entered a plea of not guilty, obviously, to that charge and the trial proceeded.
	
	
	The circumstances of the trial proceeding and the arrangements made for the accused, opportunities given to him; amongst other things to get further legal advice, to prepare for examination of witnesses, and address, are all matters of record and I need not reflect upon that aspect of the proceedings.
	
	
	In the trial a number of witnesses gave evidence all in the Crown case. Those witnesses were primarily concerned with the circumstances of the search of the accused’s home where he lived with his partner and five children, being Senior Constable Ashley Tucker, Constable Ali Chambers and Sergeant David Gallagher, who was ostensibly the officer in charge of the investigation.
	
	
	I have seen the recordings made by video recording of the circumstances of the search in the DVD or other disks which comprise Exhibits E1, E2 and E3 in the proceedings. I have available to me photographs in Exhibit D of items said to be relevant, arising from the search. Some of those items, I must say, were produced as particular exhibits. Included in those items particularly are 2 electronic scales which are Exhibit H and J. I make comment about the character of the search later on.
	
	
	Senior Constable Petersen gave evidence. He was the Custody Manager the day after the search when the accused voluntarily attended upon the Broken Hill station and was interviewed by Detective Gallagher and another Constable, I believe Senior Constable Hawkins.
	
	
	I point out from the outset, although appreciating the difficulties of a person unrepresented, that apart from some very minor matters, even in the view of the accused himself, the accused had no complaint about the way in which the police conducted themselves. Both in relation to the search and the conduct of the subsequent investigation, particularly the interview of the accused that occurred sometime after 5pm on 2 August.
	
	
	The video of the search of the accused’s premises shows suitable arrangements being made for the accused to get clothed at various times. In fact, one of the features of the matter that struck me in tribute to Sergeant Gallagher, if I may be so bold to say, was that throughout the course of the search as it is video recorded, every time some item was found that might be thought to be relevant to the investigation being undertaken, Sergeant Gallagher reiterated the caution initially given to the accused, that he need not say anything unless he wished.
	
	
	I noted, and I am not criticising Sergeant Gallagher, that in fact this was a feature of the electronic interview having evidence of the fact that the accused had been given his ‘Part 9 rights’ and appropriately processed by the custody manager and the fact that the accused at the commencement of the electronic interview was cautioned properly by Sergeant Gallagher and every time some fresh issue, or matter for comment by the accused, was raised a fresh caution was given.
	
	
	Again, as I said, I appreciate that I must be careful in assessing the accused from his conduct at the bar table in circumstances that might be strange to him. But he gave every indication to me in his spoken words and his attitude to various matters that he accepted the accuracy of the evidence of the police and accepted the propriety of the conduct and the courtesy with which he was treated by the police. This is a matter for which the police should be commended.
	
	
	I return however to the legal principles to be applied. I will refer to some core principles and then I will deal with some collateral principles, as the case unfolds, in my summation of it.
	
	
	This is a trial by Judge alone in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. A ‘trial by Judge’, as it is described in the relevant provisions, requires the Judge not just to state the principles of law which are to be applied, and the findings of fact that are made (see s 133(2) of the Act), but also requires the Judge to expose what is described as the “reasoning process,” justifying findings of fact and ultimately the verdict to be returned.
	
	
	All principles of law which are relevant and required to be applied should be identified in the judgment, including any necessary warnings that the trial Judge is required to apply in the assessment of the evidence. Where particular warnings are applied a Judge must state, where appropriate, what those warnings are, the consequences of them, and ultimately why a particular verdict has been reached. This was so held by the High Court in Fleming v R (1998) 197 CLR 250.
	
	
	In a criminal trial the onus of proof rests with the prosecution from the beginning of the trial to the end of the trial in respect of matters requiring proof by the prosecution. In respect of those matters the accused bears no onus whatsoever. The onus of proof does not shift to the accused in respect of matters requiring proof by the Crown. An accused person is presumed to be innocent of any charge or charges brought against him or her until such time as that presumption is displaced by the Crown proving the essential elements or ingredients of the particular charge brought against the accused.
	
	
	In this matter, however, once the relevant elements of the charge brought against the accused are established, there is a statutory defence provided for in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the legislation under which the accused has been charged. The Court is required to have regard to the combined operation of s 25 and s 29 of that Act and I will deal with the details of that matter later.
	
	
	The defence required to be established by the accused is one to be established on the balance of probabilities, that is, it is for the accused to establish that it is more probable than not that what he has to establish has been so established. In this regard I note the accused did not give evidence in the trial although he did voluntarily, and in some detail, participate in an electronic interview. He also, in the course of the search the day before, made a number of statements about matters that were brought to his attention by the investigating police.
	
	
	In assessing what was said on 1 August I appreciate, for want of a better description, that the accused was caught by surprise; in fact at one point early in the search before the warrant was shown to the accused and he was handed the occupier’s notice the accused was seen running, it would seem, from the house to the shed where subsequent searches were conducted, and/or back again, in his underpants.
	
	
	I must say, and I make very clear, that I draw no inference adverse to the appellant from his conduct in that respect when the police announced their office and their presence. His conduct was entirely consistent with a person who was in possession of a substantial quantity of prohibited drugs, which he admits, and was not necessarily consistent with a person having in his possession a quantity of prohibited drugs in his possession for the purposes of supply. So his conduct at relevant times is a neutral matter, particularly in that respect.
	
	
	In respect of the accused not giving evidence I bear in mind that in respect of matters required to be proven by the Crown he bears no onus of proof. There is no obligation upon him even in respect of matters where he bears some burden of proof for him to give evidence in Court. No inference can be drawn adverse to him by his failure to give evidence and I bear in mind as I said earlier that he gave an interview openly and frankly to police shortly after the search of his premises.
	
	
	Everyone facing trial by judge or by judge and jury is entitled to remain silent in Court and put the Crown to proof, and I cannot draw any adverse inference against the accused because he has exercised his right to silence in Court. On the other hand, in relation to matters where he bears the burden of proof in determining whether matters are established, it means apart from any other evidence or material produced by the accused, and the accused did produce exhibit 1, I am required to consider the matters raised by the accused in the context of the evidence in the Crown case as well as, of course, as I said, the exhibit he produced, considering rational or reasonable or possible inferences arising from that evidence.
	
	
	I cannot interpret the silence of the accused in Court as an acknowledgment by him as to the accuracy, veracity or strength of the Crown case. I certainly cannot be tempted to reason that the accused has remained silent because he believes he is guilty. Such reasoning is prohibited and I am not allowed to engage in it and I will not. It is entirely inconsistent with the burden of proof resting upon the prosecution. It is not for me to speculate as to why the accused did not give evidence and I cannot treat the accused’s election not to give evidence as being capable of filling any gaps in the Crown case that may be perceived to exist.
	
	
	In order to establish the guilt of an accused person in relation to the count, the prosecution must prove each and all of the essential ingredients or elements of the charge for consideration beyond reasonable doubt. The words “beyond reasonable doubt” are to be given their ordinary, everyday English meaning and as I said earlier the accused bears no onus in relation to those matters requiring proof by the prosecution in that regard.
	
	
	The words “beyond reasonable doubt” are a very high standard of proof. If a reasonable doubt exists in relation to matters requiring proof by the prosecution I must find the accused ‘not guilty’. Likewise if the Crown establishes all the relevant elements of the charge but I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities the accused has discharged the onus upon him to establish the defence, I must find him ‘not guilty’.
	
	
	I now turn to the elements of the charge and the character of the defence. The accused is charged, as I said earlier, with the offence of supplying the prohibited drug, amphetamine. The Crown does not have to prove, however, that the accused actually supplied that drug in accordance with the operation of s 25 and 29 of the Act. What the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt are, firstly, that there was a substance that was a prohibited drug; secondly, that the accused possessed that substance, and thirdly, that the accused possessed that substance for the purposes of supply.
	
	
	The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the substance the accused supplied was a prohibited drug and here the Crown alleges that the prohibited drug was amphetamine. The law is that under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and the Schedules to it the drug ‘amphetamine’ is a prohibited drug and as it turned out, getting somewhat ahead of myself, as the case was conducted and as the evidence established, there is no dispute as to the fact that the relevant substance the subject of the charge is amphetamine. The accused believed it to be or has certainly believed it to be an amphetamine-type substance.
	
	
	I am very mindful of the fact that there are different types of amphetamine substance, including methylamphetamine and methamphetamine as well as amphetamine itself but I must be satisfied that the relevant substance the subject of the charge contained the prohibited drug particularised in the indictment.
	
	
	It is not necessary that the prosecution prove that the whole of the substance consisted of that prohibited drug. The law is that anything that contains a prohibited drug in any proportion is sufficient, as it turned out, by reference to the analyst’s certificate in this matter which is part of the Crown case, the first exhibit tendered by the Crown and one which the accused agreed to be tendered at the outset to save the analyst having to travel to Broken Hill. The certificate establishes that the purity of the relevant substance, or at least 77.6 grams of it, was 38%.
	
	
	Secondly, the Crown must prove the accused possessed the prohibited drug. The Crown must prove that the accused intentionally had the substance in his physical custody or control to the exclusion of any other person. If there be a suggestion of joint possession, which does not arise in this trial as I understand the matter, the Crown must prove that the accused intentionally had the substance in some place to which he had access and might go to obtain physical custody or control of it to the exclusion of any other person.
	
	
	In respect of this matter, for reasons I will explain later by reference to the evidence, it is clear, based upon the physical evidence of the searching of the premises and the voluntary admissions made by the accused at various times, that the accused possessed the relevant prohibited drug.
	
	
	I direct myself in accordance with the ‘Bench Book’ as to the matters of knowledge and belief required for the purposes of being in possession of a particular item. I appreciate, of course, the fact that the relevant matters discussed in the Bench Book directions, for example, are obviously matters that must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	I interpose in my remarks to point out that I gave the accused at the outset of the trial a somewhat edited extract from the Bench Book setting out relevant matters to the issues that the prosecution must prove as well as the ‘defence’. The Crown must further prove that the accused had the substance in his possession for the purpose of supply. To supply something under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act involves an extended definition of the word “supply”. The ordinary meaning of the word “supply” is to give or provide something to somebody. It may include, under the Act, selling and other acts but in this matter the Crown does not have to prove that the accused actually supplied the drug in accordance with the general understanding of that word or its statutory definition.
	
	
	For the purposes of determining the offence, the word “supply” includes “having a substance which is a prohibited drug for the purposes of giving it to somebody”. A particular issue that arises under s 29, is that if an accused person has in his possession a specified quantity or more of a prohibited drug, that person is regarded as having possession of that drug for the purposes of supply, that is to give it or provide it to another person.
	
	
	In relation to this particular drug of amphetamine, I am informed by the Crown that the traffickable quantity is three grams and the indictable quantity is five grams. The accused is alleged to have been in possession of 97.4 grams in total. If I am satisfied that the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the offence, including that the drug was a prohibited drug as particularised in the indictment, and the amount of the drug was at least the traffickable quantity, then the prosecution has proved all the essential ingredients or facts to make out the offence of supply.
	
	
	However, there is a defence to this charge, as I have said. What the accused needs to prove on the balance of probabilities is that the accused had the drug in his possession for some purpose other than to supply it. In other words, to give it or to provide it to someone else, and that has been the accused’s position from the outset.
	
	
	In fairness to him, from the moment I first saw him - which was last week when I was endeavouring to have him come to Court to ascertain what the situation was in the trial (he was then, as I understood it, represented by a solicitor and a barrister who subsequently withdrew) - he indicated to me, after it had been made clear to me that he had quite voluntarily severed his relationship from his legal advisers, that he was claiming that the drugs the subject of the charge were for his “personal use,” to use his words.
	
	
	While the onus of proving this fact rests on the accused, he does not have to prove it, as I said, to the high standard of proof of beyond reasonable doubt. He is required to prove it on the balance of probabilities, that is that it is more likely than not that he had the drug in his possession for purposes other than supply. Of course, personal use is a purpose other than supply.
	
	
	There are other circumstances, some of which I explained to the accused at an early stage about this aspect of the law. Ultimately, if I am satisfied of that matter, I will acquit the accused.
	
	
	There are some other legal directions I am required to give myself. In this matter an expert witness was called John Farrar, who was described as a clinical pharmacologist. His qualifications and his experience and the basis of some of his opinions were the subject of evidence by him. An expert witness is a person who has specialised knowledge based upon that person’s training study or experience. Unlike other witnesses, a witness with such specialised knowledge may express an opinion on matters within his or her particular area of expertise.
	
	
	Other witnesses may speak only as to facts, that is what they saw or heard, and are not permitted to express their opinion save for the exception of lay witnesses expressing opinions about matters that might be within common experience, such as the estimate of distances, the estimate of the speed of a motor vehicle or a motorcycle, and some such matters.
	
	
	Of course, the value of an expert opinion is very much dependent upon the reliability and accuracy of the material which the expert used to reach his opinion. It is also dependent upon the degree to which the expert analysed the material upon which the opinion was based and the skill and experience brought to bear in formulating the opinion given.
	
	
	Experts can differ in the level and degree of their experience, training and study. Yet each can still be an expert qualified to give an opinion where the opinion is based upon the witness’ specialised knowledge. In this matter expert evidence was admitted to provide the Court with evidence in relation to matters concerning the drug amphetamine, its qualities, its characteristics, its effects.
	
	
	There was also evidence given about the uses that can be made of amphetamines by reference to the opinion expressed as to the different type of amphetamine or the different forms of amphetamine that are known. This opinion evidence and other material emerging from the witness’ evidence is evidence that is given to be likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of the average lay person.
	
	
	One of the issues that arises in a criminal trial where the judge sits alone is that a judge of any experience would have had many occasions not only to hear ‘experts’ give evidence, but also to hear drug users and drug manufacturers, drug suppliers, as well as police officers, give evidence about matters relating to the characteristics of drugs, the value of drugs, in particular quantities, in particular locations, on particular dates and also have knowledge of some of the effects of prohibited drugs that are used from time to time.
	
	
	To a large extent I am required to put those matters aside, of course, and I approach the matter by reference to the material produced by the accused and the opinion of the pharmacologist using my common sense.
	
	
	I will come back to the evidence of the Mr Farrar. I make the point though that the law requires me that if I do not accept the evidence of the expert I do not have to act upon it. This is particularly so where the facts upon which the opinion is based do not accord with the facts as I find them to be, or alternatively that the opinion expressed stands at odds with reliable evidence from other sources even if it does not come from experts.
	
	
	I bear in mind, of course, the difficulty for the accused. It must be fairly said, I believe of his own choosing, that no other expert evidence has been called. No application was made for such a person to be called by the accused. Of course, he would have had to make those arrangements himself. But I do understand, of course, that one of the essential opinions expressed by Mr Farrar, which I will come back to, is in some dispute by reference to the representations the accused made in the course of the interview when he made relevant admissions.
	
	
	In any event, even without conflict between the opinion of the expert and any other evidence in the case that might contradict the expert, I am not obliged to accept the pharmacologist’s opinion or any expert’s opinion or, if I accept the opinion, I may choose in the circumstances of the matter to give the opinion little or no weight even if I believe the opinion is properly held.
	
	
	In this matter, although the opinion evidence was not challenged largely, there was a challenge to the suggestion the witness made that amphetamine in the form as the witness described it, that is in “salt form” - that is amphetamine characterised as amphetamine sulphate - in his opinion cannot be smoked. When one analyses his evidence, however, (I do not have a transcript of his evidence but I have made very careful notes) that opinion is not as bald and as straight-forward as it might seem in the manner in which it was first expressed, although I do not criticise the witness for that. He was endeavouring to make a more subtle point which I will deal with shortly.
	
	
	With regard to the evidence in the case I have dealt with it to this point in a global fashion by reference to some of the witnesses that were called. I should point out that there was an endeavour to produce a detective who was going to express opinions about the value of amphetamine drugs in Broken Hill. There were a couple of difficulties with that evidence it seemed to me.
	
	
	Firstly, as the witness was called to the witness box I discovered the witness was, in fact, a detective who had only been in Broken Hill since 2014.
	
	
	I accept that he had some prior experience with the AFP and had experience as a detective elsewhere in the State. I respect the fact that in appropriate occasions appropriately experienced and qualified police officers may be called upon to express opinions about matters relevant to the dissemination and the sale of prohibited drugs. But it seemed to me, given the information helpfully provided by the Crown, that the evidence was evidence that I could not act upon with confidence. Not because I doubt the integrity of the detective - I never really got to know him beyond seeing him in Court - but because the matters about which he was going to give evidence concerned opinions based upon his experience in the past elsewhere, and in Broken Hill since 2014.
	
	
	I was given some indication of what he might say. It seemed to me, with respect, to be at odds in some minor detail or perhaps some substantial detail with evidence in a sentence matter I heard here during these sittings where a man was convicted of supplying methylamphetamine, which I appreciate is a different drug, and his various transactions were recorded by telephone intercepts. Perhaps the best evidence you could have of value for particular quantities. Anyway, be that as it may, the Crown considered the matter and chose not to call the witness and I did not have to make a decision about the admissibility of that evidence or alternatively its weight. Even though I was put on notice of what was to be said it is a matter now of no moment.
	
	
	With regard to the evidence of Senior Constable Tucker, Constable Chambers and Sergeant Gallagher, I note that out of the execution of the search warrant, which is an exhibit, and the service of the occupier’s notice, which is an exhibit in these proceedings, a number of items were recovered at various places.
	
	
	Exhibit D constitutes 23 photographs of various items, a couple of them quite out of focus and not much help. There is an exhibits log that was produced by Constable Chambers which I have paid heed to. It is materially inconsistent in one respect with what I thought was asserted without the aid of transcript by one of the witnesses and I will come back to that matter in a moment. I have, of course, the copy of the search warrant, exhibit F, and the occupier’s notice.
	
	
	Although I permitted the evidence of the search to proceed with no objection from the accused - although the accused might not be in a position to understand the legal ramifications and the complexities of search warrants - I took that evidence without comment until such time as I was in a position to seek further material to satisfy me that the relevant provisions of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (LEPRA) had been met.
	
	
	Although the accused did not object to the evidence of the search either on grounds available under s 138 potentially, or some other section of the Evidence Act, it was my duty to ensure that all matters relating to the legality of the issue of a search warrant and the execution of a search warrant were before the Court.
	
	
	I appreciate at various times the accused from the bar table said things like everything was “properly done”, everything is “right”, he had no dispute with the evidence and the like, but my obligation, as I have explained to the accused on a number of occasions, is to conduct the trial according to law and that requires me to take positive steps to ensure that has happened. I mean no disrespect to the Crown Prosecutor, but it is not my job to be content to accept the self-satisfaction of the Crown or anybody else about matters relating to the legality of actions of investigators. Having said that and having viewed the video I have satisfied myself as far as I can that the provisions of LEPRA have been complied with and that there was no impropriety in the execution of a search warrant.
	
	
	I should point out, as the transcript would reveal, that there was an issue that I raised as to the basis upon which the warrant was issued. The law requires an application. An application was produced to the Court. A copy of that was shown to the accused as were two statements from police officers which were not tendered, nor shown to me, I hasten to say. Those statements remain in a sealed envelope not to be opened by anyone other than a judge of this Court or a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. But I asked the accused, he having seen that material, whether he would wish me to see the application.
	
	
	I was reluctant to see it and I expressed my reluctance to him. But he said I should see it. To satisfy myself of the legality of the matter, I read that application. It satisfies me of the ‘reasonable grounds’ in the context of what that legislation involves, although I ignore the information contained therein.
	
	
	With regard to what was ultimately recovered from the property, the accused readily and voluntarily admitted, both during the course of the search and subsequently in the course of the interview, his awareness of items found said to be relevant to the investigation and his possession of them.
	
	
	The video shows him to be co-operative and sometimes inquiring when he needed to obtain further information. As I said earlier, the police were polite and non forceful and everything occurred in a very “gentlemanly” fashion to the extent that, although the police had material in their possession that might reasonably have been believed to be amphetamine and a substantial quantity of it, rather than the accused being arrested on the spot and being taken to the police station, as one often sees, a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ was reached that the accused should make his way to the police station the following day, which he did.
	
	
	During the course of the search, the accused did not appear to be affected by drugs or alcohol, and did not claim at any stage to be incapacitated. It is quite clear to me, although some of the conversations are hard to hear - some things said by the accused cannot be heard at all and that is no fault of anyone it is just the inadequacy of the recording equipment that created that situation – he appeared to fully understand what was being said and responded cogently and coherently to questions and, as far as I could hear, his comments were unequivocal statements.
	
	
	I note, in relation to the objective evidence relating to the search, the premises in which he lived had security cameras attached to various parts of the house. I do not have a plan of where they were located but I understand from the evidence that in the bedroom there was a monitor or screen which showed at least four views of different parts of the property provided by those security cameras.
	
	
	When the property was searched at various places various items were found and I will summarise those items now. Firstly, $2,370 was found in the drawer of a chest of drawers or a cupboard in the main bedroom or, as it was described, the accused’s bedroom. There was $280 in bank notes in what could be called the cashbox of what is seen in the video to be an electronic poker machine that was in a shed in the rear of the backyard of the premises which was when first approached by police locked and secured.
	
	
	The police found a set of keys as I understand it in the main bedroom. I may have misunderstood the evidence but my note was behind a ‘bedhead’ in the bedroom. The location is of no significance. The keys included a key to the shed and a key to a safe which was found inside the shed and inside which the relevant prohibited drugs were found. As I understand the evidence, no prohibited drugs were found inside the house, only in the shed.
	
	
	With regard to the prohibited drugs, there were a quantity of drugs found in two smaller resealable bags inside one larger plastic bag. These substances were described as orange/brown crystalline substances and as I understand it these items constitute item 4 of the items that are referred to in the analyst’s certificate which is the substance identified with the prohibited drug of amphetamine in a quantity of 77.6 grams with a purity of 38%.
	
	
	Inside the safe, which had to be unlocked with the key, in the presence of the accused was found a sunglasses case with three smaller resealable bags. As I understand it this is item 5 on the analyst’s certificate, which substance is amphetamine of a quantity of 19.8 grams. In any event, whatever be the packaging, the combined total of the prohibited drugs located as I have earlier indicated was 97.4 grams.
	
	
	There were also found eight glass pipes which had appearances consistent with their use to smoke some particular drug. Those pipes as I understand it were not analysed. I am not provided with any evidence as to what the residue was inside those pipes. A plate was found with a substance on it, a very small quantity of substance which as I understand it when analysed detected the prohibited drug methyl amphetamine in the weight of 0.47 grams. There were some items containing various liquids which were analysed but no drugs were detected.
	
	
	Police found in various places in the shed eight sim cards for phones as I would understand it. There were other USB sticks and other equipment. Evidence was given of the finding of five mobile phones. I can only find four mobile phones in the log. This is the matter of distinction between the log and the oral evidence. If I have miscounted I apologise but, on my re-reading of the log last night, I could find reference to four mobile phones including one iPhone and one Blackberry phone, the other two phones are not described.
	
	
	As I said earlier, there were two electronic scales found. They are exhibits. They are very small electronic scales which to my mind, and I will deal with this later when analysing the evidence, are not consistent with kitchen scales, which can be electronic as well. I will refer later to what the accused said about those scales. These various items the accused admitted were his after repeated cautioning, as I said, at the time of the search.
	
	
	He also made admissions that the substance the subject of the charge was a prohibited drug. He is recorded as saying, although I have no transcript of the search video, he purchased three ounces of “meth” or amphetamine “a month ago” and he paid about $7,000 for it. He also said at the time he was explaining these matters that the drugs were for his “personal use” and he was going to “smoke it”. He also in the course of the searching of the shed gave reasons for his possession of the pipes to “smoke meth” or to “smoke out of them” and ultimately to destroy them.
	
	
	There was some reference in the evidence to some money bags, a matter by itself that turns out to be not of any significance whatsoever. However, various items, the sim cards, the phones, the scales, the character of the packaging, the security system, the way in which the drugs were secured within the safe, the cash found, are all matters relied upon by the prosecution as supporting what is otherwise deemed by the quantity of the drugs, the Crown’s contention that the drugs were in his possession for the purposes of supply and in rebuttal of the defence available to the accused based upon his assertion that the drugs were for his personal use.
	
	
	With regard to the expert witness, his evidence arose in the context of not only the accused’s assertion that he was going to smoke the drugs at the time of the search, but on the basis of representations the accused made when he was interviewed.
	
	
	As I said, the accused went to the police station the next day and obviously voluntarily involved himself in the interview with the police. In the course of that interview he agreed as to the fact that the various items were found in his house, that he was in possession of them and he provided particulars in relation to these matters.
	
	
	Of necessity, I am required to deal with some detail of the appellant’s answers in the interview, because as it turns out this is substantially his case in the absence of any evidence being given from him. He agreed in essence, although he could not remember the exact amount which I do not hold against him, that $2,665 was found as his property. When asked about the money, if he wished to say anything he said, “I don’t have any comment”, that was for “later”, but I cannot draw any inference adverse to him for that.
	
	
	In relation to the search of the safe, he agreed that it was locked with a particular key and that out of the safe were found various items as well as the pipes. With regard to the pipes he thought eight had been found and he said that he used them to smoke drugs. He was going to eventually crush them up and throw them out. With regard to the item or the substance that was on the plate, he was asked what he thought it was and he said it was:
	


“Like a meth substance of some sort. You could smoke it but when I did it, it sort of turned that discoloured look and I realised well, yeah”.


	
	With regard to the word “meth”, the accused said:
	


“Meth, I have the impression it’s like well, an illegal drug. It’s, well, I know it’s not crystal meth, I know it’s not but it’s some form of meth.”


	
	He said about it being an illegal drug that he assumed it was. He said, “Well, because of the well, the low quality high that it gave me”. This in my view is a matter relevant to the assessment of his claim of smoking the drugs in light of the evidence of the expert. He understood that it was illegal in most States to smoke “meth”, and he said his intention in relation to the meth that he was going to smoke it. He said, “Definitely I’m a drug user” (question 129).
	
	
	He was asked about his knowledge of the expression “points”, a point being 0.1 of a gram. He said as far as the terminology was concerned he was “quite happy with that” on the representation of the police officer, not that a great deal turns upon that, if anything. With regard to the SIM cards, he said that he owned the SIM cards. He said, “I know it’s not illegal to have those sorts of items”, referring to the SIM cards and the USB sticks. He said that he used to store photographs upon them.
	
	
	I note in passing none of this material has been analysed and I have no idea what is contained in the SIM cards. The police officer asserted they located about five phones in the shed. The accused said, “I just like phones, I always have”. He said he used to extract gold from the phones.
	
	
	He was taken to the character of the resealable bags. He described some of the substances as “a crystal looking wet substance” referring to substances within the bags that were described as “deal bags”. He said:
	


“I’d say that would be like a glucose or like a sugar something because obviously when I had a smoke of it, it just went straight to black and it tasted like brown sugar”.


	
	He believed that the relevant drugs were “meth” type drugs.
	
	
	Getting to the significant quantities of the substance, the very subject matter of the charge, it was described to him as a “browny” substance, “crystallised” substance. He called that “a meth based substance that I was smoking”. He said he purchased that drug to smoke. He understood that it was an illegal drug and he thought it was “a meth based substance of some sort”.
	
	
	He said he solely purchased it to smoke himself. He was asked these questions from question 174 onwards:
	


“Q. Where did you purchase it?

A. In Broken Hill.

Q. Would you like to tell me who you purchased it from?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

A. But it was bought in, I bought it out of State but it came into Broken Hill.

Q. So you--

A. It wasn’t anyone from Broken Hill.

Q. So you purchased from someone who came to Broken Hill?

A. Yes.”


	
	In answer to how much was there, he said:
	


“Well, I paid 7,000 for three, apparently three ounces or maybe a touch over with that other bag that came with it”.


	
	He did not know off the top of his head what three ounces in grams would be. He was told that an ounce is roughly 28.4 grams, which is approximately right, and he gave reasons for it being bagged the way it was because of a leaking of the bags. He was asked questions after a caution about the supply of amphetamines in Broken Hill. He denied supplying amphetamines to any other person. He said, “It’s solely for my own use”. He was asked if the quantity that the police had weighed was more than would be required for personal use, described as a “fair bit”.
	
	
	He said, “No, considering the amount that I smoke”. He was asked how much he smoked and he said he would smoke 30 to 40 ‘smokes’ of amphetamine a day. I should point out the reference to 125 grams in the interview as the weight of the drug seized is not a scientific measure. The police were measuring the substance with plastic bags and the like.
	
	
	He said that he bought it in ‘one go’, so to speak, or he bought so much
	


“because it would cut down my chances of being caught buying … off other people and yeah I mean I just bought it in bulk so I never have to go to do it, have to buy it again for a long time so it keep smoking for quite a while (sic).”


	
	He confirmed it was for his personal use. He was asked about the safety of children and the like and he said he normally did not keep it in the house, the drugs would be in a “safe location” which he did not want to elaborate upon. He said “buried out bush, that’s all I can say.” He did not wish to tell the police where that was and he said that in the glass pipes was the residue of a meth based substance, as I earlier said, and he understood that it was illegal to possess the drugs.
	
	
	As far as the safe was concerned he explained the circumstances of purchasing it. He was asked if the sole purpose for the safe was to store his meth or his drugs and he said, “Yeah, my drugs, yeah, yeah”. He was asked about what he did for a job. He said, “No comment at the moment”. He said that he was “self-employed in a way”, he was not receiving any “welfare”, he said that he made money out of making up cars as a hobby. He picked the “right cars and I do make good money from (them)” so a rough estimate throughout the year (of what he earned) “would be maybe 1,200 to 1,800 a week”. He was not a licensed car dealer.
	
	
	He also had an interest in opals; he said he used to be an opal miner. He had sources of income from that, he said, apart from the money he obtained from making cars re saleable. I point out in the evidence that when police arrived at the house there were a number of cars, some in a distressed state so to speak, or in a state of repair or need of repair, on his premises.
	
	
	He was asked about his use of drugs. He said he used to smoke cannabis but it took a toll upon him mentally and he once got a caution for possession of cannabis, he moved to amphetamines. Asked where he got the $7,000 from he said, “That was through cars and opal, yeah, a mixture”. He was asked how much opal he had. He said about “60 to 80,000”, which I take to be a dollar value. He did not have any leases but he had been involved in opal mining as a child since eight years of age and for over 13 years he had collected opal, which apparently he could sell for money. He said he was involved in some form of family business and he got a percentage out of finds made by other people.
	
	
	He said, when asked if he had anything else to say about the matter, that apart from “getting a one hell of an earbashing off the missus”,
	


“I’ve made a mistake and there’s nothing that I can go back on, I can just man up and just face it and deal with it and whatever happens I just have to take it head on and get over it and yeah, hopefully never touch the shit again and just move on.”


	
	It was in this context that Mr Farrar’s evidence is to be considered. He gave evidence about the effect of the use of amphetamines including a feeling of “euphoria”. He talked about the physical effects of amphetamines. The Crown sought to rely upon some aspects of that opinion to demonstrate matters that were said to be apparent from the appearance of the accused in the electronic interview, but I would not permit those opinions to be given. These are matters for experts not for lay people sitting some distance away trying to make detail out of an inadequate video image.
	
	
	Mr Farrar commented upon the analyst’s certificate and he described two forms of amphetamine, one amphetamine sulphate which he described as being in a “salt” form, and he was shown photographs, albeit not entirely clear photographs, of the find and he indicated that that was a “salt” form of amphetamine.
	
	
	There was another form of amphetamine that he described as “freebase”, which is a pure form of amphetamine which was an oily substance. He said in his evidence in salt form the amphetamine was “not able to be smoked” because when lit it “evaporated before it was inhaled as vapour”, as I understood his evidence. In other words he was saying that salt based amphetamine when ignited had the effect that the amphetamine element was destroyed before smoke could be produced.
	
	
	The basis of his opinions in relation to these matters, apart from his scientific qualifications, he said was his experience through reading peer reviewed articles about such subject matter. I am aware of the fact that he prepared a statement and it was provided to the accused, but the Crown did not produce the detail of his curriculum vitae beyond the brief oral evidence that he gave on the topic. He said with regard to the ingestion of amphetamines the primary method of ingestion was either orally, that is mixed with water, or alternatively in salt form using it intravenously, that is mixing it with some sort of solution, saline based or water, and injecting it directly into the vein.
	
	
	He said amphetamine can be converted to a freebase by adding a solvent but that would have the result of producing the “oily substance” to which I earlier referred and the adding of the solvent would mean the oily substance would sit on the top, as I understood it, and the oily substance could then be separated either by a centrifuge or the most basic method would be to use a scoop. He said the oily based substance can be heated and the vapour inhaled to get the intoxicating effect. He expressed opinions about the quantity of prohibited drug that would be used to inject to achieve the effect of the drug. He also expressed opinions about the comparative effects of intravenous use and inhaling through vapour but neither of those opinions were of any moment in this case.
	
	
	Ultimately he concluded that there were two forms of amphetamine, the salt form and the oily substance. He was asked further questions either by myself or the Crown about the question of smoking it. He said ultimately that, of course, the salt form could be ignited and purportedly smoked, but the problem with burning it in that form and smoking it, say from a pipe, one could not get the “high” but there could always be a “placebo effect”. The vapour, as I understand it, produced by the burning would not contain a requisite amount of amphetamine to have the effect that amphetamine is expected to give.
	
	
	In relation to the Crown case the Crown says that it has proven the existence of prohibited drug under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the possession of the accused and a quantity in excess of a trafficable quantity. There is absolutely no doubt that that is true and that is not disputed by the accused.
	
	
	With regard to the accused’s case, taking into account everything that happened in the course of the search, his account to the police in the interview and of course exhibit 1, the accused says the expert is wrong. He says that he did smoke the subject of the charge, pointing to the existence of the pipes. I must say, some of these matters the accused said are not just submissions but in part evidence from the bar table.
	
	
	He was, I could see, somewhat inhibited by inexperience in making submissions. He also said that he had the means to purchase the drug and to use it himself, without needing to supply it to others, from the income from cars and savings that he referred to from the sale of opal.
	
	
	He also relied in this regard upon exhibit 1. Exhibit 1 is a somewhat incomplete document. But it is a letter to the accused indicating the fact that there had been a sale of two properties apparently in which he had an interest. I am prepared to accept for the purposes of determining this matter he specifically owned them. This is a letter dated 22 October 2014 addressed to the accused at Chapple Street Broken Hill. It indicates that there was a settlement effected in relation to two properties in Broken Hill in December 2013 and that the accused owed still $684 in legal fees.
	
	
	The letter is a business record. I am prepared to accept the representations contained in it that the accused had an interest in two properties in Broken Hill. They were conveyanced by a firm of solicitors and the settlement occurred in December 2013. Of course that settlement occurred after the accused was arrested in relation to the current matters, in fact it would seem three or four months after. But the accused said in court, and I am prepared to accept it even though it came from the bar table, that he received approximately $20,000 from that combined sale in either 2011 or 2012 and the settlement was in effect some formalisation of an informal arrangement between friends. I do not have any reason to doubt that and I have taken that matter into account.
	
	
	In relation to the scales he said in his submission they could be used for other purposes. In a sense he gave evidence from the bar table but he made the point that they could be used, as he said in the interview, for weighing opals, measuring size by carat rather than grams, although the scales could also measure in grams.
	
	
	The phones had no SIM cards as I noted from the evidence. He said that he collected them, he had an interest in them and he would extract gold from them for the purposes presumably of some resale. He said the SIM cards were unrelated to the phones, there was no evidence of their connection with the phone; they were separate. He asserted a purpose for them. There is no evidence, I hasten to say, produced to indicate some relationship between the number of SIM cards and drug dealership per se. There are inferences that can be drawn from multiple phones and multiple SIM cards. It is well known from the prosecution and resolution of cases involving the supply of prohibited drugs that multiple mobile phones may be used to supply drugs but the accused asserts that in the absence of any evidence to show telephone calls related to drug supply or a pattern of use of phones for that purpose his account should be accepted.
	
	
	He asserted in his submissions that what he said about smoking 30 to 40 times a day was so and, as I would understand his submission, that even if Mr Farrar was essentially right he would smoke many times because of that “minimal effect”. He also said that he did not necessarily smoke a point a time and I do not see in the interview that he agreed that he smoked a point at a time; he could have smoked less. I note, as I say, in relation to the pipes nobody took the effort to analyse the residue in the pipes. But the essence of the submission is somewhat contradictory.
	
	
	He said in his submissions he would ask the Court to take into account that he had cash from his personal circumstances, he had no need to sell drugs to recoup his expenditure, and he also would say, although he did not expressly address this, that the cash that was found was consistent with his, if I could call it, informal involvement in the trade of motor vehicles. Particularly “muscle cars”, as they are described, and that the security system in his home was just consistent with protecting his property particularly valuable things that he might have in his property such as opals.
	
	
	I note of course that from the search undertaken of his house, whilst some costume jewellery of no moment was found, there were no opals found either. Where they were, if they exist, if they were at the premises or buried in the bush, I do not know.
	
	
	To come back to the Crown’s submissions, essentially relating to the ‘defence’, the Crown says when one has regard to the quantity of the drug, the accused’s explanation of how he was proposing to use the drug, the amount he paid for it, the number of phones, the number of SIM cards, the cash partly hidden in the safe or the strongbox of the poker machine, the manner of the hiding of the drugs, the existence of the scales, the security arrangements and the packaging, the Court could not be satisfied the accused had discharged the onus upon him.
	
	
	I note in the consideration of this matter a number of features of it, some of which I have already pointed out. There is no evidence of any particular activity by the accused, independently of what I have outlined, consistent with drug supply. There is no evidence of any ledgers or recordings of transactions. Although the Crown case is not one of actual supply, I appreciate that it concentrates on the possession of the quantity of the drugs, I have not been favoured with any phone records of any phone service related to the accused. There has been no examination of the SIM card content and of course I note the evidence that was given by, I believe Sergeant Gallagher, that the phones that were found did not have SIM cards in them. No examination of the scales was made to ascertain whether there is any residue of drugs in them, although of course if drugs were weighed in plastic bags and the like no residue may necessarily be found.
	
	
	I note the evidence of the possession of pipes, clearly evidence consistent with smoking some form of drug. It is consistent with the account that the accused gave to the police. I am prepared to accept on balance that the accused was from time to time a smoker of drugs. What particular drugs is one of the issues in the case. Notwithstanding the opinion of the pharmacologist I accept that the accused on balance did endeavour to smoke amphetamine type substances and in fact speaks in the interview of matters that might reflect an absence of what might be called the therapeutic or other effect of the prohibited drugs. But it is not clear that he tried to smoke the drug the subject of the charge.
	
	
	In fact in dealing with this matter ultimately, whilst the pharmacologist’s opinions as I have summarised them are of some assistance in providing a context, the opinion of the pharmacologist concerning the smoking of amphetamine ultimately is a neutral matter in the proceedings in the context of the representations by the accused. The concession ultimately that the drug itself could be smoked, but with almost no effect although the possibility of a placebo effect, underlines a matter that might be in support of the accused, but the case will not turn upon this aspect of the matter.
	
	
	I must confess I was a little concerned, the witness having left the box, about some of the assumptions or bases for expressing his particular opinions about the smoking of drugs. I look back on the matter and perhaps it was a neglect on my part to ask the question that was not asked, and I do not expect the accused to ask this question, “tell us precisely, Mr Farrar, what is in your opinion the chemical explanation for that particular aspect of your opinion”, or some such question. Anyway, but the matter does not turn upon that aspect.
	
	
	I note the accused’s explanation of the usage of the drugs. However ultimately there are other aspects to take into account. Firstly, the quantity of the drugs is a significant quantity. I appreciate in the circumstances of this case what would be a regular usage by the accused in terms of quantity would be an entirely speculative matter, but even if the accused was to use as much as .5 of a gram a day theoretically that would involve something in the order of 194 days of usage, used on a regular basis.
	
	
	I take into account the fact that the drugs were a valuable commodity and capable of a profitable return on distribution, although there is no evidence of distribution.
	
	
	I have ultimately concluded that the accused, in the circumstances as he explained, was unlikely to have such a large quantity at the time of the detection by the police, solely for personal use. The impression the accused’s account gave to the police was that because of the problem with cannabis that I have referred to in the interview he had taken to the use of amphetamines relatively recently. He did not expressly say so, but one would wonder, in the absence of any admission or representation that he was an experienced meth smoker, why a person in these circumstances, having turned from cannabis, would obtain such a large quantity for smoking in circumstances where I am prepared to accept that the effect on each smoking occurrence would be minimal.
	
	
	I appreciate that the circumstances identified by the Crown from the evidence, the surrounding circumstances, security systems, the use of safes, packaging, cash, multiple mobile phones, multiple SIM cards, are indicia of either past drug supply or potential future drug supply. I appreciate of course that there are possibly innocent explanations for each of these matters in the context of the representations by the accused to the police but there is no convincing evidence, in my view, in the matter that persuades me on balance that the only purpose of many of the indicia referred to by the Crown was for an innocent purpose, as is argued by the accused.
	
	
	I appreciate, of course, when one is looking at surrounding circumstances to the primary issue of the possession of a particular quantity of prohibited drugs, no particular circumstances may be compelling. That certainly is the case in this matter. But ultimately the fact of the matter is these indicia, arising from the search, suggest connection with the prohibited drug for purposes other than personal use of drugs. There remains still from the accused’s version possibilities consistent with the account that he has given and these matters are all matters to be weighed up in the mix of considerations as to whether the accused has discharged the onus of proof to the standard required.
	
	
	I believe that there is, in the account given by the accused about how he purchased the drug, a material inconsistency, perhaps explained by a use of loose language, between the account he gave on 1 August as to where he bought the drug and the account he gave in the interview. This at first seemed ambiguous, but was clarified to indicate the drugs were brought to Broken Hill from some other place that I am prepared to assume was Adelaide. It may be a matter of no moment but in my view the account given by the accused at the time of the execution of the search warrant does have that inconsistency with his later version.
	
	
	Another matter that I take into account is the accused told the police, at least during the course of the search, that he purchased 3 ounces, or just over, “a month before”. But if it was true that he was smoking 30 or 40 times a day, even allowing for the fact that he smoked on each occasion less than a point, he still had in his possession at the time of his arrest 97 grams.
	
	
	My calculation, bearing in mind I would calculate something in the order of 28.3 something grams per ounce, is that 3 ounces would be 89 grams. He had in his possession, it would seem to me, at least three and a quarter ounces of the prohibited drug amphetamine in circumstances where he had asserted, as I understood it, that he was a regular smoker of that particular drug, that he had in his possession at that particular time for that period beforehand. The quantity he possessed on arrest does not reconcile easily with his claimed smoking habits.
	
	
	I appreciate of course the accused is entitled to his right to silence and I have taken on face value the various representations that he has made, but even considering exhibit 1, there is no evidence supportive of some of the assertions he made about the circumstances in which he financed his lifestyle, including the purchase of the drugs. I bear in mind, of course, the evidence he gives about his income and other matters is relevant to not only his capacity to buy the drug but the lack of need of course for him to supply the drug.
	
	
	A person who is extremely wealthy, let us imagine some multimillionaire, might be able to afford a pound of cocaine that he or she could use for many months into the future without the need to sell it. I understand that. But in this particular case the accused gave an account of having some sort of bank or reservoir of income from the sale of opal that he had accumulated over a period of time. No opal was found by the police. No opals have been produced to the police in the course of the investigation. He gave an account of the repair of cars but no evidence other than his untested assertion exists about that matter. What he said about those matters could be true but there is no evidence to support him in that regard.
	
	
	There is also the issue of hiding the items in the bush. If one hid the prohibited drug in the bush so as not to have it detected, perhaps by police, why would one bring it from the bush in total back into the house for a period of time if one was only using it for smoking. If the accused needed a quantity to smoke and he wished to hide it in the bush, as he asserted in the interview, one would have thought the reasonable thing to do was to bring it to the house in small quantities, not to bring it, in effect ‘holus bolus’, including the safe, back into the premises in the circumstances in which the police found it.
	
	
	The circumstances in which the drug was found, having regard to the quantity, is inconsistent with personal use. That the drugs should be found by the police in the manner in which they were found given the explanation the accused gave for securing or keeping the drugs, bearing in mind I understand his explanation for buying such a large quantity in bulk, it is difficult to understand why he should purchase such a large quantity in bulk without a guarantee that it would serve the purpose for which he purchased it..
	
	
	I take into account, as I have said earlier, there are a number of indicia consistent with supply. The character of the scales and the number of them, the multiple phones and SIM cards, security system, the hiding or the securing of the drugs in the safe, the securing of some of the cash in what appears to be a secure cashbox within a poker machine as a place where cash could be secreted.
	
	
	I appreciate the possibility in each instance of an innocent explanation for all of these matters in light of the representations made by the accused. But those ‘innocent explanations’ have no greater weight, in combination, than the inference(s) favourable to purposes of supply.
	
	
	When the matter is ultimately analysed, noting all matters, it is my view in the context of the very substantial quantity of the drug, that I could not be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defence required to be established by the accused has been made out. Thus, in these circumstances I find the accused guilty of the charge.

Count 1 – Demand money with menaces contrary to s 99 Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 years).

Count 2 – Assault with intent to rob while armed with an offensive weapon contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty imprisonment for 20 years).


	
	On 26 June 2014 Wilson DCJ sentenced the applicant as follows:
	


Count 1 – Imprisonment for a fixed term of 9 months, commencing 17 January 2014 and expiring 16 October 2014.

Count 2 – Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months commencing 17 April 2014 and expiring 16 December 2016 with a balance of term of 1 year and 1 month expiring 16 January 2018.


	
	The total sentence was imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 11 months.
	


Factual background


	
	At about 6am on 17 January 2014 the applicant was a passenger in a motor vehicle which drove to the intersection of Market and Boulder Streets in Fingal Bay. The applicant alighted from the vehicle and went towards shops in Market Street with the hood of his jacket over his head and his face concealed by wrapping a green coloured shirt about it and wearing sunglasses. The persons with him remained in the vehicle.
	
	
	The applicant entered the Fingal Bay Café and walked towards the counter. He encountered the milkman, who was delivering milk and pointed a four-inch long silver object, which was described as a blade, at the milkman and told him to “get back”. The use of this blade against the milkman did not form any part of the offence.
	
	
	Having caused the milkman to move out of the way, the applicant directed his attention to the owner who was behind the counter The applicant yelled, “Give me the money, give me the money”. The owner told the applicant that there was no money.
	
	
	The applicant, not being satisfied with that response, reached over the counter, opened the cash register, and felt inside the till. Because the till did not contain any money, the applicant ran from the store to the car where his associates were waiting. The engine of the car was running, and as soon as the applicant entered it, the car drove away (Count 1).
	
	
	The car containing the applicant and his associates drove to the Shoal Bay shopping area. The applicant alighted from the car and went towards the Shoal Bay Newsagency while his associates remained in the car.
	
	
	As he entered the Shoal Bay Newsagency, the applicant was wearing the same clothing, including the hood and the green coloured shirt wrapped about his face. The applicant walked up to one of two employees and said, “Give me the money”, pushing his hand forward in her direction. The employee (Ms Miller) saw that the applicant was armed with a blade which she estimated to be three and a half to four inches long.
	
	
	Ms Miller did not hand over any money because the second of the two employees working in the shop that morning grabbed an umbrella pole which was kept inside the front door of the newsagency. He held the pole above his head and directed the applicant in firm language to get out of the newsagency. The applicant did as he was told and said, “I’m going” and ran from the store to the waiting vehicle. When he got back into the vehicle, he and his associates drove away (Count 2).
	
	
	At the time of this second offence, the police were responding to the earlier offence committed at the Fingal Bay Café. Upon hearing a radio broadcast about the second crime, police diverted to Shoal Bay, obtained some information about the vehicle that was used by the applicant and his associates, and began to search for it.
	
	
	At about 7.15am the applicant was seated in the back seat of the vehicle when it was stopped by the police. Police searched the vehicle and located the clothing which the applicant had worn during the commission of the two offences. The applicant, together with his associates, was arrested and taken to the Raymond Terrace Police Station. The applicant denied any involvement saying that he had briefly blacked out around the time of the offences.
	


Proceedings on sentence


	
	The sentencing judge acknowledged the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty and allowed a discount of 25%.
	
	
	Her Honour regarded both offences as serious. She noted that the offence of demanding money with menaces was committed against the owner of a café and takeaway business, who opened his premises at an early hour, at a time when there would be very few customers and the streets were quiet. Her Honour found that the menace offered on that occasion was in the applicant’s presentation, rather than any threat of particular harm. Her Honour noted that small business operators were vulnerable to this sort of crime, particularly when committed at an early hour when streets might be deserted and there might be little prospect of assistance. Nevertheless, her Honour determined that the circumstances of this offence placed it at the lower end of any notional range of objective gravity. Her Honour found that there was little planning involved, other than an attempt by the applicant to disguise his appearance. She noted that the applicant desisted immediately on discovering that there was no money in the cash register. Her Honour took into account that the owner of the café must have been alarmed by what had transpired.
	
	
	Her Honour regarded the s 97(1) offence as more serious. It occurred a very short time after the commission of the offence in Count 1. The applicant again attempted to conceal his face. On entering the newsagency the applicant produced the knife or blade and demanded that Ms Miller give him money. The applicant failed in his attempt, not because he willingly gave it up but because of the opportune intervention of the other newsagency employee who frightened him away.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that as with the earlier offence, the applicant chose to commit his crime against a small business which opened at an early hour at a time when few people were on the streets. Her Honour took into account that Ms Miller, like other employees of newsagencies, petrol stations and the like, was vulnerable to this type of crime. Her Honour took into account that Ms Miller must have been frightened by the applicant and the blade pushed towards her. Her Honour considered that the causing of fear and distress in an offence of this kind went to its gravity. Her Honour did not regard the applicant’s failure to obtain any cash or other property as significantly reducing the criminality, since it was only the intervention of the fellow employee that prevented his success.
	
	
	Her Honour took into account the applicant’s subjective case. The applicant gave evidence and also relied upon a psychological report by Fleur Taylor. At the time of the offending, he was aged 20. He turned 21 on the day before the sentence proceedings. He had a happy and supportive childhood with parents who encouraged him to pursue his education and who demonstrated proper community values. Unfortunately a number of his peers were involved in drugs and crime and exemplified an attitude of disobedience to the law. He came under their influence.
	
	
	Despite being encouraged by his parents, the applicant found school difficult. The psychologist thought that he may have suffered from an undiagnosed Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The applicant left school in year 8 and unsuccessfully attempted to obtain employment. He then drifted into an antisocial lifestyle which was fuelled by substance abuse. He had started using cannabis at age 12, alcohol at 13 and methylamphetamine at age 16. Crime supported these addictions.
	
	
	Her Honour found that despite having just turned 21, the applicant already had quite an extensive criminal record. His offending commenced in 2009 and included driving offences, offences of violence and offences of dishonesty. He had only just finished a sentence when the present offences were committed. Her Honour noted that in relation to those sentences, the applicant had failed to take advantage of the opportunities for rehabilitation offered to him by the courts, despite repeated chances being extended to him.
	
	
	Her Honour stated the following in relation to rehabilitation:
	


“The offender acknowledged in his evidence that drug use had blighted his life and rehabilitating himself was the key to changing his life. He referred to some of the older prisoners he had met whilst in custody and told the Court that he did not want to find himself sharing their fate of a lifetime spent in and out of prison. Whilst in custody the offender wishes to undertake whatever drug rehabilitation programs may be available to him in an attempt to solve his problems with drug use. He has worked in carpentry within the prison system and has enjoyed that employment, expressing a wish to take up similar work upon his release. The offender is to be commended for his desire to rehabilitate himself and his ambition for employment, although it is difficult to be confident that those desires will translate into effective action, having regard to his past inability to take advantage of rehabilitative programs offered to him. His prospects for rehabilitation must be very guarded.”


	
	Her Honour accepted that the applicant had expressed a degree of insight into his crimes. She found that he exhibited a degree of remorse, acknowledging that the victims of his crime would have been frightened and that they should not have been put through such an experience.
	
	
	In relation to special circumstances, her Honour found as follows:
	


“Although the offender has asked the Court to make a finding of special circumstances I am not prepared to make such a finding except in so far as it is necessary to reflect the principle of totality. Setting that aside I do not believe that the circumstances are sufficiently special to justify a variation in the usual sentencing ratio. True it is that the offender will benefit from assistance with rehabilitation from his substance abuse problems, but there is objectively at this stage little evidence upon which to base a conclusion that, if given a longer than usual parole period, the offender will make positive use of it. My understanding of the authorities is that there ought to be some evidence that an offender has the capacity to use a longer than usual period of parole and I do not see that evidence here.”


	
	Her Honour took into account general deterrence. In that regard she referred to the guideline judgment of R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 which stressed the need for courts to impose sentences which properly reflected the criminality involved in a crime which was not just an offence against property, but was committed against individuals. Her Honour concluded that for such crimes, except where there were exceptional circumstances, a full time custodial sentence should be imposed. Her Honour found that there were no exceptional circumstances in relation to this applicant.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that the s 97(1) offence contained a number of the features identified in Henry, although the applicant was entitled to a larger discount because of his early plea of guilty. Because there were two entirely separate and distinct offences, her Honour determined that there should be some degree of accumulation. The degree of accumulation was three months.
	


The appeal


	
	The applicant relies upon a single ground of appeal.
	


The sentencing judge erred in determining whether “special circumstances” existed for the purposes of s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.


	
	The applicant was originally represented by Mr Odgers SC who prepared written submissions in support of this ground. Two days before the date fixed for the hearing, the Court was advised that the applicant would be representing himself. When the matter came on for hearing, the applicant appeared by audio visual link. He advised the Court that he did not wish to make any submissions beyond the written submissions already filed on his behalf. He did, however, advise the Court of what courses he had completed and generally brought the Court up to date concerning his time in custody. He advised the Court that he understood that this evidence would only be used if the Court decided to re-sentence him.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that it was implicit in her Honour’s rejection of a finding of special circumstances that the only basis for such a finding was the fact of accumulation of sentence. She specifically rejected the proposition that the applicant needed a period of extended supervision to assist him in overcoming his drug addiction because there was little evidence that the applicant would make positive use of a longer parole period. The applicant submitted that her Honour’s reasoning on this issue was erroneous in that there was no requirement for a sentencing judge to reach a conclusion that a longer period of release on parole “will” advance the rehabilitation of an offender.
	
	
	In support of that proposition, the applicant identified a number of cases to the effect that it will be a “special circumstance” that there is a “need or desirability” for an extended period of release on parole to facilitate rehabilitation (R v Sellars [2010] NSWCCA 133 per McClellan CJ at CL at [22]; R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240 per Johnson J at [114] – [115]; Jayde Farrell v R [2012] NSWCCA 245 per Hidden J at [22]; PK v R [2012] NSWCCA 263 at [65]).
	
	
	The applicant submitted that while a mere “possibility” or a mere “pious hope” that an extended period of release on parole will facilitate rehabilitation might not be enough, a conclusion that there was a real chance that it will, would be sufficient to establish special circumstances if it was clear that the chances of rehabilitation will be reduced if there is no such extended period. In support of that proposition, the applicant relied upon R v Tuuta [2014] NSWCCA 40 per Bellew J at [57]; R v Carter [2003] NSWCCA 243 per Dunford J at [20].
	
	
	The applicant placed particular reliance upon the following observation by Dunford J:
	


“20    Offenders cannot expect to have the non-parole period reduced to facilitate their rehabilitation unless there are significant positive signs which show that, if allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation is likely to be successful, and not merely a possibility.”


	
	By reference to that statement of principle by Dunford J, the applicant referred the Court to a number of cases which had defined the word “likely”. In this context, the applicant submitted that the word “likely” should be treated as meaning “a real and not remote chance”. It followed, so the applicant submitted, that in this case there was a real and not remote prospect of the applicant being successfully rehabilitated if he were allowed a longer parole period.
	
	
	In support of that proposition, the applicant relied upon the following factual circumstances:
	


The applicant was aged 20 when he committed the offences and had just turned 21 at the time of sentence.

The applicant had been introduced to drugs at a very young age.

The applicant was disappointed at his inability to complete the Drug Court program and expressed a willingness to engage in rehabilitation.

The applicant had gone through drug withdrawal in prison (psychological report).

The psychologist had expressed the opinion that without intensive drug and alcohol focused treatment, the applicant’s risk of relapse was high.

The psychologist opined that to ensure the applicant’s sobriety upon release, he should be engaged with a community based drug and alcohol program.

The prosecutor in the sentence proceedings had conceded that “certainly there are features that would allow your Honour to make a significant finding of special circumstances”.

Consideration


	
	Whether the ratio of the non-parole period to head sentence should be adjusted to less than the 75% prescribed by s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 involves a “discretionary finding of fact” in respect of which this Court will be slow to intervene: Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 at [83]; Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [27]. The decision to find special circumstances is first one of fact to identify the circumstances and secondly, one of judgment to determine that those circumstances justify a lowering of the non-parole period below the statutory ratio: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [73].
	
	
	The presence of circumstances which are capable of constituting special circumstances does not compel the Court to make such a finding and reduce the non-parole period: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [22]. The degree or extent of any adjustment of the “statutory ratio” is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge: R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31]; Trad v R [2009] NSWCCA 56; 194 A Crim R 20 at [33]; MD v R [2015] NSWCCA 37 at [38].
	
	
	In determining the appropriate non-parole period, the sentencing judge’s primary focus should be on assessing the minimum period of actual incarceration necessary to give effect to the multiple purposes of sentencing. In Power v R [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 the plurality (Barwick CJ, Menzies, Stephen and Mason JJ) said:
	


“6   … The judge, in fixing a non-parole period, must, we believe, have regard not to the time within which the paroling authority must consider the prisoner's case but to the time for which the prisoner must remain in confinement. …

7   It is our opinion that the Act as a whole does not convert a sentence of imprisonment from a punishment into an opportunity for rehabilitation. … In a true sense the non-parole period is a minimum period of imprisonment to be served because the sentencing judge considers that the crime committed calls for such detention.

…

10   To read the legislation in the way we have suggested fulfils the legislative intention to be gathered from the terms of the Act, i.e. to provide for mitigation of the punishment of the prisoner in favour of his rehabilitation through conditional freedom, when appropriate, once the prisoner has served the minimum time that a judge determines justice requires that he must serve having regard to all the circumstances of his offence.”


	
	Similarly, in R v Simpson Spigelman CJ (with whom Mason P, Grove and Sully JJ and Newman AJ agreed) said:
	


“65   In addition to the need to identify and articulate ""special circumstances"", in order to overcome the statutory constraint on the exercise of the discretion to fix a non-parole period, the need to ensure that the time an offender must spend in prison reflects all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender - including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence - operates to confine the proper range for the exercise of the discretion.”


	
	The proposition that the fixing of a non-parole period is a matter that is to be determined solely or primarily by reason of considerations of rehabilitation has been long rejected. In Simpson, Spigelman CJ said:
	


“59   The words ""special circumstances"" appear in numerous statutory provisions. They are words of indeterminate reference and will always take their colour from their surroundings. The sentencing context in which they appear in the present legislation must be understood against the background of a long-standing line of decisions in the High Court, commencing with Power, which emphasises that the non-parole period is to be determined by what the sentencing judge concludes that all of the circumstances of the case, including the need for rehabilitation, indicate ought be the minimum period of actual incarceration. The proposition that the fixing of a non-parole period is a matter that is to be determined solely, or primarily, by reason of considerations of rehabilitation has long since been rejected.”


	
	The report of Ms Taylor, the psychologist, when recording the applicant’s drug and alcohol history recorded that on each of the three occasions he had the opportunity to participate in residential rehabilitation programs through the Drug Court, he had been discharged before their completion:
	


31 December 2012 – Discharged after two weeks for non-compliance with program.

24 February 2013 – Discharged after two weeks for using synthetic cannabis.

19 July 2013 – Self discharged after three months.

Given the applicant’s history, it is not surprising that Ms Taylor recommended the completion of a custodial drug and alcohol program as her first choice of treatment.


	
	The applicant’s history of non-compliance with rehabilitation programs was taken into account by her Honour and undermined his submission that there was a real chance of him being successfully rehabilitated if he were given an extended parole period. Her Honour’s finding that a parole period longer than 25% of the total head sentence would not assist the applicant in his rehabilitation involved a proper exercise of her Honour’s discretion and was open on the evidence. It could not be said that a parole period of 13 months was insufficient to meet the applicant’s rehabilitation needs if he genuinely wished to undertake same.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	
	
	The order which I propose is that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2425069,R v Biljuh (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 702,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

Background


	
	Last week I adjourned this trial by jury after the instructions of the first Crown Prosecutor briefed to appear were withdrawn by the DPP. I granted that adjournment so that new counsel could be briefed and prepare the matter. On the same occasion I rejected an application by the Crown for the discharge of the jury.
	
	
	I gave the new counsel who was to be briefed four and a half days, including two weekend days; that being from about midday on Thursday of last week, 28 May 2015, until today, Tuesday 2 June 2015, at 10 am, with the jury to return to us at 11 am. Reference should be made to the judgment that I delivered the following day, Friday 29 May 2015: R v Biljuh [2015] NSWSC 660.
	
	
	Today the Crown Prosecutor has sought a further adjournment on the simple basis that his preparation, whilst already undertaken, will not be optimal if he is called upon to present the Crown case today. He has explained that there are a large number of matters that he wishes to investigate. There are also, it seems, a number of videos that he would like to watch that he has not yet had a chance to watch. As well as that, the original brief, I am told, is approximately 2,000 pages long.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor 's submission was that the matter should be adjourned until next Tuesday 9 June 2015, that being the Tuesday after a long weekend, and that being two days short of two weeks since I adjourned the trial.
	
	
	He also raised for my consideration, as did defence counsel, a separate but related question. That was whether, if such an adjournment were granted, it could be that the jury should, in truth, be discharged, simply because such a long gap in the presentation of evidence could markedly detract from jury comprehension and commitment to their task, and could also lead to irremediable distraction.
	
	
	Mr Dennis, who appears for the accused, adopted the primary position that the trial should proceed. That was on the basis that it is never optimal for a barrister to have to “pick up” a matter halfway through, and yet that is simply the inevitable consequence of one barrister's instructions being withdrawn and another barrister being briefed.
	
	
	His “fall-back position” was that, if there were to be a further adjournment, it should not go beyond Thursday of this week, otherwise the jury could be irremediably distracted.
	
	
	In discussion between Bench and Bar Table, the Crown Prosecutor, without abandoning his original application, indicated that Thursday at 10 am would be a day that he could “live with”, if I may use the vernacular.
	


Determination


	
	Speaking generally about the application, I accept that the Crown Prosecutor now briefed may not be able to engage in preparation that is absolutely optimal. To my mind, that is indeed the inevitable consequence whenever there is a change of counsel in litigation.
	
	
	I think that a further adjournment of two more days is appropriate, in light of the specific matters that the Crown Prosecutor has explained to me, now that he himself has had a chance to look at and consider the brief personally.
	
	
	But I respectfully do not think that any adjournment can go beyond that time. That is for fear that, if it were to do so, the jury would simply lose commitment to the trial. As well as that, I think the jury would simply have an objective difficulty in recalling the evidence, including cross-examination, that was given approaching one week ago.
	
	
	I indicated in discussions with the Crown Prosecutor that this adjournment should not be regarded by him or his solicitor as a contingent one that can be the subject of yet further application. I also indicated to him that, unless something truly exceptional were to occur, my expectation is that the Crown will be in a position to call its first witness promptly at 10 am on Thursday.
	
	
	Finally, if there is to be any application of that nature, it should be placed before me no later than 3 pm on Wednesday 3 June 2015, unless it is said to be something that occurs between 3 pm Wednesday and 10 am Thursday.
	
	
	It is for those reasons that, when the jury re-joins us at 11 am, I shall invite them to leave us and re-join us at 10 am in two days' time, on Thursday 4 June 2015.

2425098,Application by Alarn Scott McCormick pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2015] NSWSC 708,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Alarn Scott McCormick (the applicant) applies under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (the Act) for an inquiry into his convictions after a trial by jury of one count of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and two counts of doing an act to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	In respect of the first count the applicant relies on four statements of Vanessa Evans dated 14 November 2003, 12 January 2004, 17 March 2006 and 28 March 2006.
	
	
	In respect of the second and third counts the applicant relies on what he contended was the diminished credibility of Leanne Ormiston, on whose evidence the Crown case depended.
	


Applicable law


	
	Part 7 of the Act relevantly provides:
	


""78 Applications to Supreme Court

(1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.

…

79 Consideration of applications

(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a) it appears that the matter:

(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special

facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of

further action.

...

(4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application...""


	
	The principles applicable to the consideration of applications under s 79 were reviewed by Johnson J in Application of Peter James Holland under s.78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review Act) 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251:
	


""[6] The test is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s.79(2). With respect to repealed s.475 Crimes Act 1900 (which used similar words), it was said that this view may be formed where the material causes the person considering the matter unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand: Varley v Attorney General (NSW) at 48; Application of Rendell (1987) 32 A Crim R 243 at 245. This formula has been applied since the repeal of s.475 and its replacement by the provisions now contained in s.79(2): Application of Pedrana (2000) 117 A Crim R 45 at 463 [28]; Application of Suey [2001] NSWSC 543 at [18].

[7] Where it is contended that a doubt or question exists concerning part of the evidence in the case, it is appropriate to consider whether any doubt or question about that part of the evidence produces a doubt or question as to guilt: Application of Moore [2000] NSWSC 364; 112 A Crim R 331 at 332 [6]. The section is to apply to a part of the evidence which has some real material substance as effecting the conclusion of guilt: Application of Suey at [19].

[8] There has to be available material which, as a matter of practical reality, gives rise to a relevant sense of unease or disquiet: Application of Esposito (Hunt J, 14 July 1988, unreported at page 2); Application of Visser (Newman J, 27 June 1994, BC9402667 at page 3); Application of Dunn [2005] NSWSC 857 at [9].

[9]The procedure under s.78 is not intended to provide a convicted

person with yet another avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have

been exhausted: Application of Dunn at [9]; Application of Milat [2005]

NSWSC 920; 157 A Crim R 565 at 574 [26]. Nor is it an

opportunity, in a sense, to run the trial again on paper, with the

ultimate submission that acquittal should result.""

Factual background

Count 1: sexual intercourse without consent


	
	The Crown case was that on 5 June 2003 the applicant had sexual intercourse with Cassie Kennedy without her consent at his home at Bradbury. Ms Kennedy, who had a mild learning disability, had been staying with the applicant for the preceding three days. According to Ms Kennedy, the applicant pulled her to the floor by the hair, asked her to suck his penis, pulled her onto the bed, put his penis inside her and asked if he could ejaculate in her mouth or on her stomach.
	
	
	There was an issue in the trial about how long they were alone together at the applicant’s house. The Crown case was that they were alone from 2pm until 4.30pm. The applicant’s case was that he and Ms Kennedy were alone for only about five minutes before Ms Evans, the applicant’s girlfriend, arrived.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested and interviewed on 24 June 2003.
	


Counts 2 and 3: attempting to pervert the course of justice


	
	It was the Crown case that on 2 July 2003 the applicant called a friend, Ms Ormiston, and told her of Ms Kennedy’s allegations. He asked Ms Ormiston to say that she was with him all day on 5 June 2003 (Count 2). She refused. The Crown alleged that he reiterated the request on 17 July 2003, explaining that it would make it easier for him in court (Count 3). Again she refused, as a result of which the applicant made threats against her and her family.
	


The basis for the application

The application in respect of Count 1


	
	The applicant alleged that “significant fresh evidence” has come to light that raises a doubt about the credibility of Ms Evans. He said:
	


“My Ex-partner gained permission to still live with me during the trail [sic] despite being a Crown Witness in the trial due to her being pregnant with our child. This can be seen as a motive to lie in her statements to the court, as she gained Fully Custody of My daughter after I was imprisoned. On the 14th of November 2003, 12th January, 17th and 28th of March 2006 different statements all of which were sent into me by her, via the mail during my incarceration, each of these statements have varying stories as to her part of the case.

Within these statements that my Ex-partner sent into me she has stated that her and her mother were ‘disallowed’ by the Police to put evidence forward to prove my innocence at my trial and that the police harassed her mother into making statements while not being well enough in her health to make clear and accurate statements as well as stating that I wasn’t read my rights when I was arrested and that evidence was ‘Omitted’ by the Police in regards to her evidence that she gave them.”


	
	In order to assess the application in respect of Count 1 it is necessary to address the four statements of Ms Evans relied upon as constituting grounds to make an order under s 79(1).
	


The first statement of Vanessa Evans dated 14 November 2003


	
	In her statement of 14 November 2003 Ms Evans referred to her statement to police made on 24 June 2003 and said (at [6]):
	


“In paragraph 6 I stated that [sic] could not recall whether my mother had picked me up form [sic] mission employment and returned home or I caught a bus back to Alarn’s house. In conversation with my mother since, my mother definitely recalls that she did not pick me up from the Mission employment office that day. I must have returned to Alarn’s house as I recall having coffee that afternoon with Alarn, Bernie, Cassie and John. To the best of my knowledge I recall having sex with Alarn that afternoon the 5th June 2003 prior to Bernie arriving.”


	
	In her sworn evidence at the trial in June 2004 Ms Evans said that she could not recall whether she had gone to Mission Employment that day. That being so, the passage set out above amounts to no more than speculation as to what occurred, and when, on 5 June 2003.
	
	
	Furthermore, at [8] of the statement of 14 November 2003, she said:
	


“. . my father advised me to have no more to do with the police and we would continue to have the solicitor representing Alarn introduce this statement to the court.”


	
	It is reasonable to infer from that passage that the applicant’s legal representatives had access to the statement of 14 November 2003. The accused’s counsel could have used it to cross-examine her at trial had there been any forensic advantage in so doing.
	


The second statement of Vanessa Evans dated 12 January 2004


	
	In her statement of 12 January 2004, Ms Evans refers to occasions, all of which pre-dated the trial, on which Ms Kennedy is said to have approached the applicant. The applicant necessarily knew of these occasions, which could, accordingly, have been put to Ms Kennedy in cross-examination with a view to impugning her credibility. The importance of Ms Evans’ evidence was to establish these occasions, if they were denied by Ms Kennedy. The statement itself, or at least the substance of the events recorded in it, can be taken to have been available to the applicant at the time of the trial.
	


The third statement of Vanessa Evans dated 17 March 2006


	
	In this statement (at [12]) Ms Evans said that when her mother, Valerie Evans, was first interviewed by NSW Police, Mrs Evans made it clear that “she could not verify any details, as she was suffering ill health and had been undergoing radiation treatment for a form of cancer. This had affected her memory and overall functioning.” Ms Evans also said that her mother felt “harassed” by Police to make a statement that would help convict the applicant. According to Ms Evans, her mother said that “even though she did not like Alarn she would not lie for anyone”.
	
	
	Mrs Evans’ evidence at trial was that she was Vanessa’s mother and that Vanessa would usually but not always sleep at her place in June 2003. She recalled collecting Vanessa from the applicant’s place on occasions when Vanessa asked her to, but did not recall dates on which this occurred. In these circumstances the evidence of Mrs Evans was of limited weight. It was neutral in that it did not advance either the Crown or the applicant’s case. There is no basis for inferring that Mrs Evans’ evidence was other than true or that her evidence assisted the Crown to establish the applicant’s guilt.
	


The fourth statement of Vanessa Evans dated 28 March 2006


	
	In her statement dated 28 March 2006 Ms Evans said that, despite repeatedly approaching the Police, she was not permitted to make further statements about the matter and that Detective McGarry omitted these further matters from her original statement. Because Ms Evans gave oral evidence at the trial she had both an opportunity and an obligation to tell the truth as she saw it, irrespective of what was contained in her statements. Because of the constraints imposed by the laws of evidence, the Crown would not, without the consent or acquiescence of the applicant’s counsel, have been permitted to adduce her evidence by leading questions. Accordingly, I would not infer that she had given other than truthful evidence at the trial, regardless of whether her statements to Police incorporated all that she told them.
	
	
	I note that the applicant has adopted inconsistent positions with respect to Ms Evans’ evidence. On the one hand, he contended that she could not say what she wanted to say because of the conduct of Police. On the other hand, he argued that she had a motive to lie about him to assist in obtaining a conviction so that she could get sole custody of their daughter. These positions are irreconcilable.
	


Other matters


	
	The applicant has raised other matters in support of his application but I do not propose to address them since they amount to a reiteration of the matters relied on in his case at trial, which included that that there was no forensic evidence to corroborate Ms Kennedy’s allegation that she had been forced to have sex and that her evidence, being uncorroborated, ought not to have been accepted. This aspect of her evidence was covered by a direction by the trial judge which the jury must be taken to have followed: Demirok v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 20 at 22 per Barwick CJ.
	
	
	Another matter raised was the alleged physical impossibility of the act, having regard to his then erectile dysfunction. The applicant relied on a report of Dr McCroary dated 4 June 2004 in which its author described the applicant’s penis. This was relied on as a basis for comparison with the sketch Ms Kennedy made. These were matters which were raised at trial and accordingly do not arise for consideration as part of this application.
	


Conclusion with respect to count 1


	
	In respect of the first count, I do not consider the applicant has raised any doubt or question about his guilt or any mitigating circumstances as to any evidence in the case for the purposes of s 79(2) of the Act. Accordingly, there is no basis for this Court to take action under s 79(1).
	


The application in respect of counts 2 and 3


	
	The applicant contended that there is a doubt or question that arises in relation to Ms Ormiston’s evidence. He said:
	


“Another ground for this appeal against my conviction is the fact that the alleged victim of the 2 counts of Perversion Of The Course of Justice, who was also a crown witness to the Sexual Assault Without Consent of An Adult, was found guilty of False Accusation when a week after I was released from prison, she tried to accuse me of assaulting her and it was found that I was in a parole ordered appointment with my Psychologist and that I was NOT present at the time. She was found GUILTY of False Allegations against myself and the arrest was by the same Detective that arrested me in regards to the charges I am Appealing against, Detective Dean McGarry” (application at [6].”


	
	As I understand this submission it is that Ms Ormiston made a false allegation against the applicant after his trial, as a result of which it can be concluded that her evidence at the trial ought not to have been accepted by the jury. There is no evidence before me to support the applicant’s assertion that Ms Ormiston made a false allegation. However, if she did, the applicant alleged that it was made a week after his release, which was at least three and a half years after his trial. Even if such an allegation had been made and was false this would not retrospectively affect the evidence she gave or her credibility at the trial. Moreover, her evidence at trial was corroborated by telephone records which can be assumed to have been taken into account by the jury in its assessment of whether the Crown had proved counts 2 and 3 beyond reasonable doubt.
	


Conclusion with respect to counts 2 and 3


	
	In respect of the second and third counts, I do not consider the applicant has raised any doubt or question about his guilt or any mitigating circumstances as to any evidence in the case for the purposes of s 79(2) of the Act. Accordingly, there is no basis for this Court to take action under s 79(1).
	


Conclusion


	
	I am not satisfied that any of the facts or circumstances relied upon by the applicant justify the taking of further action under s 79. Accordingly, the application is refused.

		30 June 2015",2015-06-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2425112,McCarry v R [2015] NSWDC 209,"Judgment


	
	I am hearing an appeal by Jonathan McCarry against a sentence for dangerous driving. Mr McCarry pleaded guilty to the charge and on 9 April 2015 his Honour Magistrate McCosker sentenced Mr McCarry to 16 months’ imprisonment. His Honour fixed a non-parole period of 10 months. At the same time, Mr McCarry appealed from four other sentences, all of them for possessing prohibited drugs. He also received gaol sentences for those, but they have expired. He has applied for leave to withdraw those appeals and in due course I will grant it.
	
	
	Returning to the driving offence, it occurred on 13 February 2015. Significantly, that was about two and a half years after he had been convicted of a similar offence. What happened this time is contained in a summary in exhibit A. Police know Jonathan McCarry and so when they saw him on that day turning without giving way or indicating, they followed him. Mr McCarry accelerated away and was driving up to 90 kilometres an hour in a 50 kilometre an hour zone. He was rapidly changing lanes and passing between two vehicles, causing the rear one to brake heavily. Two large garbage trucks were approaching a roundabout and Mr McCarry “swerved back and forth between the two southbound lanes, until sufficient room was created between the two heavy vehicles”. He then “rapidly accelerated through the roundabout”. Police followed him for about 200 metres but then wisely discontinued the pursuit. They knew who he was and where he lived. They watched him turning off a main road and as he did, he “failed to give way for an oncoming vehicle, which required him to brake heavily to avoid a collision.”
	
	
	The police arrested Mr McCarry later that day. He said that he “knew straight away youse were coming for me. I gave it a tickle...I wasn’t looking at my speedo.” Police said that he tried to explain that he was getting away from the police so that they would not check the car for defects, but then police found out that he had just had it returned from the mechanic, and the defects fixed.
	
	
	Mr McCarry was charged with the offence which is contained within section 51B(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Parliament regards it as a very serious crime and in a case such as this, where an offender has committed the same offence within five years, Parliament has fixed a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment to the offence. That demonstrates how serious Parliament regards it as Mr A Baker, who appears for the respondent to the appeal, the Director of Public Prosecutions, pointed out. I have to bear in mind, of course, that the jurisdictional limit of his Honour was two years imprisonment.
	
	
	Mr R Whyte, who appears for Mr McCarry on the appeal, had to deal with two significant issues. One was his client’s criminal record and the other was his client’s prospects for rehabilitation.
	
	
	Mr McCarry has a bad criminal record. As Mr Whyte correctly argued, the record is mostly for domestic violence related offences. That is not to condone such offending, but Mr Whyte’s point is that there are few traffic offences. Of course, there is a prior conviction which was recorded on 4 April 2013 for driving recklessly. Mr McCarry has served a number of prison sentences for domestic violence related offences and drug related offences. Significantly, as Mr Whyte pointed out, for the previous dangerous driving offence he was given an $800 fine.
	
	
	Two observations can be made about Mr McCarry’s record. First, I agree with Mr Baker that although driving offences are very few, Mr McCarry has regularly flouted the law and disobeyed court orders. His offences have been serious enough for him to spend time in gaol. In other words, he is not a person who can claim any leniency because of his previous record and, indeed, is a person the courts have to regard as some threat to the community because of his violence and, in two instances, his driving.
	
	
	The second observation is the one made by Mr Whyte, that when one considers his convictions for driving, they are very few. Significantly, the previous conviction was for the same offence, but he received a fine rather than a gaol term. Mr Whyte argues, and Mr Baker acknowledges, that it is a significant jump from a fine to a prison sentence so far as sentencing options are concerned. On the other hand, as I say, Parliament has fixed a maximum of five years to this crime in cases such as this where there is a repeat offender. Seen in that way, the sentence of 16 months is relatively lenient.
	
	
	An additional factor addressed by Mr Whyte were his client’s prospects for rehabilitation. That emerges because his record shows, and a pre-sentence report confirms, that he has problems with prohibited drugs. In a report prepared for the Magistrate and dated 18 March 2015, the Community Corrections Officer pointed out that Mr McCarry has been having regular contact with a clinical psychologist “however, he was resistant to attending residential rehabilitation which was recommended by his psychologist.” The psychologist “believed the offender’s primary issue was substance abuse, and towards this end, had encouraged him towards attending a residential rehabilitation program.”
	
	
	Mr McCarry frankly acknowledged to the Community Corrections Officer that he is a “slave to my addiction”. It is apparently “difficult for him to avoid the drug scene in the Forster area”. But the officer concluded that Mr McCarry “presented as ambivalent regarding engaging in a residential drug rehabilitation program to address his offending behaviour.” He acknowledged that he was prepared to, but the officer observed that “this appeared to be primarily as an alternative to custody.” Apparently he mentioned Benelong’s Haven “however, he has not initiated contact to date.” The officer made contact with that facility and found out that “the assessment process would take approximately two weeks and at present there are no vacancies in the program.”
	
	
	It is obvious, as the officer reported, that “substance abuse issues have had a significant impact on Mr McCarry’s lifestyle and offending behaviour.” Keeping away from prohibited drugs “will be critical if he is to avoid future offending behaviour.” Despite seeing the psychologist for something like two years, he “failed to engage with alcohol and other drug services.”
	
	
	The driving was dangerous. In doing what he did, Mr McCarry flouted the law yet again and put other road users at risk. I do not accept that he showed any contrition, although he was prepared to acknowledge his offending. He had little choice because the police knew who he was and where he lived. However, Mr Whyte does have a point about the gap between an $800 fine and a prison sentence of almost one and a half years.
	
	
	I would be prepared to reduce the sentence to one of 12 months and to fix a non-parole period of six months. However, it would be a condition of the parole that Mr McCarry is admitted immediately to a residential rehabilitation centre and complies with that centre’s directions.
	
	
	Accordingly, the formal orders which I make are these -
	



	
	I grant leave to the appellant to withdraw his appeals in respect of counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 in exhibit A.
	
	
	Under section 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I determine this appeal against sentence by varying the sentence. Instead of the sentence of 16 months imprisonment, I fix a sentence of 12 months imprisonment to date from 13 February 2015 and to expire on 12 February 2016. I fix a non-parole period of six months to commence on 13 February 2015 and to expire on 12 August 2015.
	
	
	Under section 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I make an order directing Mr McCarry’s release on parole on 13 August 2015. The conditions of his parole are these:
	



	
	that he be of good behaviour;
	
	
	that he attends court if he receives a notice to do so;
	
	
	(iii)    that he proceeds from custody immediately to a residential rehabilitation centre and complies with all reasonable recommendations and directions of staff of such a centre for the balance of his parole.
	


BAKER: Your Honour, might I just interrupt, I apologise. Just logistically, the Crown is concerned with an order that he immediately go to a residential rehabilitation centre if a bed is not available. We don’t want him breaching just simply because that hasn’t been put into place.

HIS HONOUR: Well, I don’t want him in the community.

BAKER: Perhaps if it’s a condition of his parole that he accept orders of Probation and Parole that, and one of those directions may be that he attend a residential rehabilitation centre.

HIS HONOUR: Or that he be released on parole only if there is a bed available. Can I do that?

BAKER: No, it’s under three years, so your Honour sets a non-parole period, and he is released to parole on that day. So I think to best achieve your Honour’s goal, without a report here saying a bed is available, and we’re about two months away from his release date, your Honour can make it a condition of his parole that he accepted all reasonable directions of the Probation and Parole office, particularly in regard to attendance to a residential rehabilitation program, and perhaps if your Honour marks the papers so the Probation and Parole office knows that the intention was that he attend a program. I just don’t think, without a bed being set aside for him, that on that day he is released to parole, it be ordered that he attend there, because the way these things are, it takes weeks from initial contact.

HIS HONOUR: I can see your point. I can see your point. But what troubles me, Mr Baker, is that, as I said, he has expressed some ambivalence about going into rehabilitation, but Mr Whyte says he has instructions that he is prepared to go into rehabilitation. I want him not to have any option. The pre‑sentence report acknowledged that it is really the compulsion of it, the alternative to custody, which is driving him. I would be prepared to revise my orders and list the matter, I think I am sitting in Parramatta in August, and bring him back before me on a section 11 and find out that he has got a bed, and give the orders accordingly. Mr Whyte, Mr Baker, I will hear you both on that.

WHYTE: I’m with your Honour on that.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

BAKER: The other alternative may be, with delicate wording, your Honour can order attendance of a residential rehabilitation program when one is available, and logistically I don’t think the Parole Office is going to breach him if he is making all the attempts to get in.

HIS HONOUR: Look, you are right, but there is too much flexibility there.

Mr McCarry, just to explain to you what is happening, you have heard what I have been saying, haven’t you? Can you hear me?

APPELLANT: Yes I can.

HIS HONOUR: I am prepared to reduce your sentence from 16 to 12 months and to give you a non-parole period of six months, which will expire in August, do you understand that?

APPELLANT: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: But I want you to go straight into rehab and sort your life out, so that you are not a threat to the community any more either because of domestic violence or driving; that’s the best way of, I think, protecting the community, and also, hopefully, you getting your life back in order and not commit any more crimes. Do you understand that?

APPELLANT: Yeah.

HIS HONOUR: So for that reason, I want it to be compulsory for you to go from gaol into rehab without any choice and without any time in the community. Do you understand that?

APPELLANT: Yeah.

HIS HONOUR: All right. So what I am going to do is - so the parole will expire, or was to expire 13 August. I am thinking of Friday 7 August, and before me at Parramatta. All right, I am going to return to my reasons and revise my orders in light of Mr Baker and Mr Whyte’s submissions.


	
	I no longer regard it as appropriate to finally determine this appeal today. That is because, as Mr Baker pointed out, my proposed order may not work as a matter of logistics. On the other hand, I think it is important for the protection of the community and for increasing Mr McCarry’s prospects of rehabilitation that he proceed directly from gaol into a residential rehabilitation centre. We do not have information at this point of time about the availability of a bed in a rehabilitation centre. I am therefore prepared to adjourn the case to a date in August so that I can be informed about the availability of a bed. Hopefully it will be confirmed and I can finalise the case by fixing the sentence and the non‑parole period, and making it a condition that he proceed, on release on parole, straight to that bed in that facility.
	
	
	So the formal orders which I make today are these.
	



	
	I grant leave to the appellant to withdraw his appeals in respect of counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 in exhibit A.
	
	
	I note that his Honour reduced the period of disqualification to 12 months. I am informed that the minimum available at the Court’s discretion is two years, and I direct that the disqualification period be reduced to two years.
	
	
	I adjourn these proceedings to Friday 7 August 2015 before me at Parramatta at 10am.
	
	
	I direct that a transcript of my judgment be taken out and made available to me and the parties on or before Monday 3 August 2015.

		23 September 2015",2015-06-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2425404,Marsh v R [2015] NSWCCA 154,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON JA: I have read in draft the judgment of Harrison J. Having considered all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the appellant was rightly convicted. I also agree that the sentence of imprisonment for life was one that was open to the sentencing judge. I accordingly agree with the orders proposed.
	
	
	HARRISON J: The appellant was indicted upon a single count that on 27 April 2010 at Chatswood he did murder Michelle Beets. He was convicted of her murder on 14 November 2011 following a trial before Price J and a jury. The appellant was sentenced by Price J to imprisonment for life on 9 March 2012. The appellant appeals to this Court against his conviction and against the severity of his sentence.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal against conviction are as follows:
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred in admitting evidence that the appellant had undertaken training in the use of knives while serving in the United States Marine Corps in the late 1970s. The evidence was inadmissible because:


	
	it was irrelevant to the proceedings and hence ought to have been excluded under s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995;
	
	
	alternatively, it invited the jury to engage in coincidence reasoning and hence ought to have been excluded under ss 98 and/or 101 of the Act; or
	
	
	any probative value in the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice that it posed to the appellant and therefore ought to have been excluded under s 137 or possibly s 135 of the Act.
	


As a result of (i) to (iii) inclusive, the verdict is unreasonable and the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is inapplicable.

Ground 2: The verdict is unreasonable and is not supported by the evidence.

Ground 3: Irrespective of the precise basis or bases upon which the evidence is inadmissible, the degree of unfair prejudice posed to the appellant by the admission of the evidence renders the proviso inapplicable.


	
	The Crown case at trial was as follows. The appellant is a citizen of the United States. He served in the US Marine Corps between 1978 and 1984. He was previously married and they have a daughter. The appellant trained as a nurse in the United States. He was divorced in 1996 and was required to pay child support for his daughter.
	
	
	The appellant met Samantha Marsh in Vietnam in 2007. He arrived in Australia in December 2008 on a 457 visa. Samantha Marsh came on a student visa. They were married in December 2008 and lived with Ms Marsh’s brother from August 2009.
	
	
	The deceased was a Nurse Unit Manager in the Emergency Department of the Royal North Shore Hospital. She interviewed the appellant for a nursing position at the hospital and he commenced work there in February 2009. The appellant worked in that job under the deceased’s supervision for 12 months. However, by January 2010 the hospital determined not to renew his contract of employment. He was told of this by the deceased.
	
	
	Without a job in Australia the appellant became exposed to the possibility of deportation in accordance with the conditions of his visa. He made 19 unsuccessful applications for employment in the period before 27 April 2010. The appellant had by then also incurred a debt for unpaid child support payments totalling USD 50,000. By reason of that debt, the appellant was unable to renew his United States passport which precluded his return to that country. He did not wish to return to Vietnam.
	
	
	The appellant formed the opinion that the deceased had adversely affected his prospects of securing employment in Australia by providing him with poor references. That belief was to some extent accurate. The appellant was also angry with the deceased for other reasons that predated the termination of his employment.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that in these circumstances the appellant planned to murder the deceased. Her address was listed in the phone book. He began to monitor her house from late March or early April 2010. He rode his bicycle to her house. He left messages for her on her answer machine.
	
	
	The appellant owned a Ka Bar knife and a flick knife. His wife observed him operating the flick knife. He practised “killing” his wife and her brother by simulating attacks upon them from behind. This consisted of grabbing their faces from behind and cutting their throats, combined with a stabbing to the chest if necessary. The appellant purchased various items of clothing from St Vincent de Paul at Chatswood. He murdered the deceased at her house in Chatswood on 27 April 2010.
	
	
	It was also a significant part of the Crown case that the appellant had confessed to his wife that he had killed the deceased and importantly that in doing so he had given her details concerning the circumstances of her death that could only have been known to the person who killed her. The Crown also adduced evidence of six separate circumstances as follows:
	



	
	Video footage of the appellant in the vicinity of the incident approximately 15 minutes after the death of the deceased.
	
	
	The appellant’s disposal of a bum bag and various items of clothing at the location at which he was filmed shortly after the incident.
	
	
	Evidence of the appellant’s motive to kill the deceased.
	
	
	Police listening device evidence of the appellant reporting a story to a group of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints that the Crown contended was false and intended to divert police attention, to the effect that the appellant had come to an arrangement with a certain organisation that he would be falsely implicated in the death of the deceased and a large amount of money would be paid to his wife in exchange for him serving time in gaol.
	
	
	The alleged similarities between the method of attack used to kill the deceased and the simulated attacks upon his wife and her brother, and a knife attack method taught to members of the United States Marine Corps at a particular time when the appellant had been a member.
	
	
	The appellant’s enquiries at Flight Centre on 19 May 2010 concerning the purchase of a one way ticket to Los Angeles.
	


Rulings of evidence


	
	On 7 September 2011 his Honour made two pre-trial evidentiary rulings. The first ruling excluded evidence of what was alleged to be the appellant’s plan to kill his former wife. The second related to evidence of the appellant’s alleged motive to kill the deceased. His Honour admitted that evidence over objection based upon s 137 of the Evidence Act. The evidence of motive was a combination of the following four factors:
	



	
	The appellant’s employment at the Royal North Shore Hospital was soon to expire.
	
	
	His visa might have been revoked if he failed to gain alternative employment.
	
	
	He was having difficulty obtaining employment on account of what he believed to be the deceased providing unfavourable references to prospective employers.
	
	
	He would not be able to return to the United States if he were forced to leave Australia.
	



	
	On 8 September 2011 his Honour made an additional pre-trial evidentiary ruling. He admitted evidence over objection that the appellant was a former marine and in that capacity had received a particular form of knife training. The evidence included a video demonstration of the knife attack method said to have been taught to the appellant. It also included the opinion offered by a forensic pathologist that the attack method demonstrated in the video would in general produce injuries similar to those sustained by the deceased.
	
	
	Counsel for the appellant at the trial objected to this evidence upon the basis that:
	



	
	it did not establish that knife training was in fact given to the appellant;
	
	
	it was unfairly prejudicial to him;
	
	
	it was impossible for the pathologist to express her opinions without having first watched the recording.
	



	
	The Crown relied upon this evidence at the trial in support of a circumstantial case identifying the person responsible for the death of the deceased and also as evidence that the appellant had lied to the police when he told them that he had not had any training in knife attack methods. His Honour concluded prior to the trial that the evidence showed:
	



	
	The appellant served in the United States Marine Corps between November 1978 and November 1984.
	
	
	As a marine he would have received basic training including how to attack someone from behind as depicted in the video. That method consisted essentially of approaching a victim from behind, covering the victim’s mouth, hyper-extending the body, throwing the victim off balance and cutting across the neck with the object of severing the carotid artery. Any obstruction or interference posed by the victim’s hands is met by repeatedly plunging the knife into the victim’s body.
	
	
	The deceased died as the result of incised wounds to the neck and stab wounds to the chest.
	
	
	Based on the forensic pathologist’s evidence, the knife attack method would produce injuries similar to those observed on the deceased.
	
	
	The knife attack method may also have included refresher training.
	



	
	The appellant neither gave evidence at his trial nor called any witnesses. His case was that he did not kill the deceased or otherwise harm her and that he was completely uninvolved in her death. It was also his case that he did not go to the deceased’s premises on the day that she died.
	


CONVICTION


	
	The appellant contended that the evidence of his service as a marine, the training he had received and the video evidence depicting the staged infliction of a fatal wound was all inadmissible as irrelevant and should have been excluded either under s 55 of the Act, or because it invited the jury to engage in coincidence reasoning and ought to have been excluded under s 98 and/or s 101 of the Act, or because it fell foul of s 135 or s 137 of the Act.
	


The evidence


	
	Evidence of the appellant’s service as a marine was led at the trial from three witnesses.
	


Kelly Murphy


	
	Ms Murphy was qualified to give evidence about the appellant’s United States military history. He enlisted as a marine in 1978 and left in 1982 with a short service break in November 1981. He completed recruit training at an unspecified date, infantry training in 1979 and attended Marine Security School in 1982. He also served as a Marine Security Guard at United States embassies in Argentina and China.
	


Carl Tyler


	
	Mr Tyler served as a marine between 1982 and 2006. At the time of the trial he was employed to develop training curricula for the United States Defence Department. He gave evidence from his personal experience of post-1982 knife training but could only give evidence of pre-1982 knife training upon the basis of what others had told him. He had no personal knowledge of knife training in the Marine Corps prior to 1982 and no knowledge of what marines were trained in at boot camp at Parris Island in 1978.
	


Charles Archuleta


	
	Mr Archuleta joined the Marines in 1976 and served as a combat photographer from 1979 until 1996. He said that following graduation as a Marine, graduates received additional combat training including the use of knives. For the trial Mr Archuleta produced a training manual relating to the use of knives. He said the manual was applicable in 1978. However, his work in the Marines did not encompass weapons training. He was never stationed at Parris Island.
	
	
	Mr Archuleta agreed that the 1957 manual, as modified and applicable in 1978, specified a single method for the infliction of death by knife wounding commencing with an approach from behind. That method essentially involved placing the hand over the victim’s mouth and face and plunging a knife into the victim’s back above the belt. The manual therefore described one method of attack and it was not the method described by Mr Tyler.
	
	
	Mr Archuleta was re-examined as follows:
	


“Crown: Are you aware if there were any other publications that were in use in the Marine Corps in the 70s and 80s in relation to hand-to-hand combat?

Archuleta: There always has to be an active Marine Corps order that regulates training to recruits. I just do not have one particularly in our archives covering that time period, but there is always an active recall order that regulates training for recruits that go on on a daily basis.

Crown Prosecutor: Is all of that training in hand-to-hand combat within this book?

Archuleta: That publication we saw in 1957, that would show the training during that time period. Modern day Marine Corps training from 1976, 1978 and onwards, there’s always some sort of hand-to-hand combat taught to recruits during basic training.

Crown Prosecutor: Did that include material that was in this book?

Archuleta: Yes, sir. It does. Some of the defensive moves, the knife attacks, the bayonet training; they’re all similar.”


	
	The appellant submitted that Mr Archuleta’s remarks did not include an affirmative response to the question whether there might exist additional published Marine Corps training material setting out one or more methods for attacking a victim from behind with a knife (that is, aside from the method contained in the 1957 manual). Mr Archuleta’s remark “[t]here always has to be an active Marine Corps order that regulates training to recruits. I just do not have one particularly in our archives”, taken either in isolation or in the context of the surrounding exchange, does not necessarily amount to a suggestion that there are in fact, or that there were in the past, any other publication(s) containing additional methods for attacking a victim from behind with a knife.
	
	
	Mr Archuleta was subsequently recalled to give evidence. After viewing the video containing the Tyler demonstration, Mr Archuleta affirmed that he was in fact taught that technique “with just a little bit of a variation” in 1976. The variation was to the effect that the attacker would omit the placing of his knee into the victim’s back. He affirmed on the basis of personal knowledge (derived from observations made at various west coast training locations) that other recruits were taught that method (minus the knee aspect) post-1976, at least until 1986.
	
	
	In response to a request from the Crown that he (Mr Archuleta) indicate the basis for his knowledge as to what was taught on the east coast, including at Parris Island, in 1978, Mr Archuleta responded:
	


“The Command Museum, which I presently work at, comes under the guidance of G3, which is the higher headquarters element for operations and training. The G3 at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, and the G3 at the Marine Corps recruit Depot, Parris Island, use the same training manuals, the same Marine Corps order.”


	
	Mr Archuleta agreed that individual instructors could vary the training. Only specific aspects of basic training were taught generally and those aspects were set out in the manual. In addition, the instructors could add their own elaborations to the basic training. The appellant emphasised that the bases for Mr Archuleta’s knowledge as to the contents of training at Parris Island were (i) the commonality of the training manuals, that is, the use at Parris Island of training manual(s) that did not contain the attack method as demonstrated in the video by Mr Tyler and (ii) the issuing of a common Marine Corps Order, that is, an Order written at Quantico, Virginia, and disseminated to both east coast and west coast training facilities. There was no evidence as to the contents of such an order.
	


Price J’s judgment


	
	His Honour considered that the video and the surrounding evidence had substantial probative value and that it did not create unfair prejudice to the appellant: [2011] NSWSC 1686. His Honour admitted the evidence and commented as follows at [8] and [9]:
	


“[8] By viewing the evidence of Kelly Murphy, Carl Tyler and Charles Archuleta, in combination with the representations made to police by [the appellant’s brother in law] and Mrs Marsh, a jury could capably conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, whilst in the USMC, received knife training and that training included the killing of a sentry from behind by the use of a knife as demonstrated in the video by Mr Tyler.

[9] When this evidence is considered by a jury, together with the evidence of Dr Irvine and the evidence of motive, which was the subject of my judgment yesterday, a jury could capably conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference is that it was the accused who inflicted the wounds upon the deceased which caused her death.”


	
	During the course of the trial itself his Honour considered withdrawing the video recording as an exhibit on the basis that there was no evidence that the attack method was taught to Marines at the relevant time. However, his Honour did not do so and said this:
	


“I was contemplating withdrawing from the jury the demonstration video…[but did not do so]…I was fortified in that view from Mr Archuleta’s evidence that, having looked at the demonstration video, the technique was used in 1976 in his enlistment training…”


	
	His Honour later continued:
	


“A fact in issue in the trial is whether the accused was trained in the technique of an attack from behind similar to that demonstrated in the video…”


	
	Counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial applied for a discharge of the jury on the basis that the evidence was not satisfactory and did not support the proposition that the appellant had undergone the relevant kind of knife training. He asserted that the material was prejudicial and incapable of cure by direction. He also emphasised the dissimilarity between training received by the appellant and that depicted in the video. However, the jury was not discharged and was not directed to disregard the video. It was admitted on the basis that:
	



	
	The supposed similarity between the technique illustrated in the video and the technique that the appellant’s brother-in-law said the appellant practised on him using a spoon;
	
	
	Evidence from Ms Kelly Dee that the appellant had said that he knew how to inflict death by slitting someone’s throat.
	



	
	His Honour admitted the evidence after consideration of the issue of relevance for the purposes of the Evidence Act but without consideration at that stage of any other evidentiary issues. He later indicated that he had considered the impact of s 137 when admitting the video evidence even though he did not at the time refer to that section.
	


Appellant’s arguments


	
	The appellant contended generally that whether or not he received a particular type of knife training in the United States Marine Corps was not a fact in issue in the trial. The primary fact in issue was whether or not the appellant caused the death of the deceased and, if he did not, who did. The appellant accepted that it did not necessarily follow that any training he might have received was not capable of rationally affecting the assessment of that primary fact, and hence was not necessarily irrelevant for the purposes of s 55 of the Act. However, he submitted in this case that the proper conclusion should have been, on an examination of the material in evidence, that the knife training was in fact irrelevant for s 55 purposes.
	


Ground 1(i)


	
	The appellant contended that in adducing evidence of knife-related training allegedly received by him as a member of the USMC, the Crown invited the jury to accept the following reasoning:
	



	
	The deceased died from knife wounds to the neck and chest.
	
	
	The wounds were inflicted in a particular way.
	
	
	When the appellant served in the USMC, marines were taught a knife attack method similar to that used upon the deceased.
	
	
	The technique demonstrated by the appellant to his wife and her brother was that technique.
	
	
	Therefore the appellant is likely to be the killer of the deceased, especially in combination with the other evidence against him.
	



	
	The appellant submitted that the knife attack evidence possessed insufficient probative force for s 55 purposes. That was said to be because of the following factors:
	



	
	It was doubtful that the appellant was in fact taught the relevant knife attack method concerned. The technique depicted and recreated in the video was not part of the official 1978 training manual when the appellant received his basic training. Mr Tyler did not establish that the method in question was in fact taught at Parris Island in 1978.
	
	
	Mr Archuleta initially confirmed that the relevant training manual only specified a method of attack in which the assailant inserts a knife into the victim’s back above the belt. He also confirmed that this was the only method taught to recruits as a general practice. It was only after viewing the video that Mr Archuleta said that he had been taught a modified version of that method and that he saw others taught that same method up until at least 1986.
	
	
	The relevant knife attack method does not entail a high degree of specificity sufficient to lend weight to the suggestion that it would be difficult to perform by someone other than a current or former United States Marine.
	
	
	Ms Kelly did no more than set out the contents of the appellant’s military record.
	



	
	The appellant submitted that a finding of relevance would require the Court to accept that the appellant was taught the relevant method and that the teaching relevantly bears upon the assessment of a fact or facts in issue. The appellant contended that the prosecution reasoning in this respect was tenuous because it is neither clear that the appellant was in fact taught the relevant knife attack method nor that it was deployed in the death of the deceased.
	
	
	The appellant argued further that even accepting that there was a requisite degree of probative force in the knife attack evidence apart from the Tyler video, the same conclusion cannot be accepted with respect to the video itself. The video provided the jury with no information that they did not otherwise have from the oral evidence about knife attacks and instructions in the applicable technique.
	
	
	The appellant contrasted the position with Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59; (2007) 235 CLR 521. Here the evidence of knife training was not capable of intersecting with other evidence in the trial so as to enhance the jury’s capacity rationally to arrive at a finding about a primary fact in issue. The relevance of the in-court display evidence in Evans, in which the accused wore a balaclava and overalls and walked in front of the jury wearing these items, arose out of the comparison between the display and the descriptions given by witnesses, as well as CCTV footage. In that case there were degrees of certainty among all three ways in which the evidence was presented. In the present case, the appellant argued that the evidence does not support a conclusion that he was taught the knife attack method depicted or described, or that the deceased died as a result of the use of that method. Accordingly, the knife attack evidence rose no higher than an invitation to utilise coincidence reasoning.
	


The Crown’s response


	
	The Crown pointed to the following evidence in the trial in addition to that specifically referred to by the appellant.
	
	
	Dr Irvine examined the deceased at the scene of the murder at about 5:40 am on 28 April 2010. She noted that her neck had been cut through including the larynx and the carotid arteries. There was a “complete transection of all of the soft tissues in the neck that would normally be in front of the vertebral column”. She noted multiple cuts to the deceased's neck and a cluster of eight stab wounds on the upper left chest. There was a single stab wound in the central lower chest which went through the skin and cartilage and entered the pericardium and incised the right side of the heart. There was a total of 17 incised wounds on the deceased's hands which Dr Irvine categorised as defence wounds. There were some superficial cuts to the deceased's face, a bruise to her lip and a shallow wound near her collar bone.
	
	
	Dr Irvine was of the view that the knife used to inflict these wounds had a single bladed edge without serrations. Dr Irvine had viewed the Tyler video and was of the view that the technique used in general would produce a distribution and type of injuries similar to what she observed on the deceased.
	
	
	Kelly Dee worked at the Royal North Shore Hospital with the appellant and spoke with him in the tea room about ten months after he had started working there. She gave evidence that the appellant told her that “he knew how to kill people and he said that he knew how to slit someone's throat so that they wouldn't survive”.
	
	
	In argument before Price J on the admissibility of the video, the Crown submitted that it wanted to rely on it as part of a circumstantial case to identify the deceased’s killer that included evidence of the appellant practising on Samantha Marsh and her brother, his knowledge of how to do an effective knife attack and the manner of the death of the deceased.
	
	
	In general response to the appellant’s submissions on this ground of appeal, the Crown contended that they failed to recognise the difference between relevance and probative value. These concepts are distinctly different for the purposes of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	For the purposes of s 55 of the Act, a fact in issue is any matter that must ultimately be determined by the jury in order to decide whether the accused has committed the offence charged: R v Cornwell [2003] NSWSC 660. The focus of s 55 is on the capability of the evidence to affect the determinations or conclusions of the tribunal of fact: R v Burton [2013] NSWCCA 335.
	


Consideration


	
	In Adam v The Queen [2001] HCA 57; (2001) 207 CLR 96, Gaudron J at [59] – [60] said:
	


“[59] The dictionary to the Act defines ‘probative value’ to mean ‘the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue’. That definition echoes the substance of s 55(1) of the Act which provides that ‘evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding’. It is to be noted that the dictionary definition differs from s 55 in that it is not predicated on the assumption that the evidence will be accepted.

[60] The omission from the dictionary definition of ‘probative value’ of the assumption that the evidence will be accepted is, in my opinion, of no significance. As a practical matter, evidence can rationally affect the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue only if it is accepted. Accordingly, the assumption that it will be accepted must be read into the dictionary definition.”


	
	In DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; (2012) 215 A Crim R 349, Whealy JA (with whom Bathurst CJ, Allsop P, McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum J agreed) said:
	


[50] An important cornerstone in the structure of the Evidence Act 1995 is s 55. This deals with the topic of relevant evidence. The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings.

[51] Another key section is s 56(1) which provides that, except as otherwise provided by this Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in a proceeding. Subsection (2) provides that evidence that is not relevant in the proceeding is not admissible.

[52] I have earlier set out the definition of probative value - the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue.

[53] As is recognised and stated by the High Court in Smith v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 650, the first question to be asked when an issue of the present kind arises is whether the evidence is relevant. In the present matter, that the evidence is relevant would hardly be thought to be a matter of contention. However, Mr Odgers SC has queried in his submissions this primary matter. As Gleeson CJ observed in Smith v The Queen, although questions of relevance may raise ‘nice questions of judgment’, no discretion falls to be exercised. Evidence is either relevant or it is not. If the evidence is not relevant, no further question arises about its admissibility. The simple fact is that irrelevant material may not be received. This is a proposition that is fundamental to the law of evidence and well settled.

[54] In determining the basic issue of relevance in a criminal trial, it is especially important to identify the ultimate issues. These will ordinarily be expressed in terms of the element of the offence with which the accused stands charged in light of the defence, if known. However, behind these ultimate issues, there will often be many issues about facts that are relevant to facts in issue (Smith v The Queen at 654; Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 307: especially at 312 and 321-322).”


	
	In Smith v The Queen Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said:
	


“[7] In determining relevance, it is fundamentally important to identify what are the issues at the trial. On a criminal trial the ultimate issues will be expressed in terms of the elements of the offence with which the accused stands charged. They will, therefore, be issues about the facts which constitute those elements. Behind those ultimate issues there will often be many issues about facts relevant to facts in issue. In proceedings in which the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) applies, as it did here, the question of relevance must be answered by applying Pt 3.1 of the Act and s 55 in particular. Thus, the question is whether the evidence, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment by the tribunal of fact, here the jury, of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.”


	
	In Adam, Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby and Hayne JJ said at [22]:
	


“[22] Contrary to the appellant's contention, deciding whether the evidence was relevant neither required nor permitted the trial judge to make some assessment of whether the jury would or might accept it. Section 55(1), with its reference to ‘if it [the evidence in question] were accepted’, requires that relevance be determined on the assumption that the tribunal of fact accepts the evidence. Relevance is demonstrated if, were the evidence to be accepted, it could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.”


	
	The “fact in issue” in the present case, the existence of which the challenged evidence is said to be rationally capable of affecting, is whether or not the appellant murdered the deceased. Behind that ultimate issue there were many issues about facts that were relevant to this fact in issue, the USMC knife attack training being one.
	
	
	The appellant asserted that there was no evidence that he actually did the training. However, from the combined evidence of Mr Tyler, Mr Archuleta, Ms Murphy and the Tyler video, the inference could clearly be drawn by the jury that the appellant did receive the training.
	
	
	Mr Archuleta’s evidence was critical in closing any potential unfilled gap in the Crown case as to the training undertaken by the appellant. Importantly he was recalled after viewing the video and said the technique as demonstrated was used in 1976 when he was at recruit school. The only difference was that he was not taught to place a knee in the victim's back to put them off balance. He gave further evidence that he had a lengthy period of combat service followed by being a photographer in the Marines during which time he would observe training and interact with his counterparts in recruit school. He observed such training from 1976 until 1986 and the technique as demonstrated in the video was what he observed being taught at that time.
	
	
	It was a part of the Crown's circumstantial case that there was a real connection between the military training received by the appellant on how to undertake an attack on a sentry from behind with a knife, the evidence of Samantha Marsh and her brother that he had practised such a manoeuvre on them in the weeks before the death of the deceased and the similarities of the distribution pattern of the wounds from such an attack to those she sustained.
	
	
	Relevance is necessarily a relative concept. The question of whether or not a particular piece of evidence has relevance can only be determined or assessed in the context of the whole of the evidence tendered in the trial. Clearly enough, in a circumstantial case such as the present, no individual fact could establish the appellant’s guilt. The jury was required in this case to reason in a staged approach from findings that certain basic facts had been established by the evidence, even if these facts were neither proved beyond reasonable doubt nor taken alone were capable of proving the appellant’s guilt, to inferring or concluding from a combination of those established facts that a further fact or facts existed. The ultimate fact the Crown asked the jury to find based upon these facts was that the appellant was guilty of the murder of the deceased.
	
	
	The evidence of the appellant’s military training in general, and his knife attack training in particular, was not standing alone capable of establishing his guilt. In precisely the same way, the separate pieces of evidence from Samantha Marsh and her brother, concerning what amounted to simulated knife attacks from behind, was also not, taken alone, capable of doing so. However, the relevance of each of these pieces of evidence, together with other circumstances proved by the Crown, was capable of doing so. The relevance of the knife attack evidence, as opposed to its probative value, lay in its contextual placement in the whole of the evidence in the trial.
	
	
	In my opinion, the evidence of the military training could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue, namely whether the appellant murdered the deceased. Such a finding was clearly open to his Honour as the jury could properly find a logical connection between the issue of the military training and the manner in which the deceased was killed. The evidence of the military training was relevant under s 55.
	


Ground 1(ii)


	
	The appellant next contended that the evidence was relevant, if at all, only as coincidence evidence. Sections 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act therefore applied. They are as follows:
	


“98 The coincidence rule

(1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

(2)…

101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution 

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

(3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.

(4) This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.”


	
	The appellant submitted that the evidence of the two events that attract the operation of these provisions was the evidence of knife training undertaken by the appellant in the late 1970s as a component of his USMC training and evidence surrounding the death of the deceased. He submitted that the evidence of knife training invited the jury to conclude that it is comparatively unlikely that a person murdered by a technique taught to USMC personnel was not in fact murdered by a current or former USMC member.
	
	
	The Crown did not give notice of its intention to adduce coincidence evidence in accordance with s 98(1) (a). The appellant submitted that the evidence was therefore inadmissible for a coincidence reasoning purpose: R v AN [2000] NSWCCA 372 at [62].
	
	
	The appellant also argued, however, that the evidence lacked significant probative value, as earlier discussed at [35], so that it ought to have been excluded having regard to s 98(1)(b).
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the coincidence reasoning for which the Crown contends in this case is to be distinguished from the coincidence reasoning in issue in R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437. There the court found that for the purposes of the coincidence rule, it was indeed improbable that drugs would be kept on two premises controlled by one accused without the accused’s knowledge, so that the evidence to support one count was admissible to support the other. There was an undisputed factual connection between the accused and each of the two separate premises on which the prohibited substances were discovered. In the present case, by way of contrast, even though the appellant received some form of training in the USMC, there is no undisputed factual connection between the appellant and the incident resulting in the death of the deceased. There is merely a contention that a person who is or was trained as a member of the USMC is a member of a class of persons that was highly likely to include the person responsible for the death of the deceased.
	
	
	The appellant submitted in the alternative that the additional requirement of s 102(2) is attracted. The Crown is entitled to invite coincidence reasoning only where “the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant”. As was considered in R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319 at [94], the court is required to give “consideration to the actual prejudice in the specific case which the probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh.” The appellant contended that the probative value of knife training does not “substantially outweigh” any prejudicial effect it may have on the appellant but that the opposite was in fact the case.
	


The Crown’s response


	
	The Crown did not give notice of an intention to adduce coincidence evidence pursuant to s 98 (1) (a), arguing instead that such notice was unnecessary as the evidence of the military training did not involve coincidence evidence or invite the jury to engage in coincidence type reasoning.
	
	
	The importance of the military knife training lay in the similarity in the pattern of the injuries that the deceased had suffered during the course of the attack upon her, which included multiple very deep lacerations to her neck, cluster stab wounds to her chest and 17 defensive wounds to her hands, and injuries that would be inflicted in the manoeuvre that was taught in the Marines, and the manoeuvre which the appellant practiced on Samantha Marsh and her brother.
	
	
	Dr Irvine, the forensic pathologist, opined that the wounds that she saw on the deceased were consistent with having been inflicted in an attack such as she witnessed in the demonstration by Mr Tyler.
	
	
	The Crown case was never put on the basis that it was comparatively unlikely that a person murdered by way of a technique taught to members of the USMC was not in fact murdered by a current or former member of the Marines, the appellant being a former member. It was never suggested that only a member or former member of the USMC could have committed the offence. Rather this evidence was simply relied upon as one piece of the circumstantial evidence in establishing a case against the appellant.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the coincidence rule is not applicable as there is no evidence “that two or more relevant events occurred…” which would attract the operation of s 98.
	


Consideration


	
	The evidence of the knife attack training in my opinion has nothing to do with coincidence or coincidence reasoning. In order for the appellant’s knife attack training to qualify as coincidence evidence it would be necessary to conclude or to infer that the deceased had in fact been killed by a United States Marine or former marine or, more generally, by someone who had received knife attack training as a member of the USMC. In the case at hand, the evidence does not permit a finding that the deceased was killed by a person with such qualifications. At its highest, the evidence established that the deceased was killed in a vicious and sustained knife attack that was consistent with an attack by a large range of unqualified members of the general population. As far as I can determine, the trial before Price J was never conducted upon the basis that the Crown could, or was attempting to, point to two events that were otherwise unlikely to occur by chance. The cause of death of the deceased or the method of killing her taken at face value did not coincide with USMC knife attack methods or training techniques.
	
	
	The question of unfair prejudice to the appellant does not therefore arise in this context. It is otherwise dealt with in consideration of the following ground of appeal.
	


Ground 1(iii)


	
	The appellant submitted that the evidence poses a danger of unfair prejudice to the extent that it invites the jury to conclude, even if only subconsciously, that a person with a military background is more likely to engage in violent activity than otherwise. Mr Tyler’s video is said to contain a higher form of unfair prejudice as it is of a violent and confronting nature, inviting the jury to dwell upon the manner in which the deceased appears to have died. This is particularly prejudicial as well because establishing the precise manner of death was said to lack a legitimate forensic purpose. The added apparent military authority of the author of the video contributed to this prejudice.
	
	
	The appellant also submitted that the confronting nature of the video would or might have inflamed retributive sentiments in jurors, in turn motivating them to identify a culprit, while also clouding their capacity dispassionately to assess the probative strength of the evidence or its comparative strength. Finally, the appellant contended that there was a danger that the shortcomings in the USMC training evidence might be downplayed or overlooked and that the video evidence might correspondingly although artificially be heightened.
	


The Crown’s response


	
	As noted in R v Burton by Simpson J at [134] and at [182], the correct approach to the interpretation and application of s 137 requires a Court to undertake two separate assessments followed by a judgment involving a balancing exercise. There should be an initial assessment of the probative value of the evidence in question followed by an assessment of the danger of unfair prejudice to an accused that might attend the admission of that evidence. If the result of the decision-making exercise is that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, the court is obliged to exclude the evidence. It has been held that there is a danger of unfair prejudice if there is a real risk that the jury will make improper use of the evidence: R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131.
	
	
	Her Honour went on to say this at [146]:
	


“[146] The exercise required by s 56(1) is a qualitative one: does the evidence have the quality of being capable of rationally affecting the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue? The exercise required in assessing probative value is a quantitative one: to what extent does the evidence have that quality?”


	
	Additionally in R v Burton her Honour said at [148] that a “necessary first step in the assessment of the probative value of evidence is to identify any ‘fact in issue’ the assessment of the probability of the existence of which is said to be affected by the evidence. The ultimate facts in issue in a criminal trial are the facts that constitute the elements of the offence charged. Often there will also be issues about facts relevant to those facts…”
	
	
	Her Honour also noted at [198] that the decision in that case to exclude the evidence based on s 137 resulted from an incorrect approach to the task required by the section. The starting point of the assessment is to assume that the inferences most favourable to the Crown will be drawn, and to assess the potential probative value on that basis, without regard to the availability of any competing inference. In the present case the inference most favourable to the Crown is the inference that the appellant had trained in the knife attack technique when he was in the USMC.
	
	
	Price J’s judgment of 8 September 2011 makes it clear that he adopted the three step process in determining the admissibility of the evidence under s 137. First he assessed the probative value of the evidence, finding that the evidence had substantial probative value. His Honour then evaluated the danger of unfair prejudice saying that he failed to see how the jury could be expected to misuse the evidence but would in any event give them an appropriate direction when the video was to be admitted. In carrying out the weighing exercise required as the third step his Honour concluded that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant.
	
	
	In the course of his Honour's summing up he directed the jury that “should they be satisfied that the accused was trained in a technique similar to that in the demonstration video, that finding alone cannot prove the guilt of the accused.” He further directed them that “I also repeat my direction that you must not reason that because the accused had been trained in the US Marines he is more likely to be the sort of person that would be involved in the killing of another; that would be totally wrong.”
	
	
	The Crown submitted that his Honour engaged in all of the correct steps in the application of s 137. The Crown submitted that there was no error shown in his Honour’s approach or in his findings as to the probative value of the evidence, the danger of unfair prejudice that it may have had or the balancing exercise that he carried out.
	


Consideration


	
	The appellant’s background of military experience and associated training was an historical fact. Taken alone, it carried with it no prejudice of any kind. It did not compel or suggest anything unfavourable to the appellant. For example, it may be contrasted with evidence of a criminal record, which carries with it certain underpinning assumptions that are generally and obviously definitively prejudicial.
	
	
	In the same way, the Tyler video was neither prejudicial to the appellant nor unfairly so. It was clearly a reconstruction. It was accompanied by an audio description of what was being demonstrated. It did not purport to go beyond matters that had previously been described in oral evidence by another witness. The prospect that the jury could misuse the evidence if uninstructed about it seems to me to have been remote. The prospect that the jury would have done so having been directed in the terms adopted by his Honour seems to me to be even more remote.
	
	
	The probative value of the evidence has already been considered. I am not satisfied that the probative value of the Tyler video is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant.
	


Ground 2


	
	The appellant submitted that upon the whole of the evidence it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty. He relied upon the following matters:
	



	
	No one witnessed the killing.
	
	
	No weapon has been recovered.
	
	
	No forensic evidence connects the appellant to the scene.
	
	
	No one identified the appellant in the vicinity of the murder at the relevant time.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh altered her evidence from “[h]e never do something like this” to evidence that tended to incriminate the appellant.
	
	
	The USMC knife training evidence was inadmissible.
	



	
	The appellant contended that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.
	


The Crown’s response


	
	The Crown submitted that individually and collectively the “imperfections” in the Crown case are no bar to a conviction provided that the evidence that was before the jury could otherwise sustain a guilty verdict.
	
	
	There is no rule of law which mandates that there must be a witness to any incident that results in a death that is alleged to be murder. The fact that no murder weapon was discovered, the fact that there is no forensic evidence that places the appellant at the murder scene, or the fact that no witness can identify the appellant in the immediate vicinity of the murder at the relevant time are no bar to a conviction on a charge of murder.
	
	
	In the course of the trial Samantha Marsh identified the appellant from CCTV footage that placed him in Victoria Street Chatswood less than 20 minutes or so after he fled from the premises at Holland Street, which is a distance of about 700 metres and easily walked in minutes by a fit man.
	
	
	There are also cogent and rational reasons why Samantha Marsh altered the version of evidence that she originally gave to police.
	
	
	The Crown reiterated that the evidence of the knife training that the appellant underwent in the USMC was admissible and its probative value was extremely high. The Crown case at trial was a combination of direct evidence and circumstantial evidence which resulted in a strong prosecution case. The Crown contended that based upon the whole of the evidence in the trial it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.
	


Consideration


	
	This ground necessitates an understanding of the detail of the Crown case at trial, which was based on both direct and circumstantial evidence that combined to make an overwhelming and irresistible prosecution case.
	
	
	The direct evidence consisted in a series of admissions made by the appellant to his wife Samantha Marsh shortly after the murder of the deceased on 27 April 2010 at about 7:00pm and other associated direct observations that she made of the appellant in the weeks leading up to and in the days immediately following the killing. There was also evidence from the appellant's brother in law of his conversations with and observations of the behaviour of the appellant both before and after the death. Combined with the direct evidence, the Crown case also included a large and compelling body of circumstantial evidence. This was grouped into six discrete categories as follows:
	



	
	The appellant's presence in Victoria Avenue so soon after the murder.
	
	
	The accused disposing of three backpacks, a bum bag, a jacket and other items of clothing in the days following the murder.
	
	
	Evidence of motive.
	
	
	The incredible story about 'the Service' told by the appellant to Clementine Cuneo and the Mormons.
	
	
	Similarities between the sentry attack manoeuvre taught to United States Marines, the way in which the appellant practised a manoeuvre on Samantha Marsh and her brother and the way in which the deceased was killed.
	
	
	The appellant’s attempt to flee Australia.
	



	
	The direct evidence consisted of the following witnesses.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh gave evidence that she had received an indemnity from prosecution from the Attorney General of NSW and a certificate under the Evidence Act from the presiding trial judge to prevent any evidence that she would give from being used against her providing that she told the truth. Samantha Marsh told the court that she had met the appellant in Vietnam in 2007, married him in Australia in 2008 and at the time of the killing of the deceased in April 2010 was living with him together with her brother in an apartment in Mowbray Road, Chatswood.
	
	
	The appellant worked as a registered nurse in the Emergency Department at the Royal North Shore Hospital and it was through this employment that he had obtained a 457 working visa which allowed both he and Samantha Marsh to reside in Australia. Samantha Marsh said that the appellant had told her on a number of occasions that the deceased, who was effectively his work supervisor at the hospital, had “too much power, that she bullied staff and that one day she needed to go”. The appellant did not like the deceased.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh said that the appellant had significant child support obligations to his former wife in the United States, with whom he had a daughter born in 1992 and that she had made some child support payments on his behalf on more than ten occasions. There were difficulties for the appellant obtaining a new passport while this debt remained unpaid.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh was aware that the appellant's work contract had expired at the hospital and that this had worried and concerned him, although he was actively looking for new employment in the nursing field. He also told her that one of the recruitment agencies that he had contacted told him that he had “got bad reference” and as a result he would not be able to find employment.
	
	
	A few days later the appellant told Samantha Marsh that he thought that the only person who would give him a bad reference was the deceased. He further told her that even though he had not put the deceased's name down as a referee, he knew that she would not give him a good reference. Potential employers would go through the Nursing Unit Manager as the first person if they wanted to check on the referee list.
	
	
	The appellant made a brief trip to the Unites States in March 2010 and returned to Australia on 14 March 2010. The appellant told Samantha Marsh that he knew where the deceased lived, her routine and that there was an electricity box at the front of the house, a sensor alarm and some “kid's pushbikes that look like they have not been used for ages…”. The appellant told Samantha Marsh prior to the death of the deceased that the only way to disable the sensor light at the front of the deceased's house was by spraying it with black paint or by turning off the electricity at the front of the house.
	
	
	During the month before the death of the deceased, the appellant told Samantha Marsh that he had received “permission from the organisation in Ireland to kill Michelle Beets”. The appellant also told her that he wanted to confront her “by pretending to distribute the Mormon books” and that he wanted to “freak her out, to scare her”.
	
	
	The appellant also told Samantha Marsh that he had tried to call the deceased a few times to check her routine from a phone booth outside Westfield Chatswood.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh saw the appellant about two weeks prior to the day of the killing wearing particular clothing that she had not seen before or since. The clothing included track pants, a dark blue T shirt with a vee neck with 'AIKMEN' written on the front, a really baggy grey “hoodie” and some black Converse shoes. The appellant told her that he had bought these clothes very cheaply from a second hand clothing store called “St Vinnie”. When she joked with him about the clothing making him look younger, he said that the clothing was “for a special purpose”.
	
	
	The appellant bought a pair of green and yellow rubber household gloves which were about 20cm long from Coles in Westfield about a week to a week and a half before the killing.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh gave evidence that the appellant owned a Ka Bar knife which was a type of “military knife - a Marine knife”. The appellant told her that he had purchased it in a knife store as it “remind him of the time he was in Marine”. The appellant had modified the Ka Bar knife because “it was too big for my hand”.
	
	
	About a week before the killing of the deceased, Samantha Marsh saw the appellant with a flick knife which was small, being about 10mm [sic] when folded and about 20cm when open. She witnessed him practising flicking the knife open on more than one occasion but she never saw the knife again after the killing.
	
	
	About a week and a half before the killing the appellant asked her if he could practise something on her. She agreed and the appellant came up behind her and held her neck or the upper part of her shoulder with his left hand and with his right hand he was holding something black. He then told her to raise her hand up to take his left hand away from her neck and then he pretended to stab under her arms and chest. She became scared and asked him to stop.
	
	
	On the evening of 27 April 2010 Samantha Marsh and the appellant agreed to meet in front of Westfield at Chatswood at 7:00pm. She identified herself arriving at Chatswood railway station on 27 April 2010 from still photos and video footage taken on that day. She further recognised clothing, including a white cap worn by a man depicted in the video footage, as looking like clothing that the appellant was wearing on that night.
	
	
	When she viewed the video she recognised the man depicted wearing the white cap as the appellant. She confirmed that she had met the appellant in front of the main entrance to Westfield. She also saw an image of a man with a white cap holding a plastic bag on video footage outside Mr Vitamins. She was with him at that time as they walked home. She identified the male image's feet as the appellant's feet as he was wearing a pair of “flip flops” which she described as “a sandal without the back, without the back strap” that she had bought for him.
	
	
	When she met the appellant he was wearing a white sporty T shirt with Adidas written on the front, track pants and no jacket even though it was “really cold that night”. She further described the cap as a very light brown cap with a kangaroo “right at the top. It's an Australian sort”. He was carrying a laptop without a “pouch”. This was the first time that she had seen the appellant carry the laptop without it being either in a pouch or a backpack “which he normally used every single day”. She also recognised the plastic bag as one from the Great Northern or Southern Hotel.
	
	
	Whilst walking home after meeting at Chatswood, as they turned the corner across from Gloria Jeans near Westfield, the appellant told Samantha Marsh “that it was done”. She did not understand what he meant at first and she asked him again. He told her again “it was done”. He said “the bitch is gone. From now on I shouldn't have any more bad references; that we should have a better future.” They continued to walk straight ahead, turned right at the Mandarin Centre and passed under the bridge.
	
	
	The appellant said nothing until they “walked straight into Pacific Highway”, but while they were waiting for the traffic light to change he told her “I'm not sure if she's dead”. He said that things did not go as expected that night as there were people around and they had noticed something as the deceased “kept screaming” and he had to run away while she was still alive.
	
	
	The appellant told Samantha Marsh that when the deceased arrived home her car light remained on, which was not her usual routine. When she realised that there was no light in front of the house “she stepped backwards”. He also told Samantha Marsh that he broke a window pane before the deceased arrived home to make it look like a break and enter. He said that when she stepped backwards he had to come up to grab her, then put her on the ground but she continued screaming.
	
	
	The appellant told the deceased that if she stopped screaming he would not hurt her. The deceased said “Yeah I will stop screaming. I'm just afraid you're going to hurt me that's all.” The appellant told Samantha Marsh that “then, as soon as she stopped screaming…I took out a knife and cut her throat.” He was disturbed by people walking near the house. He bumped into them and they unsuccessfully tried to stop him. He did not think that they recognised him as he had a beanie on, which only showed his eyes, and a hoodie over his head.
	
	
	As they walked a little further the appellant told Samantha Marsh that he had thrown the gloves worn and the knife used in the attack into a storm water drain. She did not know what a storm water drain was so he stopped and showed her one on the way home. He told her that he had discarded the clothes that he had worn in various garbage bins where there was no CCTV surveillance along the route back to Westfield at Chatswood.
	
	
	He explained that when he got away from the house he changed in an empty garage which was surrounded by bush and which no one ever used. He had left his backpack in this garage before he went to the deceased's house so he was able to come back there and get changed quickly before he left. He remarked to her that “It was very clean. I didn't have that much blood on, so it was very fast and I didn't take that much time to get changed.” He also told her that the knife was not as sharp or as good as he expected “…so that's why he cut her throat many times.”
	
	
	The appellant and Samantha Marsh approached an apartment block about five minutes' walk away from their home, which had a swimming pool in the grounds. The appellant took off his clothes and jumped into the water, quickly washing his entire body and rubbing his hair. He then got out of the pool, put his clothes back on, closed the gate and walked home with her. She identified photographs that showed the unit block with the swimming pool where this occurred.
	
	
	On the way home the appellant stopped Samantha Marsh from attempting to kiss him as he was “dirty”. He also told her that he had turned off the electricity in front of the deceased's home before she arrived home.
	
	
	When they arrived home the appellant asked Samantha Marsh to use her key to let them in, whereupon he went to the downstairs communal laundry. He asked her to bring him some fresh clothes and a rubbish bag. When she came to the laundry the appellant dumped the wet clothes that he had worn earlier into the rubbish bag. The appellant then told her that he was going out for ten minutes.
	
	
	When he returned to the apartment the appellant no longer had the rubbish bag with him but was still wearing the flip flops. He walked straight into the kitchen “and he washed his hands many times…”. He sat on the couch and had some alcohol and then stood up and took off the flip flops saying that he was going to discard them and that he would be back in a few minutes. He left and came back a few minutes later. Samantha Marsh never saw those flip flops again.
	
	
	After the death of the deceased the appellant told Samantha Marsh not to talk about the matter at all from then on as there “might be a listening device somewhere in the house…” He told her that he had thrown away the Ka Bar knife as he said that “It was not good to have a weapon like that in the house just in case the local authority or the police come and check. It just doesn't look good on you.”
	
	
	About a week before his arrest the appellant told Samantha Marsh that he was not worried about the police coming and arresting him for murder as he was more worried about “people from inside the secret organisation in Ireland who would come knocking at the door and kill him.” He told her that she would receive a large sum of money from an insurance account set up under her name and that it would be enough for her to live on for the rest of her life. The next day she asked him about this outside the apartment on the street and he told her that it was “all a lie” as he “meant to say that in the house because there's a listening device in the house. I was just fooling the police around that's all.”
	
	
	Samantha Marsh also listened to two taped conversations that were tendered in evidence.
	
	
	Between 27 April 2010 and 19 May 2010 Samantha Marsh spoke to investigating police at least three or four times. Police had come to her home twice and also to her place of work. Prior to 19 May 2010 she did not tell police the truth as to what she knew about the death of the deceased. She explained that she made the earlier untruthful statements because she was still living with the appellant and she was concerned not only for her own safety but that of her brother. Additionally, in Vietnamese culture a wife is expected to be loyal to her husband. The appellant had also told her that she was not allowed to say anything to police under American law but he did not know what the law on that point was here.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh was cross-examined at length as to why she did not tell the police about the matters that she gave evidence about prior to 19 and 20 May 2010.
	
	
	It was only after the appellant's arrest on 19 May 2010 (when he was arrested for a forensic testing procedure and taken to Hornsby Police Station) that Samantha Marsh spoke to the police and told them what she knew about the appellant's involvement in the killing of the deceased. On that day she had provided a written statement to police which was not the truth. Detective Laidlaw, a senior police officer, told her that he had been a police officer for more than thirty years and he knew when people were lying. He believed that she knew the truth and she should think carefully about her life as she was young and would regret not telling the truth one day. Police took her back to the apartment which was surrounded by media. She then asked police to take her back to the police station whereupon she told them the truth.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh was also cross-examined at length as to what benefits she received from the NSW Police Service. This was disclosed by her to have been a sum of $360 per week which she started to receive when she moved out of the apartment in Chatswood. She said that her brother also received a bicycle from the police.
	
	
	The Crown promoted Samantha Marsh to the jury as an honest and reliable witness. Even though she had initially told lies to police, that was said to be understandable. Apart from the reasons of traditional Vietnamese cultural loyalty, between 27 April 2010 and 19 May 2010 Samantha Marsh remained living in an intimate domestic relationship with the appellant. Her brother was with them too. She was aware of the appellant's physical strength and his training with and his ownership of knives. Moreover, on 27 April 2010 she had just received his confession to the killing of the deceased in a carefully planned, chillingly violent and barbaric manner. Both Samantha Marsh and her brother were potentially exposed to significant risk from the appellant.
	
	
	Furthermore, on almost all of the critical pieces of Samantha Marsh's evidence there was independent evidence elsewhere in the Crown case that supported her account such that the jury could have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to her credibility and the truthfulness of her account of the confession. For example, she met the appellant outside Westfield at about 7:00pm on 27 April 2010. There was in fact evidence available in the form of CCTV footage that placed the appellant in the vicinity of Westfield between 6:45pm and 7:00pm. Samantha Marsh identified that person as the appellant. The appellant himself admitted in his ERISP that he met Samantha Marsh in front of Westfield on this particular night a little before 7:00pm.
	
	
	Detective Scott Bennett, who was qualified as a “temporary expert” by virtue of his familiarity with the CCTV footage and his prior observations of the appellant, gave evidence that he also recognised the male in the CCTV footage as the appellant.
	
	
	The jury had the opportunity to look at a photo of the appellant's right arm that displayed a distinctive tattoo that looked like a series of linked motifs on his wrist. The jury could compare this photo of the appellant with the male on the CCTV footage and still photographs taken from it. The tattoo visible on the appellant's right wrist in the photo taken in the forensic procedure on 20 May 2010 is visible in the still photo taken from the CCTV footage on 27 April 2010 at Westfield Chatswood. Other photos also depict a male said to be the appellant wearing an identical white Adidas T shirt on 20 March 2010 that is the same as the shirt being worn by the appellant outside Westfield on 27 April 2010.
	
	
	Arguably the most critical aspect of Samantha Marsh's evidence is the confession that the appellant made to her on their way home after meeting her outside Westfield at 7:00pm. It included a significant amount of detail amongst which there were four discrete pieces of information that were never disclosed by police to the media or alternatively released but not disclosed by the media.
	
	
	First, it was never reported to the media that there were two scooters on the porch at the deceased's premises. Despite this, Samantha Marsh gave this detail in her account of what the appellant described to her as how the outside of the deceased's home appeared when he had reconnoitred there prior to the killing. She was clearly describing two scooters. Crime scene photos depict them propped up against the wall at the deceased's home. David Grant, the deceased’s partner, also confirmed that the two scooters were his and they had been there for a couple of months.
	
	
	Secondly, it was never reported to the media that there was a broken window on the laundry door at the deceased's premises. However, Samantha Marsh told police that the appellant told her that he had broken a window to make it look like a burglary.
	
	
	Thirdly, it was never reported to the media that it was unusual for the deceased to reverse her motor vehicle into her driveway. However, Samantha Marsh told police that the appellant had told her that things had gone unexpectedly that night as the deceased had kept her car lights on. This was consistent with the deceased reversing her car into the car port instead of driving in. Photos of the premises show a car in a carport facing towards the street consistent with having reversed in. In such a position the car lights would have beamed light into the front garden near where the attack took place. If the vehicle had driven into the carport, the lights would have beamed away from that area at the front of the house. Moreover, on 27 April 2010 at about 6:10 pm or 6:15 pm, Brittany Simpson walked past the deceased's home and saw a Camry vehicle making three or four attempts to reverse into the driveway before successfully reversing into the carport. Ms Simpson identified the vehicle as being in approximately the same position as the vehicle she saw on the day.
	
	
	Finally, it was never reported to the media that a number of phone calls had been made to the deceased's home from public phones. Nonetheless Samantha Marsh told police that the appellant had made several calls to the deceased from payphones outside Westfield. That is supported by the telephone records produced by Adam Gelfe. He said that the deceased had a landline connected in her name at 28 Holland Street, Chatswood. That information was available to the public in the New South Wales White Pages for the years between 2005 and 2010. The first call identified as being of interest was made on 5 April 2010 at 5:15 pm from a Telstra payphone located at 400 Victoria Avenue, Chatswood to the deceased's landline. The call lasted 10 seconds. A second call to the deceased's landline was made on 15 April 2010 at 12:24 pm that lasted 12 seconds. That call was made from a pay phone situated at 358A Victoria Street, Darlinghurst. There was evidence from Detective Sergeant Peter Smith, who presented the appellant’s banking records showing a transaction at an ATM situated about 500 metres away from that payphone at about 1:36 pm on 15 April 2010. This was about 52 minutes after the phone call was made to the deceased's landline. A third call to the deceased's landline was made on 18 April 2010 at 16:48 from the payphone at 400 Victoria Avenue, Chatswood. Alan Grochulski knew the deceased very well. About three to four weeks before she died the deceased told him that she was receiving phone calls, and messages were being left for her to call the appellant. The deceased told Mr Grochulski that she did not want to speak to the appellant and was avoiding him.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh knew these significant details and included them in her account of the appellant's admissions and confession to her. They had not been released to the public. They are details of such specificity and accuracy that her knowledge cannot be explained by coincidence or chance.
	
	
	There were various other incidental pieces in the Crown case which supported the evidence of Samantha Marsh. She gave evidence that the appellant had told her that there was a sensor light at the front of the deceased's premises and he had disconnected the power before the deceased arrived home. The control room of the security company received notification that the alarm had gone off at exactly 6:00pm due to a power failure at the premises.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh gave evidence that the appellant had told her that things had gone unexpectedly that night for a number of reasons and he was not sure if the deceased was dead when he left. He told her that there were people around and their attention was aroused because of the deceased's screams so he had to run away. This aspect of her evidence is confirmed by Gordon Bevan and his wife Carmel Bevan who were walking their dog past 28 Holland Street at about 6:15 pm when they heard a female screaming. Upon investigation Mr Bevan found the deceased who was dying on the porch.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh said that the appellant owned a Ka Bar knife but had thrown it away after the death of the deceased as he said it would look bad if the police came around and found it. The appellant acknowledged that he owned such a knife and he threw it away after the death of the deceased but justified his actions saying he had ruined it when trying to modify it.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh gave evidence that one evening the appellant wanted to practise a manoeuvre on her but she became frightened and asked him to stop. Her evidence was supported by her brother who gave an account of a very similar manoeuvre that the appellant practised on him.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh said that on many occasions the appellant demonstrated animosity towards the deceased. That is borne out in the conversations between the appellant and Samantha Marsh recorded on the listening device tape.
	
	
	Peter Neave, the security guard at the Royal North Shore Hospital, also gave evidence of the appellant's animosity towards the deceased. He had worked at the hospital for about five years and the appellant was the only person who had ever said anything bad to him about the deceased. David Ellis was also a security guard employed there and he said the same thing. Alki Georgiallis worked for Reid Recruitment and also spoke of the appellant’s dislike for the deceased.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh said that the appellant had told her that he had ridden his bike past the deceased's home several times. Melissa Clemens and Andrew Craig, who were renovating a house in Holland Street, said that they saw a man on a bike acting suspiciously riding slowly up and down Holland Street on 21 April and 24 April 2010. Mr Craig was shown a selection of photos of bicycles which included a photo of the appellant's bike and he selected the photo of the appellants' bike.
	
	
	Katrina Kyneur gave evidence that the deceased had told her on 21 April 2010 that she had seen the appellant in her street “the other day” and that she put her head down and kept walking.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh’s brother gave evidence that the appellant had asked him to come along to the home of the deceased on a particular occasion.
	
	
	A careful analysis of the evidence of Samantha Marsh, taking into account all of the areas of support for the critical aspects of her evidence, reveals no discrepancies and displays no inadequacies. Her evidence is not tainted in any way. It is powerful, persuasive and of substantial probative force. A jury would not have experienced a reasonable doubt in relying upon it to find the appellant guilty of murder.
	
	
	Samantha Marsh’s evidence was further supported by the evidence of her brother who was granted an indemnity from prosecution by the Attorney-General. He lived with the appellant and Samantha Marsh in their Mowbray Road apartment. He gave evidence that he saw the appellant with a “folding knife” several times but not after the death of the deceased. He said that he saw the appellant in the lounge room waving the folding knife around in the air. He drew a sketch of it.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that this smaller knife, being the folding knife or a flick knife was one that was used to murder the deceased. It was never located. Samantha Marsh’s brother also saw the appellant with a Ka Bar knife which he had modified to make smaller.
	
	
	On the Friday before the murder the appellant asked his brother in law “to go to a home of a nurse and be there, looking around and tell him whether or not any person come in…and he said the reason he was going to the home because that nurse had been trying to prevent him from getting a job, so he wanted to come to see her and do something bad to her, so that she wouldn't prevent him from getting a job”. The appellant told him the house was ten minutes away by bike. He said he would go but did not end up doing so.
	
	
	A substantial part of this witness’s evidence dealt with an occasion when he said the appellant asked him to participate in the appellant practising a knife attack upon him from behind. The witness described what the appellant did with a wooden spoon and then demonstrated to the court with Detective Dixon. The Crown case was that this provided powerful support to Samantha Marsh's evidence that the appellant had done a similar thing to her, but it also connected powerfully with the evidence concerning the appellant’s military training and the similarities that the injuries received in such an attack would have with the injuries inflicted upon the deceased.
	
	
	This witness also gave evidence that the appellant had asked him to hold a cucumber so that he could chop it with his folding knife. That evidence supported Samantha Marsh's account that the appellant had a smaller knife than the Ka Bar and that the appellant used the knife in an attack as he was actively preparing for it shortly before the death of the deceased.
	
	
	The Crown also led a substantial body of circumstantial evidence at trial notionally in six discrete categories.
	


(1) The appellant's presence in Victoria Avenue so soon after the murder. 


	
	This has been referred to already.
	


(2) The accused disposed of three backpacks, a bum bag, a jacket and other items of clothing in the days following the murder.


	
	It was the Crown case that the appellant disposed of a number of items including a jacket, a bum bag and three backpacks following the murder. This was in addition to the clothing, the gloves and the flick knife that he disposed of directly after the murder when fleeing towards Victoria Avenue. This dispossession by the appellant of his belongings was on the Crown case borne out of the appellant's overwhelming preoccupation to rid himself of any item which may connect him to the crime scene.
	
	
	The various images of a male depicted on a video compilation show him wearing a jacket when first seen on the CCTV footage and carrying a bum bag. Later in the same footage the male no longer has the bum bag and is no longer wearing the jacket. Samantha Marsh said that when she met the appellant at 7:00pm he was wearing no jacket even though it was really cold that night. The video footage shows the male apparently disposing of something into a bin at Chatswood Chase. This was said to be the bum bag.
	
	
	The appellant also disposed of three backpacks after the murder. The first was said to be the one he was seen with at the murder scene by the Bevans and by Mrs Hernandez. That backpack was known to Samantha Marsh but she never saw it after the death of the deceased and it was never located by police. This first backpack is not seen to be carried by the appellant in CCTV footage.
	
	
	At about 10:30 am on 28 April 2010 the appellant went to Chatswood Chase and bought another backpack. He put the backpack that he had brought with him in the bin. When asked by police why he disposed of that second backpack the appellant said that a motor vehicle collided with him when he was riding his bike. The backpack was damaged in the collision although he was not injured and the bike was not damaged. Two days later the appellant disposed of the new backpack which he had bought on 28 April 2010 in a bin outside his premises in Mowbray Road. He returned to Kmart to buy a fourth backpack on 30 April 2010. The appellant told police that he did that because the one that he had previously bought on 28 April 2010 and thrown away was too small for his needs. He bought another one which he thought was bigger but in fact it turned out to be the same size.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that these explanations given by the appellant were fictitious and that the real reason the appellant sought to dispose of the numerous backpacks, the bum bag and the jacket was because he was completely consumed with the idea that there may be a forensic link between those items and the death of the deceased. This became almost obsessive behaviour as the paranoia about a potential forensic link between himself and his belongings and the crime scene mounted.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that the appellant's behaviour in throwing away these particular items was entirely consistent with his behaviour on the night of the murder when he jumped in the swimming pool and washed himself, got changed in the downstairs laundry and asked for a new set of clothes and a rubbish bag to be brought to him. It was also consistent with the fact that he threw away the wet clothes and flip flops and washed his hands many times in the kitchen before taking a shower.
	


(3) Motive


	
	There was a significant amount of evidence that the appellant owed a large debt to his former wife for outstanding child support. United States authorities would not issue him with a new passport whilst the child support debt remained. The appellant obtained a 457 visa through his work as a registered nurse at Royal North Shore Hospital but that visa was put in grave jeopardy when his contract of employment ceased in February 2010.
	
	
	The appellant wrote an email to a Fathers' Helpline on 18 May 2010 about his position regarding the passport renewal while having a child support debt. He excused his language and wrote “….I'm about as fucked as a man can be….I have only one page left in my passport and I read that if you're more than 2,500 USDs behind in your child support payments the Government can seize your passport…”.
	
	
	A substantial body of evidence was led by the Crown about the appellant's many attempts to obtain positions in various hospitals. He tried for a large number of nursing jobs but was unsuccessful. He blamed the deceased for giving him a bad reference and spoke of her in disparaging terms. As at 27 April 2010 he had been out of work for two months and 17 days.
	


(4) The appellant’s fanciful story to the Mormons and Clementine Cuneo.


	
	On 14 May 2010 at about 4:15pm the appellant invited two elders from the Mormon Church who had previously befriended him to his apartment in Mowbray Road. They arrived with their supervisor at about 4:30pm.
	
	
	It was the Crown case, based on the evidence of Samantha Marsh, that the appellant thought that there was a listening device planted in the apartment. Nonetheless he proceeded to tell them about “the service” that had picked him to take the blame for the murder of a woman near there. “The service” would take his DNA and fingerprints and use them presumably to set him up. He said that he would probably be arrested for murder soon but his family would be paid for him taking the blame.
	
	
	The appellant cultivated contact with a Daily Telegraph journalist Clementine Cuneo in the days following the murder of the deceased when there was overwhelming media interest in the story. He met up with her several times and they had various conversations. On 18 May 2010 the appellant spoke at length with Ms Cuneo on the telephone and the conversations were recorded by lawful warrant.
	
	
	The appellant told Ms Cuneo that all of the paperwork that police had seized from his home that day was “bogus”. He said that the paperwork was made for him, he had never worked in the “kind of military the United States endows” but he had sold his services to the “highest bidder”. He said that he was being paid by a “service” to take the blame for the deceased’s murder as he needed the money.
	
	
	The appellant also told Ms Cuneo that he had prostate cancer, did not have much longer to live and that “the service” knew that. It had started “months and months and months ago” when “the service” realised he had cancer. He said that the plan involved being arrested, going to gaol and then his family would get the money.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that this story was a lie that the appellant, with full knowledge that he was responsible for the death of the deceased and fearful that his arrest was imminent, had made up in an attempt deliberately to put the police off the track and to divert the investigation away from him.
	


(5) Similarities between the sentry attack manoeuvre taught to United States Marines and the way in which the appellant practised a manoeuvre on Samantha Marsh and her brother and the way in which the deceased was killed.


	
	This discrete category of circumstantial evidence has already been discussed.
	


(6) Flight


	
	Ms Khedjia Straub worked at Flight Centre in Chatswood. On 10 May 2010 the appellant went to the business and paid a deposit on the purchase of a flight to the United States. He did not pay the balance for the flight.
	
	
	On 19 May 2010 the appellant again attended Flight Centre wanting to buy a one way ticket to the United States. He wanted to leave in a couple of days and suggested 25 May 2010. Subsequent searches for flights and prices revealed that it was cheaper to buy a return ticket than to buy a one way flight.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that the appellant, attempting to leave Australia hours before he was arrested and without his wife, demonstrated that he was fearful that he was about to be apprehended.
	
	
	It is difficult not to be satisfied that the Crown presented an overwhelming case at trial consisting of both direct evidence and multiple categories of circumstantial evidence. Samantha Marsh gave a compelling account of a confession made to her by the appellant shortly after the murder occurred. Her evidence was strongly supported by independent witnesses. The circumstantial case was equally powerful.
	
	
	In Soames v R [2012] NSWCCA 188 at [47] – [48] the Court said this:
	


“[47] The principles to be applied in a consideration of this ground are well settled: M v R [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606; SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400, and R v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; (2010) 85 ALJR 8.

[48] In M v R, at 493, and 494 - 495, the High Court stated:-

‘Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.

In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt...’

[49] It is not sufficient in order to discharge this function to determine whether there is evidence upon which a jury could have convicted. The question is whether the jury ought to have experienced a reasonable doubt.”


	
	In determining a ground of appeal based on an unreasonable verdict, the court is to make an independent assessment of the evidence both as to sufficiency and quality and to determine if it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. In Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126 the applicable principles were reaffirmed at [31] – [32]:
	


“[31] In determining a ground of appeal which asserts, for the purpose of s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, this Court is required to apply the test set down in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, and restated in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. The Court is to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both to its sufficiency and quality. This involves a question of fact. The Court is to determine whether the evidence is such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty. The central question is whether this Court is satisfied that the Appellant is guilty of the offence charged in the first count: Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 85 ALJR 571 at 575 [11]-[14], 576-577 [20]-[22].

[32] In exercising that function, the evidence ought not be considered piecemeal: The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48]; The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397 at 435 [128]. This Court is required to consider the totality of evidence before the jury. This involves an assessment of direct evidence of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from a combination of events: Rasic v R at [29].”


	
	I have referred at some length to the evidence at the trial. I have attempted to make my own independent assessment of that evidence, both as to its sufficiency and quality. No part of my review leads me to have the slightest doubt about the guilt of the appellant. There is in my view no basis for any doubt that the evidence is such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. Whether as a formulation of the direct evidence alone or in combination with the circumstantial case mounted by the Crown at trial, I am left with no reasonable doubt, and none that I consider a jury properly instructed ought to have, or even might have, entertained, concerning the guilt of the accused. The Crown submitted that the case at trial was “irresistible”. I agree. Moreover, there appear to be no further or other factors that demonstrate any lack of probative force which could lead this Court to conclude, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, that there was a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted.
	


Ground 3


	
	The appellant submitted that the evidence properly admitted at the trial did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that he caused the death of the deceased. The Crown’s circumstantial case included the following matters:
	



	
	The appellant’s alleged confession to his wife.
	
	
	The detail which the appellant’s wife furnished in connection with that confession.
	
	
	CCTV footage of the appellant in the vicinity of the incident at the relevant time.
	
	
	The appellant’s disposal of the bum bag and various other items that might have contained trace evidence.
	
	
	Evidence of the appellant’s motive to kill the deceased.
	
	
	Listening device evidence concerning the appellant’s supposed membership of an organisation suggesting falsely that he was implicated in the killing.
	
	
	Evidence from the appellant’s brother in law that the appellant simulated a knife attack technique upon him in the weeks prior to the death of the deceased, which was said to be similar to the technique apparently used to kill her.
	
	
	Evidence from the appellant’s wife in her ERISP that the appellant had simulated a knife attack technique on her involving a cut to the throat.
	
	
	Evidence from Kelly Dee that the appellant had said to her that he knew how to kill someone by slitting his or her throat.
	
	
	The appellant’s inquiries about purchasing a one way ticket to Los Angeles.
	



	
	The appellant contended that these pieces of evidence neither alone nor collectively were capable of establishing the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt. He referred this Court to Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [41] and [44] as follows:
	


“[41] That task is to be undertaken in the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the ‘natural limitations’ that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty. There will be cases, perhaps many cases, where those natural limitations require the appellate court to conclude that it cannot reach the necessary degree of satisfaction. In such a case the proviso would not apply, and apart from some exceptional cases, where a verdict of acquittal might be entered, it would be necessary to order a new trial. But recognising that there will be cases where the proviso does not apply does not exonerate the appellate court from examining the record for itself.

…

[44]… No single universally applicable description of what constitutes ‘no substantial miscarriage of justice’ can be given. But one negative proposition may safely be offered. It cannot be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty.”


	
	It was implicit in the appellant’s submissions on this ground that the knife training and attack evidence had not been properly admitted.
	


The Crown’s response


	
	The Crown maintained that the evidence that the appellant received knife attack training in the USMC was admissible. Even if that evidence were wrongly admitted, the Crown submitted that the appeal would still be dismissed as no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred.
	
	
	For the proviso to apply it is necessary for the Court to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that evidence properly admitted at the trial proved the guilt of the accused: see Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [44]; Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; (2001) 208 CLR 593 at [226]; Campbell v R [2014] NSWCCA 175 at [262].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Crown case at trial was, even in the absence of the appellant's military training with knives, compelling, overwhelming and irresistible and that this is a case in which the proviso ought to be applied.
	


Consideration


	
	As already discussed, I have undertaken my own independent assessment of the evidence. I have made due allowance for the fact that I did not see or hear the various witnesses who gave their evidence in the Crown case, nor did I have the opportunity to form any view about their evidence based upon demeanour or reaction to cross-examination. I have been limited to the transcript of that evidence, which I have referred to for the purposes of my consideration.
	
	
	Having performed that undertaking, I am entirely satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. I am persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at the trial proved the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt of the murder of the deceased. This was in the scheme of cases of this type what can fairly be described as an overwhelming Crown case. I am of that view even if my conclusions about his Honour’s decision to admit the knife attack video evidence that the appellant complains was improperly admitted were found to be incorrect. Put another way, I am of the view that the jury would have reached the same conclusion about the appellant’s guilt even if they had heard no evidence about his USMC training and service in general or evidence in the form of the Tyler video in particular.
	
	
	This is a case in which there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice and the proviso ought to be applied.
	


SENTENCE


	
	The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence upon the single ground that the sentence is manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides as follows:
	


“61 Mandatory life sentences for certain offences

(1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.”


	
	The appellant referred to R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; (2004) 59 NSWLR 557 and to the remarks of Wood CJ at CL at [69] as follows:
	


“[69] Obviously, the murder of three very young, vulnerable, innocent, and entirely defenceless children, while they were asleep, by their father, involves the grossest breach of trust imaginable. Left unexplained, or unmitigated by circumstances personal to the offender which might provide some reason for his resort to such extreme violence, or where accompanied by deliberate cruelty and suffering to the children, such a case could properly fall within the ambit of s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and, as such, justify life sentences.”


	
	The offender in that case was originally sentenced to three life sentences. This Court allowed the appeal and resentenced the offender to a series of partially accumulated determinate sentences totalling 34 years with an effective non-parole period of 27 years.
	
	
	The appellant relied upon Merritt as support for the contention that while sentencing for murder necessarily remains a discretionary exercise, a particular instance of that crime devoid of deliberate cruelty to, and suffering by, the deceased will fall outside the scope of the common law “worst category of cases” test and the s 61(1) test as well. Applying those tests to this case, the appellant contended that the objective degree of trauma evident to the deceased’s body did not automatically give rise to or support an assumption that she suffered in death in the manner contemplated by this Court in Merritt. It remained a matter for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt: Olbrich v The Queen [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the factors that removed this case from the worst category test and the terms of s 61(1) were the following:
	



	
	The absence of a motive of sexual or other gratification.
	
	
	The absence of torture as a precursor to the killing.
	
	
	A single victim as opposed to multiple victims.
	
	
	The appellant’s lack of any prior convictions for any previous offence.
	



	
	The appellant also pointed to the Crown concession in written submissions on sentence that the instant offence “falls in a range somewhere between and including the circumstances which would justify a life sentence pursuant to s 61(1)…and circumstances which fall just short of that”. The appellant contended that his offence does not fall within the worst category of cases or s 61(1) of the Act and that a determinate sentence should be imposed, somewhere in the vicinity of 32 years with a non-parole period of 24 years. If dated from 19 May 2010, the appellant would not be entitled to be released to parole before the age of 72 years.
	


The Crown’s response


	
	His Honour carefully reviewed the facts before him. His findings included that “the infliction of these hideous wounds on Ms Beets was extraordinarily cruel”. His Honour also referred to the “callousness with which the murder was committed”, demonstrated by the appellant's calm and composed demeanour on the CCTV footage taken shortly after the murder. His Honour found that the murder was meticulously planned, and that the manner of the killing was “cruel, merciless and abhorrent”.
	
	
	His Honour found little by way of mitigation apart from the appellant's lack of prior convictions and his USMC service and his nursing service. Nonetheless his Honour found that the appellant's prior good character was “completely overwhelmed by the objective seriousness of his offending”. His Honour found that the appellant demonstrated neither remorse nor contrition. He found beyond reasonable doubt that there was a risk that the appellant would offend again by killing a person whom he perceived to be seriously interfering with his plans or who may have been causing him distress.
	
	
	His Honour referred to s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and to the authorities relating to the worst category of offending. He found that the level of the appellant's culpability was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence could only be met by a sentence of life imprisonment.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive having regard to the following factors:
	



	
	the overall criminality involved in the offence before his Honour which he described as a “terrible crime” and found to be “at the top of the range for the offence of murder”.
	
	
	the extraordinary level of preparation that the appellant embarked upon before the murder which included:
	



	
	stalking the deceased by attending her home on several occasions;
	
	
	asking his brother in law to come with him to the deceased's home to keep watch for him;
	
	
	ringing the deceased from pay phones several times to establish her movements;
	
	
	conducting his own surveillance at the deceased's home to see how he could ambush her;
	
	
	buying clothes from a second hand store to wear while he killed the deceased;
	
	
	obtaining and practising chopping and slicing with two knives before the killing;
	
	
	practising the sentry attack manoeuvre on Samantha Marsh and her brother before the killing;
	
	
	attending the home of the deceased shortly prior to her return on the evening of 27 April 2010 to disable the sensor light and lie in wait for her;
	
	
	telling the deceased that if she stopped screaming he would not hurt her but cutting her throat when she did so;
	
	
	the extreme level of brutality used by the appellant in killing the deceased by slashing her neck several times with complete severance of the soft tissue at the front of her neck with cuts going through to the bone;
	
	
	the appellant's motive to kill the deceased because he believed that she was compromising his attempts to gain employment in the nursing profession and in turn that she was an obstacle to the retention of his 457 residential visa.
	



	
	The Crown submitted in these circumstances that it was plainly open to his Honour to make the findings that he did and to impose a life sentence.
	


Consideration


	
	It is trite to observe that there can never be a correct sentence in any particular case. As a definitively discretionary undertaking, the final decision by a judge about what sentence to impose can only be attacked by reference to a comparison between the decision arrived at and the material available to inform it. In the present case the appellant contends that his sentence is manifestly excessive or, in the absence of the identification of specific errors committed by the trial judge in forming his view, that no proper exercise of a sentencing discretion based upon the material before his Honour could have produced the same result. The appellant therefore contends that a review of his Honour’s decision must lead to the conclusion that it was not open to him in the particular circumstances of this case to impose a sentence of life imprisonment.
	
	
	It is also timely to observe that it is not to the point that another judge or other judges would, or might, have reached a different conclusion based upon the same evidence. Such an approach is erroneous for the obvious reason that it fails to recognise the fundamental characteristics of a discretionary decision. If the evidence before his Honour was such as to satisfy him that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence, then it is beside the point that others may not have formed the same view.
	
	
	In my opinion it was entirely open to his Honour upon the evidence before him to impose a sentence of life imprisonment upon the appellant. The level of criminality exposed by the evidence in this case is extreme. Taken alone, the significant individual features of the crime are chilling. There is evidence of the appellant’s motive that suggests a single minded decision to take a lethal course of action either for revenge or self-interest or both. There is an associated high level of relatively sophisticated planning. There is a similar high level of violence and the infliction of terrible wounds in what was clearly a sustained and merciless attack upon an innocent and defenceless victim. These matters combine to raise the awful spectre of future dangerousness to the community, evidenced by the disproportional relationship between the motive for the killing and its realisation.
	
	
	In combination these matters suggest a murder falling into the worst category of case, and distinctly within the terms of s 61(1). If the appellant’s emphasis is upon the absence of cruelty, his Honour’s remarks on sentence make it clear that he specifically took this factor into account in any event. His Honour said this at [34]:
	


“[34] The infliction of these hideous wounds upon Ms Beets was extraordinarily cruel. The offender told Samantha Marsh that he cut Ms Beets’ throat many times, as he tried to pretend it was the work of an amateur, He also said that the knife was not as sharp and as good as he expected.”


	
	His Honour’s conclusion was at [59] in these terms:
	


“[59] The offender meticulously planned the murder of Ms Beets as he perceived that she was an obstacle to the retention of his 457 visa. The manner in which he killed her was cruel, merciless and abhorrent. The offender’s crime falls within the worst category of murder. All four of the indicia in s 61(1) are present. There is nothing in the subjective circumstances of the offender, which justifies a lesser sentence.”


	
	I am unable to conclude that his Honour’s conclusions were unwarranted or unsupported. I am not satisfied that the sentence of imprisonment for life imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive.
	


Orders


	
	I would propose the following orders:
	



	
	Dismiss the appeal against conviction.
	
	
	Grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	ADAMSON J: I have had the benefit of reading the draft reasons of Harrison J. I have reviewed the whole of the evidence. I agree for the reasons given by Harrison J that it was open on the whole of that evidence for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of murder. The imposition of a life sentence was within the discretion available to the sentencing judge. No error has been established in the exercise of that discretion. I agree with the orders proposed and with his Honour's reasons.

2425410,JB v R [2015] NSWCCA 182,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL and ADAMS J:
	


Background

On 10 September 2009 the applicant (JB) was convicted of the murder of Edward Spowart. An appeal against conviction and sentence in this Court was unsuccessful (JB v R [2012] NSWCCA 12; 83 NSWLR 153). An application to the High Court for special leave was also unsuccessful (JB v R [2013] HCA Trans 28). Thereafter an application was made to a judge of this Court pursuant to s78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 for an inquiry into the conviction. That application was successful and R A Hulme J referred the whole of the case to this Court to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. The matter came before this Court as a result of that reference on 24 March 2015.


	
	The basis for the referral was the discovery of evidentiary material subsequent to the exhaustion of the avenues of appeal. That material concerned the evidence of an important prosecution witness in the applicant’s trial. The material raised questions of non-disclosure by police, non-compliance with the prosecution’s duty of disclosure and a possible conflict of interest on the part of the applicant’s solicitor at trial and on appeal.
	
	
	Given the limited nature of this judgment, it is not necessary to review in any detail that material. It is sufficient to say that an important part of the Crown case was that the applicant had made admissions at a police station following his arrest. The admissions were said to have been made to a support person, 107A, who was present because the applicant was a vulnerable person, being aged 15 at the time. The support person was a registered police informant.
	
	
	When the matter came before this Court, it was common ground between the applicant and the Crown that the conviction had to be quashed and that the only issue before the Court was whether the Court should order a retrial or enter a verdict of acquittal.
	
	
	Despite attempts by the Court to narrow the issues, the applicant maintained that he was entitled to review in detail every aspect of the prosecution case with a view to establishing that the investigation of the murder and the conduct of the prosecution against him were so tainted that the Court would take those matters into account when exercising its discretion as to whether or not to order an acquittal. In essence, the applicant’s position is that at all times the police officers concerned with the investigation knew that 107A was an informant and that he was deliberately placed with the applicant as a support person in order to obtain admissions from the applicant.
	
	
	In accordance with that approach the applicant had the court issue an order to produce directed to the Commissioner of Police requiring production, amongst other things, of the following:
	


“10   Records relating to 107A and JB on the “Police Source System” and underlying documents and/or information.

11   Any communications, documents, data or information accessed or accessible by Detective M, Detective F and/or Sergeant H disclosing the status of 107A as a police source.

12   Documentation of communications between the police and 107A relating to JB, both prior and subsequent to 107A’s attendance at Merrylands Police Station.”


	
	In argument before this Court that order was modified so that the Commissioner was required, subject to any claim for public interest immunity, to produce the Police Source System records relating to 107A to which Inspector O had access up to 1 September 2009. Inspector O was 107A’s handler at the time when the admissions were said to have been made, i.e. 22 – 23 April 2008.
	
	
	Counsel appearing for the Commissioner of Police produced to the Court documents answering that description but objected to their production to the applicant or the Crown on the basis of public interest immunity. The Commissioner advised the Court that he had no objection to the Court looking at the records so produced.
	
	
	In seeking the order against the Commissioner of Police for the production of the Police Source System records, the applicant relied upon two documents. The first was an Affidavit of Assistance prepared by Chief Inspector O, dated 29 September 2008. That document was prepared so that it could be used on behalf of 107A in sentence proceedings in the Local Court for two offences of making a false statement to obtain money. The amount involved in the two offences was $42,000. 107A was sentenced in the Local Court on 30 September 2008 and received a suspended sentence, a Community Service Order and was ordered to pay compensation of $68,700.
	
	
	The Affidavit of Assistance stated that 107A had been a police informant and had provided assistance to the police between 26 March 2008 and 1 August 2008. Various instances of such assistance were set out in the affidavit. Of relevance to these proceedings was the following:
	


“2   26 April 2008 – 107A assisted police with the investigation into the murder of Edward Spowart at Granville on 21 April 2008. 107A conveyed admissions made by the offender JB to investigating police and also obtained information in relation to the whereabouts of the offender’s clothing that he was wearing at the time of the offences leading to these items being recovered under a search warrant. This matter is still before the courts.”


	
	The applicant’s legal advisors obtained this document when they asked for and received a copy of the Local Court file relating to these offences.
	
	
	The second document upon which the applicant relied was an affidavit of M, who in 2008 was a Detective Sergeant of Police and the officer in charge of the investigation into the murder of Edward Spowart. M resigned from the police service in 2010. He swore his affidavit on 18 March 2015. The paragraphs relied upon by the applicant were paragraphs 6 and 7 which contained the following:
	


“6   On 23rd April, 2008, I was contacted by 107A who told me he was going to Cobham Juvenile Justice Centre to speak with ""JB”. He asked if there was anything I would like him to discuss with ""JB"". I told him we still had not recovered the murder weapon or the clothing of ""JB"". 107A then asked if we could give him a lift to the Juvenile Detention Centre. I arranged for Detective F to drive him to Cobham Juvenile Detention Centre. Following the meeting with ""JB"", I spoke by phone with Detective F who stated words to the effect ""nothing we didn't already know came from the meeting. He didn't say where the knife was"". Later that afternoon I had a phone conversation with 107A where he told me that ""JB"" had told him the clothes he was wearing on the night of the murder were at an address in Rooty Hill. During this phone conversation he disclosed to me that he was a police informant for a police officer at Blacktown Police station. Prior to this, I had no knowledge that 107A was a registered police informant. I did not recruit or register him as an informant myself and at no time did I indicate to 107A that I considered him an informant for myself. There is a strict process in registering an informant and this process was not conducted by myself. I did not consider him as ""my"" informant.

7   Once I learned 107A was an informant, out of courtesy, I contacted his handler, Chief Inspector O. I indicated to him that 107A had advised me he was an informant and I told him of the interactions we had with 107A. Inspector O stated he would give me access to the source system so that any future dealings with 107A could be recorded if I decided to use him as an informant for this investigation. I recall being given access and I know that an entry relating to the visit at Cobham on 23rd April was made, however, I do not recall if I made the entry myself or it was made by Chief Inspector O. As I am no longer in the NSW Police Force I do not have access to that system to confirm who made the entry. Furthermore, 107A was not utilized by me as a police informant, so no other entries were made on the source system by me.”


	
	That affidavit had been served on the applicant’s legal advisers by the Crown for possible use in these proceedings. At the time of this application, the affidavit had not been read by the Crown.
	
	
	Other evidence that may be relied on by the Crown, should there be a new trial, includes admissions said to have been made by the Applicant to an “accomplice”, Mr Ringo Madut and other evidence of the circumstances of the affray during which the deceased was stabbed to death. In considering the strength of the remaining Crown case, the credibility of Madut naturally arises. One of the witnesses (“C”) had given evidence in the trial that, when the group of which Madut was one fled from the scene after the affray, Madut threw a knife over a fence. Madut’s evidence, given later, was to the effect that he had been told the day before he gave evidence about C’s evidence. As was submitted by the applicant, this (if true) forewarned Madut of evidence that supported the applicant’s case that he was innocent of stabbing the deceased and that it was in fact Madut who had a knife that night.
	
	
	Not surprisingly, the applicant seeks a copy of the original conference notes between the Crown and Madut. The fact that Madut had a knife, if true, or perhaps even if he was aware that it is alleged that he did have a knife, would be relevant in assessing the credibility of his evidence implicating the applicant. The applicant also seeks production of all communications or correspondence relating to the witness 107A.
	
	
	The relevant emails are between Mr T Thorpe, the Prosecutor and Ms Davis, his Instructing Officer. By far the greater proportion have been disclosed without redaction. Some have been edited to remove material covered by legal professional privilege. Unredacted copies were produced to the Court to enable the issue of legal professional privilege to be considered. The conference notes, as such, are not subject to any claim for privilege.
	


Submissions


	
	No submissions were made in reliance upon s 130 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The submissions were based on common law principles. There was no issue that the Commissioner of Police was the party required to produce the relevant documents and also the party objecting to their production.
	
	
	The Commissioner restated the importance of the protection against disclosure extended to a police informant as a matter of public policy. The Court was referred to the statements of principle by McHugh JA in Cain v Glass (No 2) (1985) 3 NSWLR 230 at 233 – 234, 242, 246 – 247. The Commissioner, however, also acknowledged the exception where disclosure of the identity of an informant will be ordered by a court when required to establish the innocence of an accused person. The Commissioner accepted that such an exception had been made out in this case where the identity of 107A and the fact that he had been an informant at the relevant time, was essential to establishing the innocence of the applicant.
	
	
	Implicit in that concession would seem to be an acknowledgment that that part of the Police Source System records which contained the entry or entries relating to the murder of Edward Spowart and any assistance provided by 107A should be produced to the applicant.
	
	
	The Commissioner objected to producing those parts of the Police Source System records which related to other matters in which 107A had provided assistance to the police. The Commissioner submitted that just because 107A had been revealed as an informant in respect of the Spowart matter, did not entitle the applicant to know that he had helped in other matters, the details of those other matters and the nature of the help which was provided. In that regard the Commissioner relied upon the Attorney General for NSW v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667; a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal comprising Hunt CJ at CL; Smart and Studdert JJ.
	
	
	The Commissioner submitted that such disclosure would increase the risk to 107A and would increase the deterrent effect that the informant rule was designed to avoid, i.e. one of the primary reasons for protecting informants was to ensure the flow of information and intelligence to law enforcement authorities in the future. The Commissioner submitted that it was obvious that if an informant was exposed as having given evidence in other matters, that would have a tendency to deter other people from helping the police in the future.
	
	
	The Commissioner submitted that even before any weighing of the need for confidentiality against the asserted need for the applicant to have access to this material for the purposes of administering justice, the applicant had to establish a legitimate forensic purpose for the production of that material. In that regard, the Commissioner relied upon what Hunt CJ at CL said in Attorney General for NSW v Stuart at 681E:
	


“The third matter upon which the Attorney General relies concerns the need for the party seeking access to documents to demonstrate a legitimate forensic purpose before any balancing exercise between the conflicting aspects of public interest can be undertaken. I earlier quoted authority for that need: Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Governor and Company of the Bank of England (at 1113 – 1114, 1129); Alister v The Queen (at 412, 414, 438). The concept of legitimate forensic purpose is not confined to claims of public interest immunity. It arises whenever a party seeks access to documents for which he has issued a subpoena; where objection is taken a party who is unable to show that it is at least “on the cards” that such documents will assist his case is not entitled to have access to such documents simply to see whether they may do so: R v Saleam (at 17 – 18). He is not entitled to conduct a fishing expedition. The need to show a legitimate forensic purpose arises even if the claim of public interest immunity fails. It is therefore a prerequisite before the balance required for that claim can be struck.”


	
	The Commissioner submitted that the only legitimate forensic purpose identified by the applicant was the possibility that production of the Police Source System records relating to 107A’s assistance in other matters would reveal that the investigating police officers (M and F) had full knowledge that 107A was an informant before he was taken to Cobham and placed with JB and that in effect they used him as an agent provocateur.
	
	
	The Commissioner submitted that there was nothing before the Court to show that it was “on the cards” that material of that kind was likely to be found within the Police Source System records relating to 107A. It was nothing more than speculation to make such an assertion. The Commissioner submitted that even if it were “on the cards” that such material might be found in the Police Source System records, it had not been established how such material would help show that an acquittal, as distinct from a retrial, should be ordered. This was because misconduct on the part of the investigating police officers of the kind alleged, even if established, would not make the applicant’s position any stronger on this issue.
	
	
	The Commissioner submitted that even if the Court was satisfied that the applicant had established a legitimate forensic purpose for having access to those records, it would not find that the applicant could satisfy the required balancing test. The Commissioner submitted that when the utility of access to the Police Source System records relating to other instances when 107A had provided information to the police was weighed against the very important principle that informants were to be protected, so as to not only protect the informants themselves but to ensure a continuous flow of information, the balance would favour the non production of the documents.
	
	
	The Commissioner submitted that should the Court order that the records be produced, there should be a suppression order so that there was no reference to 107A’s role as an informant in respect of other matters outside the confines of the court. The Commissioner accepted that in such a circumstance, the precise terms of the suppression order could be agreed between the parties.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that it was clear from the Affidavit of Assistance and the Local Court documents relating to 107A, that he had received a significant benefit from being a police informant. Because one of the instances where 107A had provided assistance to the police involved obtaining admissions which led to the conviction of the applicant, the applicant was entitled to have access to the original source material, i.e. the records, so that he could find out the precise relationship between 107A and the police and in particular, the extent of the knowledge which Detectives M and F had concerning 107A’s activities at that time.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that it was clear from the affidavit of M that he had seen the records and that either he or Inspector O had made the relevant entry in those records. The applicant submitted that it was important for him to know what other material was in those records at the time that M had access to them. For example, did the records show that 107A was facing charges of his own and that he expected an affidavit or letter of assistance from the police in respect of those charges? The applicant submitted that the Police Source System records comprised documents which were fundamental to an assessment of the state of knowledge of M at the time of the investigation of the murder and when proceedings were commenced against him.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that it was “on the cards” that access to the records would show that the meeting between 107A and M leading to the attendance of 107A at Cobham as a support person was not merely fortuitous but was part of a deliberate police plan to interrogate and entrap him. The applicant submitted that such evidence was relevant because it would show the extent to which the investigation and Crown case against him were tainted. The applicant submitted that such matters were relevant to how the Court might exercise its discretion whether to order a retrial or enter a verdict of acquittal. The applicant submitted that if M were shown to be untruthful in the affidavit which had been filed by the Crown in these proceedings, that would also be a relevant discretionary consideration for the Court.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that it was necessary for him to see the records to find out whether they disclosed that 107A was facing charges of his own and that he had an expectation that by acting as an informant for the police, he would receive a benefit or discount as a result thereof. The applicant submitted that the extent of the knowledge of M and Detective F of 107A and his activities, was relevant to the Court assessing the extent of the miscarriage of justice which resulted in his conviction.
	
	
	In summary, the applicant submitted that the legitimate forensic purpose behind his request for access to the records was to determine the nature and extent to which the police investigation was tainted. He submitted that on the one hand, the factual situation might be as deposed by M but on the other, the extent of the police misconduct might have been much more serious involving not only an unfair “setting up” of himself, but a deliberate withholding of relevant evidence. He submitted that the nature and extent of the taint on the investigation was a matter relevant to the exercise of the Court’s discretion as to whether or not to enter a verdict of acquittal or order a retrial. In support of that proposition, the applicant relied upon the observations of Garling J in Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131; 224 A Crim R 22 at [698] where his Honour said:
	


“698   However, the conduct of the prosecuting authorities (which term I use to include the police and Director of Public Prosecutions) towards the applicant with the inevitable personal anxieties which it has caused and the raising of false hopes which it has created and which has continued over a lengthy period of time is of real significance. It tells strongly against ordering any further trial …”


	
	The Crown supported the submissions of the applicant and sought access to the Police Source System records relating to 107A. The Crown submitted that it would not be calling 107A on any retrial of the applicant. The Crown accepted that as soon as the prosecutor knew that 107A was a registered police informant, further inquiries should have been made. The Crown accepted that once Detective M became aware of that fact, he should have made further and fuller inquiries concerning 107A.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the only relevance of the records was the extent to which they demonstrated police or prosecutorial misconduct. The Crown accepted that an important issue was whether Detectives M and F knew at the time that they used 107A, on 22 April 2008, that he was a registered police informant, that he was being used as their agent and that his acting as a support person was a ruse. The Crown submitted that contrary to what the applicant asserted, it did not accept that those police officers had such knowledge at that time. For that reason, the Crown was happy for the applicant to have all relevant information from the Police Source System records because it would prove that those officers did not know that at the time 107A offered to assist as a support person, he was a registered informant. The Crown submitted that the issue that the records went to was the extent of the misconduct.
	
	
	So far as the documents subject to the claim of legal professional privilege are concerned, it is not disputed that (given the particular role of the Director of Public Prosecutions and those acting under his direction) the test whether the privilege applies is, essentially, determined by relevance. Accordingly, if the redacted material is relevant to the issues in the appeal, it is not covered by legal professional privilege since that privilege, in respect to the Director, must give way to the duty of disclosing material which is reasonably capable of assisting the defence.
	


Ruling as to Public Interest Immunity


	
	A preliminary difficulty in this matter is that the importance of the rationale behind the informant rule has been substantially weakened because at least some of the material in the Police Source System records concerning assistance provided by 107A on other occasions and in relation to other persons in addition to that concerning the murder of Edward Spowart, is set out in the Affidavit of Assistance to which the applicant has already had access. That being so, and given the concession by the Commissioner of Police concerning the entry in the records relating to 107A’s assistance with respect to the murder of Edward Spowart, we are of the opinion that that part of the Police Source System records relating to that entry should be produced. In that record, 107A’s identity is known and the nature of his assistance is also known.
	
	
	The entries relating to assistance provided to the police by 107A on other occasions is in a different category. We have difficulty in identifying the legitimate forensic purpose for which the records should be produced. As between the Crown and the applicant, a miscarriage of justice in the applicant’s conviction has been admitted. Not only that, the Crown has conceded that the police investigation miscarried in that proper and further inquiries were not made by the police when the investigating detectives learned that 107A was a registered police informant. The Crown has also acknowledged a significant failure by Crown law officers in that when the prosecution learned that its key witness was a registered police informant, it did not carry out further inquiries and did not provide that information to the defence.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it is difficult to see what further benefit could be gained by the applicant if in addition to those failures, it were to be established that the investigating police officers knew that 107A was a police informant before arranging for him to act as a support person for the applicant. It makes their conduct more serious but only as a matter of degree. The essential failure to properly investigate has already been established.
	
	
	If as the applicant submitted, the production of the records goes to discretionary considerations relating to whether or not a verdict of acquittal should be entered, the importance of whether the conduct of the investigating police officers should be regarded as a very serious dereliction of their duty as distinct from a serious dereliction is of marginal importance at best. In the context of this case, it is the miscarriage of justice arising from the officers of the Crown which is of significance, rather than the extent of the dereliction of duty by the investigating police officers. There is nothing in the observations of Garling J in Gilham to contrary effect.
	
	
	There is another difficulty with the applicant’s submissions. There is nothing other than assertion and speculation to support the proposition that “it is on the cards” that if the Police Source System records in respect of 107A relating to other matters were produced, they would reveal greater knowledge on the part of the investigating police officers than has been thus far disclosed, or that they would reveal that inducements in the nature of assistance in meeting the charges brought against him had been offered to 107A.
	
	
	It follows that we are not satisfied that the applicant has established a legitimate forensic purpose for requiring the production of the Police Source System records with respect to 107A in matters other than the murder of Edward Spowart.
	
	
	That is sufficient to deal with the applicant’s application. In the course of the hearing, however, the Commissioner invited the Court to inspect for itself the whole of the Police Source System records relating to 107A. Having done so, we are able to say that apart from the entry relating to the murder of Edward Spowart, there is no material in the records which would in any possible circumstances provide material assistance to the applicant with respect to the issue which he has identified, i.e. the exercise of the Court’s discretion as to whether or not to enter a verdict of acquittal.
	
	
	In an application of this kind for the production of documents, the Court would normally not take the step of inspecting the documents except in unusual circumstances such as occurred in the seminal case of Alister v The Queen [1984] HCA 85; 154 CLR 404. Given the unfortunate history of this case, and the fact that a miscarriage of justice occurred because appropriate inquiries were not made by relevant agencies, it is important that the applicant understand that documents, which might be relevant to his appeal, were not being kept from his legal advisers.
	


Ruling as to privilege


	
	We set out below the parts for which privilege is claimed but which should be disclosed. In some instances we have set out part of the text (already provided) to provide context. It should be said, in fairness, that some of the material which is the subject of the privilege claim is an opinion about how the witness will go in evidence. Such an opinion is not a relevant fact and the claim for privilege is upheld in respect of it. The small amount of material objected to which is capable of assisting the defence or giving rise to a line of enquiry and, accordingly, is not subject to privilege is set out in italics –
	


27 July 2009, Thorpe to Davis:

So at this stage it looks like one did Wundit, Chol and Madut are willing to plead to affray and give evidence. Have you spoken to the police any further about that possibility?

27 July 2009, Thorpe to Davis:

I don’t think there is anything arising from Dut at this stage… [privileged sentence] But if he is allowed to tell his story uninterrupted I guess he will get it out…But I am a bit concerned about whether he will get the bit out about the admission that JB made. [As in original.]

27 July 2009 M to Davis:

Crim history attached. How did you go with Dut??

Orders for production


	
	The Court orders:
	



	
	The Commissioner of Police to produce the Police Source System records relating to 107A to which Inspector O had access up to 1 September 2009
	
	
	The code numbers relating to 107A be redacted from the records so produced.
	
	
	Access is granted to the parties of that part of the produced documents that relate to 107A’s involvement in the investigation of the murder of Edward Spowart (to be marked for identification 1).
	



	
	McCALLUM J: I have read in draft the joint judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL and Adams J. I agree with the proposed ruling as to privilege, for the reasons their Honours have stated. With great respect to their Honours, I do not agree with their conclusion as to the Police Source System records.
	
	
	In my respectful opinion, the applicant has established a legitimate forensic purpose for requiring production of the documents sought, that is, all of the records with respect to 107A, not only those relating to the assistance he provided in respect of the murder of Edward Spowart. The applicant’s submissions have persuaded me that the prospective forensic assistance of such documents is beyond mere assertion or speculation. That is not to give in to scepticism as to the contents of M’s affidavit but merely to acknowledge that the obvious tension between 107A’s professed role as a support person for the applicant and the assistance he offered police is troubling and warrants comprehensive investigation.
	
	
	Contrary to the conclusion reached by the Chief Judge and Adams J, I am persuaded that the outcome of that investigation could (depending on what transpires) be of more than marginal importance in the determination whether to exercise the power contained in s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to order a new trial. That section confers a broad discretion which is to be exercised according to the interests of justice. A primary consideration is whether the remaining evidence given at the original trial was “sufficiently cogent to justify a conviction”: DPP (Nauru) v Fowler [1984] HCA 48; 154 CLR 627 at 630. The applicant will argue that it was not, and that an acquittal must follow (written submissions at para 185). But if that issue is determined against the applicant, the Court must also take into account “any circumstance that might render it unjust to the accused to make him stand trial again”: Fowler at 630.
	
	
	Considerations of any injustice to an accused of ordering a new trial are likely to be informed by the reason for quashing the conviction. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the precise facts of this case do not appear to have arisen previously for consideration in this context. Where the occasion for quashing a conviction is that the jury was misdirected by the trial judge, and there would be no change in the Crown case on a re-trial, the assessment is less complex, but even in that instance there is room for different views: see for example Peacock v R [1911] HCA 66; 13 CLR 619 at 641-644 per Griffiths CJ; cf at 659 per Barton J and 675 per O’Connor J.
	
	
	It is well established that a re-trial should not be ordered to allow the presentation of a new case which was not made at the first trial: R v Wilkes [1948] HCA 22; 77 CLR 511 at 518 per Dixon J, Rich and McTiernan JJ agreeing; Latham CJ dissenting. That is a species of unfairness. However, what constitutes a “new case” in that context is also the subject of different views: see for example R v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; 228 CLR 232 at [36] to [38] per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J; cf at [60] to [68] per Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ.
	
	
	In the present case, the conviction has been quashed due to a failure of the Crown to disclose material relating to the role of 107A and his relationship with police and a failure of police to disclose the fact that he had been given an affidavit of assistance prior to the trial. The Crown has indicated that it would not call 107A at any new trial but that is not necessarily the ambit of any unfairness flowing from those failures. In my view, the extent to which the path of the investigation which resulted in the charging of the applicant may have been tainted or influenced by the assistance volunteered by 107A and the extent of police awareness of his status as a registered informer could be relevant to the fairness of putting the applicant on trial a second time. On my reading of the authorities, that would be a proper consideration in the exercise of the Court’s discretionary power under s 8(1).
	
	
	As noted in the joint judgment, the Crown has made a concession that the police investigation miscarried in that proper and further inquiries were not made when it was learned that 107A was a registered informant. However, in my respectful opinion, the interests of justice and, in particular, the consideration of any injustice to the accused of ordering a new trial may be informed by considerations beyond that bare concession. The fairness of ordering a new trial is not simply a question of removing 107A from the Crown’s witness list and assessing the cogency of what remains. In my view, the applicant is entitled to investigate for himself what would or might have been revealed had proper inquiry been made during the investigation or indeed at any point before the first trial.
	
	
	Having regard to the importance of that issue, I consider that the interests of justice weigh in favour of ordering the production of all of the documents sought (with an appropriate suppression order). In light of that conclusion, I have not inspected the documents myself. I consider it preferable to leave the task of assessing their significance to the applicant’s legal advisors.
	
	
	In lieu of the order proposed in the joint judgment, the order I would have made is that the Commissioner of Police produce all of the Police Source System records relating to 107A to which Inspector O had access up to 1 September 2009.

2425452,New South Wales Crime Commission v Taylor [2015] NSWSC 946,"Judgment


	
	This is an application for orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW). Section 10A enables an application to be made ex-parte for a restraining order which remains in force while there is an application pending for an order under s 27 of the Act.
	
	
	The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 14 July 2015. Mr Spark deposes to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in serious crime related activity or activities, namely the supply of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and the supply of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). Both of those offences are serious criminal offences as defined in s 6(2)(b) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act.
	
	
	Mr Spark's suspicion is based chiefly on the reading of a facts sheet prepared in relation to the investigation and arrest of the Defendant. Mr Spark emailed the officer who prepared the facts sheet to obtain confirmation from him that he had in fact drafted the facts sheet, that to the best of the officer's knowledge and belief the contents of the facts sheet were true, and that the facts sheet was prepared based on information obtained by the police as a result of the investigation set out in the facts sheet. The police officer concerned provided an email to Mr Spark containing affirmative answers to Mr Spark's question.
	
	
	I have read the facts sheet and I am satisfied from the material contained in it that Mr Spark's suspicion of serious crime related activity is held on reasonable grounds. I am further satisfied under s 10A(3) of the Act that the Defendant is both domiciled in New South Wales and that the property sought to be restrained is in New South Wales.
	
	
	Section 10A(4) enables notice to be given to the Defendant before the order is made, if the Court thinks fit. In the light of Mr Spark's evidence concerning the manner and speed with which property can be disposed of or transferred, I do not consider that the Defendant should be given notice of this application before an order is made. The Defendant has rights under s 10C of the Act to a review of these orders.
	
	
	I note the usual undertaking as to damages is given. I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 of the draft Order provided to me. I grant the leave contained in paragraph 4 and liberty is granted pursuant to paragraph 6 of those orders. The orders are to be entered forthwith.

2425453,New South Wales Crime Commission v Shen [2015] NSWSC 947,"Judgment


	
	This is an application for orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW). Section 10A enables an application to be made ex-parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst there is an application under section 27 of the Act.
	
	
	The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 15 July 2015. In that affidavit Mr Spark swears to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity or activities as defined in s 6 of the Act, namely taking part in the manufacture or production of a prohibited drug, being MDMA, contrary to s 24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), and supply of a prohibited drug, being MDMA, contrary to s 25(2) of that Act. Both of those offences are serious criminal offences as defined in s 6(2)(b) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act.
	
	
	Mr Spark's suspicion is held on the basis of information contained in a facts sheet obtained by him from the investigating officer. Mr Spark deposes to the fact that he forwarded an email to that officer asking him if he drafted the facts sheet, if to the best of the officer's knowledge and belief the contents of the facts sheet were true, and if the facts sheet was prepared on information obtained by the police as a result of the investigation described in the facts sheet. The officer answered in the affirmative to all of those questions.
	
	
	Having read the material contained in the facts sheet I am satisfied that Mr Spark's suspicion of the Defendant engaging in serious crime related activity is held on reasonable grounds.
	
	
	I am also satisfied pursuant to s 10A(3) of the Act that the Defendant is domiciled in New South Wales and that the property sought to be restrained is in New South Wales.
	
	
	Section 10A(4) of the Act enables notice to be given to the Defendant before the order is made if the Court thinks fit. Mr Spark gives evidence, based on his long experience in his position, of the manner and speed with which property can be disposed of or transferred. In those circumstances I do not consider it is necessary or appropriate that notice should be given to the Defendant before this order is made. In any event, the Defendant has the rights accorded to him for review under s 10C of the Act.
	
	
	I note also that the Plaintiff claims an order under s 12 of the Act varying the interests in the property to which the restraining order relates. Such order is sought to permit the Defendant to sell the property but nevertheless for the net proceeds of sale after payment of the various amounts specified in paragraph 3 of the summons to be restrained.
	
	
	I note the usual undertaking as to damages is given. Accordingly, I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 6, 8, 10 and 11 of the draft order. I grant the leave in paragraph 7 and the liberty in paragraph 9 of that order.

		16 July 2015",2015-07-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2425554,R v Castaneda (No. 3) [2015] NSWSC 1104,"Judgment


	
	On 15 July 2015 the accused was arraigned before a jury panel on an indictment charging her with the murder of Gregory Peck, on 22 February 2013, at Cecil Hills in the State of New South Wales.
	
	
	On 21 July 2015, at the end of the Crown case, I acceded to an application from her to direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty to that charge. I declined an application to give the jury a direction in accordance with R v Prasad (1979) 2 A Crim R 45; (1979) 23 SASR 161, with respect to the alternative charge of manslaughter.
	
	
	These are my reasons for those decisions.
	
	
	This is a case in which the issue of self-defence has always loomed large. The Crown case in summary is that, after an argument between the accused and the deceased, her de facto partner, at the couple’s home on the late evening of 22 February 2013, the accused inflicted a single stab wound to Mr. Peck’s chest. The wound penetrated some fifteen centimetres into the body, penetrating Mr. Peck’s heart. The wound was of a type that was unlikely to be survivable, even if medical treatment had been rendered immediately. Although the accused immediately contacted the triple 0 emergency operator, and ambulance officers arrived at the location very quickly, Mr. Peck was declared dead at 12.30am on 23 February 2013 after his arrival at hospital.
	
	
	The accused was arrested at the scene and taken to the Green Valley Police Station. She was subsequently charged with Mr. Peck’s murder.
	
	
	The Crown opened its case to the jury in this way.
	


“The issue for you in this trial will ultimately be twofold. The issue will be why did she stab him and was it done in self-defence. Or on the Crown case, was it done in retaliation for the dispute; the argument that had been taking place, and in earlier actions by the deceased towards Ms Castaneda.” (T65:39 - 43).

[…]

Ms Castaneda spoke to the triple-0 operator when she called for assistance shortly after she stabbed Mr Peck and I expect you’ll hear that version this afternoon. She also spoke with police who attended shortly afterwards and she gave an account to them of what happened. I expect you’ll also hear that account this afternoon.

It’s those two accounts; the first given to the triple-0 operator over the telephone and the second to police officers who first attended that will be the primary focus of your consideration of the issues in this trial (T65:48 – T66:07).

[…]

It’s the Crown case that when you consider what she told the triple 0 operators and then what she subsequently told the police officers at the house, and then what she later told her former husband about what had happened. When you compare those you will see that there’s a distinction or a difference between the accounts. The first account was that she thought he was going to hit her, the latter account was that he had taken her by the throat and then released her and then she’d got the knife and following that had stabbed him (T68:47 – T69:03).

[…]

It’s the Crown case that albeit it was during or after an argument between Ms Castaneda and the deceased, in circumstances where the deceased had been drinking heavily, at their home on the Friday evening, that Ms Castaneda did not act genuinely in self-defence when she stabbed the accused, but did so in retaliation or because of having been provoked in the lay sense of having been angered by what had happened to her shortly before that, and had happened to her in this argument that they were having about their intended, but postponed, wedding in the circumstances of their relationship (T71:43 – T71:50).”


	
	It was the Crown’s contention that it would prove to the requisite standard that the accused stabbed Mr. Peck, not in self-defence but in retaliation or in anger, which has not been borne out by the evidence.
	
	
	In support of the application for a directed verdict Mr. Strickland, senior counsel for the accused, referred to particular aspects of the evidence led in the Crown case which raised the issue of self-defence, something which he submitted the Crown had failed to negative.
	


The Evidence


	
	The evidence of Dr. Johan Duflou, the forensic pathologist who examined Mr. Peck post mortem, was that Mr. Peck died as a consequence of a single stab wound to the left side of the chest, which passed from the front of the body, through the cartilage of the fourth rib, through the upper lobe of the left lung, and through the heart, ending in the lower lobe of the left lung. The wound tracked slightly downwards and slightly to the left, although its path relevant to a body in motion as opposed to rigidly upright could not be determined.
	
	
	Such a wound when inflicted by a knife with a sharp point, as was the case here, would require a minor amount of force. If the deceased had been moving forward towards the accused at the time, it may have been inflicted with no force used by the accused (T291:23). The depth of the wound could be accounted for, at least partially, by the deceased falling onto a table with the knife in his chest, causing deeper penetration, a scenario put to and accepted by Dr. Duflou as a reasonable possibility (T292:38).
	
	
	Dr. Duflou noted some other, trivial injuries, but these appear to have no particular relevance.
	
	
	The deceased had a blood alcohol level of about 0.15 grams per 100 millilitres, a figure familiar as the high range prescribed concentration of alcohol. He also had a condition commonly known as “fatty liver” which is frequently associated with the excessive consumption of alcohol over an extended period.
	
	
	In a telephone call to a triple 0 emergency operator shortly before 11.42 on the evening of 22 February 2013 the accused told the operator,
	


“My partner went to hit me and I grabbed the knife and I, I, I, I. I stabbed him (Ex. B, p.1).”


	
	She later said,
	


“I did it ‘cause he was trying to hit me and I got scared.” (ibid, p.7)


	
	In the recording of the call played to the jury the accused’s state of distress was plain. She repeatedly asked the operator to help her, and repeatedly asked that the ambulance hurry. At one point, in the context of some instruction from the operator concerning first aid, Ms. Castaneda told the operator,
	


“He’s been drinking all night, does that matter.” (ibid, p.3)


	
	During the conversation she also said,
	


“Oh my god, I didn’t mean to, I didn’t mean to do this.” (ibid, p.4).


	
	The first police to arrive at the Cecil Hills address were Senior Constable Gavin Richardson and Constable Sarah McMurtrie. The officers arrived at 11.51 that night. They could hear a woman’s voice calling for help. They saw the accused at the rear of the premises on a patio area kneeling beside Mr. Peck, holding a bloody towel to his chest.
	
	
	Constable McMurtrie asked the accused where the knife was, and she indicated its location, on the grass in the back garden. When asked who had stabbed Mr. Peck she said, “I did” (T102:45). She also said,
	


“He was coming at me. I got scared, so I went like that.” (T103:01).


	
	In saying “that”, the accused demonstrated a motion to the officer, replicated by Constable McMurtrie in evidence, where her left arm was held up with her left hand held palm outwards in a gesture such as that used by a police officer when signalling to traffic to stop. Her right hand was held in a fist as if clasped around something, at about chin level, with the hand advancing in a slightly forwards motion. This demonstrated the movement, holding a knife, Ex. F, that led to the infliction of the fatal wound.
	
	
	To Senior Constable Richardson, the accused said that she and Mr. Peck had been in the kitchen arguing. She said,
	


“[…] he tried to choke me. I defended myself and he stumbled out here [the rear patio area] and knocked over the glass, then he went up the side.” (T121:16 – 19).


	
	She later added,
	


“We were having an argument and he came up to me. He grabbed me by the throat.” (T123:20).


	
	The balance of the conversation was recorded by another officer on a mobile telephone. The recording and a transcript were tendered as Ex. C. The accused told Senior Constable Richardson,
	


“We were arguing and he grabbed me by the throat, and then I ran back here and then he’s like, ‘Don’t fucking start with me’. I go, ‘You need to get away from me,’ and I grabbed the knife and he goes, ‘Aw, you want to do this.’ He went around and then he got close to me, and I just hit him, and then he stumbled out, hit the table and then went to the floor, and I was like, ‘oh my God’, and then I called the police.”


	
	The accused was arrested, taken to Green Valley Police Station, and admitted into custody. She asked officers there to contact her former husband on her behalf, and David Jancovic subsequently attended the police station and sat with the accused. She told him,
	


“I was on the computer and we were arguing about the wedding. I wanted to call it off. He started choking me. When he let go I got up and went to the kitchen. I grabbed a knife. I was really scared.’ She said ‘all I wanted to do was keep him away. He came towards me and I was trying to keep him away. Somehow the knife ended up in his shoulder. I didn’t mean to stab him. He stumbled back, then he walked outside and collapsed. I rang the ambulance straight away and tried to stop the bleeding.”


	
	Mr. Jancovic saw an injury to Ms. Castaneda’s forehead.
	
	
	Consistent with Ms. Castaneda’s claim that the deceased had his hands on her throat choking her prior to the stabbing was evidence from Clinton Cochrane, a senior forensic biologist who examined various samples from the crime scene, the deceased, and the accused. Mr. Cochrane extracted DNA from a swab taken from the accused’s neck and found it to be a mixture of the DNA of two individuals. The major component of the mixture was, as might be expected, DNA consistent with that of the accused. The minor component was DNA consistent with that of the deceased.
	
	
	Mr. Cochrane deposed that one method by which the deceased’s DNA could have been deposited on the accused’s neck was by contact between the deceased’s hands and the accused’s neck, leaving skin cells behind. Because skin cells are not a high yielding source of DNA, a degree of friction or the forceful or prolonged application of the deceased’s hands would be necessary to deposit the amount of DNA found there. Alternatively, Mr. Cochrane said it was possible that DNA could have been deposited at the high level noted, by the accused touching her neck and thereby transferring the deceased’s blood from her hands to her neck. Mr. Cochrane deposed that this route of deposition was possible even where no blood was visible on the neck where it was swabbed, as was the case here.
	
	
	In photographs which are part of Ex. A, areas of discolouration can be seen on the accused’s neck. Photograph 29 of Ex. A appears to show an area of mottled skin on the right side of the accused’s throat, whilst photograph 30 shows an area of redness on the left side of her throat, at about the level of the top of the shoulders. These photographs of the accused were taken by police at around 8.15 on the morning of 23 February 2013.
	
	
	There was evidence in the Crown case of acts of previous violence to which the accused was subjected by the deceased.
	
	
	In March 2010 there had been a violent argument between the couple, and the deceased had placed the accused into what he referred to as a “sleeper hold”. According to Dr. Duflou a sleeper hold is where the victim’s neck is placed between the forearm and the upper arm of the person administering the hold, such that the victim’s neck is wedged into the inner crook of the arm. Such a hold can lead to unconsciousness within ten to fifteen seconds, and there is a risk of death (T293 – 294).
	
	
	The police had been called to this incident and the deceased had acknowledged placing the accused into a sleeper hold, he said to restrain her when she hit him. Senior Constable Alice Kula saw an injury to the accused’s neck and knee, and photographs were taken (Ex. 4). A statement was obtained from the accused, and details of her statement were given in evidence (T306 – 307). Her allegation against the deceased included an allegation that he had choked her to the point where she felt unable to breathe. The deceased was arrested by police but later released without charge. An interim Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (“ADVO”) was obtained by the police for the accused’s protection.
	
	
	On 2 September 2012 the police were again called to attend the accused’s shared residence with the deceased. Although it was the deceased who contacted police on that occasion, when Constable Michael Johns arrived at the scene at about 2.30 that morning his observations of Mr. Peck were such that he sought and obtained an interim ADVO for the protection of the accused. A copy of the order was tendered as Ex. 2.
	
	
	Constable Johns deposed that the deceased was intoxicated; he smelled of alcohol and was unsteady on his feet. Mr. Peck told the officer that the accused had given him “a soft push” (T228:38). He said there had been an argument about the television being too loud, at a time when the deceased was watching grid iron football.
	
	
	The accused told Constable Johns,
	


“I’m scared of him when he drinks. I don’t know what he might do. I’m worried that one day he might hurt me.” (T229:08)


	
	The accused also expressed her concerns about the increased consumption of alcohol by the deceased.
	
	
	There was additional evidence as to the accused’s accounts to others, such as Mr. Peck’s maternal aunt, of his heavy drinking and repeated acts of violence towards her. She had made complaint from time to time to her former husband, the police, and Judy Carr.
	
	
	There was other evidence of the deceased’s acts of violence towards a former girlfriend, Ms. Lucas. This evidence was admitted because Ms. Lucas had, in e-mail and Facebook messages, told the accused that the deceased had been violent and abusive to her during the course of their relationship. It was also relied upon by the accused to establish a tendency of the deceased to violence towards his partners when drinking.
	


The Applications


	
	It was Mr. Strickland’s submission that there was nothing in the evidence led by the Crown which was capable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had not acted lawfully, in that the issue of self-defence within the meaning of s.418 of the Crimes Act 1900 had been raised but not negatived.
	
	
	It was submitted that the Crown had failed to establish each element of the charge of murder, and the accused was entitled to a verdict of not guilty with respect to that charge.
	
	
	Mr. Strickland submitted that a Prasad direction relevant to both murder (should the application for a directed verdict fail) and manslaughter should be given in any event.
	
	
	The Crown opposed the applications. With respect to the application for a directed verdict for murder, the Crown argued that the evidence capable of negativing the s.418 issue was to be found in the purported differences in the accounts of the stabbing given by the accused to various individuals. The Crown contended that the versions given to the emergency operator, to Senior Constable Richardson, and to Mr. Jancovic were very different, and the differences, of themselves, negatived self-defence.
	


Consideration


	
	A trial judge must direct a jury to acquit an accused person if, at the conclusion of the Crown case, the evidence is as a matter of law incapable of proving the offence charged. A jury may only be directed to return a verdict of not guilty if there is a defect in the evidence advanced in support of a finding of guilt which is such that, taken at its highest, the evidence will not sustain a verdict of guilty: Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207; R v LK [2010] HCA 17; 241 CLR 177.
	
	
	A directed verdict cannot be given simply because the trial judge views the evidence as unsatisfactory, or considers that a verdict of guilty would be unsafe: R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 at 85.
	
	
	The principles set out in Doney at 214 – 215 are,
	


""It follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.

It is necessary only to observe that neither the power of a court of criminal appeal to set aside a verdict that is unsafe or unsatisfactory nor the inherent power of a court to prevent an abuse of process provides any basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function. The power of a court of criminal appeal to set aside a verdict on the ground that it is unsafe or unsatisfactory, like other appellate powers, is supervisory in nature. Its application to the fact-finding function of a jury does not involve an interference with the traditional division of functions between judge and jury in a criminal trial.""


	
	The charge of murder alleged against the accused requires the Crown to prove that, at the place and on the date averred,
	



	
	The accused did a deliberate act which caused the death of Gregory Peck;
	
	
	When she did that act, the accused intended to kill Mr. Peck or to cause him grievous bodily harm (reckless indifference not being relied upon by the Crown); and
	
	
	That the accused’s act was done without lawful excuse.
	



	
	The accused does not dispute the first element.
	
	
	Although she disputes the second element, and contends – as she told the emergency operator – that she did not mean to stab Mr. Peck, the act itself in these circumstances is evidence which could establish that element of the charge. It is open to the jury to infer the necessary intent from the act of striking out at the chest area or upper body of another person when armed with a large and very sharp knife.
	
	
	It is the third element where the evidence falls short, as the accused contends.
	
	
	Section 418 of the Crimes Act 1900 provides, relevantly,
	


418 Self-defence—when available

(1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self-defence.

(2) A person carries out conduct in self-defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary:

(a) to defend himself or herself or another person, or

(b) […]

(c) […]

(d) […]

and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them.


	
	Self-defence will be negatived where the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that either,
	



	
	The accused did not believe at the time of the act causing death that it was necessary to do what she did in order to defend herself, or that
	
	
	The act was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as the accused perceived them to be.
	



	
	In the call to the emergency operator, Ex. B, the accused raised the issue of self-defence, within what must have been no more than seconds to a minute of the stabbing, telling the operator that she acted from fear, believing her partner was going to hit her. The detail given to the operator was brief, and in response to questions from the operator. It is clear from listening to the conversation that the accused’s primary concern was for Mr. Peck, and to do what she could to get aid to him as quickly as possible. The account she gave of the stabbing was neither thorough nor considered.
	
	
	The account to Senior Constable Richardson is not different to the account to the Triple 0 operator; it simply adds detail, again in response to questions. This conversation reflects its different purposes rather than revealing anything which could of itself or in combination with other evidence negative self-defence. Unlike the emergency operator, whose focus was on the patient, and keeping the caller calm, the police officer was seeking information as to what had happened and why. He asked questions directed to obtaining that information, as well as directed to keeping the accused as calm as was possible given what he believed to be the state of shock that she was in (T127:05). Senior Constable Richardson obtained greater detail than did the operator as to the circumstances surrounding the stabbing, but the detail was not inconsistent with that given to the emergency operator. The greater detail simply added to and developed the issue of self-defence.
	
	
	In her conversation with her former husband, some relatively short time later, at Green Valley police station, the accused gave an account that was not identical in its terms to those to the emergency operator or Senior Constable Richardson but, again, nothing she said to Mr. Jancovic was inconsistent with or different to her earlier accounts of the stabbing. The context and circumstances of this third conversation were different to the previous conversations; here, Ms. Castaneda was speaking with someone close to her for solace, rather than answering an official’s questions. Mr. Jancovic did not record the conversation in any way, and gave his account of it as his best recollection of what was said.
	
	
	In my judgment, the account given by the accused to her ex-husband was not in any way inconsistent with the earlier accounts; it was simply a partial account of the incident.
	
	
	The differing level of information provided to the persons to whom the accused spoke in the period immediately after the stabbing cannot rebut self-defence; to the contrary, it is these assertions by Ms. Castaneda, in conjunction with the other evidence of earlier acts of violence by the deceased towards Ms. Castaneda that raises self-defence so prominently.
	
	
	The Crown emphasised the accused’s recounted act of getting a knife and submitted that such an act was not done in self-defence.
	


“My submission is that there is sufficient evidence, given the demonstration, given the claim that he had choked her and subsequently she went and got the knife, the knife was not taken up in response to being choked, it was taken up after having been choked and the knife was not taken up where she was in fear of being hit but rather after she had been choked, as she put it.”


	
	I do not accept that submission because it presupposes that this event occurred in instalments, rather than as a rapidly devolving and fluid incident. There was, on the evidence, no break in either time or atmosphere that means that the accused’s act of taking up a knife should be seen divorced from what had gone before, that being on the evidence both a physical assault and the threat by conduct of a further assault. The incident involved continuous action, with no temporal gap between the deceased’s act (as recounted by the accused) of choking her and the stabbing, and no lessening in the pervasive atmosphere of threat that was perceived by the accused and conveyed by her to those with whom she spoke.
	
	
	On the whole of the evidence led in the Crown case, the knife was taken up as a direct response to the deceased’s act of choking the accused, and from fear that more was to come. There is simply no evidence to sustain the Crown’s opening comments to the jury that the evidence would establish that the accused stabbed the deceased in anger, or as retaliation after all danger had passed.
	
	
	Having considered the evidence very carefully, and even taking the Crown case at its highest as one must, I am unable to identify any evidence capable of negativing the self-defence issue by proving beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was not acting in her own defence, as contemplated by s.418 of the Crimes Act 1900. Other than the asserted “differences” in the accounts given by the accused to others, the Crown can point to none.
	
	
	The Crown having opened on the common law alternative of manslaughter, on the basis of what is generally referred to as excessive self-defence, that charge remains for the jury’s consideration and determination.
	
	
	Mr. Strickland asked for a Prasad direction to be given in relation to that charge.
	
	
	Such a direction is a direction to the jury that a verdict of not guilty can be returned at any time after the close of the Crown case without hearing any further evidence, or the addresses of counsel and the summing up by the trial judge. It is a direction rarely given, and generally only where there is significant fragility to the Crown case.
	


“It is, of course, open to the jury at any time after the close of the case for the prosecution to inform the judge that the evidence which they have heard is insufficient to justify a conviction and to bring in a verdict of not guilty without hearing more. It is within the discretion of the judge to inform the jury of this right, and if he decides to do so he usually tells them at the close of the case for the prosecution that they may exercise the right then or at any later stage of the proceedings, Archbold Criminal Pleading & Practice (39th ed., 1976) p. 332. He may undoubtedly, if he sees fit, advise them to stop the case and bring in a verdict of not guilty: R v Prasad per King CJ at p.163.”


	
	I do not regard this as a case where a Prasad direction should be given.
	
	
	I do not consider the Crown case to be a compelling one in any sense, but nor is it as frail and lacking in cogency as would militate in favour of the direction (or invitation, as it is sometimes termed) being given.
	
	
	Additionally, concepts of self-defence and the reasonableness of the degree of force employed in response and the like are, in my opinion, not straightforward or, perhaps more properly, they are made complex by the way in which the law defines and applies them. The jury will in my view benefit from the addresses and summing up, even if there is no further evidence.
	
	
	On that basis I declined to give the Prasad direction to the jury.

2425687,Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Gow [2015] NSWCCA 208,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: On 12 December 2014 McClintock DCJ sentenced the respondent for an offence under the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) of importing a commercial quantity of cocaine. He was sentenced to eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years.
	
	
	Although the sentence was imposed in the exercise of federal jurisdiction, the Commonwealth Director is entitled to appeal as of right against sentence, pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). [1]  The sole ground identified in a notice of appeal filed on 12 January 2015 was that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	Section 5D(1) has the dual functions of conferring power to appeal on the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions and providing that the Court “may in its discretion vary the sentence and impose such sentence as to the said court may seem proper.” That confers a discretionary power. It has long been established, as with respect to an appeal by an offender, that the general constraints on appellate intervention apply. As explained in House v The King, [2]  it is necessary for the appellant to demonstrate that an error has been made in exercising the discretionary power. Absent demonstration that the judge has acted upon a wrong principle, taken into account extraneous or irrelevant considerations, mistaken the facts or failed to take some material consideration into account, the appellate court may only intervene if satisfied that the order is such that “upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust”, and that a failure to exercise the power according to law may be inferred.
	
	
	In relation to an appeal by the prosecutor, there may be some awkwardness in characterising a result as “unjust”, being a term more commonly applied to the situation of an individual. That matter highlights the important difference between an appeal brought by an offender and one brought by the prosecutor, in relation to a sentence. Thus, although there is a public interest in each offender being sentenced according to correct legal principle, there is also an individual interest in avoiding a manifestly excessive sentence. As explained in Green v The Queen [3]  and recently affirmed in the joint reasons of Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ in CMB v The Queen, [4]  “offender appeals being concerned with the correction of error in a particular case and prosecution appeals being concerned with laying down principles for the guidance of sentencing courts”, the purpose underlying appellate intervention differs and the circumstances in which it occurs must differ. Thus, this Court should not intervene to increase a sentence unless persuaded by the Director that that course is appropriate for the proper performance of the Court’s statutory function, such as establishing a matter of principle. [5]  In Everett v The Queen [6]  the joint reasons stated that the reference by Barwick CJ in Griffiths to establishing “’some matter of principle’… must be understood as encompassing what is necessary to avoid the kind of manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing standards which Barwick CJ saw as constituting ‘error in point of principle’.”
	
	
	In Munda v State of Western Australia, [7]  the joint reasons referred to that passage in Everett as encompassing “the avoidance of manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing standards.” [8]  Although the language in Everett (“what is necessary to avoid”) has been reduced to “the avoidance of”, citation of both in CMB indicates that no diminution was intended of the standard to be applied in determining whether or not to intervene. The public purpose of a prosecution appeal has been described as a “limiting purpose”. [9]  In any event, the identification of error is a precondition to the engagement of the power.
	


Identification of error


	
	The Director did not seek to establish some specific error of principle, extraneous consideration or failure to take into account a relevant matter. Rather he submitted that the sentence was manifestly inadequate “in all the circumstances given the objective seriousness of the offending, the maximum penalty, the lack of any substantial mitigation and the need for general deterrence.” [10]  The judge had, it was further submitted, “impermissibly departed from the yardstick sentencing guidance provided by this Court and other intermediate appeal courts for similar offending”. [11] 
	
	
	The maximum penalty was life imprisonment and a possible fine of $1.275 million. No fine was imposed, but there was no complaint about that. Nor was it said that the trial judge was not cognisant of the maximum penalty: he expressly referred to it and was undoubtedly aware of its severity. No doubt there was a need for general deterrence to be reflected in an appropriate sentence, as indeed there was a need for a sufficient sentence to constitute significant personal deterrence. But there was no suggestion that the judge treated these or other standard factors as inapplicable.
	
	
	It may also be noted that the judge was aware of what the Director described as “the lack of any substantial mitigation”. Reference will be made to the express findings in that regard shortly. It may also be said that the judge was fully cognisant of the objective seriousness of the offending and the culpability of the offender: his reasons set out the elements of the offending in some detail.
	
	
	In the end, the Director’s submissions must stand or fall on the proposition that the sentence was manifestly out of line with the range of sentences generally imposed for similar offending. Before addressing that submission, it is convenient to identify the circumstances of the offending as summarised by the sentencing judge.
	


Circumstances of offending


	
	The importation involved packages of cocaine weighing just over 4 kg, constituting 2.3 kg of pure cocaine. (A commercial quantity is 2 kg.) The drug was contained in four packages, one in each of four computer towers, secreted where the compact disc or digital versatile disc drive should have been. [12]  The drugs were discovered on importation; the Australian Federal Police were alerted and a controlled operation authorised whereby an inert substance was substituted for the drugs and the consignment was delivered to the address provided, being that occupied by the offender.
	
	
	The judge expressed himself satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that “the offender knew the substance in the computers was a border controlled drug” and that “he was aware of the approximate quantity of the drug.” [13] 
	
	
	The judge considered that his sole purpose in coming to the country from his home in Canada was to engage in the importation. He dismissed as largely implausible his explanation for his involvement in the receipt of the computers, for impersonating an executive of a non-existent web design company and the reason for his stay in Cabramatta for some weeks without any tourist activity, that being the stated purpose of his trip to Australia. [14] 
	
	
	So far as his role in the importation was concerned, the judge noted evidence that “he had some autonomy in the way he conducted himself in Australia and there is little to suggest he had a role above that of a trusted recipient of drugs and as a consignee.” [15]  The judge was not satisfied that the offender had organised the importation, noted that he had no apparent resources of his own and operated with a degree of naivety and a lack of professionalism. [16]  He used his real driver’s licence and otherwise conducted himself in a manner which the judge considered confirmatory of his presentation in the witness box, namely that he was “neither sophisticated nor has he the capacity for the organisation and planning necessary for such an operation.” In the absence of any other explanation, he considered the offender’s motive was financial gain. He concluded that the offender’s role was “toward the lower end of the hierarchy, not at the lowest end of the hierarchy, he was certainly not a mere minder and he has had some autonomy in his role.”
	
	
	The volume of drug involved was characterised as “just above the threshold for a commercial quantity.” [17]  He accepted evidence that the wholesale value of the cocaine seized was between $760,000 and about $1 million and the street value as between $1.6 million and $1.8 million.
	


Subjective circumstances of offender


	
	There was nothing remarkable in the background of the offender, although he gave evidence that he had been “drinking excessively in the months leading up to his arrest.” He admitted to using cannabis “at times when it was easy to obtain.” [18] 
	
	
	The offender did not give evidence at his trial. Somewhat curiously, given that the judge was bound by the verdict of the jury and the findings as to the essential elements of the offence, the offender gave evidence on sentence maintaining his innocence. As a result, the judge was bound to conclude, as he did, that there was no evidence of remorse. [19]  The judge took into account evidence that he was a trained carpenter, was hard working and maintained his own home renovation business in Canada, and was neither intelligent nor sophisticated. [20] 
	
	
	There was no suggestion that he had any criminal record, nor that he suffered from any identifiable psychiatric condition. The Director’s submission that there was little if anything by way of mitigation in his personal circumstances may be accepted, although, so far as his role was concerned, he might fairly be described as more misguided than malevolent.
	
	
	So far as the sentence was concerned, because he was convicted after a trial, he obtained no benefit from a plea with utilitarian value.
	


Assessment of sentence


	
	For reasons which will be explained, the Director’s submission that the sentence was markedly lenient and involved a marked disparity from at least some prior appellate court decisions should be accepted. Whether it satisfied the strong language of “an affront to community standards” [21]  or was “so disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime as to shock the public conscience” [22]  is less certain.
	
	
	On the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor relied on six cases, of which only three were decided by courts of appeal. The two in this State involved guilty pleas, each attracting a discount of 25%, apparently pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 22, a factor to which it will be necessary to return. The closest in time and circumstances to the present offending was Webber v R. [23]  That case involved a commercial quantity of cocaine very close in amount to the present facts. Following an early plea of guilty (for which a 25% discount was allowed) a sentence of 11 years was imposed with a non-parole period of 7 years. An appeal by the offender alleging that the sentence was manifestly excessive was rejected in this Court.
	
	
	The second case relied upon from this Court was Ng v R (Cth). [24]  In that case the sentencing judge had commenced with a notional starting point (before discount) of 15 years, resulting in a sentence of 11 years 3 months and a non-parole period of 7 years 3 months. The offender’s appeal was rejected. Two factors to note in respect of that offence were that it involved heroin, with the result that the pure weight (2.445 kg) was significantly in excess of the commercial quantity (1.5 kg). Secondly, like Webber, it was an appeal by an offender and thus not directly relevant to establishing a lower limit for an appropriate range. [25] 
	
	
	The third case from an intermediate court of appeal was R v Calis. [26]  That case involved importation of 1.3 kg (pure weight) of methamphetamine, for which the commercial quantity was 750 grams. The offender was convicted after a trial and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years. The trial judge found that the offender was a “bare courier”. The offender’s appeal against sentence was dismissed.
	
	
	Two other cases in county courts involving not guilty pleas and significant quantities of methamphetamine (3 kg and 2 kg respectively), one by an offender described as more than a mere courier, each of whom received sentences of 15 years with 9 year non-parole periods. A third sentence in the Melbourne County Court, involving 1.5 kg of heroin, where there had been an early guilty plea and an offer of assistance, for a person higher than a courier, involved a sentence of 10 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months.
	
	
	This group of sentences relied upon by the Director as “comparatives” gives limited guidance as to the appropriate range in the present case.
	
	
	The respondent relied upon three further cases in this Court and the Queensland Court of Appeal and five cases in the trial courts. All but one (in the District Court of New South Wales) involved pleas of guilty.
	
	
	One matter which arises in this context is what to make of sentences in the course of which the sentencing judge or the appellate court provided a discount of 25% for an early plea of guilty, in apparent conformity with state practice. It appears to have been commonly accepted in this Court, as explained in Lee v R, [27]  that, “[w]hen sentencing for a Commonwealth offence, there is no requirement for the sentencing judge to specify a quantifiable discount for an offender’s guilty plea” and that “[t]he principles [established] in R v Thomson, R v Houlton [28]  do not apply to sentencing for Commonwealth offences.” Rather, the Court continued, the plea is to be taken into account “as recognition of an offender’s willingness to facilitate the course of justice but not on the basis that the plea has saved the community the expense of a contested hearing.” The authority for those propositions is said to be Cameron v The Queen. [29] 
	
	
	Cameron is not authority for that principle. In Cameron the sentence was imposed for an offence against the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 (WA), picked up and applied as federal law by the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 (Cth). [30]  By contrast, s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), identifying general sentencing principles, is said to apply to “federal offences”. The term “federal offence” is defined to mean “an offence against the law of the Commonwealth.” [31]  No doubt the Western Australian Court in Cameron was exercising federal jurisdiction, [32]  but only Kirby J referred to the possibility that s 16A was applicable and, the point not being argued, dealt with the matter on the basis that the offence remained one against a law of the State. [33]  The joint reasons of Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ, whilst recognising that the sentencing exercise took place in federal jurisdiction, made no reference to s 16A, but rather assumed that relevant provisions of the state Sentencing Act applied.
	
	
	Accordingly, Cameron has nothing to say about the operation of Commonwealth law with respect to sentencing. Furthermore, it is at least doubtful that Cameron limits the basis upon which a plea of guilty may be taken into account in the way suggested in Lee. In construing the Western Australian legislation, the joint reasons stated that the relevant provisions “must be read as allowing that a plea of guilty may be taken into account in mitigation for the reason that a guilty plea evidences a willingness to facilitate the course of justice and not simply because the plea saves the time and expense of those involved in the administration of criminal justice.” [34]  It is not possible to read that language as involving a rejection of the second limb identified (saving time and expense). Indeed, it is not possible to read that passage as excluding other relevant bases upon which a plea may considered. What the joint reasons were assessing in that passage was the relevance of identifying the time at which the plea was entered and whether it was possible to enter a plea at an earlier time. Consistently with the proposition that the Court was dealing with state or territory law, the joint reasons in Cameron [35]  quoted with approval a passage from Siganto v The Queen [36]  to the effect that a plea is a matter to be taken into account in mitigation as evidence of (a) remorse, and (b) sparing the community the expense of a contested trial. The joint reasons continued, [37]  noting that remorse was not necessarily the only quality revealed by a plea, which may also indicate “acceptance of responsibility and the willingness to facilitate the course of justice.” Properly understood, all these four overlapping considerations are available bases for reducing a sentence following a plea of guilty.
	
	
	All of this is silent as to whether s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is picked up by s 68 (or s 79 or s 80) of the Judiciary Act, together with the principles established in this State for the application of that section in particular circumstances, including those stated in Thomson and Houlton. A similar, if somewhat more complex application of relevant principle was considered in Bui v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth). [38]  Bui was an appeal from the Victorian Court of Appeal, which had intervened on the application of the Director to increase a sentence for a federal offence. In the past, it has been a well-established principle of state and territory law that, on a prosecution appeal, the otherwise appropriate sentence may be reduced or there may be a refusal to intervene because the offender is put at jeopardy twice in respect of sentence for the one offence, by a prosecutor’s appeal against leniency. In both this State and Victoria, statute has intervened to preclude that form of double jeopardy being taken into account in favour of an offender. [39]  In Bui, the Court of Appeal had held that the Victorian provisions “relevantly modified the judge-made rule of double jeopardy and are effective to exclude the rule on Commonwealth appeals relating to sentencing of federal offences.” [40]  The joint reasons then stated: [41] 
	


“The argument depended upon the concept of double jeopardy being one of the matters to be taken into account under that section. And on that footing, the question would be whether s 16A would prevent the Victorian provisions being picked up by ss 68, 79 or 80 of the Judiciary Act.”


	
	Recognising that “s 16A accommodates the application of some common law principles of sentencing”, [42]  the Court concluded that the application of an “automatic discount” would not be consistent with the requirement of s 16A(1) that the court must impose a sentence “of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.” [43]  The joint reasons further noted that s 16A “has nothing to say about particular matters which an appeal court alone may take into account when considering re-sentencing.” [44]  For these reasons, possibly in combination, the Court concluded that the “presumed anxiety and distress on re-sentencing” which has been described as underpinning the double jeopardy principle, is not a matter to which a court on re-sentencing “is to” have regard under s 16A(2), and s 16A is to be applied “without reference to that presumed state of affairs.” [45] 
	
	
	Section 16A identifies, as one of the matters which a court is to take into account, the fact that the person has pleaded guilty to the charge. [46]  Whether that statement is sufficient to exclude principles of state and territory law, in accordance with Bui, is not easily determined. It is appropriate to disregard the second limb of the reasoning in Bui, as this is not an issue which is confined to an appellate court on re-sentencing. The problem with applying the first limb is that almost anything which might have the effect of mitigating or reducing the relevant sentence might be said to be inconsistent with the requirement in s 16A(1) to impose a sentence “of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.”
	
	
	Assistance may be obtained by reference to the passages in Johnson and Hili identified in Bui with apparent approval. Thus, in Johnson the joint reasons of Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ stated: [47] 
	


“The proposition contained in the first of the appellant's grounds is largely uncontroversial: that except to the extent stated in ss 16A and 16B of the Act, general common law and not peculiarly local or state statutory principles of sentencing are applicable. That common law principles may apply follows from the use of the words ‘of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence ...’ in s 16A(1) and the introductory words ‘In addition to any other matters ...’ to s 16A(2) of the Act.”


	
	The distinction between general common law principles and “peculiarly local or state statutory principles” is by no means easy to apply, nor is the basis for the distinction expressly identified.
	
	
	The guidance from Hili is also inconclusive. Referring to the same passage in Johnson, the Court accepted that s 16A “accommodates the application of [the principle of totality]… and some other judicially developed general sentencing principles because those principles give relevant content to” the statutory expressions referred to in Johnson. [48] 
	
	
	These authorities reflect a view that the underlying purpose of Part 1B of the Crimes Act (which includes s 16A) is to achieve consistency in the application of general sentencing principles with respect to all federal offences. It is for that reason that “local” sentencing principles are not picked up and applied but general principles, as articulated by sentencing courts, will operate. It follows from that conclusion that any of the factors identified in Cameron rendering a plea of guilty relevant to the sentencing process will operate under s 16A(2)(g). On the other hand, local practices with respect to the level of “discounts” to be applied in different circumstances will not have application in relation to sentencing for federal offences. It follows that, to the extent that sentencing judges in the comparative cases sought to fix a starting point and then to reduce the appropriate sentence by 25% for an early guilty plea, they have operated according to a wrong principle. The value of these cases, as part of their comparative exercise, is therefore limited.
	
	
	The second problem which arises with the comparative exercise derives from the attempt by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [49]  to categorise the sentences imposed for various federal offences. The critical categories for present purposes involved importing commercial quantities of drugs, the cases being broken up into four groups. As has been noted in other cases, many offenders fall within the third or fourth groups identified by the Chief Judge. With respect to the third group he stated: [50] 
	


“In this group the head sentences range from 8 years to 15 years, and non-parole periods start at 4 years and end at 11 years. A number of the sentences in this group involved pleas of guilty. The range of sentences represents a noticeable ‘step down’ from the sentences in the previous group. A number of factors appear to explain this. First, the pure quantity of drugs imported is generally below 7 kg. (Two obvious exceptions are Chalmers and NP v R: the former was a successful Crown appeal and the latter involved a very favourable subjective case for the offender.) Secondly, the offenders in this third group occupy mid-range roles between that of principal and courier. (The exception is Speer, which may have been placed within the fourth group had the offender’s plea been entered at an early stage.) Finally, in this group, there are instances of assistance, sometimes significant, provided to the authorities (for example Vasquez-Felipe; NP; Speer; R v W). These efforts attract discounts of up to 30%.”


	
	With respect to the fourth group, he stated: [51] 
	


“In this group the head sentences range from 6.25 years through to 8 years, while the non-parole periods range from around 3 to 4.5 years. The cases are roughly split between those in which the offenders pleaded guilty and those in which they pleaded not guilty. Quantities of drugs range from 1 kg to 30 kg and offenders occupy roles variously described as instigators, overseers, collectors and couriers. Many offenders in this group had good antecedents and no prior convictions.”


	
	One difficulty with applying these categories is that they are defined by the sentences imposed, not the features of the cases. The sentence in the present case fell at the bottom range of the third group and at the top of the fourth group. [52]  It is possible to identify a number of cases having elements of similarity with the present offender who received sentences in the broad range of 7-9 years, with non-parole periods of 5 years or less.
	
	
	In Webber [53]  Fullerton J noted that there had been a line of cases after De La Rosa in which reliance on the categorisation of offenders by the Chief Judge had been said to be of limited assistance where manifest excess or inadequacy of sentence is alleged. [54]  Thus, in R v Holland [55]  McClellan CJ at CL had said of his own judgment in De La Rosa that it would be wrong to sentence an offender by attempting to fit the offender within a particular “category” and then impose a sentence appropriate for an offence sharing characteristics common for that category. [56]  A more helpful exercise would involve identifying the key characteristics of the case under appeal and then seeking cases which are comparable in the sense of revealing similar characteristics, and then identifying the range of sentences imposed in those cases. The value in such an exercise is that it will identify technical disparities (such as the existence or not of a plea and at what stage), allow proper weight to be given to separate features and allow important factors, such as the activity of the offender, to be assessed more accurately than by reference to imprecise labels. [57] 
	
	
	The Director relied on the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Calis [58]  a case which, together with numerous other authorities was considered by Peter Lyons J [59]  in R v Agboti. [60]  Agboti involved an applicant who had pleaded guilty to one count of importing a commercial quantity of methamphetamine. She was arrested on arrival carrying a bag of methamphetamine of 2.3 kg pure weight, the threshold for a commercial quantity being 750 grams. The street value was estimated at between $3.4 million and $10.2 million. Having pleaded guilty, the sentencing judge accepted that she showed genuine remorse. [61]  A sentence of 11 years imprisonment was imposed with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months. On appeal, the sentence was reduced to 9 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. One of the cases relied upon by the offender was Calis, involving the importation of a commercial quantity of methamphetamine having a pure weight of 1.3 kg, about twice the commercial threshold. The offender was described as a “bare courier”. A sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years was said not to be manifestly excessive.
	
	
	A not dissimilar sentence was imposed in the case of R v Thathiah, [62]  upon which the applicant also placed reliance. The offender Thathiah was also convicted after a trial, receiving a sentence of 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years, which he alleged was manifestly excessive. The amount involved equated to 1.45 kg of pure methamphetamine. [63]  The applicant was refused leave to appeal against his sentence.
	
	
	These and other cases referred to in Agboti tend to confirm that the head sentence imposed in the present case is lenient, though not necessarily below an available range, but that the non-parole period is within an appropriate range. Given that the respondent would almost certainly be deported to Canada on completion of his non-parole period, this is not a case in which the Court would intervene merely to vary the head sentence, even were that thought appropriate. In any event, the sentence is not so lenient as to reveal error in principle; it is not necessary to intervene to establish sentencing standards; the Court should therefore dismiss the appeal.
	


Discretionary considerations


	
	If it were otherwise appropriate for the Court to intervene, it would be necessary to consider a range of factors which might militate against intervention. These traditionally include considering the stance adopted by the Director before the sentencing judge; the time at which the offender was put on notice that an appeal was being considered, and the promptness with which a notice of appeal was filed and the matter brought on for hearing. In each of these respects, the Director has acted expeditiously and appropriately. There is one factor which would militate against intervention.
	
	
	This Court was recently required to consider sentences imposed on three co-offenders, Faridani, Karan and Considine. The relevant offence involved importation of a consignment of 3.17 kg of cocaine, said to have a wholesale value of $1 million and a street value of between $2.3 and $2.5 million. Each of the offenders entered a plea of guilty, but the Director appealed with respect to the inadequacy of two, namely Karan and Considine. This Court dealt first with the matter of R v Karan. [64]  The decision in the matter of R v Considine was handed down shortly thereafter. [65] 
	
	
	The sentencing judge found that Faridani played “a significant managerial role in the importation.” [66]  The judge indicated that he would have imposed a head sentence of 12 years if convicted after trial but allowed a discount of 40% for a very early plea and a high level of assistance. The head sentence in fact imposed was 7 years 4 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years 10 months. That sentence was not challenged by the Director. The Director accepted that Karan had played a lesser role than Faridani, Karan’s being an intermediate role between that of manager and a courier responsible for collecting the consignment of goods. Karan was responsible for recruiting Considine and another person, Nadan. The sentencing judge indicated that he would have imposed a head sentence of 5 years on Karan, reduced for a plea at the time of trial by 25%, giving a head sentence of 3 years 9 months and a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months. Considine would have received a head sentence of 2 years 6 months, reduced for a plea and other factors by one third to 1 year 8 months with a non-parole period of 6 months. She had significant subjective factors in her favour. Although this Court ultimately did not intervene to increase her sentence, it held that an undiscounted starting point should have been no less than 3 years 6 months. [67] 
	
	
	In the case of Karan, this Court considered that a starting point of 7 years was a minimum, with the result that the starting point proposed by the sentencing judge of 5 years was excessively lenient. The Court further accepted that the discount of 25% was excessive and that a figure of 15% was appropriate. In the event, that the Court imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. [68] 
	
	
	The circumstances of the various offenders could not readily be equated with the involvement of the respondent in the present case. However, it is clear that he was significantly more involved than Considine but did not exercise the managerial involvement at the level of Faridani. It is possible that he had greater responsibility than Karan, but not markedly so. The difficulty for the Director is that he had submitted that the starting point for Karan should have been “at least 7 years”, prior to discount. [69]  That may have been a generous position to take, but it was accepted by this Court. It is not consistent with the proposition that the sentence imposed on the present respondent (8 years imprisonment) was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	Conscious of the need for consistency, the Director put three submissions with respect to the use of Karan as a comparative case. First, he submitted that the offence in question had been that of an accessory to attempt to possess, rather than an importation. That was said to make the comparison “inherently problematic”. While that may be so in some cases, it is not clear that it was so in the present circumstances. This Court noted in Karan [70]  that the same maximum penalty (life imprisonment) applied to offences of importation, aid and abet and attempt to possess. It further noted, by reference to authority, that attempts to possess were not necessarily a less serious category than importation.
	
	
	Secondly, the Director noted that Karan was a prosecution appeal and therefore, when considering re-sentencing, it was necessary to accept “a degree of restraint”. No doubt that is true and that, in identifying a starting point of seven years, the Director in Karan was seeking to identify the bottom of the range. Nevertheless, the bottom of the range is below the sentence imposed in the present case, meaning that Karan must be distinguished, or the Director has adopted a more stringent standard in the present case.
	
	
	Thirdly, in an apparent attempt to distinguish Karan, the Director noted that there were potential parity issues in that case. The question of disparity apparently arose because the appeal in relation to Considine was not before the Court, so that the Court only had the original sentence imposed on Considine by way of comparison. The significance of this submission is by no means clear: the Court in Karan knew that there was an appeal against leniency in relation to Considine and that its decision would be handed down before the hearing of the appeal in that case. However, there was no indication that a lower sentence was considered appropriate for Karan for that reason, nor that ignorance of the result in Considine had influenced the submissions the Director made with respect to Karan. All that can be said is that the Registrar apparently adjourned the Considine appeal at her request, a course which should ordinarily not happen: it had no effect on the outcome in Karan.
	
	
	In short, none of these factors provides a reason not to infer a degree of inconsistency between the approach adopted in Karan by the Director and the approach he has adopted in the present case. Accordingly, even if the sentence were thought to be unduly lenient, this case would not provide an appropriate vehicle for intervention.
	


Conclusions


	
	As revealed in De La Rosa there is a level of variation, perhaps an undesirable level of variation, between sentences imposed on different offenders for importation of drugs. The variations may be amenable to resolution, but only at a level of fine detail which was not attempted in the present case. It is also true that variations exist between the jurisdictions as to an appropriate ratio between head sentence and non-parole period. However, the ratio exhibited in the present case (the non-parole period being 62.5% of the head sentence) is not unduly low by comparison with other sentences.
	
	
	In the result, it may be said that the present sentence was at the low end of the permissible range, but it has not been demonstrated to lie outside that range. On that basis, the Director’s appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	Even if the sentence had been thought to fall below the permissible range, the fact that the Director was minded to accept a starting point one year less than the sentence imposed in the present case in the not dissimilar matter of Karan is a factor which may be taken into account in declining to exercise the power to intervene.
	
	
	The Director’s appeal against manifest leniency of the sentence should be dismissed.
	
	
	GARLING J: I am unable to agree with the proposed orders of Basten JA.
	
	
	I gratefully adopt the detailed description in the judgment of Basten JA of all of the facts relevant to the imposition of the sentence by McClintock DCJ on 12 December 2014.
	
	
	I have been persuaded that the sentence imposed by McClintock DCJ was manifestly inadequate, and that the Director’s appeal should be allowed.
	
	
	As mine is a dissenting judgment, I can set out my reasons with some economy.
	
	
	The circumstance surrounding the offence demonstrated that the offence itself was a serious one. Here was a planned importation of a prohibited drug, cocaine, in a commercial quantity. The importation was reasonably sophisticated. Whilst the respondent, who had come from Canada to Australia to engage in the importation, did not organise the importation, he was nevertheless regarded, correctly by the sentencing Judge, as not being a mere minder, but a person who had some autonomy in his role, and who was engaged in that role purely for financial gain.
	
	
	Whilst the respondent had not committed any crimes previously, there was nothing in his subjective circumstances put before the sentencing Judge which provided any basis for a substantial mitigation of the penalty to be imposed. He did not plead guilty, but was sentenced after a conviction at trial.
	
	
	The offence of which the respondent was convicted which was one contrary to s 307.1 of the Criminal Code 1995, carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. This was a legislative guidepost to which the sentencing Judge was obliged to have regard.
	
	
	I agree with McClellan CJ at CL in R v Holland [2011] NSWCCA 65 at [3] that it is wrong, in sentencing, for a Judge, or this Court on appeal, to seek out the categories in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De la Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 243 FLR 28, and then impose a sentence appropriate to the category. Rather, it is appropriate to proceed on the basis that the sentence passed in other cases can “… stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence”: De la Rosa at [304] per Simpson J. See also Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [54].
	
	
	At the sentencing hearing, and again on appeal, both the Crown and the Respondent referred to cases which they each argued had characteristics which were similar, in some but not all respects, to the present case.
	
	
	The cases, which seem to me to be of particular relevance in the way in which comparable cases can properly be used, suggest that a head sentence in the order of 14 to 15 years with a non-parole period in the order of 7 to 10 years as the range of sentences which had been imposed by sentencing judges, or else upheld in various Courts of Appeal.
	
	
	Those cases, namely Ng v R [2010] NSWCCA 232 and Webber v R [2014] NSWCCA 111, which were decisions of this Court, contain sufficient features of similarity to this matter as to provide a reasonable yardstick against which to examine the sentence imposed by McClintock DCJ.
	
	
	In my opinion these two cases contain characteristics more akin to this case and are a surer guide to an appropriate sentence in this case than many other decisions referred to.
	
	
	By reference to these cases, I am persuaded that the sentence in this case was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	In my view, the sentence imposed in this case does not adequately address the seriousness of the offence, the role engaged in by the respondent, and the need for general deterrence with respect to offences of importing commercial quantities of prohibited drugs into Australia. Having regard to the value of the importation, and the quantity available for distribution to the end user, a sentence of the kind imposed in this case, particularly after a trial, does not give any adequate attention to the need to deter others from committing similar offences.
	
	
	I also disagree with the conclusion of Basten JA that the residual discretion to dismiss this appeal should be engaged. The facts and circumstances of the decisions to which his Honour refers are, in my view, exceptional, and do not warrant a conclusion that the Director’s appeal in this case ought be dismissed. On the contrary, I am of the view that, in order to ensure proper standards in sentencing for offences of this kind, there is good reason for this appeal to be upheld.
	
	
	HAMILL J: I agree with Basten JA that the appeal should be dismissed. I also agree with his Honour’s reasons for that conclusion.
	
	
	I agree with Basten JA that the High Court in Cameron v The Queen [71]  did not limit the impact of a federal offender’s plea of guilty to an assessment of the extent to which it demonstrated a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. However, I would prefer to leave a more general consideration of the interaction of Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) with the general sentencing law of New South Wales, and the extent to which that consideration is informed by the decisions in cases such as Cameron v The Queen, Wong v The Queen [72]  and Bui v DPP [73]  for a case when those matters are subject to full argument.

		05 August 2015",2015-08-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2425704,"Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Hall, Jason [2015] NSWLC 12","​judgment


	
	This is a decision following remittal of the matter from the Supreme Court. In Hall v Director of Public Prosecutions [2015] NSWSC 839, Campbell J made the following orders:
	



	Grant leave to appeal;
	Appeal allowed;
	Set aside the order of her Honour Magistrate Robinson pronounced on 3 November 2014 granting leave for the prosecution to proceed as on indictment under s 263(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (""the Act"");
	Remit the matter at the Local Court for determination according to law.


Background


	
	On 1 August 2014 the defendant, Jason Daniel Hall, was arrested in Sydney for offences alleged to have been committed by him earlier that day. At the time of arrest there were outstanding warrants for his arrest in respect of other matters. He was also on parole and the subject of a bond by way of s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""s 9 good behaviour bond""). The offences the subject of these proceedings were allegedly committed in breach of parole and in breach of the s 9 good behaviour bond.
	
	
	The offences included Table 1 and Table 2 offences as well as strictly summary offences.
	
	
	The charges were first listed on 2 August 2014 before the Local Court at Parramatta, and then on 8 August 2014 before Central Local Court. On 13 August 2014 the matter was again mentioned at Central Local Court, at which time the defendant entered pleas of not guilty to all charges. Orders were made for the service of the brief by 13 September 2014 and the matter was stood over to 26 September 2014 at Central Local Court to fix a hearing date. On 26 September 2014 the matter was listed for hearing on 3 November 2014.
	
	
	On 8 October 2014 the matter was listed before Central Local Court for an application to vacate the hearing date. That application was stood over to 13 October 2014, and again to 17 October 2014, at which time the police prosecutor appearing in the matter sought to vacate the hearing date on the grounds that DNA evidence remained outstanding and that some police witnesses were unavailable on 3 November 2014. The application to vacate was granted.
	
	
	The matter was mentioned again on 24 October 2014 at Central Local Court. The hearing was formally vacated and the matter stood over to 3 November 2014 for either election or to fix a hearing date.
	


3 November 2014 - Mention


	
	When the matter came before Central Local Court on 3 November 2014 there were three sets of sequences in total before the Court. The sequences the subject of this decision are identified by charge number H 55121852. Two other sets of sequences, H 55095540 and H 55458321, were subject to election by the Director of Public Prosecutions (""the Director"") when those matters came before Central Local Court on 21 October 2014, and were adjourned over for mention on 3 November 2014.
	
	
	On 3 November 2014 the learned Magistrate heard argument relating to the Director’s election of the offences in charge sequence H 55121852 and an application that all three sets of sequences be adjourned after directions were given in relation to the service of the balance of the brief of evidence.
	
	
	In Hall v Director of Public Prosecutions (supra), his Honour Justice Campbell stated at [1] - [3]:
	


""1  The plaintiff challenges a decision made by a magistrate in criminal proceedings in the Local Court. The actual decision, and I am deliberately using that expression neutrally, is a grant of leave for the prosecution to proceed on indictment after the time fixed under s 263 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) had expired. By dint of s 263(2) 'an election may, with the leave of the Local Court, be made after the time so fixed [under s 263(1)] if the Court is satisfied that special circumstances exist' (my emphasis).

2  It is common ground between the parties that the learned magistrate granted leave under s 263(2) and in doing so failed to apply the statutory test of asking herself whether she was satisfied that special circumstances exist. I have used the language of challenge at the commencement of these reasons because the plaintiff in his summons commencing the proceedings has sought relieve in the alternative. First, he has sought leave to appeal from what he styles an interlocutory order of the learned magistrate in accordance with s 53(3)(b) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW); secondly, and in the alternative, he has sought judicial review of the decision under s 69 Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW).

3  As I have said, there is no issue between the parties that the learned magistrate failed to identify and apply the correct statutory test. The time fixed for the prosecution to make an election under s 263 is to be found in the Local Court practice notes which have been referred to by learned counsel in their written submissions. There is no question that that time had expired, on any view of it, by the time an application was made to her Honour Magistrate Robinson on 3 November 2014.""

Special circumstances


	
	In relation to the sequences identified by charge number H 55121852 the Director seeks to elect to proceed on indictment outside of the time allowed by s 263(1) of the Act.
	
	
	The matter having been remitted to the Local Court for determination according to law, it is now necessary to determine whether special circumstances exist for the purposes of s 263(2) of the Act.
	
	
	“Special circumstances” is not defined in the Act, nor is there any judicial consideration of this particular statutory test. However, s 93 of the Act has been considered judicially.
	
	
	In Baines v Gould (1993) 67 A Crim R 297, Studdert J held:
	


“The Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines 'special' as meaning 'of such a kind as to exceed in some way that which is usual or common' and, also 'exceptional in character, quality or degree.'""


	
	In TEZ v Longley [2004] NSWSC 74; 142 A Crim R 122, Shaw J set out the elements relevant to the application of special circumstances in the context of applications pursuant to s 93 of the Act (""s 93 applications"") at [20]:
	


“The totality of the relevant issues in each case should be considered in determining whether or not the reasons are special for the purposes of the Act: Lawler v Johnson & Anor (2002) 56 NSWLR 1 at 10 per O’Keefe J. Hunt CJ at CL with whom Smart and Grove JJ agreed, emphasised the need for individual consideration of each case in R v Kennedy (1997) A Crim R 341 at 352: 

What are 'special reasons' and what are not will vary from case to case and cannot be defined in advance. The decision should not be approached in an unduly restrictive way...”


	
	His Honour then quotes O’Hare v DPP [2000] NSWSC 430 at [51], relying on Studdert J in Baines v Gould (supra) at 303:
	


“In summary the decided cases in New South Wales establish and in Victoria and South Australia indicate that the facts or situations that constitute “special reasons” should not be confined by precise legal definition, are not a closed category, should not be approached in an unduly restricted way and need to be:


	
	special in relation to the particular case;
	
	
	solid, that is substantial in nature;
	
	
	not common or usual;
	
	
	out of the ordinary;
	
	
	unusual or atypical;
	
	
	clearly distinguishable from the general run of cases”
	



	
	The special circumstances relied upon by the Director in making the election out of time are these:
	



	That at the time of the commission of the offences the defendant was subject to parole and to a s 9 good behaviour bond;
	That the offences are serious, one of which having a maximum penalty of 10 years of imprisonment;
	That the defendant has an extensive criminal history;
	That the defendant has had other matters before the Court for which he is currently serving a custodial sentence; and
	That, if the election were not allowed out of time, the Local Court would not have sufficient sentencing scope to appropriately deal with all matters should the defendant be convicted.


Decision


	
	It is submitted on the defendant’s behalf that the reasons for the election being made late do not amount to special circumstances warranting leave to elect at a late stage. It is submitted that this case is special neither by facts nor procedure. I reject that submission. In the absence of any jurisprudence as to what constitutes “special circumstances” for the purposes of s 263(2) of the Act, I have had regard to the factors set out in Baines v Gould (supra), including the principle that what constitutes “special reasons” should not be approached in an unduly restricted way.
	
	
	When the two other sets of sequences, H 55095540 and H 55458321, came before Central Local Court on 21 October 2014 the Director made the election to proceed on indictment pursuant to s 263 of the Act. The offences the subject of this application are alleged to have been committed last in time of all of the offences. It is submitted that the prosecution intention was at all times that all matters, including sequence H 55121852, should proceed on indictment and not be dealt with by the Local Court.
	
	
	The defendant is currently in custody serving a number of sentences of imprisonment, as evidenced by his criminal history (Annexure A to the Affidavit of Helen Langley sworn 3 June 2015). His earliest release date is 30 January 2016. Following his arrest on 1 August 2014 his parole was revoked in respect of sentences imposed by her Honour Judge Ainslie-Wallace (as her Honour then was) on 27 March 2006 for 27 offences, principally robberies and thefts, with a further 65 offences taken into account by way of Form 1. The aggregate sentence imposed was 10 years and 9 months commencing 27 February 2005, the effective non-parole period being 8 years.
	
	
	In addition to that sentence, the defendant is serving a sentence of 12 months imprisonment imposed on 17 September 2014 at Central Local Court, dating from 17 July 2014 with a non-parole period of six months.
	
	
	The defendant also remains subject to a s 9 good behaviour bond imposed on 18 June 2014 at Balmain Local Court.
	
	
	I find that these facts are special in relation to this particular case, that they are substantial in nature, that they are not common or usual, they are out of the ordinary, unusual or atypical and clearly distinguishable from the general run of cases.
	
	
	Moreover, if the defendant is ultimately convicted of the H 55121852 offences the Local Court would have no scope to impose any penalty referrable to the offending conduct involved in those offences. This, in and of itself, is substantial and clearly distinguishable from other cases.
	
	
	I am satisfied that there are special circumstances for the purposes of s 263(2) of the Act which warrant the grant of leave for an election to be made after the time fixed by s 263(1).
	


Order


	
	The application for leave for the Director to elect to proceed on indictment out of time is granted.

2426172,"Police v Smith, Mark Joseph [2015] NSWLC 18","Judgment


	
	At about 3.00 in the morning on the 5th of April last year, police were called to a single-vehicle car accident on Pittwater Road in Dee Why. When they arrived they found the accused, Mark Smith, trapped in the driver's seat of his car, which had crashed into a power pole. A taxi driver who saw the crash said that the accused's car wasn't speeding and didn't swerve or take any evasive action - it simply entered the intersection of Lismore Avenue and Pittwater Road, drove through it and crashed into the power pole on the other side. The crash took place about 2 kilometres from the accused's home, and at the time, the accused's car was travelling towards, rather than away from, his home.
	
	
	People who spoke with Mr Smith at the scene reported that he was somewhat incoherent, and was not speaking in complete sentences. He did, however, tell them his name. They noticed that he smelled strongly of alcohol.
	
	
	Mr Smith had to be cut out of his car, and he was taken to hospital with significant injuries. His blood was tested, and he was found to have a blood alcohol reading of 0.110, which is well into the mid-range. Also in his blood were a number of prescription medications, including the sleeping medication stilnox, the active ingredient of which is a drug called zolpidem. Mr Smith suffers from a number of complex and inter-related medical conditions, and it is not ultimately disputed that all of the medications, including stilnox, had been prescribed for him by medical practitioners. The prescription medications were at therapeutic levels.
	
	
	Mr Smith says he has no memory of driving his car. He says that on the day leading up to the crash, he had visited a sick child in hospital, and that child sadly died. Despite a history of alcohol abuse, Mr Smith had been abstinent from alcohol for a considerable period of time, but upon the passing of the young child, he decided to get drunk. After returning to his home by public transport, he says he walked down to the Collaroy Beach Club, a few hundred metres from his home, and began drinking. He says he had 8 or 9 schooners of full strength beer in the space of about 3 1/2 hours, which on any view is a substantial amount of alcohol. He says after that he walked home, got ready for bed, and went to bed at about 11pm. Just before going to bed, he took his prescription medications, including stilnox, and went to sleep. He says that his next memory is of waking up in intensive care at Royal North Shore hospital the following day.
	
	
	There is no dispute in this case that Mr Smith in fact drove his car, crashing it into the power pole. There is no dispute that his blood alcohol concentration was within the mid-range at the time he did so.
	
	
	As a consequence of that driving, he has been charged with the following four offences:
	



	
	Drive with mid-range PCA;
	
	
	Use unregistered vehicle;
	
	
	Use uninsured vehicle; and
	
	
	Drive a vehicle on a road for which tax has not been paid.
	



	
	Although the fact that the accused was driving in the circumstances referred to in the charges is not in dispute, the defence submit that he is not guilty of any of them, because the prosecution cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that his driving was voluntary. That is because at the time of the driving, there is a reasonable possibility that he was in fact asleep. It is submitted that stilnox can cause people to enter a state known as parasomnia, in which people can perform reasonably complex actions, including driving, despite being technically asleep. If Mr Smith was indeed asleep, then it could not be said that his driving of the vehicle was voluntary, and so he is not criminally responsible for it. It is, in other words, a case of automatism.
	
	
	This contention, made on behalf of the accused, raises a number of issues. Before considering those, though, I should record some other short facts that are not in dispute.
	
	
	It is common ground that Mr Smith's car was not insured, and not registered. Evidence before me indicates that the registration had expired on the 20 January 2014, about two and a half months before the collision. Mr Smith says the car was parked on the street near his house. He says that he had only recently bought it, which is why the registration had not been renewed. That issue was not further explored in the evidence.
	
	
	It is well settled that where a question as to voluntariness is raised by the evidence, the onus rests on the prosecution to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused's actions were voluntary. No onus is cast on the accused other than what is generally described as an ""evidentiary burden"", that is, a responsibility to point to ""some evidence from which it can be inferred that there is a reasonable possibility that the act of the accused was not voluntary"": Woodbridge v R [2010] NSWCCA 185 at [73].
	
	
	In this case, the defence have gone beyond a mere assertion that the accused may have been acting involuntarily, and have positively adduced sworn evidence in support of the proposition, both from the accused himself, and from a pharmacologist named Dr Geraldine Moses. That evidence is met with three preliminary challenges by the prosecution, which I first need to address before going on to consider the substantive issues in the case. The three preliminary challenges are these: firstly, that the evidence of Dr Moses should not be admitted under s 79 of the Evidence Act, or should be excluded under s 135; secondly, that pursuant to s 428G(1) of the Crimes Act it should not be taken into account on the question of voluntariness, because any intoxication was self-induced; and thirdly, that even if the evidence is admitted and taken into account, it does not discharge the accused's evidentiary burden, so that the issue of automatism has not been properly enlivened. There is a fourth preliminary issue that naturally arises from the evidence, which is this: if any issue of automatism arises, is it properly characterised as sane or insane automatism?
	


The first preliminary issue - is Dr Moses' evidence admissible (Evidence Act, s 79 & s 135)?


	
	The prosecutor at the outset of these proceedings indicated that he objected to Dr Moses' evidence on the basis that it was opinion evidence which did not fall within the exception in s 79 of the Evidence Act; or alternatively that it should be excluded under s 135. By agreement, Dr Moses' evidence was taken in its entirety, along with all the other evidence in the case, and the question of admissibility was deferred until the end of the evidence. Such a course was both pragmatic and entirely appropriate in the context of the issues in this case. It is of course now necessary to resolve the question of admissibility before moving to any substantive determination.
	
	
	The particular value of Dr Moses' evidence to the accused is said to be this: Dr Moses says the drug zolpidem, which is the active ingredient of stilnox, can on rare occasions induce a state of ""parasomnia"", in which people perform such complex actions as sleep-walking, sleep-cooking, sleep-eating, sleep-smoking, and, most relevantly, sleep-driving. Dr Moses describes it in this way (at p 13):
	


The parasomnias are a a group of complex semi-purposeful physical or verbal behaviours that occur during the sleep period, of which sleepwalking is one.... Sleepwalking results from incomplete or partial arousal from slow-wave sleep.

...

During sleepwalking the person appears to be awake, as their eyes are open and they can perform complex tasks and engage in conversation, albeit often in slurred or bizarre speech. If obtained, a sleepwalker's EEG (electrical brainwave activity) pattern usually shows they are asleep. Although many people perform long complex tasks such as driving and cooking whilst sleepwalking, it is characteristic for sleepwalkers to have no memory or, at best, 'glimpses' of their sleep-related behaviour.


	
	Dr Moses goes on to express the opinion that in Mr Smith's case, the accused was ""very likely"" in such a zolpidem-induced state of parasomnia at the time he drove, and crashed, his vehicle.
	
	
	There is no dispute that Dr Moses is a pharmacologist of considerable experience and renown. So far as s 79 is concerned, the prosecution contend that Dr Moses' opinion relies largely on ""untested, anecdotal, self-reported evidence, from people who have had adverse reactions to stilnox and people who have been charged by police with criminal offences after these alleged adverse reactions."" Specifically, as I understand the submissions, the objections to the evidence are twofold:
	



	
	Dr Moses does not have ""specialised knowledge"" regarding zolpidem and parasomnias, because such specialised knowledge does not exist. Put another way, the state of the current scientific literature is not sufficient to establish either that ""sleep-driving"", as a phenomenon, can exist, or that zolpidem can cause it.
	
	
	If such ""specialised knowledge"" does exist, then Dr Moses' opinion does not sufficiently demonstrate the process of reasoning by which she expresses the opinion that the accused in this case was probably in a state of zolpidem-induced parasomnia.
	



	
	Dealing with the first issue, I note this. Although the prosecution advanced some skepticism in relation to the existence of zolpidem-induced parasomnia, as I understand the evidence they did not advance a direct forensic challenge to it as a phenomenon. Dr Judith Perl gave evidence on behalf of the prosecution. Her expertise was not called into question. Importantly though, Dr Perl herself did not deny that the phenomenon may exist; her evidence was limited, as I have described, to advancing skepticism, both with respect to the phenomenon generally, and with respect to its application in this case specifically.
	
	
	Because of the way the evidence fell, and because this is a criminal prosecution (with the associated criminal standard of proof), it does not fall to me to try and make a determination as to whether the phenomenon is real or not. The ultimate question for me is (subject to the evidence I find to be admissible), whether the prosecution have proved beyond a reasonable doubt, either that it is not a real phenomenon, or if there is a reasonable possibility it is, that it was not affecting the accused at the time he was driving. Because of that, it is not necessary to review the minutae of Dr Moses' assertion that the phenomenon is real. I am satisfied that Dr Moses' evidence demonstrates sufficient scientific support for it to render the evidence admissible under s 79, and Dr Perl does not appear to me to put a contrary position. In addition to the detailed references to the evidence base contained in Dr Moses' report, I draw some comfort from the fact that the Therapeutic Goods Administration, this country's peak regulatory body, has, since 21 February 2008, imposed a box warning on zolpidem-containing medications which includes this:
	


Zolpidem may be associated with potentially dangerous complex sleep-related behaviours which may include sleep walking, sleep driving and other bizarre behaviours.


	
	So far as the second part of the objection is concerned, namely that Dr Moses' opinion does not sufficiently identify the process of reasoning through which she ultimately comes to her opinion, I disagree. The facts of this case, and the reasoning by which she applied them to her specialised knowledge, are quite clearly set out, particularly at sections 13 and 14 of her report, beginning at page 21.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am of the view that the evidence of Dr Moses falls within the terms of s 79 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The objection under s 135 has not been forcefully put. So far as it is based on s 135(a), that the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial to the prosecution, the objection is without merit. Unfair prejudice is the risk that the tribunal of fact will use the evidence in some illogical or irrational way, whether by affording it more weight than it deserves, or by some other means. It would be a rare case indeed in which such a risk arose where the tribunal of fact is a professional arbiter, such as a Magistrate or a Judge sitting alone. In my view, I am quite capable of assessing the rational force of the evidence, whilst taking into account the forensic criticisms made of it. The same can be said of the objection under s 135(b).
	
	
	Accordingly, I admit the evidence.
	


The second preliminary issue - can evidence of zolpidem intoxication be taken into account on the question of voluntariness (s 428G, Crimes Act)?


	
	Section 428G of the Crimes Act is in these terms:
	


428G Intoxication and the actus reus of an offence

(1) In determining whether a person has committed an offence, evidence of self-induced intoxication cannot be taken into account in determining whether the relevant conduct was voluntary.

(2) However, a person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the relevant conduct resulted from intoxication that was not self-induced.


	
	In this case, Dr Moses asserts that the accused's involuntariness was brought about by ingestion of zolpidem. It is clear, though, that he also ingested alcohol. Dr Moses says that the consumption of alcohol can add to the effects of zolpidem, and, importantly, may increase the risk of a zolpidem-induced parasomnic episode. It is common ground that those who take zolpidem should not also drink alcohol, and that both doctors and pharmacists are under a continuing obligation to ensure that their patients are warned not to do so. The accused, though, asserts that he has never been given such a warning.
	
	
	The Crown case, then, is that if the accused was in a state of parasomnia, it was brought about by a combination of alcohol and zolpidem, each of which he freely took. In those circumstances, if the alcohol triggered the zolpidem-induced parasomnia, then his condition is properly described as ""self-induced intoxication"", which, according to s 428G(1), cannot be taken into account on the question of voluntariness.
	
	
	Self-induced intoxication is a defined term. The definition, contained in s 428A, is (relevantly) as follows:
	


Self-induced intoxication means any intoxication except intoxication that:

(a) ...

(b) ...

(c) results from the administration of a drug for which a prescription is required in accordance with the prescription of a medical practitioner, a registered nurse whose registration is endorsed under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law as being qualified to practise as a nurse practitioner, a registered midwife whose registration is endorsed under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law as being qualified to practise as a midwife practitioner, or dentist, or of a drug for which no prescription is required administered for the purpose, and in accordance with the dosage level recommended, in the manufacturer’s instructions.


	
	That definition of self-induced intoxication is, to my mind, drafted in exhaustive terms. In this case, the accused has given sworn evidence that the drug was prescribed for him by a doctor; that it was taken for a purpose for which it had been made, namely as a sleeping medication; and that he took the amount he was instructed to take. Not surprisingly, there is no evidence to the contrary. Applying the terms of the (somewhat cumbersomely drafted) definition, then, Mr Smith's evidence supports an assertion that any intoxication by zolpidem:
	



	
	resulted from the administration of a drug
	
	
	for which a prescription is required
	
	
	in accordance with the prescription of a medical practitioner
	
	
	administered for the purpose
	
	
	and in accordance with the dosage level recommended
	
	
	in the manufacturer's instructions.
	



	
	Put in those terms, taking the definition of self-induced intoxication on its face, any intoxication by zolpidem was not self-induced, and hence must be taken into account on the question of voluntariness.
	
	
	In Hadba v R (2004) 146 A Crim R 291, the ACT Supreme Court considered a very similar provision to the definition of self-induced intoxication in s 428A. In considering a similar question as to whether the appellant's intoxication was relevantly ""caused"" by alcohol or by some other prescription medication he was then taking, the Court said this (at [19]):
	


The provisions of ss338 and 339 are not concerned with the voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs per se, but rather with self-induced intoxication and it is the causation of the relevant state of intoxication that is the decisive issue. At least in the civil law it is now clear that issues of causation must be determined not by reference to the ""but for"" test but by the application of the ""common sense"" test described by the High Court in March v E & MH Stramare P/L [1991] HCA 12. In our opinion any question of whether intoxication came about as a consequence of one or more of the factors specified in s338(2) should be approached in a similar manner.


	
	I confess that I respectfully hold some reservations about the correctness of their Honours' approach in Hadba, given that the term ""self-induced intoxication"" is, to my mind, exhaustively defined in s 428A. However, I need not venture further along those lines other than to express my reservation, since the nature of the evidence in this case is such that, even on the test in Hadba, the accused's intoxication in this case falls outside the definition of being self-induced. It is very clear from Dr Moses' evidence that the underlying pharmacological issue is that zolpidem is capable of inducing a state of parasomnia. The circumstances in which it will do so are not directly predictable. Alcohol is one risk factor, but there are others. As I understand her evidence, although drinking alcohol whilst taking zolpidem may in some individuals trigger a parasomnic episode, it will certainly not always do so, even within the same individual. Similarly, some individuals may have a zolpidem-induced parasomnic episode without taking alcohol. The parasomnic state, then, is fundamentally brought about, or caused, by the zolpidem, not anything else. Where, as here, the zolpidem was taken in accordance with a prescription, and in accordance with the other elements of the definition of non-self induced intoxication in s 428A, any behavioural sequellae must be characterised as non-self induced.
	
	
	Accordingly, I find that the evidence relating to intoxication by zolpidem is to be taken into account on the question of voluntariness.
	


The third preliminary issue - has the issue of automatism been enlivened?


	
	The prosecution submits that the accused has not discharged his evidentiary burden of raising the issue of automatism; that the evidence in the case has not sufficiently ""enlivened"" the issue. In particular, the prosecution submit that although the evidence in the defence case has raised a ""bare"" possibility that the accused was in a state of automatism, it has not raised a ""reasonable possibility"".
	
	
	With respect to the prosecution, it seems to me that this submission may be attended by error. Although it was not specifically stated, this submission resonates strongly with the reasoning of the High Court in CTM v R (2008) 236 CLR 440, but the analogy is not valid. In CTM, the High Court determined that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact applies to offences under s 66C of the Crimes Act, of sexual intercourse with a child under 16. The High Court confirmed that an honest and reasonable mistake of fact as to the age of the complainant is an available means of exculpation, and that, once raised, it is for the prosecution to disprove beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	However, the majority in CTM found that the issue of honest and reasonable mistake had not been sufficiently ""enlivened"" in that case, and that the accused had not discharged his evidentiary burden. Specifically, the majority found that although there was evidence raising the bare issue of mistake, there was no evidence capable of raising either the honesty or the reasonableness of that mistake.
	
	
	The prosecution argue at page 4 of their submissions that although there may be evidence to point to a ""possibility"" that the accused was in a state of automatism, there is no evidence as to its reasonableness - they submit that ""the defendant has not raised to any satisfactory evidentiary standard that it is a 'reasonable possibility'"". As I have noted, whilst that submission does have some resonance with the language of the High Court in CTM, there is a fundamental difference between CTM and the present case. Although neither honest and reasonable mistake nor automatism are a defence in the true legal sense, they nevertheless have different components - something akin to elements - that the prosecution must disprove. An honest and reasonable mistake of fact has three such components - that it is honest, that it is reasonable, and that the mistake is one of fact. Where there is some evidence capable of ""enlivening"" each of those three matters, then the onus rests on the prosecution to disprove them beyond reasonable doubt. Reasonableness, however, is not an independent component of automatism, and the only involvement of the concept of ""reasonableness"" is that the prosecution must disprove automatism beyond ""reasonable"" doubt.
	
	
	In this way, it appears that the prosecution may have somewhat conflated the issue of exactly what the content of the evidentiary burden should be, perhaps (either advertently or inadvertently) because of the similar language in CTM. Whatever be the case, I am firmly of the view that the evidentiary onus on the accused goes no further than to raise the issue of automatism in a genuine way upon the evidence, and that having done so, the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it is not so. Attempts at parsing the meaning of the criminal onus and burden of proof are fraught with difficulty, as courts at all levels have long recognised: see for example Green v R (1971) 126 CLR 28.
	
	
	Ultimately, then, on this second preliminary issue, I am satisfied that the accused has discharged the evidentiary burden of putting automatism in issue. That being so, it remains to be determined whether the prosecution have proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused was not in such a state at the time of driving.
	
	
	Before turning to answer that question, though, and the last remaining preliminary issue, there is one other observation I should make regarding the onus of proof, which is this. The prosecution submissions focus on many ways in which the accused could have supported his claim, but failed to do so. Those matters are collected at page 11 of the written submissions, and include such matters as the fact that the accused has not produced any prescription, and that he did not call any doctor or pharmacist to give evidence on his behalf. There was cross-examination about some of those matters, but not others. In approaching those submissions, I am mindful of the need to ensure that I do not reverse the onus of proof. A number of the matters referred to in the submissions, including the hospital records, and, once Dr Moses' report was furnished, evidence from treating doctors and dispensing pharmacists, could have been obtained by the prosecution. As a consequence of the cross-examination, some of those matters bear upon the accused's credibility, but beyond that, I remind myself that the burden of proof is on, and remains on, the prosecution.
	


The fourth preliminary issue - is the evidence directed towards a finding of sane or insane automatism?


	
	I mention this issue for completeness. It has not been strongly litigated by either party, but since in my view it arises on the evidence, it is appropriate to make brief comment upon it.
	
	
	It is clearly the case that not everyone who takes stilnox will experience parasomnia. Nor will everyone who takes stilnox and alcohol together have such an experience. Indeed, there is material in Dr Moses' report which is suggestive of an underlying predisposition in the accused to have such episodes. At page 9 she says this:
	


It should be noted that throughout the ten years of taking zolpidem, Mr Smith experienced at least three episodes of parasomnia that he knows about. These episodes are relevant to this case in that they represent Mr Smith's idiosyncratic predisposition/vulnerability to the sleep-walking side effects of zolpidem, since only a minority of people are affected in this way.


	
	The distinction between sane and insane automatism is explained in paragraphs [65]-[67] of Woodbridge v R [2010] NSWCCA 185, which was helpfully extracted in the prosecution's written submissions. The Court said this:
	


65 In The Queen v Radford (1985) 42 SASR 266 at 276 King CJ explained the difference between sane automatism and insane automatism as follows:

The significant distinction is between the reaction of an unsound mind to its own delusions or to external stimuli on the one hand and the reaction of a sound mind to external stimuli, including stress producing factors, on the other hand.

66 This statement was said by Hunt J in R v Youssef (1990) 50 A Crim R 1 at 5 to be the clearest statement of the distinction. King CJ's discussion of the distinction was approved in The Queen v Falconer (1990) 171 CLR 30 at 41-42, 48-49, 60, 76 and 85.

67 In Falconer Gaudron J said (at 85):

In general terms, a recurring state which involves some abnormality will indicate a mind that is diseased or infirm, but the fundamental distinction is necessarily between those mental states which, although resulting in abnormal behaviour, are or may be experienced by normal persons (as, for example and relevant to the issue of involuntariness, a state of mind resulting from a blow to the head) and those which are never experienced by or encountered in normal persons. ... And in Radford, King C.J. (75) distinguished between ""an underlying pathological infirmity of the mind, ... which can be properly termed mental illness"" and ""the reaction of a healthy mind to extraordinary external stimuli"".

68 As Deane and Dawson JJ make clear in Falconer in the passage the trial judge set out at para [14] of his judgment, there may be cases in which the evidence allows alternative contentions, that an accused's acts were involuntary either by reason of mental disease or natural mental infirmity on the one hand, or by reason of the operation of a defence upon a normal mind.


	
	Given what is said to be an underlying predisposition on the part of the accused to zolpidem-induced parasomnia, the question naturally arises as to whether there is an ""underlying pathological infirmity of the mind"", such that any automatism is more appropriately characterised as insane, rather than sane, automatism. However, as I have already noted, this question has not been significantly explored, and nor is it strongly contended by the prosecution that this is a case which, on the balance of probabilities, is of insane rather than sane automatism. In an appropriate case it may be so, but here there is insufficient material to establish insanity.
	


Have the prosecution proved the guilt of the accused?


	
	Having dealt with the preliminary issues, I turn, finally, to the substantive question. Have the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused's driving was voluntary? Put another way, have the prosecution removed the reasonable possibility that the accused was driving in a parasomnic state? The answer to these questions turns ultimately on a number of factual matters.
	
	
	As I have already noted, Dr Moses claims that in certain cases, stilnox may cause parasomnia, and people can and do undertake complex tasks within that state. If they do, they are not exercising free and voluntary choice, since they are fundamentally asleep. A person in such a state can properly be regarded as an automaton as that term is used in the authorities.
	
	
	Dr Perl, on behalf of the prosecution, has expressed some well-founded and legitimate skepticism as to whether stilnox-induced parasomnia is a real phenomenon, but in my view she stops short of asserting that it does not exist.
	
	
	Taking those two opinions together, I am of the view that it is at least a reasonable possibility that the phenomenon exists. I would venture no higher than that, but nor do I need to for present purposes.
	
	
	Dr Moses expresses the opinion, based on matters told to her by the accused, that there is a high probability the accused was indeed in such a parasomnic state, brought about by taking stilnox. There is no doubt that he took stilnox, it was in his blood. But the key facts underpinning her opinion, most of which come from the accused, include these:
	



	
	He had no memory of driving, and claims that he remembers nothing from when he went to bed until he woke up the next morning in hospital.
	
	
	He claims that he had walked home from the hotel and had gone to bed and to sleep - he therefore had absolutely no reason to drive.
	
	
	Immediately before the collision, the accused did not swerve, brake or take any evasive action.
	
	
	Witnesses who saw him at the scene of the collision described him as slurring his words, incoherent and not speaking in complete sentences.
	
	
	He had on at least three previous occasions exhibited activity consistent with stilnox-induced parasomnia, indicating that he had an idiosyncratic predisposition to the phenomenon.
	
	
	As well as consuming stilnox and alcohol, the accused took a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, epilim, which is believed to increase the risk of parasomnia.
	



	
	These facts underpin Dr moses' opinion and are essential to it. Except in respect of matters 3 and 4, they are founded on the truthfulness of the accused's self-reporting. The prosecution submit that I should reject his evidence about these critical facts, and if I do, then the whole basis of Dr Moses' opinion falls away. I agree that that would be the consequence of completely rejecting the accused's evidence.
	
	
	Speaking frankly, like the prosecution I am deeply skeptical about the accused's evidence. I certainly would not accept it on the balance of probabilities. Besides the inherent implausibility of it, I note the following:
	



	
	There is something of a convenient coincidence in the fact that the only documented instance of the accused potentially being in a parasomnic state coincides with him being charged with a criminal offence.
	
	
	There is an implicit unlikelihood in the notion that he could perform such a complex action not merely of driving, but of driving for perhaps more than 2kms before crashing.
	
	
	It is at least highly surprising that even in a parasomnic state, despite having already gone to bed, he had the presence of mind to take his wallet with him.
	
	
	Dr Moses said that those in a parasomnic state are capable of performing complex actions that are familiar and reflexive, but the accused's car was out of registration and had been for some time. Assuming he was acting lawfully, it is unlikely that he had driven at all in quite some time.
	
	
	At the time of the collision, the accused was driving towards his home rather than away from it - plainly, he had gone to an undisclosed end-point in his journey, then turned around and started to return home.
	
	
	The driving occurred about 4 hours after taking the stilnox. Dr Perl gave evidence about the half-life of stilnox and expressed the opinion, which does not appear controversial, that most of the effects of the zolpidem would have been concentrated much earlier in time.
	



	
	There are other unsatisfactory aspects of the accused's evidence, including the following:
	



	
	The accused denies any knowledge of any risks or warnings associated with the use of stilnox, despite a number of high profile media campaigns over a number of years, and despite there being stringent legal obligations on those who prescribed and dispensed the stilnox to him over 10 years. It is difficult to accept, in particular, that so many health professionals could have been so derelict in their duties for so long as to not provide him with those warnings.
	
	
	The accused claims he had 3 previous incidents suggestive of parasomnia which he never followed up on, including one which apparently resulted in a significant injury to him. It is difficult to accept that although he is obviously intelligent, yet he made no further inquiries, and took the matters no further. Even when he was told by a doctor that it might have been the stilnox, he claims that he asked no further questions and made no further investigations.
	
	
	It is difficult to accept that Dr Pickles, one of his treating physicians, had not taken the matter any further after the report to her of an episode of possible stilnox-related parasomnia, and, despite the extant warnings, had not taken him off it or made further investigation at all.
	
	
	It is deeply implausible that despite allegedly having suffered harm as a result of the lack of proper medical oversight, including during the collision that has led to these charges, he continues to go to the same medical practitioners even to this day.
	
	
	It is difficult to accept that even when stilnox was freshly prescribed to him by his GP in 2014, after a long period during which he did not use that drug, still he was never given any warnings about it, and no investigations were made or questions asked about the potential for adverse reactions.
	
	
	The evidence the accused gave about his involvement with Camp Quality, in particular his explanation for why the nature of that evidence changed after being served with the statement of Peta Kennedy, was less than satisfactory.
	
	
	His explanation for why his car was parked on the street in the way that it was, despite being so far out of registration, was also less than satisfactory.
	
	
	It is noteworthy that there is nothing in the medical notes that were tendered which indicated a loss of memory, even though such a thing would plainly be medically significant.
	



	
	However, having noted those matters, on the other hand I note:
	



	
	At 0.110, his level of intoxication was certainly not so high that one would ordinarily expect a person to have a significant amount of amnesia; nor is it so high as to make likely a single-car, low speed collision with a stationary object on a relatively straight piece of road, such as the accused had.
	
	
	There is, as the defence have pointed out, no evidence to contradict the accused's sworn claim that he had no memory of the driving. There is for example nothing in the medical notes that have been tendered. As I have noted elsewhere, it was open to the prosecution to obtain all medical records relating to the accused's hospitalisation, as well as to his transport in the ambulance, but that was not done.
	
	
	Given that the accused could and did walk to a licensed premises earlier in the night, it seems largely inexplicable that he would then be voluntarily out in his car at 3.00 in the morning, after having gone to bed. Although there are some suggestions in the brief that he was in possession of a receipt from the Dee Why RSL club, that receipt was not put into evidence, and there is absolutely no evidence before me to suggest that he was at that club at any time relevant to the issues before the Court.
	



	
	As I have already observed, I share many of the prosecution's skepticisms, both about the underlying body of evidence supporting the existence of zolpidem-induced parasomnia, and about the evidence of the accused which would lead to a conclusion that he was in such a state at the time of these offences. My view is very far indeed from Dr Moses' opinion that it is ""very likely"" he was in such a state. Those skepticisms, though, ultimately do not go so far as to exclude the reasonable possibility that it is true. I return always to the onus and burden of proof, and in this case, taking into account all of the evidence, it remains in my mind a reasonable possibility, albeit a remote one indeed, that the accused was not acting voluntarily at the time of driving, and accordingly, I find him not guilty of all charges.

		02 December 2015",2015-09-28 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2426176,R v Thoral [2015] NSWDC 263,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: At about 2.20 am on Thursday 7 August 2014 two police officers, Constables Hicks and Burnell were driving along the Pacific Highway at Lindfield. They stopped another car being driven by Karas Costas after they saw it turn out of Balfour Street onto the Pacific Highway and head north. The accused, Alexander Thoral was in the passenger seat.
	
	
	A search of the vehicle revealed a number of things which later proved to be connected to a break enter and steal offence of Christophe’s Patisserie, a cake shop situated about 20 metres away from where the car was first seen. These things included a padded post office bag addressed to “Christophe’s Patisserie, 364 Pacific Highway, Lindfield”, three flat head screwdrivers (described as Phillips head screwdrivers by one police officer,) three unopened Coca Cola bottles which were still cold and had condensation on the outside, two Berri orange juice bottles, one of which was unopened and still cold and had condensation on the outside and the other being empty with a small amount of juice at the bottom, a quiche, and several meringues which were on the back seat without being in any form of packaging.
	
	
	Other police arrived. When police visited the location of the patisserie they discovered that it had been broken into. The door had been forced, and jemmy marks on the door were, from my observations, capable of being made by a flat headed screwdriver. Inside police found a fridge which contained Coca Cola bottles and Berri orange juice bottles identical to those found in the car and the door to that fridge was open. Police also found items for sale identical to the quiche and meringues found on the back seat of the car. Indeed one police officer expressed the unchallenged opinion that some meringues appeared to be missing from the top of the counter. Ms Pang, the proprietor, later told police when she inspected the premises she found that bottles of Coke, bottles of orange juice, some meringues and a quiche were missing.
	
	
	It could not seriously be suggested, and Mr Townsend who appears for the accused did not suggest it, that the items found in the car were not the proceeds of the offence of break enter and steal committed on Christophe’s Patisserie.
	
	
	The issue for me to decide in this judge alone trial is whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was criminally involved in that offence.
	
	
	Before I discuss the evidence called in the trial and the conclusions which I draw from it I will set out some preliminary matters. They are the sorts of things that I would tell a jury where there is a trial when a jury decide the guilt or otherwise of the accused. I will determine all relevant issues of fact according to the evidence. The evidence in this case is made up of what witnesses said in court and the exhibits which have been tendered. I have made no enquiries of any kind about anything that came up in this trial. Both the Crown and the accused are entitled to my judgment free of prejudice and sympathy. In particular some of the police evidence suggested that the accused was a man who was known to them. Some evidence referred to other suspicious activity of the accused which the Crown said was relevant to some matter appearing later on a s 166 certificate. I have not used the fact that the police apparently knew the accused or the material later to be relevant to the matter on the s 166 certificate against the accused in any way. I heard evidence that the accused exercised his right to silence when he declined an interview by police. No adverse inference can be drawn from the fact that the accused declined to be interviewed and I do not use that in any way at all against him. The accused did not give evidence. I have also not used that in any way against him. The accused was entitled to say nothing in court. The fact that the accused did not give evidence does not effect the fundamental proposition which I must apply, namely that the Crown has to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The most important and fundamental principle of law which I apply concerns the onus and standard of proof. Because this is a criminal trial the burden of proving the guilt of the accused is placed firmly on the Crown. The accused starts from a position that he is presumed to be innocent and that presumption continues until the Crown satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt he is guilty.
	
	
	Quite clearly the case against the accused is a circumstantial one, no one saw him break and enter Christophe’s Patisserie, no one heard him say that he intended to or had broken into the shop. Instead the Crown relies on a number of circumstances which she suggests demonstrate the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Of course the corollary of the idea that the Crown has to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is that if there is a reasonable version inconsistent with guilt then the accused must be acquitted.
	
	
	Given that it is clear that at least one of the occupants of the car had committed the offence of break enter and steal the Crown has to satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that it was either the accused acting alone who committed the offence or the accused and Mr Costas acting as part of a joint criminal enterprise. Thus if there is a reasonable possibility that Mr Costas committed the offence without the criminal involvement of the accused then I would find the accused not guilty.
	
	
	Both the accused and Mr Costas explain the accused’s presence in the car by telling police that Mr Costas had just picked up the accused from Chatswood Railway Station. Mr Costas explained where he was in Lindfield by telling police, in the presence of the accused, that he and the accused were going home to Ashfield. The accused also told police that they were on their way home. When asked why they were on Balfour Street which was 20 metres away from where the shop was located Mr Costas said, again in the presence of the accused, that they wanted to buy something from a Coles supermarket and there was a Coles supermarket on Balfour Street.
	
	
	Although there was evidence that there were no trains running to Chatswood Railway Station at that time in the morning it is important to understand that whilst the police were told that the accused was picked up at the railway station neither Mr Costas nor the accused said the accused got a train to that location. It is also important to note that whilst there was evidence that Coles supermarkets close at midnight, again there was no suggestion that this was understood by the accused or Mr Costas.
	
	
	However I am satisfied that the explanation given did not in any way explain the presence of the car driven by Mr Costas in a location very close to where the patisserie had been broken into. One of the versions of events inconsistent with guilt postulated by the accused is that Mr Costas committed the offence, then drove from Lindfield to Chatswood where he picked up the accused and then returned to within 20 metres of the patisserie so that they could go to a Coles store. It is inconceivable that a person having broken into premises, having some of the proceeds of that offence clearly on display in the car, and having driven some suburbs away to pick up another person, would then return to a location so close to where he committed the break enter and steal offence simply to go to a supermarket, especially when there would be many supermarkets between Chatswood Railway Station and Ashfield where they were ultimately headed. This is particularly the case where it was the intention of the two men, so Mr Costas said, to go from Chatswood to Ashfield. The suburb where the car was stopped, Lindfield, is in the opposite direction.
	
	
	Further when the car came out of Balfour Street it did not turn south in the direction of Ashfield, it turned north. I appreciate that people do not always act logically but to postulate a scenario where Mr Costas, having broken into the cake shop and having driven to Chatswood Railway Station to pick up the accused, then returns to near the scene of the crime, thus heading away from his desired destination and making it more likely that the police would notice the incriminating items in the car and would be able to connect him to the offence committed on the cake shop is so illogical that I reject this as an impossible version of events.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt therefore that when police observed the motor vehicle for the first time the shop had only recently been broken into. I am fortified in that conclusion by observations made of the temperature of the drink bottles and condensation appearing on those bottles. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Costas did not break into the shop and steal items from it and then go to pick up the accused.
	
	
	Another version of events inconsistent with guilt which I must consider did involve the accused being in the car, but not in any way participating in the break enter and steal offence. Mr Townsend emphasised the lack of any forensic evidence such as fingerprints or DNA found on any of the proceeds of the offence, or in the premises, or on the screwdrivers which appear to have been used to force entry. They are, as I said, flat head screwdrivers easily capable of making the damage on the door of the cake shop as shown in photograph number two.
	
	
	Mr Townsend suggests that there is no evidence that the offender was criminally involved in the offence at all. Whilst it maybe a possibility, perhaps even a reasonable possibility, that a person would commit a break enter and steal offence whilst a companion of his remain seated nearby in the car minding his own business, I do not consider this was a reasonable possibility in the circumstances of this case. While some of the property was found on the back seat of the car a number of relevant items were found in the foot well of the front passenger seat where the accused was seated. These include the flat head screwdrivers, the drink bottles, one of which had been opened and the contents consumed, the envelope addressed to the Lindfield bakery and a padded post office bag addressed to Christophe’s Patisserie. This tends to suggest that one person, Mr Costas, put the quiche and the meringues in the back seat of the car and another, the accused, placed the other property in the foot well. Further, the property taken from the patisserie was more than one person could comfortably carry in one trip and of course the most important circumstance is that people committing offences do not usually want an audience.
	
	
	I do not believe that there it is reasonably possible that Mr Costas broke into the shop alone, made two or more trips from the shop to the car carrying items he had stolen from it, placed those two items in two different locations within the car, including the front passenger seat foot well where the accused was sitting, all without the accused being part of a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Costas.
	
	
	When I carefully consider the circumstances relied on by the Crown I am satisfied that there is no reasonable version of events which is inconsistent with the accused’s guilt. I am thus satisfied that either the accused or Mr Costas, a person with whom he was acting in a joint criminal enterprise, broke into the cake shop, entered into it and took property from the shop with the intention of stealing. Accordingly I find the accused guilty of the charge on the indictment.

		10 November 2015",2015-09-28 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2426301,R v A2; R v Magennis; R v Vaziri (No. 15) [2015] NSWSC 1545,"Judgment (on objection by the accused magennis to tender of evidence concerning the accused magennis’ registration and employment history in new south wales as a nurse and midwife - t1316)


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown seeks to adduce evidence in this trial, against the Accused Magennis, with respect to particulars of her registration as a nurse and midwife in New South Wales and evidence, such as it is, of her places of employment over a period which spanned 1998 to 2003.
	
	
	Objection is taken by the Accused Magennis’ counsel to the tender of this material upon the basis of relevance.
	
	
	The Crown contends that the material is relevant for two purposes.
	
	
	Firstly, it is submitted that the work history of the Accused Magennis, and her registration as a nurse and midwife, is relevant to the charges of female genital mutilation (“FGM”) brought against her in that they point to some training and skills in dealing with girls in the genital area. The Crown alleges that FGM occurred here by way of “khatna” which, on the Crown case, involved injury to each girl.
	
	
	Secondly, the Crown seeks to point to a regular period of registration of the Accused Magennis as a nurse and midwife, and her regular employment in the New South Wales health system, in light of the general evidence of Ms Vivienne Strong and Ms Linda George concerning the education programme concerning FGM which was undertaken for health professionals (including nurses and midwives) in New South Wales from 1998.
	
	
	Although the Crown cannot point to any direct evidence that the Accused Magennis attended any seminar or lecture with respect to FGM as provided to health professionals, the Crown submits that an inference is available that through that program, available over a number of years, the subject matter of the material would have come to the Accused Magennis’ attention.
	
	
	At the outset, I should observe that there is evidence before the jury from Detective Sergeant Stek that the Accused Magennis is a registered nurse and midwife (T259, T293). I touched upon that evidence and other material relied upon by the Crown, in the course of R v A2; R v Magennis; R v Vaziri (No. 7) [2015] NSWSC 1427, which concerned an objection to the tender of evidence from Ms Strong and Ms George about the New South Wales FGM Education Program. In that judgment, at [8], I referred to material, before me on the voir dire, some of which is now tendered for the purpose of the trial.
	
	
	I take into account the observations I made in R v A2; R v Magennis; R v Vaziri (No. 7) as to the suggested relevance and utility of this material. I note that since that judgment was delivered on 28 September 2015, Ms Strong and Ms George have actually given evidence and it is the fact that there is no direct evidence demonstrating that the Accused Magennis attended a FGM lecture or seminar.
	
	
	The test of relevance under s.55 Evidence Act 1995 involves a relatively low threshold. In this respect, I refer to R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 3) [2015] NSWSC 1264 at [13]ff. To be admissible as relevant evidence, the evidence is to be considered upon the basis that if it were accepted by the jury, it could rationally affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.
	
	
	It is submitted by Mr Bouveng that the bare information already in evidence from Detective Sergeant Stek is sufficient, in that there is some evidence of the registration of the Accused Magennis as a nurse and midwife so that that fact is already before the jury.
	
	
	With respect to the first basis relied upon by the Crown, I am satisfied that evidence of what is the most complete picture of the registration history as a nurse and midwife of the Accused Magennis, and her work history, is relevant to a fact in issue in this trial.
	
	
	As I have observed in earlier judgments, the central contest in the trial is whether what occurred here was the performance of a FGM procedure causing injury to some extent to each girl or, on the competing version as put for the Accused persons, whether this was a symbolic ceremony involving the laying on of a metal object without injury: R v A2; R v Magennis; R v Vaziri (No. 7) at [21]-[22].
	
	
	The fact that the person who was undertaking the particular acts was a trained and experienced nurse and midwife may bear upon that question in the mind of the jury. A bare symbolic procedure on the one hand, it might be thought, could be performed by anyone. Something involving a measure of interference with the female genital area may, it might be thought, involve and be assisted by some skill. I mention these things not for the purpose of expressing any view, but to pose at least an available use of this evidence.
	
	
	In my view, the length of experience and registration and the places at which the Accused Magennis worked are relevant.
	
	
	The second aspect relied upon by the Crown involves the question as to whether an inference might be drawn by the jury (being a matter for the jury and not me), as to whether the relatively intensive education program undertaken as part of the New South Wales FGM Education Program, could have come to the attention of the Accused Magennis, even if she was not on a list of attendees. The fact that she had worked, it would seem, in the New South Wales public health system, from time to time and in different places, may allow an inference to be drawn that that information came to her attention, even if the Crown cannot place her at a seminar or lecture on the topic. Once again, in making that statement I am not making any finding, I am merely pointing to a way in which this evidence could assist the jury.
	
	
	Of course, the jury ultimately will be considering the issues in the trial, by reference to all the evidence. The issue for the moment involves the relatively undemanding test of relevance in ss.55 and 56.
	
	
	Insofar as a submission was made by Mr Bouveng that some of this evidence is very generalised, that it places the Accused Magennis at a particular hospital and at a particular time but without any detailed information about the nature of her employment at different hospitals, I note that the inference is available, supported to an extent by direct evidence with respect to Liverpool Hospital, that the Accused Magennis was employed as a nurse. Her qualifications as a nurse and midwife, and her continuing registration and re-registration as a nurse and midwife over a number of years, may permit an inference to be drawn that that is precisely the work that she was undertaking.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose to admit the evidence which the Crown seeks to adduce with respect to the registration and employment history of the Accused Magennis.
	
	
	Having said that, it is highly desirable that this evidence be adduced in some straightforward and coherent fashion. In making this ruling, I am not indicating that all the documents in MFI70 ought be admitted in this form.
	
	
	I trust that there may be some simpler way of adducing evidence on these issues, but I leave that matter to counsel.

		19 February 2016",2015-10-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2426305,R v PETERS [2015] NSWDC 325,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Jacob John Peters today appears for sentence in relation to an offence to which he pleaded guilty at the Local Court, and pleads guilty in this court, of wounding Andrew Lotherington with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to him on 21 January 2014 at Bathurst.
	
	
	This is an offence contrary to s 33(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900. It has a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of seven years imprisonment. There are no matters on a Form 1 or “related matters” on a s 166 certificate, but there are matters for which the prisoner was charged subsequent to the events giving rise to the charge that I am concerned with, that I need to consider in the context of the case that is being conducted, particularly by the accused, or, on his behalf.
	
	
	The plea of guilty was clearly entered at the first reasonable opportunity and it is agreed between the parties that the prisoner should receive a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence, in accordance with the guideline of the Court of Criminal Appeal from 1999 of Thomson and Houlton, to recognise the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty entered.
	
	
	I have already indicated to the prisoner the sentence I propose ordering and I would ask that my introductory remarks to him form part of this judgment on sentence. The prisoner appears before me in custody, however, there have been broken periods of custody. The prisoner was granted Supreme Court bail, as I understand it, in 2014 by Hidden J, primarily, as I would understand it, to permit the prisoner to enter into a rehabilitation centre.
	
	
	There is a deal of evidence before me about his entry to Odyssey House, his departure from Odyssey House, his return to Odyssey House, his return to custody at various times, and then, subsequently, his release to another rehabilitation centre in the Windsor/Richmond area. This is a centre that I have not heard of before. Not that that means anything. It is called One80TC, which has the “slogan” of “Turning Lives Around”, being a type of ‘faith-based’ rehabilitation program.
	
	
	The prisoner has been discharged from each of those programs at various times and returned to custody, as I am informed, when he appeared in the District Court in August 2015. It must be fairly said in that context that, whilst he did not continue at the respective rehabilitation centres during the remand period as I understand the matter he has not committed further offences.
	
	
	I have taken into account evidence of his sister and evidence from the prisoner about the more settled lifestyle he has had within those programs or at large living with his sister since being charged in relation to the current matter. In any event, what I have just outlined leads to the point that I am informed by the Crown, accepted by the defence that as of yesterday there was six months and ten days of presentence custody, not continuous, which I am required to take into account and I certainly do.
	
	
	It was agreed that I should date any sentence I impose from 5 April 2015. It was accepted in the course of the conduct of the case by learned counsel for the prisoner that, notwithstanding s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”), that nothing other than a term of imprisonment could be imposed in relation to this matter, having regard to the character of the offending and the maximum penalty and, of course, those relevant provisions relating to standard non-parole periods reflecting upon the availability of non-custodial sentences.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are set out in a statement of facts which are not stated to be an agreed statement of facts but certainly are not the subject of any objection. I point out in relation to Mr Peters, as I understand the matter, that he was born in November 1991, the relevant events occurring in January 2014. This means that he was 22 at the time of the offending and he will turn, as I would understand it, 24 years of age in November this year.
	
	
	There is some background that is not in the facts that I have taken into account; particularly as I find from the evidence that the prisoner, prior to the commission of the offending, had been a user of methylamphetamine, sometimes referred to in the evidence here as “ice”. Most particularly the facts speak of the prisoner on 21 January 2014 being seen at, firstly, an address in Larson Street, Bathurst, when armed with a knife, acting in a, if not bizarre fashion, certainly in an aggressive fashion.
	
	
	He certainly knew the occupant of the address at Larson Street Bathurst. There is some suggestion, I hasten to say in the material, amongst the people that I am referring to at this point that he saw before he stabbed the victim sometime after 11.16pm, were people from whom he purchased drugs. Although that is not made clear in the statement of facts.
	
	
	The prisoner at the address at Larson Street used the knife to “stab” the mesh of a screen security door. He then moved to another address at 241 Peel Street, Bathurst - I point out, from my understanding of the matter from the charge sheet and other material, the prisoner, himself, actually lived in Peel Street at the relevant time, but at 116 Peel Street, Bathurst.
	
	
	That particular premises had CCTV footage. Why it had CCTV cameras in operation I do not know. He knew the occupants of the addresses. By this stage he was “moderately to well affected by alcohol” and was in possession of a large bottle of alcohol and also was in possession of two knives, one being what is called a black-and-green paring-style knife. One of the occupants took the knives off the prisoner.
	
	
	The prisoner was wearing particular clothing, set out in the facts, which was of assistance in ultimately identifying him as the attacker from CCTV camera footage obtained from the taxi cab near where the victim was standing when he was ultimately stabbed thus giving rise to the charge.
	
	
	Police were contacted while the prisoner was at Peel Street because of his behaviour and what would appear to be an altercation occurring between he and one of the occupants of the premises. When he left the premises he was in view of the closed-circuit television camera and the facts state that he was heard to say while making a telephone call, I assume, on a mobile phone, “I’m going to stab someone”.
	
	
	The prisoner, by this stage, had collected the two knives that had been taken from him and walked towards a location in Bathurst called Rocket Street. Unfortunately, at about 11.20pm, the victim Andrew Lotherington, who was accompanying his wife, was returning home in a taxi cab and getting out of the taxi cab to go into his residence. Mr Lotherington and/or his wife were in the process of paying the fare.
	
	
	The prisoner appears to have approached the taxi and screamed at the front passenger window - I take that to be not necessarily directing whatever he screamed at Mr Lotherington or his wife. The prisoner walked to the rear of the taxi, the victim, then having paid the fare, got out of the taxi cab but he walked towards the prisoner who was standing at the rear of the vehicle, this time at about 11.27pm, and said, “Mate, what’s your problem?”. At this point the prisoner was holding a knife in his right hand and, as the facts state, he struck the victim without warning or provocation.
	
	
	It should be clearly understood I am not in any way blaming the victim. But, notwithstanding the evidence of the prisoner’s conduct before and the prisoner’s comment about “going to stab someone”, it is unfortunate, at least for Mr Lotherington and no doubt the community, as well as the prisoner, that the prisoner was approached at that point. Because I could not conclude on the evidence available to me, that the prisoner targeted Mr Lotherington particularly beforehand.
	
	
	In light of his bizarre behaviour in screaming at the passenger side of the taxi cab, I could not conclude that if Mr Lotherington had got out of the cab and walked straight to his home the prisoner would have followed him and stabbed him in a manner similar to that giving rise to the facts in the case.
	
	
	It leads me to the conclusion that, notwithstanding the earlier statement of the prisoner, I am satisfied that his act in stabbing the victim was impulsive. It was, of course, without provocation. There was an absence of planning in it, although he was armed with a knife. The truth of the matter is, of course, given his earlier statement, the prisoner was a near and present danger to anyone who did confront him. As I said, that is what Mr Lotherington did, and I do not suggest for a moment in an aggressive fashion.
	
	
	The knife punched into the left chest of the victim. This is of course very significant, given on the left side of the chest is to be found the heart. There is no evidence the prisoner aimed at the heart. He is not charged with intent to murder, and given his quite heavy intoxication, which I accept to be so, his physical capacity of deliberating upon a particular place was significantly impaired. But, of course, not so impaired as to prevent him forming the relevant intention for the offence.
	
	
	In the Victim Impact Statement from Mr Lotherington, my view a very measured, unemotional document representing reasonably what one would expect from such a horrific experience, there is a photograph of Mr Lotherington’s chest with what appears to be a scar representing the stitches imposed in the chest.
	
	
	The facts state that the knife penetrated the top of the victim’s stomach, narrowly missing his heart and lung. Fortunately for Mr Lotherington, he spent only two days in hospital, received sutures for the wound and apparently needed no other surgery, although gas from the lung had entered the stomach region of the victim which would cause him considerable discomfort.
	
	
	The facts state that many of the matters to which I refer were captured by the taxi’s closed-circuit television system. The prisoner is observed, at least his clothing, in that recording and that, ultimately, led to the identification of him as the offender. He was not identified as the offender that night or early the next morning; the prisoner left the scene and visited a family member in Kelso where he was seen to be well-affected by alcohol.
	
	
	He then was put in a cab and sent to 16 Hamley Street in Bathurst where were present his sister, who gave evidence before me, and the prisoner’s former partner, now the mother of his child to be born later this year. This woman, as I understand it, is older than the prisoner and has two children from other relationships.
	
	
	The prisoner, when he arrived at Hamley Street, Bathurst, this is at about 2.30 am, was well-affected by alcohol and had an argument with his sister and his partner. In relation to that argument, ultimately the prisoner committed a number of offences which he was charged with later that day, that is, 22 January 2014.
	
	
	Police were called to arrest him, but, at that stage, police had not made a connection between the prisoner and the unfortunate Mr Lotherington’s attacker. No doubt Mr Lotherington was at the hospital at this point being treated. The prisoner apparently was not arrested until sometime later in relation to the matter with which I am concerned.
	
	
	I have read the facts that relate to the matters giving rise to the charges brought for events after the stabbing. Of course, that criminal conduct is not relevant in this sentencing exercise to the objective circumstances of the offending, but the prisoner’s later conduct is relevant in this sense: it shows him to be not only in a highly agitated state but very heavily intoxicated and acting, as his sister described it, “crazily”, or acting “crazy”; I do not have a precise transcript of her evidence.
	
	
	I note from the evidence that it would seem, in the context of the prisoner’s conduct, that the prisoner, himself, was punched and kneed and pushed to the ground by both his then-partner and his sister, no doubt to try and subdue him in some way. But what is important, apart from what the sister has said in evidence before me and what the facts reveal about his uncharacteristic bizarre behaviour at his sister’s, or girlfriend’s, place was the observation of him by police.
	
	
	When the prisoner, sometime after 2.30 am, was taken to the custody manager, he was deemed to be under the influence of either intoxicating liquor or a drug, and therefore was given a ‘time-out’. He was given a time-out of six hours. But even then he was still unable to be interviewed after that period, as he was still displaying signs of impairment. It demonstrates how affected he was at the time of his presence at Hamley Street, and I am prepared to accept, reflecting upon blood alcohol absorption levels and the like, that he was similarly affected when he stabbed Mr Lotherington.
	
	
	His intoxication, of course, is not a mitigating factor; clearly that is so, but, as his counsel correctly pointed-out, it is a relevant matter to take into account in assessing the factual mix and it is relevant to making the assessment I have that his conduct was, in some respects certainly uncharacteristic and impulsive and without planning, even though over a period of some hours he was armed with a knife.
	
	
	The knife itself was recovered and DNA testing was undertaken and the profile of the offender was identified as being on the knife handle and it was concluded, from what I understand, that the knife that has been photographed was the knife used. It was similar in dimension to the size of the wound and that knife would appear to be some type of work knife as I would understand its purpose.
	
	
	The prisoner was arrested on 1 May and interviewed. I have not seen the interview. What he admitted to related to matters that assisted in identifying him as the attacker; there is no mention of him admitting to stabbing the victim. But, then again, given his degree of intoxication, certainly from alcohol and likely from ingestion of methylamphetamine, lack of memory does not represent, necessarily, avoidance by him of his responsibility.
	
	
	The prisoner has a criminal history which dates back quite a number of years for one so young. He first appeared in the Children’s Court in 2005 and then has had a number of appearances. One of the problems, and I am not criticising the Crown, is the way the material came before me. The criminal history is what is called a ‘bail report’, it is not a proper criminal history. It basically records every appearance in court, whether convictions or findings of guilt were recorded. So, whilst that extends to quite a number of pages, there is quite a deal of repetition in it.
	
	
	Primarily the offender’s criminal history in the Children’s Court and the Local Court representing offences relating to the management of motor vehicles and minor dishonesty. He does have findings of guilt in the Children’s Court for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, an offence, as I would understand it, committed when he was 14 years of age, of which he received probation, and a finding of guilt in relation to the offence of assault in 2010, for which he was placed on a control order with a non-parole period of three months. The facts of those matters are not made clear to me.
	
	
	He was not subject to probation or parole and was not otherwise on conditional liberty. In fact, one of the things I noticed about his criminal history is that after the time he appeared in the Children’s Court in 2010, he had one other appearance in the Local Court for another common assault but for which he was fined a very modest amount. That was in March 2012, so up until 2014 there is almost a four-year break in his offending but for that other assault matter.
	
	
	The Crown submitted (I was not quite sure if this was pressed because I do not have a transcript) that his criminal history was an aggravating factor. In my view I could not conclude his criminal history as an aggravating factor in this matter having regard to the character of the offending. He has a number of findings of guilt, that is true, some in the Local Court, mainly in the Children’s Court. But I need to consider breaks in offending and I also have to factor in the reality that the crime with which he is now charged is by far and away the most serious crime he has ever faced.
	
	
	Accepting his sister’s evidence, his behaviour on this night and the level of violence he demonstrated was, essentially, uncharacteristic on his part and was fuelled, it would seem, by whatever he had ingested. I point out in his histories to psychologists and the Community Corrections Service he speaks of ingestion of drugs as contributing to his offending behaviour, as best he can work it out.
	
	
	There is no independent evidence apart from what he said about that matter. Perhaps the police observation that he was affected by alcohol and drugs assists in that regard. But it is quite clear that he was heavily intoxicated by alcohol, judging from the observations of people who saw him earlier in the evening and his possession of alcohol at a particular time.
	
	
	I have a deal of material relating to the consequences for the victim in the victim impact statement; It was a measured document. For example, there is no attempt by him to gild the lily; his summary, to quote him, is “at the end of the day I know it was a one-off non-targeted attack”. So far as his effect upon his attitude and his demeanour, he wrote; “Mild effect on general happiness”.
	
	
	This is a considered response. However, he also reflects upon the pain suffered for a number of months after the event, although, it would seem he has physically recovered his health. There has been a longstanding emotional impact upon him which still remains; he has sought counselling, properly so, and continues to undertake counselling.
	
	
	He has become very concerned about the security of himself and his wife. I do not believe he has anything to fear from the prisoner; I do not believe the prisoner presents any particular threat to him. In fact, I would be very surprised if the prisoner, other than seeing Mr Lotherington in court, would even remember what Mr Lotherington looked like. But the security of Mr Lotherington and his wife has been compromised.
	
	
	It has affected his social arrangements. He is concerned that this sort of thing can happen again. They are worried about their security. I bear in mind, of course, as the Crown pointed out, this was an attack on Mr Lotherington that occurred in the presence of the wife. So it was not only harmful to Mr Lotherington and shocking to him, it would have been terribly shocking and, I would imagine, at least emotionally harmful, for the wife who had to come to her husband’s aid and assist him.
	
	
	No doubt she is a third party victim, so to speak, or a second party victim compromised by the prisoner’s actions. Having said that, there is no evidence the prisoner was aware of the wife’s presence and the extent of which he had any particular awareness of the presence of anyone other than the driver in the taxi cab is not entirely clear. At least until Mr Lotherington got out of the car.
	
	
	With regard to the presentence report of Community Corrections, it reflects upon a background of dysfunction and violence. The prisoner’s parents, as the history he gave to the psychologist reveals, separated when the prisoner was about four. The prisoner, for a period of time, apparently lived with his mother but then moved to live with his father. There is a reflection upon the fact that his parents lived what was described as “an antisocial” existence, and it is sad to report that his mother died of a drug overdose in 2011. In fact, the prisoner speaks, in the psychological report, of his last telephone call to her being a somewhat bitter exchange, given the fact that she had put down, for one reason or another, a dog of the prisoner she was looking after.
	
	
	In any event, the prisoner moved from his mother to the care of his father and now has a good relationship with his father, although his father had been violent in the house in which he lived with his family until he separated from the mother.
	
	
	The prisoner is said in the presentence report to have a very good work record notwithstanding the fact he left school in year 9 and had a somewhat dislocated education. He is a concreter and a bricklayer, he has worked in another work as well. At one point he moved to Western Australia and set-up a bricklaying business, which he was able to run for about six months before he returned to New South Wales.
	
	
	He went to Odyssey House to address his substance abuse issues whilst on bail, as I mentioned. He was discharged from that program for “threatening behaviour”, on the records of the Odyssey House people. He went back eventually to the One80TC rehabilitation program in 2015 as a condition of his bail, but again he was discharged from that program, as I would understand it, in August 2015, which led to his bail being refused.
	
	
	He had problems with his attitude to staff. He explained in his evidence before me, which I have taken into account, that one of the problems at Odyssey House was that he was given a physical job to do that involved concreting which he enjoyed and was skilled at, but he was taken off the job with no explanation. I am prepared to accept his evidence that his departure from Odyssey House, in part, was through no fault of his but may well be a reflection upon his general demeanour.
	
	
	He likes to get his own way it would seem. But, then again, he might not have been unreasonable in thinking that, in relation to aspects of the matter he was somewhat in the right. The problem he had in relation to that program, as with the other program, is that he was an inmate at the direction of the staff of that program and it would seem to me - bearing in mind he was on bail granted by the Supreme Court, he had no option but to follow the directions given to him. I will not hold it against him, though as a matter that suggests that he is not amenable to direction in the future.
	
	
	I just pause for a moment.
	
	
	Mr Crown, Mr Walsh, it wasn’t the subject of address but it’s just dawned on me as I deliver these remarks, bearing in mind I am reading from the material, I don’t have a transcript and I haven’t prepared a written judgment, I should give the prisoner some credit for his quasi-custodial rehabilitation program presence.
	
	
	WALSH: That's right.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: The law is quite clear on this: if a person is in a residential program, as the superior courts, the Court of Criminal Appeal have held, a court may give a discount of perhaps up to 50%. When I say discount, a recognition of up to 50% of the time spent in a residential facility as a “quasi custodial setting”. I’d be grateful to hear some submissions when I finish my remarks as to what period I might give credit to the prisoner, because it would require me to backdate the sentence I impose if I am prepared to do so to a date earlier than 5 April.
	
	
	WALSH: Thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Do you understand what I’m saying, Mr Crown?
	
	
	CLAYTON: Yes, I do, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: It wasn’t a matter referred to in the submissions, I didn’t pick it up, and it’s just occurred to me as I read from the presentence report that I should give him some recognition for that if it’s agreed between the parties or if it’s proper to do so.
	
	
	In any event, I have noted what’s been said about his departure from those programs in that regard. Beggars cannot be choosers, Mr Peters should understand that is true in gaol as well as in residential programs. One just has to comply with the directions, and, as the prisoner has chosen, you can leave the program if you’re not happy with the way it works.
	
	
	There are some other significant matters referred to in the presentence report, also referred to in the psychological report that are relevant in this matter. The circumstances are not entirely clear but it is the fact, as I understand it from the evidence, the prisoner has been present on two occasions: in 2007 and 2008, when two friends were killed, apparently in violent acts, apparently one of them, at least, was stabbed. According to the presentence report, he, in fact tried to give CPR to one of those persons who had been “knifed”.
	
	
	Of course, whenever one is dealing with people who are addicted to drugs or are prone to violence, one is always astonished when one reads that the person in question has been a victim of violence or has lived in a family environment where drugs were widely used and has seen the harmful effects of them. This prisoner has seen the latter because his mother has died of a drug overdose. One wonders why one would, in those circumstances where one is horrified, for example, by violence committed against the person or committed in the person’s presence, resort to violence on other occasions. But it is a common fact that that occurs.
	
	
	I am also advised in the presentence report that the prisoner has some security problems in the wider community. He is fearful of violence being inflicted upon him. He also is on protection in custody. I heard no details about this by way of submission or in evidence, but the presentence report states that he is on protection and he fears for his safety. I have taken that matter into account as best I can as a relevant matter, given I do not know the detail of what that protection is from official Corrective Services records.
	
	
	He explained his regret and remorse for the offence with which I am concerned. He is shocked at what he did. He claimed that he was not “really a violent person”. He could not work out why he did what he did and, no doubt, one of the major contributing factors was that he was disinhibited or greatly affected by the alcohol and/or drugs that he had taken.
	
	
	He is at medium high risk to re-offending, which accords with the assessment of the psychologist. He has a back problem which, as I remember it from the material available to me, affected his brick-laying career.
	
	
	There is some suggestion of mental health issues, in the sense that he has been treated with some medication in custody. Whether it is reactive to his current circumstances, and the like, I have no evidence clearly to demonstrate. But certainly he has a background prior to committing the offence of feelings of grief and anxiety and symptoms of depression.
	
	
	I have referred to the fact that his former partner’s expecting a child whose welfare, of course, he would be concerned about, although he could not be, even if at large, practically involved, it would seem, in the care of the child on a permanent basis. The Community Corrections Service Assessment was that he has been able to rise above negative influences and a disadvantaged background and he has endeavoured to address his substance abuse, both attending the rehabilitation programs that I am concerned with from the evidence, but also some rehabilitation program undertaken before he committed the current offence.
	
	
	He needs to address his anger management, of course, and he clearly has unresolved issues from his past, including the “haunting residual of his own violent offending”, as it is expressed in the report, asking himself why he did it. He will need assistance from Community Corrections to address substance abuse, mental health matters, and also to ensure he gets psychological intervention.
	
	
	I have reports from One80TC, one in May, one in September. They do not tell me a great deal, other than the character of the program. I accept that he was involved in that program genuinely but parts of the program ultimately did not appeal to him, hence he was discharged. I have also had regard to a psychological report prepared, it would seem, whilst he was at the One80TC program. It is a very short report. It notes his poly-substance use “Disorder”, but also notes “symptoms of complex trauma response”, noting intrusive thoughts and nightmares related to life experiences, anxiety and depression, and the use of drugs and alcohol to manage these symptoms, which is not an uncommon occurrence.
	
	
	He has symptoms that are consistent with the criteria for a diagnosis for post-traumatic stress disorder arising out of life experiences, particularly the violent death of his friends in his presence. These are findings consistent with the helpful report from the psychologist retained by the defence, Ms Talmacs, employed by Duffy Robilliard Psychologists, a respectable organisation that provides many reports for the courts, both for Crown and defence.
	
	
	I have already surveyed much of the prisoner’s history, some of that survey includes reference to the history given in this report. The prisoner reports to the psychologist, who prepared this report, generally good health. Although he has been knocked unconscious a few times as a child.
	
	
	The way he behaved at school with the prisoner being a person with undiagnosed Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; he has trouble controlling his anger, he believed his parents suffered from anxiety and depression. If his mother was drug addicted, no doubt that is true. There was no family history of schizophrenia. He spoke of the trauma of his friends dying and various effects upon him of the use of drugs by himself, and his mother’s overdose.
	
	
	Ultimately the assessment on psychometric testing of the prisoner is that he is of relatively low intelligence, at the borderline range; that is, of a range of 74 to 84 with a percentile ranking of seven, meaning that on the testing, with a 95% confidence prediction, 93% of his age cohort would score equal or ahead of him. He was attentive to the task, there was no suggestion of malingering. He had a diagnostic threshold for psychological dependence and compulsive use of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	He met the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder, particularly thought intrusion, anxiety, hyper vigilance, et cetera. His personality testing revealed a strong indication of antisocial personality problems, conduct problems, and the like. Also, with regard to the cross checking on his testing, the results indicated that he was self revealing and frank in his response.
	
	
	The psychologist opines that the prisoner had some intrusive thoughts to the point of experiencing hearing voices following the use of methylamphetamine. That is consistent with a psychotic reaction to the use of drugs. He may be suffering from a developmental disability, or an acquired brain injury. He needs more testing for that to be assessed properly. He is a compulsive user or prohibited drugs. Given the severity of his dependence personality he has an unsurprising history of symptoms consistent with the effects of trauma.
	
	
	The psychologist said, amongst other things, that he was most likely suffering from a mental illness currently, that is at the time of testing, namely PTSD, depression and anxiety, and had a propensity for brief psychotic episodes as a result of severe personality pathology and chronic ‘ice’ use.
	
	
	I could not discount the fact that his bizarre behaviour on this night was consistent with one of these brief psychotic episodes, but there is no evidence of any auditory or visual hallucinations at the time. He is keen to undertake rehabilitation and he certainly needs plenty of professional assistance when released to the community.
	
	
	As I said, I have taken into account the evidence he has given; I have already referred to it, and I also accept the evidence of his sister, both as to the incident on the early morning of 22 January and other matters. She noted that when he was released from the Richmond facility and spent two weeks with her before being refused bail in August he was calm, he was attentive and much changed. This reflects the benefits to him of the rehabilitation programs, despite the fact he left them, the non-use of drugs and the change in his attitude, as he has expressed in his comments to the Corrective Services Officer and the psychologist.
	
	
	His learned counsel in his submissions said the violence spoke for itself and regrettably that is true. It is a serious offence. Courts and the community cannot tolerate innocent citizens being struck by people affected by drugs and alcohol, for no reason. We cannot tolerate, of course, people being stabbed out of motives of jealously and out of rage and the like. But it is particularly abhorrent for the community to consider a person like Mr Lotherington going about his business and totally unexpectedly being assaulted in the manner in which he was. Clearly that is acknowledged by what his counsel said.
	
	
	His counsel referred to the psychological report and his troubled background and presentation which I have taken into account. The character of the conduct that I am concerned with, the need for drug and alcohol rehabilitation and also professional assistance which I have taken into account. His counsel submitted, and I accept, that the prisoner is entitled to the consideration of the exercise of the discretion I have to make a finding of ‘special circumstances’ pursuant to s 44 “Sentencing Procedure” Act. In my view, there should be a substantial period of supervision to assist the prisoner to adjust to community living and to receive direction and assistance n elation to anger management and the psychological issues that are identified, as well as drug and alcohol counselling.
	
	
	With regard to the finding of special circumstances, I do not propose to fix any conditions for his parole, that will be a matter for the Parole Authority, taking into account, I hope, my remarks on sentence.
	
	
	With regard to the learned Crown’s submissions, he submitted that the use of the weapon was an aggravating factor and, clearly that is so. But it is to be borne in mind, of course, that the offence, itself - wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm - inherently, one might have thought, involves a course of conduct that would involve, usually, the use of a weapon. I can imagine such a crime could be committed by the use of fists, but usually these crimes, in my experience, involve weapons.
	
	
	I believe, ultimately, that aggravating factor is very much melded into the objective facts as I have found them, and, reflected, of course, by the maximum penalty and the standard non parole period. The Crown conceded that the accused had expressed remorse and it was open to the court to determine the accused was relevantly remorseful and that there should be a discount, as I have indicated.
	
	
	With regard to his prospects of rehabilitation, the Crown, properly, put that the court might approach that aspect with some circumspection. There is a high risk of re-offending and I accept that, that is reflected in the presentence report and the psychological report. The Crown also pointed to the failure of the prisoner to complete his rehabilitation.
	
	
	I made some comments as to this matter in the course of those submissions and I need not reiterate them in detail, but I thought, in my assessment of the prisoner’s evidence, that he showed considerable insight as to the reasons he was discharged from those programs and certainly I accept that he did not leave those programs because of a lack of interest in pursuing his rehabilitation.
	
	
	Ultimately it is the case that I could not conclude that he does not have prospects of rehabilitation. I have to bear in mind, as his counsel pointed out, his youth. He is relatively young, and as this is the first significant term of imprisonment. In fact, the first term of imprisonment imposed upon him.
	
	
	In sentencing him, pursuant to s 3A of the Act, I am required to take into account the purposes of sentencing. There is, of course, an element of general deterrence required in this matter and personal deterrence. There is some element of protecting the community from the prisoner; it is quite clear that if he can behave this way after the ingestion of drugs and alcohol on one occasion, he might find himself, when affected by alcohol and drugs, behaving in a similarly bizarre and aggressive fashion.
	
	
	I have to make him accountable for his actions, denounce his conduct, recognise, certainly, the harm done to the victim and the community. I must ensure he is adequately punished but I am also required to promote his rehabilitation.
	
	
	It was a fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal on a number of occasions has reflected upon the need to recognise the purpose of sentencing includes the desirability of reforming offenders so that they will not come back before the court, not only to enhance the situation of the offender but as a mechanism for protecting the community and enhancing the community’s well being.
	
	
	In R v Blackman & Walters [2001] NSWCCA 212, Wood J, then the Chief Judge at Common Law, in his judgment adopted what had been said by King CJ in the South Australian case of Yardley v Betts ((1979) 22 SASR 108 at 112-3):
	


“The protection of the community is also contributed to by the successful rehabilitation of offenders. This aspect of sentencing should never be lost sight of and it assumes particular importance in the case of first offenders and others who have not developed settled criminal habits. If a sentence had the effect of turning an offender towards a criminal way of life, the protection of the community is, to that extent, impaired. If a sentence induces or assists an order(sic) to avoid offending in future, the protection of the community is, to that extent, enhanced. To say that the criminal law exists for the protection of the community is not to say that severity is to be regarded as the sentencing norm.”


	
	With regard to the issue of general deterrence, personal deterrence and the like, I have had regard to the psychological evidence and considering matters that were summarised by McClellan CJ in the decision of De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194. In that judgment, his Honour at [177] - [178] summarised a range of authorities going back over 20 years concerning the sentencing of an offender with a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems.
	
	
	Whilst I accept the psychological report’s findings as far as it goes, there is no contemporaneous evidence or any reference to the fact that the prisoner was being treated for a mental disability or a mental illness at the time of the commission of the offence.
	
	
	What I do accept from the evidence is that the prisoner’s mental state, disinhibited by alcohol and methylamphetamine, is a consequence in some respects, as one of the psychologists pointed out, to a background of anxiety, instability, trauma, which has led to the prisoner becoming dependant upon drugs and alcohol. In part to self-medicate symptoms that he has endured for a number of years.
	
	
	Thus, while his mental health does not directly contribute to the commission of the offence it indirectly does so, in the way it has contributed to his dependence upon alcohol and drugs. To that extent - to a limited extent, of course, his moral culpability is reduced. But, of course, the courts have said for time immemorial that drunken people cannot hide behind their drunkenness unless it gives rise to a defence to excuse themselves from serious conduct, particularly street violence. The community is sick and tired of reading and hearing about people being assaulted or attacked for no reason under no provocation in the street by people who are affected by drugs and alcohol.
	
	
	I have also factored this in to the assessment of the issue of general deterrence; it has a mild impact on that, although general deterrence is, of course, very much integral to the sentencing exercise of a crime of this character. As to his circumstances in custody, there is no suggestion that his mental condition contributes to any onerous conditions, but I have borne in mind, with little information, that he is on protection.
	
	
	I do not believe the prisoner’s condition, as best it can be identified on the evidence, presents a danger to the community. No greater weight need to be put on that matter, as discussed by Gleeson CJ in the decision of Engert from 1995. Of course, as McClellan CJ at CL pointed out, mental health problems of an offender may not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they would be relevant to the sentencing process. I have taken that into account.
	
	
	With regard to s 21A, I have already dealt with what I understand to be the relevant matters raised by the parties. I have already made the comment - not directly - that with aggravating factors, they are all matters of degree. Not all particular aggravating factors have the same effect upon the sentencing process and within a particular aggravating factor there will always be levels of aggravation. I think the facts in this case speak for themselves, without necessarily having to resort to s 21A(2) of the Act.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors I find the offence was not part of planned or part of organised criminal activity. I cannot make findings in relation to his character or the likelihood of re-offending in light of what the experts say and what the facts point to, but I do believe he does have good prospects of rehabilitation with the appropriate assistance. I conclude, also, that he is entitled to a finding on balance that he is remorseful as a mitigating factor. His plea of guilty, of course, is a mitigating factor but that is represented, too, by the discount for the plea of guilty.
	
	
	Ultimately the truth of the matter is, by reference to a consideration of a maximum penalty, which is significant, that a term of imprisonment of substance must be imposed. The last matter I must speak to very briefly is the issue of a standard non-parole period. This is an offence that carries a standard non-parole period of seven years and I have taken that into account. It is accepted in the submissions before me, on my prompting, I must say, that this must be regarded in all the circumstances as an offence within the middle range.
	
	
	That having been said, I am required to have regard to what was said about the role of the standard non-parole period in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120, but particularly now the legislative amendments subsequently which reflect what was said by the High Court in Muldrock and s 54A(2) and s 54B(2). The standard non-parole period represents the non parole period for an offence of middle range of objective seriousness in the Table of the Division only taking into account the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	Of course, in the decision of Way from 2004, the then Chief Justice said in passing that the middle range of objective seriousness was “not necessarily a narrow band”. Section 54B(2) provides that it was a matter to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence. Of course, that includes findings in relation to special circumstances.
	
	
	In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty you are convicted. The starting point of the sentence was seven years, as I said I have given you a discount of 25%. You are sentenced to a term--
	
	
	WALSH: Your Honour, if I might interrupt--
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Now, we’ve got to deal with a starting date, yes, of course. Sit down, Mr Peters.
	
	
	WALSH: It’s agreed that there is a period of eight months and 19 days spent in rehabilitation centres.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Well, I’m prepared in the context of judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal saying that a discount of up to 50% - I know there’s a judgment of Justice Fullerton, actually, that says perhaps up to 75%, although I don’t have--
	
	
	WALSH: I think the - wouldn’t quibble with the 50%.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Well, I was prepared to give him a benefit of four months on that.
	
	
	WALSH: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Which is not quite 50%.
	
	
	WALSH: I accept that, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Do you have a problem with that, Mr Crown?
	
	
	CLAYTON: I’ll just note that on a number of occasions he was removed from-
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, I understand, I note that--
	
	
	CLAYTON: No, no, I’ll just note those.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: It’s a bit like - how about this problem: I hear what you say but let’s assume he spent six months in custody presentence and then he escaped from lawful custody and then they had to arrest him and they put him back in custody, I would still have to take into account the six months he spent in custody before he escaped, even though, owing for the fact, that he gave himself a bond, so to speak.
	
	
	CLAYTON: Yes, I understand, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: It’s the fact of the time in the residential facility that is the critical issue, it’s not a comment upon his conduct.
	
	
	CLAYTON: Yes, I don’t wish to be heard further, I just wanted to raise that.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You have been put on the spot, but then again, it wasn’t a matter that crossed my mind yesterday and it really only came to my mind as I was reflecting upon the evidence in front of me.
	
	
	CLAYTON: No, I appreciate that, your Honour, my learned friend - Ms Haywood certainly assisted me in the calculations.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: But you accept the figures that have been provided?
	
	
	CLAYTON: Yes, and I’ve managed to find the information I can and Ms Haywood has provided the remainder.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: It accords. So, I’ll bear in mind that it’s said that he spent eight months and 17 days in residential facilities, I’ll give him a credit of four months for that.
	
	
	CLAYTON: Thank you.
	
	
	WALSH: Thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, thank you for reminding me. I would have corrected the orders anyway. Subject to discussion. I am sorry, stand-up, Mr Peters.
	
	
	You are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non parole period of two years, seven months. I am going to have to do a recalculation: that term of imprisonment will commence on 5 December 2014 and it will expire on 4 July 2017, on which date you will be eligible for release to parole. The balance of the sentence will still be two years and eight months but that will expire on 3 March 2020. It will be a matter for the Parole Authority whether you are released to parole on that date. Just take a seat.
	
	
	Have I got those dates right: 5 December 2014 as the commencement date?
	
	
	WALSH: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: 4 July 2017 for the non-parole period?
	
	
	WALSH: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Right, thank you.
	
	
	WALSH: Just one final matter, if I might?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, Mr Walsh?
	
	
	WALSH: I know in the course of your remarks on sentence you referred to this but I’d ask you to make formal orders that he receive, whilst in custody, alcohol and drug treatment and counselling and also psychiatric and/or psychological assessment.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I hear what you say; I am happy to have it marked that I recommend that he receive drug and alcohol counselling and appropriate medical and psychological treatment.
	
	
	WALSH: Yes?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I have got no power to order it.
	
	
	WALSH: No, I understand that.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: So, I can recommend that, I cannot tell Corrective Services what to do. They’ll be very pleased to know that I can’t do that.
	
	
	WALSH: No, we appreciate that.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: But, the truth is I am happy to recommend it. I imagine it would happen in the normal course of events anyway, but it’s very much in your client’s court too, don’t forget. I mean, he’s got to seek out some of these things.
	
	
	WALSH: Of course.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Right, thank you, gentlemen, sorry to keep you. Thank you, Mr Peters, you’re excused. My associate’s asking me about whether there’s any provision in the relevant Act about the issue of residential care, but it’s not in the Act.
	
	
	WALSH: No.

		18 January 2016",2015-10-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2426323,R v Chung [2015] NSWDC 360,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing a man who is an otherwise good man. He is highly regarded in his church and has good relationships with his family. But he has committed an extraordinarily serious crime. The man’s name is Tae Yong Chung. The crime he has committed is aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence. The aggravation is that when he broke and entered he knew someone was at home.
	
	
	That is a crime under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Parliament regards it as a very serious crime. Parliament regards it as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to the crime. Not only that, it has fixed a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	First, I need to say what happened to bring about this crime and I also need to make an assessment of how serious an example Mr Chung’s offence is of this particular crime.
	
	
	Iven Han was at home on the computer on 16 September 2012. His teenage stepchildren were upstairs in their rooms. One was 14 and the other was 18. The front door was closed but not locked. Iven Han heard the door bell and saw a man walking in. He did not know the man. The man asked him “Are you James?” And Mr Han said “No.” They were standing facing each other. Then what Mr Chung did was to kick Mr Han in the stomach. The blow pushed him backwards and he found that he could not breathe because of the pain. Not content with that, Mr Chung climbed on top of Mr Han and started to hit him on his face with his fists many times. Then, worse still, Mr Chung took out a knife. (I will return to explain why I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Chung produced a knife.) They continued to struggle inside. Mr Han was obviously very concerned for his life. The blade of the knife was about ten centimetres long. Mr Han said that he grabbed the knife and that he “thought that I was going to die if I am being stabbed by a knife” (at T22). What Mr Han grabbed was the wrist of the hand which had the knife. While he was doing that to try to preserve his life, Mr Chung “continuously assaulted me on my face.” He called out to his stepchildren upstairs to call the police.
	
	
	Fortunately for Mr Han, Mr Chung backed off. He walked backwards away from Mr Han and outside onto a verandah. Mr Han was concerned for the safety of his children so he took a golf club and went out onto the verandah where the men continued to struggle, assaulting one another and causing a good deal of bloodshed.
	
	
	Mr Han had the option of closing the front door after Mr Chung left and locking it. He did not need to pursue him to the front verandah. I am not at all criticising him for what appears to be an act of bravery to protect his stepchildren but I will not take into account against Mr Chung what happened on the verandah because Mr Chung had already stopped his attack. That is a brief description of how serious this crime was that Mr Chung committed.
	
	
	I said I would return to the question of the knife. At this stage, I should explain that Mr Chung was arrested and charged with the crime. He pleaded not guilty and his case came on before me in Parramatta earlier this year. The trial was before a jury and the jury found him guilty of the crime. Mr T Jones of counsel appeared as the Crown Prosecutor and Mr G Wendler of counsel appeared for Mr Chung. In conducting his client’s case, Mr Wendler put to Mr Han that it was Mr Han who produced the knife not Mr Chung. His client also gave evidence to that effect. Mr Wendler argued in the sentence proceedings before me that I should not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was his client who produced the knife. He argued that common sense indicates that Mr Han would have alerted his children in calling out for help. Mr Wendler pointed out that neither of his stepchildren saw the knife or mentioned it when they phoned the emergency services.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was Mr Chung who produced the knife and that there is no reasonable possibility that it was Mr Han who produced the knife. My reasons are these. First it was an issue in the trial who produced the knife. Mr Han said “Mr Chung did.” Mr Chung said “Mr Han did.” The jury’s verdict was consistent with the jury accepting beyond reasonable doubt the essential elements of the crime that Mr Chung was charged with. That does not necessarily mean that they made a determination about the presence of the knife - that is for me to decide - but nevertheless, I take into account the jury’s verdict. Secondly, Mr Wendler is right about neither stepchild mentioning the knife. But on re-reading the transcript of their evidence I notice that the stepdaughter although she saw them struggling on the floor she “couldn’t see it properly, because of the sofa blocking my view.” The stepson came out from his bedroom and saw them struggling but then left to make the triple-0 call. He made that call from his bedroom and after that he went outside because the police cars were there. Thirdly, Mr Han’s then wife had never seen the knife before. She was very clear that it was not her husband’s knife when it was put to her by Mr Wendler nor had Mr Han’s stepson ever seen the knife before and when asked whether it was Mr Han’s knife he said “No, definitely not” (at T168). Next, the stepson was asked by the Crown Prosecutor (at T161) what Mr Han had told the police. (The stepson had acted as an interpreter.) What the stepson recalled his stepfather telling the police was that “a complete stranger rang the bell and came in and started threatening with a knife.” Finally, conversation was overhead at the scene when Mr Chung was heard saying that he would “definitely kill this guy.” Mr Wendler cross-examined one of the persons who heard that about the meaning of the expression in Korean and (at T105) she said that it was “not really common” as an expression “because it is something that you use when you really hate someone, that you wanted to kill someone.” She acknowledged that expression is one that a person “would use when someone is really angry.”
	
	
	For those reasons I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that when Mr Chung came into Mr Han’s home uninvited and attacked him he was carrying a knife.
	
	
	As I said, I need to make some assessment of how serious an example this offence is of the crime created by Parliament. As Mr Wendler said, the section covers a wide range of offending “from the titular to conduct of significant seriousness.” (I am quoting from Mr Wendler’s written submissions which became MFI 16.)
	
	
	Whilst I remember, if I have not formally done so, I convict Mr Chung of the offence.
	
	
	Mr Jones, in his written submissions and in oral submissions before me last week on 8 October 2015, pointed to factors which are “aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence.” I am referring to s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). One aggravating factor that is present in this case is that Mr Chung was armed with a weapon. I regard that as very serious, particularly since it was a knife which had the potential to cause serious or fatal injury. Another aggravating factor is that the crime involved a physical attack - what s 21A describes as actual use of violence.
	
	
	Some crimes of break and enter and commit serious indictable offence are far less serious than this. I sentenced a young man yesterday for breaking and entering a home where nobody was there and stealing some money from a jar and some cash that was lying around. In this case Mr Chung broke into his victim’s home armed with a knife and attacked the householder. That is a further aggravating factor that the offence was committed in the home of Mr Han. Persons are entitled to feel safe and secure in their own homes.
	
	
	Mr Wendler pointed to the unusual factor that Mr Chung had rung the doorbell first. I do not put a lot of weight on that as a mitigating factor. The crime started after he rang the doorbell and as soon as he broke in uninvited.
	
	
	It emerged in evidence that the motive for the crime was what one of the counsel described as misplaced altruism. Mr Chung said that a friend of his had been defrauded of a lot of money by a man who used to live in Mr Han’s household (the man was an in-law or brother). He went to the household - having apparently followed Mr Han’s wife - to find the man and seek his own justice for his friend. To describe it as misplaced altruism does not emphasise the seriousness of the action taken by Mr Chung on that day.
	
	
	Mr Jones argued that the objective seriousness of this crime is at or above the mid-range of objective seriousness. I accept that it is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	In a moment I will say something about Mr Chung’s personal life because, as I said in introducing the sentence, it will show that he is an otherwise good man who has contributed to the community and his family. But what has become clear to me in considering this sentence is just how serious the crime is that Mr Chung has committed.
	
	
	I should add that one of the further aggravating features which I omitted to mention was that the crime was committed in the presence of a child. By that I am referring to the 14 year old stepson of Mr Han. So what Mr Chung has done is to break into a man’s own home, armed with a knife and physically attacked him and this was witnessed by the man’s own stepchildren.
	
	
	I described Mr Chung as a good man. There is one qualification. He has one item on a criminal record. It is for an assault committed in 1991. It was obviously not regarded as serious in the Local Court, where it was dealt with, because Mr Chung received the equivalent of a good behaviour bond and no conviction was entered. He gets the benefit of a finding by me that he is a man of good character.
	
	
	That finding is confirmed by exhibit S1, a letter from a Pastor of the Perth Immanuel Church, who knows Mr Chung well. In fact, he has known him for 30 years. Mr Kim knows all about the offending behaviour. Mr Kim says that the behaviour “is truly and totally out of my friend’s previous good character”. He described it as “truly a one-off incident which will not happen again”. I do regard it as a one-off incident. I do accept that he is a man of good character. I do accept that it is unlikely to happen again. The difficulty is that I keep coming back to how serious this crime is, objectively speaking.
	
	
	Mr Wendler called his client to give evidence on the sentence proceedings. He is now 62 and lives in Campsie. He has had a good relationship with his de facto partner for over ten years. He has always had good employment. He is a welder, presently working on the Bangaroo site, bringing in $1,200 - $1,300 a week. Mr Chung is an Australian citizen, having come here in 1976 and has family in Sydney. He has some health issues. He has high blood pressure and some gout and has been treated for a cataract and glaucoma. His de facto partner studies rather than works and she is an artist. She is dependent financially on Mr Chung. He pays the rent. She is, as he said, totally dependent on him for financial support.
	
	
	There is a pre-sentence report prepared by an officer of Community Corrections with Corrective Services. It reminds me that Mr Chung has a son who is married and he has grandchildren. The author described Mr Chung as “gainfully employed, and appears to be following pro-social pursuits, he appears to be regretful about his offending behaviour”.
	
	
	I accept that he is contrite. I accept that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. Mr Chung, I should say, does not get the benefit of pleading guilty. That in no way increases the sentence. He simply exercised his right to plead not guilty. However, it does mean that a discount available to someone who pleads guilty is not available to him. He has not spent any time in custody since his arrest.
	
	
	Mr Wendler, in putting submissions on behalf of his client, suggested that a prison sentence could be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order. Of course, I must approach that submission by first determining whether there needs to be a sentence of imprisonment and if so, for how long. This is a case where there is no alternative but to send the offender to fulltime gaol and the prison sentence must be longer than a sentence which would be appropriate for an Intensive Correction Order.
	
	
	Given the seriousness of this crime and the fact that it lies within the middle of the range of objective seriousness, but taking into account Mr Chung’s factors favourable to him, which I have referred to - including, I might add, the fact that he was on bail with restrictive conditions, including reporting, for some time, because his case was not reached twice - I regard an appropriate sentence as being one of six years imprisonment. Normally for a sentence of six years imprisonment the non-parole envisaged by the sentencing legislation would be four and a half years imprisonment. However, I think there are special circumstances for reducing this and I will reduce the non-parole period to three and a half years imprisonment. I have in mind his age and his health serving the time in prison will be harder for him in those circumstances.
	
	
	I should add that apart from it being part of his personal circumstances I cannot mitigate the sentence because of the difficulty he will leave his partner in by not being able to financially support her. The higher courts have made the law very clear on this for some years. Difficulty caused to friends and family members by offenders is not to be regarded as mitigating a sentence unless there are some extraordinary circumstances. Withdrawal of financial benefits does not fall into that category.
	


HIS HONOUR: I am going to sentence you now, Mr Chung, if you would stand up please.


	
	Mr Chung, I set a non-parole period of three and one half years imprisonment. It commences today 16 October 2015 and will expire on 15 April 2019. The balance of the term is two and a half years. That will commence on 16 April 2019 and will expire on 15 October 2021. The first date on which you will be eligible for release is 15 April 2019.
	


HIS HONOUR:   So to make it clear, your overall sentence is six years. The non-parole period where you must stay in gaol is three and one half years. That non-parole period ends on 15 April 2019 and the Parole Authority will consider your release then. Have a seat, Mr Chung. Mr Jones, Mr Yang, tell me if there are any corrections that are to be made, any oversights or misstatements. But also the sums, so to speak, have I got the figures right? By that I mean the start and end dates and non-parole periods, to save us coming back? Go ahead and check them, it’s important that we do them.

JONES: We think your Honour’s figures are right.

HIS HONOUR: Okay, good. Mr Yang?

YANG: Yes.

JONES: Your Honour, there is just one matter. In the Crown’s sentencing bundle, your Honour, there’s a s 166 certificate, there’s a backup.

HIS HONOUR: What was that for?

JONES: There’s a backup offence. The charge is withdrawn. Would your Honour dismiss it?

HIS HONOUR: Yes.


	
	I note that a backup charge of armed with intent to commit an indictable offence is withdrawn and I dismiss that charge.
	


HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else?

JONES: Does your Honour propose to return the exhibits?

HIS HONOUR: Yes. I will direct my associate to return exhibits A to K to you, Mr Jones. And exhibit 1, the golf club, came from the Crown, but was called for and tendered by Mr Wendler. So my guess is it goes back to you. Are you okay with that, Mr Yang?

YANG: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And exhibits 2 and 3 to Mr Yang. And I will direct that they be held by the prosecution and the defence for an appropriate period of time. What would that be? In case there is an appeal.

JONES: Your Honour, I am instructed that the exhibits stay in a permanent file at the DPP and the golf club will be returned to the police and then to Mr Han. Well that may--


	
	I will simply direct that the exhibits remain in a safe place, and I am not saying where that should be, but I am applying it to both of you, until the question of any appeal is resolved. If there is no appeal of either conviction or sentence the exhibits may be returned to their respective owners. If there is an appeal of either type the exhibits must remain that place until the appeal and any subsequent proceedings are resolved.
	


HIS HONOUR: How does that sound? I think that deals with it doesn’t it?

JONES: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Anything else, Mr Jones, Mr Yang?

JONES: No.

YANG: No, your Honour.

		10 February 2016",2015-10-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2426551,Vincenzo Jon Fedele v R [2015] NSWCCA 286,"Judgment


	
	HIDDEN J: The applicant, Vincenzo Jon Fedele, pleaded guilty in the District Court to child pornography offences under Commonwealth and State law. The Commonwealth charge was using a carriage service to access child pornography, an offence under s 471.19(1) of the Criminal Code (C’th), carrying a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment. The State offence was possessing child abuse material, an offence under s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. For the State offence he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months dating from the date sentence was passed, 11 September 2015. For the Commonwealth offence he was sentenced to a concurrent term of imprisonment for 12 months, to be released after 6 months upon entering into a recognizance pursuant to s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914. He seeks leave to appeal against those sentences.
	


Facts


	
	An adequate summary of the facts found by the sentencing judge is set out in the Crown submissions, as follows:
	


(a)   The AFP executed a search warrant on the applicant’s residential premises on 11 June 2014, at a time when the applicant was present;

(b)   An ASUS laptop computer was located in the applicant’s bedroom. The applicant informed the AFP that it was his computer, which he had purchased in 2007. The applicant confirmed that the computer was password protected and that no-one other than him had access to the computer;

(c)   The applicant also informed the AFP that he had used a program called FrostWire to download adult pornography, music and programs;

(d)   The applicant said he had not used the computer since 2010;

(e)   A review of the computer revealed the presence of images and videos identified by AFP members as child pornography;

(f)   The computer was forensically analysed and revealed five picture files and five video files. Two of the video files were classified as “category 4” in the ANVIL scheme, which includes penetrative sexual activity between children and or children and adults. Category 2 includes non-penetrative sexual activity between children or solo masturbation by a child, and category 3 includes non-penetrative sexual activity between children and adults;

(g)   Two files had been accessed on 23 June 2011 and two accessed on 10 February 2012;

(h)   Forensic analysis of the computer showed that on 23 June 2011 the applicant had used search terms “preteen” and “Preteen Models”, when one of the images classified as child pornography was accessed. The following websites were also accessed:

      i.   TOP Preteen No Nude Models/PRETEEN MODELS

      ii.   PRETEEN MODELS

      iii.   Sylvia Preteen Model

      iv.   Sylvia Preteen Model 1 Preteen Models

      v.   PRETEEN MODELS Atom Feed

vi.   PRETEEN MODELS Young and Sweet Cuties Comments Feed

(i)   FrostWire is a peer to peer file sharing program used to directly share files between computers. FrostWire was used to obtain one image file and the five video files;

(j)   Of the five video files, 2 were category 2, 1 was category 3 and the remaining 2 were category 4 of the ANVIL scheme.

(k)   Analysis of the computer also revealed that the applicant had entered the search term “preteen” (26 times) and “pthc” (3 times) into Google search engine using Internet Explorer. “Pthc” stands for “preteen hard core”;

(l)   There were also a further 49 “thumbnail” files located on the computer which were classified as child pornography. The thumbnail files were consistent with picture files that had been previewed or opened using the Windows operating system;

(m)   The access and possession of the material was for the applicant’s personal purposes only (that is, not for re-distribution or any commercial purpose).


	
	Although it is not specified in the statement of facts which was before his Honour, it appears that access occurred on five occasions between June 2011 and July 2012 and a sixth occasion in March 2014. The possession charge related to six of the files the subject of the access charge. The occasions on which the applicant entered certain search terms, referred to in (k) above, and the thumbnail files referred to in (l) are not the subject of either charge, but are properly to be taken into account.
	


Subjective case


	
	The applicant was aged between 19 and 22 over the period of the offending. He is now 23. Apart from a driving offence, of no significance for present purposes, he has no criminal history. Before the sentencing judge were reports of a psychologist, Mr Patrick Sheehan, a pre-sentence report, a number of favourable references, including one from his fiancée, and a statement by the applicant himself. This material made out what his Honour described as a “very strong” subjective case.
	
	
	The applicant had a stable upbringing and a good relationship with his parents and siblings who, despite being shocked by his offending behaviour, remained supportive of him. He was educated to HSC standard and completed one semester of a university degree. He had been working in his family’s fish wholesale business and, to some extent, as a professional musician. He had been in a relationship with his fiancée for almost four years and, although deeply distressed at his offences, she also was supportive of him.
	
	
	The applicant’s offending behaviour began in 2011 during a difficult period of his life. In her reference his fiancée revealed that at that early stage of their relationship she discovered that she had stage 3 HPV, which was on the verge of becoming cervical cancer if not treated, and that the applicant shouldered the burden of her care. She described this as a “very costly, exhausting and difficult time in both our lives.” He took her to medical consultations, helped her financially, and supported her emotionally.
	
	
	In a report of 11 May 2015 the psychologist, Mr Sheehan, recorded the applicant’s account that the period leading to the onset of the offences in 2011 was an unhappy time. He described difficulties in his relationship, in his work, in his pursuit of his university course and contact with his school friends. He said that he was looking at online pornography frequently and that his sexual interests were becoming “diverse, including themes of lesbianism and group sex.” He added that most of his online pornography use was “mainstream adult material”, and was not able to explain what purpose the child sexual material served for him. He denied that he found those pornographic images sexually arousing or that he had “any intent or interest in actual sexual contact with children.”
	
	
	He had more to say about his motivation to the author of the pre-sentence report, Ms Jodie McMahon, whose report is dated 30 July 2015. To her he also described the difficult period of his life leading up to his involvement in the offences. He said that his possession of child pornographic material was not for sexual gratification but, rather, for his “guilty pleasure seeing people in shittier positions than me.” He stated that it “made him feel better witnessing people suffer or he would treat people poorly to make them feel bad.” He added that he was “not proud of the person he was at that time.”
	
	
	In his statement to the court he wrote:
	


“… my actions in the past were completely selfish and reckless. I was a very bitter and angry teenager. Over the years I had done only things to benefit myself. I used other people’s misfortune to help me feel better. If I was feeling really down, or depressed and even hopeless; I would watch this type of material, amongst with all the other different types of pornography, to make me feel better.”

He went on to express his remorse, adding that “I do not want to be that person.” 


	
	In July 2012, his fiancée returned to her country of origin, Canada. He joined her there in September of that year, and lived with her and her parents for over a year before the two of them returned to Australia, as he put it in his statement, “to start a new life together.” He acknowledged having accessed the offending material on one occasion in 2014, after their return, but said that he did so because he was curious to see if Frostwire still worked and “stopped very quickly” because he knew that “this was not what I wanted to do ever again.” This was the sixth occasion of access referred to above.
	
	
	The effect of the references, including that of his fiancée, was that the applicant was an honest, respected, dependable and kind person, and that the offences were entirely out of character. His remorse for his offending behaviour emerges in this material and in the reports. Mr Sheehan observed that during his interview with him he “spoke with obvious discomfort and shame about his offences”. In the pre-sentence report Ms McMahon recorded that he “appears to accept responsibility for his actions and expressed an understanding of the seriousness of the offences”, and that he “was aware of the impact of his offending on the victims of pornography and the wider community.”  
	
	
	In his statement the applicant wrote:
	


“I am sorry that I have accessed and downloaded child pornography. I am well aware that in accessing and as a downloader of this material, that I have encouraged the notion that there is a place for child pornography and child abuse in this world and for this I am ashamed and sorry. I do not want to be part of that. I don’t … want to be part of abuse on children. I am also truly sorry for the suffering that I have caused to my fiancée … , my family and my friends.”


	
	Mr Sheehan, well-known and respected in the area of forensic psychology, considered the danger of the applicant re-offending by reference to static and dynamic risk factors and concluded that he “has almost none of the characteristics associated with re-offending as identified in the literature.” In expressing his opinion at the conclusion of his first report, Mr Sheehan wrote:
	


“Mr Fedele has very few of the features commonly associated with this type of offences. There are none of the background factors of social inadequacy, feelings of sexual intimidation towards adult partners fuelling emotional/sexual identification with less threatening targets such as children, or disproportionate overuse of the internet, that are in my experience, all common precursors to the emergence of accessing child abuse material online. Mr Fedele has described a period of despondency, boredom, aimlessness and absence of fulfilment in the period preceding the onset of the offences, as well as evolving themes of sexual interest. These may be significant background factors contributing towards his decision to seek access to child abuse material. He has work to do in terms of overcoming his evident shame and discomfort to provide a useful account of his own behaviour. These insights can be targeted in psychological treatment.”


	
	In a supplementary report Mr Sheehan recorded that the applicant had attended 8 treatment sessions between May and July 2015. It is sufficient to say that he concluded that the applicant had “participated well in the treatment process, particularly given that he had only 8 sessions to cover a broad range of difficult issues.” Mr Sheehan continued:
	


“He has made a positive start to his treatment journey, and would appear to have a solid grasp on the range of behaviours that have contributed as background factors to the index offences. In my expert opinion, all evidence suggests that Mr Fedele’s risk of re-offending is low.”


	
	In the pre-sentence report Ms McMahon noted the applicant’s progress in therapy, and observed that he “appears to have a strong support system within the community that will continue to encourage him to address his offending behaviour in an effort to adapt to a lawful community lifestyle.” She considered that he would benefit from a period of supervision and assessed him as suitable for a community service order.
	


Remarks on sentence


	
	As I have said, his Honour acknowledged the applicant’s strong subjective case. He accepted that he was remorseful, that he had good prospects of rehabilitation and that he was unlikely to re-offend in this way. The applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court, and his Honour allowed a 25% reduction of sentence for the State offence in recognition of the utilitarian value of the plea, and a 20% reduction for the Commonwealth offence for his willingness to facilitate the administration of justice.
	
	
	Nevertheless, his Honour did not find in the subjective material, including the psychiatric reports, any adequate explanation of the applicant’s conduct or any amelioration of the gravity of it. Having regard to the nature of the conduct and the limited quantity of material involved, he assessed the Commonwealth offence as between the low end and mid-range of objective gravity, and reached the same conclusion in relation to the State offence. His Honour also recognised “some commonality” between the offences, reflected in the imposition of concurrent sentences.
	
	
	That said, his Honour referred to the prevalence of offences of this kind, the difficulty in detecting them, and the importance of general deterrence. As to the State offence, he noted the video files in category 4 showing penetrative sexual activity between an adult and a child, which he described as “completely disturbing” and “quite sickening.” He also noted that the applicant had not been entirely frank in his admissions to police in that he claimed at that stage that he had not used his computer since 2010.
	
	
	As to the applicant’s stated reason for his involvement in the offences, his Honour was unable to arrive at any conclusion about the assertion that he derived no sexual pleasure from the material. He accepted that the reason was that which the applicant had proffered in the pre-sentence report, but described it as “callously reprehensible.” He later said that the facts “involve a very deliberate accessing of child pornography for the proffered reason and it seems to me that the circumstances of this case are particularly reprehensible and particularly heinous.”
	
	
	In the course of submissions on sentence, senior counsel then appearing for the applicant (who did not appear in this court) submitted that his Honour should deal with him in such a way as to allow him to remain in the community. She argued that it would be “well within range” to impose suspended sentences but that “it really shouldn’t go much higher than that.” This was a reference to the power to suspend a sentence under s 12 of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), and to direct the release of a person forthwith under s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act (C’th). She submitted that an intensive correction order was not called for, given the applicant’s response to counselling. In answer to a query from his Honour, the Crown prosecutor (who also did not appear in this court) said that suspended sentences would not be considered manifestly inadequate. The Crown’s position was that custodial sentences were appropriate for offences of this kind, but the “mode” of such a sentence was a matter for his Honour.
	
	
	On this issue his Honour expressed his conclusion in his remarks as follows:
	


“I have thought long and hard about what sentences I should impose and whether I can suspend the sentences and, in my view, there is no alternative to custody. No alternatives would accommodate the purposes of sentencing in this particular case. I propose to impose a custodial sentence in each case.

I have been urged to suspend the sentence in each case and that is a matter I have pondered on for a number of weeks now. It is tempting to suspend a sentence so that a young man doesn’t have to go to gaol, but weighing all the considerations up, it seems to me that suspending a sentence wouldn’t adequately accommodate the purposes of sentencing and I don’t propose to fully suspend the sentence.” 

His Honour had earlier considered the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.


	
	It is this passage which is at the heart of the present application.
	


The application


	
	Mr Game SC, who appeared with Ms Huxley for the applicant, argued 4 grounds of the application. They are closely related and centre upon the availability of alternatives to imprisonment or, at least, terms of imprisonment to be served full time. Grounds 1 and 2 assert that his Honour failed to apply relevant statutory provisions, s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (NSW) and s 17A of the Crimes Act (C’th). Ground 3 complains that his Honour failed properly to consider alternatives to full time imprisonment and ground 4 is that, because such an alternative was not adopted, the sentences are manifestly excessive.
	


Grounds 1 & 2 – the relevant statutory provisions


	
	Section 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (“CSP Act”) provides:
	


“5   Penalties of imprisonment

(1)    A court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.

(2)   A court that sentences an offender to imprisonment for 6 months or less must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for doing so, including:

(a)   its reasons for deciding that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate, and

(b)   its reasons for deciding not to make an order allowing the offender to participate in an intervention program or other program for treatment or rehabilitation (if the offender has not previously participated in such a program in respect of the offence for which the court is sentencing the offender).

(3)   Subsection (2) does not limit any other requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(4)   A sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with this section.

(5)   Subject to sections 12 and 99, Part 4 applies to all sentences of imprisonment, including any sentence the subject of an intensive correction order or home detention order.”


	
	Section 17A of the Crimes Act (C’th) (“Crimes Act”) provides:
	


“17A   Restriction on imposing sentences

(1)   A court shall not pass a sentence of imprisonment on any person for a federal offence, or for an offence against the law of an external Territory that is prescribed for the purposes of this section, unless the court, after having considered all other available sentences, is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.

(2)   Where a court passes a sentence of imprisonment on a person for a federal offence, or for an offence against the law of an external Territory that is prescribed for the purposes of this section, the court:

(a)   shall state the reasons for its decision that no other sentence is appropriate; and

(b)   shall cause those reasons to be entered in the records of the court.

(3)   The failure of a court to comply with the provisions of this section does not invalidate any sentence.

(4)   This section applies subject to any contrary intention in the law creating the offence.”


	
	It will be seen that the two provisions are to the same effect, although subs (2) of the State provision specifically addresses sentences of 6 months or less. Both sections provide that failure to comply with their terms does not invalidate the sentence, but this does not mean that such a failure cannot give rise to appellable error. In respect of the State provision so much is spelled out in s 101A of the CSP Act. In respect of the Commonwealth offence it is established by authority: R v Engeln [2014] QCA 313 at [45] (citing the earlier decision of that court in R v Verburgt [2009] QCA 33).
	
	
	In terms of sentencing options Mr Game described the present case as “borderline”, arguing that alternatives to imprisonment – certainly to full time imprisonment – loomed large. Both the State and Commonwealth provisions required his Honour to determine whether no penalty other than imprisonment was appropriate. Here the term “imprisonment” includes a suspended sentence under s 12 of the CSP Act: R v JCE [2000] NSWCCA 498, 120 A Crim R 18, at [15] (21), R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [25]. Likewise, the power to suspend a sentence under s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act arises only once a court has determined to impose a sentence of imprisonment. Equally, an intensive correction order (“ICO”) is a means of serving a sentence of imprisonment: s 7 of the CSP Act, as is home detention: s 6. So much is also apparent from s 5(5), set out above.
	
	
	Accordingly, his Honour had to consider the availability of options other than imprisonment, such as a community service order or a good behaviour bond. Mr Game noted the submission of his predecessor in the sentence proceedings that the applicant should be allowed to remain in the community and the fact that he was said in the pre-sentence report to be suitable for community service.
	
	
	Referring to the passage from the remarks on sentence quoted at [21] above, Mr Game argued that his Honour had done no more than express his conclusion that suspended sentences were not appropriate as they would not accommodate “the purposes of sentencing in this particular case.” He was silent as to the possible alternatives to imprisonment, the consideration of which was required by the State and Federal provisions. Indeed, s 17A(2)(a) of the Crimes Act expressly directed him to state the reasons for his decision that no sentence other than imprisonment was appropriate.
	
	
	Moreover, Mr Game argued, in sentencing the applicant to imprisonment for 6 months for the State offence, his Honour failed to meet the requirement set by s 5(2) of the CSP Act, that is, to give reasons for deciding that no other penalty was appropriate and for not making an order allowing the applicant “to participate in an intervention program or other program for treatment or rehabilitation … .”
	
	
	In response, the Crown prosecutor in this Court submitted that in his remarks, read as a whole, his Honour had given adequate reasons for determining that there must be a term of imprisonment and for ruling out alternatives to that course. He noted his Honour’s observations, referred to above, about the gravity of the offences and the need for general deterrence.
	
	
	He cited the Western Australian decision of Warnakulasuriya v The Queen [2009] WASC 257, an appeal from a wholly suspended sentence of 3 months passed upon three men for a charge of escaping from an immigration detention centre, an offence under the Migration Act 1958 (C’th). Before the magistrate the appellants had sought a discharge without conviction under s 19B of the Crimes Act. The magistrate refused to do so, referring to the need for a deterrent sentence and finding that the prerequisites for discharge under s 19B were not established. One of the grounds of appeal was that the magistrate had failed to comply with s 17A of the Crimes Act by not considering other alternatives to imprisonment. Hall J held that his Honour’s remarks on sentence sufficiently identified his reasons for imposing a term of imprisonment. His Honour said at [33]:
	


“… s 17A(2) requires that reasons be stated for a decision that no other sentence but one of imprisonment is appropriate but does not stipulate the content of those reasons nor does it specifically require that the magistrate run through a checklist of possibilities and state why each of them is not appropriate in the circumstances of the case. The reasons of the magistrate have to be examined in their totality and provided that, when so examined, they adequately explain why no other sentence but one of imprisonment is considered appropriate s 17A(2) is satisfied.”


	
	Hall J referred at [34] to a Tasmanian decision to the same effect in Dadson v O’Brien [1998] TASSC 75, in which Wright J said:
	


“It may be observed at the outset that s 17A(2)(a) does not specifically require the sentencing court to isolate such reasons from other considerations which it has taken into account or to compendiously list those factors as distinct from other factors which have moved the court to take the course of imprisoning the offender. In short, s 17A does not require the court to give separate and distinct reasons for concluding that a sentence of imprisonment is the only appropriate response to the offence being considered, if, in the course of discussing factors relevant to the question of sentence generally, the judicial officer indicates those features which he regards as significantly enhancing the criminality of the offence or the culpability of the offender.

...

In my opinion, it would be a rare case in which s 17A will afford a basis for impugning a sentence where it is plain that the sentencing judge or magistrate has taken account of all relevant matters and has justifiably concluded that either a suspended or immediate custodial sentence is required.”


	
	Having referred to this Tasmanian decision, Hall J continued at [35]:
	


“I agree with the views expressed by Wright J and, accordingly, it cannot be said that merely because the learned magistrate did not specifically refer to options other than a s 19B order or imprisonment that there was failure to provide the reasons required by s 17A(2). In my view, it is clear from the learned magistrate's reasons that he considered that a sentence of imprisonment was the only appropriate disposition in the circumstances of this case. It is evident that he was conscious that other possibilities were open when dealing with offences of this type but did not consider them appropriate in the particular circumstances of this case.” 


	
	This was also the approach of the Queensland Court of Appeal in R v Engeln (supra). In that case leave to appeal was sought against full time custodial sentences for a number of offences under s 474 of the Criminal Code of using a carriage service. Here also, a ground of the application was the asserted failure of the sentencing judge to comply with s 17A of the Crimes Act. Henry J, with whom Fraser JA and Mullins J agreed, referred at [46] to the relevant part of the sentencing judge’s reasons. After summarising the nature of the applicant’s offences and referring to the importance of deterrence, the judge said that he had had regard “to the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act (C’th)”, and expressed the view that “sentences of imprisonment are the only appropriate sentences to be imposed.” Henry J continued at [47]:
	


“It is a formidable obstacle to this ground of appeal that the sentencing judge indicated his satisfaction that sentences of imprisonment were the only appropriate sentences. His Honour did not articulate the nature of the other sentences available under the Commonwealth sentencing regime. However, his decision that sentences of imprisonment were ‘the only appropriate sentences’ necessarily means he considered that no other sentences, vis those not involving a sentence of imprisonment, would have been appropriate.”


	
	The Crown prosecutor submitted that the approach articulated in these decisions should be applied in the present case. When his Honour said in the passage in his remarks quoted at [21] above that no alternatives would accommodate the purposes of sentencing, he should be taken, in respect of both the State and Commonwealth offences, to have decided that only imprisonment was appropriate and to have ruled out any possible alternative. Accordingly, the requirement of both s 5(1) of the CSP Act and s 17A(1) of the Crimes Act had been met.
	
	
	As to s 5(2) of the CSP Act, the Crown prosecutor argued that his Honour had seen the Commonwealth offence as the more serious of the two and determined and it must attract a full time custodial sentence. As a result, having ruled out alternatives to imprisonment, his remaining sentencing options for the State offence were limited. Because of the custodial component of the sentence for the Commonwealth offence he could not have imposed a suspended sentence and the applicant could not have been assessed as suitable for an ICO or home detention. The Crown prosecutor also noted that the 6 month sentence for the State offence was wholly concurrent with the sentence for the Commonwealth offence, so as not to extend beyond the custodial component of that sentence. Thus, he argued, the sentence for the State offence was the most lenient outcome available.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor argued that any breach by his Honour of s 5 was no more than technical, and not such as to merit intervention by this Court. He cited, by way of analogy, Kanengele-Yondgo v R [2006] NSWCCA 354 at [37] – [40]. In that case the sentencing judge had passed a sentence without a non-parole period but did not give reasons for declining to set a non-parole period, as required by s 45(2) of the CSP Act. However, the judge had accumulated upon that sentence a sentence with a non-parole period in respect of a second offence. It was apparent that, as is commonly the case, his Honour had done so as to achieve an aggregate sentence with an effective non-parole period marking the criminality of the two offences. It was in those circumstances that Hislop J, delivering the leading judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal, described the failure to comply with s 45(2) as “purely technical” and “not such as to merit any interference by this Court with the sentence.” If there be error in the present case, it is not of that kind.
	
	
	In my view, a fair reading of his Honour’s remarks as a whole does disclose that he concluded that there was no alternative to imprisonment because of the disturbing features of the offences which he identified, referred to at [18]-[19] above, together with the need for general deterrence. Accordingly, this was a reasoned decision and the requirements of s 5(1) of the CSP Act and s 17A(1) and (2) of the Crimes Act were met. Consideration of alternatives to full time imprisonment is another matter, dealt with by the next ground of appeal.
	
	
	However, I cannot accept the Crown prosecutor’s arguments in relation to s 5(2) of the CSP Act. Mr Game pointed out that, although the longer sentence was for the Commonwealth offence, his Honour pronounced sentence in respect of the State offence first. In doing so, he did not address the issues raised by subs (2) at all. Even if it appears to a Court, in terms of subs (1), that there is no alternative to a sentence of imprisonment, subs (2) requires further consideration of that issue if the term of imprisonment is to be 6 months or less. Mr Game rightly described the subsection as “an anti-short sentence provision”, requiring the court to be “very careful about sentencing people to gaol for short periods of time.” Particularly is this so when a court is dealing with a young offender of prior good character.
	
	
	His Honour gave no reasons for imposing a 6 month term, as expressly required by subs (2), and it is apparent that he did not consider the provision. It is no answer to say, pragmatically, that that term was wholly concurrent with the sentence for the Commonwealth offence and made no difference to the overall outcome. Such an approach would be inconsistent with the need to assess the appropriate sentence for each offence emphasised by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. I am satisfied that his Honour was in error in this respect.
	


Ground 3 – Alternatives to full time imprisonment


	
	Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455, 159 A Crim R 154, was a case concerned with periodic detention. However, in the course of his judgment Johnson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreed, considered in general terms the process of a court’s determination whether imprisonment should be imposed and, if so, the manner in which it should be served. In doing so his Honour referred to a case concerned with periodic detention: R v Wegener [1999] NSWCCA 405. However, he also referred to s 5 of the CSP Act and two cases concerned with suspended sentences: R v Foster [2001] 33 MVR 565 and Zamagias (supra).
	
	
	His Honour summarised the position at [70] – [72] (165 – 166) as follows:
	


“70 The first question to be asked and answered is whether there are any alternatives to the imposition of a term of imprisonment. Section 5 prohibits a Court from imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless the Court is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. At this stage in the process, the only consideration is whether a sentence of imprisonment should be imposed, and not the manner in which that sentence of imprisonment is to be served: Zamagias at [25].

71 The second step is reached where the Court has determined that no penalty is appropriate other than a sentence of imprisonment. The Court is next to determine what the term of that sentence should be. This has been regarded as the first step of a two-step approach: Foster at [30]; Zamagias at [26]. The determination of the term is to be made without regard to whether the sentence will be immediately served or the manner in which it is to be served. This is because any of the alternatives available in respect of a sentence of imprisonment can only be considered once the sentence has been imposed. It follows that the term of the sentence cannot be influenced by what order might be made after the sentence has been imposed. The sentence cannot be increased because it is to be served by way of periodic detention: Wegener at [22]; Zamagias at [26].

72 The third stage is reached once the length of the sentence of imprisonment has been determined. The Court is then to consider whether any alternative to full-time imprisonment is available in respect of that term and whether any available alternative should be utilised. The availability of an alternative to full-time custody will generally be governed by the length of the term that has been determined, subject to the restrictions or preconditions imposed by the legislature on a particular sentencing alternative. The appropriateness of an alternative to full-time custody will depend upon a number of factors; one of importance being whether such an alternative would result in a sentence that reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfils the manifold purpose of punishment. The Court in choosing an alternative to full-time custody cannot lose sight of the fact that the more lenient the alternative, the less likely it is to fulfil all the purposes of punishment: Zamagias at [28].”


	
	I have dealt with the first of the questions referred to by his Honour, whether there are any alternatives to the imposition of a term of imprisonment. What is at issue under this ground are the second and third steps, referred to by his Honour at [71] as the “two-step approach”. As to that, his Honour said [74]:
	


“74 Having determined the appropriate sentence, the Court must explain the sentence imposed. This may require, in an appropriate case, some discussion of the alternatives available and why a particular alternative has been chosen. However, it is unnecessary that a sentencing court expressly state that it has applied these two steps in arriving at the sentence imposed. In particular, merely because a court has not expressly indicated that it has taken the two-step approach to the determination of the sentence of imprisonment, it does not follow that it has failed to carry out the sentencing exercise in this manner: Zamagias at [30].”


	
	That passage should be read bearing in mind an observation his Honour made earlier, at [63]:
	


“63 However, the nature of the sentence imposed, and the failure to record that a two-stage approach has been taken, may lead the Court to examine carefully the findings made by the sentencing Judge to determine whether the sentence is erroneous: Foster at paragraph 35; Zamagias at [30].”


	
	The requirement that the term of a sentence be decided before determination of the manner in which it is to be served was described by Mr Game, also rightly, as an “anti-tailoring provision.” There is no restriction on the length of the term of imprisonment that can be suspended under s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act. However, the power to suspend a sentence under the CSP Act is confined to sentences of 2 years or less: s 12(1), as is the power to make a sentence the subject of an ICO: s 7(1). It is only a term of imprisonment of 18 months or less which may be directed to be served by way of home detention: s 6(1). An ICO or home detention are available in respect of Commonwealth offences: s 20AB of the Crimes Act, reg 6 of the Crimes Regulations 1990 (C’th).
	
	
	As Johnson J made clear in Douar at [71], citing the judgment of Howie J in Zamagias at [26], a court must not increase an otherwise appropriate sentence because it can be accommodated by one of those alternatives, nor should it decrease an otherwise appropriate sentence so as to make one of them available. Equally, as Mr Game pointed out, a court should not pass a short full time term of imprisonment for an offence, to be served concurrently with another full time sentence, when that offence should properly be dealt with by a longer term of imprisonment to be served by one of the alternatives to full time custody.  
	
	
	Plainly enough, his Honour did not adopt the two step approach in the present case. As is apparent from the passage of his remarks quoted at [20] above, his Honour ruled out suspended sentences and determined, without more, that custodial sentences must be imposed. He then proceeded to pass sentence for each of the offences. As it happens, the length of the sentence for each offence was such that the alternatives not only of suspended sentences but also an ICO and home detention were available. The gravamen of this ground is that his Honour’s reasons disclose that he failed adequately to consider suspending the sentences and made no reference at all to the options of an ICO or home detention.
	
	
	Here also, the Crown prosecutor responded that the effect of what his Honour said in the quoted passage, in the context of the remarks as a whole, was that the offences called for terms of imprisonment and that none of the alternatives to their being served full time was appropriate. He argued that his Honour’s specific reference to the possibility of suspending the sentences arose from the fact that sentencing submissions had focused upon that option, but this did not mean that his Honour overlooked the other two options. Home detention was not raised in submissions but an ICO was.
	
	
	Indeed, the Crown prosecutor questioned whether home detention would have been available. He referred to s 76 of the CSP Act which provides that home detention is not available for certain offences. Among them are “sexual assaults of adults or children or sexual offences involving children”: par (b). He submitted that the present offences could be classified as “sexual offences involving children.” The question was dealt with only briefly in submissions, and I was not referred to any authority on it. I incline to the view that the paragraph is directed to sexual activity with children rather than accessing or possessing material depicting it. However, I do not find it necessary to express any concluded view about the matter.
	
	
	In my view, this ground is made out. Consideration of alternatives to full time custody was at the forefront of this sentencing exercise. I have referred at [20] above to the acknowledgment by the Crown prosecutor before his Honour that suspended sentences were not beyond the pale. Of course, his Honour was not bound by that acknowledgement, but it heightened the need for reasons to be given for rejecting not only suspended sentences but the other alternatives. Even if the submission of the Crown prosecutor in this court that home detention was not available is sound, an ICO was another clearly available option. Of course, these options were available to both sentences, and it does appear to me that in respect of the State offence his Honour saw the imposition of a short custodial sentence as a practical approach consistent with his view that concurrent sentences were called for. I am satisfied that, in doing so, his Honour fell into the error identified by Mr Game, that is, imposing a short custodial sentence without considering whether a longer sentence to be served otherwise than in full time custody was the appropriate disposition.
	
	
	His Honour was faced with a difficult sentencing exercise. I am mindful of the heavy burden shouldered daily by District Court judges in sentencing offenders in many and varied matters, and I have no wish to add to the complexities which already attend that process. However, I am satisfied that in respect of the sentences for both offences his Honour’s approach failed to meet the requirements of the legislation and relevant authority.
	


Re-sentence


	
	Having determined that the sentencing process miscarried, it is not necessary to decide the ground that the sentences are manifestly excessive. It is for this Court to re-sentence the applicant in the exercise of its independent discretion.
	
	
	Counsel in the District Court supplied his Honour with summaries of a number of cases, from which a pattern of sentence was sought to be derived, and it appropriate to refer to them. I have not included four of the cases referred to in defence submissions, either because they were cases of markedly different criminality, including disseminating or transmitting child pornography, or cases turning upon particular factual findings or discretionary considerations which put them outside any discernible sentencing pattern.
	
	
	This leaves ten cases, comprising six decisions of this Court, two from Victoria, one from Queensland and one from Western Australia. They are: R v Porte [2015] NSWCCA 174, R v De Leeuw [2015] NSWCCA 183, R v Booth [2009] NSWCCA 89, Mouscas v R [2008] NSWCCA 181, James v R [2009] NSWCCA 62, R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370, 162 A Crim R 29, DPP (Cth) v Guest [2014] VSCA 29, DPP v Smith [2010] VSCA 215, R v Gordon; Ex Parte DPP (Cth) [2009] QCA 209, Smit v State of Western Australia [2011] WASCA 124.
	
	
	Of course, regard should be had to these cases on the basis sanctioned by the High Court in Hili and Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45, 242 CLR 520, especially at [54]. I do not propose to examine them individually. Most of them involved accessing and possessing child pornography, but in one of those (Guest) there was also a transmission charge. Two of the cases (Booth, Smit) involved possession only, and one (Gent) was a case of importing child pornography.
	
	
	In eight of the cases there were full time prison terms, either affirmed or imposed after a successful Crown appeal. Head sentences ranged between 18 months and 3 years, and minimum terms (non-parole periods or with recognizance release orders) between 6 months and 1 year and 9 months. In the remaining two cases Crown appeals against alternatives to full time imprisonment were unsuccessful. In DPP v Smith there was a wholly suspended sentence on one count and the Victorian equivalent of an ICO on the other. In Gordon there were concurrent suspended sentences on two counts.
	
	
	All these cases were objectively more serious than the present case. In particular, they involved more material, in most cases much more. In Gent a combination of videos and images totalled well into the hundreds. In eight other cases the combination of videos, files and images was in the thousands, in some cases the tens of thousands. This included the cases of Smith and Gordon in which, as I have said, sentences not involving full time imprisonment were upheld. In both those cases the offences were seen as not unduly serious and there was favourable subjective material, including good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor pointed to Booth, in which the amount of offending material, while greater than the present case, was relatively low. In that case, after a successful Crown appeal, a full time sentence of 2 years with a non-parole period of 6 months was imposed. However, that offender was 61 years old with an unfavourable criminal history, having served sentences of imprisonment for possession of child pornography and sexual offences committed against his son.
	
	
	In Porte, Johnson J (with whom Leeming JA and Beech-Jones J agreed) examined the sentences passed in some previous cases (including some referred to in the present case) at [152]-[153]. Again, those cases, all resulting in terms of full time imprisonment, were considerably more serious than the present case, as was Porte itself.
	
	
	This is not to deny that offences of this kind are serious and prevalent, and that considerations of denunciation and deterrence are important in sentencing for them. This is well established by authority, as are the various factors which fall to be considered in assessing the gravity of a particular offence. Helpful reference of those authorities, here and interstate, is to be found in the judgment of Johnson J in Porte at [59]-[72]. His Honour revisited authorities on the issue in De Leeuw at [70]-[72], as did Hoeben CJ at CL more recently in Fitzgerald v R [2015] NSWCCA 266 at [33]-[34].
	
	
	In this line of authority general deterrence is sometimes described as “paramount” or “the primary sentencing consideration.” It is said that, absent exceptional circumstances, a sentence of imprisonment involving full time custody is “ordinarily” warranted. It is also said that less weight is given than in other cases to the fact that an offender has prior good character and favourable prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	These pronouncements are a guide to the exercise of discretion in child pornography cases; but, of course, are not prescriptive of the result in a particular case, which must turn on its facts and circumstances. In EF v R [2015] NSWCCA 36, Simpson J (as she then was) referred to the line of authority that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, a full time custodial sentence should be imposed upon an offender who has been substantially involved in the supply of prohibited drugs. Her Honour said at [10]:
	


“Nothing in any of those decisions obviates the need for sentencing judges to consider the circumstances of each case individually, including the availability (in a practical sense) of alternatives to full-time custody.”

At [11], her Honour cited a passage in the judgment of Priestley JA in R v Cacciola (1988) 104 A Crim R 178 at 183-4. His Honour referred to the proposition that drug dealing to a substantial degree calls for the imposition of a prison sentence as something which the Court continues to consider as “the proper approach to sentencing, always bearing in mind the need to consider every convicted person’s case on its own merits and in its own circumstances.”


	
	The proposition that offences such as the applicant’s should ordinarily be visited with a custodial sentence should be approached in this way. In Guest (supra) the leading judgment was delivered by Coghlan JA, with whom Weinberg and Whelan JJA agreed. At [24], albeit speaking of a sentencing regime before the maximum sentence for the relevant Commonwealth offences was increased, his Honour said, “I accept that not all offenders who possess child pornography, or for that matter cause it to be transmitted, must necessarily receive an immediate custodial sentence.”
	
	
	In Cacciola (at 184) Priestley JA added that what he described as the “rule” governing sentence for the substantial supply of prohibited drugs “must be taken into account and given serious consideration by sentencing judges on every occasion when there is a case of this kind, although the sentencing judge must, in the end, always exercise his or her own discretion, but the sentencing policy or rule is not to be neglected or put out of sight, nor should there be excessively liberal interpretation of the phrase ‘exceptional circumstances’.”
	
	
	I approach the present case guided by this authority. I am mindful of the repeated pronouncements that offences of this kind should ordinarily be visited with a full time custodial sentence and of the factors, particularly general deterrence, which are the foundation of that approach. In the present case I agree with his Honour that the objective gravity of each offence is between the low end and the mid-range, and that terms of imprisonment are called for. In my view, the appropriate term for each offence is 12 months, and I also agree with his Honour that it is appropriate that those terms be served concurrently.
	
	
	However, the particular features of this case persuade me that, while terms of imprisonment are called for, full time custody is not. Terms of imprisonment to be served by way of an alternative to full time custody are by no means devoid of deterrent effect, both personal and general. In this case I am satisfied that such an alternative is appropriate.
	
	
	I have reached that conclusion with regard, firstly, to the limited amount of access to pornographic material and the relatively small amount of material in the applicant’s possession. In that respect I have regard to the matters which were not the subject of the charges, the occasions upon which the applicant entered certain search terms and the thumbnail files. The applicant’s motive for his offending is undoubtedly disturbing and reprehensible, but what is significant is that he does not appear to have been driven by a sexual interest in children and, in the light of the psychological material, is unlikely to reoffend in this way.
	
	
	I have regard, secondly, to his age at the time of the offending, his good character, his undoubted remorse and his promising engagement in psychological counselling. I agree with his Honour’s finding that he has good prospects of rehabilitation, and with his Honour’s assessment of the utilitarian value of his early pleas of guilty. All these favourable subjective matters are deserving of appropriate weight.
	
	
	On re-sentence I would take into account the period of a little over 2 months imprisonment which the applicant has already served. The Court received an affidavit in which he describes the incidents of his incarceration, and from which it is clear that it has been a stressful and chastening experience for him. Giving him credit for that period, I would reduce the sentence of 12 months for each offence to 10 months.
	
	
	I would direct that those sentences be served by way of an ICO, if the applicant is assessed as suitable for such an order. The ICO was examined in the decision of five judges of this Court in R v Pogson & Ors [2012] NSWCCA 225, 82 NSWLR 60. In a joint judgment, McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J observed at [106] (84) that it is “a substantial punishment to be utilised in an appropriate case”, although “as with all sentencing options which do not involve immediate incarceration, it may also reflect a significant degree of leniency” (citing Whelan v R [2012] NSWCCA 147). Their Honours added at [109]:
	


“However, as we have noted, the stringent conditions attached to an ICO ensure that an offender subject to such an order is not living a carefree existence amongst the community. An ICO deprives an offender of his or her liberty in a real and not merely fictional sense.”

In EF (supra), a case raising issues similar to the present case, Schmidt J also examined the incidents of an ICO at [49]-[52].


	
	In my view, the appropriate sentence on each charge is imprisonment for 10 months, to be served concurrently.
	
	
	I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, and quash the sentences passed in the District Court. I would refer the applicant for assessment as to his suitability for intensive correction in the community, pursuant to Div 3 of Pt 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I would adjourn the proceedings for that purpose and would grant the applicant bail.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Hidden J.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons of Hidden J. I have come to a different view about the grounds of appeal and the appropriate orders. I respectfully adopt Hidden J’s summary of the facts and of the applicant’s subjective case; of the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence; and his Honour’s identification of relevant provisions outline of applicable principles.
	
	
	Before turning to the grounds, I propose to address the context in which the sentences were imposed. Although the sentencing judge was obliged to impose sentences for each offence, the offending conduct was, effectively, the same conduct, although the elements of the two offences differed. Thus there was no basis for distinguishing, for example, the objective seriousness of the offence under s 471.19(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) (using a carriage service to access child pornography) (the Commonwealth offence) from that under s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (being in possession of child pornography) (the State offence). Nor was there any proper basis for distinguishing between the sentences imposed for the two offences other than by reference to the different maximum penalty for the two offences (10 years for the State offence and 15 years for the Commonwealth offence) or by reason of the need to take into account totality.
	
	
	In my view, this feature of the sentencing exercise led the sentencing judge to avoid repetition of concepts where the same matters were relevant to sentencing for the Commonwealth and State offences.
	
	
	In addressing the grounds, I propose to address the second ground before the first since the sentencing judge’s reasons addressed the Commonwealth offence before turning to the State offence.
	


Ground 2: the sentencing judge failed to apply s 17A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) when imposing a sentence for the Commonwealth offence


	
	Section 17A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Commonwealth Crimes Act) required the sentencing judge to consider all other available sentences; and, having considered all other available sentences, pass a sentence of imprisonment only if satisfied that no other sentence was appropriate in the circumstances of the case.
	
	
	In order to explain why I am not persuaded that the second ground (and, indeed, any of the first three grounds) has been made out, it is necessary to reproduce a longer extract from the remarks on sentence than appears in the reasons of Hidden J. Although the paragraphs of Frearson DCJ’s judgment were not numbered, I propose to number them so as to be able to identify particular passages more easily in the reasons that follow.
	
	
	The sentencing judge said:
	


“[1]   The facts involve a very deliberate accessing of child pornography for the proffered reason and it seems to me that the circumstances of this case are particularly reprehensible and particularly heinous.

[2]   I do find that the Commonwealth matter is an objectively quite serious matter in the range that I have already adverted to. Those who seek pleasure, sexual or otherwise, from the sexual exploitation and degradation of children need to be adequately punished and like-minded persons need to be deterred and particularly when you are talking about children as young as six being treated in this disgusting way.

[3]   I have thought long and hard about what sentences I should impose and whether I can suspend the sentences and, in my view, there is no alternative to custody. No alternatives would accommodate the purposes of sentencing in this particular case. I propose to impose a custodial sentence in each case.

[4]   I have been urged to suspend the sentence in each case and that is a matter I have pondered on for a number of weeks now. It is tempting to suspend a sentence so that a young man doesn’t have to go to gaol, but weighing all the considerations up, it seems to me that suspending a sentence wouldn’t adequately accommodate the purposes of sentencing and I don’t propose to fully suspend the sentence.

[5]   I propose to impose a custodial sentence for the State matter, taking into account the commonality. I impose a sentence of six months imprisonment fixed term from today which will expire on 10 March 2016.

[6]   For the Commonwealth matter, I impose a sentence of 12 months imprisonment. I direct the offender be released on 10 March 2016, that is after six months, upon entering into a recognisance pursuant to section 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, self in $100 without surety, to be of good behaviour for a period of six months and to appear to be sentenced if called upon to do so in respect to any breach within the said period.”

[Paragraph numbers added.]


	
	In my view, his Honour said, and ought properly be understood to have said, the following:
	



	
	The offences (expressly the Commonwealth offence, but also, by necessary implication, the State offence) were objectively serious ([1] and [2]).
	
	
	General deterrence was of particular importance having regard to the conduct and its seriousness ([2]).
	
	
	His Honour had considered the available alternatives to a sentence of imprisonment ([3]).
	
	
	His Honour had also considered whether, if a sentence of imprisonment were imposed, it ought be suspended ([3] and [4]).
	
	
	Having considered all of these matters, his Honour nonetheless considered that a sentence of full-time custody was required as it was the only sentence that would take sufficient account of the purpose of general deterrence in the present case ([4]).
	



	
	I do not consider it to have been necessary for his Honour to list all the available alternatives and to say why, in respect of each, a sentence which involved one of more of those alternatives would not have been appropriate. I regard his Honour’s reasons as sufficient to elucidate the reasoning and to demonstrate compliance with s 17A.
	
	
	For these reasons, I am not persuaded that the second ground has been made out.
	


Ground 1: the sentencing judge failed to apply s 5 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) when imposing a sentence for the State offence


	
	In the remarks on sentence, the imposition of the sentence for the State offence preceded the imposition of the sentence for the Commonwealth offence. However, it does not follow that the sentence for the State offence was determined before that of the Commonwealth offence. Remarks on sentence must be read fairly as a whole. The sequence in which the reasons are expressed does not necessarily correspond with the order in which the reasons which led to the result was arrived at. Remarks on sentence do not necessarily reflect simultaneous thought processes, although, especially when they are delivered ex tempore, they may do.
	
	
	In the present case, the proceedings on sentence commenced on 31 July 2015 at which time his Honour heard evidence and submissions. The proceedings were adjourned to 11 September 2015. The expressed purpose of the adjournment was to permit his Honour to reflect on the evidence and consider the sentence to be imposed. As his Honour said on 31 July 2015:
	


“What I propose to do, I find these State Commonwealth things very complicated and these particular charges very difficult to sentence so I do propose to put it over and to reread all the material and to work out what I’m going to do with it. I’ll just come up with a date.”


	
	In these circumstances, and having regard to the structure of the overall sentence, I consider the better view to be that his Honour determined the sentence for the Commonwealth offence first. This is reflected in the longer sentence for that offence (based, presumably, on the greater maximum penalty). When the sentence for the Commonwealth offence is viewed as the starting point, the way in which the sentence for the State offence was intended to operate becomes clearer.
	
	
	When his Honour came to sentence the applicant for the State offence (on my hypothesis, after determining the sentence for the Commonwealth offence), his Honour did not restate the findings relating to: objective seriousness or need for general deterrence; or consideration of the alternatives to full-time custody, since they were common to both. Moreover the requirements imposed on sentencing judges by s 17A in the Commonwealth Act corresponded with those imposed by the requirements in s 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and therefore did not need to be restated.
	
	
	However, by reason of the length of the custodial sentence to be imposed, his Honour was obliged, with respect to the State offence, to comply with the additional requirements in s 5(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The requirements of s 5(2) cannot be fulfilled unless separate consideration is given to them. Thus, compliance with s 5(1) does not constitute compliance with s 5(2) because s 5(2) provides an additional, important safeguard to offenders and amounts to a further restriction on the imposition of relatively short (six months or less) custodial sentences, which are regarded as particularly disruptive to offenders and potentially inimical to rehabilitation.
	
	
	Apart from the reasons that applied both to the Commonwealth offence and the State offence (as to objective seriousness, the need for general deterrence and his Honour’s conclusion that a full-time custodial sentence was the only appropriate sentence), the only reasons given that pertain exclusively to the State offence are in [5] above.
	
	
	The issue that arose when determining what sentence ought be imposed for the State offence, was that the imposition of any sentence that included any alternative to full-time custody would result in an additional penalty being imposed for the State offence. If, however, a custodial sentence was imposed for the State offence, which was wholly concurrent with, and not longer than, the custodial component for the Commonwealth offence, there would be no effective additional penalty for the State offence. His Honour chose the latter course.
	
	
	In my view, a fair reading of the remarks, albeit brief, indicates that his Honour’s reason for imposing a sentence of six months in custody for the State offence was to take “into account the commonality”. This, in my view, constituted a reason for deciding that no penalty other than imprisonment was appropriate, as required by s 5(2)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. This reason also qualified as a reason for deciding not to make an order allowing the applicant to participate in an intervention program or other program for treatment or rehabilitation, as required by s 5(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In the particular circumstances of the present case, such an order for treatment or rehabilitation, far from amounting to a more lenient alternative, would have imposed an extra penalty on the applicant. The effect of the imposition of the sentence for the State offence was not to put the applicant into custody for six months: he was already required to be there because of the sentence imposed for the Commonwealth offence.
	
	
	His Honour’s articulation of the reason, “taking into account the commonality”, was, in my view, sufficient to comply with s 5(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	I do not intend to suggest by my reading of his Honour’s remarks on sentence that any assumption ought be made that the provisions governing sentencing for Commonwealth and State offences have been complied with in any given case. The sentencing judge was bound by the applicable legislation. His Honour’s reasoning processes are to be gleaned from the remarks. However, sentencing judges, in demonstrating their compliance with provisions such as s 17A of the Commonwealth Act or s 5(1) and (2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, ought not be required to undertake any formulaic recitation of the applicable provisions for the benefit of this Court, as long as their compliance is sufficiently shown by the reasons when read fairly as a whole, as I consider occurred in the present case.
	
	
	For these reasons, I am not persuaded that the first ground has been made out.
	


Ground 3: alleged failure to consider alternatives to full time imprisonment


	
	For the reasons given with respect to the first two grounds, I am not satisfied that this ground has been made out.
	


Ground 4: sentence imposed is manifestly excessive


	
	Because of the view to which I have come with respect to the other grounds, I am required to address this ground but can do so briefly since my view is a minority one.
	
	
	I do not regard the sentence his Honour imposed as being manifestly excessive. Although numbers of images are not irrelevant, they are no more determinative in sentencing than the weight of a prohibited drug: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [67]-[73]. There is no single correct sentence in any particular case: Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 612 per Mason J. Having regard to the seriousness of the offences and the nature of the images downloaded, it was open to his Honour to impose the sentences that were imposed and to structure them so as to require the applicant to serve six months in full-time custody.
	


Proposed orders


	
	I would propose that the leave to appeal be granted and that the appeal be dismissed.
	


CCA bench reconvened on 4 March 2016 for final order


	
	THE COURT: The Court has received an intensive correction order assessment report from which it appears Mr Fedele's personal and family circumstances are stable, he has been assessed as low risk of re-offending, he accepts responsibility for his offences, he has been undergoing psychological treatment to address his sexual offending and he is willing to continue to do so, and there is community service work available to him.
	
	
	The author of the report has assessed him as suitable for an intensive correction order and notes that he has signed an undertaking to comply with all the obligations of such an order. Accordingly, Mr Fedele is sentenced on each charge to concurrent terms of imprisonment for 10 months to be served by way of an intensive correctional order and to commence today. The intensive correction order is subject to the mandatory conditions imposed by clause 186 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2014.

2426742,NSW Crime Commission v D150 [2015] NSWSC 1842,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By summons filed in Court on 3 December 2015, the New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission) seeks an ex parte order pursuant to s 35A(5) of the Crime Commission Act 2012 (NSW) (the Act) for leave to question each of the defendants and have them produce certain documents or things relating to an alleged joint attempt to possess commercial quantities of two types of unlawfully imported border controlled drugs. The possession of such drugs is an offence contrary to s 307.5(1), with s 11.1(1) and s 11.2A(1), of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), Sch 1 (the Criminal Code).
	
	
	The allegation that the Commission proposes to investigate is that each of the defendants is part of a syndicate involved in a particular importation of large amounts of two prohibited drugs with a substantial combined street value.
	
	
	The Commission also seeks ancillary orders, including a non-disclosure and non-publication order pursuant to s 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Act 2010 (NSW).
	
	
	The application was heard in closed court on 3 December 2015. Ms Drennan appeared for the Commission. I am satisfied that it was appropriate to close the court, having regard to the potential risk to the defendants if their identity becomes known. Each has been selected by the Commission to be examined at a compulsory examination. Although none of the defendants has a choice about the matter, their compliance with any order I might make granting leave to the Commission to examine them might render them subject to reprisals from those associated with the alleged syndicate if their identity becomes known.
	


Relevant legislation

The Crime Commission Act 2012 (NSW)


	
	Section 3 of the Act identifies as the object of the Act: “to reduce the incidence of organised and other serious crime”. Section 10(1) provides that the principal functions of the Commission include:
	


“(g) with the approval of the Management Committee, to work in co-operation with such persons or authorities of the Commonwealth, the State or another State or Territory (including any task force and any member of a task force) as the Commission considers appropriate.”


	
	Section 35A was inserted into the Act by the Crime Commission Legislation Amendment Act 2014 (NSW), which commenced on the day of Royal assent, 28 November 2014. Section 35A provides:
	


“35A Leave of Supreme Court to take evidence from accused person about the offence

(1) This section applies to a person who is the subject of a current charge for an offence, and relates to the taking of evidence from the person in relation to the subject matter of the offence.

(2) The person cannot be:

(a) questioned under section 24 at a hearing before the Commission, or

(b) required under section 24 or 29 to produce a document or thing,

in relation to matters relating to the subject matter of the offence

without the leave of the Supreme Court.

(3) Evidence obtained pursuant to leave granted for the purposes of this section cannot be used against the person in any civil or criminal proceeding (other than a proceeding for an offence against this Act or an offence relating to the falsity of evidence given by the witness) or in any disciplinary proceeding, but is not inadmissible as against other persons.

Note. See section 39A (3) and (4) for derivative evidence.

(4) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court ex parte for leave supported by an affidavit of an officer of the Commission stating:

(a) that the officer:

(i) believes that the questioning or requirement is in the public interest notwithstanding that the questioning or requirement relates or may relate to the subject matter of the offence, and

(ii) suspects that the questioning or requirement is necessary to fully investigate the matter referred to in the copy of a notice accompanying a summons issued to the person, and

(b) the grounds on which the belief and suspicion are based.

(5) The Supreme Court may grant leave if it is satisfied that any prejudicial effect that is likely to arise to the person’s trial from the proposed questioning or requirement is outweighed by the public interest in using the Commission’s powers to ensure that a matter referred to in the copy of a notice accompanying a summons issued to the person is fully investigated.

(6) Leave may be granted unconditionally or subject to conditions imposed by the Supreme Court.

(7) If leave is granted, the Commission must, before the person is questioned in relation to matters the subject of the grant of leave, serve on the person notice of the grant of leave.

(8) The notice must inform the person of any right under another law to seek a review of the grant of leave and of the right to make an application for assistance under section 42.

(9) Nothing in this section limits the application to an application for leave of any of the functions and procedures of the Supreme Court in relation to proceedings that may be dealt with ex parte before that Court.”


	
	Sections 39 and 39A of the Act make provision for the (direct) use and derivative use that can be made of answers given or documents or things produced by witnesses as a result of the Commission’s compulsory powers. As s 35A(3) prohibits the use of evidence obtained from persons who have been examined or required to produce documents under s 35A, it is necessary for present purposes to set out only the following extracts of ss 39 and 39A.
	


“39 Privilege concerning answers and documents

(1) A witness summoned to attend or appearing before the Commission at a hearing is not (except as provided by section 40) excused from answering any question or producing any document or thing on the ground that the answer or production may incriminate or tend to incriminate the witness, or on any other ground of privilege, or on the ground of a duty of secrecy or other restriction on disclosure, or on any other ground.

. . .

39A Derivative evidence

(1) Any further information, evidence, document or thing (the derivative evidence) obtained as a result of:

(a) the questioning under section 24 of a witness at a hearing before the Commission, or

(b) the production under section 24 or 29 of a document or thing,

(the original evidence) is not inadmissible in any civil or criminal proceeding or in any disciplinary proceeding.

(2) Without limiting subsection (1), the derivative evidence is not inadmissible on the ground:

(a) that the original evidence had to be given or produced, or

(b) that the original evidence might incriminate the witness, or

(c) that the witness was questioned (or required to produce the document or thing) in relation to the subject matter of the offence for which the witness was charged before the charge was laid, or

(d) that the original evidence was obtained at a hearing when the witness was questioned (or required to produce the document or thing) pursuant to leave granted for the purposes of section 35A in relation to a particular offence and the original evidence related to another offence, being an offence with which the witness was not yet charged.

(3) The derivative evidence is not admissible against the witness where the witness was questioned (or required to produce the document or thing) pursuant to leave granted for the purposes of section 35A in relation to the subject matter of the offence for which the witness was charged.

(4) However, an exception under subsection (3) does not apply if the derivative evidence could have been obtained (or its significance understood) without the testimony of the witness.

(5) Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 39.”


	
	Section 45 of the Act provides:
	


“45 Publication or disclosure of evidence

(1) The Commission may direct that:

(a) any evidence given before it, or

(b) the contents of any document, or a description of any thing, produced to the Commission or seized under a search warrant, or

(c) any information that might enable a person who has given or may be about to give evidence before the Commission to be identified or located, or

(d) the fact that any person has given or may be about to give evidence at a hearing,

must not be published, or must not be published except in such manner, and to such persons, as the Commission specifies.

(2) The Commission must give such a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence.

(3) A person must not make a publication in contravention of a direction given under this section.

Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both.”


	
	The Management Committee of the Commission is constituted by s 49(1) of the Act. Its members include the Commissioner of Police: s 50(1). Section 51(1) provides that its principal functions include:
	


“(a) to refer (by a written notice in accordance with section 54 (1)) matters relating to relevant criminal activities to the Commission for investigation and . . .”


	
	Section 54 of the Act relevantly provides:
	


“54 Notices referring matters for investigation

(1) The notice referring a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity, serious crime concern or criminal activity of a criminal group to the Commission for investigation or renewing such a reference:

. . .

(b) must describe the general nature of the circumstances or allegations constituting the relevant criminal activity, serious crime concern or criminal activity of the criminal group, and

(c) must set out the general purpose of the investigation.”

The evidence


	
	The Commission relies on an affidavit of Robert Tuckerman sworn 1 December 2015. The deponent is one of the Commission’s officers and is employed as an Assistant Director of Criminal Investigations. He manages the plaintiff’s Organised Crime Directorate and supervises the managers and analysts working on the Commission’s criminal and financial investigations. He is familiar with the relevant joint New South Wales and Commonwealth investigations. The facts set out below derive from Mr Tuckerman’s affidavit.
	


Background facts


	
	On 18 February 2014 the Management Committee, pursuant to s 10(1)(g) of the Act gave approval to the Commission to work in co-operation with the Organised Crime Squad (OCS), which forms part of the New South Wales Police Force.
	
	
	On 21 July 2015 the Management Committee, by notice, referred matters to the Commission for investigation pursuant to s 51(1)(a). The notice set out the nature and purpose of the investigation as follows:
	


“The general nature of the circumstances or allegations constituting relevant criminal activity within the meaning of the Act (in particular paragraph 54 (1)(b) and subsection 4 (1)) to which Matters for investigation relate is that the Commission has information indicating that certain persons may have engaged in, may be engaging in, and may be about to engage in illegal drug trafficking involving the distribution of . . . prohibited drugs contrary to ss 24 to 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (:the IDMTI Act”) and related money laundering activities.

The general purpose of the investigation is:

(a)   to investigate the matters; and

(b)   to obtain evidence for use in criminal prosecutions of, and in proceedings under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 against, any persons found by the investigation to have engaged in criminal activity.”


	
	Each of the defendants was charged with two offences of possessing prohibited drugs. The circumstance that two offences were charged arises from the fact that two types of drug were involved, although the Crown case is that the possession was part of the same criminal operation contrary to s 307.5(1) with s 11.1(1) and s 11.2A(1) of the Criminal Code. These charges were laid by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) as a result of its own investigation, in which, according to Mr Tuckerman’s affidavit, the Commission had “no practical involvement”.
	
	
	These charges are presently listed for mention in the Local Court before the end of court term. Ms Drennan informed me that the Commission planned, if leave was granted under s 35A, to conduct examinations within a fortnight.
	


Consideration

The context and legislative purpose of s 35A


	
	In X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 20; 248 CLR 92 (X7), the High Court held that where a person has been charged with an offence, but not yet tried, he or she could not be compulsorily examined about the subject matter of the pending charge. The High Court held that the applicable legislation was not sufficiently clear to authorise such a fundamental departure from the accusatorial nature of the criminal justice system.
	
	
	In Lee v NSW Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 251 CLR 196, the High Court, by majority, held that s 31D(1)(a) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) empowered the Court to make an order for the examination of a person charged with criminal offences about conduct that was the subject of criminal charges against that person.
	
	
	In Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20; 88 ALJR 656, the High Court considered s 13(9) of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 (NSW) (the 1985 Act). The 1985 Act has been replaced by the Act. However s 45 of the Act is in similar terms to the relevant provision under the 1985 Act, s 13(9).
	
	
	Section 35A of the Act, and related amendments, were introduced in 2014 in response to the decisions of the High Court in X7 and Lee v The Queen, which are referred to in the Second Reading Speech (which does not, however, refer to Lee v NSW Crime Commission). The purpose of s 35A was identified in the following terms in the Second Reading Speech (Legislative Assembly, 11 November 2014, page 2426ff):
	


“Situations where the commission compulsorily examines a person charged with an offence are infrequent, but when they arise they often involve homicide investigations or persons who are part of an organised criminal group—but not the principal—and it is necessary to establish the identity of other offenders and the circumstances surrounding the offence. There is thus a significant public interest in the New South Wales Crime Commission retaining full use of its powers of compulsory examination post-charge.”

Decisions considering s 35A


	
	As at the time these reasons were published, the decision of McCallum J in New South Wales Crime Commission v D109 [2015] NSWSC 1244 was the only published decision, although two other applications had been made by the Commission, which resulted in orders being made by this Court under s 35A. I am indebted to her Honour for her careful analysis of the cases that preceded the insertion of s 35A and associated amendments into the Act.
	


Whether an order under s 35A ought be granted in the present case


	
	Section 35A expressly empowers the Court to grant leave to the Commission to summon a person who is the subject of a current charge for an offence and take evidence from that person in relation to the subject matter of the offence. Parliament has thereby expressly evinced its intention to authorise a fundamental departure from the accusatorial nature of the criminal justice system, as it was described in X7.
	
	
	Section 35A entitles the Commission to apply to this Court, as it has done in the present case, ex parte.
	
	
	The statutory requirements for the Commission’s application to this Court have been met. Mr Tuckerman is an officer of the Commission: s 35A. His affidavit meets the requirements of s 35A(4)(a) and (b) in that he states that he believes that the questioning of the defendants and the requirements made of them is in the public interest notwithstanding that such questioning or requirements may relate to the subject matter of the offences with which each defendant is charged. He also deposes that the questioning and the requirements are necessary to investigate the matter referred to in the notice fully.
	
	
	In his affidavit, Mr Tuckerman also:
	



	
	sets out some of the information presently known about the importation referred to above ([19]-[36] of his affidavit);
	
	
	the specific involvement of the defendants in the criminal activity of the syndicate ([37]-[57] of his affidavit);
	
	
	investigations undertaken which show further involvement by the defendants ([58]-[78] of his affidavit); and
	
	
	what the Commission aims to achieve by questioning the defendants in compulsory examination if leave is granted under s 35A ([79]-[88] of his affidavit).
	



	
	Mr Tuckerman deposed that although, if leave is granted, the defendants will be questioned about matters which touch and concern their own alleged criminal conduct and the offences with which they have been charged, the defendants’ criminal conduct is “of little interest to the Commission’s investigation, and this information is not the goal of the hearing”.
	
	
	I am satisfied, on the basis of the material before me, that any prejudicial effect that is likely to arise to the trial of each defendant is outweighed by the public interest in using the Commission’s powers to ensure that the matter referred to in the notice is fully investigated. It is in the public interest that those who bear greater responsibility for the criminal conduct involved in the importation of distribution of prohibited drugs be held to account for their conduct. It is not in the public interest that those who play smaller roles and who are exposed to greater risk, for less reward, are held criminally responsible while the true progenitors and profiteers of the criminal enterprise escape detection with the consequence that they are not brought to trial.
	
	
	Having regard to the requirements of s 35A(7), (8) and the availability, by reason of s 42(2A), of legal and financial assistance to persons in respect of whom a grant of leave under s 35A has been made, I do not consider it necessary to impose any further conditions on the grant of leave.
	


Orders


	
	For the foregoing reasons, I made orders as follows in respect of each of the six named defendants at the conclusion of the ex parte hearing in closed court on 3 December 2015:
	



	
	In respect of each named defendant:
	
	
	Until further order of this court, pursuant to s 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Act 2010 (NSW) and upon the grounds set out in s 8(1)(a), (c) and (e) therein, there is to be no disclosure or publication of:
	



	
	the summons;
	
	
	the name of the Defendant;
	
	
	the evidence filed in support of the summons; and
	
	
	any transcript of the hearing of this matter,
	


subject to the requirements of s 35A(8) of the Crime Commission Act 2012 (NSW) and except for:


	
	the proper execution of the orders of the Court; and
	
	
	the proper processes of the NSW Crime Commission in pursuing its investigation pursuant to the Crime Commission Act 2012 as disclosed in evidence filed in support of the summons.
	



	
	Order (1) is to have effect throughout the Commonwealth.
	
	
	Leave is granted pursuant to s 35A of the Crime Commission Act 2012 to the Plaintiff, its officers and legal practitioners engaged or employed by it, to question and make requirements of the defendant during a hearing before the Commission pursuant to ss 24 and/or 29 of the Crime Commission Act 2012 in relation to the subject matter of offences he is currently charged with, namely two offences contrary to s 307.5(1), with ss 11.1(1), and 11.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).
	
	
	Order that:
	



	
	the first-named defendant be referred to by the pseudonym D150.
	
	
	the second-named defendant be referred to by the pseudonym D151.
	
	
	the third-named defendant be referred to by the pseudonym D152.
	
	
	the fourth-named defendant be referred to by the pseudonym D153.
	
	
	the fifth-named defendant be referred to by the pseudonym D154.
	
	
	the sixth-named defendant be referred to by the pseudonym D155.

		09 December 2015",2015-12-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2426768,Woods v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (No 2) [2015] NSWCA 399,"Judgment


	
	JUDGMENT of the COURT delivered by BASTEN JA: On 20 September 2013 the applicant, Andrew Keith Woods, was convicted and sentenced in the Local Court at Burwood on a charge of driving a motor vehicle whilst under the influence of methylamphetamine and amphetamine. The offence occurred on 25 July 2012. The applicant appealed pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) to the District Court against his conviction. The appeal was heard by Bennett DCJ in the District Court at Parramatta. On 22 May 2014 the judge dismissed the appeal.
	
	
	The present application is brought pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), there being no right of appeal from the judgment of the District Court. Further, as a result of the privative clause in s 176 of the District Court Act 1973 (NSW), the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court is limited to jurisdictional error on the part of the court below. [1] 
	
	
	Although the applicant referred to the “grounds of appeal” in a document which appears to have been treated as both a summons and a written submission, he limited the challenge to an allegation that his conviction was obtained by fraud (on the part of the police) and “was a ruling for an improper purpose in bad faith and with bias denying the plaintiff of natural justice.”
	
	
	These grounds use the language of judicial review for jurisdictional error. However, they are misapplied.
	
	
	When the applicant was stopped by police whilst driving his vehicle in Croydon Park, the officer who stopped him, Sergeant Heywood, gave evidence that he exhibited behaviour consistent with being under the influence of drugs, both by his erratic driving and evidence of his inability to comply with behavioural tests designed to reveal intoxication. The blood and urine samples taken from him at a local hospital were tested and revealed traces of amphetamine and methylamphetamine. A certificate from a pharmacologist averred that the levels revealed would be sufficient to impair a person’s ability to drive.
	
	
	On the face of it, this material was entirely unremarkable. The case run by the applicant in the District Court was that the stopping of the vehicle was, as Bennett DCJ described it, “a device”. [2]  Before Bennett DCJ, the applicant contended that he was “the target of other police in relation to another investigation and that the highway patrol officers here concerned were party to whatever the other officers were engaged upon.” [3]  Accordingly the stop was a mere device so that his vehicle could be secured and access obtained for the purpose of the other investigation.
	
	
	Bennett DCJ dealt with the evidence in the allegations put before him in this regard in the following passage: [4] 
	


“Whether or not this was a device to have Sergeant Heywood secure the appellant and his vehicle so that some controlled operation might have been pursued ultimately does not leave me in doubt about the evidence given by the sergeant. Even were it so, the sergeant’s evidence, unassailed, is that he saw the vehicle driven in an erratic fashion and he saw the symptoms as described, and he saw the failure of the sobriety test.

If I accept that evidence to the requisite standard, which I do, it matters not that the initial decision by the sergeant to take the step of observing the appellant rested upon what came to him from some other police officer responsible in some fashion for the other matter. That is neither here nor there. I am unable to say, I might add that, this is the case on the material that I have before me.”


	
	In other words, the applicant ran a case before the trial judge of misconduct on the part of the police. Not only did he fail to satisfy the trial judge that there was such misconduct but, as the judge pointed out, the nature of the misconduct would have been irrelevant.
	
	
	The submissions in this Court reveal that the applicant was seeking to rerun that case. However, he sought to do so on a misconceived basis. For example, his submissions with respect to fraud commenced with the following proposition:
	


“DCJ Bennett from the 3rd day of proceedings (transcript 16/05/2014 lines 24-29 [sic]) knew, and had confirmed with Mr Modder from the DPP that the premise under which I was pulled over was fraudulent. These comments between himself and Mr Modder also put any ruling made by DCJ Bennett after these comments were made, as a ruling made in bad faith.”


	
	Later submissions identified the page to which reference was made as page 36 of the transcript. The hearing on 16 May opened with Mr Modder, appearing for the prosecution, noting that there were two matters in the list and that in relation to the applicant’s matter he would be seeking an adjournment. The judge responded:
	


“We might as well get rid of Woods now. I can have him brought up so it will save mentioning it later. Was there any luck with regard to the proposition that’s being advanced, either for or against either party, that is the suggestion that this was the sham so that they get hold of his vehicle?

MODDER: I believe there was involvement from another unit.”


	
	The matter had been before Bennett DCJ on two prior occasions; all that the passage in question demonstrated was that the judge recalled from the hearing two weeks earlier, that the applicant had made allegations of impropriety. There was no suggestion that Bennett DCJ knew, or accepted, that the allegations had substance. Indeed, the extract from the transcript indicated that he was enquiring as to whether there was or was not evidence of the sham that had been alleged. All that he was told was that there was some involvement from another unit, to which reference has been made in the passage already cited from Bennett DCJ’s reasons for judgment. [5] 
	
	
	On 22 May 2014, Sergeant Heywood gave evidence that he had received a phone call from another police officer before he intercepted the applicant’s vehicle.
	
	
	Not only did this material not demonstrate that the applicant was “pulled over” on a “fraudulent” basis, but it also failed to demonstrate that any such thing was “known” to the trial judge. The allegations of bias, making a decision for an improper purpose in bad faith and denying the applicant procedural fairness appear to have been based on the premise that the judge “knew” that the stopping of the vehicle was fraudulent. However, the factual premise was not made good.
	
	
	It follows that the challenge to the judgment in the District Court must be rejected. The Director did not seek costs. It is sufficient to order that the summons be dismissed.

		11 December 2015",2015-12-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2426795,Slater v R [2015] NSWCCA 310,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Appellant, Richard James Slater, was convicted following a trial before his Honour Judge Maiden SC and a jury at the Newcastle District Court of offences of aggravated break, enter and steal under s.112(2) Crimes Act 1900 (Count 2), being carried in a conveyance knowing it to have been taken without the owner’s consent contrary to s.154A(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 (Count 3) and five counts of obtaining property by deception contrary to s.192E(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 (Counts 4-8). Count 1, on which the Appellant was acquitted, was another allegation of aggravated breaking, entering and stealing.
	
	
	The Appellant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment for these offences.
	
	
	In written submissions provided to the Court for the purpose of the appeal, the Crown acknowledged that a number of errors and deficiencies were apparent from the trial. At the hearing of the appeal on 16 November 2015, the Crown joined with counsel for the Appellant in submitting that the appropriate course was to quash the convictions and enter verdicts of acquittal on each count.
	
	
	The Crown’s approach to the appeal was both fair and appropriate. The Court was satisfied that it should make orders as proposed by the parties. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court made the following orders:
	



	
	(1)   To the extent it is required, leave is granted to appeal against conviction.
	
	
	(2)   The appeal against conviction on Counts 2 to 8 is allowed.
	
	
	(3)   The convictions and sentences on Counts 2 to 8 are quashed.
	
	
	(4)   Verdicts of acquittal are entered on each of Counts 2 to 8.
	



	
	The Court indicated that it would provide reasons for these orders at a later time. What follows constitutes my reasons for joining in these orders.
	


The Crown Case Against the Appellant


	
	The Crown alleged that, on the evening of 4 November 2012, the Appellant broke and entered the home of a family at Merewether and stole a wallet and handbag. It was alleged that the Appellant and another male drove away in a silver motor vehicle owned by the occupants of that house. The Appellant was found not guilty by the jury of the s.112(2) Crimes Act 1900 charge relating to these premises (Count 1).
	
	
	In the early hours of 5 November 2012, a silver vehicle was used in a break and enter at an adult store at Sandgate and a quantity of synthetic drugs, some batteries and $1,000.00 in cash was stolen (Count 2). CCTV footage obtained from that store showed three offenders with covered faces getting out of the vehicle (Count 3). At one point during the CCTV footage, one of the men whom the Crown alleged at trial was the Appellant, returned to the vehicle, then exited with his face uncovered.
	
	
	Later on 5 November 2012, a credit card stolen from the wallet taken from the Merewether house was used to make four withdrawals from an ATM located at a hotel in Newcastle West. CCTV footage from that ATM showed three men at and around the vicinity of the ATM. One of the men, whom the Crown alleged at trial was the Appellant, was seen in the CCTV footage apparently using the hotel ATM for a period of approximately eight minutes (Counts 4, 5, 6 and 7).
	
	
	Later, still on 5 November 2012, the same credit card was used to purchase goods from a supermarket in Newcastle West. CCTV footage from the supermarket showed three men of similar appearance to the men seen in the hotel ATM footage conducting three separate transactions at the Coles Service Counter (Count 8).
	
	
	It is not necessary to set out in any further detail, the Crown case against the Appellant. Some further factual aspects will be touched upon when considering the grounds of appeal.
	


The Grounds of Appeal


	
	The Appellant relied upon on a number of grounds of appeal:
	



	
	Ground 1 - his Honour erred in failing to exclude evidence of CCTV footage and photographs of the commission of the aggravated break, enter and steal from the adult store on 5 November 2012 (Count 2).
	
	
	Ground 2 - his Honour failed to give reasons for allowing the evidence of CCTV footage and photographs of the commission of the aggravated break, enter and steal from the adult store on 5 November 2012 (Count 2).
	
	
	Ground 3 - his Honour failed to give any, or any adequate warnings to the jury as to the need to exercise caution in comparing the photographs of the Appellant to the person depicted in the CCTV footage and photographs of the commission of the aggravated break, enter and steal offence on the adult store on 5 November 2012 (Count 2).
	
	
	Ground 4 - the verdicts with respect to Counts 2 and 3 should be set aside on the ground that they are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
	
	
	Ground 5 - his Honour erred in failing to exclude evidence of CCTV footage and photographs taken from the hotel ATM at Newcastle West on 5 November 2012 (Counts 4, 5, 6 and 7).
	
	
	Ground 6 - his Honour erred in failing to exclude evidence of CCTV footage and photographs taken at the supermarket at Newcastle West on 5 November 2012 (Count 8).
	
	
	Ground 7 - his Honour failed to give reasons for allowing the evidence of CCTV footage and photographs from the hotel ATM on 5 November 2012 (Counts 4, 5, 6 and 7) and CCTV footage and photographs taken at the supermarket on 5 November 2012 (Count 8).
	
	
	Ground 8 - his Honour failed to give any, or any adequate warnings to the jury as to the need to exercise caution in comparing the photographs of the Appellant to the person depicted in the CCTV footage and photographs taken at the hotel ATM on 5 November 2012 (Counts 4, 5, 6 and 7) and the CCTV footage and photographs from the supermarket on 5 November 2012 (Count 8).
	
	
	Ground 9 - his Honour was in error in finding that there was a case to answer in respect of Counts 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. In the alternative, the verdicts of the jury should be set aside on the ground that they are unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
	
	
	Ground 10 - his Honour erred in prohibiting the jury from comparing the Appellant with the images of the offender (all counts).
	



	
	As the outcome with respect to a number of these grounds is determinative and leads to the quashing of the convictions and acquittal of the Appellant, it will not be necessary to address in any detail all of the grounds of appeal.
	


Ground 4 - Verdicts on Counts 2 and 3 Were Unreasonable and Not Supported by the Evidence


	
	It is appropriate to commence with this ground of appeal, which the Crown conceded had been made good. It remains necessary for the Court to satisfy itself that the ground has been established, although the Crown’s considered position is of great assistance to the Court.
	
	
	The Crown case was that heavily disguised offenders, one of whom was the Appellant, attended the adult store at Sandgate in the early hours of 5 November 2012, driving the silver motor vehicle which had been stolen from the Merewether premises the previous evening. Three males got out of the vehicle and tried to push open the front door of the store. Entry was gained by reversing the vehicle into the door several times. The fourth attempt resulted in the vehicle gaining entry. The offenders stole the items referred to at [7] above.
	
	
	The evidence relied upon by the Crown to establish the involvement of the Appellant was approximately four seconds of CCTV footage, wherein one of the offenders was seen without his mask. From this footage, two still photographs were extracted.
	
	
	In support of Count 3, the Crown relied upon the evidence concerning Count 2. The Crown alleged that the person seen in the CCTV footage and the still photographs was the Appellant, and that the motor vehicle was the silver motor vehicle stolen from the Merewether house some hours earlier.
	
	
	Ms Cox, counsel for the Appellant, submitted that there were a number of significant difficulties with this CCTV footage at the adult store, and the still photographs extracted from it. The Crown agreed that these criticisms were valid.
	
	
	According to the stilted CCTV footage, the three offenders (somewhat improbably) appeared to be wearing matching pink/lilac outfits, an indicator of colour distortion in the footage. The colours of clothing on the same people appeared differently later in the footage. It was accepted, in this Court, that distortions of this type would affect the reliability of the images of events at night time, including the depiction of facial features.
	
	
	The CCTV footage was blurry and indistinct. The image of the face (said to be the Appellant) suggested a pale skin colour, with eye colour not able to be determined. The face appeared long and thin and oval shaped, rather than round. These features were not consistent with the photographs of the Appellant taken upon his arrest on 21 November 2012, which the jury were asked to compare with the CCTV footage. In the arrest photographs, the Appellant’s skin is brown and was described as being of “Aboriginal appearance”. There were differences between the face depicted in the CCTV footage and in the arrest photographs.
	
	
	For the purpose of considering this ground of appeal, the Court has examined the relevant photographs. This examination confirms the criticisms made by counsel for the Appellant, which were accepted by the Crown.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the face of the man on the CCTV footage, in some respects, looked like the Appellant. That said, the Crown acknowledged that a vague similarity of that type could not suffice to support the conviction: Pitkin v The Queen [1995] HCA 30; 80 A Crim R 302. The Crown acknowledged that the face of the man in the CCTV footage appeared thinner than the Appellant and was not obviously Aboriginal.
	
	
	With respect to Count 3, the Crown acknowledged that the registration number of the silver motor vehicle was not visible in the CCTV footage. The Crown acknowledged that the time gap between the taking of the silver motor vehicle from the Merewether house and the aggravated break, enter and steal at the adult store in Sandgate was not sufficient proof that the silver motor vehicle in the CCTV footage was the vehicle stolen the previous evening. The Crown accepted that there was no evidence that the motor vehicle depicted in this CCTV footage was the stolen motor vehicle.
	
	
	The Crown case with respect to Counts 2 and 3 relied upon flawed CCTV footage and still photographs extracted from it. At its highest, that footage did not support a conviction of the Appellant upon Counts 2 and 3. The relevant principles may be found in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 and SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. I observe that the jury, in this case, was in no better position than this Court to consider the evidence, which was in the form of photographic evidence. I am satisfied that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the Appellant on Counts 2 and 3. The verdicts of guilty on Counts 2 and 3 were unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	In light of this conclusion, it is appropriate to quash each conviction and enter a verdict of acquittal on each count.
	


Grounds 1, 2, 3 and 10 - Other Suggested Errors Concerning Counts 2 and 3


	
	In view of the conclusion reached with respect to Ground 4, it is not necessary to determine each of these grounds of appeal. It is sufficient to observe that there were a number of troubling features surrounding the approach taken by the trial Judge to the admission of the CCTV footage and directions given to the jury on that topic.
	
	
	Having determined to admit the CCTV footage and photographs taken at the adult store, the trial Judge indicated that he would provide reasons later for that decision and that he would give the jury a direction as well on that topic at a later time (T5, 5 March 2014 - AB117).
	
	
	Regrettably, his Honour did not provide reasons for this decision during or after the trial. Evidence before this Court indicates that efforts were made by the Crown to contact the trial Judge in late October 2015 seeking his Honour’s reasons for this decision. His Honour’s Associate responded on 12 November 2015 stating that “His Honour no longer has a memory of giving his reasons and no longer has his notes in the matter”.
	
	
	As the parties to this appeal submitted, the trial Judge was obliged to give reasons for the admission of this evidence and his failure to give reasons constituted error: R v Harker [2004] NSWCCA 427 at [58]-[61].
	
	
	Although his Honour indicated that directions would be given to the jury with respect to the CCTV footage referable to Counts 2 and 3, the direction ultimately given to the jury was that they should only compare the CCTV footage (and still photographs extracted from it) with the photographs of the Appellant following his arrest on 21 November 2012. The jury was prohibited from comparing the photographs with the Appellant who had been sitting in court throughout the trial (Ground 10).
	
	
	Both parties submitted to this Court that this course was erroneous. No principle of law confined the jury to a comparison of the two sets of photographic images only. It was open to the jury, as judges of the fact, to take into account their own observations of the Appellant in court, to the extent that that may assist the resolution of this factual issue: Smith v The Queen [2001] HCA 50; 206 CLR 650 at 654-655 [9]-[11].
	
	
	That said, it was not submitted in this Court that an examination of the Appellant by the jury in court would have assisted the Crown case in any way. Indeed, the contrary seems to be the position.
	
	
	The matters complained of in Grounds 2, 3 and 10 have force. If Ground 4 had not been established, these grounds of appeal would themselves have warranted the intervention of this Court.
	


Ground 9 - No Case to Answer or Unreasonable Verdicts on Counts 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8


	
	The Crown case on Counts 4, 5, 6 and 7 was based upon CCTV footage showing three men at and around the vicinity of the hotel ATM at a particular time. One of the men, whom the Crown alleged at trial was the Appellant, is seen in the CCTV footage apparently using the hotel ATM for a period of about eight minutes.
	
	
	With respect to Count 8, the Crown case was based upon CCTV footage from the supermarket which showed three men. It was the Crown case that these were the same men as depicted in the CCTV footage from the hotel ATM.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was evidence that the stolen credit card was used on 5 November 2012 at the hotel ATM and later at the supermarket. However, the Crown acknowledged that there was no evidence to link the use of the card to the time when the man was seen at the hotel ATM or later when the card was used at the supermarket. In these circumstances, regardless of the probative value of the CCTV footage evidence, the Crown accepted that the case against the Appellant on Counts 4 to 8 was not made out.
	
	
	The Crown did not submit in this Court that there was a case to answer with respect to Counts 4 to 8 and submitted, in any event, that it was not open to the jury to convict the Appellant on Counts 4 to 8.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the Crown concession with respect to Counts 4 to 8 is sound. Upon proper examination of the evidence, at the least, the verdicts of guilty on Counts 4 to 8 were unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence (see [23] above).
	
	
	Accordingly, it is appropriate to quash the convictions on these counts and enter verdicts of acquittal.
	


Grounds 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 - Other Alleged Errors Concerning Counts 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8


	
	Once again, given the determinative significance of Ground 9 with respect to these counts, it is not necessary to dwell on other grounds challenging these convictions.
	
	
	The trial Judge stated that he would give reasons at a later time for allowing evidence of the CCTV footage at the hotel ATM and at the supermarket (Ground 7), which had been admitted by his Honour (Grounds 5 and 6). Once again, his Honour did not give reasons for this ruling at a later time. This constitutes error of the type found with respect to Ground 2 (see [28] above).
	
	
	With respect to Ground 8, his Honour once again directed the jury to confine consideration to a comparison of the different photographs and pieces of CCTV footage, with no comparison to be undertaken with the physical appearance of the Appellant in court. This was contrary to principle and inconsistent with the function of the jury as the judges of the fact (see [30] above).
	
	
	Given the decision with respect to Ground 9, it is not necessary to say more concerning the other grounds of appeal.
	


Conclusion


	
	It was for these reasons that I joined in the making of orders on 16 November 2015 as set out earlier in this judgment (at [4]).
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: I have read the judgment of Johnson J. His Honour has encapsulated my reasons for joining in the orders made on 16 November 2015.
	
	
	I had the opportunity to inspect the photographs and view the CCTV footage relied on by the Crown and referred to in Johnson J’ s judgment prior to the hearing of the appeal. It was immediately apparent from that inspection and viewing that the evidence relied on by the Crown was not capable of demonstrating that the particular offender alleged by the Crown to be the Applicant was in fact him. This was appropriately recognised by the Crown in its approach to this appeal.
	
	
	However the fact that the matter could have proceeded to trial much less conviction is deeply troubling. As best as I can ascertain the Applicant was in custody solely referable to the charges the subject of this appeal from at least 16 March 2014 until the entry of orders on 16 November 2015, that is 20 months. This incarceration was due to errors which were so obvious they simply should not have occurred.
	
	
	R S HULME AJ: I agree with the reasons of Johnson J. I also agree with the additional remarks of Beech-Jones J.

		08 December 2015",2015-12-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2427104,Fleet Partners Pty Limited v Roads and Maritime Services (NSW) [2016] NSWDC 17,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: On 20 November 2014, the RMS posted to the defendant a Court attendance notice requiring the appellant to appear before the Downing Centre Local Court on 13 January 2015 at 9.30am. The charge was that the defendant failed to inform, by statutory declaration within 21 days of the service of a penalty notice, of the name and address of a person in charge of a vehicle at the time of a designated offence. The date provided in the Court attendance notice for this offence was 20 September 2014. The designated offence was that: motor vehicle registered number LH1002 was detected as exceeding the speed limit by an approved speed measuring device and recorded by an approved camera recording device on the New England Highway at East Maitland on 17 August 2014. There was no dispute that the motor vehicle in question was, in fact, the property of the appellant at the relevant time.
	
	
	The penalty notice was posted to the defendant on 23 August 2014 and was deemed to have been served upon it on 30 August 2014. The maximum penalty for this offence is a fine of $11,000. The appellant pleaded guilty to the offence. On 7 July 2015, Richardson LCM sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court convicted the appellant but, pursuant to s 10A, imposed no further penalty. This is an appeal against severity of that sentence.
	
	
	It is important to bear in mind the circumstances in which the offence occurred. Paragraph 9 of the affidavit of Mr Ben Hutchinson, sworn 6 July 2015, says this:
	


""We note the following occurred in relation to the vehicle with the registration number LH1002 ('the vehicle'):

(a) Upon receipt of the subject infringement notice on or about 23 August 2014 (infringement notice), as per the General Practice the Customer Services Team at Fleet Partners performed a search of Fleet Partners' computer system with reference to the registration number of the vehicle being registration number LH1002.

(b) The search did not reveal any vehicle with that registration number.

(c) Subsequently, Fleet Partners received an enforcement order on or about 27 November 2014 (Enforcement Order).

(d) Upon receipt of the Enforcement Order, a further search of the computer system was conducted. That search revealed that Fleet Partners did in fact own the Vehicle.

(e) Following this, Fleet Partners undertook an investigation as to why upon receipt of the Infringement Notice, the Vehicle was not listed as a vehicle owned by Fleet Partners. Fleet Partners' investigations revealed that:

(i) On or about January 2014, Fleet Partners gave its consent for the individual [who drove the vehicle] to change the numberplates on Vehicle from IH1001. Fleet Partners was required to give the consent prior to a new registration number being allocated to the Vehicle. Accordingly, at the time that Fleet Partners gave its consent, it was not known what the new registration number of the Vehicle would be. As such, our client required the individual to notify our client of the new registration number of the Vehicle.

(ii) The individual subsequently changed the numberplates of the Vehicle to registration number LH1002 ('the New Registration Number').

(iii) On or about April 2014, the Fleet Partners' Customer Service Team requested details of the new registration number in relation to the Vehicle from the individual. One of the team members of the Vehicle Management Team received details of the new registration number. However, the new registration number was not entered into Fleet Partners' computer system.

(iv) On or about 11 November 2014, our client received registration papers for the Vehicle. A search of our client's computer system by reference to the new registration number did not reveal any vehicle owned or leased by our client. A further search of the VIN number on the registration papers revealed that the Vehicle was listed on our client's computer system as a vehicle [within] the registration system IH1001. Fleet Partners then called the individual who confirmed the new plates on the Vehicle had been changed from IH1001 to the new registration number.

(v) Fleet Partners, once the new registration number was known, allocated the Infringement Notice and Enforcement Order to the individual. The individual accepted responsibility for the Infringement Notice and the Enforcement Order and paid the penalty amount.""


	
	It can be seen that the effective reason that the appellant did not advise RMS of the identity of the driver of the vehicle is because the new registration number had not been entered into the appellant's computer system on or shortly after the appellant's Customer Service Team received details that the vehicle formerly identified as IH1001 was now known as LH1002. There was a human error, it would appear, in the Customer Service Team. Nothing has been lost because the Enforcement Order was paid by the actual driver who accepted responsibility for the original offence and, no doubt, has “worn” any other consequence such as the loss of points.
	
	
	The same affidavit and a further affidavit of Mr Hutchinson, sworn 2 February 2016, established that since this ""hiccough"" occurred, systems have been changed and the offence for which the appellant was convicted could no longer occur. For example, the appellant now receives a report from the registration authority every 48 hours, known as ""the Registration Checker"", which enables the defendant to ensure that vehicles registered to it with the registration authority are properly recorded on the defendant's computer system. An SMS reminder system has now been put into place which notifies drivers listed on the defendant's computer system when an Infringement Notice is received in respect of a vehicle. The appellant now also accesses the RMS electronic nomination system on a daily basis to check outstanding penalty notices which may have been given to the appellant. The ""hiccough"" that occurred in the present matter ought not now occur as far as human knowledge is currently aware.
	
	
	The appellant is a national fleet leasing and management company. At the relevant time, it managed, financed or owned approximately 35,000 cars in Australia of which at the current time 10,500 vehicles, approximately, are registered in this State. The appellant has been operating for almost 19 years. I am told without demur from the Bar table that the appellant has always been a substantial operator in the area of managing a national motor vehicle fleet. During its 19 years of operation in this State, the appellant has incurred no prior conviction.
	
	
	Exhibit 2 before me is a record of penalty infringement notices incurred by the appellant for offences commencing on 1 June 2014. The printout was made on 17 November 2014 and concludes with an offence alleged to be committed on 12 November 2014. The report is 25 pages long and shows about 220 matters, perhaps closer to 240 matters. Most of those are parking offences. The defendant paid a traffic infringement notice. The records indicate the imposition of the traffic infringement notice for an offence occurring on 14 June 2014 which was the offence of failing to nominate within the timeframe specified. The only other offence which might be thought to be relevant was an offence of exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 kilometres per hour but less than 20 kilometres an hour on 28 October 2014 for which a traffic Infringement Notice was sent to the defendant.
	
	
	However, assuming the defendant paid those traffic infringement notices for one reason or another, the payment of the traffic Infringement Notice is not any admission of any criminal offence. Accordingly, the appellant came before the Local Court and comes before this Court as a corporation of prior good character, having no earlier criminal conviction and for almost 19 years managing a large fleet of motor vehicles driven by a large number of person, no doubt from many States, on the roads of this State. One hiccough has occurred.
	
	
	The defendant seeks to maintain its record to avoid a conviction in the circumstances here present because the offence was due to human clerical oversight and nothing was lost in that the real offender, the person who was driving the motor vehicle on the New England Highway at East Maitland, took responsibility for the fine and any necessary points that he or she might incur against his or her licence. I note that the vehicle was detected as being driven at 71 kilometres per hour in a 60 kilometre per hour zone at 8.34am which, as far as speeding offences are concerned, is itself towards the bottom of the range. The photographs taken by the speed camera suggest that the offence occurred not in a built-up area but in an area where the highway is surrounded by natural bush.
	
	
	Any person who for 19 years did what this defendant did and incurred no prior conviction is certainly entitled to the Court exercising its discretion under s 10. I see no point in the defendant incurring a conviction and having its reputation ""sullied"" which could rebound to its commercial disadvantage.
	
	
	For those reasons, I set aside the conviction passed by the Downing Centre Local Court on 7 July 2015. Without proceeding to a conviction, having regard to the good character of the appellant, I am satisfied that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment. I order that the charge be dismissed.

2427153,Ibrahim v R [2016] NSWCCA 6,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: I agree with the orders proposed by Bellew J and generally with his reasons.
	
	
	The relative weight to be given to general deterrence and subjective circumstances will depend on the offence and the offender. This is part of the intuitive synthesis required in considering all of the purposes of sentencing.
	
	
	BELLEW J: On 12 June 2013 Hanan Mohamad Ibrahim (“the applicant”) was jointly arraigned with her brother, Nazih Mohamad Ibrahim, and pleaded not guilty to the following offences:
	



	
	between about 1 February 2011 and 18 March 2011, in the State of New South Wales, did attempt to commit an offence against subsection 307.5(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) in that she did attempt to possess a substance, the substance being an unlawfully imported border controlled drug, namely opium, the quantity being a commercial quantity (count 1); and
	
	
	on or about 18 March 2011 at Guildford in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug namely opium, the quantity being an amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug (count 2).
	



	
	On the seventh day of the joint trial, the applicant pleaded guilty to count 1. The Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. In addition, and pursuant to s. 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (“the Act”), the applicant agreed to have taken into account on sentence an offence of possessing a controlled drug, namely Opium.
	
	
	The offending in count 1 was contrary to ss. 307.5 and 11.1 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth.). It carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
	
	
	On 17 October 2014, following sentence proceedings which extended over a period of more than one year, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years and 6 months to date from 17 March 2011, and to expire on 16 September 2023. A non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months was set, to date from 17 March 2011 and to expire on 16 September 2018.
	
	
	By notice dated 30 June 2015 the applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the grounds that:
	



	
	the sentencing judge erred by failing to have proper regard to her mental health in a principled fashion; and
	
	
	the sentence is manifestly excessive.
	


THE FACTS


	
	The following statement of facts was tendered by the Crown on sentence:
	


A. The Consignment

1. On 3 February 2011, sea cargo consignment bearing original bill of lading number MSCUIR191603 consisting of a 20 foot shipping container numbered TOLU2483506 (“the container”) departed Bandara Abbas, Iran on board the ship MSC BASEL. The container purported to contain “foodstuff including tomato paste and fruit juice and carpet and travertine stone in 970 packages”. The details of the consignor and consignee were as follows:

Consignee:

METAL FAB-ABN: 91 368 610 282

Unit 22/ 23-35 Scrivener Street

Warwick Farm NSW 2170

AUSTRALIA

Phone: 98222340   Fax: 0417022246

Consignor:

MEHDI MAHMOUDI

TEHRAN IRAN

BANDAR ABBAS

IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF

2. On 10 March 2011, the container arrived in Port Botany, Sydney, and was subsequently unloaded into bond pending customs clearance.

3. On 14 March 2011, Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs) and the Australian Federal Police (‘AFP’) examined the container at the Customs Container Examination Facility and found it to contain:

a) 36 pallets of boxes containing household items including pots, pans, dinnerware and cushions;

b) 17 rugs wrapped in printed plastic wrap and 668 boxes of foodstuffs; and

c) 19 cardboard boxes, each of which was marked on the exterior with two blue arrows, which had contents that were inconsistent with the description on their factory labels (“the consignment”).

4. Upon examination of the 19 cardboard boxes each was found to contain:

a) two ‘A4’ pieces of paper printed with a religious image depicting 3 people, a lion and Arabic text which lined the top and base of each box;

b) 12 clear glass jars with a white metal screw lid. There were 228 glass jars in total. Affixed to each jar was a label printed in part in Arabic characters and an image depicting tomatoes. Ingredients were listed as ‘98% tomato juice’.

5. On 15 March 2011, AFP Crime Scene members conducted a forensic examination of the 228 glass jars. Each jar was found to contain between 675.3 grams and 779.8 grams of opium, totalling between 175,217.6 grams (175.2 kilograms) and 176,822.2 grams (176.8 kilograms) of opium.

6. The wholesale value of the opium seizure is between $3,241,200 and $3,270,800. This value is calculated on a figure of $18,500 per kilogram for wholesale sales of opium in NSW in March 2011.

7. The street value of the opium seizure is between $5,256,528 and $5,304,666. This value is calculated on a figure of $30 per gram for street sales of opium in NSW in March 2011.

8. Subsequent fingerprint examination by AFP Crime Scene members of the original jars consigned from Iran revealed a number of latent fingerprints. A number of these fingerprints located on 6 different original jars were identified as being consistent with those of the co-offender, Majed SAFIZADEH (“SAFIZADEH”).

B Controlled operation

9. On 15 March 2011, a Controlled Operation Authority was issued to facilitate the delivery of the consignment by AFP members and the freight forwarder.

10. Between 15 and 16 March 2011, AFP Crime Scene members completed a substitution of the original 228 jars with jars containing an inert substitute material. The AFP installed optical, listening and tracking devices on the consignment and commenced lawful interception of telecommunications service 0417 022 246, which was one of the telephone numbers recorded by the freight forwarding agent United Cargo, as a contact number for the consignee, Metal Fab..

11. Police identified Nazih Mohamad IBRAHIM (N IBRAHIM) born 23 April 1975 as the sole user of this telecommunications service.

12. Police identified that N IBRAHIM operated a metal fabrication business named Metal Fab at 22/23-35 Scrivener Street, Warwick Farm, the consignee’s address shown on the Bill of Lading.    

C Conduct of the Offenders before Delivery of the Consignment

13. On 1 November 2010, SAFIZADEH departed Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport on Emirates flight 413 to Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

14. On 15 February 2011, SAFIZADEH arrived at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport on Emirates flight 412 from Dubai, United Arab Emirates having been out of Australia between 1 November 2010 and 15 February 2011.

15. In February 2011, Joseph Rizk of United Cargo received a telephone call from a male person who identified himself as ‘Nazih’ who stated that he had a shipment coming in and wanted to arrange Customs clearance and delivery of his cargo. Rizk informed him that he needed to come into the office and provide him with relevant documents. Three or four days later, N IBRAHIM went into the office with original copies of the Iranian Health and Human Consumption Ability Certificate and original copies of the Certificate of Origin issued in Iran. Rizk advised N IBRAHIM that he needed to provide a bill of lading, commercial invoice and a packing declaration.

16. About two weeks later, N IBRAHIM returned to the United Cargo office with the original Bill of Lading MSCUIR191603 which related to the consignment.

17. On or about 8 March 2011, N IBRAHIM signed a written authority to Mediterranean Shipping Company Australia authorising United Cargo to act on behalf of his company, Metal Fab, in effecting the delivery of the consignment.

18. On or about 10 March 2011, N IBRAHIM attended the United Cargo Office and was provided with an invoice for payment. He paid $3,300 in cash for freight forwarding the shipment and a copy of the invoice was provided to N IBRAHIM in a United Cargo pink and blue folder.

19. On 15 March 2011, police drove past 22/23-35 Scrivener Street, Warwick Farm. This unit and adjoining units had been significantly damaged by fire and a barrier was set up to prevent entry into the fire damaged units.

20. Throughout 15 March 2011, N IBRAHIM was heard in several conversations with Ahmed Jebara. N IBRAHIM and Ahmed Jebara discussed the leasing of another unit in the complex, unit 11, due to the fire damage in unit 22. N IBRAHIM agreed to lease unit 11 for $1,600 per month.

D The events of 16 March 2011

21. About 11:03am on 16 March 2011, SAFIZADEH telephoned N IBRAHIM and asked if he had “called these people”. N IBRAHIM replied he had called them and “there is nothing yet”. SAFIZADEH asked whether he called them in the morning and N IBRAHIM said he called about half an hour ago.

22. About 11:51am on 16 March 2011, the offender Hanan Mohamad IBRAHIM (“H IBRAHIM”), the sister of N IBRAHIM, using telecommunications service 0448846059, telephoned N IBRAHIM and discussed the damage caused by the fire. N IBRAHIM then said “Ok we called in regards to the box and there is nothing yet” to which H IBRAHIM replied, “Stuff them, stuff them”. 

23. About 11:59am on 16 March 2011, N IBRAHIM contacted United Cargo and requested an update on the status of the container for Metal Fab. United Cargo informed N IBRAHIM that the container was still being held.

24. About 12:23pm on 16 March 2011, SAFIZADEH telephoned N IBRAHIM and had the following conversation:

SAFIZADEH:   “Have you called again or haven’t you called?

N IBRAHIM:       “Of course I called”

SAFIZADEH:   “Nothing?”

N IBRAHIM:   “Nothing”

SAFIZADEH:   “What are you going to do now are you going to ring now or later?”

N IBRAHIM:   “Hajji I swear to God that I just called ten minutes ago”

SAFIZADEH:    “Don’t you, don’t you know why there isn’t anything?”

N IBRAHIM:   “Nothing, they’re telling me it’s being held, they haven’t released it, they haven’t released it yet”

SAFIZADEH:   “That’s alright! (ind)??

N IBRAHIM:    “Do you mean you want me ring them every five minutes?

SAFIZADEH:   “No I’m telling you will you come to my place now or after?”

N IBRAHIM:      “After”

SAFIZADEH:   “Ok”

25. About 2:12pm on 16 March 2011, SAFIZADEH telephoned N IBRAHIM and requested a status update on the container. They had the following conversation:

SAFIZADEH:   “Have you called or haven’t you called yet?”

N IBRAHIM:   “No I won’t call anymore”

SAFIZADEH:   “Huh?”

N IBRAHIM:   “I will not call again that’s it”

SAFIZADEH:   “Who is going to call then?

N IBRAHIM:   “They will call us when they have something”

…

SAFIZADEH:   “Give them a call”

N IBRAHIM:   “Hajji believe me they will call us on their own”

SAFIZADEH:   “If you don’t call now you will have to call at 3 o’clock God willing

N IBRAHIM:   “I will not call again”

SAFIZADEH:   “It’s not up to you to call or not”

N IBRAHIM:   “If you want me to I will call but if it were up to me, I won’t call”

SAFIZADEH:   “Ok I’ll call you at 3 o’clock to call”

N IBRAHIM:   “Not a problem ok bye”

26. About 2:58pm on 16 March 2011, SAFIZADEH telephoned N IBRAHIM and had the following conversation:

N IBRAHIM:   “What do you want my dear?

SAFIZADEH:   “Please, give them a call”

N IBRAHIM:   “I rang I swear to God I called. I’m not waiting for you to tell me to call? I called at quarter to three.

SAFIZADEH:   “Huh?”

N IBRAHIM:   “I rang at quarter to three not at three”

SAFIZADEH:    “Ah ok”

N IBRAHIM:   “There is nothing”

SAFIZADEH:   “Ok”

N IBRAHIM:   “I will call again at 4:30”.

27. There is no record of N IBRAHIM contacting United Cargo at quarter to three as indicated by N IBRAHIM to SAFIZADEH in that telephone call.

28. About 4:34pm on 16 March 2011, N IBRAHIM contacted a female using telecommunications service 0421638310.

j) 1 Vodafone SIM card for telecommunications service 0424649022 subscribed to Daniel Byrne of 1304/93 Macdonald St Erskineville NSW 2043, activated on 11 March 2009 and disconnected on 12 November 2010. This is a false identity.

89. AFP Crime Scene members conducted a forensic examination of the 2 jars seized from H IBRAHIM’s premises. The first jar contained 1057.8 grams of opium and the second jar contained 432.5 grams of opium with a total of 1,490.3 grams. 

K IBRAHIM’s Record of Interview

90. On 20 September 2011, N IBRAHIM participated in a record of interview after being cautioned. In this record of interview, N IBRAHIM stated the following:

a) he did not know that the substance was a drug and he had no sense of smell so he could not smell drugs. SAFIZADEH told him it was not illegal;

b) SAFIZADEH told him it was ‘teriak’ which in their language means a medicine made of herbal extract that can be eaten or smoked. He only found out in gaol that they can make heroin out of opium;

c) SAFIZADEH used N IBRAHIM’s name for the importations because SAFIZADEH was a pensioner;

d) he started helping SAFIZADEH by giving people he met in SAFIZADEH’s shed the “herb” and they would pay him money in return. When SAFIZADEH went overseas, he would leave the “herb” with N IBRAHIM. The diary seized from N IBRAHIM’s house is his diary and contains the record of the transactions he made on behalf of SAFIZADEH;

e) the number 500 in a circle in the diary stands for 500 grams which was worth $9,500;

f) the price of a 1 kilogram was $19,000 and the price was set by SAFIZADEH;

g) when shown the photographs of the jars containing granulated material seized at H IBRAHIM’s house and photographs of the Icy machine, N IBRAHIM confirmed that the icy machine was used to granulate the rock when it needed to be broken up;

h) the record of money transactions in the diary is a record of the money he paid to SAFIZADEH. N IBRAHIM would give the money to either SAFIZADEH’s son-in-law Samir, SAFIZADEH’s daughter, Alaa, or he would deposit straight into SAFIZADEH’s mortgage bank account;

i) SAFIZADEH would set the price of the opium before he went overseas, ‘they’ would ring him and he would either go to their houses or meet in front of SAFIZADEH’s house;

j) he was surprised to see the jars in his bedroom before he was arrested. When H IBRAHIM and SAFIZADEH left the container, N IBRAHIM thought they were going to SAFIZADEH’s place, and N IBRAHIM stayed behind to handle the container;

k) SAFIZADEH never mentioned that the “medicine” was in tomato paste jars, N IBRAHIM never saw them in that;

l) he has taken the opium to Melbourne for a man named Shamshir; and

m) he did not take money for the work he did for SAFIZADEH.

L Statement to Police by SAFIZADEH

91. On 5 October 2012, SAFIZADEH provided a statement to police under caution in which he stated the following:

a) when he arrived at N IBRAHIM’s factory unit he confirmed to N IBRAHIM that the boxes were the boxes containing the opium;

b) when they arrived at N IBRAHIM’s house, they unpacked the car and took the 19 boxes into N IBRAHIM’s bedroom. H IBRAHIM and he opened one or two boxes containing the opium. He hastily opened one of the jars and realised that the content of the jars was not opium; and

c) when SAFIZADEH called Mehdi in Iran, he confirmed that nothing had changed and it was not the first time he had sent a container and it was impossible for it to have changed. He stated it was he who called Mehdi since N IBRAHIM had not arrived at the house at that time.


	
	Annexure “A” to the statement of facts (referred to at para. 71) was a transcript of conversations recorded by way of a listening device. I have not set out the entirety of the contents of that transcript, but have set out relevant excerpts when considering ground 2.
	


THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL

GROUND 1 – THE SENTENCING JUDGE ERRED BY FAILING TO HAVE PROPER REGARD TO THE APPLICANT’S MENTAL HEALTH IN A PRINCIPLED FASHION

The evidence


	
	In the proceedings before the sentencing judge, counsel then appearing for the applicant tendered (with the consent of the Crown) a report of Michelle Player, Clinical Psychologist, dated 12 September 2013.
	
	
	At [19] of her report, Ms Player noted that the applicant’s history that she had been prescribed medications “to manage her diabetes, hypertension and cholesterol”. At [22] Ms Player stated:
	


“I understand from Ms Ibrahim and her GP medical records that she consulted with her GP and reported experiencing depressive symptoms in November 2007 (following the birth of her fourth son). Based on medical records, it appears that she was prescribed anti-depressant medications from around March 2009 and that she began consulting with a psychologist, Mr Medhat Metry, from August 2008 under a Mental Health Care Plan. Ms Ibrahim spoke positively of her contact with her psychologist; offering that she used the sessions to begin resolving grief issues and related stressors regarding ‘my babies, my life, my son, we don’t have the best life’. She indicated that she last saw him about one month prior to her remand in custody. She also expressed her willingness to renew contact with Mr Metry upon her release from gaol in order to receive psychological support with this transition”.


	
	The medical records of the applicant’s general practitioner to which Ms Player referred were not in evidence before the sentencing judge.
	
	
	At [26] of her report Ms Player noted the applicant’s reported symptoms related to unresolved trauma stress. The applicant described having nightmares, although she did not provide specific details about them. Ms Player thought that the history provided by the applicant in this regard was indicative of her experiencing symptoms of stress relating to prior traumatic events, the details of which the applicant had been reluctant to disclose.
	
	
	In reviewing the documentation provided to her, Ms Player noted (at [27] of her report) that the applicant had come under the care of a Ms Weinstein, Psychologist, who had provided her with supportive counselling for panic attacks. She also noted that an initial referral of the applicant to Dr Elliott, Psychiatrist in 2011, but that no medication or follow-up was deemed necessary. It was noted by Ms Player (at [27]) that Ms Weinstein had reported that the applicant appeared to be suffering from anxiety, trauma and unresolved grief issues that were affecting her sleep and well-being. Ms Player further noted (at [28]) that the applicant had been referred to a Psychiatrist in May 2013 whilst in custody, and that the referral detailed the applicant’s lack of ability to cope with custody, her unresolved legal matters and her unresolved history of prior trauma and anxiety. There were references to possible depression and post traumatic stress disorder.
	
	
	Ms Player undertook psychometric testing of the applicant. She said (at [38]) that the results revealed that the applicant had extremely low cognitive functioning. She concluded that the applicant presented as an intellectually disabled woman who satisfied the criteria for mild mental retardation.
	
	
	Ms Player (at [39]) described the applicant’s account of her involvement in the offending as “unsophisticated” and said that it “reflected a level of naïvety commensurate with her presentation in interview, as well as with her low intellectual capacity”. Ms. Player’s categorisation of the applicant’s offending as unsophisticated and naïve was obviously based, in large part, upon the history provided by the applicant. In particular, Ms Player did not have available to her the evidence of statements made by the applicant in the course of her offending, which were recorded by a listening device and which I have discussed further below in my consideration of ground 2.
	
	
	Ms Player went on to state (at [42]):
	


“Specifically, Ms Ibrahim satisfies criteria for Mild Mental Retardation … Ms Ibrahim’s involvement in the current offending seems best understood in the context of her extremely low intellectual capacity and poor life management skills. It appears that she was naïve, and placed her trust in her brother and co-offenders, agreeing to assist them in their endeavour at their behest, whilst not being fully cognizant of the ramifications of her involvement. She does not present with inherent antisocial attitudes, she condemned her offences and she expressed seemingly genuine remorse for her crime. Providing her with suitable services in the community to support her psychological and intellectual vulnerabilities will assist in moderating her recidivism risk”.

The sentence proceedings


	
	Although the applicant entered a plea of guilty on 24 June 2013, it was not until 17 October 2014 that sentence was actually imposed. The matter came before the sentencing judge on six separate occasions in the intervening period. Ms Player’s report was tendered on the second of those occasions, namely 15 November 2013.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings and was cross-examined at length by the Crown. In terms of her mental state, the applicant told the sentencing judge (commencing at T14 L29) that she was taking medication for “depression”. The applicant gave no further evidence in respect of that issue. She did not assert that she had difficulty obtaining appropriate medical treatment, nor did she assert that her period in custody was being rendered more difficult as a consequence of any mental health issue.
	
	
	Counsel then appearing for the applicant provided written submissions to the sentencing judge. Those submissions contained only two references to the report of Ms Player, in the following terms:
	


(3)   The offender gave evidence that she was truthful with psychologist Michelle Player.

…

(5)   Having regard to Ms Player’s report, it appears the offender has suffered depression since 2007, is psychologically vulnerable, naïve, takes medication for diabetes, hypertension and cholesterol and without being disrespectful is of low intelligence. It is submitted these are relevant factors to the sentencing process (s 16A(2)(m).       


	
	The reference to s. 16A(2)(m) was a reference to s. 16A(2)(m) of the Act which required the sentencing judge to take into account (inter alia) the mental condition of the applicant.
	
	
	No oral submissions were put to the sentencing judge based upon Ms Player’s report. It was not put to the sentencing judge that there was any causal connection between the applicant’s mental state and her offending, such that her moral culpability for the offending ought be lessened. Further, it was not put that the applicant’s mental state rendered her an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. Finally, it was not put that the applicant’s mental state rendered her conditions of custody more onerous.
	


The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	The sentencing judge (commencing at ROS 11) assessed the applicant’s subjective circumstances. In doing so, her Honour referred to the fact that the applicant had given evidence. She also referred to the tender of Ms Player’s report. Drawing on that material, her Honour outlined the applicant’s background before saying (at ROS 13):
	


“She has type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure for which she has received treatment in the community and also in custody. She has been working while on remand and is a trusted prisoner. She said in evidence that she would like to obtain work in the community on her release”.


	
	Her Honour made no further reference to the applicant’s physical or mental health.
	


Submissions of the applicant


	
	Counsel for the applicant drew attention to s 16A(2)(m) of the Act and submitted that there was evidence of the applicant’s mental condition contained in the report of Ms Player. Counsel acknowledged that there had been (as he described it) “minimal reference” to the applicant’s mental state in evidence, argument and submissions before the sentencing judge. However, he submitted that notwithstanding the “lack of assistance” provided to the sentencing judge by the applicant’s then counsel, it remained the case that Ms Player’s report had been tendered in evidence. It was submitted that the failure on the part of the sentencing judge to give that report proper consideration was an error, as a consequence of which the applicant had been denied consideration of principles which applied to the sentencing of mentally ill offenders.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown acknowledged the existence of the principles regarding the sentencing of mentally ill offenders upon which the applicant now sought to rely. However, the Crown submitted that in the present case the report of Ms Player did not establish any causal connection between the applicant’s mental state and her offending. It was submitted that in these circumstances, there was no basis upon which the applicant’s moral culpability for the offending should have been lessened.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the report of Ms Player did not support any moderation of the need for general deterrence, nor did it support a conclusion that the state of the applicant’s mental health was such that a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily upon her.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances, the Crown submitted that ground 1 was not made out.
	


Consideration


	
	The principles applicable to the sentencing of mentally ill offenders were outlined by McClellan CJ at CL in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 commencing at [177]. Those principles include the following:
	



	
	where the state of an offender’s mental health contributes to the commission of an offence in a material way, his or her moral culpability may be reduced;
	
	
	as a consequence of the matter in (a), the need to denounce the crime may be lessened and reflected in a reduction in the sentence;
	
	
	the state of an offender’s mental health may also have the consequence that he or she is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence, resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed;
	
	
	an offender’s mental health may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on him or her and accordingly, because the sentence will be more onerous, the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be more severe; and
	
	
	an offender’s mental illness may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence.
	



	
	The fact that no submission was made to the sentencing judge that all or any of these principles were relevant to sentence presents the applicant with a difficulty before this court.
	
	
	In Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) said (commencing at [79], citations omitted):
	


“[79]   This court is a court of error. The jurisdiction of the court to interfere with a sentencing decision is exercisable only where there can be seen to have been an error of principle, or some other mistake of fact or law. If material error is demonstrated, before the court would proceed to resentence the Applicant, the court must form a positive opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. It is, of course, a basic principle that, absent error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge merely because (if it be the case) the court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his or her discretion

[80]   There is a practical expectation that an offender’s legal representative will make submissions to the sentencing Judge at first instance, by reference to the particular factors which are sought to be taken into account in mitigation of sentence in the case at hand. … “


	
	Previously, in Romero v R [2011] VSCA 45; (2011) 32 VR 486 Redlich JA had said (at [11]):
	


“In sentencing appeals, this court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment. It is not a rehearing of the plea in mitigation. It is not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below. Given the nature of its supervisory role, this court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been, but were not advanced on the plea”.


	
	More recently in Dicianni v R; Pintabona v R [2015] NSWCCA 201 Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Price and Davies JJ agreed) observed (at [282]):
	


“It is difficult to see how there can be said to be error by the Sentencing Judge’s failing to take matters into account when no submissions about those matters were made. This court has made clear in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [75] to [81], that ordinarily, if a matter has not been put to the Sentencing Judge, this court will be unlikely to find error by reason of the matter not being referred to in the remarks on sentence unless some serious injustice can be shown from the failure to raise the matter in the court below”.


	
	It is evident from the transcript of the sentence proceedings, and from the submissions made on behalf of the applicant to the sentencing judge, that the report of Ms Player assumed little or no significance in the applicant’s case. This is reflected by the fact that the submissions which were made in relation to it were limited to those in [20] above.
	
	
	Ms Player did not suggest that the applicant’s mental state was causally connected to her offending. Accordingly, the applicant’s mental state did not provide any basis for a lessening of her moral culpability. Even accepting that evidence of an offender’s mental state can remain relevant in the absence of such a causal connection, and allowing for the fact that Ms Player diagnosed the applicant as suffering from mild mental retardation, the evidence did not support a conclusion that the applicant was an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence, particularly in light of the conduct which constituted the offending, and to which I have referred in more detail below when considering ground 2.
	
	
	Further, there was no evidence that the applicant’s mental state rendered her period of custody more onerous. The general tenor of the evidence was that the applicant was being appropriately treated with medication.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances, it is unsurprising that no submission was put to the sentencing judge that the principles governing the sentencing of mentally ill offenders were applicable. The question of the applicant’s mental health assumed no real significance at the time. There was no error on the part of the sentencing judge in failing to consider submissions which were not put to her. The evidence did not support the application of the principles set out in De La Rosa in any event. Accordingly, no injustice of the kind referred to by Hoeben CJ at CL in Dicianni has been established.
	
	
	It follows that this ground is not made out.
	


GROUND 2 – THE SENTENCE IS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE

Submissions of the applicant


	
	In advancing this ground, counsel for the applicant relied upon a number of factors.
	
	
	Firstly, it was submitted that although the sentencing judge was not satisfied that there had not been other breaches of the law on the part of the applicant, this was a case in which the applicant had no record of prior offending. It was submitted that in these circumstances she was to be regarded as a person of good character.
	
	
	Secondly, counsel pointed to the applicant’s general subjective circumstances, particularly her personal background. He described aspects of that background as “monstrously sad” and pointed, in particular, to the fact that of the four children the applicant had delivered, only one (who is now a teenager) remained alive. Whilst it was not suggested that the effect of the applicant’s incarceration upon her family was exceptional, it was submitted that it was nevertheless a relevant factor on sentence, and that insufficient weight had been given to it (and to the other factors relied upon) by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Thirdly, it was submitted that the applicant’s criminality was low when compared to that of her co-offenders, and that her actions were generally unsophisticated.
	
	
	Fourthly, it was submitted that the applicant’s mental state had the effect of reducing her moral culpability for the offending. It was further submitted that even if this were not the case, Ms Player’s opinion that the applicant suffered from mild mental retardation was necessarily a relevant subjective consideration.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown generally acknowledged the circumstances of the applicant’s background. However, the Crown emphasised what was described as the applicant’s “conscious, intelligent and knowing participation” in the importation. In this regard, the Crown took the court to a number of statements made by the applicant which were recorded by listening device and which, in the Crown’s submission, were demonstrative of the role that she had played.
	
	
	The Crown took issue with the opinion of Ms Player that the applicant’s offending was naïve. It was submitted that such opinion was at odds not only with the evidence of the recorded statements of the applicant, but with aspects of her evidence before the sentencing judge. It was submitted that the evidence established that in acting as she did, the applicant was fully conscious of her conduct.
	
	
	The Crown also pointed to the weight of the drug which was imported. Whilst acknowledging that weight was not a determinative factor, the Crown submitted that it was necessarily relevant in determining sentence. The Crown also submitted that general deterrence was an important consideration.
	
	
	Finally the Crown submitted that the applicant performed a significant role in a sophisticated operation of importing prohibited drugs and that taking into account all of the relevant circumstances, the sentence which had been imposed was not one that could be described as unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	


Consideration


	
	The applicant’s subjective circumstances were set out in the report of Ms Player (commencing at [7]). There is no doubt that aspects of the applicant’s background attract considerable sympathy. However, it is clear from the sentencing remarks (commencing at ROS 11) that the sentencing judge took those matters into account. It is also important to bear in mind that the weight to be given to an offender’s subjective circumstances must not be such as to lead to the imposition of a sentence which is disproportionate to the objective seriousness of the offending. Subjective considerations, however persuasive, are necessarily subsidiary to the duty of the courts to impose a sentence which will operate as a powerful factor in preventing the commission of similar offences by others: R v Todd (NSWCCA unreported, 7 February 1994) per Hunt CJ at CL (McInerney and Sully JJ agreeing). General deterrence is a particularly important consideration in sentencing for offending of this nature: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v El Kaharni (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 at 377 per the Court; R v Riddell [2009] NSWCCA 96; (2009) 194 A Crim R 524 at [55] – [58] per Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) (Blanch and Howie JJ agreeing).
	
	
	The weight of the prohibited drug which was imported was almost nine times the applicable commercial quantity. On any view, that was significant. Weight is not determinative of sentence, nor is it determinative of a range into which a sentence should fall: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [68]-[69] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ; De La Rosa (supra) at [68] per Allsop P (as his Honour then was). However, it is clearly a relevant factor: R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238; (2010) 205 A Crim R 106 at [72] per Johnson J (Macfarlan JA and R A Hulme J agreeing).
	
	
	Moreover, the relevance of the weight of the prohibited drug becomes greater where it is a matter within the knowledge of the offender: Nguyen (supra) at [72]; Garcia v R [2013] NSWCCA 241 at [74] per Bellew J (Emmett JA and R A Hulme J agreeing). Whilst there is no evidence in the present case that the applicant had precise knowledge of the weight of the drug which was imported, the nature and extent of her involvement in the venture was such that she must, at the very least, have known that it was substantial.
	
	
	Merely because the applicant’s role may have been less than that played by one or other of her co-offenders does not mean that it was a minor one. In assessing that role, the applicant’s actions, and the statements she made in carrying them out, are significant.
	
	
	The evidence before the sentencing judge established that the applicant assisted in loading the 19 boxes into the rear of her vehicle which she then drove, in convoy with Safizadeh, to the address at which they were unpacked. The applicant and Safizadeh were clearly aware of the need to conduct themselves in a way which did not draw undue attention to their activities. So much is evident from the recorded conversation between them which is set out at para. 68 of the statement of facts.
	
	
	In the course of the boxes being opened, the following was recorded (“S” being a reference, in each case, to words said by Safizadeh):
	


S: (Unintelligible) … what …what is this?..Fuck

Applicant: (Unintelligible)… now, is something wrong?

S: Open the other one.

Applicant: Is something wrong with it? I will bring a knife.


	
	Subsequently, when the applicant had been told by Safizadeh that the “material had been changed”, the following was recorded:
	


Applicant: Do you mean it has nothing to do with the matter at all?

S: No.

Applicant: Huh?

S: No.


	
	Upon discovering that the drugs had been substituted, the applicant said to Safizadeh:
	


You have been tricked over there Abu Ali; you have been tricked over there.


	
	The applicant then queried whether Safizadeh had “packed it with his own hands” before the following was said:
	


S: (Unintelligible).. Not a single one all of them… (Interrupted)

Applicant: The nineteen?

S: All of them, when (unintelligible) placed; it’s obvious that the container has been tampered with.

Applicant: Maybe it has been tampered with over there.

S: No, here.

Applicant: Here?

S: Not over there, it has been finalised over there. I did place the lock, all finished; it will not be unlocked….

Applicant: Then where? (Unintelligible) … oh God.


	
	These extracts taken from the listening device material reflect the applicant’s role and, importantly, her knowledge of the matters surrounding the importation. Clearly, the applicant was shocked to learn of the substitution and enquired of Safizadeh whether he had packed the consignment “with his own hands”. As set out in the facts (at para. 8) Safizadeh’s fingerprints were found on some of the jars in the boxes. That was consistent with the Crown case that he had travelled to Iran to oversee the packing of the consignment. The inference to be drawn from the applicant’s enquiry of Safizadeh as to whether he had packed the boxes “with his own hands” is that she was aware of the fact that Safizadeh had travelled to Iran for the purposes of packing and overseeing the consignment.
	
	
	Other statements made by the applicant provide further support for the conclusion that she was aware of the nature of the importation from the outset. In this regard, her reference in the conversation (set out at [56] above) to “nineteen” is particularly telling, bearing in mind that the drugs were contained in nineteen specifically marked boxes.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending was high, and her role a substantial one. I am not able to accept that her offending was naïve, nor am I able to accept that it was unsophisticated. On the contrary, the applicant’s actions were deliberate, calculated and carried out in the knowledge that she was part of a significant importation of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	It is also important to bear in mind that the applicant agreed to have taken into account on sentence the additional offence of possession of a controlled drug. That was not a matter which was to be simply noted in passing: R v Bavadra [2000] NSWCCA 292; (2000) 115 A Crim R 152 at [30] per Wood CJ at CL, Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) and James J agreeing. The sentencing judge properly had regard to that matter. The sentence she imposed was reflective of the totality of the applicant’s criminality.
	
	
	Finally, reference was made to a schedule provided to the sentencing judge of sentences imposed in what were said to be cases of comparable offending. Whilst I have had regard to that schedule, it is necessary to emphasise that consistency in sentencing is not synonymous with numerical equivalence: The Queen v Pham [2015] HCA 39 at [28] per French CJ, Keane and Nettle JJ. What the applicant must establish, in order to succeed on this ground, is that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [6]). Having regard to the matters set out, the applicant has failed to do so. Accordingly, this ground is not made out.

		10 February 2016",2016-02-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2427231,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 24) [2016] NSWSC 105,"Judgment – EX TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	The Crown has called Justin McLannen in its case. Mr McLannen is currently giving evidence. Principally, his evidence is relied upon by the Crown for the purpose of rebutting what is anticipated to be evidence of good character which will be adduced in the case of the accused McNamara.
	
	
	Mr McLannen made a statement to the police on 16 January 2015 in which he detailed a meeting in early 2014 at which he, the accused and the deceased were in attendance. He alleges that in the course of that meeting, McNamara made a number of threats to him, in the context of inquiries which were then being undertaken by McNamara relating to the proceedings which had been brought against Chun Lok Lam and Chun Kit Lam.
	
	
	It is worth noting that some of Mr McLannen’s evidence appears to be independently corroborated by a document allegedly found on McNamara’s computer at the time of his arrest.
	
	
	In the course of giving evidence, the Crown sought leave for Mr McLannen to revive his memory in relation to two particular aspects of his statement. That application was opposed by Ms Shead, who appears on behalf of McNamara. The two areas in respect of which the Crown has made that application are paragraphs 21 and 24 of Mr McLannen's statement of 16 January 2015. Paragraph 21 is in the following terms:
	


“He asked me why I had that name and I didn't know that I did so I just told him it was the AFP's fuck up. He then went on to say something along the lines of 'Do you know what happens to rats that snitch? They end up hanging themselves, when you give them enough rope the guilt kills them'. He said, 'If they don't know what to do with the rope you may have to give them a hand'. I took what he said to mean that he would kill me if I gave a statement.”


	
	Paragraph 24 is in the following terms:
	


“I was shitting myself and agreed to what he said. He said to me, 'Do you know who I am?' I said 'No', he said, 'I am than ex-cop from Kings Cross, I was a bikie and I have seen things you could never imagine'. I just nodded my head and agreed with everything he was saying.”


	
	The Crown's application enlivens two particular sections of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”). The first is s. 32 which is in the following terms:
	


32 Attempts to revive memory in court

(1) A witness must not, in the course of giving evidence, use a document to try to revive his or her memory about a fact or opinion unless the court gives leave.

(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give leave, it is to take into account:

(a) whether the witness will be able to recall the fact or opinion adequately without using the document, and

(b) whether so much of the document as the witness proposes to use is, or is a copy of, a document that:

(i) was written or made by the witness when the events recorded in it were fresh in his or her memory, or

(ii) was, at such a time, found by the witness to be accurate.

(3) If a witness has, while giving evidence, used a document to try to revive his or her memory about a fact or opinion, the witness may, with the leave of the court, read aloud, as part of his or her evidence, so much of the document as relates to that fact or opinion.

(4) The court is, on the request of a party, to give such directions as the court thinks fit to ensure that so much of the document as relates to the proceeding is produced to that party.


	
	The second is s. 192 which is in the following terms:
	


192 Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms

(1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.

(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:

(a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and

(b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and

(c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and

(d) the nature of the proceeding, and

(e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.


	
	There is a dearth of authority as to the meaning of the term ""fresh in his or her memory"" as it appears in s. 32. In Graham v R [1998] HCA 61; (1998) 195 CLR 606, the High Court considered the phrase as it appears in s. 66 of the Act. The plurality (Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ) made the following observations (at paragraph [4]):
	


“The word 'fresh' in its context in s. 66 means recent or immediate. It may also carry with it a connotation that describes the quality of the memory (as being not deteriorated or changed by lapse of time) but the core of the meaning intended is to describe the temporal relationship between the ‘occurrence of the asserted fact’ and the time of the making of the representation. Although questions of fact and degree may arise, the temporal relationship required will very likely be measured in hours or days, not, as was the case here, years.”


	
	Taken by itself, that passage may lend support to the Crown's position. However, subsequent to the decision in Graham the Parliament amended 66 of the Act by inserting s. 2A. The effect of that amendment was to overcome the restrictive interpretation which had been applied by the High Court in Graham to the interpretation of the phrase ""fresh in the memory"".
	
	
	No corresponding amendment was made to the provisions of s. 32. In that regard the authors of Uniform Evidence in Australia (Lexis Nexis 2015) make the following observation (at p. 109):
	


“Under s. 32(2) the freshness of the event in the witness' memory when the events were recorded is just one of the matters that must be taken into account by the Court. Under s. 66(2) it is the only requirement. This difference in drafting together with the liberalisation of the freshness test in s. 66(2)A suggests the Court should not take a liberal approach in its consideration of whether the events were ‘fresh’ in s 32(2)(b)(i). Although there has been no amendment to s. 32 so as to bring it into line with s. 66(2)A, it is suggested that s. 66(2)A provides guidance to interpreting the freshness consideration in s. 32.”


	
	In making those observations, the authors make reference to a decision of Roth (a Pseudonym) v The Queen [2014] VSCA 242 where Neave and Priest JJA made the following observation (at [40]):
	


“Although it is unnecessary to decide the question we would have difficulty in accepting the argument that 'fresh in the memory' for the purposes of s. 32 of the Act should be read in the same manner as it was interpreted in Graham for the purposes of s. 66, which modifies the hearsay rule.”


	
	I am left to conclude, in these circumstances, that a generally liberal rather than a restrictive, approach is to be adopted in resolving the present question.
	
	
	Adopting that approach, I turn to the provisions of s. 32(2). That section sets out considerations which, although not exhaustive, are mandatory in determining whether or not leave should be granted.
	
	
	The first of those considerations is that contained in s. 32(2)(a). It requires that I take into account whether the witness will be able to recall the fact or opinion adequately without using a document, in this case his statement. I am satisfied in the circumstances Mr McLannen will not be able to recall those passages to which I have referred without reference to his statement.
	
	
	The second consideration in s. 32(2)(b) has two separate components. The first is whether the document from which it is sought that the witness revive his memory is one that was written or made when the events recorded in it were fresh in his memory. In the course of giving evidence, and in answer to a leading question from the Crown, the witness agreed with the proposition the relevant events were fresh in his memory at the time his statement was made. There was no further question put to the witness as to why this was so. Indeed, there was no further question put to the witness so as to confirm that he understood the import of the phrase ""fresh in his memory"".
	
	
	In my view, the submission of counsel for the accused that such an answer should be given very little weight is one which has considerable force. That is, in effect, the only direct evidence of the consideration set out in s. 32(2)(b)(i). It is not without significance that a period of 12 months elapsed between when the meeting took place and when Mr McClannen made his statement. That is an obviously significant period of time.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, I am not satisfied, that the relevant events were fresh in Mr McClannen’s memory at the time that the statement was made. That tends against a grant of leave. The second consideration, set out in s. 32(2)(b)(ii), is whether the witness found the statement to be accurate. I infer from the fact that he signed the statement that he did so.
	
	
	I have also had regard to the provisions of s. 192 and the considerations set out therein. Granting leave would not add unduly to the length of the trial, and I am not satisfied in all of the circumstances that if leave were granted it would operate in a way which was necessarily unfair to McNamara.
	
	
	As far as the importance of the evidence is concerned, it is relevant to note, as I have already outlined, the evidence does not go to a “core issue” in the case. Rather, it is led by the Crown to rebut the anticipated evidence of good character which will be led in the case for the accused. This is a further factor which tends against a grant of leave.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances, I do not propose to grant leave to allow the witness to refresh his memory from his statement.

2427256,R v Robert Flaherty [2016] NSWDC 124,"Judgment

STATUTORY NON-PUBLICATION OF NAMES OF VICTIMS


	
	I am sentencing a man for sexual assaults he committed against young boys 30 to 45 years ago. The man was then a parish priest and the boys were parishioners. The man is now 72 and in very poor health. So the sentencing must take account of the importance of punishing the man for serious offending in breach of trust and the significance as a mitigating factor of his age and ill health.
	
	
	The man’s name is Robert Flaherty. What I should say first are the offences that I am sentencing him for. There are five altogether. They are all offences against s81 of the Crimes Act 1900. Each of them carries a maximum of five years imprisonment. Section 81 of the Crimes Act was repealed in the 1980’s. It no longer exists as an offence. Nevertheless, at the time that Mr Flaherty committed these offences it was a crime in the statute books and he breached that piece of legislation in committing the crimes. Section 81, briefly described, is indecent assault on a male.
	
	
	Mr Flaherty pleaded guilty to three of the five offences. He pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. That is agreed to by the prosecution. So in due course he will receive an appropriate discount for any sentence which I impose. The Court of Criminal Appeal has indicated that if a person pleads guilty at the earliest available opportunity they are entitled to a discount of 25% on their sentence. That law is in place for practical reasons. It encourages people to plead guilty so that the court lists are not clogged up with so many trials that other cases are left unattended to. Also other accused persons or offenders would need to wait much longer for their cases to be dealt with. Hence a plea of guilty is encouraged by an offer of a discount. The plea of guilty of course must be genuine and given in acknowledgment of true guilt.
	
	
	The other two offences against s81 were not pleas of guilty. Mr Flaherty pleaded not guilty to those charges and he went to trial before me and a jury at Parramatta last year. On 17 September 2015 the jury found him guilty of those two offences. Accordingly, if I have not done already, I formally convict Robert Flaherty of the five offences including the two which the jury found him guilty of.
	
	
	It is important for a judge in sentencing a person to focus first on exactly what happened and the circumstances of what happened so that the judge can, in the course of the remarks, make an assessment of how serious an example the particular offence was of the crime that was created by Parliament. So I need to say something briefly about each of the offences.
	
	
	Here I am going to mention the names of the victims of these offences. There were not five victims but three. Mr Flaherty committed two offences against one of the victims and two offences against another. He committed one offence against the third victim. It is important for those listening in Court and listening to these remarks on sentence for them to know that the law protects the identity of persons who complain of sexual assaults. In other words alleged victims or, in a case such this, persons who are in fact victims, are entitled to their anonymity. Their names of course can be spoken in open Court but it is an offence in New South Wales to publish outside the Court anything which identifies a victim unless of course the victim consents.
	
	
	The first victim is V1. Two offences were committed against him. They were committed between 18 March 1971 and 31 December 1972. V1 and his family were parishioners at Our Lady of the Rosary Church in St Marys. Mr Flaherty was then the assistant priest at that church. In fact he arrived when V1 was aged around 14 years. V1 was very actively involved in the church and sometimes Mr Flaherty would drive V1 home after he had been doing duties at the church. He was a regular attender at mass not only on Sundays but during the week.
	
	
	There was an occasion around September 1972 when V1 was 15. I am about to describe the first offence against V1. Mr Flaherty was driving him home. He parked the car and asked V1 to touch him. V1 touched Mr Flaherty’s penis. V1 also exposed his own penis and then Mr Flaherty masturbated V1’s exposed penis with his hand for a brief period but not to ejaculation. The offence against V1 was around the same time Mr Flaherty was talking to V1 about sexual matters. It must be remembered that V1 was aged about 14. Despite being an assistant priest at the parish, Mr Flaherty invited V1 into his bedroom within the presbytery and asked him to sit on his bed. V1 complied. Whilst he was on the bed Mr Flaherty put his hand onto V1’s penis over his clothing for a brief period. That is the second offence.
	
	
	The agreed facts that were tendered as part of exhibit SA and exhibit SB by the prosecution record that V1 complained to a school teacher who in turn told V1’s father. V1’s father told the church and the matter was taken up by a bishop. The facts record that as a “result the offender was transferred from St Mary’s Church” to another church at the end of 1972.
	
	
	I will move now to the third offence, not the next one in time but the next one to which Mr Flaherty pleaded guilty. The third offence was committed between 4 February 1981 and 1 March 1982. In early 1981 Mr Flaherty had been appointed to act as an assistant priest in Richmond at St Monica’s Church. V2 and his family were regular parishioners. V2 was aged about 14. Mr Flaherty invited V2 and his brother and four other boys to stay at a house he had - a holiday house he had in Mollymook. Mr Flaherty drove the boys down. He had a Kombi van. Mr Flaherty determined the sleeping arrangements. V2 slept in a single bed and two others slept in a double bunk. Mr Flaherty slept in a stretcher bed. It was between V2’s single bed and the double bunk. Others were sleeping in another room. The facts go on to record that on the “first night before the boys went to bed the offender told a ghost story and then talked about birds and the bees, including masturbation”. Then what happened as recorded by the facts is this -
	


“V2 was awoken during the night by something rubbing his groin area over his sleeping bag. V2 looked and saw the offender, still lying in his stretcher bed, rubbing his hand on V2’s genital area. V2 pushed the offender’s hand away. The offender replaced his hand and continued rubbing V2’s genital area. V2 again pushed the offender’s hand away. And this time turned over to face away from the offender.”


	
	He stayed there facing away “and was very scared”. V2 did not complain for many years. In fact he first complained to his wife in 1996. What I have just described is the third of the five offences of indecent assault on a male against s 81 of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The other two offences were committed against the same victim. The victim’s name is V3. V3 was the first witness to give evidence in the jury trial last year when Mr Flaherty was being prosecuted for the two offences against him. The offences against him were committed between 2 August 1977 and 16 November 1978. Again then, Father Flaherty had taken some young people down to Mollymook. V3 shared a bedroom down there with Father Flaherty and a boy called Geoff. Again “Father Flaherty slept between both our beds”. V3 described to the jury what happened. He said that he “woke up through the night and I had a wet sensation on me penis and I put me arm down to see what it was and I felt somebody’s face and he was what I now know was having oral sexual with me”. The jury accepted beyond reasonable doubt that it was Mr Flaherty who was the perpetrator. Mr Flaherty “had my penis in his mouth and he was holding the bottom of my penis and he was bobbing his head up and down”. Understandably V3, who was then in his early teenage years, did not know what to do, and “I just laid there on me back”. I am reading from T8 - T9 of the trial transcript. V3 goes on that “after some time I ejaculated and he wiped the sperm on me”. He said he remembered “the sperm landed on me stomach, landing on me stomach and on me - and on me thigh. I remember him playing with the end of me - end of me penis, rubbing his thumb over the top of my penis”. That is the fourth offence against s 81 that I will be sentencing Mr Flaherty for.
	
	
	Mr M Paish, the Crown Prosecutor, then asked V3 what was “the next thing you can recall?” V3 went on to describe that Father Flaherty “then proceeded to roll me over so I was facing the wall”. His left leg was straight and his right leg was bent, then he said that “when I was in that position, I remember he lifted my cheek of my bum and I felt something being inserted into my bum”. He was wearing his pyjamas. Father Flaherty was behind him when he “inserted something into my bottom”.
	
	
	Understandably, V3 yelled and told him to stop. “Father Flaherty told me not to make too much noise and not to wake my sister up”. The next day Father Flaherty “told me words to the effect that I wasn’t to tell anybody what happened the night before” (T13). In fact, he went on and “threatened to leave me down there if I was to tell my sister”. He went on to say that his “parents would never believe me as he always - as he hears their confessions and that they wouldn’t - that my parents wouldn’t believe me that what had happened would be true”. A couple of weeks later back at church Father Flaherty, in the vestry, asked V3 whether he had told his parents and V3 said he had not. V3 recalls father Flaherty saying, “That’s good, let’s keep it that way”.
	
	
	Eventually all the men complained to the police. It was many years later. I make no comment at all about why there was such a delay. The law in this State provides that there are many good reasons why a victim of sexual assault may not complain at an early opportunity.
	
	
	On 2 July 2013 police arrested Mr Flaherty at his home in Wentworth Falls. He was taken to the police station and interviewed. He admitted to some extent the claims made by V1 and V2. He denied the offences which V3 claimed he had committed as well. Hence that led to the trial.
	
	
	Both V1 and V3 delivered victim impact statements to me last week. In fact V1’s victim impact statement was delivered by his sister on his behalf. They were both very moving and stark accounts of how this kind of crime can affect a young boy and the man he later becomes.
	
	
	V1 said that he started to engage in very anti-social behaviour. It started after the sexual assault on him. He had long periods of instability in his life. He had difficulties in relationships. He was married three times and they broke down. He came to get some counselling in 2003. He felt isolated from his family. He said that, until counselling, “I didn’t know how to cope with my emotions”. Counselling has helped him to deal with this. It is very commendable that he took this step in order to assist him in dealing with the trauma of the crime that was committed by him. It also, no doubt, took some courage to report the offences and to put together the victim impact statement.
	
	
	I make the same remarks about V3 so far as the courage to report the offences and to put the victim impact statement together. V3 emphasised the impact on him of the breach of trust. As a boy he was eager to grow up to become old enough to be an altar boy. He wanted to be closer to the leaders of the church who would “help me though life and give me the courage, guidance and determination to succeed in my young teenage years”. He was proud that he received awards for religious knowledge in primary school. His next sentence is “How stupid was I?” He went on to say that it was “the leaders of the church that contributed to the mess that my life has become”. He became distant from his family, he rebelled against the church, he left school when he was 15 and started binge-drinking. He had a dozen jobs in the first year after leaving school. He recalls how his parents, who were practising Catholics, would “instil in me to trust people that my parents trusted and respected”. He said that his parents “would never have allowed my siblings or I to go away on holidays with someone they knew for less than six months unless he or she would wear a white collar because these people guaranteed they could be trusted as they were leaders in the church”.
	
	
	V3 found that he had difficulty in being affectionate in his relations as he got older. He has had over two dozen different jobs since he left school. He went into youth work thinking that he could help, but he “became cynical about the justice system.” He saw “kids blamed for what adults had done to them and the adults that did not listen to them.” When the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Assault was announced, and was continually in the news, he knew he had to do something and he reported the assaults which had occurred against him. He says that he has “trust issues.” He said what happened “has robbed me from having a faith”, asking rhetorically how he can have “faith in a church that allows a known paedophile to move from parish to parish giving them a brand new playground of vulnerable children.”
	
	
	Offences such as these, committed on a teenager, can lead to moments of anguish at ordinary times in their lives. V3 gives a simple example. He says that it is “unavoidable trying not to think of him as over the years whenever I see a kookaburra, I think of him. We fed a few kookaburras down at his holiday house but now it doesn’t matter what mood I am in when I see a kookaburra the shame and guilt and anger rise to the surface.”
	
	
	These victim impact statements illustrate why Parliament regards the offences as so serious. Indeed, Parliament now regards the kinds of crimes committed by Mr Flaherty 30 to 45 years ago as more serious if they were committed now. I must of course sentence Mr Flaherty according to the law that he broke when he committed these crimes, not according to the law as it is now which he has not broken. In those days, the maximum sentence for each of the five crimes he committed was five years imprisonment. Even then when the sentences were, relatively speaking, more lenient for these kinds of crime, Parliament regarded them as so serious that it would expose an offender to some years imprisonment for these sorts of crimes. The victim impact statements illustrate graphically why Parliament took that view.
	
	
	Mr Flaherty, after he was arrested, had no time in custody. I now need to make some assessment of how serious an example of the offence each of the crimes is. Obviously two persons can commit the same crime, but one person may commit it in a far more serious way than the other person. The same goes for one offender who commits the same crime against different victims. One of the crimes might be a very serious example of that offence. Another crime might be a far less serious example of the same offence. That is the sort of assessment I need to make.
	
	
	The first offence against V1 was not at the lowest end of seriousness for this sort of crime. It was not for a number of reasons. Two of them are that Mr Flaherty touched V1’s exposed penis. In other words there was flesh on flesh and Mr Flaherty’s actions encouraged an arousal on V1’s part but to a limited extent. The second aspect, which applies to all of them, is that it occurred in circumstances involving a very serious breach of trust by a priest against one of his parishioners; not only that, but a parishioner who was a teenager. It is far from being the most serious example of this sort of crime and would be towards the lower end but not at the lower end.
	
	
	The other offence against V1 was towards the lower end, or towards the lowest end. He put his hand on to V1’s penis over his clothing. Again, there is the factor of the breach of trust which is an aggravating factor but there was not the aspect of skin on skin touching.
	
	
	The offence against V2 is probably in the same category as the first offence against V1. It was committed against V2 when he was sleeping. He woke up to feel the priest rubbing his groin.
	
	
	Despite V2 pushing his hand away Father Flaherty replaced his hand and continued rubbing the genital area. V2 had to push his hand away again and turn away. Although it did not involve skin to skin contact it was the persistence in the activity and the fact that it was committed against a sleeping boy causing him to wake up that to my mind makes it about as serious as the first offence against V1.
	
	
	The two offences against V3 are in another category. Mr Paish argued that both of those crimes “would be at the upper level of seriousness for acts covered by s 81.” (I am reading from the third page of MFI #14, which were Mr Paish’s written submissions on sentence.) I have just noticed that, in fact, Mr Paish submitted that the three other offences, the ones against V1 and V2, “would be towards the lower level of seriousness.” I accept that submission, but I regard the first offence against V1 and the offence against V2 as being relatively more serious than the second offence against V1.
	
	
	I also accept the submission of Mr Paish that the two offences committed against V3 are in the upper level of seriousness for those crimes, both involved penetration. The act of sucking the boy’s penis was committed against him whilst he was asleep. The action woke him. The offender persevered until the boy ejaculated. In fact V3 acknowledged that it was the first time he had ejaculated so that the experience was new to him and unfamiliar.
	
	
	The second act occurred shortly after the first. Again it was an act of penetration. Again it persevered. In fact, V3 said that he first felt something inserted into his anus and then something larger inserted into his anus. He, nor I, can say what it was, or they were, that were inserted into his anus. But again it was an example of persistent offending after the first offence and committed, as both were, in very serious breach of trust. V3 was down at Mollymook with Mr Flaherty because his parents had complete trust in the priest with whom they allowed their children to travel and with whom they allowed their children to stay overnight. In breach of that trust placed in him by the parents and by the children he committed two very serious crimes against V3.
	
	
	It is important for a judge not only to take into account the seriousness of the crimes that happened, but also, of course, the personal circumstances of the offender. This becomes obvious when one thinks about it for a moment. One offender might have a long record for similar offences. Another might have committed the offences for the first time. One offender might have a very serious mental health problem, another offender may not. An offender might have committed offences when they were on bail, another offender might not. So it important to consider the personal circumstances of any offender, including Mr Flaherty.
	
	
	Here Ms L Rowan, who appeared for Mr Flaherty in the trial and the sentence proceedings, has provided a good amount of material. I should say the first item was, in fact, tendered by the Crown as it was a Pre-Sentence Report which is usually put into evidence by the prosecution. The Pre-Sentence Report was helpful. It recorded Mr Flaherty’s relatively stable upbringing and his entry into the seminary at about aged 17 and his early years in his priestly life, including some difficulties which he encountered. In fact, it recorded that Mr Flaherty’s brother commended him for his “generosity towards less fortunate parishioners, which included providing his residence in Mollymook to families for holiday use.” I do not say that critically. I say it because it is an aspect highlighted by his brother of generosity. Of course, he breached the trust in these cases.
	
	
	The report noted that Mr Flaherty retired in 2010. It acknowledged that he had been moved away from a parish once the offences were reported, or at least one of the offences. The report noted that Mr Flaherty “presented with little insight, commenting that he thought the first victim had been cooperative and that he did not think it would have the impact that it did. The report said that Mr Flaherty frequently disassociated himself from the offences, speaking of the offences in broad terms as an issue across the organisation for which he worked.”
	
	
	The author of the report assessed Mr Flaherty as a medium to low risk of re-offending. I, myself, would think that at this stage and age and in poor health, that his risk is very low. It noted documents, medical reports, pointing to the significant health issues. He lives alone and has a “largely solitary existence.” He showed “little victim empathy”. The author could see a few treatment options which would be of benefit. Supervision would be unlikely to be of any benefit and he is unsuitable for Community Service.
	
	
	There is a psychological pre-sentence report by a senior psychologist with Community Corrections. Again it noted his lack of insight or empathy for the victims of his crimes. The “dynamic risk issues that were present at the time of the offence are most likely no longer present given there has been no sexual re-offending or new charges over three decades, based upon the information provided.” He would not be a priority for sex offender programs. It is recommended that is “not involved in any child related work.”
	
	
	I return to the material presented by Ms Rowan on behalf of her client. There is a report from a Dr Sasikaran, a consultant geriatrician, dated 27 January 2015. It lists a series of problems. There is a chronic pain syndrome, there is depression, social isolation, obesity and chronic renal failure, although that is stable. There is cardiomyopathy, again that is stable. Mr Flaherty has type 2 diabetes and hyperparathyroidism. There is a goitre issue and he has sleep apnoea. There is a prostate problem, but a question about whether there is any malignancy. He is taking a wide range of medications. At that stage his main problem was his chronic pain. That doctor was “concerned about his future”. He was concerned about him being imprisoned and recommended leniency “considering his multiple medical and psychological problems.”
	
	
	There is a consultant physician and cardiologist, Dr John England, who has provided a number of reports about Mr Flaherty. In one report, which was on 6 August 2015 and became exhibit 2, Dr England described Mr Flaherty’s prognosis as “guarded in terms of months to years.” Dr England thought Mr Flaherty had “moderate frailty and vulnerability.” He has had a number of falls, one of which meant that his sentence proceedings were delayed. His vascular disease will be accelerated by his chronic renal failure and hyperglycaemia.” Medication means that when he falls he has difficulty getting up again. Dr England thought that if in a custody situation “he will need to have intensive nursing care and regular” consultations with doctors. His mental health will be affected if he was to be in custody. He thought that Mr Flaherty would be “at risk of self-harm and a certain risk of suicide or sudden death.” More specifically, he felt that Mr Flaherty’s “prognosis is six-12 months regardless of any medical intervention.” He noticed a general decline in Mr Flaherty’s demeanour. This was in the report, exhibit S3 dated 14 September 2015, from which I have been quoting.
	
	
	An MRI of the brain “shows disease and atrophy close to the hippocampus region of the brain which is linked to vascular debenture and Alzheimer’s disease.”
	
	
	He provided a report of 23 November 2015, as exhibit S4, about the fall which he had last year.
	
	
	There is a report dated 19 November 2015 from his GP, Dr Anthony Lee, which lists a large number of current medications taken by Mr Flaherty and the past history of a large number of conditions.
	
	
	Mr Flaherty was sent to the forensic psychologist, Tim Watson-Munro, who provided a report dated 18 February 2016 which became exhibit S8. Mr Watson-Munro noted that Mr Flaherty was “clearly physically and mentally ill.” When interviewing him Mr Flaherty “impressed as a very unwell man who had great difficulty at times in following my line of questioning with inappropriate affect, as noted by the other practitioners.” He also appears to be a “very depressed and anxious man who lives a very lonely life.” His exposure to the “realities of the criminal justice system has been highly traumatic.” Mr Watson-Munro stated “with some certainty that Father Flaherty will have an exceptionally difficult time in custody.” Because of his age and the nature of his offending and his general vulnerability he will no doubt go into protection and, Mr Watson-Munro thought, “it is unlikely that he will receive the type of specialist care he is currently obtaining.” Mr Watson-Munro thought “it may well be the case that his demise is hastened by a term of imprisonment.” He also doubted that Mr Flaherty “would respond in any meaningful way to psychotherapy” because of his cognitive limitations.
	
	
	Finally, Ms Rowan tendered as exhibit S9 a letter from Mr Flaherty dated 2 December 2015. He acknowledged the fairness of the trial and the integrity of the jurors and their decision. He went on to say that he “cannot recall the assaults of which I have been found guilty. If these took place I express my sincere apology to V3 and his family.”
	
	
	Mr Flaherty has no criminal convictions and that is a matter which can be brought to his credit in the sentencing proceedings. Any person presenting before a Court without any criminal convictions has that benefit. I think that it is unlikely that Mr Flaherty will offend for the medical or psychological reasons expressed in some of the reports.
	
	
	There is an issue about whether exhibit S9, the letter of apology, could amount to evidence of remorse. Mr Paish took exception to its tender in the first place. I permitted it to be admitted, but realistically Ms Rowan acknowledged that it cannot be evidence of remorse. As she asked rhetorically, how can her client “be sorry for something he doesn’t remember doing.” She realistically said that the apology is the best he can do given his limited capacity. She acknowledged that the letter is not evidence of remorse. I think she is correct in that submission. It does not go against him that he has no remorse, but he does not have the benefit of being able to express remorse. That is partly because, as Ms Rowan said, he lacks the capacity to express remorse.
	
	
	I was assisted by both counsel providing written and oral submissions about the appropriate sentence. Mr Paish’s submissions became MFI 14. At all times Mr Paish submitted Mr Flaherty was an ordained Catholic Priest, active in the church in which the victims were either attendees or alter boys.
	
	
	There is an obvious issue here about sentencing a person for offences committed many years ago. The issue has been dealt by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The leading case is R v Moon [2000] NSWCCA 534; 117 A Crim R 497. Fitzgerald JA agreed with Howie J. Howie J, with respect, very helpfully addressed the issue of sentencing in the present day for offences which were committed many years ago against a now repealed law. His Honour at [67] said that the first issue is that the “Court must have regard to the maximum penalty for the offence at the time when the crime was committed.” His Honour said that that will “indicate the policy of the legislature at the time the offence was committed.” I have already remarked that Parliament regarded the crime as so serious that it attached a prison sentence to the crime of a maximum of five years. His Honour reminded sentencers that the “maximum penalty is intended for cases falling within the worst category of cases for which the penalty is prescribed.” His Honour went on in the following paragraph to observe that the “Court must consider where in the range of the conduct covered by the statutory offence, the particular criminal conduct committed by the offender falls.” That is why I made the findings about how serious the crimes were that Mr Flaherty has committed. His Honour said that such a finding “will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie.” His Honour commended that approach when “sentencing an offender for offences committed many years earlier and where no sentencing range current at the time of the offending can be established.”
	
	
	In Moon’s case the offensive behaviour involved mutual masturbation and in one case putting the offender’s penis between the victim’s buttocks. Howie J observed that the sentence imposed at first instance “falls in the upper range of sentences for offences under s 81, notwithstanding that I would expect sentences in this range to involve more serious conduct than that committed by the applicant.” His Honour went on to observe that “offences including some form of penetration or offences by persons in trust” were examples of more serious conduct. In Moon’s case there was a plea of guilty as well. (The last quotation was from [75].) At [81] his Honour summarised why he would allow the appeal and quash the sentence and substitute a lower sentence. He said that “in a case such as this where there has been such a lengthy delay between offence and sentence, and where the offender is rehabilitated, it is the fact of imprisonment rather than the length of the sentence which will be of greatest significance to punish the offender and denounce his conduct”.
	
	
	Mr Paish drew my attention to his Honour’s remarks in Moon’s case. Mr Paish went on to say that the Crown “has insufficient material to establish a sentencing range for this offence between 1972 and 1981”. He went on to submit, however, that the Crown “does not concede that had the offender been sentenced in 1981 he would have stood a reasonable chance of obtaining a non-custodial sentence”. Mr Paish submitted that when the “combination of the maximum penalty and the actual sexual acts are considered, the objective seriousness of the crimes require fulltime sentence”.
	
	
	Mr Paish emphasised what he described as “one central aggravating feature”. That was Mr Flaherty’s position as a Catholic priest. It was through that role that he gained access to his three victims and “in a position of special trust was able to commit these offences under the noses of their respective families”. He even went on in V3’s case to use his position “to silence the victim by telling him he would not be believed by his own parents due to the position of trust that the offender held”.
	
	
	Mr Paish reminded me of remarks of various Justices of the High Court in Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 and I must therefore bear in mind that although there is limited evidence of Mr Flaherty’s good character it must be borne in mind that his character provided a vehicle for him to commit his offences.
	
	
	Mr Paish submitted that the offences must be punished by a period of fulltime in custody.
	
	
	Ms Rowan too took me to the case law about sentencing for historical sexual offences. She drew my attention to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Magnuson v The Queen [2013] NSWCCA 50. Button J delivered the judgment of the Court and Ms Rowan reminded me of the principles which his Honour summarised from [83] onwards. His Honour observed at [91] that “the statistical material provided to her Honour demonstrates that the offence of indecent assault, including against children, was dealt with more leniently many years ago than it is now”. His Honour referred to statistics from the 1970s indicating that a fewer than half the number of offenders were given sentences of fulltime imprisonment. They are of course statistics and we do not know the details of the offending behaviour. His Honour made observations at [145] about the non-parole period generally being shorter in those days.
	
	
	Ms Rowan submitted that “the present case is on all fours with that considered in Magnuson”. She did not concede that “only a fulltime custodial sentence is appropriate”. She acknowledged that ordinarily a custodial sentence would be appropriate. It is neither necessary nor inevitable in every case. She urged me to take into account the discount which is appropriate for the pleas of guilty and the fact that the V1 and V2 matters could have been dealt with summarily. She acknowledged the significance of the breach of trust and the limited impact of any good character. She too reminded me of the remarks of McHugh J in Ryan’s case.
	
	
	There is some extra curial punishment in the fact that Mr Flaherty’s status and privileges as a priest have been withdrawn. I do take that into account in a limited way.
	
	
	Ms Rowan referred me to the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in R v Sopher (1993) 70 A Crim R 570. The Court delivered a joint judgment acknowledging at 573 the following –
	


“Health and age are relevant to the length of any sentence but usually of themselves would not lead to a gaol sentence not being imposed if it were otherwise warranted. Much depends on the circumstances”.


	
	Their Honours said that an “appropriate balance has to be maintained between the criminality of the conduct in question and any damage to health or shortening of life”.
	
	
	Ms Rowan took me to cases which deal with offenders who may effectively receive a life sentence because of their advanced age or disability. In R v Mammone [2006] NSWCCA 138 the Court acknowledged at [45] that “the advanced age of the respondent entitled him to some discount in sentencing, on the basis that serving a term of imprisonment will be more than usually onerous for him”. Ms Rowan reminded me that I cannot “overlook that each year of a sentence of imprisonment may represent a substantial proportion of the life left to an offender”. She reminded me that what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Pfeiffer v R [2009] NSWCCA 145 at [15] that where the “health problems of an individual offender are such that his or her life in prison will be more burdensome than for a healthy person, it may be appropriate to reflect those considerations in a reduced sentence”. She referred me to Barton v R [2009] NSWCCA 164 where the Court at [22] referred to a principle that “may in the case of an offender of middle to advanced years have the practical effect of a life sentence”.
	
	
	Ms Rowan reminded me of her client’s physical disability and chronic illnesses and argued for special circumstances if I do impose a custodial sentence. She reminded me of the significance of delay combined with the considerations of ill health and her client’s age. She reminded me of the prognosis of six to 12 months.
	
	
	Mr Paish on the other hand pointed out that that is a prognosis which may or may not come to be realised. Ms Rowan reminded me that delay was not the fault of her client.
	
	
	I come now to consider the appropriate sentences for these offences. So far as the first offence against V1 and the offence against V2 are concerned, I have said that they are more serious examples of this crime. I would regard in each case a sentence of one month imprisonment as being appropriate. The second offence against V1 was less serious for the reasons that I have given and in the ordinary course I would have imposed a good behaviour bond for what occurred.
	
	
	I repeat, the offences committed against V3 are more serious. I have accepted Mr Paish’s submission that they are in the upper range of seriousness for these kinds of crimes. Although he submitted that it is difficult to imagine a form of sexual assault or indecent assault more serious than the two examples of penetration which occurred in this case, I would not regard it as a worst case; but I do regard them as serious offences. I think that a starting point for each of them is a sentence of four years imprisonment.
	
	
	However, it is here that first I must take into account that for the offences committed against V1 and V2, Mr Flaherty pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. I would therefore reduce each of those sentences from one month imprisonment to three weeks imprisonment.
	
	
	Having regard to an appropriate starting place of four years imprisonment for the serious offences committed against V3, it is here that I come to balance the “criminality of the conduct ...and any damage to health or shortening of life” as the Court of Criminal Appeal said in Sopher at 373.
	
	
	Despite regarding an appropriate sentence as one being four years, I would reduce that sentence because of the obvious fact that Mr Flaherty is going to have a much harder time in prison and because of his age, to one of two years imprisonment for each of the offences.
	
	
	Ms Rowan asked me to consider suspending the sentences. That in a sense has been the significant issue in these sentence proceedings. Should I send Mr Flaherty to fulltime gaol for the crimes which he has committed - especially against V3 - or should I fix a prison sentence but suspend it?
	
	
	To my mind the offending behaviour against V3 is such that it would not be appropriate to allow Mr Flaherty not to serve some full time in prison. In other words, I think that the sentence of imprisonment of two years which I have in mind for Mr Flaherty should be a sentence of fulltime imprisonment. I will come shortly to the different question of his non-parole period.
	
	
	Because he has committed offences against different victims, I am going to fix the various sentences to be served concurrently. The overall sentence will be one of two years and three weeks. It will commence today, 25 February 2016. It therefore will expire on a date two years and three weeks after today’s date. In due course we will work out what that appropriate date is going to be.
	
	
	I think the real impact of the state of Mr Flaherty’s health and age, particularly the prognosis given to him by Dr England and the impact of the prison sentence which Mr Watson-Munro thinks it will have on him must be reflected in the non-parole period. I am going to fix a non-parole period of six months which will commence today 25 February 2016 and which will therefore expire later this year on 24 August 2016.
	
	
	Now I just pause from my remarks on sentence there. I should add there are special circumstances for the non-parole period being significantly shorter than that envisaged by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Those special circumstances are the state of Mr Flaherty health and the observations by medical practitioners and Mr Watson-Munro about the impact of prison.
	


HIS HONOUR:    Now I need to calculate when the expiry date of a prison sentence of two years and three weeks will be.

ROWAN: Your Honour my instructing solicitor’s done the maths. 17 March 2018.

HIS HONOUR: Would you mind checking that Ms Latimer. It sounds right to me. I think that’s right. That’s 21 days. Do you agree?

LATIMER: I do your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: So let me get this right.


	
	I am going to impose an aggregate sentence under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I would have imposed a sentence for the offence against V1 of two weeks and a sentence for the offence against V2 of one week. As I said, I would have imposed a good behaviour bond in respect of the second offence against V1. The sentence for the offences against V3 would be two years and served concurrently, that is because they occurred on the same occasion and against the same victim. Each of them warranted a sentence of two years imprisonment but the fact that they occurred at the same time means that they can be served concurrently. I would fix a non-parole period of six months which commences today 25 February 2016 and expires on 24 August 2016. The overall sentence would expire on 17 March 2018.
	
	
	Mr Flaherty I have to sentence you now. I sentence you to a sentence of two years and three weeks imprisonment. The sentence will commence today 25 February 2016 and will expire in two years and three weeks’ time, namely on 17 March 2018. I fix a non-parole period during which you must be imprisoned of six months. It too starts today 25 February 2016 and it will expire on 24 August 2016. Under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order directing your release on parole on 24 August 2016.
	
	
	So Mr Flaherty I deliberately did not ask for the Correctives to come in beforehand but I should check are they still here. Good they are coming up thank you very much. Shortly Corrective Services officers will arrive and they will take you into custody. In a moment I will leave the bench so that you have an opportunity to talk to Ms Rowan and Mr Benetatos before you are taken into custody. You will commence your custody today and you will be released on parole on 24 August 2016, that is in six months from today.
	


HIS HONOUR: Conditions of parole? Good behaviour really and notifying the Court of his address. I do not think anything else Ms Latimer, I do not think he needs supervision, do you agree?

LATIMER: When your Honour was reciting the facts for the counts 2 of V1 your Honour indicated that he was 14 years at the time, he was 15 years at the time according to the facts.

HIS HONOUR: Fifteen.

LATIMER: Just a slight correction there your Honour and can I just double check your Honour the indicative sentences for V1.


	
	V1 the first offence is two weeks, it’s an indicative sentence of two weeks and for V2 the only offence is one week. They are cumulative. The first starts today, the second would commence in two weeks’ time and then the sentence of six months for the offences against V3, two years commencing in three weeks’ time. Hence the overall aggregate sentence of two years and three months.
	


LATIMER: Yes and the indicative sentence in relation to the second V1.


	
	The second V1 that’s a good behaviour bond. So I should impose that in respect of the second offence against V1 under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment I direct that Mr Flaherty enter into a good behaviour bond for 12 months.
	


LATIMER: I don’t know whether your Honour needs to actually make that order given you’ve given an aggregate sentence.

HIS HONOUR: No it’s not part of the aggregate sentence because it’s not a sentence of imprisonment. I think I’m right am I, s 53A?

ROWAN: I think that’s right, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: It said aggregate sentence of imprisonment.

LATIMER: I think you mentioned the first offence was V1, that was my confusion, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: How does he enter into the good behaviour bond, does he do that in custody?

ROWAN: He can do that in custody as I understand, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, Ms Rowan.

ROWAN: Your Honour, the sentence having been handed down, I would like to be heard on the question of bail. Your Honour heard during the submissions on sentence that a notice of intention to apply for leave to appeal has been lodged with the Court of Criminal Appeal. That indeed was lodged.

HIS HONOUR: Is that a leave to appeal from conviction?

ROWAN: Section 62 of the Bail Act 2013 applies. So that I’m not catching my friend unawares, it’s very short s 62.

HIS HONOUR: Thanks, let’s have a look.

LATIMER: What was the section?

ROWAN: 62, Bail Act 2013 -

“A Court may hear a bail application for an offence if:

(a) the Court has convicted a person of the offence; (b) proceedings on an appeal against sentence or conviction are pending in another Court; and (c) the person has not yet made his or her first appearance before the Court in the appeal proceedings.”

HIS HONOUR: So it’s a notice of intention to appeal against the convictions.

ROWAN: Yes your Honour, and that was lodged on 25 September 2015 and indeed as Mr Crown pointed out during the submissions it was already showing up on the database. Obviously there hasn’t been a first appearance at this point in time, but in my submission the appeal proceedings are engaged and accordingly he would fall within the criteria of s 62 for the consideration of the question of bail. It then becomes a matter for your Honour as to - because it does say the Court may consider.

HIS HONOUR: Is there any statutory guidance to the considerations relevant to bail - appeal bail?

ROWAN: Not that I could find. It’s safe to say, your Honour, that I accept it is in fairly unusual circumstances that appeal bail is given. However noting the non-parole period that your Honour has imposed, and as we know judicial notice of the length of time that an appeal takes were he not to have bail during that process, then the sentence will be effected by the time we get to the hearing of the appeal, and that’s combined with the medical evidence which your Honour already has.

HIS HONOUR: All right, let’s just take a step back. Did you know about the application, Ms Latimer?

LATIMER: No your Honour, I didn’t, but I did foreshadow a potential bail application in the sense that this section may be raised. The Crown’s position is that an appeal is not on foot, it is not pending. Only a notice of intention to appeal has been filed and therefore this section would not be operative.

HIS HONOUR: I’ll tell you what I’m thinking, both of you, that I would hear you to try to determine that (a) we’ve got a question about whether s 62 is engaged or not. You say it is, you say it’s not. I would like someone to look it up for me and find out whether it is or isn’t. (B) Then there are the criteria about determining appeal bail. My recollection is there’s some law about that, applied either at first instance, which I am, or by the appellate jurisdiction, and there’s some assessment made of the prospects of success, that’s my recollection. I had to determine appeal bail in a case where an offender was convicted I think late in 2014 after a trial, and defence counsel took me through various issues from memory, including the prospects of success and things like that. In other words I don’t think it’s something which I just decide because your client is at an advanced stage and in poor health.

For example, another factor would be the relevance of the sentence. He’s got a non-parole period of six months. That’s obviously a relevant factor. I remember now, I think I asked defence counsel to find out when the appeal was likely to be heard. I mean obviously I need to have this information. I mean I would consider giving your client bail overnight for this to be argued tomorrow, and I need it to be argued tomorrow because I am then on leave for quite some time.

ROWAN: I can accommodate that, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: So either you or somebody replacing you needs to argue it tomorrow and you need the information.

LATIMER: Your Honour, the only difficulty I have with that is that if s 62 is not engaged, then your Honour has convicted the offender and he must go into prison today.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, all right.

LATIMER: It’s a complicated issue, but from my

HIS HONOUR: Let’s have a look at it then. So you say I need to look at that now? So I look at that issue now and the merits of it tomorrow if I decide against you and in favour of Ms Rowan. So you’re saying I really have to decide.

LATIMER: Yes your Honour, and I’m not necessarily in a position to deal with this particular issue myself in terms of case law and statutory assistance to your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I understand, but it needs to be determined this evening, doesn’t it?

LATIMER: It does, your Honour.

ROWAN: Your Honour could commence the sentences tomorrow.

HIS HONOUR: Fair point, I think that’s the answer.

LATIMER: Potentially could.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Flaherty is hardly a risk of flight, unless you say he is. I don’t know whether you - have you got a police officer here who might

LATIMER: I do, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: You do?

LATIMER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Do you want to get some instructions? I’m thinking of commencing the sentence tomorrow and you two arguing, or whoever is available arguing the case tomorrow. But if you tell me that there is some risk of Mr Flaherty

LATIMER: If your Honour is minded to commence the sentence tomorrow and defer the actual sentence, then bail would then continue on the same conditions as before.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

ROWAN: Is there a residential condition? I just note that Mr Flaherty resides in Katoomba. I can’t recall that there is a residential condition, but it may not be feasible for him to get back to

HIS HONOUR: Is he down here? Is he staying here - likely to stay here?

ROWAN: Would your Honour perhaps consider the argument at not before 12 and that will give him time to get home, get his medication and

HIS HONOUR: Look, I would, yes.

ROWAN: And frankly time for me to do the same thing and get some

HIS HONOUR: No, that’s all right. What about you, Ms Latimer, not before 12?

LATIMER: I think not before 2, your Honour. Mr Paish may wish to appear on this matter and he is currently in a trial. I’m not sure where he is at this stage.

HIS HONOUR: Who is that, Mr Paish?

LATIMER: Mr Paish, that’s correct.

HIS HONOUR: You better have backup for Mr Paish because if he’s not available I need someone at 2 o’clock to argue two points. One is the applicability of s 62. Ms Rowan says yes, that applies, you say no, it doesn’t. Now that is a matter of statutory construction. I would need tendered, for example, the notice of intention to appeal.

ROWAN: I can do that now.

HIS HONOUR: Do you want to tender it now?

ROWAN: I have a copy.

HIS HONOUR: Do it all tomorrow, let’s not hold things up now. So I would need that in evidence, I would need any arguments. I would need any decisions about this section. I mean it may well have come up before. The second issue is the merits of it and any law on that. As I said I might be wrong in my recollection, but I seem to remember, and I’ll ask my associate to see if she can find a decision I made in a case, where in that case I refused bail. I think I did. It was late 2014, it was a Commonwealth offence. You’ll find it, it’s probably published. It was a Taiwanese national, a woman. There will be a number of judgments and there will be a sentence. I’m just trying to remember the name of the counsel.

ROWAN: That would help, if I know them I could ring them.

HIS HONOUR: I know, that’s what I was thinking. I haven’t got my diary with me so I can’t look it up. We’ll see if we can find it. Finding the case is what you want or finding any other cases about appeal bail. Now you need to be on notice, Ms Rowan, that if I’m against you, your client needs, as I’m sure you’ve advised him, to be ready to go into custody tomorrow.

ROWAN: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: It may be that he loses on the legal point, it may be that he loses on the merits point, so he needs to know that, as I’m sure you and Mr Benetatos have told him. Ms Latimer, I’ll hear you or counsel or another representative from your office. I’ve got a pretty full day tomorrow, including a judgment that I think I’m delivering tomorrow at some stage so it might be a long day.

ROWAN: What I can do, your Honour, is I will be obviously looking on the internet. If I find material relevant to the application on either or both points, I can certainly email those through to your Honour’s associate.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you. My associate will give each of you her email. She will write it out and give you a card - not a card, she will write it on a piece of paper. She will write the chambers’ telephone number so that you are able to send any material in advance, which would be appreciated, but if not that’s fine. I will list it for 2 o’clock and bail is continued. There aren’t any reporting conditions are there or there are?

ROWAN: No, they were deleted, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: He doesn’t have any conditions that would affect him for the next 24 hours, does he?

LATIMER: Not that I’m aware of, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: But he’s going to go home tonight so I don’t have to vary that.

ROWAN: He’s going to go home.

HIS HONOUR: Okay, all right, 2 o’clock tomorrow.

		08 July 2016",2016-02-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2427301,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 30) [2016] NSWSC 168,"Judgment EX-TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	In the course of cross-examination of the witness Jessica McNamara by Ms Shead of counsel (who appears for the accused McNamara) a question was asked, the purpose of which was to elicit evidence a conversation which Ms McNamara is said to have had with her father whilst he was in custody on or about 31 May 2014. Objection was taken to the question by both Crown and by Mr Thomas.
	
	
	In the absence of the jury, Ms Shead informed me that she expected that Ms McNamara would respond by saying that her father had said words to the effect ""He"" (meaning Rogerson) ""just shot him. I didn't know what was happening and he told me he would kill you girls. I was looking down the barrel of a gun"".
	
	
	Mr Thomas' first objection was on the basis of s. 59 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”) which creates the hearsay rule. However as I understood it, Mr Thomas ultimately accepted that this objection would be overcome by the provisions of s. 66 of the Act (upon which Ms Shead relied) providing of course that the pre-requisites to the application of that section were established.
	
	
	As the submissions developed, it was the position of both Mr Thomas and the Crown that the evidence, although relevant under s. 55 and admissible under s. 66 of the Act, should be excluded pursuant to the general discretion for which provision is made in s. 135 of the Act.
	
	
	Mr Thomas submitted, in particular, that because of the hearsay quality of the evidence, its self-serving nature and the terms in which it was expressed, its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of being unfairly prejudicial to Rogerson, and/or be misleading or confusing.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence was unfairly prejudicial to the Crown's case. The parties appeared to agree that in the event that I concluded that the evidence should be admitted, it would be necessary for me to give a warning as to the possible unreliability of the evidence to the jury pursuant to s. 165 of the Act.
	
	
	In R v Crisologo (1997) 99 A Crim R 178 Simpson J, with whom Hunt CJ at CL and James J agreed, made a number of observations as to the operation of s. 66 of the Act which, in my view, are apposite to the present circumstances. Her Honour observed, amongst other things, that s. 66 imposes two conditions before the exception to the hearsay rule for which it provides comes into effect. For present purposes, it is sufficient for me to note that there was no submission put to me by any party that those conditions were not met.
	
	
	Relevantly, her Honour went on to say this:
	


“Statements made by an accused person at a relevant (that is, early) time are, in my view, a precise counterpart of complaint made by an alleged victim in sexual assault (and other) cases. The Act draws no distinction between the admissibility of out of court statements made by a complainant, and a statement of a similar kind made by a person accused of crime.

The principles applicable to the admission of evidence of complaint apply equally to the admission of evidence of relevant out of court statements by an accused person at a time when the events the subject of the statement are fresh in his/her memory and when he/she has been or is to be called to give evidence. Such evidence, like evidence of complaint, is now admitted as evidence of the truth of what was said.”


	
	The evidence is clearly relevant to the issue of duress which is clearly going to be raised on behalf of the accused McNamara. The real question is whether or not it should be excluded on the basis that it could be said to be unfairly prejudicial to Rogerson and/or the Crown, or be misleading or confusing.
	
	
	Whilst the evidence may be prejudicial to Rogerson, and to some extent to the Crown, I am not satisfied that it is unfairly so. It is clearly relevant to the issue of duress to be raised by McNamara and I am not satisfied that the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice to either of those parties.
	
	
	Similarly, I am not satisfied that the evidence is likely to be misleading or confusing in any way. I reach that conclusion on the basis of the outline of the evidence which has been provided to me by Ms Shead. There is nothing at all misleading or confusing about its terms.
	
	
	As Simpson J pointed out in Crisologo (supra), it may well be that the jury will regard the evidence as being entirely self-serving, and that it is a version manufactured by McNamara following his arrest. As her Honour observed, evidence of an exculpatory account given after arrest and charge may be of very little weight indeed, particularly when it is given to by close relative. Conversely, the jury may take the view that there is such consistency in the evidence and that this consistency is beneficial to the case that McNamara seeks to make. In the end result, as her Honour observed, what weight the jury might attach to the evidence cannot be ascertained. However, that does not render the evidence unfairly prejudicial, nor does it render the evidence misleading or confusing. It simply highlights the fact that ultimately the evidence will fall to be assessed by the jury as the judges of the facts in this case.
	
	
	In all of those circumstances, I propose to allow the evidence. However, I will warn the jury, pursuant to s. 165 of the Act that this part of Ms McNamara’s evidence may be unreliable, and that such unreliability stems primarily from its hearsay quality.

2427360,Application by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police dated 10 March 2016 re matter 2015/371533 [2016] NSWSC 217,"Judgment


	
	These are proceedings for a restraining order under s 19 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth). That section provides that a Court must order that property must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with if the requirements of the section are satisfied.
	
	
	The first requirement is that the application be made by a proceeds of crime authority. The application in the present case is made by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and that entity is a proceeds of crime authority. The second requirement is that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence of the Commonwealth or are an instrument of a serious offence. The section provides, as an associated requirement that, the application for the restraining order must be supported by an affidavit of the authorised officer stating that officer suspects that the property is the proceeds of the offence or, if the offence is a serious offence, the property is an instrument of the offence. That affidavit must include the grounds on which the authorised officer holds the suspicion and the Court must be satisfied that the authorised officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion stated in the affidavit on reasonable grounds.
	
	
	I have read the affidavit of Anthony Hall affirmed 17 December 2015. Mr Hall is an authorised officer of the Australian Federal Police within the meaning of s 338. I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence under s 19(1)(d)(i) of the Act or an instrument of a serious offence under s 19(1)(d)(ii) of the Act. The offence concerned is an offence under s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), being an offence of dealing with money that is reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime and, at the time of dealing, the value of the money is $AUD100,000 or more. That offence is both an indictable offence and a serious offence for the purposes of the Act. I am satisfied from the information that is set out in Mr Hall's affidavit and the documents which form exhibit AH1 to that document that the suspicion held by Mr Hall is a reasonable one.
	
	
	Section 26 requires the giving of written notice to the owner of the property or to other persons whom the Commissioner reasonably believes may have an interest in the property. The three interested persons in this matter are Muhammad Kamran, Abdul Rehman and Brent Pickavance. I am satisfied from the affidavit evidence that notice has been given to those three persons.
	
	
	Mr Pickavance has appeared this morning. He has sought an adjournment in the matter for one week. His solicitor requested him to do so so that consent orders could be prepared in the matter. There does not appear to be any opposition from any person to the making of the restraining orders.
	
	
	No purpose would be achieved by adjourning the proceedings for one week so that a consent order could be made which, in any event, will concern one only of the interested persons. It will still be necessary for the Court to satisfy itself under s 19, at least, in respect of the other interested persons. For that reason, I decline to adjourn the proceedings.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the requirements of s 19 have been established. I note that the usual undertaking as to damages is given on behalf of the applicant I make orders in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of the short minutes of order. I stand the proceedings over before the Registrar to 16 June at 9.00am, liberty to restore on three days' notice and I direct the orders be entered forthwith.

2427362,R v Townsend [2016] NSWSC 218,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 9 March 2016 the accused, Brian Francis Townsend was arraigned in this Court on an indictment charging him with the murder of Mr George Cornell on 9 November 2014. To that charge he pleaded not guilty. In substance, although he admits that he killed Mr Cornell, intending to do so, the outstanding question is whether, at the time, he was mentally ill so as not to be responsible according to law for his actions. If so, then the appropriate verdict is a special verdict under s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) of “not guilty by virtue of mental illness”. Such a verdict, where found, empowers the Court to order that the person be detained until released by due process of law or to be released either conditionally or otherwise. An order for release cannot be made unless the Court is satisfied, in substance, that the safety of the person or the public will not be seriously endangered by the person’s release.
	
	
	The defence is made out if the Court is satisfied, more likely than not, that at the time of the offence he was suffering from a mental illness such that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. The test was explained by Sir Owen Dixon in his summing-up to the jury in a murder trial in Canberra in 1933, in which the issue was mental illness: The King v Porter (1936) 55 CLR 182. This has been applied in such trials in this State ever since. Speaking of the accused in that trial, His Honour said (at 189-90):
	


“... The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ""wrong""? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people.”

The facts


	
	The facts in this case are not in dispute. Indeed, an agreed statement of facts has been tendered with the concurrence of both the prosecution and defence which deals with the circumstances of Mr Cornell’s tragic death.
	
	
	At the time, the accused and the deceased were living in a block of units in Dubbo. Their units were on separate floors with access to each floor by stairs. There is a concrete landing area outside the accused’s unit and that is where the offence is alleged to have been committed. The two men had been friends for about 18 months, often drinking alcohol together, which sometimes led to arguments between them. In 2013 a personal violence order was issued against the accused in favour of Mr Cornell following an alleged assault upon him by the accused. That order was in force at the time Mr Cornell was killed, in terms that the accused be of good behaviour towards Mr Cornell, but it did not prohibit contact with him.
	
	
	On Friday 7 November 2014 the accused and Mr Cornell commenced drinking alcohol, at first separately in their own units. During the afternoon they met in the accused’s unit and continued drinking on the rear veranda. As it happened, at 5.15pm on that evening a support worker from Mission Australia went to the accused’s unit and spoke to him through the screen door. He did not notice anything out of the ordinary. The accused said he was going to watch the cricket that night and that George (George Cornell) had cooked him seafood.
	
	
	At about 11.30pm police were called to the unit complex in relation to a male that had been assaulted. The initial 000 call had come from the accused, who said that someone else had assaulted Mr Cornell. On arrival police noticed him standing near Mr Cornell, who was lying unconscious on the concrete landing outside the unit. He was covered in blood and clearly very seriously injured. The accused told police that he didn't know what had happened. An ambulance arrived soon after and Mr Cornell was taken to Dubbo Base Hospital.
	
	
	After the ambulance left, the accused, who was obviously affected by alcohol, told police that he punched and stomped on Mr Cornell’s head up to 30 times. He was arrested and taken to Dubbo Police Station.
	
	
	At the hospital Mr Cornell was diagnosed with multiple fractures to his skull. The accused was interviewed by police. His account of what happened is accepted as truthful. He told police, amongst other things –
	


“All I can remember is me and George standing outside me unit, ah getting into a big argument. And me started punching into him and him screaming out for help. And then me, I remember actually I do remember stomping on his head. And the voices in me head were just saying kill him, kill him. I was hearing voices at the time. And I was, they were just saying kill him, kill him, kill him. And I, I just kept stomping and stomping and stomping. And I don’t know what made me stop but something made me stop. And then when I did seen him in the pool of blood I rang the um, ambulance”.


	
	Shortly after 10.30pm a neighbour had heard a man yell out; “No, No, No”. It was very loud and sounded as if someone was terribly frightened. Another neighbour heard, at about 11 pm a male’s voice yelling out; “Shut up. I told you to shut up”. It was very loud and I heard it in my unit.” Neither could tell where the voice had come from.
	
	
	The accused had bruises and scratches on his knuckles, and his bare feet and clothing were blood stained with what DNA tests confirmed was Mr Cornell’s blood. Mr Cornell was pronounced dead in the early hours of 9 November. An autopsy found that death was caused by head injuries caused by blunt force trauma. There are details in the autopsy report about the extent of those injuries but it is not necessary to refer to them except to note that they confirmed multiple blows.
	


Mental health of the accused


	
	The accused was first diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia in 2003. He has extensive medical records detailing his diagnosis and treatment. Significantly, they include brain damage from a fall from the back of a moving utility when he was 21. He had earlier symptoms of psychosis, but there is little doubt that the brain injury contributed to his later bouts and ultimate schizophrenia. He has had numerous admissions to hospital for his mental symptoms, when he has self-harmed in significant ways and exhibited some paranoia. This history and his account of what he was experiencing at the time he killed Mr Cornell provides, together with their own clinical examinations, the material upon which the conclusions of the two psychiatrists, Dr Richard Furst and Dr Olav Nielssen are based.
	
	
	Dr Furst’s report includes a summary of the Accused’s lengthy history of mental health issues and treatment. Dr Furst considered that the accused “probably has enough cognitive capacity to follow what is said in court, notwithstanding his schizophrenic illness and some residual psychotic symptoms. His psychotic symptoms have improved somewhat over recent months.” He was therefore fit to be tried.
	
	
	As to the question of mental illness, Dr Furst’s opinion was:
	


“Although Mr Townsend was no doubt intoxicated at the time of the offence, he was also suffering from a defect of reason in the form of command auditory hallucinations telling him to kill his friend George. Although he was aware of his actions, he was probably unable to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense and composure. In my opinion he has the mental illness defence available to him.”


	
	Dr Olav Nielssen stated:
	


“I believe Mr Townsend is fit for trial as he understands the charges, the evidence against him, the general nature of the proceedings and has some knowledge of the procedure followed in court. He was assessed to be able to follow any proceedings, understand legal advice and provide reliable instructions to his legal representative.”


	
	So far as his mental illness is concerned, Dr Nielssen said:
	


“At the time of the offence, Mr Townsend reported an abnormality of mind in the form of commanding hallucinations of voices, arising from an underlying condition in the form of his chronic mental illness or neurological (meaning brain) injury. His symptoms affected his perception of events and his capacity to self-control. Mr Townsend’s behaviour was affected by self-induced intoxication with a very large quantity of alcohol, although his alcohol use was on the background of an underlying neurological injury.”

He went on to say:

“I concur with the opinion of Dr Furst regarding the availability of the defence of mental illness for this offence. Mr Townsend has a disease of the mind, in the form of either a chronic schizophrenic illness or hallucinations arising from an underlying brain injury. At the time of the offence he was affected by a defect of reason in the form of commanding hallucinations he felt compelled to obey. From his account of his behaviour it is clear that he was aware of the physical nature and quality of his actions. However, I believe at the time of the offence itself, Mr Townsend was unable to appreciate the moral wrongfulness of his actions as he reported he was unable to resist the voices he heard immediately before the offence or control his actions in the presence of that symptom.


	
	I should point out that hallucinatory voices are typical of schizophrenic illness and some other brain injuries. Regrettably, in a medical sense, there is nothing surprising or unusual about the commands that Mr Townsend heard, the tragedy is that they commanded extreme violence in circumstances where he was, because of his illness I am satisfied, unable to resist what was being told to him.”
	


Special verdict


	
	I am satisfied that it is appropriate to enter a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness.
	
	
	Although schizophrenia can, in many cases, be controlled by medications of various kinds and, indeed, the accused’s symptoms were to some degree moderated by his medication, he is medication resistant and cannot be released at large because it must be concluded that, if this were to happen, he would be not only a danger to members of the public but also to himself. Whether he can ultimately be released or placed in some less restrictive form of secure setting will be a matter for the Mental Health Review Tribunal, whose task it will be to monitor his progress.
	
	
	It is necessary to make an order for the detention of the accused under s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.
	
	
	I order that Mr Townsend be detained at the Long Bay Prison Hospital, or at such other place as may be determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal, until released by due process of the law. I recommend the transfer of Mr Townsend to the Forensic Hospital, Malabar as soon as practicable.
	
	
	I express my deepest sympathy to the family, relatives, and friends of George Cornell in their loss.

2427382,Regina v Xiao [2016] NSWSC 240,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

(A) THE CHARGES


	
	Hui (also known as Steven) Xiao has pleaded guilty to two rolled-up insider trading offences together with another rolled-up insider trading offence which is to be taken into account pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). In relation to the charges I shall refer to all of the offences in these Remarks on Sentence as “the insider trading offences”.
	
	
	The first rolled-up charge, Charge 1, has, for reasons which will become apparent, been classified as the “Hu and Market Star Offending”. The second rolled-up charge, Charge 2, relates to what has been referred to as the “Wingatta Offending”. The matters to be taken into account pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act in relation to Charge 1, have been referred to as the “Gold Pattern Offending”.
	
	
	The offender, in relation to each of these three categories of offending, was charged with insider trading offences contrary to the provisions of s 1043A(1)(d) and s 1311(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
	
	
	At the time of the offending, the offences carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty was increased from 5 years to 10 years imprisonment with effect from 13 December 2010.
	
	
	The offender committed the insider trading offences through or in his role as the Managing Director of an Australian company, Hanlong Mining Investment Pty Ltd (Hanlong Mining) an Australian subsidiary of a Chinese conglomerate Sichuan Hanlong Group Co Ltd (Sichuan Hanlong). Both insider trading offences involved total investments by him of AU$2,003,605 and a total personal profit of AU$1,506,669 with a further investment by him of $282,034 and a profit of $206,146 (the Gold Pattern Offending) through a company with which the offender was closely associated.
	
	
	The insider trading offences the subject of Charge 1 and Charge 2 were committed between 1 and 15 July 2011 in connection with two Australian companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (the ASX) that were at the relevant times takeover targets of Hanlong Mining, namely, Bannerman Resources Ltd (Bannerman) and Sundance Resources Ltd (Sundance).
	
	
	The particulars in relation to Charges 1 and 2 and the scheduled offence were summarised in the Crown’s submissions at [11] in the following terms:
	


“Charge 1: Hu and Market Star Offending

a)   Between 4 and 15 July 2011, the Offender procured his wife Xike Hu (Ms Hu) to acquire 266,500 CFDs relating to Bannerman and 6,700,000 CFDs relating to Sundance, in 35 separate transactions, by controlling and operating her trading account, contrary to s 1043A(1)(d) of the Corporations Act (the Hu Offending).

b)   Between 13 and 15 July 2011, the Offender procured his personal company Market Star Ltd (Market Star) to acquire 1,320,000 shares in Sundance, in three separate transactions, by controlling and operating its trading account, contrary to s 1043A(1)(d) of the Corporations Act (the Market Star Offending).

Charge 2: Wingatta Offending

c)   Between 6 and 15 July 2011, the Offender entered into an agreement with Mr Zhu and two other Hanlong Mining executives to commit insider trading offences using a joint investment vehicle called Wingatta Ltd (Wingatta), and offences of that type were committed in accordance with the agreement, namely Mr Zhu by controlling and operating its trading accounts procured Wingatta to acquire 1,252,753 shares in Bannerman and 10,112,154 CFDs relating to Sundance, in 27 separate transactions, contrary to s 1043A(1)(d) of the Corporations Act and s 11.2A of the Criminal Code (the Wingatta Offending).

Scheduled offence: Gold Pattern Offending

d)   Between 1 and 8 July 2011, the Offender procured a company with which he was closely associated, Gold Pattern Ltd (Gold Pattern), to acquire 1,316,327 CFDs relating to Bannerman, in 37 separate transactions, contrary to s 1043A(1)(d) of the Corporations Act (the Gold Pattern Offending).


	
	This summary of the offences is based upon an Agreed Statement of Facts which was tendered at the sentencing hearing and marked as Exhibit A.
	
	
	The relevant offences comprise a total of 65 separate contraventions under the Corporations Act and the Criminal Code.
	
	
	The offender commenced his employment as the Managing Director of Hanlong Mining in June 2009. He was also employed as the CEO of Hanlong Resources Ltd (Hanlong Resources), which was another subsidiary of Sichuan Hanlong based in Hong Kong, from September 2010.
	
	
	At the time of the insider trading offences he had experience in trading in various financial products including shares and CFDs and he controlled and operated share and CFD trading accounts in his own name.
	
	
	The parent company of Hanlong Mining, Sichuan Hanlong, had businesses in China, Hong Kong, Australia, the United States, Canada and the British Virgin Islands. They included mining, energy, real estate properties, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals and technology.
	
	
	Hanlong Mining was incorporated in Australia in September 2009 and it sought overseas investment opportunities in the mining industry on behalf of Sichuan Hanlong.
	
	
	As Managing Director, the offender had the role of identifying possible opportunities for investment in the mining industry for Sichuan Hanlong and to make recommendations to it in relation to possible acquisitions.
	
	
	He had authority to make most day-to-day business decisions by Hanlong Mining. However, investment decisions had to be approved by senior officers of the parent company, in particular, Mr Kang and Mr Liu, respectively, the Vice President and Chairman of the parent company.
	
	
	Employees at Hanlong Mining reported to the offender and received instructions from him. These included Mr Zhu, Mr Yang and Mr Chen. The offender received remuneration by way of salary from Hanlong Mining and Hanlong Resources amounting to over AU$900,000 in the 2010-2011 year.
	
	
	The offender exploited inside information which included highly confidential information concerning the two separate takeover targets of Hanlong Mining, both of which were publicly listed Australian companies (Bannerman Resources Ltd and Sundance Resources Ltd).
	
	
	Prior to the announcement of each takeover offer, which included a premium on the prevailing share price of each company, the offender procured various trading accounts in the names of third parties to acquire shares and CFDs in Bannerman and Sundance.
	
	
	Following the announcement of each takeover offer on the ASX the share prices for Bannerman and Sundance increased and the offender immediately caused the shares and contracts for different (CFDs) to be sold for a profit.
	
	
	The offender used trading accounts in the name of his personal company, his wife, and a joint investment vehicle to acquire shares and CFDs in Bannerman and Sundance prior to the announcement of the takeover proposals.
	
	
	The trading accounts used by him were in the names of the following:
	



	
	The offender’s personal company, which was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, namely Market Star Limited (Market Star);
	
	
	The offender’s wife’s account, that is Ms Hu’s account; and
	
	
	A joint investment vehicle, Wingatta Limited (Wingatta), which had been funded by the offender and other executives of Hanlong Mining (namely, Mr Zhu, Mr Chen and Mr Yang) and was an Australian subsidiary of a Hong Kong holding company.
	



	
	A summary of the offending by the offender, including the number of trades, the financial products, investment and profit details were also set out in the form of a schedule provided by the Crown, Annexure A to the Outline of Crown’s Submissions on Sentence dated 8 December 2015. A copy of the schedule will be attached to the written version of these Remarks on Sentence.
	
	
	The ASIC investigation into the insider trading offences commenced on or about 21 July 2011.
	
	
	On 13 September 2011, the offender travelled to Hong Kong by virtue of a variation of orders made by this Court which had prevented him from departing Australia. He returned after attending to a permanent residency application.
	
	
	On 17 November 2011, he again applied to this Court for orders permitting him to travel to China to complete a doctoral thesis exam. The order was made requiring him to return to Australia by 26 November 2011.
	
	
	On 21 November 2011, he departed Australia for Beijing via Hong Kong. In contravention of the order of this Court he failed to voluntarily return to Australia. Information obtained by ASIC indicated that he had not attended to complete his doctoral thesis.
	
	
	From April 2012 he changed his name and obtained employment in Hong Kong under the name “Eric Xiao Jiayi”.
	
	
	On 12 January 2014, he was arrested entering Hong Kong from China under a provisional arrest warrant and was held in custody from that date.
	
	
	On 17 September 2014, following a contested extradition hearing, an order was made for the offender to be surrendered to Australia in respect of the then allegations of contraventions of the insider trading provisions of the Corporations Act.
	
	
	He was extradited to Australia on 9 October 2014 and he has been held in custody in Australia since his arrival on 10 October 2014.
	


Rolled-Up Charges


	
	I have earlier referred to the fact that Charges 1 and 2 are rolled-up charges. This means that each involves more than one episode of criminal conduct during the relevant period. It means that the criminality involved is greater than a charge involving only one episode of criminal conduct.
	
	
	On sentencing it is still necessary for the Court to assess the criminality of the offender’s conduct within each rolled-up count. The Court is to have regard to the criminality as disclosed by each charge, not the number of counts: R v Knight [2004] NSWCCA 145 at [25]-[26].
	
	
	The principal limitation is the single maximum penalty for what might otherwise have been separate instances of offending within each rolled-up count.
	
	
	In the Crown’s Written Submissions it was noted at [17] that in this case it is relevant that each charge includes the use of inside information relating to two distinct corporate takeovers, as well as numerous separate transactions on multiple days, utilising both shares and CFDs, through different trading accounts.
	


(B) FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDING CONDUCT

Inside Information in the Possession of the Offender


	
	The offender became possessed of the inside information the subject of the charges concerning takeover proposals to be made by Hanlong Mining with respect, as I have indicated, to the companies Bannerman and Sundance. The offender as Managing Director had a direct involvement in negotiations, strategy and discussions concerning the takeover offers by Hanlong Mining with respect to both Bannerman and Sundance. The inside information in relation to each was, of course, highly sensitive and confidential information as the offender appreciated. The inside information, in other words, was not generally available and if it had been generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of Bannerman and Sundance shares and CFDs.
	


The Bannerman Proposal


	
	Mr Zhu, whilst consulting with the offender, prepared and assisted in the preparation of a number of presentations and documents in relation to Hanlong Mining’s investment strategy with respect to Bannerman.
	
	
	A number of meetings and discussions took place between officers of Hanlon Mining and Bannerman between December 2010 and July 2011. The offender was centrally involved with such discussions, meetings and negotiations concerning the proposed takeover.
	
	
	On Monday 11 July 2011, Bannerman issued a public ASX announcement that Bannerman had received a highly conditional takeover proposal from Hanlong Mining.
	
	
	When trading on the ASX resumed, the price of Bannerman shares rose.
	


Sundance


	
	Hanlong Mining was interested in investing in Australian iron ore companies and in or about August 2010 the senior management of Sichuan Hanlong became interested in Sundance. Mr Liu of Sichuan Hanlong directed the offender, who in turn directed Mr Zhu, to prepare an iron ore strategy paper. A number of meetings and negotiations thereafter took place. The offender was directly involved in those negotiations and the formulation of strategy which eventually led to a takeover offer being made.
	
	
	On 15 July 2011, following a discussion with the offender, Mr Zhu, on behalf of Hanlong Mining, sent Sundance a conditional proposal to acquire 100% of the company through a Scheme of Arrangement. The actual proposal to acquire Sundance was consistent with the Sundance inside information possessed by the offender prior to the announcement of the proposal on 18 July 2011.
	
	
	On 18 July 2011, Sundance issued a public ASX announcement to advise that Sundance had received a conditional takeover proposal from Hanlong Mining.
	
	
	Following the announcement, the price of Sundance shares rose.
	


The Hu and Market Star Offending: Charge 1


	
	On 30 March 2011, an account was opened in the name of the offender’s then wife with IG Markets (the Hu Trading Account). At all relevant times the offender was the person controlling and operating the Hu trading account. Mrs Hu had no involvement and referred all enquiries relating to that account to the offender.
	


(a) Bannerman Trades – Charge 1


	
	On 4 and 5 July 2011, the offender procured 11 separate orders on the Hu Trading Account, executed immediately, to acquire a total of 266,500 Bannerman CFDs for a total investment outlay of $31,303 (with an underlying leveraged exposure of $79,825).
	
	
	On 11 July 2011, the day trading resumed after the announcement of the proposed takeover of Bannerman by Hanlong Mining, the offender procured 8 separate orders on the Hu Trading Account to dispose of the 266,500 Bannerman CFDs at prices between $0.475 and $0.485 per share. At the time of the disposal, the underlying leveraged exposure had increased to $128,102 and it resulted in a gross profit of $48,277.
	


(b) The Sundance Trades – Charge 1


	
	On 13 and 15 July 2011, the offender procured 24 separate orders on the Hu Trading Account, executed immediately to acquire a total of 6,700,000 Sundance CFDs priced between $0.345 and $0.405 per share, involving a total investment outlay of $713,619 (with an underlying leveraged exposure of $2,571,250).
	
	
	On 18 July 2011, the offender procured 7 separate orders on the Hu Trading Account to dispose of the 6,700,000 Sundance CFDs. At the time of the disposal, the underlying leveraged exposure had increased to $3,239,320 resulting in a gross profit of $668,070.
	
	
	Between 13-15 July 2011, the offender procured three separate orders on the Market Star Trading Account to acquire 1,320,000 Sundance shares for a total investment outlay of $476,600 and which, on 18 July 2011, produced a personal gross profit of $157,000.
	


Sundance


	
	The offender and Zhu were engaged, as I have indicated, in discussions, negotiations and strategy issues in the events leading up to the acquisition of Sundance. In particular:
	



	
	From around September 2010, the offender and Mr Zhu, on behalf of Hanlong Mining, worked towards the acquisition of Sundance. The work included loan applications and applications to the relevant authorities in China and Australia and presentations to Sichuan Hanlong and its senior management.
	
	
	In November 2010, an initial offer to purchase the Talbot Group’s holding in Sundance was made by letter drafted by Mr Zhu, approved by the offender and signed by the offender on behalf of Hanlong Mining.
	
	
	In March 2011, negotiations to purchase the Talbot Group’s holding were undertaken by the offender and Mr Zhu at which time they travelled to Canada.
	
	
	On 16 March 2011, Mr Zhu drafted a Letter of Offer on behalf of Hanlong Mining in respect of an offer to purchase the Talbot Group stake in Sundance. The Letter of Offer was only sent once the offender had considered it. He told Zhu to send it on behalf of Hanlong Mining (the offer made was slightly in excess of the offer referred to in the draft letter prepared by Zhu): Agreed Facts at [63].
	
	
	On 17 March 2011, following acceptance by the Talbot Group of the offer made by Hanlong Mining, Zhu reported the same to the offender: Agreed Facts at [64].
	
	
	On or about 20 April 2011, at a meeting of the board of Sichuan Hanlong, the offender, not Zhu, gave a presentation to the Sichuan Hanlong board: Agreed Facts at [66].
	
	
	In May 2011, further contact was made by Hanlong Mining to Sundance; a further investment was instigated by the offender with Zhu making contact to discuss the possibility: Agreed Fact at [76].
	
	
	In mid-June 2011, Zhu had direct responsibility for the Sundance project’s due diligence: Agreed Facts at [70].
	
	
	On 11 July 2011, a further meeting was held in China at Sichuan Hanlong. At that meeting the offender presented a paper that had been prepared by Mr Zhu.
	
	
	In July 2011, in relation to the proposed acquisition of 100% of Sundance, Zhu discussed the proposal with the offender and it was following discussion with him, that an unconditional proposal to acquire 100% of the company was sent.
	


Wingatta Offending: Charge 2


	
	In relation to the Wingatta Offending relevant to Charge 2, the evidence supports the proposition that the offender took and assumed a dominant role. According to the Agreed Facts, in June or July 2010, the offender told Zhu that Mr Liu was supportive of officers in Hanlong Mining “co-investing” in securities of companies in which Hanlong Mining was considering acquiring an interest: Agreed Facts at [92]. There is, however, no evidence that independently supports the proposition that Mr Liu in fact told the offender, or made any statement to him, supportive of executives “co-investing”.
	
	
	In December 2010, it was the offender who reached an agreement with Zhu, Chen and Yang, to invest in a joint fund for profit, namely, Wingatta: Agreed Facts at [93]. Thereafter, consistent with that agreement, Wingatta was used as the investment vehicle: Agreed Facts at [94].
	
	
	In January 2011, the following funds were transferred to Golden Stone and then to Wingatta and companies in the British Virgin Islands with accounts controlled by each of the offender, Zhu, Yang and Chen in the following amounts:
	



	
	AU$700,000 from the offender.
	
	
	AU$300,000 from Zhu.
	
	
	AU$300,00 from Yang.
	
	
	AU$100,000 from Chen.
	



	
	On 15 March 2011, the offender invested a further AU$100,000 in Wingatta increasing its total funds at that time to AU$1.5m: Agreed Facts at [96].
	


Facts and Circumstances: The Agreed Facts (Exhibit A)


	
	The particular facts and circumstances, as concerns the offender, are set out in the detailed Agreed Statement of Facts (Exhibit A). On an examination and analysis of the facts set out in Exhibit A, the following matters are apparent:
	



	
	In relation to Charge 1 and Charge 2, it is to be noted that in relation to the first charge (involving the Hu and Market Star Offending), the offender acted alone and for his own personal benefit. In relation to Charge 2 (involving the Wingatta Offending), he was part of a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Zhu and two other executives of Hanlong Mining. His role, activities and associated aspects of his participation in relation to the Charge 2 offending are matters of central importance in relation to his sentencing for that charge.
	
	
	The offender’s personal investment in relation to Charge 1 (Hu and Market Star Offending) was $1,221,522. His personal investment in relation to Charge 2 (Wingatta Offending) was $782,081. His combined personal investment in relation to Charges 1 and 2 therefore was $2,003,603.
	
	
	The offender’s personal profit in relation to Charge 1 was $873,347. His personal profit in relation to Charge 2 was $633,320. His combined personal profit from Charges 1 and 2 was therefore $1,506,667.
	



	
	Both the amounts invested and the profits made by the offender were, as the Crown submitted, at the high end of the scale for offending of the kind in question, both in absolute terms and as compared to other cases of insider trading in Australia to date.
	
	
	The offender’s confidence in investing the amounts that he did, in particular in relation to Sundance and Bannerman, was plainly borne of a belief, based upon his access to highly material inside information, that the investments were close to having a certain outcome.
	
	
	Both the amounts invested and his underlying leveraged exposure, the latter being $2,651,075 in relation to the acquisition of CFDs in relation to Charge 1, and $3,849,814 in relation to Charge 2, also evidence a powerful profit motive.
	
	
	I accept, as the Crown submitted, that both the offender’s personal investment and the level of profits derived by him are material factors. The offender’s total personal profit in relation to Charges 1 and 2 was just over $1.5 million ($1,506,669). His personal profit-making was the result of a planned and strategic exploitation of his position of trust as Managing Director of Hanlong Mining.
	
	
	There are certain additional matters to be noted concerning the funding of Wingatta’s Bannerman share‑trading, being part of the offending the subject of Charge 2, and its acquisition of CFDs in relation to Sundance, the other part of the offending under Charge 2.
	
	
	The offender was involved in obtaining a transfer of US$1 million from a related entity of Hanlong Mining, for the sole purpose of allowing Wingatta to illegally trade in Bannerman shares.
	
	
	The profit made by Wingatta over the period 6-8 July 2011, with the offender’s agreement was used by it in the period 13-15 July 2011 to fund the acquisition by it of 10,112,154 CFDs with respect to Sundance.
	
	
	The securing and use of the US$1 million obtained from a related entity of Hanlong Mining in order to fund Wingatta’s acquisition of Bannerman financial products (Wingatta then having insufficient funds of its own) was, based on the Agreed Facts, a highly unusual and irregular arrangement. The intention shared by the offender, Zhu and Yang to deploy the US$1 million in funding the acquisition of financial products in Bannerman, is an aggravating factor that is to be taken into account on sentencing.
	
	
	In the written submissions for the offender, it was contended that Mr Liu of Sichuan Hanlong had full knowledge and approved the loan to be used for the purpose for which it was used. However, the Agreed Facts do not support that submission. In his oral submissions, Mr Ramage accepted that there was no evidence on this aspect in the Agreed Facts: 14 December 2015 at T 18:45-50. He later stated that it was a matter of inference: T:19:40-45. On the basis of the Agreed Facts no inference, in my assessment, can be drawn to that effect.
	
	
	For the offender, as Managing Director of a corporation, along with other executives, to devise and utilise such a scheme by which they could fund their own personal acquisition of financial products whilst using insider information specifically to advance their personal interests, is a demonstration both of a high-handed mentality in the offender whilst acting in gross breach of his position of trust and as to the level of criminality involved.
	
	
	In relation to the Wingatta charge (Charge 2), as the offender was part of a joint criminal enterprise with Zhu and another two executives, the Crown submitted as follows:
	


“It is necessary to determine, to the extent possible, the role of the Offender and what he actually did in furtherance of the enterprise, including:

a)   Whether the Offender was the instigator or dominant figure in the offending.

b)   The degree of planning engaged in by the Offender.

c)   His knowledge of and participation in the illegal conduct.

d)   His benefit from the crime.”


	
	I consider that the Agreed Facts (Exhibit A) deal with each of these matters.
	
	
	As Managing Director the offender was present and he participated with Zhu, Chen and Yang in discussions to arrange the US$1 million loan from the Hanlong Mining related entity to enable Wingatta to acquire the financial products in Bannerman, it being noted in such discussions that “Hanlong Mining would soon submit a takeover offer for Bannerman … [that] they could use that chance to get their money back …”: Agreed Statement of Facts at [100].
	
	
	The evidence establishes that the offender played a central role as a principal in what was a joint criminal enterprise. As such, whilst Managing Director of Hanlong Mining he approved the enterprise and directed and participated in its execution.
	
	
	It is clear that there was significant planning of the enterprise involving the offender acting with full knowledge of the illegal nature of his conduct in acquiring Bannerman and Sundance financial products. Wingatta had been set up as an investment vehicle by agreement between the offender, Zhu, Yang and Chen: Agreed Facts at [94]. The offender was intended to be one of those who would benefit from the joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	As Managing Director he was at all material times in a superior position in Hanlong Mining to Zhu, Yang and Chen. He was the most senior member of that company and assumed an ongoing involvement in negotiations and deliberations regarding takeover offers, as I have earlier indicated. At a time when he was directly involved in the takeover negotiations he gave his approval to recapitalising Wingattta by the US$1 million loan which was then used as a means for achieving his illegal objective.
	
	
	The evidence establishes that he did play a dominant role in the joint criminal enterprise and I so find.
	


Planned and Premeditated Conduct


	
	The amounts invested by the offender reflect, as I have indicated, a high level of confidence in him with which he acted, based upon his perception that the investments made carried virtually no risk. That, of course, arose by reason of his carefully planned and premeditated conduct which was driven by a dishonest intent utilising insider information of a very high quality and value.
	
	
	The offender’s attempts to disguise his criminal activities associated with the insider trading offences, by utilising various accounts as a form of disguise, is, of course, evidence itself of a guilty state of mind. His attempts to conceal his involvement in procuring illegal trades additionally should be regarded as an aggravating feature of the case.
	


(C) SENTENCING PROVISIONS


	
	The offender is to be sentenced in accordance with the provisions of Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Division 2 of Part 1B of the Act sets out general sentencing principles. Section 16A(1) of that Act provides that in determining the sentence to be passed in respect of any person for a federal offence, the Court must impose a sentence, or make an order, that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.
	
	
	Section 16A(2) provides, that in addition to any other matters, the Court must take into account such of the matters as specified in s 16A(2) as are relevant and known to the Court. These include:
	


(a)   The nature and circumstances of the offence;

(b)   Other offences (if any) that are required or permitted to be taken into account;

(c)   If the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or similar character – that course of conduct.

(d)   …

(e)   …

(f)   The degree to which the person has shown contrition for the offence:

(i)   by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; or

(ii)   in any other manner;

(fa)   …

(g)   If the person has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the offence – that fact;

(h)   The degree to which the person has co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or similar offences;

(j)   The deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have on the person;

(ja)   The deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have on other persons;

(k)   The need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence;

…


	
	Other matters include the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person, the prospects of rehabilitation and the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on the person’s family or dependants.
	
	
	The Court is not to pass a sentence of imprisonment unless, having considered all other available sentences, it is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case: s 17A.
	
	
	Part 1B accordingly provides the fundamental starting point for the sentencing for a federal offence: Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2 at [25].
	
	
	In the present case the offender procured a large number of trades whilst in possession of inside information, thereby committing multiple contraventions of the prohibition contained in s 1043A(1)(d) in Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act.
	
	
	It is well accepted that the criminalisation of insider trading plays a significant role in supporting the objectives set out in Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act which includes the promotion of confident and informed decision-making by consumers of financial products and the promotion of fair, orderly and transparent markets for financial products: see Joffe v R; Stromer v R (2012) 82 NSWLR 510; [2012] NSWCCA 277 at [34].
	
	
	It has been observed in a number of cases that a person who commits insider trading possesses an unfair advantage against legitimate investors in the market. It has been observed that insider trading is a form of cheating or fraud: R v Glynatsis (2013) 230 A Crim R 99; [2013] NSWCCA 131 at [79].
	
	
	It has also been recognised that insider trading erodes public confidence in the fair, orderly and transparent operation of the market: R v Rivkin (2004) 59 NSWLR 284; [2004] NSWCCA 7 at [412].
	
	
	As the Crown submitted, because of the need to protect the integrity of the market and the Australian economy generally, insider trading has been described as a serious criminal offence: R v Zhu (2013) NSWSC 127 at [18]; DPP (Cth) v Hill and Kamay [2015] VSC 86 at [46]; R v Joffe; R v Stromer (2015) 106 ACSR 255; [2015] NSWSC 741 at [97]; Kamay v R [2015] VSCA 296 at [52].
	
	
	In the present case the Crown further submitted that, based on the offender’s position, the scale of the trading that he procured, the high quality of the inside information, the exploitation of two separate takeover announcements concerning publicly listed Australian companies, the use of leveraged products to maximise profits and the attempts at concealment that the offender’s conduct represents an extremely serious breach of the statutory prohibition on insider trading: Crown’s Submissions at [26]. The facts set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts (Exhibit A), in my assessment, provide a sound foundation for that submission.
	


(D) MAXIMUM PENALTY


	
	The maximum penalty an insider trading offence, as the Crown noted, is the highest available in the Corporations Act and that that is a further indication of the seriousness with which this type of offending is regarded by the legislature.
	
	
	As earlier noted, in recent years, Parliament effectively doubled the maximum penalty for an offence under the insider trading provisions to 10 years. In R v De Silva (2011) 84 ACSR 240; [2011] NSWSC 243 at [57], Buddin J observed:
	


“[T]he legislature has recently seen fit to dramatically increase the maximum penalty which is available to be imposed upon such offenders. That, in turn, is likely to produce more severe penalties, everything else being equal, than those which have hitherto been imposed.”


	
	As the High Court has observed, judges need sentencing yardsticks and that it is well accepted that the maximum sentence available may in some cases be a matter of great relevance: Markarian v R [2005] 228 CLR 357 at [30].
	
	
	The High Court in that case also observed that careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, first, because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time; and thirdly, because in that regard they do provide, taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors, a yardstick: at [31].
	


(E) PRINCIPLES

Objective Seriousness of the Offences


	
	It is well accepted that, generally speaking, insider trading is not a “victimless crime”; it is a serious criminal offence as I have already indicated. Insider trading not only has the capacity to undermine the integrity of the market, but it also has the potential to undermine aspects of confidence in the commercial world generally: Hartman v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2011] NSWCCA 261 at [94]. Insider trading has the capacity to undermine, to a significant extent, the integrity and the efficacy of markets: R v Joffe (2015) 106 ACSR 525 at [97] per RA Hulme J. As his Honour observed, nothing less than strict conformity to the exacting standards of honesty are expected and required of persons who receive prior sensitive information.
	
	
	The amounts invested, and the amount of personal profit obtained from the offender’s insider trading, were substantial. The particular values of each of the rolled‑up charges are among many considerations relevant to determining the seriousness of the offending: Kamay v R [2015] VSCA 296 at [28].
	
	
	The objective gravity of the insider trading offences may be determined by reference to a number of other factors. These include, in the present case, as I have stated, the position of the offender as Managing Director and the steps he took to disguise the transactions and, additionally, the amounts invested and the anticipated gain: Director of Public Prosecutions v O’Reilly [2010] VSC 138 at [18].
	
	
	The offender’s role and responsibilities as Managing Director, included his direct involvement in the takeover offers, as I have indicated. The fact that he was well aware that he was improperly using highly sensitive and confidential information for his own personal gain is a matter of particular importance in assessing the gravity of his offences. His extreme breach of trust, occurring in those circumstances is in itself also a most important consideration that elevates the gravity of the offences to a very high level.
	
	
	Profit is a relevant factor to be taken into account in determining the objective seriousness but in most situations the better indicator of the extent of the criminality must be said to be the size of the transaction and the best way of assessing that is by reference to the amount of money invested or placed at risk: Glynatsis [2013] NSWCCA 131 at [54] per Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Rothman and McCallum JJ agreed).
	
	
	In this respect the amounts of money invested by an offender, and the level of profits made, will often vary significantly from case to case. In Kamay, supra, the leveraged nature of the margin FX contracts meant that the offender in that case only needed to invest a relatively small amount of his own money to make very substantial profits or losses: per Hollingworth J at [55].
	
	
	In the present case the offender, as earlier noted, expended very significant amounts of money in the purchase of shares and the acquisition of CFDs. The offender’s insider trading offences, as I have indicated, involved total combined personal investments of $2,003,605 with a further investment of $282,034 through the company with which he was closely associated.
	
	
	The Victorian Court of Appeal in Kamay, endorsed the observation that sometimes profit will loom large in the sentencing exercise, as for example, where it is the result of relatively small investments in highly leveraged financial products in order to obtain disproportionately large profits: at [37]. In cases such as the present, where attempts are made to maximise profit through the use of leveraged products such as CFDs, an offender need only pay a fraction of the value of the underlying shares to obtain the full benefit of the expected change in price: DPP v O’Reilly [2010] VSC 138 at [24].
	
	
	Viewed in this light, it was the Crown’s submission that both the amounts invested and the profits made by the offender were at the highest end of the scale, in absolute terms but also when compared to other cases of insider trading in Australia to date: Written Submissions at [65]. The Crown produced a schedule of other relevant cases as part of its submissions to which I have had reference.
	
	
	The circumstances within which substantial profits were ultimately made are also a relevant factor. In the present case, the use of direct and actual knowledge of the imminent takeover offers relevant to both Charge 1 and Charge 2 are circumstances that increase the objective seriousness of the offences.
	
	
	Associated with the lastmentioned factor, the nature and the value of the inside information which enabled the offender to obtain substantial profits over a quite small period of time is also an important determinant as referred to in Kamay v R, supra, at [32].
	
	
	The significance of general deterrence in sentencing for insider trading offences has been the subject of consideration in many cases: R v Rivkin (2003) 198 ALR 400 at [44]; [2003] NSWSC 447 per Johnson J; Khoo v R [2013] NSWCCA 323 at [2]-[5], [22]; R v Glynatsis [2012] NSWSC 1551 at [140].
	
	
	In order to give practical effect to the above principles, it has been observed that the “real bite” of general deterrence only takes hold when a custodial sentence is imposed: R v Hinchcliffe [2013] NSWCCA 327 at [276]-[278]. As the Crown observed, beyond the mere fact of a custodial sentence, general deterrence requires the Court to consider both the term of any sentence and the time to be actually served in custody: R v Hill; R v Kamay [2015] VSC 86 at [93] (the decision in that case was upheld by the Victorian Court of Appeal; Kamay v R [2015] VSCA 296).
	


(F) HIGH LEVEL SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCES


	
	The Crown submitted that the offender’s conduct in this matter is one of the most serious instances of insider trading in Australia to date. In summary, the insider trading offences committed by the offender are serious examples of such offending for the following reasons:
	



	
	The charges both involved rolled-up charges involving multiple episodes of criminal conduct;
	
	
	Charges 1 and 2 involved the offender’s use of highly confidential information in relation to takeover offers for his own benefit and in gross breach of trust.
	
	
	The evidence establishes, to the requisite standard, that the offender knew that he possessed and controlled highly material inside information that was not generally available to the market, and that he was fully aware that his conduct was wrong, dishonest and contrary to law.
	
	
	The evidence includes the fact that in addition to being directly involved in confidential negotiations and other matters, as I have indicated, in relation to the two companies, he was signatory to a confidentiality agreement in relation to the negotiations with Sundance and was party to discussions concerning similar arrangements in relation to Bannerman. Further, he was fully aware of the confidential and sensitive nature of the information and adopted the strategy of using third-party accounts, as I have indicated, as a disguise.
	
	
	The offender used the inside information to engage in a total of 65 separate contraventions under the Corporations Act 2001;
	
	
	The offences the subject of the charges, and the offending to be taken into account under s 16BA, were carefully planned and premeditated;
	
	
	The insider trading information obtained and utilised, as I have indicated, was in fact of high quality. It has been observed that a high degree of materiality of inside information would generally lead to a finding of greater objective seriousness; a low degree of materiality might, but not necessarily, lead to a finding of lower objective seriousness; and knowledge by the offender of the degree of materiality bears on the issue of moral culpability: R v Joffe per RA Hulme J at [98]-[99].
	
	
	The monies invested by the offender involved large sums of money, as I have indicated, in excess of $2,200,000.
	
	
	The leveraged nature of CFDs assisted in making the substantial profits.
	
	
	The fact that the offender made a personal profit from the activities the subject of the two charges of approximately $1.5 million.
	
	
	The motivation of the offender in committing the subject offences was personal greed.
	



	
	These matters place the objective seriousness of the offences in the high range of seriousness for such offences.
	


(G) THE OTHER OFFENCES TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT: S 16A(2)(b)


	
	As earlier indicated, the Gold Pattern Offending was placed on a s 168A of the Crimes Act schedule and needs to be taken into account when sentencing for Charge 1, being the Hu and Market Star Offending.
	
	
	The relevant principles to be applied to a scheduled offence were stated by Spigelman CJ in Attorney-General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1991 (No 1 of 2002) (2002) 137 A Crim R 180; [2002] NSWCCA 518 at [38].
	
	
	It was there observed that the entire point of the process of taking scheduled offences into account is to impose a longer sentence than would otherwise have been imposed if the primary offence or offences had stood alone. Although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. There are two elements: personal deterrence and the community’s entitlement to exact retribution for serious offences.
	
	
	With the scheduled offence the court is sentencing, of course, only for the principal offence or offences. On the facts concerning the scheduled offence in the present case, the Crown noted that the Gold Pattern Offending represented 23% of the total investment and profit the subject of the Hu and Market Star Offending. Also, it involved the additional procurement of trades by another corporate vehicle based in the British Virgin Islands. The offender had a close connection to the entity, Gold Pattern, its bank account, its trading account and the use of its funds.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that in the circumstances in which the Statement of Agreed Facts by the offender does not include details of the Gold Pattern Offending or how he procured the trades, his admission to procuring identified the particular facts supporting these matters in its Written Submissions at [89a]-[89g].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that in the circumstances in which the Statement of Facts as agreed by the offender does not include details of the Gold Pattern Offending, or how he procured the trades, his admission to procuring Gold Pattern in an unspecified way may be used as demonstrating only limited contrition and acceptance of responsibility.
	


(H) FURTHER MATTERS TO WHICH THE COURT IS TO HAVE REGARD WHEN PASSING SENTENCE: SECTION 16A(1)(2)

Section 16A(2)(c)


	
	In relation to the issue as to a course of conduct in terms of s 16A(2)(c) of the Crimes Act, I accept, as the Crown observed, that the offending cannot be regarded as a single course of conduct for the reason that it involved quite distinct personal trading as well as separate joint criminal enterprise. However, that said, the two charges do involve significant rolling-up of numerous separate contraventions.
	


The Issue of Contrition: Section 16A(2)(f) of the Crimes Act, and Plea of Guilty: Section 16A(2)(g) of the Crimes Act


	
	The fact that the offender entered a guilty plea may itself be taken as evidence of contrition. However, as the Crown observed, the plea must be taken having regard to other relevant matters. These include the extent to which a guilty plea may demonstrate contrition in the context of the strength of the Crown case and the fact that the offender has not otherwise expressed any contrition or remorse for his offending. I will refer shortly to other evidence relied upon in this case as evidencing contrition or remorse. I accept, of course, the Crown submission in that respect. And it is clear, in my assessment, that the Crown case was indeed a very strong one.
	
	
	The utilitarian discount identified in the guideline judgment in R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 does not apply to federal sentencing. I will come to the question of the significance of the offender’s pleas shortly.
	
	
	One of the significant factors as relevant to the extent of any reduction in sentence is the timing of the pleas and whether they were entered at the first reasonable opportunity.
	
	
	As the Crown accepted, the offender’s pleas are to be taken as having been made at an early stage in the proceedings, they having been entered in the Local Court prior to committal. The Crown, however, also observed that some regard must be given to the fact that the offender failed to return from overseas in breach of orders made by this Court prior to charges being laid, and once he was charged he was later arrested on an international warrant and then fully contested his extradition proceedings in Hong Kong.
	
	
	The Crown relied on such matters in support of its contention that the offender availed himself of multiple opportunities to avoid prosecution and conviction for the present offences.
	
	
	I will shortly indicate that it is appropriate to have regard to the offender’s pleas, made at an early stage, but the factors to which the Crown referred do require a moderated approach, as I will shortly indicate.
	


Deterrence: Section 16A(2)(j), (ja) of the Crimes Act


	
	In relation to the need for general deterrence it is clear that the serious nature of the offender’s conduct requires both specific deterrence and general deterrence to be taken into account.
	
	
	The Crown properly observed that the offender will be automatically disqualified from managing an Australian corporation for a period of five years and that this may be considered to be an additional penalty, a matter relied on by Mr Ramage in his submissions in relation to what was referred to as an extra curial or additional penalty.
	


Character, Antecedents, Age, Means and Physical or Mental Condition of the Offender: Section 16A(2)(m) of the Crimes Act


	
	The offender has no prior convictions in Australia and there is no known criminal record overseas. The Crown submitted that in the context of his ongoing undetected criminal conduct less weight should be given to his prior good character at the time he first commenced his illegal trading.
	
	
	It was submitted by the Crown that the offender’s ongoing undetected conduct in respect of the two separate takeover offers demonstrated a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law and, accordingly, there is an increased need for retribution and general deterrence. I accept that submission.
	
	
	As to the offender’s age, he was 36 years at the time of offending. By that time he was an experienced corporate executive who had exercised powers and responsibilities of a managing director of a corporation and had been involved in high level negotiations with the executives of publicly listed Australian companies.
	
	
	It is accepted as a general principle that some limited recognition can be given to the position of a foreign national serving a sentence of imprisonment in Australia, due to the possibility of hardship from language difficulties and a more restricted support network.
	
	
	The offender, though a foreign national, plainly has a reasonable command of the English language. I note that his permanent residency visa expired in June 2014.
	
	
	There is no evidence as to any specific hardship that he has or is likely to experience whilst in custody being a foreign national.
	
	
	As to other subjective matters arising in respect of personal factors concerning the offender, reliance was placed upon the Report of Anthony Diment, Consultant Psychologist, dated 27 October 2015 (Exhibit 4) (Report) in these proceedings.
	
	
	The Crown raised objections to particular passages in the report, they being on page 6 and page 10.7 of the report. The Crown contended that those paragraphs either should be held to be inadmissible or, if admitted, not be given any weight.
	
	
	The first relates (on page 6) to statements made by the offender to Mr Diment as to personal circumstances preceding and leading up to the time of the offending conduct, including particular stress and factors operating upon him. At page 10, reference is made to similar statements in which the author in his summary or opinion in referring to what was referred to as a higher anxiety state, expressed the opinion that this was likely to have affected his decision-making at the time of the offending.
	
	
	The authorities in this area are well known. I refer in particular to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353 which emphasises the need for great caution in acting upon opinions of professionals such as medical practitioners or psychologists that are based on statements that have not been the subject of admissible or direct evidence. The caselaw indicates, as the Crown submitted, that caution needs to be exercised in reports that rely on hearsay material provided by an offender, unsupported by evidence from him. They should ordinarily be given limited, if any, weight. I accept the submissions from the Crown and, in relation to the particular passages to which I have referred, I do not intend to place any weight upon them.
	


(I) CO-OPERATION WITH AUTHORITIES


	
	Whilst the offender has not provided any co-operation to investigating authorities, and failed to return to Australia in breach of Court orders, it is noted in contrast that the co‑offender, Zhu, co-operated with ASIC, in relation to his own offences, prior to charges being laid. In addition to the assistance he provided he agreed to provide future assistance and also consented to a pecuniary penalty order in respect of the benefits obtained from his offending.
	
	
	I have been advised today by Mr Ramage, counsel on behalf of the offender, that there has been no finalisation of any proceedings concerning the making of a pecuniary penalty order in these proceedings concerning the offender and, accordingly, it is not a matter I can bring into account.
	


(J) REMORSE OR CONTRITION


	
	There is no direct evidence from the offender amounting to a demonstration of any remorse or contrition other than that which may be said to be inherent in his pleas of guilty. I accept that the pleas do, however, contain in them an element of remorse or contrition or can be so construed.
	
	
	In contrasting the matter of Zhu, a favourable finding was made in his case of a substantial contrition and remorse in that case.
	
	
	In his Report, Mr Diment recorded the offender saying that he felt very ashamed and very sorry to his mother-in-law, especially, in respect of this offending.
	
	
	Mr Diment stated that the offender had expressed his deep contrition as regards his offending and as much as possible had given thought to his future: Report at p 11.
	
	
	A number of testimonials were tendered at the sentence hearing (Exhibit 1). In a letter from the offender’s grandparents, who are resident in China, reference was made to the offender’s application to his studies over time and to his achievements. His grandparents record that he admitted to them that he was really sorry to Australia for his act and felt remorseful.
	
	
	In a testimonial by his former wife, reference is made to the offender’s expressions of regret for his wrongdoing and to his remorse and his strong determination to make amends in the future.
	
	
	Additionally, I note that the offender stated to Mr Diment that he appreciated that his offending was unfair to other investors and that he had no excuses for that. He further stated that he wanted to pay back to society in some way in the future and to use his case as an example to others as to what not to do: Report at p 10.
	
	
	In the circumstances where there is no evidence from the offender himself given at the sentencing hearing, if is difficult to determine the extent of genuine remorse or contrition by him, as distinct, for example, from his regret in finding himself in the position that he is now in. That said, I am prepared to accept that he has made expressions indicating contrition in respect of his offending. I conclude that they are to be taken as having been made genuinely and I propose, accordingly, to bring into account in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed the fact that there is evidence of expressions by him of contrition or remorse.
	


(K) GOOD CHARACTER


	
	It was submitted on his behalf that he has no prior convictions and is otherwise to be taken as a person of good character. It was acknowledged that in sentencing for white collar offences, less weight has sometimes been attached by sentencing judges to prior good character because of the absence of any criminal offences and good character that placed the offender in the position which enabled him to commit offences such as the insider trading offences. However, it was submitted, it is still relevant and important.
	
	
	I consider the offender’s prior good character to be relevant, in particular, to determining the appropriate sentences and I take into account his good character and, in particular, in relation to the issue of specific deterrence.
	
	
	I have earlier noted that the offender was 36 years of age at the time of the offending and I note that Zhu, his co-offender, at the time was 27 years of age.
	


(L) PARITY


	
	The issue of parity was raised in submissions by Mr Ramage, on behalf of the offender. Firstly, as to the parity principle, the submissions for the offender raised an issue as to the application of the parity principle. That principle requires that like offenders should be treated in like manner. However, as the High Court observed in Green v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462, the parity principle allows for different sentences to be imposed on like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances (per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ at [28]).
	
	
	Formal identity of charges against offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of the application of the principle. However, as the High Court observed, there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The submissions as to the parity principle in this case are relevant to the sentencing for Charge 2 (the Wingatta Offending) insofar as the co-offender, Zhu, has previously been sentenced in respect of insider trading offences related to the same joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	The circumstances of the respective offending of co-offenders must include consideration of the roles played by them in the instigation of the plan, the anticipated and actual profit made by each offender, and the extent of involvement of each in each of the trades utilising the insider information: Kamay v R [2015] VSCA 296 at [63].
	


(M) THE ROLES AND ACTIVITIES OF THE OFFENDER AND HIS CO-ACCUSED, MR ZHU


	
	It was submitted on behalf of the offender that the co-accused Zhu was equally involved, if not more so, in all of the market negotiations that led up to offers being put to Bannerman and Sundance. The submission made reference to the Agreed Statement of Facts at [36]-[76]: Written Submissions at p 21.
	
	
	It was additionally submitted for the offender that, in relation to the Wingatta Offending, Zhu was responsible for investments and there was nothing in the Agreed Facts that supported the proposition that the offender was the dominant figure in the ongoing operations. It was submitted that the facts indicated a “collective decision” by all members of the Wingatta fund. Further, it was contended that the offender’s position could not be distinguished from Zhu who, it was contended, had much, if not more, direct involvement in the takeover negotiations and that he was responsible for the actual trades: Written Submission on behalf of the offender, p 21.
	
	
	With respect, I do not consider that those submissions properly address the roles and the participation of the offender and Zhu in relation to the events leading up to the Bannerman takeover or in respect to the events leading up to and concerning the Sundance takeover.
	
	
	The Statement of Agreed Facts states that although the offender and Zhu worked together in relation to meetings, negotiations, confidentiality agreements and discussions and other matters, Zhu, as would be expected of a subordinate employee, consulted on a regular basis with the offender to seek his approval or confirmation on action that Zhu had taken or what was proposed would be taken. I have earlier referred to some of the details relating to the events concerning both takeover matters.
	
	
	In relation to Bannerman:
	



	
	The offender and others (including Zhu, Yang and Chen) were involved in activities from April 2011 once Bannerman had been identified as a takeover target: Agreed Facts at [42].
	
	
	Thereafter from time to time Zhu would consult with the offender and pass on to him proposals made on behalf of Bannerman or its advisors: Agreed Facts at [43].
	
	
	In June 2011, a proposal for the acquisition of 70% of Bannerman shares was received by Zhu, who then consulted and discussed it with the offender: Agreed Facts at [44].
	
	
	On 4 July 2011, the offender, following instructions from Mr Liu, told Zhu to amend a draft proposal for the takeover offer to Bannerman from 70% to 100% acquisition: Agreed Facts at [46].
	



	
	In relation to the events leading up to the acquisition of Bannerman, Zhu was at all times subordinate to the offender and did not act independently but consulted with the offender and kept him informed and sought instructions and approvals or agreement from him in relation to events preceding the conditional proposal drafted by Zhu and approved by the offender on or about 9 July 2011.
	
	
	On the evidence, and in particular in relation to the question of parity, there are clearly a number of disparities in the facts that are to be taken into account in respect of the offender, as compared to the facts for the sentencing of the co-offender Zhu.
	
	
	It is to be borne in mind, of course, that the offender is only to be sentenced for the facts contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts. On that basis I accept the submissions for the Crown that there are a number of significant differences between the circumstances of the offending of the offender and those relating to the offending of Zhu. In that respect, the Crown noted the following matters:
	



	
	Position in Hanlong Mining: The offender was at all times Managing Director of Hanlong Mining and the CEO of Hanlong Resources. Zhu, who held the position of Vice President, Investments at Hanlong Mining was a subordinate to the offender.
	
	
	Reporting and Instructions: The relevant positions of the offender and Zhu involved Zhu reporting to, and receiving instructions from, the offender in relation to significant investment decisions. A finding was made in the Remarks on Sentence so far as Zhu was concerned, to his benefit, that he had been the subject of what was referred to as “a poisonous work culture” which involved the offender.
	
	
	The roles in the Wingatta Offending: The Crown observed that the offender was the dominant figure in the Wingatta Offending. Zhu, on the other hand, was found to have had a somewhat lesser role, although he was responsible for executing the trades.
	
	
	Share of Wingatta investment: The offender’s share of the total investment in the Bannerman and Sundance trades was $782,081. As previously noted, Zhu’s share was $333,563.
	
	
	Share of Wingatta profit: The offender’s share of the total profit from the Bannerman and Sundance was $633,320, as earlier noted. Zhu’s share was $305,074.
	
	
	Other offending: The offender separately invested a further $1,221,522 in Bannerman and Sundance trades, and obtained a further profit from the personal trading, as earlier indicated, of $873,347. Zhu separately invested a further $49,098 and obtained a further profit through his personal trading of $67,430. In two earlier periods with previous employers, Zhu had been involved in trades worth $70,393 and a total profit of $83,370.
	



	
	The Crown submission, which I accept, was that the offender’s conduct in the Wingatta Offending was significantly more serious than that of his subordinate Zhu, and his subjective circumstances are significantly less compelling than was the case in Zhu.
	
	
	In addition, the offender’s other offences on the schedule as represented by Charge 1 in my assessment are also more serious than the offences of Zhu.
	


Pre-Sentence Custody


	
	The sentence to be imposed may be backdated so as to commence on a date before the sentence is imposed in accordance with the provisions of s 16E of the Crimes Act and s 47(2)-(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1986 and so to take account of pre-sentence custody.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody, as I have indicated, since his arrest in Hong Kong on 12 January 2014 following which he was extradited to Australia and has been bail refused since.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that the offender’s pre-sentence custody should be taken into account by backdating the commencement date of the sentence to start on 12 January 2014.
	


Rehabilitation Prospects


	
	I turn now to further matters. One concerns the rehabilitation prospects of the offender. The other concerns the reduction or discount to be allowed for his guilty pleas, to which I earlier referred.
	
	
	As to the former, his rehabilitation prospects, the offender did not give evidence, as I have said, at the sentencing hearing. Accordingly, the evidence relevant to his rehabilitation prospects is limited. In his Report, Mr Diment noted that the offender on examination had indicated that he has “average” levels of social support which is said to be a favourable prognostic sign for future adjustment (Report at p 9). In terms of prognosis, Mr Diment stated that the risk factors for re-offending were, in his opinion, low. These were identified as including the absence of any prior criminal history, a supportive family, self-awareness and no criminogenic traits as assessed on PAI (Personal Assessment Inventory) testing, as well as an express motivation for caring for his family and working to achieve that goal. Mr Diment stated that there were no anti-social personality traits. On this basis, he assessed the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation as being good.
	
	
	I accept the analysis undertaken by Mr Diment and, on that basis, I have concluded that the offender has reasonably good prospects of rehabilitation.
	


Discount on Sentences by Reason of Offender’s Guilty Pleas


	
	In relation to his guilty pleas, there is no obligation for there to be any specific quantification of a discount for a guilty plea: R v Tylor (2007) 173 A Crim R 458; [2007] NSWCCA 247 at [114]. The offender’s pleas may be taken, as I have indicated, as indicating some acceptance of responsibility and the fact that they were entered at an early stage is an important factor. I take into account both of these factors.
	
	
	The pleas, however, are also to be evaluated, as the Crown has submitted, in the overall context which includes his failure to return from overseas in breach of Court orders prior to charges being laid. I have sought to assess these matters in assessing the value of the guilty pleas when determining sentence and how his pleas operate in mitigation or reduction of any sentence to be imposed.
	


Assessment of the Offender’s Guilty Pleas


	
	In the circumstances of this case, I consider that the offender’s guilty pleas are to be taken into account on sentencing as a mitigating factor in the determination of sentence. For that purpose his guilty pleas, in my assessment, carry moderate significance, as distinct from them being at the highest level of significant for the purpose of sentence discounting. Accordingly, the offender’s pleas have been taken into account by me on the above bases in determining the sentences to be imposed.
	


Need for Adequate Punishment: Section 16A(2)(k) of the Crimes Act


	
	Section 16A(2)(k) of the Crimes Act requires attention to be given to the need for adequate punishment. In determining punishment, in some cases it is necessary to have regard to what has been referred to as “extracurial” or additional punishment.
	
	
	The Crown noted that the offender will be automatically disqualified from managing an Australian corporation for a period of 5 years. This serves the function of protecting the public from dishonest officeholders.
	
	
	The loss of a career and professional reputation may, in some cases, amount to extracurial punishment. The Crown noted that the offender’s abuse in this case was of his own corporate office and that it was that which permitted him to commit his crimes and that he must have appreciated that it would impact on his career and reputation in the business community.
	
	
	The Crown also observed that it is by no means clear that the offender would not be able to continue his career in some capacity, particularly overseas as a foreign national. The Crown referred to the fact that he had for a period obtained employment in Hong Kong under an assumed name.
	
	
	In the submissions for the offender it was noted that cases on extracurial or additional punishment do not draw a distinction on whether the offender had been the author of his own misfortune. That, it was submitted, must be a common factor in almost every case that is being considered.
	
	
	It was also submitted for the offender that it is pure speculation as to whether he might be able to continue with his career in the future.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the matters relied upon by the Crown, I consider that there is a very real prospect that the offender will suffer the consequences of his criminal offending to future employment in what is today a global society with digital communications in which the background reputation of persons can be readily ascertained. It is not to be assumed that reputation within the business community is confined necessarily to this country. Having said that, however, I accept the point made by the Crown in submissions having regard to the offender’s ability to obtain post-offending employment.
	
	
	I consider, accordingly, that some weight should be given to the fact as to his likely disqualification from managing an Australian corporation and the real prospect that he will suffer from the loss of his career and professional reputation. Accordingly, these matters are to be taken into account. I do so and make allowance for those factors in determining the sentences to be imposed.
	
	
	I do not consider this is a case in which there is any evidence or basis upon which the matter of adverse publicity can be taken into account as there are no exceptional circumstances in that regard established.
	


Principles of Totality: Issues of Concurrency and Accumulation


	
	In relation to sentencing, by reason of the fact that I am sentencing the offender for multiple offences, I must proceeding in accordance with the principle of totality in particular those stated by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624. Additionally, in terms of determining issues of accumulation and concurrency, relevant principles have been established and were expressed in the decision of the Court of Criminal appeal in Chayadi v The Crown (2007) 168 A Crim R 41, in particular, in the judgment of Howie J in that case.
	
	
	It is necessary that an appropriate sentence be determined, first, for each offence and questions of accumulation and concurrency are then to be determined. It is well accepted that totality is a most important consideration in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	In order to properly give effect to the principle of totality in respect of the offender’s criminality I consider that there must be some accumulation of sentences. The sentences to be imposed must be assessed, in addition to other matters that I have discussed, in the context of a case in which the offender was a true insider and his offending involved, in relation to both Charges 1 and 2, as I have said, involved gross breaches of trust and confidentiality in the use of inside information of high quality for his own personal benefit.
	
	
	Whilst it is true that the offending only took place over a period of approximately two weeks, the fact is that his offending was made up of a great many individual contraventions, as I have said, committed with actual knowledge as to their illegality. The offender’s trading, in other words, is to be distinguished, in my view, from cases in which, on the basis of some aberration or lack of judgment on one particular occasion, a contravention of the insider trading provisions has occurred. I have also taken into account the subjective matters to which I have earlier made mention.
	


The Provisions of Section 17A Crimes Act 1914


	
	In accordance with the provisions of s 17A of the Crimes Act, a sentence of imprisonment on a person for a federal offence shall not be imposed unless the court, having considered all other available sentences, is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.
	
	
	On the basis of the Agreed Statement of Facts, the conclusions and findings to which I have referred, I am well satisfied that the seriousness of the offences are such that no other sentence is appropriate and indeed the submission for the offender properly acknowledge that fact.
	
	
	In those circumstances the length of the term of the sentence must be fixed without regard to how the sentence is to be served. Once the sentences have been determined, the Court is to consider whether any alternative to imprisonment is available.
	
	
	In accordance with s 19AB(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), where a court imposes federal sentences that, in the aggregate exceed 3 years, a single non-parole period is to be fixed.
	
	
	In determining sentence I consider that the objective seriousness of the rolled-up charge, Charge 2 exceeds that of Charge 1 including the additional matters on the schedule in respect of Charge 1. In that respect I have assessed the objective seriousness of all the insider trading offences and taken into account the level of personal investment as well as the profit that the offender made from the offences.
	
	
	In respect of Charge 1 as against Charge 2, the level of personal expenditure and profit in relation to Charge 1 exceeded that of Charge 2. However, the offending with respect to Charge 2 represents, in my opinion, a serious and continuing disregard by the offender of the law and of his fiduciary and other trust obligations, in particular aggravated by the extent to which he was the dominant party. The use of a loan, as I have indicated, in relation to the $US1 million loan obtained in order to finance the trading, the subject of Charge 2 was a serious aggravating factor. As to a case where a number of persons working in concert for an alleged illegal purpose, I refer to the observations in The DPP v Fabriczy (2010) 30 VR 632 wherein it was stated:
	


“The element of concert makes the offence of conspiracy more serious than if an individual were acting alone to plan and commit the offence, as the likelihood of the crime occurring is increased by the involvement of multiple participants making a commitment to each other to do so. There is said to be a ‘dangerousness’ inherent in the plotting, ‘either because several may achieve what an individual would find difficult or impossible, or because other criminal plans may emerge from the group’.” (14-16)


	
	It is accepted, of course, that the offender is to be sentenced for a joint commission offence and not a conspiracy but nonetheless similar considerations, as the Crown submitted, apply.
	
	
	I proceed to determine the sentences in respect of Charges 1 and 2. I will then proceed to determine the single non-parole period in accordance with the provisions of s 19AB(1)(d). In determining the non-parole and parole periods I am required, of course, to proceed in accordance with the principles enunciated by the High Court in Hili v Jones (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [34]-[40].
	


Sentences


	
	Hui Xiao, is convicted of the offences, Charges 1 and 2.
	
	
	In respect of Charge 1, taking into account the additional matters on the Schedule pursuant to s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 6 years commencing 12 January 2014 and to expire on 11 January 2020 consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months expiring on 11 October 2017.
	
	
	In respect of Charge 2, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 7 years commencing on 12 April 2015 and to expire on 11 April 2022, consisting of a non-parole period of 4 years 3 months to commence on 12 April 2015 and to expire on 11 July 2019.
	
	
	An effective overall sentence in respect of Charges 1 and 2 accordingly is a term of imprisonment of 8 years 3 months commencing on 12 January 2014 and expiring on 11 April 2022 with an effective overall non-parole period of 5 years 6 months.
	
	
	In respect of Charge 1 and Charge 2, I determine a single non‑parole period of 5 years 6 months commencing 12 January 2014 and expiring on 11 July 2019.
	
	
	The first date upon which you will be eligible for parole, accordingly, will be 11 July 2019.

		15 March 2016",2016-03-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2427463,R v Meatuai [2016] NSWCCA 42,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with the conclusions of Fullerton J and RS Hulme AJ that the Crown appeal should be allowed. Regrettably, I cannot agree with the restructure of sentences and orders proposed by RS Hulme AJ. On that issue, I prefer the structure proposed by Fullerton J. Accordingly, I agree with the orders proposed by Fullerton J.
	
	
	FULLERTON J: I have read the draft judgment of RS Hulme AJ and gratefully adopt his Honour’s summary of the evidence led on sentence and his summary of the sentencing remarks.
	
	
	However, I agree in part only with the orders his Honour proposes in the disposition of the Crown appeal. I agree that the Crown appeal should be allowed and that the respondent should be re-sentenced to an effective non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months (to commence on 5 December 2013) with a balance of term of 2 years, that is, an increase in the effective sentence imposed by the sentencing judge of 18 months (from 5 years to 6 years and 6 months) and an increase in the effective non-parole period of 1 year (from 3 years and 6 months to 4 years and 6 months).
	
	
	I would propose that the appeal against the sentences imposed on both counts be allowed and that the respondent be re-sentenced on each count, with the sentence on the second count (the count that involved the assault on Louisa Vickers) to be marginally less than that imposed on the first count (the count that involved the assault on Michael Lester) and for the sentences to be accumulated by 12 months. With the sentences structured in that way, the far more serious assault on Ms Vickers and the more serious injuries that she sustained, will be reflected by an increase in sentence, but moderated by the need to ensure against double punishment, given the element of break, enter and steal common to both counts, and the need to ensure against double punishment (see Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610).
	
	
	In expressing my reasons for coming to that view, I would wish to emphasise that I accept the Crown’s submission that the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge on each count of 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years, failed to reflect his Honour’s findings of “offending well above the mid-range for an offence of this kind”, a finding with which the respondent’s counsel on the appeal took no issue.
	
	
	In his Honour’s sentencing remarks it is clear that he made that finding not by making a judgment on the seriousness of an offence under s 112 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) per se, a judgment that could not sensibly be made in the abstract given the range of serious indictable offences that may be committed by an offender on breaking and entering the premises, but because of the particular serious indictable offences committed in this case, namely assaults occasioning actual bodily harm, where random and unprovoked serious violence was inflicted on both victims in their own homes, with the female victim assaulted after she sought to intervene on her partner’s behalf and suffering the more serious injuries in the process.
	
	
	As accepted by the sentencing judge, there was nothing of any significant weight in the respondent’s subjective circumstances that operated in mitigation of sentence including, significantly, no evidence of remorse other than what is implicit in the pleas of guilty. Although, as RS Hulme AJ noted at [24], Dr Teoh diagnosed a polysubstance abuse and an antisocial behaviour disorder, his report also notes that given the entries for violence on the respondent’s criminal and custodial record, it appears that he has little insight into what triggers his violent conduct, including his drug use, and has little impulse control.
	
	
	After giving full account to the incontrovertible fact that there is no single correct sentence in any given case, and giving full weight to the limiting considerations that govern Crown appeals, I am satisfied that the primary judge’s sentencing discretion miscarried and that the sentences imposed on each count were erroneously lenient.
	
	
	In considering whether the residual discretion in s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) should be exercised in this case, I have taken into account the submission advanced by the respondent that identifying the error in the sentencing discretion and the reason for it (in this case, the sentencing judge’s failure to reflect in the sentences imposed his finding of objective seriousness and the application of the principles under s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) can, itself, achieve the objective to which Crown appeals are directed, without the need for an increase in the respondent’s sentence (see Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [37]).
	
	
	I have also taken into account the Crown’s submission that to decline to intervene in the exercise of the residual discretion would result in sentences that are inconsistent with established sentencing principles, including the need for them both to adequately reflect the need for specific deterrence and to be a denunciation of serious physical violence inflicted on innocent members of the community in their homes by intruders.
	
	
	There being no evidence relied upon by the respondent bearing on the exercise of the residual discretion (or re-sentence generally), I am satisfied that the Crown has satisfactorily addressed the submissions advanced on the respondent’s behalf as to why the residual discretion should be exercised in his favour in this case (see CMB v The Attorney General (NSW) [2015] HCA 9, 243 A Crim R 282 at [36]).
	
	
	The orders I propose are as follows:
	



	
	Allow the Crown appeal.
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed on Count 1 and, in substitution, impose a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months commencing on 5 December 2013 and a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 4 June 2019.
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed on Count 2 and, in substitution, impose a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 4 June 2015 and a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 4 June 2020.
	
	
	The total effective sentence will be 6 years and 6 months, to commence from 5 December 2013 and to expire 4 June 2020, comprised of a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months also to date from 5 December 2013 with the respondent eligible to be considered for parole on 4 June 2018.
	



	
	RS HULME AJ: This is a Crown appeal against sentences imposed by Solomon ADCJ on 28 August 2015 - sentences which the Crown submits are manifestly inadequate. The Respondent to the appeal had pleaded guilty to two charges, viz:
	



	
	On 5 December 2013... (he) did break and enter the dwelling house of Louisa Vickers and Michael Lester … and then in the said dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence namely did assault Michael Lester thereby occasioning to him actual bodily harm, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the offence he did use corporal violence on Michael Lester.
	
	
	On 5 December 2013... (he) did break and enter the dwelling house of Louisa Vickers and Michael Lester … and then in the said dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence namely did assault Louisa Vickers thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the offence he did use corporal violence on Louisa Vickers.
	



	
	For the first of these offences his Honour imposed a total term of imprisonment of 4 years 6 months including a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing 5 June 2014. For the second offence his Honour imposed a total term of imprisonment of 4 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing 5 December 2013. The total effective term was therefore 5 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months.
	
	
	Each offence arose pursuant to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and rendered the Respondent liable to imprisonment for 20 years. For offences under the sub-section, a standard non-parole period of 5 years has been prescribed – see Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 (NSW) s 54A et seq.
	
	
	The Respondent entered his guilty pleas on the first day of his trial. His Honour allowed a discount of “some 10%” to reflect the utilitarian value of those pleas.
	
	
	The agreed facts of the offences were that at about 9pm on 5 December 2013 the Respondent and another man entered the house of the victims through the closed unlocked front door. Upon entering the premises the Respondent went straight to the bedroom where Michael Lester was, and assaulted him by punching him repeatedly to the face and body with great force. When Mr Lester had been knocked to the ground, the Respondent continued to punch him to the head.
	
	
	Louisa Vickers entered the bedroom and attempted to intervene. The Respondent turned on her and punched her several times to the face, then pushed her backwards into a glass wardrobe with such force that it shattered. The Respondent again punched her to the face, before taking hold of her hair and dragging her across the room. The Respondent continued to kick and punch her as she lay on the floor.
	
	
	At this point Michael Lester feared that the Respondent might kill Ms Vickers. Mr Lester picked up a knife from the floor (which Ms Vickers had been using in the kitchen prior to the attack) and stabbed the Respondent in the back. Ms Vickers fled the house to raise the alarm. A short while later the Respondent and his co-offender also left the house.
	
	
	The force of the assaults was such that Mr Lester sustained injuries that included: a 10mm laceration to the inside of his lower lip; swelling above the right eye; lacerations to the face; swelling and tenderness to his right hand; a small avulsion fracture to the base of his right middle finger; 40mm diameter bruising to the left torso; a fracture to his nose; and a small fracture to his left 10th rib. He also suffered a septal deviation and a small step fracture to his right nasal bone. Mr Lester subsequently required surgery to correct the deviated septum.
	
	
	Ms Vickers’ injuries included: a comminuted fracture of the nasal bones deviated left; a blow out fracture of the floor of the right orbital eye socket (which did not require surgery); extensive bruising to the right eye area; swelling to her face; various lacerations, bruises and grazes; undisplaced fracture to anterior of left second rib; and vertigo. Ms Vickers also suffered a bald patch where a clump of her hair was pulled out. She required surgery for a closed reduction of her nasal bones, and has ongoing dental treatment to re-align her bite which was pushed out of shape. The bodily harm occasioned was serious but not grievous. A victim impact statement indicates that not all of the consequences of the assault on her have resolved.
	
	
	Prior to the attack the victims were completely unknown to the Respondent. There was no evidence of any motive although it seems clear that the attack was inspired at least significantly in consequence of the Respondent having ingested ice earlier in the day, as he informed a nurse at the hospital where he presented later that night for medical treatment for a stab wound. There he was arrested. On 6 December 2013 he was released from the hospital and into police custody. He has been in custody ever since.
	
	
	Turning to subjective factors, the Respondent was born in 1986. He has a substantial record of offending including four offences of assault, three of robbery, two of driving whilst disqualified and at least three involving drugs. He has offended numerous times over the years whilst in custody, two of these offences being of fighting or participating in other physical combat since his arrest for the subject offences. For some of the assault and robbery offences he has been imprisoned.
	
	
	A report of Dr Ben Teoh, psychiatrist, was tendered on sentence. Dr Teoh recorded that the Respondent was rebellious from a young age, he was beaten up regularly by his father, he started using drugs at age 15, commenced using heroin at age 18, and at the time of interview had been using methamphetamine for 5 years. Dr Teoh diagnosed the Respondent’s presentation as consistent with poly-substance abuse and antisocial behaviour disorder. The doctor recorded that the Respondent “said he could not control his impulses, and it was like ‘instinct’ for his aggressive behaviour” and that the Respondent was intoxicated with methamphetamine at the time of the offence.
	
	
	The Respondent has not had any rehabilitation for his drug use apart from a time while in custody in 2005, and has not received any treatment for his Antisocial Personality Disorder.
	
	
	The only evidence that could be regarded as significantly favourable to the Respondent was a letter from a younger sister who said that she was a training youth worker and spoke of instances when the Respondent displayed decency and serious remorse for some of his actions. She described the Respondent as “lost” and opined that he needed professional assistance for rehabilitation.
	
	
	Solomon ADCJ described the offences as “well above the mid-range for offences of this kind”.
	
	
	A judgment as to the seriousness of an offence under s 112 of the Crimes Act is by no means easy. The section makes it an offence to break and enter a building and commit any serious indictable offence therein (my emphasis). In the Respondent’s case the serious indictable offence was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm – an offence which under s 59 and considered in isolation carries a maximum penalty of 5 years’ imprisonment or, if committed in company, 7 years’ imprisonment. There are many and much more serious indictable offences, including, for example robbery where, under s94 of the Act the maximum penalty unless the offence is aggravated is 14 years, detaining for advantage where under s 86 the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment or, if committed in circumstances of aggravation 20 years imprisonment, and causing grievous bodily harm with intent to do so where, under s 33, the maximum penalty is 25 years. S 112 prescribes the same maximum penalties whichever of these offences is the serious indictable offence committed.
	
	
	Although by the terms of s 54A et seq of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 (NSW) Parliament requires that it be done, the breadth of the “serious offence(s)” also makes it practically impossible to make any sensible judgment as to where, in the words of s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) the “middle range of seriousness” falls. Because s 112 encompasses circumstances where the serious offence involves, for example, detention for advantage in circumstances of aggravation or both actual and intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, any judgment under those sections of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) requires that such offences be taken into account.
	
	
	In this Court both counsel accepted Solomon ADCJ’s finding that the offences were both “well above the mid-range for an offence of this kind” – i.e. falling within s 112(2). In light of the considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraphs and to which his Honour seems to have given no consideration I have considerable doubt whether the conclusion was correct but given the common approach of counsel I am content to act upon the basis of it.
	
	
	That said, the criminality involved in each of the assaults leads to the view that they fell at or very close to the top of the range of offences of assaults occasioning actual bodily harm for which, under s 59(1) a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment is prescribed. Given that the fact that the Respondent’s offences were committed in company is one of the aggravating circumstances identified for offences under s 112, and even though it was not that specified in the charges brought against the Respondent, I do not regard it as appropriate to judge the Respondent’s assault by the terms of aggravated assault in s 59(2).
	
	
	Subject to a qualification dealt with below, the breaking and entering were also elements of criminality that were required to be reflected in the sentences imposed. The severity of the assault combined with and the breaking and entering, the fact that the property broken into was the victims’ home and the fact that the offences were committed in company makes it impossible to regard the Respondent’s offences as anywhere near the bottom of the scale of offences under s 112(2). As I have said, I regard the assault occasioning actual bodily harm component as very close to the top of offences of assaults occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	Another matter to which no particular attention was given in the Court below was the fact that the Respondent’s one incident of breaking and entering was a feature of both of the offences charged. In Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 610; 194 CLR 610 at [43] – [49] the majority of the High Court made clear that where offences have a common element the offender must not be twice punished for that element. The identity in the duration of the sentences imposed on the Respondent indicates that no attention was paid to these dictates of the High Court. Of course the extent of concurrency of the sentences may in part have been intended to ensure, and certainly had the effect of ensuring that, as a practical matter double punishment did not occur but, as the High Court made clear, the concurrency of sentences is not the way that double punishment should be avoided.
	
	
	I turn then to the sentencing considerations to which attention must be given. General deterrence is important. The Courts are aware that there are far too many home-invasion type offences and far too many instances of unprovoked violence by those affected by ice.
	
	
	Specific deterrence must be given weight. The Respondent’s record and the instant offences show that he has not learnt the error of his ways and it needs to be demonstrated to him that any reversion to ice or assaulting people will have consequences detrimental to him.
	
	
	The community needs protection from the Respondent. This is demonstrated not only by his criminal record and his statement to Dr Teoh that he could not control his impulses but also by his addiction to methamphetamine and other drugs. In practical terms he cannot pay for such an addiction except by crime and his methamphetamine addiction is calculated to provoke instances of violence. (In saying what I have in this paragraph I do not forget the limits of the weight that can be placed on this topic of protection of the community – see Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 at 473).
	
	
	Given that the Respondent has had no treatment for his antisocial personality disorder and no treatment outside prison for his addiction and given that he does not seem to have imbibed any of the mores of the law abiding members of the community there is much to be said for the view that his rehabilitation argues for a longer rather than a shorter time in prison.
	
	
	The community and the victims are entitled to retribution.
	
	
	While I appreciate that the Respondent falls to be sentenced for an offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), given the serious indictable offence involved was one under s 59 of that Act, regard may be had to it. If I was considering only the assault component under s 59, I would impose a sentence of 4 ½ years. The breaking and entering requires that that figure be increased and, subject to the qualification for which Pearce v The Queen is authority, in my view the starting point for each of Respondent’s sentences for each offence should have been be not less than 6½ years. An “about 10%” discount would result in a sentence of 5 years and 10 months.
	
	
	There is no occasion in these reasons to dilate upon the tests for determining whether a sentence is manifestly inadequate. I shall content myself with inquiring whether those imposed by Solomon ADCJ were unreasonable or plainly unjust in a sentencing environment where there is no single “correct” sentence – see R v JP [2015] NSWCCA 267 at [43].
	
	
	By that standard, particularly given the discretion imposed on sentencing judges, the sentences of 4 ½ years, although very lenient cannot, considered individually, be said to be manifestly inadequate in their length.
	
	
	However accumulating the sentences by only 6 months as his Honour did was manifestly inadequate. As this Court said in Regina v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 41 at [50] “There is a distinct difference between assaulting one victim and assaulting two.” Even when regard is had to principles of totality such a small increase in sentence for the second and more serious assault, on a second victim, cannot be justified.
	
	
	Should this Court interfere?
	
	
	In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [1] French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ observed that the primary purpose of Crown appeals against sentence is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons. The 6 months increase in this case was a clear breach of the principles that should apply in the case of offences of the seriousness of the Respondents. Furthermore, I regard it as so inadequate as to amount to “an affront to the administration of justice which risks undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system.” Green & Quinn at [42] See also R v Van Ryn [2016] NSWCCA 1 at [282]; R v Feuerstein [2015] NSWCCA 82 at [65].
	
	
	In my view both of these factors argue convincingly for the Court interfering in this case.
	
	
	I have indicated that each offence, considered individually, merited a sentence of not less than 4½ years but, considered in conjunction, the sentence for the second assault should have not included any component for the features of breaking and entering. Giving effect to that last conclusion would mean reducing one of the Respondent’s sentences which is not appropriate when the only matter before the Court is a Crown appeal and, given that an appropriate result and substantial justice can be achieved by adopting Solomon ADCJ’s approach of making the sentences concurrent, that is the course which I would propose
	
	
	In that the Respondent’s overall sentence is to be increased because of the sentence for the second offence, some allowance has to be made for totality. The fact of accumulation constitutes special circumstances.
	
	
	In the result I would propose the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal in respect of the sentence imposed in respect of the offence perpetrated against Louisa Vickers.
	
	
	Allow the appeal in respect of the sentence for the offence perpetrated against Michael Lester.
	
	
	In lieu thereof sentence the Respondent to a non-parole period of 2½ years commencing on 5 December 2015 and a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 5 June 2018.
	
	
	Record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the Respondent shall become eligible for parole 4 June 2018.
	



	
	The effective total sentence will thus be of 6½ years (from 5 December 2013 to 4 June 2020) including a non-parole period of 4½ years (from 5 December 2013 to 4 June 2018).

2427493,Application by Sean Fennell pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2016] NSWSC 307,"Judgment


	
	On 24 July 2012 Sean David Fennell was convicted in the Local Court at Sutherland of an offence against s 16(1)(b) of the Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW). Namely, that on 21 June 2011 he was the owner of and the person in charge of a Rottweiler dog which on that date attacked and injured Mr John Fischer at Glenn McGrath Oval, Carringbah. A fine of $400 was imposed and court costs of $83 were ordered to be paid.
	
	
	Sean Fennell appealed his conviction to the District Court but withdrew the appeal on 14 December 2012. His father David Edward Fennell now applies on behalf of Sean Fennell under ss 78 and 79 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) to have the Court direct an inquiry by a judicial officer into the conviction and sentence.
	
	
	By force of subs (2) of s 79 such an inquiry may only be directed “if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case”. Subsection (3) of s 79 is as follows, so far as relevant to the circumstances of David Fennell’s application:
	


“79 Consideration of applications 

…

(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a) it appears that the matter:

(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

…

(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.”


	
	The operation of subs (3) is attracted to the circumstances of this case by facts which satisfy sub paras (i) and (iv) of para (a). As to (i), the hearing of the charge in the Local Court took place over two days. The prosecutor, Sutherland Shire Council, and the defendant were both legally represented. Full opportunity for cross-examination of prosecution witnesses was afforded and the opportunity was used. The defendant gave evidence in his own case and called two witnesses. Both legal representatives were permitted to address the learned magistrate at length and her Honour gave detailed reasons for her decision on criminal liability. This was followed by ample opportunity for submissions to be made with respect to penalty, which submissions were considered and expressly taken into account by her Honour in fixing the level of the fine.
	
	
	The hearing occupied the whole of 8 May 2012 and was not completed that day. It continued part-heard on 24 July 2012 and occupied the whole of that day as well. The entire proceeding is recorded in slightly over 200 pages of transcript which show that the case was conducted competently by both legal representatives and was managed fairly and efficiently by her Honour. I will return to a summary of the evidence later in these reasons.
	
	
	As to sub para (iv) of s 79(3)(a), this provision is satisfied by the circumstance that Sean Fennell lodged an appeal to the District Court and subsequently withdrew it, as referred to above.
	
	
	In these circumstances, by virtue of subs (3)(b) of s 79, there is reposed in the Court a discretion to “refuse to consider or otherwise deal with” Sean Fennell’s application if I am “not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action”. For reasons which I will shortly give, I am not so satisfied and I refuse to consider or deal with the application.
	
	
	The Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) contains no explicit guidance as to what might constitute special facts or special circumstances for the purposes of subs (3)(b). As a starting point for applying that test to this application, I regard it as necessary to set out a summary of the evidence in the proceedings which led to the conviction and sentence in respect of which the application is made. That summary will expose the relative simplicity of the case and identify the issues which arose.
	


Summary of evidence and issues in the Local Court hearing


	
	The victim who had been attacked by the defendant’s dog gave evidence-in-chief over 14 pages of transcript. He was 75 years old at the date of the attack. He took his dog, a border collie named Harley, for a walk at about 5:20am on 21 June 2011. He walked from his house in Carringbah to the Glenn McGrath Oval which was nearby. He had commenced to jog around the oval when he was knocked to the ground by a Rottweiler which bounded up to him. The dog fastened its jaws onto his right arm, gnawed on it and shook it vigorously, growling as it did so.
	
	
	A man whom Mr Fischer was not able to identify came up to him whilst this was occurring and removed the dog. He said that he would call an ambulance. He said that he lived in “the next street”. No ambulance came and Mr Fischer walked home. His daughter drove him to the emergency department of Sutherland Hospital. He had reduced sensation in his right arm which was bleeding profusely and which the triage nurse described as having sustained a “massive wound”. From Sutherland Hospital he was taken to the Sydney Hand Hospital for specialist examination and treatment.
	
	
	The cross-examination of Mr Fischer was recorded over 43 pages of transcript. He was questioned about how far he had gone on Glenn McGrath Oval when he was attacked. It was put to him that his own dog required a halter and muzzle to restrain it from biting. He was questioned as to whether the man who pulled the dog off him had an English accent. Further questions concerned the point at which he had felt numbness in his arm and when he had first noticed blood from the wound. He was challenged as to the reliability of his identification of the breed of dog which had attacked him. He said he knew it was a Rottweiler because its face was very close to his own. It was put to Mr Fischer that the dog attack occurred at 5am rather than at about 5:30, as said by the witness, but he adhered to his recollection of the time.
	
	
	Defence counsel put to Mr Fischer – and he denied – the defendant’s version of events: that Mr Fischer’s dog had bounded towards the defendant and the two Rottweilers which the defendant was walking, on leads, and had attacked the smaller Rottweiler. It was put that Mr Fischer’s dog had fought with the larger of the defendant’s Rottweilers (named Rommel) and that when Mr Fischer ran up and tried to separate them he was bitten in the course of doing so. All of this was rejected by Mr Fischer. He had made statements about the events prior to the hearing and he was cross-examined about suggested inconsistencies between those statements and his oral evidence.
	
	
	An inspector employed by Sutherland Shire Council, Ms Pettell, gave evidence that information about the dog attack was received by the council from police, who had in turn received a complaint from Mr Fischer and his daughter. Council officers identified that David Fennell, the defendant’s father, was registered as the owner of two Rottweiler dogs. On 14 July 2011 council officers obtained buccal swabs from both of these dogs for the purpose of DNA profiling. Also an identification chip embedded in the neck of each dog between the shoulder blades was scanned to confirm that they were the dogs registered to David Fennell as owner.
	
	
	Another council officer, Mr Richardson, established that the scan of the chips confirmed the identity of the two dogs. He provided evidence of continuity of the buccal swabs and of the jacket which Mr Fischer had been wearing when he was attacked from the hands of council officers to a laboratory which carried out DNA matching. A laboratory report was tendered showing that Mr Fischer had been bitten by the older and larger of the two Rottweilers registered to David Fennell. That is, the dog named Rommel. Mr Richardson testified that on 14 July 2011 at the residence of David and Sean Fennell, the defendant had given a version of the circumstances in which Mr Fischer had been bitten, thereby implicitly acknowledging that he was the person who had been present. This part of the conversation between Mr Richardson and Sean Fennell was challenged in cross-examination. It was put that Sean Fennell had stood mute in the face of Mr Richardson’s questions on this occasion. Mr Richardson disagreed.
	
	
	The defendant gave evidence in his own case. Towards the end of the first hearing day his evidence-in-chief occupied 13 pages of transcript and on the second day, 24 July 2012, a further 8 pages of transcript were taken. He was then cross-examined over 40 pages and re-examined over a further 6. He said that he had had both of his Rottweilers on leads in the very early morning of 21 June 2011 at Glenn McGrath Oval and that Mr Fischer’s border collie “charged out and was real savage and directed it straight at the smaller dog [‘Bonnie’] that I had in my left hand”. He said the collie had had no lead attached and that it ran around behind the defendant and attacked the back left leg of Bonnie. The defendant said that the older and larger dog, Rommel, intervened between Bonnie and Mr Fischer’s collie and that a fight between the two of them ensued.
	
	
	According to the defendant Mr Fischer arrived at the scene and wrapped his arm around the neck of his own dog whilst it was fighting with Rommel in a bid to separate them. He denied having seen Rommel bite Mr Fischer and he disputed that this occurred. He also denied that Mr Fischer was ever knocked to the ground. He said that Bonnie did not fight with or bite Mr Fischer’s collie nor bite Mr Fischer himself. He expressed the view that it was “very probable” that Mr Fischer was bitten by his own dog during his endeavour to separate it from Rommel. Sean Fennell denied that he had allowed either of his dogs off their leads at or about the time Mr Fischer said he was attacked.
	
	
	The defendant asserted, in cross-examination for the first time, that his smaller and younger dog Bonnie was subsequently found to have suffered a leg injury due to twisting, which required surgery and which he claimed was consistent with the injury having been sustained when Mr Fischer’s border collie attacked, as he described. He said there was no externally visible wound to Bonnie but that its back left knee had had to be reconstructed. He attributed this to the alleged encounter with Mr Fischer’s border collie. Sean Fennell accepted that he was in charge of the two Rottweilers at the time of the interaction between the dogs and Mr Fischer. His claim not to have seen any of the dogs bite Mr Fischer was made notwithstanding he had his own two dogs on leads and therefore in close proximity to himself throughout. Sean Fennell gave evidence that he was the owner of Rommel although he had caused it to be registered in his father’s name because he was himself intending to travel overseas.
	
	
	The triage nurse at Sutherland Hospital to whom I have referred above, Ms David, was called in the defence case. She said that Mr Fischer had presented with a “massive wound on his right forearm” and that he had said it was the result of being “accidentally attacked by another dog”. She did not explore with Mr Fischer what he had meant by “accidentally”; nor did she question him on the details of the incident.
	
	
	The final witness for the defence was a professional dog trainer named Steven Austin. He testified to the likelihood of a person being bitten on the arm if he should involve his hands and/or arms in a fight between two dogs – which is what the defendant asserted had occurred.
	
	
	On this evidence the question whether the prosecution had made out the offence clearly turned upon whether the magistrate was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of Mr Fischer’s account of events and whether or not she was affected by any reasonable doubt in the matter upon the basis of the conflicting version given by the defendant. The magistrate found Mr Fischer’s version of events “consistent and plausible”. She considered that he had been “ably cross-examined about discrepancies in different versions he had given”. Her Honour considered submissions on behalf of the defendant about characteristics of Mr Fischer’s evidence which were said to make him “a contrary witness”. The learned magistrate rejected these submissions and found Mr Fischer to have been “careful but straightforward”. She considered that at times during the giving of his evidence he had shown signs of being exasperated but she did not find him “contrary”. Her Honour did not find significance in the discrepancies between his oral evidence and past out-of-Court statements. She considered that he had not been shaken by cross-examination as to his account of the events.
	
	
	On the other hand, her Honour did not find the defendant’s evidence satisfactory or reliable. The wound on Mr Fischer’s right forearm, which was described by the triage nurse and was the subject of photographs tendered in the prosecution case, clearly demonstrated that Mr Fischer had been severely bitten. It was not at all credible to the learned magistrate that Sean Fennell should not have seen this bite take place, given that he claimed to have been holding both of his Rottweilers on leads at the time it must have occurred. The DNA matching strongly supported a conclusion that Rommel had inflicted the wound.
	
	
	Her Honour also found it discrediting of Sean Fennell that his assertion that his smaller dog Bonnie had been injured in what he described as a clash between all three dogs was first mentioned in cross-examination. If there was truth in this her Honour thought it would have been clear to Sean Fennell that it would materially support his version of events and tend to contradict that of Mr Fischer – yet he had not mentioned it in his evidence-in-chief. Further, her Honour found highly implausible Sean Fennell’s contention that it may have been Mr Fischer’s own dog Harley that inflicted the severe injury on his right arm.
	
	
	In addition to these material improbabilities in Sean Fennell’s evidence her Honour assessed his demeanour as being defensive and at times extremely defensive. She considered that this did not enhance his credit. In summation her Honour said: “I just did not believe Mr Fennell’s account. I could not rely on it. … In my view it was not a reliable account and in my view at times it contained direct lies”. I find the learned magistrate’s reasons coherent, logical and measured. I see no basis for doubting her conclusions.
	


The grounds of the application


	
	It has been said that the emergence of new facts that have not been previously agitated may constitute “special facts or special circumstances” to justify the taking of further action under ss 78 and 79 notwithstanding that there has been a full hearing of the charge at first instance and/or an appeal which has been withdrawn: see Re Cheney (No 1) [2015] NSWSC 291 at [35]. I will state in summary form the grounds which have been advanced by David Fennell on behalf of his son Sean in support of the application under ss 78 and 79, first in order to see whether these raise any new facts which were not agitated in the Local Court hearing and secondly to see whether they raise any fact or circumstance which is “special” in any other sense relevant for the purposes of the section.
	
	
	The applicant’s grounds have been presented to the Court in four documents as follows:
	



	
	404 typed pages divided into 44 sections submitted to the Court under cover of a letter of 20 October 2013;
	
	
	a 6 page letter dated 4 December 2013 containing supplementary submissions;
	
	
	an 8 page letter plus annexures submitted 23 February 2015 and
	
	
	88 pages of submissions in reply together with 18 pages of annexures (these were in reply to submissions on behalf of the Crown dated 6 July 2015, of 22 pages).
	



	
	The documents identified in the preceding paragraph make reference to a large volume of supporting material supplied to the Court in electronic form. If printed the supporting material would run to several lever arch folders. I have examined it cursorily, to satisfy myself of its general nature rather than to master its detail.
	
	
	For the purpose of describing the general nature of the material in the original 404 page submission, the various sections of it may be grouped as follows. Sections 1 – 8, 13 – 19, 21 – 29, 37 and 39: These are submissions about the evidence given before the magistrate, in which extracts are quoted and arguments are made about contradictions, improbabilities, and credibility of witnesses. Gratuitous unsworn additional assertions of fact are made, including unsworn and unqualified opinion evidence about the characteristics of the respective breeds of dogs which were involved in the incident. There are also assertions made in these sections concerning evidence which it is said might have been called but was not, about alleged lack of adequate continuity evidence for physical and documentary exhibits and many other subjects.
	
	
	The submissions in these sections do not raise any special facts or circumstances which would justify the taking of any further action in relation to the conviction. The defendant had every opportunity to argue the points now made and to adduce any of the additional evidence which is now referred to. There is nothing relevantly special about the matters raised. Without sifting through the enormous volume of submissions it is not possible to discriminate whether some of them may in fact have been agitated in the hearing before the magistrate in any event. Some of the arguments that are raised are invalid or weak. Having regard to the thoroughness with which, as the transcript shows, this very insignificant case was litigated, it may reasonably be inferred that to the extent available arguments mentioned in the applicant’s present submission were not agitated in the hearing this would likely have been because the defendant’s legal representative chose not to.
	
	
	Sections 9, 10: These sections are concerned with the making of a dangerous dog declaration and control orders in August 2011 and with various hearsay assertions by dog handlers at Hanrob Dog Training School Heathcote. None of this material appears relevant to the case or admissible in it. To the extent that it may have been it would have been available at the time of the hearing and no special circumstance is demonstrated by adverting to it at this stage, in connection with an application under s 79.
	
	
	Sections 11, 12: Allegations are made of undue familiarity between council officers and the complainant, Mr Fischer. It is also asserted that Mr Fischer had various associations with the council through his involvement in community affairs. Assuming these assertions to be correct there is no apparent significance in them, with respect to the conduct of the prosecution. Having read the transcript of the proceedings in the Local Court it is apparent that the essential facts in issue fell to be determined according to the credibility of Mr Fischer’s account. Whatever association he may have had with the council and however familiar and friendly relations may have been between him and any council officers, these matters could not make any difference to the magistrate’s assessment of his evidence. No special facts or circumstances are demonstrated by the matters raised in these sections.
	
	
	Section 20: In this section the applicant complains of the unavailability of Legal Aid in circumstances where his son, the defendant, “had no money and could not afford to pay for a proper legal defence to the charge”. The complaint relates to funding for representation at first instance. This assertion gives rise to no special fact or circumstance because in fact the defendant did obtain legal representation for the hearing. It is demonstrable from the transcript that the representation was competent and at least adequate.
	
	
	Section 30: In this section the applicant analyses the magistrate’s expressed reasons for her decision and offers a critique of them. The criticisms made of her Honour’s reasoning do not appear to be justified. But even if they were the existence of deficiencies in the reasons would not constitute any special fact or circumstance warranting further enquiry under s 79 because these matters could have been taken up on appeal. A repetitive theme in the submissions, including in section 30, is that the magistrate failed to appreciate that the defendant was unwell and in pain when he gave evidence and failed to take this into account in assessing him as a witness. In fact the transcript shows that the magistrate was informed at the beginning of the hearing about the defendant’s illness and discomfort. There is no basis for an inference that she did not take it into account.
	
	
	Section 31: The applicant attributes the failure to prosecute the appeal to a lack of funds. The conviction was for a very minor offence. The penalty was small and an appeal with legal representation could not have been justified upon economic grounds. Nor could it have been justified on grounds of concern with respect to criminal record and reputation. The conviction involves no element of violence, dishonesty or immorality. It is a regulatory infringement. It is comparable in status with a road traffic offence. Hence there was not sufficient at stake in the appeal, either on economic or other grounds, to have warranted pursuit of it even if funds could have been procured.
	
	
	The fact of an appeal not having proceeded, assuming that this occurred for want of funding, does not give rise to any relevant special circumstance. It certainly does not warrant that the Supreme Court should now inquire into this application, at the enormous public expense which would be involved in reviewing the hundreds of pages of written submissions in detail, where the party interested has not prosecuted an appeal through an avenue that was readily available to him. It is apparent that the voluminous submissions submitted on this application have not been prepared by a legal practitioner. As the defendant is able to mobilise, without legal representation, the considerable effort that has been put into this application, so he could have prosecuted his appeal to the District Court without representation.
	
	
	Section 32: In this section unsworn hearsay evidence is provided concerning a confrontation between the defendant and Mr Fischer’s wife on 11 March 2012. This is completely irrelevant to the conviction.
	
	
	Sections 33 and 34: The applicant quotes articles published in local newspapers of the southern suburbs of Sydney and asserts that they contain inaccuracies. Again these assertions are entirely beside the point to the present application under s 79.
	
	
	Sections 35, 36 and 41: The applicant has reviewed a number of internal council communications and proffers criticisms of their accuracy. These have no bearing upon the correctness or otherwise of the magistrate’s decision, including her evaluation of the evidence led before her and her application of the law to her findings.
	
	
	Section 38: The applicant has quoted another article from a southern suburbs local newspaper which attests to the potential danger to human beings if they intrude themselves into fights between dogs. It was open to the defendant to adduce evidence on this subject to whatever extent he wished at the hearing in the Local Court. The provision of this additional evidence after conviction does not give rise to any special circumstance which would warrant further inquiry into the matter. In any event, the whole topic would only be relevant if the tribunal of fact had accepted that Mr Fischer did intrude himself into a fight between his dog and one of the defendant’s dogs. That was the case which the defendant advanced but which the magistrate rejected.
	
	
	Section 40: The applicant describes the circumstances in which he acquired his dog Rommel. That history is irrelevant to the question of whether there is any reason to doubt the reliability of the magistrate’s finding that the charge against the defendant was proved.
	
	
	Section 42: The applicant has here set out his recollection of a number of contacts with council officers, dating back to 2009, in which he considers that they were abrupt in dealing with him concerning complaints of his dog straying from his own property. All of this material is irrelevant to the conviction.
	
	
	Section 43: This section comprises eight pages of summaries of complaints which it is asserted have been made against Sutherland Shire Council over a range of issues of town planning, environmental protection, financial corruption and many other subjects. All of these matters are entirely irrelevant to the conviction of the defendant on the subject charge.
	
	
	Section 44: This section is headed “Conclusion” and contains a wordy and repetitive summary, over 15 pages, of points that are made elsewhere in the 404 page document. Because this section involves a summary of topics that have been referred to and considered above, there is no necessity to address it separately.
	
	
	The letter of 4 December 2013 (item (2) at [25]) reiterates some of the matters already covered in the original 404 page summary. For example complaints about the magistrate not having taken account of the defendant’s medical condition are restated. Because of the repetitive nature of this letter it is not necessary to address its contents subject by subject.
	
	
	The applicant’s letter of 23 February 2015 is again repetitive. The only additional material in it is a submission about a statement of claim that Mr Fischer filed in the District Court on 7 November 2013 claiming damages which he alleges resulted from the dog attack which was the subject of the prosecution. That statement of claim is manifestly irrelevant to the question of whether any special facts or circumstances have been demonstrated which would warrant action under s 79 with respect to this conviction.
	
	
	The 88 pages of submission in reply are, again, repetitive of material which is contained in the original 404 page application. They proceed by way of answer, point by point, to the Crown’s submissions. But overall they simply amount to further argument about what evidence should have been accepted by the magistrate and why, what evidence should have been rejected and so on. These were all matters for the appeal if it had been pursued.
	
	
	The submissions in reply, as with the original 404 page document, include a number of criticisms by the applicant of the legal representative who appeared for the defendant before the magistrate. It is asserted that he should have obtained certain documents on subpoena, that he should have led additional evidence which in the event he chose not to lead and that he should have raised certain arguments. No special circumstance is identified in these respects. The inordinate detail, frequent irrelevance and general verbosity of the applicant’s submissions is such that one cannot identify from them any point or points which would clearly demonstrate a lack of competence or of integrity on the part of the defendant’s representative at the hearing, such as would warrant further action under s 79 to ascertain whether there may have been a miscarriage of justice.
	


Conclusion


	
	For these reasons I am not satisfied that there are “special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action” in relation to this application. Accordingly, pursuant to s 79(3) I refuse to deal with it.

		07 April 2016",2016-03-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2427513,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 41) [2016] NSWSC 364,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	On 29 March 2016 (which was day 40 of the present trial) Det. Phillips, who is the officer-in-charge of the investigation, was giving evidence before the jury. Det Phillips is one of the final witnesses to be called in the Crown case, which is expected to close in coming days.
	
	
	In the absence of the jury, the Crown indicated that he proposed to take Det. Phillips to the contents of a statement he had made on 22 March 2016 which was served on the representatives of each of the accused shortly afterwards. Ms Shead, on behalf of the accused McNamara, indicated that she would, in all probability, object to that evidence. That position was subsequently confirmed.
	
	
	To the extent that it is relevant for present purposes, the statement of Det. Phillips makes reference to alleged links between the deceased and a man known as Peter Hoang. Mr Hoang was apparently shot and killed in September of 2014. Det. Phillips spoke with detectives who were investigating Mr Hoang’s killing. He ascertained in October 2014 that there had been no identified link between Hoang and the deceased. That information was confirmed in February 2015. Those dates are of some significance, for reasons to which I will return.
	
	
	In order to understand the objection which has now been raised by Ms Shead, it is necessary for me to refer briefly to some aspects of the history of these proceedings.
	
	
	On 28 July 2015, this trial commenced before a jury. It is a matter of record that as a consequence of statements made in the opening address by counsel then appearing for McNamara the jury was discharged.
	
	
	It remains significant, however, in the course of that opening address, and specifically in the course of outlining the case for McNamara, counsel then appearing for him said this at T58 L10:
	


“The other matter was he was accused of skimming $130,000 of the drug money, and he told Mr McNamara that he had given that to a Mr Peter Hoang. Peter Hoang was a money launderer and a man whose activities were noted by police and a man who turned over quite a lot of money, millions of dollars, at casinos. He died later in the year, 2014, killed.”


	
	I pause to observe that at least on the basis of that part of counsel's opening, it must have been apparent that in all likelihood, McNamara would be called to give evidence in his case and would give evidence of the conversation with the deceased to which his then counsel responded.
	
	
	The present trial commenced on 1 February 2016. Ms Shead, who now appears for McNamara, opened her case to the jury on 2 February 2016. Between 28 July 2015 (when the previous jury was discharged) and 2 February 2016 (when Ms Shead opened her case) no evidence was served by the Crown which related to or established the absence of any link between Mr Hoang and the deceased. In those circumstances, Ms Shead opened to the jury (inter alia) in the following terms (commencing at T71 L9):
	


“Mr Gao told Mr McNamara that he was becoming increasingly worried about the Triads. He said that he was in danger of being killed unless he got some of the money he had skimmed off and given to a money launderer called Peter Hoang to hold, and unless he got that back, and handed it over, his life was in danger.”


	
	Ms Shead then continued at T72 L6:
	


“On 20 May Roger Rogerson contacted Glen McNamara and said he had spoken to Gao. He said that conversation had happened the day before and that he was meeting with Mr Gao and Mr Hoang. He said they later met Mr McNamara at Padstow McDonald's. McNamara said he was worried about the Triads and concerned about Mr Gao.”


	
	It will be noted that the terms of Ms Shead's opening in relation to alleged conversations between the deceased and Mr Hoang was generally consistent with the way in which the case had previously been opened by counsel then appearing for McNamara.
	
	
	It is against that background that the Crown now seeks to lead the evidence of Det. Phillips to which I have referred. The Crown does so, as I understand it, in order to rebut or attempt to rebut the suggestion that the deceased and Hoang had any contact at all.
	
	
	Ms Shead has objected to the Crown's reliance on the evidence and in doing so, has called in aid the provisions of s. 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”), which are in the following terms.
	


Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.


	
	The Crown submitted the evidence was necessary to be adduced in order to meet a part of the defence which had been foreshadowed on behalf of McNamara in the opening addresses to which I have referred. The Crown submitted, by reference to and authority to which I will come, that the facts of the present case were distinguishable in the sense that this was not a case where the Crown was simply seeking to lead evidence for its own purposes but was, rather, doing so in order to meet an anticipated defence in the manner that I have described. It was submitted that any delay in serving that statement was to be viewed in that light.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that I would not be satisfied that the conduct of the defence case on behalf of McNamara had been prejudiced in any way as a consequence of the late disclosure of the evidence. The Crown also sought to draw some relevant distinction between the Crown on the one hand and the investigating police on the other. As I understood it, whilst the Crown accepted that the material had been in the possession of the police for some period of time (a circumstance which was confirmed by Det. Phillips when he gave evidence before me this morning) the material had come into the possession of the Crown as recently as 20 March 2016.
	
	
	The Crown also took me to excerpts of the cross-examination of various witnesses by Ms Shead in the course of the trial, including Chun Kit Lam, Chun Lok Lam, Matthew Lo and Hubert Sha in order to demonstrate that the issue of Mr Hoang was a matter which had already been the subject of cross-examination.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances, the Crown's submitted that there was significant probative value in the evidence and no danger of unfair prejudice to McNamara if it were admitted.
	
	
	Ms Shead firstly submitted that it was significant that the information now relied upon by the Crown had been in the possession of the police since late 2014. She submitted that in those circumstances, there was no relevant distinction to be drawn between information in the possession of the police and information in the possession of the Crown Prosecutor.
	
	
	She also pointed out that evidence of the conversation between the deceased and McNamara would be led only for the purpose of establishing the fact that the conversation took place. She made it clear that it would not be relied upon, in any way, to establish the truth of what was said.
	
	
	Ms Shead also relied on the fact that the conversation which gives rise to this issue had been adverted to in the course of counsel's opening address in the first trial in July 2015. She submitted that in all of the circumstances it had been open to the Crown to provide the material after that time but before the commencement of the present trial, the Crown being effectively on notice that this would be an issue raised in the course of McNamara's defence.
	
	
	Ms Shead submitted that, in all of those circumstances, forensic decisions had been made for the purposes of conducting McNamara's case which may have been approached differently had the Crown's proposed reliance upon this material been known at the time that those decisions were made. She submitted that there was therefore a clear danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	Mr Thomas, on behalf of Rogerson, supported the Crown's position. He submitted that the probative value of the evidence was high, and that it had the capacity to rebut the assertion outlined in the course of the opening addresses. He also pointed to the fact that the evidence was of particular importance in circumstances where one of the parties to the conversation about which McNamara might be expected to give evidence was deceased.
	
	
	It is plain on the evidence before me that the material which is now sought to be relied upon by the Crown was known in some way, shape or form to the police as long ago as late 2014. The existence of the information was confirmed in February 2015. That was about five months before the commencement of the first trial.
	
	
	I am unable to accept the Crown's submission there is a relevant distinction to be drawn for present purposes between information within the knowledge of the police, and information which is within the knowledge of the Crown thereafter. I adverted to that issue in a judgment of the R v Rice (No 4) (2014) NSWSC 1525 where, I observed (at [20]) that in the circumstances of that case somebody involved in that investigation had been aware of material upon which the Crown wished to rely, notification of which had only been given to the accused at a very late stage of the trial. Although I did not specifically resolve the question on that occasion, the import of what I said was that there was no relevant distinction to be drawn.
	
	
	For obvious reasons, it is significant that the material was available but was not served. What is of particular significance in the present case is that the issue, having been raised in an opening address in July 2015 the Crown did not make the material known to those appearing for McNamara.
	
	
	Ms Shead relies on s. 137 of the Act. In Rice (supra) I made reference (at [32]) to a decision in Haoui v R (2008) 188 A Crim R 321; [2008] NSWCCA 209, where the Court of Criminal Appeal ordered a retrial in a case where late service of expert evidence had been given by the Crown. I observed (at paragraph [32]) that although that decision did not consider the provisions of s. 137 directly, the approach which had been taken by the Court provided some support for the proposition that procedural considerations of the type with which I am now dealing are capable, in a given set of circumstances, of giving rise to the kind of unfair prejudice to which s. 137 is directed.
	
	
	In my view, the probative value of the evidence is limited. The limitations on the probative value of the evidence arise largely from the circumstances in which, and the purpose for which, evidence will be led from McNamara in relation to this general issue. As I have said, the evidence will be led from him not to prove the truth of what was said but to prove the fact of what was said.
	
	
	Viewed in that way, I am unable to accept the Crown's submission that the evidence is necessary to ""meet"" a defence which has been foreshadowed or part of the defence which has been foreshadowed by McNamara.
	
	
	Moreover, I accept what I have been told by Ms Shead as to the possibility of different forensic decisions, being made if the accused had been on notice of this evidence. Needless to say, and as I pointed out in the course of an exchange in submissions, counsel is not obliged, in dealing with an issue such as this, to disclose in specific terms what counsel's instructions are, or what forensic decisions have been made in relation to the conduct of the trial. I am necessarily limited as to the extent which I am able to canvass those issues with counsel. I am left in a position where, to a large extent, I must accept what counsel tells me, in her capacity as an officer of the court, about what forensic decisions may or may not have been made in the course of conducting her client's defence.
	
	
	That said, it is not difficult to see, that one or other forensic decisions as to the conduct of the accused's case may well have been approached differently had this material been disclosed at an earlier time.
	
	
	I do not, in saying any of these things, intend any criticism of the police or the Crown. The fact is that in cases such as this, circumstances sometimes arise where, for a variety of reasons, material is served at a late stage. What must necessarily be at the forefront of my mind as the trial judge is the necessity to ensure all parties are given a fair trial.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the observations that I made in Rice, I am satisfied that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to McNamara in the sense that I have described.
	
	
	Having come to that view, s. 137 mandates that the evidence be excluded and that is the course that I propose to take.

		15 June 2016",2016-03-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2427553,Christopher John Courtenay v R [2016] NSWDC 42,"Judgment


	
	At about 1.00am on 30 august 2014 Christopher John Courtenay (the appellant) and his partner Valentina Jovanoska (the complainant) became involved in an argument in the unit in which they resided.
	
	
	The complainant alleged that in the course of that argument that the appellant assaulted her, by intentionally choking her and dragging her by the neck, by punching her to the left side of the face and by otherwise wrestling with her in an effort to take her mobile phone from her possession and/or to prevent her from leaving the unit. The appellant suffered a number of minor injuries in the course of the argument that were capable of being found to be actual bodily harm. At all times, the appellant denied choking the complainant, dragging her by the neck, punching the complainant, tackling her, throwing her to the ground or pinning her down.
	
	
	The appellant was later charged with one count of intentional choking contrary to section 37(1) Crimes Act 1900 and one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to section 59(1) Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The appellant pleaded not guilty to both charges and the matter came on for hearing before Ms Wahlquist LCM on 14-17 April 2015, 29-31 July 2015 and 1 September 2015.
	
	
	On 1 September 2015 the magistrate acquitted the appellant of the section 37 offence and convicted him of the section 59 offence.
	
	
	The appellant was fined the sum of $1,000 and ordered to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 12 months pursuant to section 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The magistrate also made a final Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (ADVO) for a period of 12 months making the standard orders and additional orders that the appellant not go within 50 metres of the premises where the complainant may reside or work and that the appellant not contact the complainant by any means except through her legal representative.
	
	
	The appellant appeals to this Court as of right against the conviction and the imposition of the ADVO.
	


Particularisation of the charge


	
	In the Local Court the prosecution did not particularise the precise acts or injuries that it relied on to establish the assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The prosecution case tended to focus on the complainant’s allegation that the appellant punched her 4 or 5 times in the left side of the face, but was not limited to this allegation. This is demonstrated in the magistrate’s decision on the section 59 offence. She ultimately rejected the appellant’s evidence by finding that it was implausible that he could provide an explanation for each of the minor injuries sustained by the complainant in the course of the argument.
	
	
	In the appeal, the prosecution particularised the assault occasioning actual bodily harm to be confined to the allegation that the appellant punched the complainant 4 or 5 times to the left hand side of her face and that the punches resulted in a contusion to the right of her left eye socket (the contusion). The contusion was best depicted in the photographs that became Exhibit 1 in the Local Court.
	
	
	As a result of that concession, which was entirely appropriate, the nature of the case to be considered by me is different to that considered by the magistrate.
	


Relevant law


	
	The applicable principles to be applied in determination of the appeal are as follows.
	
	
	Section 18(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides that the appeal is a rehearing on the certified transcripts of evidence, obviously as supplemented by reference to the exhibits tendered in the Local Court and is not an appeal de novo: Gianoutsas v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137 at [24]-[31].
	
	
	The principles governing appeals from judges sitting without a jury apply in that the appellate judge is to form his or her own judgement of the facts while recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called and observing the natural limitations stemming from proceeding wholly or substantially on the transcript record: Charara v R [2006] NSWCCA 244 at [17]-[22].
	
	
	Whilst the magistrate’s reasons are not part of the certified transcripts referred to in section 18(1), recourse may be had to them since the appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them: Charara [23]-[24].
	
	
	The Court is obliged to give the judgement which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance: Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118 at [23].
	
	
	Section 84 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 provides that an appeal may be made to the District Court against the imposition of an ADVO. The procedure adopted is that provided for by Part 3 Crimes (Appeal and Review Act) 2001 relating to conviction appeals with such modifications as are necessary or provided for in the Regulations.
	
	
	Section 16 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 provides that an ADVO may be made if the Court is satisfied that the applicant has reasonable grounds to fear and in fact fears the commission of a personal violence offence by the defendant or engagement in conduct by the defendant that intimidates the applicant or amounts to stalking, that is sufficient to warrant the making of the order. It is not necessary for the applicant to in fact fear that an offence will be committed if the Court is of the opinion that the applicant has been subjected to conduct by the defendant amounting to a personal violence offence and that there is a reasonable likelihood that the defendant may commit a personal violence offence and the making of the order is necessary in the circumstances to protect the person from further violence. Conduct may amount to intimidation even though it does not amount to actual or threatened violence and it consists only of damage to property. The matters require proof on the civil standard of the balance of probabilities.
	


Material considered on the appeal


	
	The prosecution tendered the transcripts of the proceedings before the magistrate on the dates I have outlined and the relevant exhibits.
	


Analysis of the magistrate’s reasons


	
	The magistrate noted that the prosecution case depended on the evidence of the complainant. She then summarised the complainant’s evidence in terms that were uncontroversial and which I will not repeat.
	
	
	The magistrate noted the inconsistencies between the complainant’s police statement, compiled on the night, and the evidence she gave in the Local Court. Of most significance was the inconsistency said to be introduction in her evidence of a second episode of intentional choking on the bed.
	
	
	The magistrate noted that the complainant was cross-examined for 2 days and that there was evidence that she was clearly distressed on the night when she made the police statement.
	
	
	The magistrate considered that the photographs of the injuries in Exhibit 1 provided some support for the complainant’s version of events, as did the evidence of complaint to her father.
	
	
	The magistrate referred to the evidence of the neighbours. One of the neighbours could not come to Court but her statement was tendered (Exhibit 4). She heard a female voice say words to the effect “Get away from me” and “Keep away from me” and a male voice say words to the effect, “I’ve just come home what’s wrong with you?” She then heard a door slam loudly. A male neighbour, who lived in the flat above the appellant and the complainant was called to give evidence. He was awoken by shouting and then he looked at his mobile phone. He went out onto his balcony. He heard a female voice saying “Don’t touch me; Stay away from me” and a male voice saying “I’m just back; I’ve done nothing wrong”. He said that the shouting was all around the unit and that it did not stop. He did not hear any secondary sounds consistent with a struggle.
	
	
	The magistrate referred to the evidence of the complainant’s general practitioner, Dr Godfrey. Dr Godfrey was given a history that the complainant had been punched in the left cheek, that she had been thrown against a wall and hit her left elbow, and that she had been thrown on a bed and there was an attempt to strangle her. Dr Godfrey palpated the complainant’s throat and thought that she was tender in that region. Dr Godfrey was of the opinion that the injuries were consistent with the history given. She accepted in cross-examination that she was not a forensic pathologist.
	
	
	The magistrate then turned to the appellant’s case. The appellant called Professor Duflou, a forensic pathologist. The magistrate summarised his evidence as being that if the complainant was choked as she alleged that he would have expected the presence of more significant and/or serious injury. He opined that the contusion was unlikely to have been occasioned by 4 or 5 punches because it was unlikely that she would have remained still and the injury would have been sustained over a more extensive area. He was of the opinion that the contusion could have been caused by the complainant falling against the wall, when the appellant and the complainant became entangled (the 2 person fall). The appellant gave evidence that this is how the fall occurred near the front door.
	
	
	The magistrate noted that the appellant called character evidence from his ex-wife, a friend and his mother. Each of the character witnesses described the appellant as not aggressive or violent, even if he was intoxicated. The magistrate also noted that the appellant had no prior convictions.
	
	
	The magistrate referred to the evidence of one of the police officers that saw the appellant on the day after the argument to the effect that the appellant was shocked when the allegation of assault was made, that there was no sign of a struggle in the unit and no sign of injury to the appellant.
	
	
	The magistrate then referred to the appellant’s evidence, which I will not repeat. Again her summary was uncontroversial.
	
	
	The magistrate made limited credit findings. In relation to the complainant, the magistrate stated that she held up reasonably well under cross-examination. She gained the impression that there were some parts of the evidence where she was unsure of the order of events. The magistrate made allowance that she was distressed on the night she made her statement to the police and that although there were some inconsistencies the magistrate did not consider them to be significant.
	
	
	In relation to the appellant the magistrate said that he was not dissuaded in his testimony by cross-examination. She did not find anything about his demeanour that detracted from his evidence.
	
	
	The magistrate correctly identified that she needed to examine the accounts and the independent evidence to determine if she could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution had proved its case.
	
	
	The magistrate accepted Professor Duflou’s evidence and decided that she could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the choking as described by the complainant occurred, because the injuries were not what the Professor expected them to be. The magistrate found that the only injuries depicted in the photographs in Exhibit 1 relevant to the intentional choking allegation were red marks under her chin.
	
	
	On the section 59 charge the magistrate considered the complainant’s injuries were consistent with her account. She then stated that the appellant’s account was that the complainant was behaving hysterically and that he grabbed hold of her to protect her from herself as implausible, particularly considering that there was no evidence that she had ever behaved similarly in the past.
	
	
	The magistrate rejected Professor Duflou’s evidence about how the contusion may have been caused by the complainant falling against the wall. Before drawing that conclusion, the magistrate did not make an express finding as to how the fall occurred, i.e. in accordance with the complainant’s evidence or the appellant’s evidence. Implicitly, she rejected the appellant’s evidence but did not give a reason for doing so. By reason of the way the appeal was conducted, by the prosecution relying on the contusion as the injury required to establish the element of actual bodily harm this evidence was significant. In my decision if I find that it was a reasonable possibility that the contusion was inflicted in the 2 person fall described by the appellant in his evidence, then I must acquit him of the section 59 offence.
	
	
	The magistrate noted that the complainant suffered a series of injuries and she did not accept the appellant’s version of how all of them occurred by him restraining her in the course of an episode of hysteria. As a result of the way that the appeal was conducted, I cannot rely on this aspect of the magistrate’s reasoning.
	
	
	The magistrate made no findings as to credit based on demeanour. She did not therefore have an advantage arising from seeing and hearing the witnesses.
	
	
	The magistrate noted the evidence given by the character witnesses and that the appellant relied on good character but did not direct herself as to how she should make use of that evidence.
	


Consideration


	
	Having conducted an independent assessment of the evidence before the Local Court, I have a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt of the offence of which he was found guilty. I do not consider that the magistrate’s finding is explicable by her advantage in seeing and hearing the witnesses: M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494. The reasons for my finding of reasonable doubt are as follows.
	
	
	First, the appellant’s acquittal of the section 37 offence makes it difficult for me to see how the complainant’s evidence could be accepted on the section 59 count: R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at [189]-[191].
	
	
	The complainant gave a detailed and passionate account of the intentional choking at the hands of the appellant. He lifted her off the ground and was squeezing really hard. She could not breathe or make a noise other than a gurgling noise. The pressure was getting stronger and stronger and she felt dizzy. He “dragged” her by the neck back into the bedroom and did not release the pressure on her throat until throwing her onto the bed.
	
	
	When she was on the bed he pinned her down with his body and strangled her again. This second episode was not in her police statement.
	
	
	Professor Duflou a forensic pathologist opined that the injuries depicted in the photographs that became Exhibit 1 and were noted by Dr Godfrey were not consistent with the complainant’s account. He opined that on the basis of the complainant’s evidence that it would have been quite reasonable to see bruising of the neck and fractures of the hyoid or thyroid cartilage, particularly where the complainant’s evidence was that the pressure on her neck was so intense that she could not speak during the choking episodes.
	
	
	The magistrate accepted the Professor’s evidence and could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a choking occurred as she described and acquitted the appellant of the section 37 offence.
	
	
	In my view, the magistrate’s finding brought into question the honesty of reliability of the complainant’s evidence. The introduction by the complainant of the second episode of choking on the bed in her evidence that was not contained in her police statement also gave me cause for concern that the second episode of choking was a matter of recent invention.
	
	
	Her evidence about desperately trying to get the appellant’s hands of her neck by “scratching” at his hands was also not supported by any injury being occasioned to the appellant’s hands. The appellant’s hands were examined by a police officer later in the day and photographs of his hands were taken by his brother shortly after he was released from the Kings Cross Police Station.
	
	
	The contusion was not consistent with the complainant being punched 4 or 5 times by the appellant because there was no evidence of injury to his hands and it was not what Professor Duflou would have been expected to have been inflicted on the basis of the complainant’s evidence. Professor Duflou opined that if the complainant was punched 4 or 5 times in the face even with moderate force he would have expected more injury in particular significant underlying injury to the eye socket by way of a bony injury such as a fracture and at least more significant bruising. He gave evidence that it was unlikely that in the heat of an attack such as the one described by the complainant that she would have remained still enough to allow the multiple punches to impact the same area of her face. This led Professor Duflou to conclude that if she had been punched multiple times as described that the injuries she sustained would have been to a larger surface area of her face. He described her injuries as “surprisingly little” and he would have expected significantly more injury if her account was correct.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that the injury to her left elbow was so significant that when she fell back against the wall that she noticed there was blood smeared all over the wall. This evidence was inconsistent with the observations of the minimal amount of blood on the elbow area of her jumper and the observations of the police at the unit who did not observe any signs of the struggle including the presence of any blood on the wall adjacent to the front door of the unit.
	
	
	The evidence of the male neighbour was also consistent with the appellant’s version of events in the following respects. First, what he heard the appellant say on a number of occasions was words to the effect “I’ve done nothing wrong” which was consistent with the appellant’s version of events and also consistent with the fact that at that point in time he had not punched her in the face on a number of occasions. Second and most importantly in my view, the male neighbour did not hear any sounds that were consistent with there being a long and extended physical fight as was described by the complainant in her evidence.
	
	
	There were also significant inconsistencies between the complainant’s police statement and her evidence in the Local Court. Those inconsistencies appeared to me to be self-serving and an effort to bolster her account. The most significant of these matters was the allegation in her evidence of the second episode of choking. Other examples included giving evidence that the “sole purpose” of opening balcony door of the bedroom was so that the neighbours could hear what was happening, but in her police statement stating that she opened the balcony door to jump off the balcony.
	
	
	Each of these matters in combination leads me to the conclusion that I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the complainant’s version of events.
	
	
	Second, there was a reasonably available alternate hypothesis as to how the complainant received the contusion. The complainant’s evidence was that the appellant threw her against the wall at which time she suffered an injury to her left elbow. The appellant gave evidence that when they were near the front door they became entangled and then both fell into the wall.
	
	
	Professor Duflou opined that the contusion could have been sustained by the complainant on either version of the fall. He said that it was more likely that the contusion was sustained in the 2 person fall than if the complainant’s version of events was accepted.
	
	
	I have already found that the contusion is inconsistent with the complainant’s version of events. Taking into account the evidence of the complainant, the appellant and Professor Duflou on this issue I am satisfied that there is a reasonable possibility that the contusion was occasioned in the 2 person fall as described by the appellant in his evidence.
	
	
	Accordingly I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the element of the offence being the actual bodily harm occasioned was caused by the assault alleged by the prosecution.
	
	
	Third, the appellant has always denied the allegations. Senior Constable Doxakis gave evidence that the appellant appeared to be genuinely surprised when he first heard the allegations against him. The appellant raised his character. He is a man with no prior convictions and he called positive testimony of good character to the effect that he was not a violent person and particularly he had not conducted himself in the past in any way that could be consistent with having a tendency towards domestic violence.
	
	
	The magistrate failed to direct herself as to the use that should be made of this evidence. The appellant was entitled to rely on his good character to prove that he was not the type of person to commit an offence and that he was likely to tell the truth to the Court when giving evidence.
	
	
	In my view the benefit to the appellant of the evidence of his good character should have been significant. The appellant’s good character was not given appropriate weight in the Local Court proceedings. Taking into account the appellant’s good character and the use to which I can put it in determining this matter would be also sufficient for me to have a reasonable doubt concerning his guilt of the section 59 offence.
	
	
	The orders I make on the conviction appeal are:
	



	
	Appeal against conviction is allowed.
	
	
	I set aside the conviction and the penalty imposed by the magistrate on 1 September 2015.
	


Appeal against the imposition of the ADVO


	
	The magistrate presumably made the Apprehended Domestic Violence Order on the basis that she had convicted the appellant of a personal violence offence as defined by the legislation. As I have set aside the convictions I must consider the requirements of the section afresh.
	
	
	My findings on the inconsistency of her evidence as to the injuries that she alleged she suffered, are sufficient for me to reject her evidence in its entirety when she alleged that she was intentionally choked or punched. I am not even satisfied on the balance of probabilities that those things occurred.
	
	
	I have carefully considered the appellant’s evidence and I prefer it to the evidence of the complainant whenever it is in conflict. In so doing I am mindful that I did not see or hear the witnesses give their evidence, but for the reasons expressed the magistrate did not make credit findings that prevent me from doing so.
	
	
	The evidence establishes that there was a heated argument. On the appellant’s own evidence he touched the complainant when she did not want him to. That would ordinarily be considered to be a battery. The contact with her was sufficient to cause her minor bruising in a number of areas. I accept that he probably believed his actions were necessary at the time to prevent her from leaving the unit in an agitated state. They were probably not entirely reasonable as they had the effect of causing her harm and they did not achieve a resolution of the situation.
	
	
	There has been no further contact between the appellant and the complainant.
	
	
	The provisional order was in place from 30 August 2014. The Final Order has been in place since 1 September 2015. In other words the appellant has been the subject of the order for a period of 18 months and has observed its terms in that period
	
	
	Having considered sections 16 and 17 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the appellant engaged in conduct that amounted to a personal violence offence namely a common assault, however the conduct was such that it was insufficient to warrant the making of an order. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there is no reasonable likelihood that the appellant will commit a personal violence offence against the complainant in the future and the making of an order is not necessary to protect her from further incident.
	
	
	The orders I make on the ADVO appeal are:
	



	
	Appeal against the imposition of the ADVO is allowed.
	
	
	I set aside the order made by the magistrate on 1 September 2015.

		07 April 2016",2016-04-04 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2427734,"R v Smith, Jarad [2016] NSWCCA 75","Judgment


	
	McCALLUM J: I have read the judgment of R A Hulme J. The reasons stated by his Honour reflect my own reasons for joining in the order dismissing the appeal.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Jarad Michael Smith (“the respondent”) was sentenced by his Honour Judge McClintock SC in the District Court at Sydney on 13 November 2015 for two offences of aggravated dangerous driving causing death. He asked the judge to take into account his guilt for a further offence of failing to stop and assist after a vehicle impact causing death.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for aggravated dangerous driving causing death is imprisonment for 14 years: s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). There is also a mandatory period of licence disqualification of 3 years. An offence of failing to stop and assist after a vehicle impact causing death carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years: s 52AB(1) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. His Honour indicated that if he had imposed individual sentences for the offences they would have been 6 years 3 months for one (taking into account the additional offence) and 6 years for the other.
	
	
	The sentence was specified to commence on 19 September 2015. It was backdated to take into account a period of pre-sentence custody, the applicant having been refused bail on 15 December 2014. He was granted very strict conditional bail in the Supreme Court and was released on 6 February 2015.
	
	
	The Crown appeals against the sentence pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on the ground that it is manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	A mandatory period of disqualification from driving applies to each of the offences pursuant to Ch 7 Pt 7.4 Div 1 of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW). The sentencing judge made a disqualification order when the matter came back before him on 25 November 2015. At the hearing of the appeal there was a discussion about whether the disqualification order was correctly made pursuant to the provisions of the legislation (see in particular s 206A). However, as the Crown appeal was not concerned with the disqualification period no more needs to be said about it.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the hearing the Court ordered that the Crown appeal be dismissed. The following are my reasons for joining in the making of that order.
	


The offences


	
	The facts of the respondent’s offences were undisputed. He went to a Christmas party at his work place at Rozelle on Saturday 13 December 2014. Between 9.30pm and 11.00am the following day he had numerous alcoholic drinks (beers, vodka and shots of tequila); he snorted two “lines of cocaine”; and he had a drink that he said he was later told was “spiked with ice” although in fact it was likely spiked with ecstasy.
	
	
	At 11.05am on Sunday 14 December 2014 the respondent drove his car along Victoria Road, Rozelle; a mixed commercial and residential area. He had a P2 (green) provisional licence and was not allowed to drive with any alcohol in his system. Traffic conditions were medium, the weather was fine and sunny and the road was dry. The car had no mechanical faults.
	
	
	After driving for about a kilometre the car mounted the kerb when travelling at about 30 to 40 km/h. 47 year old Catherine Pracy and her partner, 49 year old Gary Kelley were walking along the footpath. The respondent’s car collided heavily with them. Ms Pracy died instantly and Mr Kelley suffered critical head and internal injuries. He never regained consciousness and he died that evening.
	
	
	Immediately after the collision the car hit a large pot plant and the side of a building before pulling sharply back onto Victoria Road into the bus lane where it came to a stop further down the road. Bystanders approached. The respondent got out of his car and appeared to one witness as “dazed and almost in shock”. He then ran away. He was found a short distance away seated behind some tall plants in the back yard of a home in a nearby street. He was mumbling and slurring his words, his eyes were glassy and he smelt of alcohol. He admitted hitting the victims, said he was sorry and offered his phone so that police could be called. On arrest soon afterwards he immediately admitted his offences, revealed that he had consumed drugs and expressed his remorse.
	
	
	Testing revealed he had a blood alcohol concentration at the time of the collision within a range of 0.179 to 0.239 with the most likely concentration being between 0.201 and 0.210. Dr Judith Perl (a pharmacologist) said that for all people with that blood alcohol concentration there would be a very substantial impairment of driving ability. Low levels of prohibited drugs detected on testing would not have significantly affected the respondent’s driving ability aside from increasing his level of drowsiness after the stimulatory effects diminished.
	
	
	The respondent was interviewed by police. He said that he did not remember being in the car at all; the last thing he remembered was walking towards it with some companions. The next thing he remembered was being breath tested. When asked about his level of intoxication he said “11 out of 10, I was pretty drunk”.
	
	
	The judge noted that in the respondent’s evidence in the sentence proceedings he said that prior to the collision he had been “tooted” at a set of lights. His Honour concluded that this indicated he had fallen asleep. He further concluded that the respondent had fallen asleep moments later, immediately before the impact.
	
	
	His Honour also noted the respondent’s evidence that he became fearful of the understandable reactions of the bystanders who were upset and angry and were screaming and swearing at him. The respondent had said that he was in shock and became fearful of what might be done to him and that is why he ran away; not so as to avoid a breath test but because he was intimidated.
	


The impact of the offences


	
	The judge received family victim impact statements from Ms Louise Miller and from Erica and John Binder, the sister and the parents of Catherine Pracy. The depth of grief and despair they have experienced is impossible to imagine. Words can scarcely describe it. The family, friends, and anyone who knew them have obviously paid a heavy price for the loss of Catherine Pracy and Garry Kelley in such tragic and inexcusable circumstances. There is no suggestion that McClintock SC DCJ was unmindful of this.
	
	
	Sentencing in cases such as this is probably one of the hardest tasks that befall a judicial officer. Haesler SC DCJ observed in R v McKeown [2013] NSWDC 22 at [5]:
	


“In matters such as this Judges are asked to perform an impossible equation. No life can ever be equated with a period of imprisonment; no gaol term can return a loved one; and a life should never be measured simply by the punishment meted out to the offender.”


	
	However, Parliament tells judges through s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) that the purposes of sentencing include providing for adequate punishment, recognising the harm done, denouncing the offender’s conduct, making him or her accountable for what was done, and deterring the offender and others. Judges, of course, have a sworn (or affirmed) duty to apply the law as provided by Parliament. As Haesler SC DCJ went on to observe in R v McKeown at [17]:
	


“While every Judge has an individual sentencing discretion, that discretion must be informed by proper principle, and those principles should be applied consistently.”

The personal circumstances of the respondent


	
	The respondent was 22 years old at the time of the offences. He attained a provisional driver’s licence at the age of 20. He had no previous convictions or infringements for driving offences. He had no previous criminal convictions.
	
	
	Ms Danielle Hopkins, a clinical psychologist, assessed the respondent and her report was tendered in the sentence proceedings. The history provided by the respondent included that he was the youngest of four children. His father committed suicide when he was aged two. He grew up in a Department of Housing block of flats in Randwick where he was exposed to an antisocial environment of drugs, alcohol and aggression but his mother was protective of him.
	
	
	The respondent achieved below average marks at school. He was diagnosed with ADHD at about the age of 13 and was prescribed Ritalin. He described being bullied at school. He became rebellious in his mid-adolescence. He was suspended from high school on three occasions. After he attained his School Certificate in Year 10 he was asked not to return. He undertook some apprenticeships; ultimately commencing an apprenticeship in carpentry which led to his employment in the position he was in at the time of the offences. After being released on bail he worked as a volunteer in a canteen for the homeless and occasionally in demolition.
	
	
	The respondent has had one serious relationship. He lived with his partner for about a year. He found the end of the relationship traumatic and he returned to live with his mother. He used alcohol to cope. He described binge drinking on a weekly basis. He told Ms Hopkins that he had not consumed alcohol since the offences. (I note that it was a condition of his bail that he not consume alcohol.)
	
	
	The judge noted that the respondent had limited experimentation with illegal drugs prior to the offending which his Honour thought made his use of drugs on that occasion out of character. He had sought treatment for his abuse of alcohol. He said he was at a loss to explain his decision to drive in the state he was, claiming that he had never done it before. His Honour considered that from the regret and empathy he had expressed to Ms Hopkins he was clearly remorseful; he said at one point, “If I could change places with [the victims] I would. I’m so ashamed of myself.”
	
	
	The judge noted that the respondent had a history of anxiety attacks going back to when he was very young and he appeared to have developed post-traumatic stress disorder as a reaction to his offending. He also referred to Ms Hopkins having concluded her report with a series of recommendations for psychological management of the respondent in custody and in the community.
	
	
	Another psychological report by Jane Maher and Christina Reid was tendered in the respondent’s case. They had contact with him when he attended the Come In Youth Resource Centre soon after his release on bail in February 2015. He had self-referred for assistance with alcohol abuse. He said he was not currently drinking due to his bail conditions but added that he had no desire to do so. He had difficulty articulating his thoughts and feelings but it was noted that this improved over time. The report spoke of the work that had been done in helping the respondent to work through the consequences of the offences. He was described as being overwhelmed by the enormity of what had happened and how it had affected so many people. The report said that work on this subject will be long term.
	
	
	Like the report of Ms Hopkins, this report included expressions of remorse by the respondent such as, “I wish I had died instead of the victims”. He was considered to be greatly distressed knowing that he had caused the death of two people.
	
	
	A letter by the respondent and nine character referees were summarised by the judge as confirming “his sincere remorse and contrition and the efforts he has made to rehabilitate himself, and his otherwise good character”.
	
	
	Referring to the respondent’s evidence at the sentence hearing, the judge considered that he was sincere and that he presented in a manner that was consistent with the description of him in the reports. He gave a history of never driving whilst intoxicated which the judge accepted. He said his plan for the evening of the Christmas Party was to get a taxi home and he could not explain why he did not. He said he had no idea where he was going when he drove, or why he drove.
	
	
	The judge also referred to the respondent’s evidence as to his experience in custody when he was refused bail. He had been locked in a cell at the Surry Hills police station for 24 hours per day for 14 days before he was transferred to Long Bay where he witnessed a person being stabbed. It was described as the hardest time of the respondent’s life but he was aware he had to go to gaol when sentenced.
	
	
	His Honour accepted the respondent’s evidence that he was devastated and ashamed of what he had done and that he knew that “sorry” was not good enough. It was found that the respondent was “profoundly sincere and empathetic”.
	


Findings relevant to the assessment of sentence


	
	The judge reduced the sentences by 25 per cent from what he would otherwise have imposed on account of the respondent's early pleas of guilty. That is long-established sentencing practice.
	
	
	He took into account the respondent’s lack of any prior record for driving or criminal offences and accepted that he was a person of otherwise good character.
	
	
	The respondent’s rehabilitation was found to be “well underway” and the judge noted the support he had in the community. His prospects of rehabilitation were considered to be “excellent”.
	
	
	Submissions by the Crown that the offences involved a “high degree of abandonment of moral responsibility” on the respondent’s behalf were accepted. His Honour also accepted that there was a “need for a message to the community of a very strong degree of disapproval for the conduct involved”. General deterrence was stated to be a ""major factor"" and a ""fundamental consideration"" in the assessment of sentence. Punishment and denunciation were also regarded as relevant factors.
	
	
	Personal deterrence of the respondent and protection of the community (also included in the purposes of sentencing listed in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) were found to be less significant on the basis that his Honour considered that the respondent “appears to have been severely chastened and the process seems to have led to much greater maturity”.
	
	
	The judge found that the offence arising from the respondent leaving the scene without offering assistance was “towards the bottom of the range” of objective seriousness which did not contribute greatly to the respondent’s moral culpability. This was a finding undoubtedly informed by his Honour’s acceptance of the respondent’s explanation.
	
	
	The sentencing guideline judgments in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252 were considered with his Honour comparing the features of the typical case there considered with the facts of the case at hand. He noted (correctly with respect) that the guidelines are not prescriptive and there remained a need for the sentencing discretion to be exercised in a manner appropriately befitting the unique circumstances of the case at hand.
	
	
	His Honour described the objective gravity of the two primary offences as follows:
	


“[T]he objective gravity of driving a vehicle in the state in which the offender was, is high. He made a conscious decision to drive when he was highly intoxicated and barely capable of staying awake, let alone operating a motor vehicle with the necessary degree of caution or skill. He fell asleep moments after the journey began. From the moment he began driving, he was a danger to all road users and tragically to pedestrians.”


	
	In the light of this finding, his Honour also said:
	


“Assessed only by reference to its objective gravity and moral culpability of the offender which is high, this offending would attract a very substantial term of imprisonment. Two lives have been lost in utterly unnecessary and catastrophic circumstances. However, there are in the offender’s subjective circumstances, a number of matters that militate against a sentence of such severity that would be appropriate on the purely objective basis. I have mentioned some of these above. Included in these of course, are his excellent prospects of rehabilitation.”


	
	Other matters the judge identified as relevant to the assessment of sentence included the respondent’s relative immaturity (although he immediately noted that this type of offence is often committed by young persons who need to be deterred), his family support, the mental health impact upon him (post-traumatic stress disorder), and the circumstances of his upbringing which had involved a degree of deprivation.
	
	
	The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act mandates (in s 44(2B)) that ""the term of the sentence that will remain to be served after the non-parole period set for the aggregate sentence of imprisonment is served must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more"". The judge found that ""there are special circumstances including his first custodial sentence, in combination with rehabilitation and accumulation, and his youth"". I note that given a single, albeit aggregate, sentence was being imposed, there was in fact no accumulation. The Crown does not challenge this finding: see below at [56].
	
	
	By way of conclusion, the judge noted the difficulties in sentencing in cases of this type but at the same time acknowledged the duty that reposed in him to send a strong message of deterrence:
	


“It is never easy to send a young man to gaol for a considerable period of time, when he is a person who has never been in any significant trouble. However, one of the primary purposes of the law is to communicate that in circumstances like these, where you have driven drunk, there will be no escaping years and years of gaol. That is the unambiguous message of the law in this area … .”

Principles applicable to a Crown appeal against sentence


	
	The written submissions for the Crown helpfully provided the following summary of principles applicable to Crown appeals against sentence:
	


""A claim of manifest inadequacy requires the party advancing that complaint to establish that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust in a sentencing environment where there is no single “correct” sentence, and judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach: R v Dinsdale (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]; Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45, 242 CLR 520 at 538 [58].

It is acknowledged that the primary purpose of a Crown appeal against sentence is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons, and that this Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 retains a residual discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient: Green & Quinn v R (2011) 244 CLR 462; [2011] HCA 49 at [1].

It should be borne in mind that uniformity of sentencing is a matter of great importance in maintaining confidence in the administration of justice. Inadequate sentences give rise to a sense of injustice, not only in those who are the victims of the crimes in question but also in the general public and are likely to undermine public confidence in the ability of the courts to play their part in deterring the commission of crimes. To permit the Crown, as well as convicted persons, to appeal against sentences assists in maintaining confidence in the administration of justice: Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 306 per McHugh J.""

Crown submissions and response


	
	The Crown did not assert that there was any specific (patent) error disclosed in the sentencing judgment. However, it contended that there was latent error; the sentencing discretion must have miscarried because the sentence imposed:
	


(i)   fails to adequately reflect the objective criminality of the offences (which his Honour assessed as “high”);

(ii)    fails adequately to reflect the principle of general deterrence; and

(iii)    reflects an overly prescriptive approach to the guideline judgment in R v Whyte.


	
	It was submitted that such errors were evident in each of the indicative sentences and in the resultant aggregate sentence. More specific submissions were made on the following topics.
	


The offence taken into account


	
	The increase in the sentence for the first offence (3 months) was said to be a negligible reflection of the respondent’s criminality even accepting the finding that it was towards the bottom of the range of seriousness. That finding, to my mind, was well open to his Honour given the factual finding that underpins it which is not challenged.
	
	
	The respondent's evidence was to the effect that he did not run away to avoid a breath test and he was not hiding. The judge accepted that he was not trying to escape responsibility. He said, ""it would appear that he was not acting rationally, being both fearful and in shock"".
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the increment of 3 months was an inadequate response in his Honour’s discretionary assessment.
	


Regard to aggravating features


	
	The written submissions for the Crown acknowledged the role that guideline judgments have in the sentencing process. Spigelman CJ said in R v Whyte (at [113]): “A guideline is to be taken into account only as a ‘check’ or ‘sounding board’ or ‘guide’ but not as a ‘rule’ or ‘presumption’.”
	
	
	In R v Whyte, Spigelman CJ reiterated a number of aggravating factors he had identified in R v Jurisic and added two more. It was with obvious reference to these factors that the sentencing judge said:
	


“There was no evidence of excessive speed or competitive driving. There was no evidence of ignoring any specific warnings not to drive although he must have been aware that he was intoxicated.”


	
	The Crown submitted, “when an offender was so heavily intoxicated that he could not even function properly it might be asked, ‘what does it matter that he did not drive at high speed or for a long distance or take part in a drag race?’” This, it was contended, amounted to his Honour “focus[ing] so heavily on the absence of other aggravating features in assessing the respondent’s moral culpability rather than upon the respondent’s actual serious offending conduct”.
	
	
	I do not accept that the criticism is valid. As I read it, his Honour was simply identifying the aggravating features listed in the guideline judgment that were and were not present. Spigelman CJ referred in R v Whyte (at [228]) to the presence of one or more of the aggravating features tending to indicate that “the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct”. He said that another way of expressing such a conclusion is that “the moral culpability is high”. That is what McClintock SC DCJ found in the present case (see above at [39]-[40]). Reference to some aggravating features being absent did not divert his Honour from reaching the correct conclusion.
	


Regard to subjective circumstances


	
	Two criticisms were made of his Honour’s treatment of the respondent’s subjective case. First, reference was made to the portion of the judgment I have quoted above (at [40]). Secondly, it was said that his Honour “spent a significant portion of his Remarks addressing the respondent’s subjective circumstances (ROS 6-14). I do not accept either of these criticisms. There is nothing wrong with what his Honour said in the passage I quoted earlier. It really amounts to a statement of the obvious. As to the second matter, the time it takes to say something is not a reliable guide to the importance the matter is assigned in the assessment of a sentence.
	
	
	I note also that there was some tentativeness in the Crown’s submission about his Honour’s treatment of the respondent’s subjective case in that it was expressed in the following terms: “It appears that his Honour may have concentrated too heavily on the respondent’s subjective case” (emphasis added).
	


Finding of special circumstances


	
	The Crown did not challenge his Honour’s finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2B) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which brought about a reduction of the non-parole component of the sentence from the usual three-quarters of the total term. It is the extent of the reduction that the Crown challenged on the basis that the non-parole period is “only 57% of the total term”.
	
	
	It was accepted that the extent of the reduction following a finding of special circumstances is discretionary: Spark v R [2012] NSWCCA 140 at [34]. Reference was made to the judgment of Johnson J in R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240 where his Honour (with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J) said (at [118]):
	


“As the decision of this Court in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 (at 718 [65]) makes clear, the adjustment of the statutory ratio, after considering factors relevant to the fettered sentencing discretion, must lead to the imposition of a non-parole period which constitutes the minimum period which the offender should spend in custody having regard to all objective and subjective circumstances, including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence. The non-parole period should constitute the least period which the Respondent ought be required to serve for his crime before being eligible for parole, having regard to all the purposes of punishment and not simply his rehabilitation: Hejazi v R [2009] NSWCCA 282 at [36].”


	
	The Crown submitted that the 4 year non-parole period in this case was manifestly inadequate when regard is had to the findings by the judge concerning general deterrence and the “need for a message to the community of a very strong disapproval for the conduct”. It was submitted that a more modest reduction of the non-parole period would still have met the needs identified in the judge’s finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	It was crystallised at the hearing of the appeal that the Crown's complaint was really devoted to the asserted inadequacy of the head sentence which had a flow-on effect in yielding what it says is an inadequate non-parole period. In any event, I proposed to examine the criticism in its terms.
	
	
	The non-parole period is 4 years. If there had been no finding of special circumstances it would have been 5 years 3 months. The Crown accepts that the finding was open to be made. If the non-parole period had have been, say, 65 per cent, it would have been in the order of 4 years 6 months. At most, that signifies that the non-parole period is lenient, but not to a marked degree that amounts to discretionary error that calls for appellate intervention.
	


Application of the totality principle


	
	It was common ground before his Honour that there was a need to partially accumulate the two sentences. The Crown submitted that the degree of notional accumulation of the two indicative sentences amounted to a period of 9 months.
	
	
	The written submissions for the Crown cited the well-known authoritative statement of Howie J in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]:
	


“In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences.”


	
	The Crown submitted that the modest extent of the notional accumulation led to the imposition of an aggregate sentence that failed to reflect serious offending involving the death of two victims. It was said that the loss of one life brought about only an additional 9 months in the overall term and just over 5 months in the non-parole period.
	
	
	Saying that there was a notional accumulation of 9 months assumes accumulation of the 6 year sentence upon the 6 year 3 months sentence. If it was the other way around, the accumulation was notionally 12 months. But that is probably just a quibble.
	
	
	It is not really to the point to measure or estimate what ""notional"" accumulation there was. The key feature of the totality principle is the need to determine an appropriate total term of a sentence (or aggregate sentence) that is proportionate to the totality of criminality. That requires focus upon the primary issue in the appeal.
	


Is the aggregate sentence manifestly inadequate?


	
	These were very serious offences on any view. The respondent's moral culpability for them was appropriately assessed by the primary judge as high. However, the Crown did not, either in this Court or in the District Court, contend that the offences fell in, or close to, the worst case category. To put that in context, a case found to be “close to the worst type” was R v Wright v [2013] NSWCCA 82; 229 A Crim R 245 where the offender drove with a blood alcohol reading of 0.157 at speeds between 163 and 197 km/h over a distance of over 38km until the car ran off a major highway killing a 16 year-old passenger and very seriously injuring his 14 year-old girlfriend. The offender had an “appalling traffic history” including four prior high-range drink driving offences as well as multiple instances of driving whilst disqualified or whilst his licence was suspended or cancelled.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for an offence of aggravated dangerous driving causing death is 14 years. Judge McClintock SC assessed the appropriate sentence in each case as 6 years (putting aside the offence taken into account). In having regard to the maximum penalty, it must be borne in mind that the starting point before reduction on account of the respondent's pleas of guilty was 8 years.
	
	
	Care is required in the use of comparable cases and sentencing statistics: see, for example, Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 606 [59]; Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 244 CLR 520 at 535 [48]; and the useful summary of principles provided by Bellew J in Skocic v R [2014] NSWCCA 225 at [19]-[20].
	
	
	That said, a comparison with other cases may provide a guide as to the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past, although they do not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence. … They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"": Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 70 [304] (Simpson J (as her Honour then was)). These propositions were endorsed by the High Court in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen at 537 [54] and in Munda v State of Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 249 CLR 600 at 615 [39].
	
	
	Simply to provide an illustration of how courts in the past have approached the sentencing task in serious cases of dangerous driving causing death it is worth mentioning two of the cases that were referred to at the hearing. R v Morrow [2009] NSWDC 78 was a case in the District Court involving a 40 year-old sole parent of a 12 year-old son with no prior criminal record and described by the sentencing judge as being of “excellent character”. She tragically killed a husband and wife when she crossed to the wrong side of a highway when she had a blood alcohol reading of 0.161. Murrell SC DCJ (as her Honour then was) accumulated the two sentences for aggravated dangerous driving causing death by 12 months yielding a total effective sentence of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. When this case was raised with senior counsel for the Crown her submission was that the sentence was ""inadequate"". There was no Crown appeal (but I draw nothing from that because there may be a variety of reasons why the Crown may not do so in the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion).
	
	
	Gommesen v R [2012] NSWCCA 226 is another example of a tragic case of this type. The offender, who had a prior drink driving conviction, had been drinking alcohol at home, at a friend’s house, and then at a party before he drove a car into a power pole and killed a passenger who was his half-brother. He had a blood alcohol reading of 0.172. The sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months was held by this Court (at [60]) to be “within the broad range of penalties imposed for offences of this kind” and the appeal was dismissed. This was an appeal by the offender; not the Crown.
	
	
	The written submissions by Mr Dhanji SC for the respondent referred to a number of other cases for the purpose of comparison: R v Skrill [2002] NSWCCA 484; Berg v R [2004] NSWCCA 300; R v Pevy [2004] NSWCCA 414; R v Smith [2005] NSWCCA 19; Lawrence v R [2007] NSWCCA 349; R v Millwood [2012] NSWCCA 2. It is to be kept in mind that cases involving Crown appeals prior to the enactment of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) on 24 September 2009 must be considered with some caution.
	
	
	There is nothing to be achieved by spelling out a case by case review and comparison of each of them with the case at hand. It suffices to say that they are cases which, broadly speaking, have similarities with the present case in that they each involve serious examples of dangerous driving causing death. Viewing them in an overall and broad way they provide some measure of the types of sentences that have been passed in similar (not identical) circumstances.
	
	
	Acknowledging the very limited utility of the statistics, those maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales in respect of the offence of aggravated dangerous driving causing death indicate that a sentence of 6 years is 18 months above the median sentence that has been imposed in the 7 years to September 2015. An aggregate or total effective sentence of 7 years is a year above the median in the same period where an offender has been sentenced for more than one offence. (The latter is a less reliable indicator because it does not necessarily mean that the other offence(s) were of the same type.)
	
	
	The judgment of McClintock SC DCJ reflects very careful consideration of all relevant aspects attending the assessment of sentence and the Crown does not assert any specific, or patent, error. His Honour was obviously and acutely conscious of the essential aspect of the offences being the tragic loss of the lives of two entirely innocent people. But his Honour was also required to pass sentence in accordance with well-established principles and not merely with emotion.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown was correct (with respect) to point out that a stern measure of punishment was required having regard to the fact that through his complete abandonment of responsibility by driving when grossly affected by alcohol the respondent caused not one but two deaths. She particularly emphasised the need for there to be a strong measure of general deterrence in order to discourage others who may be tempted to drive in a state in which they present a substantial danger to others.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge was alive to these matters; he said so plainly and clearly. But he was also required to take into account matters personal to the respondent. Pertinent matters that could not be ignored included his age, lack of prior driving or criminal offences, genuine remorse, his mental condition and his excellent prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The High Court has recognised more than once that ""there is no single correct sentence"" and that ""judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies"": Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 371 [27].
	
	
	I was not persuaded that the aggregate sentence imposed by McClintock SC DCJ failed to reflect the totality of the respondent's criminality. For the Crown to make good its assertion of manifest inadequacy it was necessary for it to establish that the sentence is ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"". I was not persuaded that when all relevant objective and personal matters are taken into account, the sentence can be so characterised. I consider that this conclusion is confirmed by the statistical material and comparable cases to which I have earlier referred.
	
	
	It was for these reasons that I joined in the making of the order that the Crown appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2427862,Stuart v R [2016] NSWCCA 72,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Harrison J.
	
	
	HARRISON J: Mr Stuart seeks leave to appeal to this Court against the sentence imposed upon him by Garling ADCJ on 29 November 2013 on the single ground that his sentence, when compared to that imposed upon a co-offender Laurence Glover, gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.
	


Background


	
	Mr Stuart and Laurence Glover appealed unsuccessfully against their convictions to this Court: Glover v R; Stuart v R [2015] NSWCCA 285. The factual background to the charges faced by each man is conveniently summarised at [8] – [20] in the judgment of Basten JA as follows:
	


“[8]    Count 1 alleged the theft of a black Audi RS4 Avant station wagon MS 2530, which, together with the car keys, was stolen from the home of its owner on the night of 3 May 2011. Carr and Stuart (but not Glover) were charged with that offence, but were acquitted. There followed three robberies at hotels in the eastern suburbs of Sydney between 4 May and 7 June 2011. The prosecution alleged that the black Audi was used as a getaway car in each case. All three accused were charged in relation to each offence, the prosecution case being that Mr Carr drove the motor vehicle and Messrs Stuart and Glover entered the respective hotels.

[9]    The first robbery (counts 2 and 3) occurred at the Nelson Hotel on Oxford Street, Bondi Junction, shortly after 10pm on the evening of 4 May 2011. The two offences resulted from separate acts of robbery involving the deputy manager of the hotel, from whom an amount of some $10,000 was taken, and a bar attendant, from whom the contents of the bar till were taken, being a little under $4,000. In submissions, the two counts were referred to as the first robbery.

[10]    The second robbery (count 4) took place on the same evening at about 10.30pm at the Sands Hotel, Maroubra. An amount of $12,800 was taken from the general manager, who had been counting the daily tills at the time one of the offenders kicked in her office door.

[11]    The third and fourth robberies occurred some five weeks later, on 7 June 2011. The third robbery (count 5) involved the Rose of Australia Hotel at Erskineville. Two offenders entered the hotel at about 10.50pm and escaped with a small amount of money from a till (about $1,250). Some 15 minutes later, offenders robbed the Excelsior Hotel at Surry Hills, taking approximately $7,688 (count 6). Police were alerted to the robbery as it was taking place and drove in front of the Audi which was parked outside the hotel. In seeking to escape, the Audi was driven into the police vehicle, mounting the pavement and, as described by Constable Scrymgour, the Audi ‘climbed up and over the bonnet of the police vehicle’ before driving off. Police recovered a screwdriver which had been used by the offenders.

[12]    Prior to the robberies on 7 June, the black Audi with its correct number plates, MS 2530, had been observed in a secure underground car park in Cowper Street, Randwick. On 8 June 2011 a police officer inspected the vehicle, which then bore number plates AWC 07T.

[13]    On 10 June 2011, shortly after 9.00am, Mr Carr visited the police website on which there were details of the robberies at the Rose of Australia and Excelsior Hotels. On the morning of 27 June 2011, he again visited the website and accessed a media release relating to an armed robbery in Randwick. Shortly after midnight (on 28 June), the black Audi was taken from the car park in Cowper Street, driven to a nearby lane and set alight. Mr Carr was charged with destroying the Audi motor vehicle (count 7). Another person was also said to have been involved in the torching of the motor vehicle; neither Glover nor Stuart was charged with that offence.

[14]    On 4 July 2011 there was a break-in at a house in South Coogee, car keys were stolen from the house and the motor vehicle, another Audi, registration number BLE 66F, was stolen. Messrs Carr and Stuart were charged with breaking and entering the house and stealing the keys and the vehicle (count 8). Both were acquitted, but the stolen vehicle was involved in subsequent offences with which the three accused were charged.

[15]    A fifth robbery occurred on Monday, 18 July 2011 at the Malabar RSL. Shortly after the club opened (at about 11.30am) two men, alleged to be Glover and Stuart, entered the premises and required staff of the club to open a safe and an ATM from which approximately $94,550 was taken (count 9). A different staff member was required to empty money from a till: approximately $6,420 was taken (count 10). There was significant evidence linking Mr Stuart in particular to the robbery. That included CCTV footage taken two days earlier which revealed a number of people, including Mr Stuart, at the club and signing the visitor’s book, which he did in his own name.

[16]    Mr Stuart returned to the Malabar RSL on 5 September 2011, again signing in in his own name. At about 7.58am on Wednesday, 7 September 2011, two offenders entered the club, a third offender remaining outside in a stolen high performance Mercedes sports car, without registration plates. The two men who entered the club were wearing hooded jumpers and triangular handkerchiefs tied over their faces, but no balaclavas. No money was taken: the offence (count 11) was identified as attempted armed robbery with a dangerous weapon. Bradley Carr had been arrested on 12 August 2011 and remained in custody on 7 September. Messrs Glover and Stuart were charged in relation to this offence.

[17]    The final offence (count 12) occurred on 12 September 2011 when two men wearing hooded jumpers and masks entered the Regent Hotel, Kingsford shortly after 10am. An amount of some $59,000 was taken. A witness observed the men leaving the Hotel, both wearing hoods, one clutching a bag and the other an iron bar. They ran to a Mercedes sports car which drove them away. The witness took a note of the front number plate, AP 234, and called the police. Messrs Glover and Stuart were charged with this offence.

[18]    Various arrests and searches were made on 12 September 2011. A search warrant was executed at Stuart’s home in Pitt Street, Waterloo. Police located $5,000 in cash, a pair of red and black gloves, a key to a stolen Mercedes BNN 77U and a pair of Adidas black track suit pants with three white stripes down the leg. The cash was found in bundles held with elastic bands, said to be consistent with money taken from the Regent Hotel. Mr Stuart was arrested and interviewed at Redfern police station. He was charged with the Regent Hotel robbery. In formal admissions dated 5 June 2013 he admitted stealing the Mercedes BNN 77U.

[19]    Mr Glover was arrested at about the same time leaving premises on Gardeners Road, Kingsford, leased by his girlfriend, Dayna Jennings. He had $1,850 in his wallet and a key to his own motor vehicle, which was located at 43 Dacre Street, Malabar. The unit occupied by Ms Jennings at Gardeners Road was searched; the garage to the unit was also searched, revealing the stolen black Mercedes BNN 77U, displaying stolen plates AP 234. A pair of pink washing-up gloves which contained DNA consistent with that of Mr Glover was found in the vehicle. Similar DNA was found on an interior door handle in the Mercedes. A small black crow bar was located on the passenger side front floor. In addition, number plates from the stolen Audi BLE 66F were also located in the Mercedes.

[20]    The third man alleged to have been involved in the robbery of the Regent Hotel was Kane Hoskin. At 11.50pm on 12 September 2011, police attended at the Matraville home of Hoskin’s girlfriend, Siobhan Kelly. Hoskin was asleep in her bedroom, but was woken and arrested. Police asked if there was cash on the premises and were told there was no large amount present. After his arrest, the bedroom was searched and $18,100 was located in a gift box in the wardrobe, together with an additional $1,500 in a brown bag hanging from the bedpost.”


	
	Mr Stuart was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 16 years imprisonment commencing on 12 September 2011 and expiring on 11 September 2027 with a non-parole period of 10 years expiring on 11 September 2021. Mr Glover was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 11 years and 6 months imprisonment commencing on 12 September 2011 and expiring on 11 March 2023 with a non-parole period of 7 years and 2 months expiring on 11 November 2018.
	


Submissions


	
	Mr Stuart submitted that there was a lack of proportionality in the aggregate sentences imposed upon him and Mr Glover. That lack of proportionality was said to be so marked as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. For example, there was no difference at all in their respective culpability for the trial offences and “not a lot” of difference in their subjective cases. The only real differences were the additional charges faced by Mr Stuart and the fact that he was at the time on conditional liberty. Mr Stuart contended that those differences were insufficient to justify the disparate sentences.
	
	
	Mr Stuart also emphasised that his Honour indicated in the course of the sentencing proceedings that Mr Stuart’s sentences for the additional offences would be served concurrently and be accumulated by a term of 18 months on the common robbery charges. Mr Stuart submitted that while it was unusual for a judge to specify the amount of accumulation when imposing an aggregate sentence, his Honour’s comments served to demonstrate the extent of the difference between his sentence and that imposed upon Mr Glover. The further offences were also less serious than the trial offences.
	
	
	Mr Stuart conceded that the fact that he was on a community service order at the time was an aggravating feature unique to him. He submitted that it should aggravate his offending to a minor degree only, having regard to the nature of the charges and the seriousness of the offending. In summary, the 40 percent difference of 4 years and 6 months between the aggregate head sentences and 2 years and 10 months in the non-parole periods demonstrated such a marked lack of proportionality as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.
	


Consideration


	
	In his remarks on sentence concerning Mr Glover, his Honour adverted to the question of parity with his co-offenders Mr Stuart and Mr Carr in the following terms:
	


“I accept there are special conditions. He will need assistance when he leaves prison after a lengthy sentence. He has never been to gaol before and will need some help, and therefore I find special circumstances.

The next question is one of parity. Stuart and Carr, I have already sentenced them. The Crown case was that it was a joint criminal enterprise, that is, they all played a part in the armed robberies. It was an agreed and planned series of robberies. Each part was vital to the commission of the offences. Carr was the driver. Stuart and Glover go into the hotels and clubs. One has a gun, the other has a weapon. Carr was involved in aggressive driving, especially after the armed robbery at the Excelsior Hotel. Evidence clearly shows that Carr was fully involved. He knew one of the others was carrying a gun and the other another weapon, and knew exactly what was going on. Glover also was fully aware and taking part in what was going on. I believe that each played a similar role of importance in the carrying out of the offences and there is no difference in criminal responsibility.

It was submitted to me that Mr Glover played a lesser part. He was described at one stage as a gofer. I reject that submission. I am satisfied on the evidence in the trial that Glover was clearly involved to the same extent as the others. They were all involved in it together and that is why I am satisfied that there is no difference in criminal responsibility.

I sentenced Carr to 15 years with a non-parole period of nine years and four months, Stuart to 16 years with a non-parole period of ten years. Each had additional matters which Glover has not been charged with. Mr Glover was arrested and has been in custody since 12 November 2011.

There are some differences in the sentence. Mr Carr was not involved in the last two attempted armed robberies. However, he had to face other serious charges. He has a far more serious criminal record than Stuart and Glover. Carr was also convicted of arson of a motor vehicle. The offenders are roughly the same age. Mr Carr was on parole at the time, Stuart was subject to a community service order.” [Emphasis added]


	
	Correspondingly, when sentencing Mr Carr, his Honour said this in his remarks on sentence:
	


“The offenders are all about the same age. Mr Carr was on parole at the time. Mr Stuart was subject to a community service order. There are some differences in the subjective matters, but not a lot. Mr Stuart clearly is taking part in the robberies, and I have concluded that, as far as parity is concerned, the parts they played are all very similar and should be treated in the same way, that is, as far as the trial matters are concerned.”


	
	Mr Stuart pleaded guilty to two additional offences. The first was a charge of receiving a Mercedes motor vehicle stolen from Manning Road, Double Bay on 6 July 2011 that he subsequently stored in the garage of Jessica Mylne. That vehicle was under electronic surveillance at the time. The second was a charge of aggravated break, enter and steal on 9 August 2011 at Brighton-Le-Sands. Mr Stuart stole car keys with which he was then able to steal a high performance Mercedes motor vehicle which was later used in two of the offences for which he stood trial, being the attempted armed robbery at the Malabar RSL Club on 7 September 2011 and the armed robbery of the Regent Hotel on 12 September 2011. In sentencing Mr Stuart for these two offences, which were additional to those with which Mr Glover was charged, his Honour remarked as follows:
	


“As far as the other charges to which Carr and Stuart have pleaded guilty they should also be partially accumulated on top of the armed robbery charges. They are totally different offences.”


	
	It seems apparent that his Honour at all times had the issue of parity clearly in mind when sentencing all of these offenders. Mr Stuart therefore faces the considerable obstacle that his Honour was fully aware of the differences between and among these individuals and accordingly gave clear reasons for departing from the sentences imposed upon Mr Stuart and Mr Carr when he came to sentence Mr Glover: see Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398 at [28] and Loader v R; Dunn v R [2013] NSWCCA 215 at [91] – [95].
	
	
	The significant reason for the difference in the sentences is the additional offences for which Mr Stuart was sentenced. Mr Glover had no additional offences or any matters on a Form 1. By reference to the indicative sentences it is clear that his Honour intended Mr Stuart and Mr Glover to serve the same terms for the offences for which they had both been convicted. Mr Stuart was also subject to a community service order to which his Honour specifically referred in his remarks on sentence. However, it is also important to note that Mr Stuart was on a good behaviour bond at the time of the commission of the offences for which he stood to be sentenced. His Honour did not refer to that fact, and it amounts to a further feature of distinction between Mr Stuart and Mr Glover.
	
	
	Apart from his concern about parity, Mr Stuart makes no complaint that his Honour erred in any other particular respect, such as that he inappropriately accumulated sentences or failed properly to have regard to the principles applying to aggregate sentences. Mr Stuart does not contend that his sentence is manifestly excessive. Mr Stuart’s complaint about the percentage mark up on his sentence is not a separate complaint of error, as much as a method by which to emphasise or justify his sense of grievance.
	
	
	Mr Stuart’s argument in this appeal must necessarily confront what was discussed by Campbell JA in Jimmy v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [203] as follows:
	


“[203]    There are significant limitations, however, on reducing a sentence on the basis of that of a co-offender who has committed a different crime. At least some of the limits on the use of the parity principle in such a case are:

1.    It cannot overcome those differences in sentence that arise from a prosecutorial decision about whether to charge a person at all, or with what crime to charge them…

2.    If it is used to compare the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes, there can be significant practical difficulties. Those practical difficulties become greater the greater the difference between the crimes charged becomes, and can become so great that in the circumstances of a particular case a judge cannot apply it, or cannot see that there is any justifiable sense of grievance arising from the discrepancy…

3.    It cannot overcome differences in sentence that arise from one of the co-offenders having been given a sentence that is unjustifiably low…

4.    There are particular difficulties in an applicant succeeding in a disparity argument where the disparity is said to arise by comparison with the sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the applicant…” [Citations omitted]


	
	Mr Stuart’s head sentence is 4.5 years longer than Mr Glover’s and his non-parole period is 2 years and 10 months longer. The difference is referable to the two further offences with which Mr Stuart was charged and for which he was sentenced. Mr Stuart contended that the difference demonstrated a lack of proportionality that is so marked as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. I am however unable to agree.
	
	
	It is trite to observe that the sense of grievance that would warrant appellate intervention must be justifiable, not merely a general dissatisfaction with the fact that a co-offender in a series of joint criminal activities may for legitimate and understandable reasons not have received a comparable sentence. Mr Stuart was sentenced to a longer term of imprisonment than Mr Glover because he committed further offences. One of the additional charges faced by Mr Stuart that was not faced by Mr Glover, being an offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, carried a standard non-parole period of 5 years by itself.
	
	
	The sentence imposed upon Mr Stuart is not otherwise attacked. In the circumstances it is not possible to say that his Honour erred in sentencing comparable offenders to different terms of imprisonment. Mr Stuart has not demonstrated that there is any basis for him to have a justifiable sense of grievance in the circumstances.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	In my opinion the following orders should be made:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Harrison J.

2427922,Humphries v R; Ponfield v R (No. 2) [2016] NSWCCA 91,"Judgment of the COURT


	
	After judgment was delivered on this appeal on 13 May 2016 the solicitor for the DPP drew the Court‘s attention to two apparent errors in the judgment: Humphries v R; Ponfield v R [2016] NSWCCA 86 (the principal judgment).
	
	
	The first error at [7] was a reference to the expiry date for the sentence at first instance in respect of Mr Ponfield as 18 June 2017. The correct expiry date for the non-parole period was 18 March 2017.
	
	
	The second error was contained in order (3) that appeared at appeared at [73] and in the orders made by the Court. That order made reference to a non-parole period of three years six months commencing 19 January and expiring 18 October 2018.
	
	
	At [72] the judgment of Davies and Beech-Jones JJ (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL agreed) said:
	


Having regard to the objective seriousness of the offending, Mr Humphries’ subjective matters and the sentences imposed on Mr Ponfield and Mr Wilson, we consider that the appropriate sentence for Mr Humphries for each of the offences is a non-parole period of three years and nine months commencing 19 January 2015 and expiring 18 October 2018 with an additional term of two years and three months expiring 18 January 2021.


	
	The Court’s intention, as appears from that passage, was that Mr Humphries should be sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and nine months commencing 19 January 2015 and expiring 18 October 2018. The sentence was incorrectly recorded at [73] and subsequently in the orders made by the Court. The error should be corrected to reflect the Court’s intention. Order (3) should read:
	


(3)   In lieu, sentence the Appellant Mark Humphries to a sentence for each count comprising a non-parole period of three years nine months    commencing 19 January 2015 and expiring 18 October 2018 with an additional term of two years and three months expiring 18 January 2021. The sentences are to be served concurrently.


	
	The Court notes a further error in the principal judgment at [5]. The reference to the sentence imposed by Judge Arnott should have been to an additional term of two years and six months expiring 18 April 2021 instead of 18 January 2021.
	
	
	Rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952 (NSW) empowers the Court to correct the errors.
	
	
	An amended judgment correcting the three errors will be published.
	
	
	The orders of the Court are:
	



	
	The reference at [5] in the principal judgment to “18 January 2021” is amended to read “18 April 2021”;
	
	
	The reference at [7] in the principal judgment to “18 June 2017” is amended to read ”18 March 2017”;
	
	
	Order (3) at [73] and in the form of the sentence ordered by the Court on 13 May 2016 is amended to read:
	


In lieu, sentence the Appellant Mark Humphries to a sentence for each count comprising a non-parole period of three years nine months   commencing 19 January 2015 and expiring 18 October 2018 with an additional term of two years and three months expiring 18 January 2021. The sentences are to be served concurrently.


	
	The orders republished on 16 May 2016 stand as a consolidated statement of the orders of the Court.

		16 May 2016",2016-05-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2428154,Kennedy v R [2016] NSWCCA 114,"Judgment OF THE COURT:


	
	On 20 November 2010 Stanley Bruce Davies was brutally bashed at his Kempsey home. The house was ransacked.
	
	
	Mr Davies was not found until the following afternoon. He was taken by ambulance to Kempsey hospital and thereafter taken by air to the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle. He had extensive and irretrievable brain injuries consistent with multiple blows from a blunt object. On 26 November 2010 his life support was turned off.
	
	
	Three people were arrested and charged with his murder. On 8 December 2010 when a search warrant was executed by police on premises at Dondingalong Richard Smith was arrested and charged. On 27 June 2012 Steven Smith was arrested and charged. On 2 July 2012 the Appellant Raymond Kennedy was arrested and charged.
	
	
	On 1 February 2013 Richard Smith pleaded guilty to Mr Davies’ murder. On 5 April 2013 Steven Smith and the appellant were jointly ordered to stand trial on 7 June 2013 before the Supreme Court sitting at Port Macquarie. That trial date was later vacated. A new trial date was fixed for 18 November 2013.
	
	
	Steven Smith was re-arraigned on 2 October 2013 and entered a plea of guilty to the indictment charging him with Mr Davies’ murder. He also pleaded guilty to other unrelated offences.
	
	
	On 6 November 2013 the Appellant was arraigned before Barr AJ in the Supreme Court in Sydney. He entered a plea of guilty. The sentence proceedings were adjourned for hearing on 15 November 2013.
	
	
	On 15 November 2013 the sentence hearing commenced but was not finalised due to the need for two witnesses to attend to give evidence relevant to a factual dispute. The matter was further listed for a sentence hearing on 28 February 2014. On that date the two witnesses did not attend, and warrants were issued by the Court for their arrest. The matter was adjourned to 7 March 2014 for further hearing.
	
	
	On 7 March 2014 the Appellant withdrew his instructions to his legal representatives and indicated that he wished to withdraw his plea of guilty. The matter was further adjourned.
	
	
	In June 2014 the Appellant filed a Notice of Motion seeking leave to vacate the plea of guilty he had entered on 6 November 2013. The Motion was heard by Wilson J on 5 December 2014. On that day her Honour refused leave to withdraw the plea. She later gave her reasons for doing so: R v Raymond Kennedy [2014] NSWSC 1921.
	
	
	On 27 March 2015 Wilson J sentenced the Appellant to a non-parole period of 15 years and 9 months commencing 2 July 2012 and expiring 1 April 2028 with an additional term of 5 years and 3 months expiring 1 July 2033: R v Kennedy [2015] NSWSC 327.
	
	
	The Appellant now appeals on two grounds relating to the refusal of Wilson J to permit him to withdraw his plea:
	


Ground 1:   Her Honour erred in not allowing the applicant (sic) to withdraw his plea of guilty giving rise to a miscarriage of justice.

Ground 2:   There was a miscarriage of justice because the plea was not attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt to a properly identified basis for murder.


	
	He also seeks leave to appeal against the severity of his sentence on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1:   Her Honour erred in finding that the applicant knew that there was a 'house lined up' with Richard and Stephen Smith prior to the attending the premises (sic).

Ground 2:   Her Honour erred in relying upon the evidence of Ms Button and Ms Roe in the sentence proceedings.

Ground 3:   Her Honour erred in finding that the applicant ‘applied force to Mr. Davies'.

Ground 4:   The sentence was manifestly excessive.

The facts


	
	All of the facts relating to the offending were not agreed at the sentence hearing. The Crown tendered a summary of facts and the Appellant disputed the matters contained in paragraphs 4, 6, 7, 9, 22 and 23. It is necessary in the first instance to set out that summary of facts in its entirety. The disputed paragraphs appear in italics.
	


1.   Stanley ""Bruce"" Davies, (the deceased) was a 75 year old, living alone in his house at 2 Dangar Street, Kempsey. Within the house the deceased had a safe, in which he kept amongst other things a collection of coins. Within the house were other safes or secure storage devices, including a gun safe.

2.   The offender, Raymond Kennedy (DOB: 20/04/1992) was an associate of Steven Smith and Richard Smith who are cousins. Richard Smith is known by the nick name ""Poochy"". The offender, Richard Smith and Steven Smith were all residents of Kempsey or its environs as at November 2010.

3.   At 6pm on the evening of Friday 19 November 2010 a friend attended the residence of the deceased and spoke with him. The deceased was uninjured at the time.

4.   In the early hours of that evening the offender Raymond Kennedy left his home indicating he was going to see Richard Smith and have a drink. He was wearing a pair of Nike TN joggers. The offender said that Richard Smith had a house he intended to rob and that there was a safe and valuable coins in the house.

5.   At about Midnight neighbours of the deceased heard banging sounds, consistent with something being hit coming from the home of the deceased. It sounded like a door slamming. After a short time more banging was heard, which Zalie Davison, who lived opposite the deceased, described as dull like it was made on timber not metal.

6.   At about that time the offender, Richard Smith and Steven Smith attended the home of the deceased. They entered the house intending to steal property there from. As he entered the house Richard Smith sustained an injury to his head, which commenced to bleed. Once inside the house the deceased was confronted. Thereafter he was subjected to severe violence. This included the deceased being struck, with fists and weapons, and in such a manner that inter alia he was occasioned a compression injury to the neck. During this time the opening of, or combination to his safe was being demanded, apparently without success. The deceased was also moved about the house, as indicated by a blood trail. After sometime the offender and his companions left the house, leaving the deceased injured on the floor of the premises.

7.   Whilst in the premises the offender and his co offenders ransacked the premises searching for property, including forcing open and attempting to force open safes and other security containers within the house.

8.   In the early hours of the morning of Saturday 20 November the offender returned home and went to bed.

9.   The following day the offender told two women who were living at the same house that he and Richard Smith and Steven Smith had broken into a house in Dangar Street Kempsey. He said that Richard Smith had hit an old man over the head with a hammer and had jumped on the man's head. The offender said he had been in the car when he heard noises. He went into the house and saw Richard Smith hitting the old man over the head with a hammer and jumping on his head. He told the women that he had taken the hammer from Richard Smith and pulled him away and told him to stop. Richard Smith threw the hammer away and the offender threw the shoes he had been wearing away. The offender stated that they got away with nothing because the old man would not disclose the code to the safe and that is why Richard Smith jumped on his head.

10.   At 5.30 pm Saturday 20 November the sister of the deceased, Mary Tarr, attended his residence to share dinner with the deceased. She noticed the morning paper still at the front of the house. Ms Tarr entered the house and found the lounge room ransacked. She called to the deceased and got no response. She left and attended the home of her younger brother, from where the emergency services were contacted. She and her brother met the police outside the premises.

11.   The police entered the premises and found the deceased lying on the floor of a spare bedroom. He was unconscious, covered in blood with severe swelling to his head. The offender was conveyed by ambulance to the Kempsey Hospital, from where he was evacuated by air to the intensive care unit of the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle. Despite the endeavours of the medical staff the deceased failed to respond to treatment. On 26 November 2010 his life support was withdrawn and the deceased passed away that evening.

12.   The police established a crime scene at the home of the deceased.

13.   Detective Senior Constable Gane, from Coffs Harbour Crime Scene Section attended the premises at 9.10 pm on 20 November. Over the next three days he inspected the exterior and interior of 2 Dangar Street.

14.   There were a number of small blood droplets in the hallway, lounge room and kitchen. These blood droplets formed an obvious blood trail. In the kitchen on the floor at the doorway to the hall, the blood spot at Marker 8, was identified as matching the DNA profile of Richard Smith. The other spots all matched the victim.

15.   In bedroom two, which appeared to be spare room, there was a blue plastic sheet covering the bed. In the wardrobe there was a home made safe which had been prized open. The metal box/safe was empty but for a lady's watch and other items of no monetary value. On the floor in front of the wardrobe were two empty wallets and documents.

16.   In the third bedroom, which appeared to be another spare room, the victim had been found lying sandwiched between the double bed and a reinforced double cupboard, a gun locker and two safes housed in shelving. The wardrobe sized maroon cupboard had been badly damaged, with damage to the locks. In an attempt to gain entry to the cupboards, a hardened steel tool had been snapped off inside the timber of the cupboards. Next to these cupboards was the gun safe, which showed attempts to break it open. On the other side of the bed there was a set of drawers and a two drawer filing cabinet both were open with the files and contents disturbed.

17.   The area, in which the victim was located, was covered in blood and there was impact blood spatter on the side of the cupboard which had been smeared and there were visible part shoes (sic) prints amidst the smearing. The blood was identified as belonging to the victim. The shoe prints were identified as coming from Nike TN air max shoes.

18.   There was no evidence of forced entry to the premises however due to some shoe impressions on the floor it was determined that the most likely point of entry and or exit was the rear door of the premises from the kitchen/dining room.

19.   A Post Mortem examination of the victim's body was carried out on 30 November 2010. Doctor Allan Cala determined the cause of death as being craniofacial trauma with both bleeding to the face and within the brain. Each zygoma was fractured. The hyoid bone was fractured suggestive of some form of neck compression or blunt trauma to the upper neck. The victim had lacerations behind his right ear. The overall characteristics of the injuries to the face and head, including the brain, were consistent with a severe, violent and sustained attack to the face, head and neck. The examination of the torso and upper limbs showed injuries consistent with an assault. There were 'patterned' injuries to the back consistent with having being caused by tyre lever, shaft of a golf club or similar,' also bruising to his upper arms and bruising and abrasions to his fingers.

20.   Overall Dr Cala concluded that the injuries to the face and head were consistent with a severe, violent and sustained assault to the face head and neck. The deceased was 75 years old, 177 centimetres in height, weighed 94 kilograms and of medium build.

21.   Following the identification of the presence of the DNA profile of Richard Smith within the blood trail, found within the house of the deceased, the police executed a search warrant on premises at 13 Pipers Creek Road Dondingalong on 8 December 2012. Richard Smith was found hiding in a wardrobe in a bedroom. Four other men were at the house including the offenders Steven Smith and Raymond Kennedy. Richard Smith was arrested in relation to the murder of the deceased.

22.   A partial DNA profile recovered from under the fingernail of the deceased matches the DNA profile of Raymond Kennedy. During the examination of the crime scene Nike TN air Max shoe prints were identified in the back doorway to the kitchen and in blood smears on the cabinet adjacent to where the deceased lay. There is evidence that Raymond Kennedy left to go and meet with the offender and Richard Smith on the night of the offence wearing a pair of Nike shoes.

23.   On 26 February 2011 police installed a listening device into premises 16A Neville Emerson Street. On 5 March 2011 Steven Smith visited the premises and had a conversation which was captured by the listening device. Steven Smith spoke of what happened to the deceased. Amongst other things he said:

He wouldn't give nothing up like he just kicked up. I don't know, we said kick you in the head or something. He just wouldn't buckle we were going to do the safe.

There was money in the safe

The boys had done it before but they just couldn’t get it, like, the safe was fort knox. It wouldn't move. We had fucken anything tried to bust it open just wouldn't bust open you know

24.   Raymond Kennedy was arrested on 2 July 2012. He did not participate in an interview.


	
	To deal with the disputed facts at the sentence hearing, evidence was adduced from Glenda Button, Kirsty Roe and Detective Senior Constable Rutledge. Steven Smith was also called to give evidence but he refused to take an oath or affirmation and refused to answer questions. He threatened Corrective Services Officers and other persons and was eventually removed from the Court. He has been charged with three counts of contempt of court.
	
	
	Kirsty Roe did not appear in answer to a subpoena. Her Honour held, without opposition from the Appellant’s counsel, that she was unavailable for the purposes of s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Her statement was admitted into evidence despite objection from Counsel for the Appellant who submitted that it was not made shortly after the asserted facts occurred, it was unlikely to be reliable, and its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded that, although Ms. Button presented as a reluctant witness who was unwilling to say anything that might be adverse to the Appellant, her Honour was satisfied that when Ms Button gave her statement to the police she gave a truthful account of matters within her knowledge. Her Honour relied on Detective Rutledge for drawing that conclusion and also from the fact that Ms Button could only have known about some of the matters that she referred to in her statement from her own observations or from what the Appellant told her.
	
	
	The significant matter in that regard was that in the late afternoon or early evening of 19 November 2011 the Appellant told family members and others present including Ms Button that he was going out. Referring to Richard Smith, the Appellant told those present that “Poochie” had a “house lined up. There is a safe in it and he wants to do it over”. The Appellant said that someone had told Richard Smith that there were valuable coins kept in a safe at the house. The Appellant left his house intending to meet Richard Smith and Steven Smith. When he left the house he was wearing a pair of borrowed Nike TN jogging shoes.
	
	
	Her Honour also noted that Ms Button recalled the Appellant saying that as they were ""rushing in the door"" at Mr Davies’ house, Richard Smith tripped and cut himself. Her Honour noted that that was consistent with forensic evidence. DNA matching that of Richard Smith was recovered from blood stains at the house.
	
	
	Ms Button saw the Appellant arrive home in the early hours of the morning of 20 November 2010. He went straight to his bedroom without speaking to Ms Button or Ms Roe, who were both awake. Ms Button noticed that he was wearing different clothes from those he had been wearing earlier in the night.
	
	
	The Appellant later told Ms Button about the offence claiming that Richard Smith had hit Mr Davies with a hammer. He said that he had thrown away the Nike shoes he had been wearing. He also said, when Ms Button was present:
	


We got away with nothing, because the bloke wouldn’t give us the code to the safe. That was when Pooch was jumping on him, because he wouldn’t give the code up.


	
	Her Honour noted that biological material removed from under one of Mr Davies’ fingernails matched the DNA profile of the Appellant. Her Honour said that the DNA suggested that Mr Davies may have scratched the Appellant, perhaps defensively but she could not determine that. Her Honour concluded:
	


On all of the evidence, however, I have concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the offender applied force to Mr. Davies during this shameful attack, leading to the deposit of DNA.


	
	Her Honour said that the evidence did not allow her to conclude who of the three offenders inflicted the terrible violence that Mr Davies suffered but it was likely that Richard Smith was responsible for most of the violence.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded on the balance of probabilities that the Appellant was outside the premises for some part of the time during which this crime was carried out. He told Ms Button that he was in the car outside when he heard smashing. On entering, he saw Richard Smith striking Mr Davies with a hammer. The Appellant claimed to have taken the hammer away from Smith but her Honour could not determine even on the balance of probabilities whether that statement had any truth in it.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded at [84]:
	


Whether or not the offender acted as lookout for part of the time, I am satisfied that he entered the house with his two co-offenders, and was a party to the ransacking of Mr. Davies’ house in the hunt for items of value, including by forcefully and repeatedly kicking a locked cupboard in an attempt to gain entry. I am satisfied that he applied force to Mr. Davies, and was present whilst his co-offenders did the same. He, like his co-offenders, did nothing to get aid for Mr. Davies.

Withdrawal of plea

Evidence before the primary judge


	
	At the time of entering his plea, and for some eight or so months prior to that date, the Appellant had been represented by Mr James Trevallion of counsel. Mr Trevallion was instructed by Mr Stephen Wright who had acted for the Appellant since October 2012.
	
	
	Between receiving the brief and the date upon which the Appellant entered his plea of guilty to the charge of murder, Mr Trevallion had held at least six formal conferences with the Appellant, and had spoken with him on other occasions. Mr Wright had had more overall contact with the Appellant since being instructed.
	
	
	Mr Trevallion gave evidence before the primary judge. He said that on reviewing the brief of evidence in about March 2013 he formed the view that the Crown case against the Appellant was reasonably strong but that there was an arguable defence. After some additional evidence was served by the Crown, relating to a shoe print in blood left at the location where the deceased was assaulted, and the recorded conversation involving Steven Smith (paragraph 23 of the Statement of Facts at [13] above), Mr Trevallion saw the Appellant in person on a number of occasions and spoke to him on the telephone to explain the effect of the further evidence.
	
	
	Partly because of the Appellant’s evident difficulty in grasping the concepts of joint criminal enterprise and constructive murder, Mr Trevallion discussed the evidence at length with the Appellant’s brother who in turn discussed it with the Appellant. Mr Trevallion said that the Appellant’s main concern in their discussions about a possible plea of guilty was the likely length of any custodial sentence. At one point the Appellant sought a guarantee from Mr Trevallion as to the length of sentence that would be imposed upon entry of a guilty plea. He was told that no guarantee could be given although it was explained to him that a plea entered before the trial date was likely to attract a greater discount on sentence than one entered on the trial date because of its greater utilitarian value.
	
	
	Mr Trevallion said that in late October 2013 he received a telephone call from the Appellant who told him that he had decided to plead guilty to murder. Mr Trevallion thereupon arranged to see the Appellant at Parklea Prison on 1 November 2013. Written instructions were obtained with a colleague of Mr Trevallion’s being present. Mr Trevallion said that at that conference and when the Appellant instructed him as to the plea of guilty he, Mr Trevallion, had no doubt that the Appellant understood that he was pleading guilty to murder and that he understood the basis of the Crown’s case for murder.
	
	
	Mr Trevallion said that after the pre-sentence report was received the Appellant’s instructions in relation to the plea of guilty were discussed with him and confirmed by him probably on or around 18 December 2013. This was because in the Pre-Sentence Report dated 18 December 2013 it was said that the Appellant disputed the police facts concerning the offending. The Appellant’s then instructions were that he disputed the suggestion that he had known the reason for attending the deceased’s house prior to going there.
	
	
	The matter was then re-listed on 14 February 2014, it seems by the Court, because of the stated dispute about the facts. Barr AJ indicated some concern on his part and on the part of the Crown with what was in that report. Mr Trevallion said this:
	


Your, Honour, myself and my instructing solicitor had a conference with the offender yesterday. I can indicate to the Court that he maintains his plea of guilty. He indicated to us that he agrees, generally agrees with the agreed facts. Specifically there is one point that he does dispute and I have had some discussions with the Crown this morning about this and that is –

…

He disputes that he was aware of the purpose of going to the house on the evening, which is in paragraph 4 – makes up part of the agreed facts in paragraph 4, just that last sentence.

…

HIS HONOUR: You are satisfied that the accused will continue to plead guilty Mr Trevallion?

TREVALLION:    Yes, those are my instructions your Honour.


	
	When the sentence hearing listed for 28 February 2014 was not able to proceed, the Appellant became upset about a number of matters including aspects of the Crown facts. As a result the Appellant was taken through the facts by Mr Wright, indicating those portions with which he disagreed. The disagreement was largely connected with an alleged comment made by the Appellant to Ms Button and Ms Roe to the effect that he had known of a plan to rob the deceased of valuable coins kept in a safe at the deceased’s home prior to attending the premises. Mr Trevallion regarded that dispute as of no significance to the integrity of the plea and continued in his view that the Appellant both wished to plead guilty to murder and understood the basis upon which he acknowledged his liability. Mr Trevallion specifically denied placing any pressure upon the Appellant in relation to the plea.
	
	
	At some time after the entry of the plea, the Appellant told Mr Trevallion that the bloody shoe print found by forensic officers on a cupboard adjacent to the place where the deceased was assaulted was deposited by him in the course of taking a weapon away from a co-offender. The Appellant told Mr Trevallion that he saw Richard Smith striking the deceased with a hammer and took the hammer from Smith. To put the hammer out of the reach of Smith he (the Appellant) took a running jump at a cupboard, using it to gain more momentum to reach the top of the cupboard. He put the hammer on top of the cupboard in that way leaving his shoe print on the cupboard.
	
	
	At an earlier conference with Mr Trevallion the Appellant had attributed the evidence of DNA recovered from the fingernails of the deceased consistent with the Appellant’s, to contact with the deceased who had scratched or grabbed him when he tried to pull Richard Smith away from the deceased to end the assault by Smith on the deceased.
	
	
	Mr Wright gave evidence that he took initial instructions from the Appellant when a public defender rather than private counsel was briefed. Although the Appellant’s initial instructions were consistent with a plea of not guilty, those instructions evolved over time to an acknowledgement of participation in the robbery of the deceased. Initially the Appellant said he had been outside the deceased’s house as lookout for his cousins when they entered the premises, but he had subsequently entered the house and thereafter participated in events. He told Mr Wright that, whilst his co-accused were attempting to extract from the deceased the location of the key to a safe, the Appellant ransacked the house looking for the key and valuables.
	
	
	Mr Wright gave evidence of a different account of two significant pieces of evidence relied upon by the Crown from that which had been provided to Mr Trevallion. In relation to the DNA recovered from the fingernails of the deceased, the Appellant said that he tried to move the deceased, who was prone on the floor after having been assaulted by Richard Smith, into a more comfortable position and the deceased grabbed him. In relation to the bloody shoe print the Appellant told Mr Wright that, when ransacking the house, he was trying to get something from the top of the cupboard and deposited the shoe print on the cupboard in the process.
	
	
	The Appellant maintained to Mr Wright that he had not personally assaulted the deceased. He disputed the account of witnesses that he had acknowledged knowing of the plan to rob the deceased prior to the event as well as the comments made by Steven Smith recorded by the listening device. Mr Wright did not view those issues as relevant to the plea of guilty.
	
	
	The Appellant was assessed by the psychologist Anthony Diment on 27 June 2014. Mr Diment assessed him as having cognitive impairment because his intellectual functioning was in the range below 70. It was assessed at 57. He was also assessed as fitting the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder and substance abuse disorder. The substances were chiefly alcohol and cannabis but also included occasional use of amphetamines.
	
	
	He told Mr Diment that he had agreed with earlier legal advice about his case but had been worried about why he should say guilty to something he had not done. He said that he was adamant that he had not planned the offences but told Mr Diment that his exact memory of what happened
	


…is not great. I had been drinking and when I lay down to think about what happened I do get flashes of bits of it. I do not think I had any idea of hurting anyone. My cousins are not good mates and we never used to hang around much. They just said to come to – I don’t know really. I do think about what happened to the guy and do feel bad about that. That’s it.


	
	The Appellant was also assessed by Dr Susan Pulman, a clinical neuropsychologist, who determined that although his overall level of intellectual functioning fell within the Extremely Low range with his result falling at the first percentile, he was fit to stand trial. Dr Pulman noted that the Appellant’s account of the events accorded with what was contained in his affidavit of 17 June 2014. He told her that he only attended the victim’s premises because he thought they were going to get some drugs there.
	
	
	The Appellant was examined by Dr Olav Nielssen on 16 January 2014. Although he was reluctant to talk to Dr Nielssen about the circumstances of the offending he did say that there was a plan to commit a robbery and that they were meant to go to the premises to get some speed with the money from the robbery. He said that at the time of the offending he was under the influence of alcohol consumed that day and he could not remember exactly how much he had to drink or over what period of time he was drinking. He confirmed that he had entered the plea of guilty to the offence as described in the Summary of Facts which included the results of DNA and footprint evidence, as well as a conversation recorded by a listening device.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen diagnosed him with Substance Abuse Disorder and Substance Induced Psychotic Illness - in remission. Dr Neilssen gave evidence but was entirely reliant on his report because he said that he could not recall interviewing the appellant.
	
	
	At the application for withdrawal of plea the Appellant relied on an affidavit he had sworn on 17 June 2014. In that affidavit he relevantly said:
	


From the very outset of this matter I instructed my legal representative that I was not responsible for the victim’s death though I do admit that I was at the scene of the crime. I only attended the victim’s premises because I thought we were going to get some drugs there.


	
	In his affidavit he also said that initially Mr Wright and Mr Trevallion said that he had a defence and that Mr Wright thought the Crown case was a weak one. He said, however, that they did a complete reversal after they received the evidence of Steven Smith. He said that every time the lawyers came to see him at Parklea from that time on they kept at him about pleading guilty. Although he did plead guilty he was never comfortable with their advice because he said he did not do what was alleged.
	
	
	The Appellant was called to give evidence. He initially answered some questions from his own counsel although not without some difficulty. He denied telling Dr Nielssen that he had gone to the premises for a robbery and did not mention that he was involved in a robbery. He denied telling Mr Wright anything about the bloody shoe print except that he knew nothing about the shoes and that he had never seen them before.
	
	
	What thereafter happened is summarised by the primary judge in R v Raymond Kennedy [2014] NSWSC 1921 in these terms:
	


[19]   Having been able to give this evidence, which was generally consistent with his assertions of innocence, the applicant in cross-examination manifested a complete inability to continue with his testimony. He repeatedly said that he was nervous, didn’t feel right, and would prefer to return at a later date to complete his evidence. He specifically rejected (until later) the proposition that he was ill (T58:31), but maintained that he was nervous and didn’t want to talk about the matter.

[20]   He was not able to give any explanation for the difference between his apparent engagement with the hearing when listening to evidence from the dock, and his inability to recall and discuss relevant events when in the witness box (T64:32).

[21]   Although directed to answer the questions put to him, the applicant continued to give his evidence in an entirely unresponsive way, saying little more than that he didn’t feel right, and couldn’t think properly. The witness was given a short adjournment to compose himself and - with the Crown’s consent - to speak to his lawyers but, on resuming his evidence he generally continued in his refusal to answer in any meaningful way the questions put to him.

[22]   After an extended period of endeavouring to have the applicant answer the questions put to him, and in light of his continuing refusal to answer with anything other than assertions of not feeling right, the applicant was told to leave the witness box. I refused an application for an adjournment made by the applicant’s Counsel at that point, because there was simply no reason to suppose that the applicant would endure the evidentiary process any better on another occasion. All indications were that he would not. It was evident that his refusal to answer questions was not due to any temporary illness from which he would recover or an inability to understand questions phrased in a straightforward way; it was due to a reluctance to answer those questions. Whether that was due to nervousness or as a result of a considered choice, I cannot determine.

Submissions


	
	The Appellant submitted that the primary judge erred in finding that there was no irregularity in which the Appellant entered his pleas of guilty. He submitted that he was a person of limited intellectual functioning and that prior to entering the plea of guilty he consistently disputed involvement in the murder and denied any prior knowledge of a robbery or participation in a robbery.
	
	
	He submitted that the written instructions did not reveal the basis of the plea, and that the plea of guilty was entered without a set of facts being signed by the Appellant or agreed between the parties. He submitted that after entering the plea of guilty he continued to dispute a number of key facts that were inconsistent with being guilty of murder.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted that the evidence of Mr Trevallion in relation to the circumstances of entering the plea of guilty was troubling and irregular. That was because Mr Trevallion said in evidence that there may have been no reason to determine the facts before the plea was entered because the Appellant was not pleading to a lesser offence. The Appellant submitted that the evidence of Mr Trevallion lacked certainty as to the circumstances of liability. Mr Trevallion had described the basis of liability as being part of a joint criminal enterprise but he accepted that the Appellant always maintained that he did not strike nor did he kill the deceased. The Appellant had consistently denied any prior knowledge of an intention on the part of the co-accused to commit a robbery.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted that the evidence of Mr Trevallion lacked certainty as to whether he was given specific instruction on the critical issue of liability. There was no express agreement as to the underlying facts and liability. It was submitted that there was a failure to resolve the basis of liability at the time of entering the plea particularly as the Appellant had told Dr Pulman that he was not guilty of murder and was not prepared to plead guilty to something he did not do.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted that the primary judge erred by finding that the evidence established that the Appellant instructed Mr Wright that he became involved in the robbery of the deceased at a time when he knew that the deceased was being viciously attacked and seriously injured to persuade him to part with his property. No written admission of this was obtained by Mr Wright.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted that the primary judge erred by finding that support for the fact that the plea was a voluntary acknowledgment of guilt could be found in the report of Dr Nielssen where the Appellant told Dr Nielssen that he had gone to the deceased’s house to rob the deceased. The submission was made particularly in the context that Dr Nielssen said that he had no memory of interviewing the Appellant.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted that the primary judge erred in finding that the Appellant understood his liability for murder particularly given the intellectual circumstances of the Appellant as appeared from the reports of Dr Pulman and Mr Diment.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted that there was a real risk of a miscarriage of justice. The Appellant demonstrated a strongly triable issue. He consistently disputed involvement in the murder and denied knowledge of the robbery or participation in the assault of the deceased. He consistently disputed the evidence of the co-offender Steven Smith as well as that of Ms Button and Ms Roe. In circumstances where Mr Smith refused to give evidence, Ms Roe failed to attend Court and Ms Button denied any memory of the alleged admissions by the Appellant the evidence was questionable and may not have supported a conviction for the offence charged.
	


Consideration


	
	The relevant principles in relation to an appeal from a plea of guilty where it is sought to withdraw the plea are set out in R v Van [2002] NSWCCA 148; 129 A Crim R 229 by Greg James J (with whom Hodgson JA and Kirby J agreed):
	


[48]   What is necessary to be shown before an appeal might be successful from a conviction entered up as a consequence of a plea of guilty, has been variously expressed. See Regina v. Boag (1994) 73 A. Crim. R. 35; Regina v. Meissner (1995) 184 CLR 132; Regina v. Maxwell (1995) 184 CLR 501; Regina v. Ross (NSWCCA, unreported 20 February 1994); Regina Liberti (1991) 55 A. Crim. R. 120 and the cases referred to by Spigelman, CJ. in Regina v. Houra [2001] NSWCCA 61 at paras.32-33. The principles have been conveniently summarised in the applicant's submissions taken from Houra (supra) as follows:-

""• Where the appellant 'did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered' ( Regina v. Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A. Crim. R. 231 at 233).

• Where the plea was not 'a free and voluntary confession' ( Regina v. Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218 at 220 D-E).

• The 'plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt' ( Regina v. Murphy [1965] VR 187 at 191).

• Where there was 'mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt' ( Regina v. Sagiv (1986) 22 A. Crim. R. 73 at 80).

• Where the 'plea was induced by threats or other impropriety when the appellant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty … some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt' ( Regina v. Concotta (NSWCCA, 1 November 1995, unreported)).

• The 'plea of guilty must either be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt' ( Maxwell v. The Queen (supra) at 511).

• If 'the person who entered the plea was not in possession of all of the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt' ( Regina v. Davies (NSWCCA, 16 December 1993, unreported)). See also Regina v. Ganderton (NSWCCA, 17 September 1998, unreported) and Regina v. Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320.""

[49]   To the cases cited should be added reference to Regina v. Iral [1999] NSWCCA 368 in which the failure of the appellant to appreciate the nature of the charge and difficulties with an interpreter lead (sic) to the appeal being upheld; Regina v. Wilkes [2001] NSWCCA 97 where the advice of trial counsel to enter the plea was held to be imprudent and inappropriate thus occasioning a miscarriage of justice; Regina v. McLean [2001] NSWCCA 58 in which senior counsel's inappropriate advice on the applicant's ability to challenge a relevant matter of fact occasioned a miscarriage of injustice; Regina v. KCH [2001] NSWCCA 273 involving improper pressure by counsel and Regina v. Becheru (CCA, unreported 6 April 2001) and Regina v. Toro-Martinez (2000) 114 A. Crim. R. 533.

[50]   In Liberti (supra) at 122, Kirby, P. referred to the court's approach to a proposed change of plea or to an asserted want of understanding of what was involved in a plea of guilty as with ""caution bordering on circumspection"", since such a plea in law is an admission of all the legal ingredients of the offence and is the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made: see Lee, J. in Sagiv (supra). In Meissner (supra) Brennan, Toohey and McHugh, JJ. at 141 said:-

""A court will act on a plea of guilty when it is entered in open court by a person who is of full age and apparently of sound mind and understanding, provided the plea is entered in the exercise of a free choice in the interests of the person entering the plea. There is no miscarriage of justice if the court does act on such a plea, even if the person entering it is not indeed guilty of the offence.""


	
	In Ming Yuk (Raymond) Wong v The Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] NSWSC 129; (2005) 155 A Crim R 37 Howie J said:
	


[33]   A court is entitled to accept a plea of guilty that is given in the exercise of a free choice in a defendant’s own interests and there will be no miscarriage resulting from reliance on the plea even though the person entering the plea “is not in truth guilty of the offence”: Meissner [R v Meissner (1995) 184 CLR 132] at 141. Justice Dawson stated the following at 157 (footnotes omitted):

It is true that a person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person's belief in his guilt. He may do so for all manner of reasons: for example, to avoid worry, inconvenience or expense; to avoid publicity; to protect his family or friends; or in the hope of obtaining a more lenient sentence than he would if convicted after a plea of not guilty. The entry of a plea of guilty upon grounds such as these nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. Ordinarily that will only be where the accused did not understand the nature of the charge or did not intend to admit he was guilty of it or if upon the facts admitted by the plea he could not in law have been guilty of the offence. But the accused may show that a miscarriage of justice occurred in other ways and so be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty and have his conviction set aside. For example, he may show that his plea was induced by intimidation of one kind or another, or by an improper inducement or by fraud.

…

[36]   If, on the other hand, the advice was concerned with whether he should plead guilty despite his denial of the offence in order, for example, to obtain some advantage for himself then the focus of the proceedings might be different. Simply because a defendant is induced to plead guilty because of legal advice given to him, it does not follow that he should be allowed to withdraw the plea of guilty even if others might disagree with the advice. This is because there will be no miscarriage of justice arising. The issue in such a case might focus on whether the plea of guilty was entered in the exercise of a free choice in the defendant’s own interests. Of course the fact that a person is induced into taking a course of action does not mean the person in acting on that inducement is not acting from a free choice. It is not every threat, inducement or pressure applied to a defendant that either requires or justifies a court in permitting the defendant to withdraw a plea of guilty: Sewell above at [34].

[37]   But if the plaintiff by taking the advice proffered to him, entered the plea of guilty as a result of the exercise of a free choice in what he believed to be his best interests at the time, and if, when he entered the plea, he understood that he was admitting his guilt of the offence to the court, it does not follow that a miscarriage of justice would arise by refusing the application simply because he maintains his innocence of the charge and has always done so, or because he now regrets taking the advice. As Dawson J stated in Meissner in the passage quoted above, a miscarriage of justice will normally only arise in that situation where the defendant did not understand the nature of the charge or did not intend by his plea to admit his guilt of it.


	
	In commenting on these two cases Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom McCallum and Garling JJ agreed) said in Khamis v R [2014] NSWCCA 152 at [59]:
	


What emerges from those statements of principle is that any miscarriage of justice is to be found in the circumstances in which the applicant came to enter his plea. Ordinarily, this task is not an investigation of the applicant's guilt or innocence, rather it is an examination of the integrity of the plea of guilty itself (R v Stephen J Ray (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 380 at [20]; Sabapathy v R [2008] NSWCCA 82). The onus lies upon the applicant to demonstrate that leave should be granted.


	
	In Rotner v R [2011] NSWCCA 207 Simpson J (as her Honour then was) (McClellan CJ at CL at Fullerton J agreeing) said at [49]:
	


There are, in fact, two components to the test so stated - first, some circumstance that permits a conclusion that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt, and, second, an ""issuable"" question about the guilt of the applicant. Neither, alone, is sufficient. As I understand the test, it is necessary for the applicant to point to circumstances that created a doubt about his guilt, as well as circumstances that raise a doubt about his own perception, at the time he entered the plea, of his guilt.


	
	One of the significant difficulties faced by the Appellant is the findings of fact made by the primary judge. When confronted with this problem at the outset of his submissions counsel for the Appellant sought to add ground 2 to the conviction appeal and submitted that the Appellant did not need to demonstrate a specific error in her Honour’s approach to succeed on the application. The basis for that submission appears to have been that if the Appellant could demonstrate a miscarriage of justice specific error would not be necessary.
	
	
	However, in coming to a view about whether there has been a miscarriage of justice by the guilty plea this Court must do so on the basis of factual findings made by the primary judge. In R v O’Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397 Hunt J said (at 401):
	


It is important to emphasise that, unlike appeals to the Court of Appeal in civil cases, an appeal to this Court is not by way of rehearing. An appeal which is not by way of rehearing is no more than the right to have a superior court interpose to redress the error of the court below: AG v Sillem (1864) 10 HLC 704 at 724 [11 ER 1200 at 1209]; Vic Stevedoring & General Contracting Co Pty Ltd v Dignan (1931) 46 CLR 73 at 109. Error may be demonstrated if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way, or if the judge has misdirected himself. But this Court has no power to substitute its own findings for those of the trial judge. The members of this Court may individually disagree with the findings which were made, but the Court cannot for that reason interfere with those findings. It is only where the very narrow basis upon which this Court can intervene in relation to a trial judge's findings of fact has been established that the conviction can be set aside, and then only if the error has led to a miscarriage of justice.


	
	In that regard her Honour accepted Mr Trevallion and Mr Wright as honest witnesses with a clear memory of relevant events. Her Honour held that their evidence contradicted the Appellant’s evidence in some material respects and that those differences cast doubt on the Appellant’s reliability. In any event, her Honour did not accept the Appellant as a reliable witness or “necessarily an honest one”.
	
	
	Her Honour did not accept that the Appellant was subjected to any pressure by his lawyers, improper or otherwise. Despite the attacks on Dr Nielssen’s reliability in cross-examination it is apparent that her Honour accepted his evidence contained in his report. She held that that evidence was corroborative of what the lawyers said that the Appellant told them about the circumstances of the offending.
	
	
	As the Crown submitted, it is necessary for the Appellant to satisfy both of the matters referred to in Rotner. The Appellant’s submissions tended to concentrate only on the circumstances said to raise doubt about his own perceptions at the time of entering into the plea, that is to say, that the plea was not attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt. Any attention to the matter of whether there was an issue about the Appellant’s guilt seemed to require a re-consideration of all of the evidence without regard to the primary judge’s factual findings.
	
	
	However, an examination of the evidence which was accepted by the primary judge shows that the Appellant fails to demonstrate either of the matters that Rotner requires to be demonstrated.
	
	
	The concerns identified about Mr Trevallion’s evidence were directed to the Appellant’s understanding of the plea. The emphasis on the lack of agreement to a set of facts seems to me to be misplaced. The evidence in Mr Trevallion’s possession from an early time prima facie demonstrated a joint criminal enterprise involving the Appellant to rob the deceased. The statements of Ms Button and Ms Roe provided that evidence. The Appellant’s DNA was found under the deceased’s fingernail. The Appellant accepted that he was present during some of the time the robbery was occurring and the deceased was being assaulted. Subsequently Mr Trevallion received the evidence relating to the bloody shoeprint and became aware that Steven Smith would be called by the Crown to give evidence of what occurred.
	
	
	That was the basis on which Mr Trevallion explained to the Appellant the legal concepts of joint criminal enterprise and felony-murder. There was quite sufficient in that evidence, even before the final preparation of any set of facts, upon which a plea could properly be advised and made. The fact that the Appellant always maintained that he did not assault the deceased did not weaken the legal basis for his liability for the offence charged. Mr Trevallion’s evidence made clear that the basis of the plea was that the Appellant had become involved in the robbery before or at the time of its occurrence.
	
	
	Mr Trevallion’s evidence must be seen also in the light of Mr Wright’s evidence that on 13 February 2013 the Appellant gave Mr Wright a version of events that had him as a participant and not a spectator. After the further evidence of the bloody shoeprint was served Mr Wright said that in October 2013 the Appellant admitted to ransacking the house while the deceased was being assaulted. It was in that context that the Appellant told Mr Wright the version of the footprint being planted on the cupboard when he was trying to retrieve something from the top of the cupboard.
	
	
	If it were necessary for this Court to consider the reliability of Mr Trevallion’s evidence, what the Appellant said to Dr Neilssen as reported by him, and what Mr Wright said would assist in reaching a conclusion that it could confidently rely on Mr Trevallion’s evidence. There is no error of law in the findings made by the primary judge because there is evidence to support the findings.
	
	
	Although the Appellant had difficulty grasping the concepts of felony-murder and joint criminal enterprise, Mr Trevallion’s evidence was that the Appellant was receptive to his advice in respect of his prospects of success. Mr Trevallion’s evidence was that the Appellant’s brother was involved in discussions with the Appellant and that his brother seemed to have a reasonably good understanding of the Crown case and the Appellant’s prospects of success. The advice on prospects of success was also in the context of the Appellant’s concern about the likely length of the custodial sentence if he pleaded guilty. Nothing has been shown to cast doubt on that aspect of Mr Trevallion’s evidence. He said that the Appellant appeared to understand the plea and the basis of it, being his involvement in the robbery which resulted in the deceased’s death.
	
	
	Although the Appellant wanted to suggest that he had been pressured by the lawyers, not only was his evidence regarded as unreliable by the primary judge but Mr Trevallion’s unchallenged evidence was that the process was set in train by a phone call made by the Appellant to Mr Trevallion saying that he wished to plead guilty. That led to Mr Trevallion going out to the prison with another person to obtain the written instructions from him. The matter of pressure by the lawyers on the Appellant scarcely made an appearance at the appeal.
	
	
	Acceptance of Mr Trevallion’s evidence entirely justifies the conclusion of the primary judge that the plea of guilty arose from a consciousness of guilt on the part of the Appellant and also from his concern to obtain the best discount on a custodial sentence because of an early plea. As Dawson J said in R v Meissner (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 157 a person may plead guilty on grounds which extend beyond the person’s belief in his guilt and the person may do so for all manner of reasons. One of those reasons is the hope of obtaining a more lenient sentence than if he contested the matter. Justice Dawson said that the entry of a plea of guilty for that reason constitutes an admission of all of the elements of the offence and it will not be set aside unless a miscarriage of justice is demonstrated.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted that there was a real risk of a miscarriage of justice. He submitted that he had demonstrated a strong triable issue. He said that he had consistently disputed involvement in the murder and denied knowledge of the robbery and had not participated in the assault of the deceased.
	
	
	No miscarriage of justice is demonstrated. The plea was made and confirmed with full knowledge of essential factual matters after explanation of the legal concepts. It was voluntary and attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt and by reason of the benefit of a discount on the sentence for an early plea in the circumstances of the strength of the Crown case.
	
	
	There would only be a strong triable issue if it were true that he had always disputed his involvement in the robbery and if there were no other evidence pointing to that involvement. The evidence discussed above shows that he has not always disputed his involvement in the robbery. There is other evidence of his intended involvement in the robbery and of his participation in it.
	
	
	It may be accepted that the Appellant was not responsible for participating in the assault on the deceased nor killing him in any direct sense. It is not the case, however, that he has consistently disputed knowledge of the robbery for the reasons already given. His involvement in the joint criminal enterprise to rob the deceased produces the result that he is liable to be found guilty for the murder of the deceased although it was actually carried out by one of the co-offenders. The evidence pointed to application of extended common purpose by the Appellant’s continued involvement in the robbery at a time when grievous bodily harm had been and was being inflicted on the deceased by one or more of the co-offenders: McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108. Simply because he may not have fully understood the law concerning joint criminal enterprise and felony murder cannot provide a basis for impugning the integrity of the plea.
	
	
	The appeal against the refusal to permit the withdrawal of the plea should be rejected.
	


Sentence

Grounds 1 and 2 – the Appellant’s knowledge of an intended robbery


	
	These grounds are dealt with together in the Appellant’s submissions. They concern findings that the Appellant knew that a robbery at the deceased’s house was intended.
	
	
	In her Remarks on Sentence the primary judge said this:
	


[56]   During the late afternoon or early evening of 19 November 2011 the offender told family members and others present, including Glenda Button, that he was going out. Referring to Richard Smith, the offender told those present that “Poochie” had a “house lined up. There is a safe in it and he wants to do it over”. The offender said that someone had told Richard Smith, or “Poochie” as he was known, that there were valuable coins kept in a safe at the house. The offender left his home intending to meet Richard Smith and Steven Smith.


	
	The Appellant submitted that the evidence relied upon by her Honour from Ms Button and Ms Roe was unreliable and could not form the basis of a factual finding beyond reasonable doubt. The Appellant pointed to the evidence given by Ms Button that her statement to the police was made at a time when she was drug affected and that some parts of it were not true.
	
	
	The Appellant drew attention to the fact that Ms Roe failed to attend Court during the sentence proceedings despite the issue of a subpoena for her attendance, and to the fact that her statement was admitted over objection on the basis that she was a witness unavailable under s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). It was not submitted that the primary judge erred in having determined that Ms Roe was an unavailable witness.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted that there was no independent forensic evidence suggesting that he had prior knowledge of a robbery or a plan to “do a safe”. The Appellant submitted that there was no independent forensic evidence of the disputed conversations with Ms Roe and accordingly her evidence should not have been accepted.
	
	
	In her statement of 17 December 2010 Ms Button said this:
	


11.   … I also remember Raymond saying, “Poochie’s got a house lined up. There is a safe it, and he wants to do it over.” He also said words to the effect of, “A mate told Poochie that there was valuable coins in the safe”. Everyone was there when he said this.

…

20.   At this time [when the Appellant returned home the following night] Raymond said, “Me, Pooch and Steven done a break and enter on the bloke up there. Pooch was hitting him in the head. He was jumping off the bed onto his head and stomach. I was in the car, and heard all the smashing. I went into the house to see what was going on. I grabbed him to stop him. I took the hammer off him. Steven was still in the lounge room looking for money and coins. Then we left. I threw my shoes away in the grass. Pooch got rid of the hammer. That’s when I come home.” Richard said, “Well you and me are going to see Pooch tomorrow, to make sure Pooch takes the rap.” Raymond said, “When we were doing break ins, Pooch said that he would take the rap if he ever got caught.”


	
	In her statement of 17 December 2010 Kirsty Roe said this:
	


10.   I remember that early in the night, Raymond left the house and his car, … he told us that he was going to go out to Lully’s place as he was going to meet up with Poochie and Steven, to have a drink with them. I remember, “Poochie’s got a house lined up. He wants to do it over.” He also said, “A mate told Poochie that there was valuable coins there.” Kack, Chock, Lizzie, Mark, and Richard were all there when he said it.

…

17.   Then Raymond said, “Me, Pooch and Steven done that house over. I heard Poochie inside smashing it around. Steven and I walked in. We’ve seen Poochie jumping on his head and stomach. Poochie was smashing him in the head with the hammer. I grabbed the hammer off him and made him stop. I pulled him away. I told him to stop.” Chock and Kack said, “Your first priority is the baby and Lizzie. Give it up.” Raymond said, “Pooch tripped and cut himself. The coppers will get him on DNA. We got away with nothing, because the bloke wouldn’t give us the code to the safe.”


	
	Ms Button gave evidence and was cross-examined by both the Crown and counsel for the Appellant on her statement. In answer to the Crown, who took her through the statement page by page, she said that everything was true except paragraphs 25 and 26. She did say, however, that she was under the influence of drugs at the time she signed the statement but, except for those two paragraphs, it was all true. When cross-examined by counsel for the Appellant she claimed not to remember what paragraph 11 recorded as having been said to her by the Appellant. She said the same thing about paragraph 20.
	
	
	Detective Senior Constable Dean Rutledge gave evidence that he was the officer responsible for taking the statements from Ms Button and Ms Roe. He knew both of them and he knew that they were users of heroin and, in Ms Roe’s case, cannabis also. He said that neither of them appeared to be under the influence of any drugs when they made their statements. He said that he would have gone through the statements with each of them before they signed them. He said that no pressure was put on them and he did not suggest the information to them which is contained in their statements.
	
	
	The primary judge had regard to all of these matters and concluded:
	


[33]   Whilst Ms. Button presented as a reluctant witness who was unwilling to say anything that might be adverse to the offender, I am satisfied that, when she gave her statement, she gave a truthful account of matters within her knowledge. I have had regard to the evidence of Detective Rutledge in drawing that conclusion, but also to the fact that Ms. Button could only have known about some of those matters that she referred to in her statement from her own observations or from what the offender told her. That conclusion is strengthened to a degree by the correspondence between those matters connected with the home invasion that she referred to, and other independent evidence (such as medical and forensic evidence) of those same things. The fact that Kirsty Roe gave a consistent account in her statement, albeit untested, also provides some further reason to accept as truthful those things Ms. Button said in her statement, and affirmed in most regards in her evidence.

[34]   Although Ms. Roe’s statement of 17 December 2010 was unsworn, and not subject to testing, I have had regard to its contents insofar as those contents are supported by evidence independent of Ms. Roe (and of Ms. Button). I do so on the basis that Ms. Roe made her statement willingly and at such a time when she was not drug affected, and she acknowledged within it the obligation on her to tell the truth. Where her statement is consistent with forensic evidence, it may be accepted beyond reasonable doubt.


	
	Whether or not this evidence ought to have been accepted and what weight should be given to it was a matter for the primary judge. The Appellant does not demonstrate that her Honour made any error in the assessment of Ms Button’s evidence or the receipt of Ms Roe’s evidence. No appeal was brought against the admission of Ms Roe’s evidence, only a complaint that it should not have been relied on. That was a matter for the primary judge: O’Donoghue at 401 (see [60] above).
	
	
	It is not at all surprising that her Honour made the factual findings that she did. She had before her the report from Dr Nielssen which recorded the Appellant telling Dr Nielssen that there was a plan to commit a robbery. Further, counsel for the Appellant at the hearing of the appeal made reference to the evidence of Mr Wright and Mr Trevallion to point to the fact that there was a history by the Appellant of disputing what was claimed by Ms Button and Ms Roe. If regard is to be had to Mr Trevallion’s and Mr Wright’s evidence, that evidence tends to provide further support for Ms Button’s statement that the Appellant knew that a robbery was planned. The relevant evidence was discussed at [36] and [66] above when dealing with the appeal against the refusal to allow the plea to be withdrawn.
	
	
	We would reject these grounds of appeal.
	


Ground 3:   Whether the Appellant applied force to the deceased


	
	Her Honour found that the Appellant applied force to the deceased as follows:
	


[81]   Biological material removed from under one of Mr. Davies’ fingernails matches the DNA profile of the offender. It is clear there was physical contact between the two. That the DNA was recovered from underneath the fingernail suggests that Mr. Davies may have scratched the offender, perhaps defensively. That I cannot determine. On all of the evidence, however, I have concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the offender applied force to Mr. Davies during this shameful attack, leading to the deposit of DNA.

…

[84]   Whether or not the offender acted as lookout for part of the time, I am satisfied that he entered the house with his two co-offenders, and was a party to the ransacking of Mr. Davies’ house in the hunt for items of value, including by forcefully and repeatedly kicking a locked cupboard in an attempt to gain entry. I am satisfied that he applied force to Mr. Davies, and was present whilst his co-offenders did the same. He, like his co-offenders, did nothing to get aid for Mr. Davies.


	
	The Appellant submits that there was no evidence that could have justified such findings. The only evidence suggesting physical contact between the Appellant and the deceased was DNA of the Appellant recovered from underneath a fingernail of the deceased. The Appellant had always denied striking the deceased and there was no other evidence, including in the statements of Ms Button and Ms Roe, to the contrary. The only possible source for those findings was in the listening device evidence concerning Steven Smith.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was a matter for her Honour to determine the weight to be placed on the Appellant’s denials of having touched the deceased other than to move him to a more comfortable position. The Crown submitted that it is clear that her Honour did not rely on the listening device evidence. The Crown submitted that her Honour was entitled to infer that the Appellant had used force towards the deceased by the evidence concerning the disposal of shoes and clothes, referred to in the statements of Ms Button and Ms Roe.
	
	
	In our opinion, there was no evidence which could support the findings made by the primary judge that the Appellant applied force to the deceased. Whatever doubt there may be about other matters concerning the Appellant’s involvement, the Appellant has consistently maintained that he never struck or assaulted the deceased. The disposal of shoes and clothing is consistent with an attempt to distance himself from the events without saying anything about the extent of his involvement including the application of physical violence. The DNA found under the deceased’s fingernail is entirely equivocal on the issue of whether the Appellant applied force towards the deceased. Whilst the Appellant may not have assisted matters by giving a different account of how his DNA came to be found under the deceased’s fingernail to Mr Trevallion on the one hand and to Mr Wright on the other, that inconsistency and his other denials do not lead to a conclusion that he did apply force to the deceased. That is the more so when the finding is required to be made beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	We would uphold this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 4:   Sentence manifestly excessive


	
	In the light of error having been found in relation to ground 3 it is not strictly necessary for the Court to consider this ground of appeal. However, because the Court must engage in a fresh sentencing exercise it is necessary to consider whether any lesser sentence is warranted: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted that he had a powerful subjective case because he came from a deprived and dysfunctional family background. At an early age he had been exposed to adults around him using illicit drugs. He experienced the trauma of family members being killed in a house fire and the family needing to move constantly. He was schooled in a haphazard manner and is illiterate. He has low intellectual and cognitive functioning.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted further that he has a justifiable sense of grievance about the sentence he received in comparison to sentences handed down to Richard Smith and Steven Smith. We note in that regard that there was no appeal ground concerning parity, but the sentences imposed on the co-offenders must be considered in the re-sentencing exercise.
	
	
	Richard Smith was sentenced by Schmidt J on 23 August 2013. He received a discount of 18 per cent for his plea. The starting point for the sentence was 28 years imprisonment. With the discount her Honour sentenced him to a term of 22 years and 11 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 17 years and two months.
	
	
	Steven Smith was sentenced on 14 November 2013 by Barr AJ and for two offences of armed robbery unrelated to the killing of the deceased. He was sentenced on the basis that he did not assault the deceased. He received a discount for a late plea of ten per cent. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 20 years with a non-parole period of 14 years for the murder of the deceased. The sentence was made partly concurrent with the sentences imposed for the robberies. The starting point for the murder sentence was 22 years and three months imprisonment.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that even if error was found in relation to ground 3 no lesser sentence was warranted. The Appellant submitted that if the finding that he struck the deceased was incorrect his moral culpability in relation to the offending was less. That would reflect itself in the instinctive synthesis involved in the sentence.
	
	
	The primary judge’s factual findings in relation to the Appellant’s subjective circumstances (paragraphs [110]-[133]) should be accepted. The background and deprivations of the Appellant did not substantially differ from those of the co-offenders. The Appellant was seven to eight years younger than the co-offenders and was aged 18 and a half at the time of the offending.
	
	
	The objective seriousness of the offence was above the mid-range for the reasons given by the primary judge. However, the Appellant’s culpability should be regarded as lower than the co-offender who assaulted the deceased because his liability depends on the doctrine of extended common purpose: Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609; R v Penisini; R v Lagi; R v Taufahema [2003] NSWSC 892 at [124]-[127].
	
	
	The plea was a late one and it left a significant factual dispute that needed to be resolved at the sentence proceedings. In the circumstances a discount of five per cent should be allowed.
	
	
	Except for two matters we would have considered that no lesser sentence was warranted for the Appellant. He was a party to an enterprise involving the invasion of the deceased’s home with a view to robbery to purchase drugs and then a party to a prolonged and vicious assault on the deceased resulting in his death some days later. The first matter is that the primary judge’s notional starting point was 22 years in circumstances where she considered that the Appellant had applied force to the deceased. The second matter is that Barr AJ’s notional starting point for the sentence imposed on Steven Smith was 22 years and 3 months where Barr AJ sentenced him on the basis that he did not physically assault the deceased.
	
	
	In those circumstances, with a notional starting point of 21 years we would sentence the Appellant to a non-parole period of 15 years with an additional term of 5 years. The length of the time on parole pursuant to the statutory ratio does not justify the finding of special circumstances.
	


Conclusion


	
	We propose the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal against conviction dismissed.
	
	
	Leave to withdraw plea of guilty refused.
	
	
	Grant leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed by Wilson J on 27 March 2015.
	
	
	In lieu, sentence the Appellant to a non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment commencing 2 July 2012 and expiring 1 July 2027 with a balance of term of 5 years expiring 1 July 2032.

2428223,Duncan v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2016] NSWCA 143,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

In February 2011 the Independent Commission Against Corruption (“ICAC”) commenced an investigation into the circumstances in which the NSW State government had come to issue a coal exploration licence to Cascade Coal (“Cascade”) over an area in the Bylong Valley, known as the Mount Penny tenement, in October 2009. A significant proportion of the land within the tenement was owned by interests associated with the Hon Edward Obeid MLC and members of the family, the market value of which increased fourfold as a result of the grant of the exploration licence. A connection was noted between Edward Obeid and the Hon Ian Macdonald MLC, then Minister for Primary Industries and for Mineral Resources, responsible for granting the exploration licence. The Commission conducted a public inquiry during 2012-2013 culminating in a report (Investigation into the conduct of Ian Macdonald, Edward Obeid Snr, Moses Obeid and Others, July 2013), in which it made findings of corrupt conduct against various individuals under the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW) (“ICAC Act”). The Commission relevantly found that Cascade had entered into a joint venture agreement with an Obeid-controlled company with respect to the award of the Mount Penny exploration licence. In a related inquiry culminating in a third report (Operations Jasper and Acacia – Addressing Outstanding Questions, December 2013), the Commission considered the fate of exploration licences granted over three identified tenements (Mount Penny, Glendon Brook and Doyle’s Creek), recommending that the licences be expunged by legislation.

The Commission made findings of corrupt conduct on the part of the appellants with respect to the steps they had taken towards a proposed sale of their shares in Cascade to a public company, White Energy Co Ltd (“White Energy”). The Commission found that prior to the proposed sale the appellants had taken steps to remove the Obeid family involvement from the joint venture which was seen to pose a potential risk to the value of the Mount Penny tenement: the risk being that the exploration licence might be cancelled by the government, and that a mining lease might never be granted should the Obeids’ involvement become known. The appellants were all shareholders (indirectly) and directors of Cascade; and all (apart from Mr Poole) were directors of White Energy. As the proposal involved White Energy purchasing a major asset from its own directors, the Australian Stock Exchange was notified and an Independent Board Committee (“IBC”) set up to assess the proposal on behalf of White Energy and its shareholders.

The Commission made findings of corrupt conduct on the part of the appellants, based on their failure to reveal information to the IBC, and their involvement in actions which the Commission found were intended to deceive relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in the Mount Penny tenement. The Commission found that this amounted to:

1.   deliberately misleading the IBC chair as to the Obeid family involvement in the Mount Penny tenement by failing to disclose the involvement when the issue was raised [Duncan];

2.   deliberately failing to disclose to the IBC the fact of the Obeid family involvement despite knowing that it was concerned with any such involvement [Duncan; McGuigan, Atkinson, Poole];

3.   telling the IBC that he was not aware of any payments having been made to Edward Obeid Snr or any entities involved with him [Poole];

4.   relieving the Director of Corporate Finance at Mr Poole’s company, from having to answer the IBC chair’s request for information about the Obeid family involvement [Duncan, McGuigan];

5.   authorising Mr Poole to arrange for the Obeids to be extracted from Mount Penny joint venture through arrangements involving Coal & Minerals Group and Southeast Investments [Duncan, McGuigan, Atkinson, Poole].

In January 2014, Messrs Travers Duncan, John McGuigan, Richard Poole, John Atkinson and John Kinghorn, commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court challenging the Commission’s findings of corrupt conduct against them by way of judicial review. The companies challenged the recommendation that the exploration licences be expunged. In a judgment handed down on 29 July 2014 McDougall J: (i) dismissed the finding of corrupt conduct under the ICAC Act against Mr Kinghorn as not made according to law; (ii) upheld the findings of the Commission against the other four individual applicants, whilst rejecting aspects of the Commission’s reasoning; and (iii) dismissed the proceedings brought by the companies (Cascade Coal Ltd and subsidiaries). Messrs Duncan, McGuigan, Poole and Atkinson and the companies sought and were granted leave to appeal to this Court. The Commission submitted a notice of contention concerning the primary judge’s rejection of the Commission’s findings by the applicants as directors of White Energy, under s 184(1) Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).

The issues to be determined on appeal were:

(i)   whether the conduct, the subject of the Commission’s findings, could adversely affect the particular exercises of public functions, and so constitute “corrupt conduct” under s 8(2) ICAC Act;

(ii)   whether the conduct, the subject of the Commission’s findings, was capable of constituting criminal offences for the purposes of s 9(1)(a) ICAC Act; specifically,

(a)   whether the appellants (other than Mr Poole) could be found to have violated their duties as company directors, in contravention of s 184(1) of the Corporations Act, in satisfaction of s 8(2)(s) ICAC Act; and

(b)   whether the findings of fact made by the Commission supported the offence of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception, as identified in s 192E(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), in satisfaction of s 8(2)(e) ICAC Act;

(iii)   whether the appellants were afforded procedural fairness, in circumstances in which the offences and their particular elements relied on by the Commission were not averted to until closing submissions by counsel assisting the Commission, consequently denying the appellants the opportunity to be questioned or to give evidence as to the elements of those offences;

(iv)   whether the Commission had the jurisdiction to recommend that the company exploration licences be expunged and whether such recommendations were amenable to judicial review.

The Court held, Bathurst CJ (dissenting as to Messrs Atkinson, Poole, and Glendon Brook), Beazley P and Basten JA:.

In relation to (i)

1.   “Corrupt conduct” is any conduct which falls within ss 8(1) or (2), and which is not excluded by s 9, ICAC Act: [155]-[165]; [466]-[467]; [585]-[598].

2.   The relevant interpretation of “corrupt conduct” pursuant to s 8(2) ICAC Act for these proceedings was not limited by the construction accepted in Independent Commission Against Corruption v Cunneen [2015] HCA 14; 89 ALJR 475, because of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Amendment (Validation) Act 2015 (NSW): [22]-[23]; [460]; [590].

3.   The Commission was required to identify a relevant government function in determining whether the appellants’ subject conduct “could adversely affect” the exercise of its function, pursuant to s 8(2) ICAC Act, which was accordingly limited to the body responsible for determining the future granting of a mining lease: [194]; [460]; [613]-[614].

4.   Ministerial discretion in approving a mining lease is only limited by the scope and purpose of the relevant statutory context. Relevant considerations included the public interest. The relevant public interest should not be narrowly construed, and is not limited to environmental considerations, thereby including the conduct subject of the Commission’s findings, Mining Act 1992 (NSW), s 63(2) (now repealed); Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW), Part 3A (now repealed); Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2000 (NSW), cl 8B(b): [230]-[233]; [460]; [662]-[679].

Minister for Planning v Walker [2008] NSWCA 224; 161 LGERA 423; The Pilbara Infrastructure Pty Ltd v Australian Competition Tribunal (2012) 246 CLR 379 considered.

5.   Whether relevant information is already in the public domain, or whether the information in the public domain would inevitably lead to further disclosure of the subject information, does not preclude a finding that the information sought to be concealed satisfies the test of adverse effect postulated by s 8(2) ICAC Act: [303]-[305]; [460]; [682].

In relation to (ii) 

6.   Sections 8(2), 9(1)(a) and 13(3A) ICAC Act do not require the Commission to be satisfied that a criminal offence has in fact been committed in order to justify a finding of corrupt conduct. Rather, the Commission must be satisfied that the facts found have the capacity to constitute an offence if proved before a court: [164]-[165]; [469]; [598].

In relation to (ii)(a)

7.   Director’s duties pursuant to s 184(1) may not be fully satisfied by directors removing themselves from positions of potential conflict. The Corporations Act also imposes positive duties of disclosure on company directors: [473]; [623]-[641].

Centofanti v Eekimitor Pty Ltd (1995) 65 SASR 31, Permanent Building Society (in liq) v Wheeler (1994) 11 WAR 187, Permanent Building Society (in liq) v McGee (1993) 11 ACSR 260, Fitzsimmons v R (1997) 23 ACSR 355, Duke Group Ltd (in liq) v Pilmer (1999) 73 SASR 64, discussed.

8.   A contravention of s 184(1) requires intentional dishonesty or recklessness, which involves a finding that the conduct complained of was dishonest according to ordinary community standards, and known by the director to be so: [376]-[378], [430]; [487]; [636].

SAJ v The Queen [2012] VSCA 243, Marchesi v Barnes [1970] VR 434 discussed.

9.   A deliberate failure to disclose relevant information in circumstances where there is a duty of disclosure and with full knowledge of the relevant facts could be seen to be “intentionally dishonest”: [487]-[489]; [640].

In relation to (ii)(b)

(per Beazley P)

10.   It is necessary to look at the circumstances as a whole. Too narrow a focus on the ultimate knowledge of the person deceived is apt to lead into error: [505].

(per Bathurst CJ and Beazley P)

11.   The offence (s 192E Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) requires that a financial advantage be obtained by deception, and that the person or entity so deceived be identified. Unless and until such deception actually occurs, the necessary element of the offence has not been made out. A causal connection is required between the deception and financial advantage acquired: [350]-[355], [359]; [502], [517].

(per Bathurst CJ, in dissent)

12.   No financial advantage arose from the conduct said to be deceptive. This was because any benefit from concealing the Obeid involvement in the tenement from either the government or the IBC had not crystalised: [364]-[366].

(per Beazley P)

13.   Pursuant to s 192D Crimes Act, the retention of financial value may be temporary: [519].

(per Basten JA)

14.   Maintaining the unrealised value of an asset constitutes obtaining a financial advantage for the purposes of ss 192E and 192D Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), in satisfaction of s 8(2) ICAC Act: [657]-[658].

In relation to (iii)

(per Basten JA, Bathurst CJ and Beazley P agreeing)

15.   To ascertain the scope of the Commission’s obligation to afford procedural fairness, it is necessary to bear in mind the fact-finding and characterisation functions of the Commission, and to have regard to its statutory powers with respect to the conduct of a public inquiry: [453]; [460]; [688].

16.   Where a procedural complaint is raised for the first time on judicial review, an appellant faces the heavy burden of attempting to persuade a court of error in circumstances where little assistance is afforded the court as to how the Commission, with its broad discretionary powers, would have dealt with an argument not presented to it: [698].

In relation to (iv) 

(per Basten JA, Beazley P agreeing)

17.   Having regard to its functions and jurisdiction the Commission has the power to make findings and form opinions extending beyond the question of “corrupt conduct”. The power to formulate recommendations coupled with such findings and opinions, means that such recommendations are, consequently, not dependent on findings of corrupt conduct. These recommendations are amenable to judicial review: [460]; [714], [717].

Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: By orders made on 29 July 2014, a judge of the Equity Division of the Court (the primary judge) dismissed summonses filed by John Vern McGuigan (Mr McGuigan), John Charles Atkinson (Mr Atkinson), Richard Jonathan Poole (Mr Poole) and Travers William Duncan (Mr Duncan) (collectively called the individual appellants) seeking orders that the determination by the respondent, the Independent Commission against Corruption (the Commission), that they had engaged in corrupt conduct within the meaning of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW) (ICAC Act) was wrong in law, made in excess of jurisdiction and was a nullity.
	
	
	By orders made on the same day, the primary judge dismissed the summons filed by Cascade Coal Pty Limited (Cascade), Mt Penny Coal Pty Limited (Mt Penny Coal) and Glendon Brook Coal Pty Limited (Glendon Brook Coal) (collectively called the corporate appellants) seeking declarations that the recommendations of the Commission that the granting of exploration authorities for tenements known as Mt Penny and Glendon Brook (the tenements) was so tainted by corruption that the authorities should be expunged or cancelled and that certain steps be taken to give effect to that conclusion or alternatively that the New South Wales Government refuse to grant a mining lease over the tenements were made without, or in excess of, jurisdiction and were a nullity.
	
	
	The appellants have appealed from the dismissal of the respective summonses.
	


Background


	
	In July 2013, the Commissioner of ICAC presented a report to the President of the Legislative Council and to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly (the report) concerning the circumstances surrounding a decision made in 2008 by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Mineral Resources, the Honourable Ian Macdonald MLC (Mr Macdonald), to grant a coal exploration licence (the Mt Penny exploration licence), referred to as the Mt Penny tenement, including whether that decision was influenced by Mr Edward Obeid (Mr Obeid) or members of his family. For the purposes of this judgment, members of the Obeid family and companies in which they had a controlling interest shall be referred to as “Obeid related entities”.
	
	
	The Mt Penny exploration licence, EL7406, was granted to Mt Penny Coal, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cascade, on 21 October 2009. The individual appellants were directors of the latter company.
	
	
	Prior to the grant of the Mt Penny exploration licence, Cascade, on 5 June 2009, had executed two letter agreements. The first of these agreements was between Cascade and Buffalo Resources Pty Ltd (Buffalo), a company associated with Mr Obeid and his family. That agreement, which was conditional upon Cascade or “an affiliate” being granted the Mt Penny exploration licence, provided for the establishment of a joint venture to explore and develop the licence and pursue the grant of a mining lease. It was provided that Buffalo would have a 25% interest in the joint venture. It also provided that Cascade would use its best endeavours to obtain an exploration licence in respect of areas contiguous to the area the subject of the Mt Penny exploration licence, which would also be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the joint venture. Subsequently, Glendon Brook Coal, another subsidiary of Cascade, acquired exploration licence EL7405 over an area known as the Glendon Brook tenement (the Glendon Brook exploration licence). However, this was not a contiguous area and so was not subject to the agreement.
	
	
	The land the subject of the Mt Penny exploration licence comprised three properties: Cherrydale Park (Cherrydale), Donola and Coggan Creek. Obeid related entities owned the first of these properties and had been granted options to purchase the other two properties. By the second of the letter agreements of 5 June 2009, Cascade agreed, subject to conditions including receipt of mining approval, to purchase the properties at four times their improved value as at 1 June 2009. It will be necessary to refer to these agreements in more detail later in this judgment.
	
	
	The Commission found that prior to 5 June 2009, following discussions with Mr Paul Obeid and Messrs Rocco Triulcio and Rosario Triulcio (the Triulcios), the Triulcios agreed to join in the purchase of Donola using a corporate trustee, Geble Pty Ltd, as the vehicle to complete the purchase. The Commission found that through a series of corporate trusts, 50% of the shares in Donola were beneficially held by Obeid related entities and 50% by entities associated with the Triulcios. The Commission found that this occurred prior to the publication of the government’s intention to call for expressions of interest in respect of the Mt Penny area.
	
	
	The Commission also found that the Obeid family arranged for a family friend, Mr John Lewis, to purchase Coggan Creek. The purchase was completed by a corporate vehicle, Justin Kennedy Lewis Pty Ltd. The Commission found that Mr Lewis had (orally or tacitly) agreed to pay the Obeid family 30% of the profit made from the sale of Coggan Creek. The Commission found these transactions occurred after expressions of interest from the Mt Penny tenement had been called for.
	
	
	Subsequent to the grant of the exploration licences, Cascade began negotiations to enter into an agreement pursuant to which the shareholders in Cascade would sell their shares in that company to White Energy Company Ltd (White Energy), a company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. The total consideration payable was $486 million, payable partly in cash and partly in shares. The proposed agreement was subject to a number of conditions and it will be necessary to refer to it and ancillary agreements entered into at the same time in more detail later in this judgment. However, three of the vendors were companies associated with the individual appellants who were directors of White Energy. In those circumstances, White Energy established an Independent Board Committee (the IBC) comprising Mr Graham Cubbin, Mr Hans Mende and Mr Vincent O’Rourke to consider whether the transaction was in the interests of White Energy. Ultimately the agreement to sell the shares did not proceed.
	
	
	Prior to the commencement of substantive negotiations with White Energy, steps had been taken by Cascade to buy out the Obeid related entities in the joint venture. It appeared that the rights of Buffalo had been assigned to another company associated with Mr Obeid, Southeast Investments Group Pty Ltd (Southeast), although there was no documentation to support such an assignment. The solicitor retained for the Obeid related entities for the purpose of these negotiations, Mr Sevag Chalabian, stated in evidence at the Commission that the company was a shelf company purchased “to disguise the Obeid interest”.
	
	
	By an agreement dated 20 October 2010, which the parties agreed to keep strictly confidential, Southeast agreed to assign the right conferred on it by the agreement of 5 June 2009 to be issued 25% of the shares in Mt Penny to Coal and Mineral Group Pty Ltd (CMG), a company associated with Mr Poole. It should be noted that the letter agreement of 5 June 2009 did not contain an obligation that Buffalo would be issued 25% of shares in Mt Penny, rather, it provided that Buffalo would have a 25% interest in a joint venture in respect of the tenement. The purchase price for the rights was $60 million, payable in what was described as two tranches. It is unnecessary at this stage to set out details of the proposed method of payment. However, the Commission found that $30 million, being the first tranche, made its way into bank accounts of the Obeid family.
	
	
	On the same day, CMG entered into an agreement with Cascade and Mt Penny Coal by which it agreed that the right to be issued 25% of the shares in Mt Penny Coal be terminated in consideration of a total payment of $62 million, $32 million in cash and $30 million in value of Cascade shares, which was said to be the equivalent of 9.3% of Cascade on a fully diluted basis. It is unnecessary to refer to the agreement in any greater detail at this stage.
	
	
	In that way, the interest of Obeid related entities in the joint venture (the Obeid interest) was effectively terminated.
	
	
	The Commission concluded that what had occurred involved corrupt conduct on the part of the individual appellants within the meaning of s 8(2) of the ICAC Act. The Commission’s findings against Messrs Macdonald, Obeid, Moses Obeid and the individual appellants were summarised by it in the following terms:
	


“The Commission found that Mr Macdonald engaged in corrupt conduct by:

a)    entering into an agreement with Edward Obeid Sr and Moses Obeid whereby he acted contrary to his public duty as a minister of the Crown by arranging for the creation of the Mount Penny tenement for the purpose of benefiting Edward Obeid Sr, Moses Obeid and other members of the Obeid family

b)   entering into an agreement with Edward Obeid Sr and Moses Obeid whereby he acted contrary to his public duty as a minister of the Crown by providing Moses Obeid or other members of the Obeid family with confidential information for the purpose of benefiting Edward Obeid Sr, Moses Obeid and other members of the Obeid family

c)   deciding to reopen the EOIs process for exploration licences in order to favour Mr Duncan

d)   providing Mr Duncan with confidential information, being the document titled “Proposed NSW Coal Allocations”, and advice that the process for EOIs in coal release areas was to be reopened.

The Commission found that Edward Obeid Sr engaged in corrupt conduct by:

a)   entering into an agreement with Mr Macdonald whereby Mr Macdonald acted contrary to his public duty as a minister of the Crown by arranging for the creation of the Mount Penny tenement for the purpose of benefiting Edward Obeid Sr, Moses Obeid and other members of the Obeid family

b)   entering into an agreement with Mr Macdonald whereby Mr Macdonald acted contrary to his public duty as a minister of the Crown by providing Moses Obeid or other members of the Obeid family with confidential information for the purpose of benefiting Edward Obeid Sr, Moses Obeid and other members of the Obeid family.

The Commission found that Moses Obeid engaged in corrupt conduct by:

a)    entering into an agreement with Mr Macdonald whereby Mr Macdonald acted contrary to his public duty as minister of the Crown by arranging for the creation of the Mount Penny tenement for the purpose of benefiting Edward Obeid Sr, Moses Obeid and other members of the Obeid family

b)   entering into an agreement with Mr Macdonald whereby Mr Macdonald acted contrary to his public duty as a minister of the Crown by providing Moses Obeid or other members of the Obeid family with confidential information for the purpose of benefiting Edward Obeid Sr, Moses Obeid and other members of the Obeid family.

The Commission found that Mr Duncan engaged in corrupt conduct by:

a)   deliberately misleading Graham Cubbin (the chairman of White Energy’s IBC) as to the Obeid family involvement in the Mount Penny tenement by failing to disclose the involvement to Mr Cubbin when Mr Cubbin raised the issue with him,

b)   deliberately failing to disclose to the IBC the fact of the Obeid family involvement despite knowing that the IBC was concerned with any such involvement,

c)   telling Anthony Levi that John McGuigan would directly contact Mr Cubbin and thereby relieving Mr Levi from having to answer Mr Cubbin’s request for information about the Obeid family involvement, and

d)   authorising Mr Poole to arrange for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture through arrangements involving Coal & Minerals Group Pty Ltd (‘Coal & Minerals Group’) and Southeast Investments Group Pty Ltd (‘Southeast Investments’),

with the intention, in each case, of deceiving relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in the Mount Penny tenement.

The Commission found that John McGuigan engaged in corrupt conduct by:

a)    deliberately failing to disclose to the IBC the fact of the Obeid family involvement despite knowing that the IBC was concerned with any such involvement,

b)   telling Mr Levi that he (John McGuigan) would directly contact Mr Cubbin and thereby relieving Mr Levi from having to answer Mr Cubbin’s request for information about the Obeid family involvement, and

c)   authorising Mr Poole to arrange for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture through arrangements involving Coal & Minerals Group and Southeast Investments,

with the intention, in each case, of deceiving relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in the Mount Penny tenement.    

The Commission found that Mr Atkinson engaged in corrupt conduct by:

a)    deliberately failing to disclose to the IBC the fact of the Obeid family involvement despite knowing that the IBC was concerned with any such involvement,

b)   authorising Mr Poole to arrange for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture through arrangements involving Coal & Minerals Group and Southeast Investments,

with the intention, in each case, of deceiving relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in the Mount Penny tenement.

…

The Commission found that Mr Poole engaged in corrupt conduct by:

a)   deliberately failing to disclose to the IBC the fact of the Obeid family involvement despite knowing that the IBC was concerned with any such involvement,

b)   telling the IBC that he was not aware of any payments having been made to Edward Obeid Sr or any entities associated with him, and

c)   arranging for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture through arrangements involving Coal & Minerals Group and Southeast Investments,   

with the intention, in each case, of deceiving relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in the Mount Penny tenement.”


	
	The findings against Messrs Macdonald, Edward Obeid and Moses Obeid are not challenged on the appeal.
	
	
	In a subsequent report, presented in December 2013 (the third report), the Commission recommended that the Mt Penny exploration licence and the Glendon Brook exploration licence be terminated or that a mining lease be refused. It is that recommendation which is the subject of the corporate appellants’ appeal.

(6)   The specific mention of a kind of conduct in a provision of this section shall not be regarded as limiting the scope of any other provision of this section.”


	
	Section 9 imposes a limitation on Section 8. It provides as follows:
	


“9 Limitation on nature of corrupt conduct

(1)   Despite section 8, conduct does not amount to corrupt conduct unless it could constitute or involve:

   (a)   a criminal offence, or

   (b)   a disciplinary offence, or

(c)   reasonable grounds for dismissing, dispensing with the services of or otherwise terminating the services of a public official, or

(d)   in the case of conduct of a Minister of the Crown or a member of a House of Parliament – a substantial breach of an applicable code of conduct.

(2)   It does not matter that proceedings or action for such an offence can no longer be brought or continued, or that action for such dismissal, dispensing or other termination can no longer be taken.

(3)   For the purposes of this section:

applicable code of conduct means, in relation to:

(a)    a Minister of the Crown – a ministerial code of conduct prescribed or adopted for the purposes of this section by the regulations, or

(b)    a member of the Legislative Council or of the Legislative Assembly (including a Minister of the Crown) – a code of conduct adopted for the purposes of this section by resolution of the House concerned.

criminal offence means a criminal offence under the law of the State or under any other law relevant to the conduct in question.

disciplinary offence includes any misconduct, irregularity, neglect of duty, breach of discipline or other matter that constitutes or may constitute grounds for disciplinary action under any law.

(4)   Subject to subsection (5), conduct of a Minister of the Crown or a member of a House of Parliament which falls within the description of corrupt conduct in section 8 is not excluded by this section if it is conduct that would cause a reasonable person to believe that it would bring the integrity of the office concerned or of Parliament into serious disrepute.

(5)   Without otherwise limiting the matters that it can under section 74A (1) include in a report under section 74, the Commission is not authorised to include a finding or opinion that a specified person has, by engaging in conduct of a kind referred to in subsection (4), engaged in corrupt conduct, unless the Commission is satisfied that the conduct constitutes a breach of a law (apart from this Act) and the Commission identifies that law in the report.

(6)   A reference to a disciplinary offence in this section and sections 74A and 74B includes a reference to a substantial breach of an applicable requirement of a code of conduct required to be complied with under section 440 (5) of the Local Government Act 1993, but does not include a reference to any other breach of such a requirement.”


	
	Section 13(3A) provides for circumstances in which the Commission can find that a person had engaged in conduct falling within s 9(1). It is in the following terms:
	


“13 Principal functions

(3A)   The Commission may make a finding that a person has engaged or is engaging in corrupt conduct of a kind described in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of section 9 (1) only if satisfied that a person has engaged in or is engaging in conduct that constitutes or involves an offence or thing of the kind described in that paragraph.”


	
	Sections 74, 74A and 74B of the ICAC Act deal with the preparation and contents of reports. They provide as follows:
	


“74 Reports on referred matters etc

(1)   The Commission may prepare reports in relation to any matter that has been or is the subjective of an investigation.

(2)   The Commission shall prepare reports in relation to a matter referred to the Commission by both Houses of Parliament, as directed by those Houses.

(5), (6) (Repealed)

(7)   A report required under this section shall be furnished as soon as possible after the Commission has concluded its involvement in the matter.

(9)   (Repealed)

74A Content of reports to Parliament

(1)    The Commission is authorised to include in a report under section 74:

(a)   statements as to any of its findings, opinions and recommendations, and

(b)   statements as to the Commission’s reasons for any of its findings, opinions and recommendations.

(2)   The report must include, in respect of each ‘affected’ person, a statement as to whether or not in all the circumstances the Commission is of the opinion that consideration should be given to the following:

(a)   obtaining the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions with respect to the prosecution of the person for a specified criminal offence,

(b)   the taking of action against the person for a specified disciplinary offence,

(c)   the taking of action against the person as a public official on specified grounds, with a view to dismissing, dispensing with the services of or otherwise terminating the services of the public official.

(3)   An ‘affected’ person is a person described as such in the reference made by both Houses of Parliament or against whom, in the Commission’s opinion, substantial allegations have been made in the course of or in connection with the investigation concerned.

(4)   Subsection (2) does not limit the kinds of statement that a report can contain concerning any such ‘affected’ person and does not prevent a report from containing a statement described in that subsection in respect of any other person.

74B Report not to include findings etc of guilt or recommending prosecution

(1)   The Commission is not authorised to include in a report under section 74 a statement as to:

(a)   a finding or opinion that a specified person is guilty of or has committed, is committing or is about to commit a criminal offence or disciplinary offence (whether or not a specified criminal offence or disciplinary offence), or

(b)   a recommendation that a specified person be, or an opinion that a specified person should be, prosecuted for a criminal offence or disciplinary offence (whether or not a specified criminal offence or disciplinary offence).

(2)   A finding or opinion that a person has engaged, is engaging or is about to engage:

(a)   in corrupt conduct (whether or not specified corrupt conduct), or

(b)   in specified conduct (being conduct that constitutes or involves or could constitute or involve corrupt conduct),

is not a finding or opinion that the person is guilty of or has committed, is committing or is about to commit a criminal offence or disciplinary offence.

(3)   In this section and section 74A, criminal offence and disciplinary offence have the same meanings as in section 9.”


	
	In Independent Commission Against Corruption (NSW) v Cunneen [2015] HCA 14; 89 ALJR 475 (Cunneen), a majority of the High Court held that the expression “adversely affects” in s 8(2) refers to conduct adversely affecting the probity of the exercise of an official function by a public officer: at [42], [50]. In that case, the majority, at [2], made the following remarks concerning the meaning of adversely affects in s 8(2):
	


“[2]   ‘Adversely affect’ is a protean expression. In this context, however, there are only two possibilities. Either it means adversely affect or could adversely affect the probity of the exercise of an official function by a public official, or it means adversely affect or could adversely affect the efficacy of the exercise of an official function by a public official in the sense that the official could exercise the function in a different manner or make a different decision from that which would otherwise be the case.”


	
	Following the decision of the High Court, the parliament passed the Independent Commission Against Corruption Amendment (Validation) Act 2015 (NSW) (Validation Act). It was common ground that the effect of that Act, so far as is relevant to the present case, was to include, within conduct falling within s 8(2) of the ICAC Act, conduct which could adversely affect the efficacy of the exercise of official functions by a public official. The validity of that Act was upheld by the High Court in Duncan v Independent Commissioner Against Corruption (NSW) [2015] HCA 32; 89 ALJR 835.
	
	
	However, there remain a number of issues of construction relevant to the appeal which are dealt with below.
	


The Commission Report


	
	As I have indicated, the report dealt not only with conduct of the individual appellants but also that of Messrs Macdonald, Obeid, Moses Obeid and other members of Mr Obeid’s family. In the first chapter of the report, the Commission identified the range of matters into which it inquired. They included the following:
	


“1.    The circumstances surrounding a decision made in 2008 by the then minister for primary industries and minister for mineral resources, the Hon Ian Macdonald MLC, to grant a coal exploration licence, referred to as the Mount Penny tenement, in the Bylong Valley. The circumstances in question include whether that decision was not impartially made and was influenced by the Hon Edward Obeid MLC (‘Edward Obeid Sr’) or members of his family (whether on Edward Obeid Sr’s behalf or otherwise).

2.    Mr Macdonald’s role in the decision of the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI), in about September 2008, to call for limited expressions of interest (EOIs) for the awarding of exploration licences in respect of the coalmining allocation areas known as Mount Penny, Glendon Brook and Yarrawa.

3.    The circumstances surrounding the tenders made by Monaro Mining NL (‘Monaro Mining’) for exploration licences in respect of the coalmining allocation areas known as Mount Penny, Glendon Brook and Yarrawa and the awarding of those licences.

4.   The roles of Mr Macdonald and Travers Duncan in the decision in November 2008 to reopen the EOI process for the awarding of exploration licences in 11 coalmining areas and to extend further invitations to additional mining companies, including Cascade Coal Pty Ltd (‘Cascade’).

…

7.    Whether Mr Macdonald, or any member of his personal staff, or any employee of the DPI, improperly provided confidential information relating to the reopening of the EOI process and other confidential information in respect of the Mount Penny exploration licence to Mr Duncan or any other person.

8.   The circumstances under which Voope Pty Ltd (‘Voope’) acquired an interest in Monaro Coal Pty Ltd (‘Monaro Coal’), and under which the Yarrawa exploration licence was awarded to Loyal Coal Pty Ltd (‘Loyal Coal’). The name of Loyal Coal was formerly Monaro Coal.

9.    The circumstances surrounding the bid made by Cascade for the Mount Penny exploration licence and the awarding of that exploration licence to Cascade.

10.   The circumstances relating to the entering into of a joint venture involving Monaro Mining, the Obeid family, or any members of that family or entities associated with that family such as Buffalo Resources Pty Ltd (‘Buffalo Resources’), and Cascade.

…

13.   The circumstances relating to the intended sale of shares in Cascade to White Energy Company Ltd (‘White Energy’).

14.   The roles played by Mr Macdonald, members of the Obeid family, Mr Duncan, Richard Poole, John McGuigan, James McGuigan, John Kinghorn, John Atkinson and Greg Jones in the transactions described in paragraphs 9 to 13 above.”


	
	In Appendix 2 to the report, the Commission stated its approach to the inquiry was first, to make relevant findings of fact on the balance of probabilities, then to determine whether these facts came within the terms of s 8(1) or s 8(2) of the ICAC Act. If they did, the Commission stated that it then considered s 9 of the Act and the jurisdictional requirements in s 13(3A).
	
	
	The Commission also said that the civil standard of proof had been applied by it in making factual findings. The Commission stated that because of the seriousness of the findings, it had regard to what was said by Dixon J in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34; 60 CLR 336 (Briginshaw) at 362, and by the High Court in Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd [1992] HCA 66; 67 ALJR 170 at 171.
	
	
	Chapter 2 of the report sets out the background of the investigation, the course of the investigation and the evidence obtained as a result.
	
	
	The Commission recorded in that chapter that in February 2011, it received an allegation from a private individual that confidential information regarding the 2008 public tender for the awarding of the Mt Penny tenement had been “leaked” to members of Mr Obeid’s family.
	
	
	The Commission recorded that the tenement covered Cherrydale, owned by the Obeids, and Donola and Coggan Creek, finding, as I indicated above, that the Obeid family had an interest in each of those properties. The Commission found that the grant of the Mt Penny exploration licence substantially increased the value of the properties.
	
	
	In that chapter, the Commission also indicated that the Minister for Primary Industries and Mineral Resources, Mr Macdonald, determined that the call for expressions of interest (EOIs) for the award of exploration authorities in the area should be confined to junior miners. It indicated that there was evidence that Mr Moses Obeid had come into possession of confidential information identifying the companies to be invited to lodge a tender. The Commission found that a merchant banker acting on behalf of Mr Moses Obeid, Mr Paul Gardner Brook (Mr Brook), had used the information to agree with Monaro Mining NL (Monaro), one of the companies to be invited to lodge EOIs, that in the event of its bid being successful, Voope Pty Ltd (Voope), a company associated with the Obeid family and Mr Brook, would acquire 88% of Monaro. The Obeid family held 80% of the shares in Voope and Mr Brook held 12%.
	
	
	The Commission stated that it discovered that what it described as a series of complex transactions had occurred with respect to Monaro’s rights to the bids it had made. It stated that it discovered that Monaro transferred the benefit of its bids to a subsidiary, Monaro Coal Pty Ltd. That company’s shares were acquired by Voope and its name was changed to Loyal Coal Pty Ltd (Loyal Coal).
	
	
	The Commission found that the EOI process was reopened so that Cascade and other parties could participate. It found that following the agreement of 5 June 2009, to which I have referred above at [6], Loyal Coal withdrew its bids for Mt Penny and Glendon Brook and on 19 June 2009, the licences for those areas were awarded to Cascade.
	
	
	The Commission indicated that it became aware of the transactions referred to above at [12] and [13], and the proposed sale to White Energy referred to above at [10]. It stated that it obtained evidence that investors in Cascade were concerned that the Obeids’ involvement in the creation of the Mt Penny tenement or their involvement in the joint venture may become public. It said the investors feared two risks: first, that the independent shareholders of White Energy might not go through with the purchase and second, that the NSW Government might investigate the creation of the Mt Penny tenement and set it aside or refuse to grant a mining lease. It stated that there was evidence that the Cascade investors took steps to ensure the Obeid involvement remained hidden.
	
	
	Chapter 4 of the report dealt, among other things, with the credibility of Messrs Macdonald, Obeid, Moses Obeid and other members of the Obeid family. The Commission indicated that it regarded all of them as unreliable witnesses.
	
	
	In Chapter 6 of the report, the Commission found that Mr Obeid and members of his family stood to benefit from at least “four avenues” relating to the Mt Penny tenement: first, on the sale of Cherrydale, Donola and Coggan Creek, second, by the $30 million paid by Cascade through CMG under the agreement referred to above at [12], third, through receipt of the balance owing under that agreement and fourth, from a recent acquisition of shares in Cascade.
	
	
	Chapter 7 of the report dealt with the relationship between Messrs Macdonald, Obeid and Moses Obeid. The Commission found that there was a close and long-term relationship between Messrs Macdonald and Obeid and that, as from May 2008, the relationship between Messrs Macdonald and Moses Obeid developed into one of friendship and frequent contact. The Commission summarised its findings, which were dealt with in more detail in subsequent chapters of the report, that Mr Macdonald agreed with Mr Obeid that he would create the Mt Penny tenement over Cherrydale, that Moses Obeid became a party to that agreement and that the agreement extended to Mr Macdonald agreeing to provide confidential information to Mr Moses Obeid relating to the creation of mining tenements in the Bylong Valley, including over Cherrydale and properties in its vicinity. As this finding was not disputed, it is unnecessary to deal with the evidence which led the Commission to that conclusion.
	
	
	In Chapter 9 of the report, the Commission referred to the evidence of Mr Moses Obeid that Mr Macdonald told him, in late May or early June 2008, that the Department of Primary Industries intended to open exploration licences in the Bylong Valley and, as a result, Mr Moses Obeid thought the best course was to “option up”, namely to take options over Donola and Coggan Creek. It noted that Mr Moses Obeid admitted the information was not publicly available and stated that the information was of a highly confidential nature which enabled the Obeid family to make a great deal of money. The Commission also inferred that Mr Macdonald told Mr Moses Obeid that the licence would cover Cherrydale.
	
	
	In Chapter 10, the Commission concluded that when Mr Macdonald called for information on the coal resources in the Mt Penny area, he did so at the instigation of Mr Obeid and in terms of the agreement he reached with him and Mr Moses Obeid to create the tenement over Cherrydale. The Commission found that at the time he did so, he was fully aware of the location of Cherrydale, that there was coal under and around that property and that Messrs Obeid and Moses Obeid had sought information from him with the intent they could profit from it. Although issue was taken on the appeal with the concept of “creating” the tenement, no challenge was made to the factual findings.
	
	
	In Chapter 15, the Commission concluded that it was Mr Macdonald who directed that a Mt Penny tenement be created. It found that the decision was made without notice, without deliberation and without a Department of Primary Industry briefing. It also concluded that Mr Macdonald was responsible for the idea of reducing the tenement in size so that it would fit the criterion of a small to medium sized mine. The Commission concluded that Mr Macdonald gave that instruction with the specific intent that the instruction would result in the Mt Penny tenement being created over Cherrydale. Once again, these findings were not disputed on the appeal.
	
	
	In Chapter 16 of the report, the Commission noted that there were two other aspects of the EOI process that were the subject of particular direction by Mr Macdonald. The first was that participation in the EOI process would be by invitation only. The second was that the invitation would be limited to junior miners. It noted that the limitation on invitees was contrary to NSW Government policy, which called for an open process, and undermined Mr Macdonald’s express desire to create competitive tension. It referred to the evidence of the Chief Executive Officer of the New South Wales Minerals Council that the decision to limit the process to small or medium sized companies was unprecedented and that the decision was contrary to the interests of the State. However, it concluded that it had the effect of Mr Macdonald knowing who was on the list of invitees which, it said, was convenient if Mr Macdonald wished to supply information to a third party. It also concluded that the limitation to junior miners meant that the type of companies on the list were those that might be more amenable to entering into a joint venture, for example, with one of the landowners of the tenement.
	
	
	In Chapter 17 of the report, the Commission asserted that owning land within the boundaries of a newly declared mining tenement can bring large and rapid financial rewards. It stated that coal mining companies are willing to pay multiples of the ordinary value of rural properties. It stated that that made early knowledge of the likely creation of a coal mining tenement extremely valuable information. It concluded that members of the Obeid family were given early information by Mr Macdonald that a new tenement was to be created in the Bylong Valley, which was sufficiently detailed to enable the Obeid family to know where the tenement was to be located.
	
	
	In that chapter, the Commission referred to the fact that the files of the Obeids’ family solicitors, Colin Biggers & Paisley, demonstrated that Mr Moses Obeid and his brothers had advance knowledge of the Mt Penny tenement and were using it as the basis to purchase Donola and Coggan Creek in order to make windfall profits once the creation of the tenement became public knowledge.
	
	
	In relation to the purchase of Donola, the Commission concluded that the adoption of a trust structure was done for the sole purpose of disguising the Obeid involvement and because it may otherwise have surfaced that the Obeids had received confidential information from Mr Macdonald.
	
	
	None of the findings in Chapter 17 were disputed on appeal.
	
	
	In Chapter 19 of the report, the Commission concluded that Mr Moses Obeid sought the list of companies who were to be invited to lodge EOIs because he wanted to provide it to Mr Brook to initiate a mining venture and that Mr Macdonald willingly provided the list. The Commission also found that Mr Moses Obeid provided the list to Mr Brook and that it was used successfully to identify a potential “medium for their introduction into coal mining”, namely Monaro.
	
	
	Chapter 20 of the report dealt with the involvement of Monaro. The Commission recorded that on 20 August 2008, Mr Warwick Grigor, the non-executive Chairman of Monaro, entered into an agreement with Voope on behalf of Monaro entitled “Option Deed Over Shares”, which the Commission described as extraordinarily lopsided. It was said to impose a large number of obligations on Monaro which carried with them substantial financial commitments, whilst entitling Voope to obtain 80% of the benefit of those tenements at no cost. The Commission found that the circumstantial evidence pointed strongly to the conclusion that Mr Grigor was being provided with confidential information. It concluded that the Obeid family was using the information to enable them to enter into the agreement with Monaro, which it said became the key to the Obeid family receiving a massive payout.
	
	
	In Chapter 22 of the report, the Commission noted that Monaro resolved to make bids in respect of nine of the 11 new coal areas, including Mt Penny and Glendon Brook. The Commission stated that it seemed to be Monaro’s intention to seek financial backing if and when it was awarded exploration licences.
	
	
	The EOI process required responses to be made by 24 November 2008. Despite this, the Commission found, in Chapter 24 of the report, that in October 2008 Mr Macdonald began to speak of reopening the EOI process to allow other mining companies to compete. The Commission concluded that it was Mr Macdonald’s decision to reopen the process and that he was motivated to do so as a favour to Mr Duncan. In support of the conclusion that Mr Macdonald reopened the EOI process at the request of Mr Duncan, the Commission pointed to the fact that Messrs Macdonald and Duncan had a close working relationship which, it said, extended beyond an ordinary working relationship.
	
	
	The Commission noted that each of Messrs Macdonald and Duncan denied that Mr Duncan had made a request to reopen the process. However, it concluded that at times, the evidence of Mr Duncan was demonstrably unreliable and as such, it did not accept his evidence on this matter.
	
	
	In support of its conclusion, the Commission relied on an email of 1 October 2008 from Mr Craig Munnings, a Department of Primary Industries liaison officer in Mr Macdonald’s office, to Mr Jamie Gibson, Mr Macdonald’s Deputy Chief of Staff, to the effect that he had been advised that Mr Alan Coutts, the Deputy Director General of Mineral Resources, was not prepared to give EOI packages to four companies: Amerod Resources, White Energy, Real Brand Holdings and Cascade. The email noted that Mr Coutts had already informed Mr Gibson of that fact.
	
	
	The Commission referred to the evidence of Mr Gibson that he made the request of Mr Coutts on the instruction of Mr Macdonald and that prior to that instruction, he had not heard of the four companies. The companies were all companies associated with Mr Duncan and the Commission inferred that Mr Macdonald became aware of these companies as a result of Mr Duncan speaking to him. The Commission also relied on the evidence of Mr Coutts, to the effect that Mr Gibson told him that Mr Duncan wanted to obtain the opportunity for the tenements, and to a note from the Managing Director of Monaro that the Department of Primary Industries had reopened the process to allow the “White Group” to participate.
	
	
	However, the Commission found that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Mr Duncan put any pressure, inappropriate or otherwise, on Mr MacDonald to reopen the EOI process, which it said precluded a finding of corrupt conduct against him in connection with the reopening.
	
	
	In Chapter 25 of the report, the Commission found that Mr Duncan had accessed government information that came directly from Mr Macdonald. The Commission referred to evidence that Mr McGuigan gave a document titled “Proposed NSW Coal Allocation” to his son, Mr James McGuigan, on 29 November 2008, saying at the time that he had heard rumours that the allocation process was going to be reopened. Mr McGuigan said that the likely source of the information was Mr Duncan. The Commission concluded that the information came from Mr Macdonald through Mr Duncan.
	
	
	The Commission concluded that the information was valuable as indicating where the government was considering opening areas for the grant of exploration licences. However, it should be noted that the areas in question did not turn out to be part of the EOI process.
	
	
	In the circumstances, the Commission found that Mr Macdonald made a partial decision to benefit Mr Duncan when he reopened the EOI process and disclosed the confidential information.
	
	
	In Chapter 26, the Commission referred to the fact that the EOI Evaluation Committee decided Monaro should succeed in respect of six of its nine bids, including its bids for Mt Penny and Glendon Brook. However, before these arrangements could be finalised, Monaro withdrew its bids in respect of these tenements. The Commission found that the board of Monaro concluded that with no firm finance facility for the bids, it should seek to get out of its obligations on the best possible terms. As a result, Monaro entered into an agreement with Voope, which provided that the Monaro subsidiary, which was successful in the bid process, was to change its name to Loyal Coal and its shares were to be transferred by Monaro to Voope.
	
	
	The Commission found that following that transaction, a series of meetings took place between Messrs Moses Obeid, McGuigan and Jones, the latter being another investor in Cascade. The Commission found that Messrs McGuigan and Jones had been introduced to Mr Moses Obeid in connection with another unrelated transaction.
	
	
	The Commission found that at the second meeting, Mr McGuigan drew up a form of Heads of Agreement which formed the basis of the agreement of 5 June 2009. The document was described as the “Key Principles” document. The Commission said the second meeting was important because all of the parties were open about the fact that the Obeids were linked to the mining side of the transaction; a fact which it said was quite evident from the Key Principles document.
	
	
	The Commission found that after the second meeting, Mr Poole took over the negotiations on behalf of Cascade. The Commission found that at one of the meetings, agreement was reached that the Obeids would use a “cleanskin” company, Buffalo, to cover their involvement. The Commission also referred to the two agreements of 5 June 2009. In relation to the agreement referred to above at [6], the Commission made the following remarks:
	


“The key components to the mining venture agreement were that, in the event that an exploration licence were granted to Cascade in respect of Mount Penny, the parties agreed to form a joint venture “to explore and develop” the area with a view to obtaining mining approval. It was further agreed that, as joint venturers, they would, if they could, pursue the development “over the area contiguous to” Mount Penny. The agreement then went on to provide as follows:

In recognition of Buffalo’s intellectual property contribution and in consideration of Buffalo:

●    and its associates or related parties including Gardner Brook and Loyal Coal Pty Ltd withdrawing any existing applications in relation to Mount Penny and Glendon Brook Coal Release Areas and undertaking not to pursue the grant of any mining rights to the Area or any Contiguous Area, or the Glendon Brook EOI Coal Release Area;

●   agreeing to assist Cascade to explore and develop the Exploration Licence and obtain the Mining Approvals;

●    agreeing to make available and provide their expert knowledge of the Area to assist with further exploration and review of the Contiguous Area.

Cascade agrees to:

●    vest 100% of its interest in the Exploration Licence in the JV; and

●    grant to Buffalo a 25% interest in the JV

There are several troubling aspects to the above part of the agreement. Buffalo Resources was receiving a substantial benefit under the agreement – 25% of a potentially extremely valuable coalmining tenement – but what was it giving in return? Part of the consideration is said to be ‘Buffalo’s intellectual property contribution’, but it was readily conceded that nobody behind Buffalo Resources had any experience or knowledge in the area of coalmining or coalmine development. It does not appear that Buffalo Resources truly had any ‘intellectual property’ that it could contribute. Similarly, Buffalo Resources did not have skills that would enable it to ‘assist Cascade to explore and develop the area’ and did not have any ‘expert knowledge’ that could enable exploration of contiguous areas. In short, these items specified as consideration were shams and no consideration at all.

That leaves only one item that Buffalo Resources was providing in return – arranging the withdrawal of the bids made by Loyal Coal in respect of Mount Penny and Glendon Brook.”


	
	The Commission rejected Mr Duncan’s denial that he had knowledge of the negotiations which led to the 5 June 2009 agreements. The Commission referred to the fact that Mr Duncan gave evidence that he was critical of a proposal to give the Obeids a 30% interest in the venture and Mr McGuigan subsequently told him he had negotiated a 25% interest.
	
	
	The Commission referred to what it described as the critical feature of the agreement, namely that Loyal Coal would withdraw its bid. The Commission found that Messrs Moses Obeid and Brook ramped up negotiations by telling Cascade that they had inside information that Monaro was going to succeed and Cascade would come second.
	
	
	The Commission found that on 28 May 2009, there was a meeting at the office of Mr Macdonald at which he was informed of the successful bidders. The Commission found that there was no evidence the names of the companies which came second in the evaluation process were read out at that meeting. However, the Commission concluded that Mr Macdonald told Mr Moses Obeid the companies which were successful in the bidding process. This finding was not challenged on the appeal. The Commission also found that Messrs Moses Obeid and Brook were using the information as part of a negotiating strategy. The Commission however declined to find that Mr Macdonald told Mr Moses Obeid who had come second in the bidding process.
	
	
	In Chapter 27, the Commission found that, as at 5 June 2009, each of Messrs McGuigan and Poole knew Cascade was entering into a mining venture backed by the Obeid family and that, as at 5 June 2009, they knew that Buffalo was a corporate entity, majority controlled by that family. The Commission referred to: the evidence of Mr Brook, who participated in the negotiations, that there was no doubt that the Obeids were on the other side of the transaction with Cascade; the evidence of Mr Jones that the Obeids were behind the 25% interest in the joint venture and that he discussed that matter with Messrs McGuigan and Poole; and finally the evidence of Messrs Moses Obeid and James McGuigan to similar effect. The Commission concluded that it was evident from the Key Principles Document, drafted by Mr McGuigan, that Mr McGuigan knew of the involvement of the Obeids both on the mining side and property side of the transaction. It rejected the evidence of Mr McGuigan to the effect that he thought that sometime after 31 May 2009, the Obeids may have dropped out of the mining venture.
	
	
	The Commission also rejected the evidence of Mr Poole that he did not know the Obeids were involved in the mining venture as at 5 June 2009 and did not actually know until after August 2010. It referred to the evidence of Mr Duncan indicating to Mr Poole that he wished to have the Obeids removed from the venture and the negotiations with Mr Chalabian on that issue. It also considered that it was inconceivable that Mr Poole did not know of the Obeids’ involvement by 5 June 2009 having regard to the evidence of Messrs Jones, James McGuigan and McGuigan on this issue. It also stated that its conclusion was supported by an email from Mr Brook on 3 June 2009 sent by Mr Brook to Mr James McGuigan and copied to Mr Poole, which spoke of Mr Brook “consulting with Moses” upon the terms of the mining transaction.
	
	
	In Chapter 29 of the report, the Commission referred to the relationship between the individual appellants and White Energy. It pointed to the fact that each of the individual appellants, together with Messrs Jones, John Kinghorn (Mr Kinghorn) and Brian Flannery, were the investors in Cascade. It also pointed to the fact that White Energy was a major company with an interest in coal technology and that there was a close connection between the management and ownership of White Energy and the circle of investors involved in Cascade. It pointed to the fact that Mr Duncan was the Chairman of Directors of White Energy; Mr Atkinson had been its Managing Director and remained on the board and Mr McGuigan was also a Director of that company. It also pointed out that Mr Poole had a pre-existing connection with White Energy as a financial advisor and as the controller of a “substantial” shareholding in White Energy.
	
	
	The Commission stated that it was not clear who amongst the Cascade investors first had the idea to sell the asset to White Energy, although it noted that Mr Atkinson said that it may have been him. It stated that there were records provided by Arthur Phillip Pty Ltd (a company controlled by Mr Poole) that it was advising on the sale as early as February 2010.
	
	
	The Commission found that the initiation and course of negotiations between Cascade and White Energy remained obscure. It referred to the evidence of Mr Duncan that he, Messrs McGuigan, Kinghorn, Atkinson and Poole arrived at the number of $500 million. However, it pointed out that Mr Duncan could not explain who it was at White Energy who agreed to take out an option at that price.
	
	
	The Commission referred to the following evidence of Mr Duncan concerning the negotiations:
	


“Now I’m talking about after the deal was announced with White Energy I’m talking about before the deal was announced. You were a director of Cascade at the time – were you the person who put the valuation on the asset for Cascade? --- I was involved in the valuation of Cascade.

Who else was involved? --- I think all the shareholders were involved.

Well, who, name them? --- I think Mr Poole, Mr Atkinson, Mr McGuigan, I think Mr Kinghorn.

Mr Flannery? --- No, I don’t believe so.

All right. Mr Jones? --- I don’t recall discussing the price with him.

…So McGuigan, Kinghorn, Atkinson, Poole and Duncan were the people at Cascade Coal who put the valuation on the Cascade Coal asset? --- Arrived at a number that was offered.”

Mr Duncan could not explain who it was at White Energy who agreed to take out an option at a price of $500 million:

“At the time it was agreed that White Energy would take the option of $500 million? Who were the people at White Energy who worked out the value of Cascade Coal? --- I don’t know who worked out - - -

…

Well, you see, when it was presented to the Independent Board Committee that Independent Board Committee was looking at an option which put a value on Cascade of $500 million, do you accept that? --- Yes.

I want to know who were the people at White Energy who put the valuation on Cascade? --- I believe Cascade Coal made an offer to White Energy - - - Sorry, stop for a second, we know, we know these sorts of things. I want, you want to buy my car, I offer this, you offer that, a bit of negotiation.

…

Who at White Energy thought that this was worth looking at in the sense that they looked at it and thought the offer presents a reasonable offer at a valuation of $500 million? Who was that? Was that you? --- No, the board received it and there was abstentions from people having discussions on it and I asked for Graham Cubbin, I specifically asked Graham Cubbin to form an independent committee of the three directors on the board of White’s that did not have an interest in Cascade and for him to make the – well, for that to make the decision whether they would accept the month’s long option to examine the exercise.”

As for the negotiations, Mr Duncan gave this evidence:

“Now you were a shareholder [sic] Cascade Coal and you were the chairman of the board of White Energy? --- Yes.

I’m asking you who was involved with the discussions on the side of Cascade Coal the company of which you were a shareholder?

THE COMMISSIONER: You see, Mr Duncan, this is before the board was appointed so the question that Mr Watson is asking you concerns a period before the board was appointed. Who was involved in those discussions? --- Well, I would have been.

On behalf of whom? --- On behalf of White’s.

Right. But you were also a shareholder of Cascade? --- But I wasn’t a director of Cascade.

…

No. But you – this refers to discussions between White Energy and shareholders of Cascade. Do you see that? --- Yes, but it doesn’t say all the shareholders of Cascade.

…

MR WATSON: Well, you were a shareholder of Cascade and the head of the board at White Energy, did you have the discussion with yourself --- That would have been a very interesting discussion I would have been able to arrive at a decision straightaway.

Who else was there? --- I don’t recall who was there.

Are you trying? --- No, and I don’t even recall the discussion but it says it in the letter so it must have occurred.

Well, you, I think agreed that you were probably there wearing a White Energy hat? --- That’s correct.

And who would you have been likely to discuss this with? --- Most likely with Mr Poole.”


	
	The Commission stated that it was clear from that evidence that even Mr Duncan did not have a clear idea whether he was acting on behalf of Cascade or White Energy when the deal was negotiated. The Commission concluded that the most likely position was that the most active of the investors in Cascade, which the Commission said included the individual appellants, were acting on both sides of the transaction and agreed the price would be $500 million.
	
	
	Chapters 30 and 31 of the report are critical to the findings against the individual appellants. Chapter 30 dealt with the removal of the Obeid interest from the venture.
	
	
	The Commission pointed out that by early 2010, Mr Obeid was a controversial figure and any transaction in which he was involved that concerned State assets was bound to attract publicity. It stated that members of the Obeid family acknowledged this, and gave it as a reason why they insisted on privacy. At the time of the proposed transaction with White Energy, there had been some public discussion concerning the Obeids’ involvement in the Bylong Valley. The Commission pointed to an article in the Australian Financial Review, published on 19 December 2009, (the AFR article) and what it described as a pointed question asked in the Legislative Council on 19 May.
	
	
	The Commission found that in early 2010, Mr Duncan initiated the process under which the Obeids’ involvement was terminated. Mr Duncan claimed that he was motivated to act because that was the first time he discovered that the Obeid family were involved with Cascade in the Mt Penny exploration licence. The Commission stated that Mr Duncan’s decision to remove the Obeids was a decision on behalf of Cascade and solely for its benefit. It stated that each of the individual appellants were involved in the transaction, relying on the following evidence from Mr Duncan:
	


“When you discovered it did you have a conversation with your knowledge that they [sic] Obeids were involved in the mining venture with anybody else from Cascade? --- Yes.

With whom? --- Mr McGuigan, Mr Poole and Mr Atkinson.

All at once? --- I’m not sure.

…

THE COMMISSIONER: What generated the heat? --- I felt upset about the matter and I demanded that it get fixed.

What were you upset about? --- I didn’t believe that they were parties we ought to be involved in if we are going to try and develop this as a property and as a major mine and we go out and try and borrow from the banks that the – their reputation with the bankers would not – would make it very difficulty [sic] for us.

…

Did you suggest how it should be fixed? --- I said we have got to get them out of this place.”


	
	The Commission found that it was clear the reason it was necessary to remove the Obeids from the transaction was that their involvement posed a risk to the value of the Mt Penny tenement. It identified two risks. The first, which was described as a small risk, was that the Mt Penny exploration licence might be cancelled and the second was that a mining lease would not be granted. The Commission pointed to the fact that there was an election pending in March 2011 and that there was likely to be a change of government and the incoming government would not view the Obeid family favourably. It was in this context and in the context of questions being asked in parliament that the decision makers at Cascade felt they had to act. The Commission relied in particular on the following evidence:
	


(a)   Mr Duncan

“…What it meant was that if it became public knowledge that the Obeids had historically been involved or were involved that might be a powerful factor against the chances of getting a Mining Lease. Do you agree? --- It was a risk.

And let’s face it if the Exploration Licence was cancelled or if a Mining Lease wasn’t issued the asset was worth nothing. Do you agree? --- It, if there was no lease the money spent on the exploration would have been lost.”

(b)   Mr Atkinson

“Well you just said yourself that the fear was that if the Obeids were involved that the mining licence would never issue to Cascade Coal? --- I think that was the fear, yes.

…

You also believed that if the Obeids were the co-venturer with Cascade Coal that the government would not proceed to issue a mining licence? --- I thought there was a high risk that - - - 

And if the government did not proceed to issue a Mining Licence the value of that tenement would collapse to nothing, correct? --- It’s worthless if the government doesn’t.

…

And why is that because? --- Because I believe it would’ve been very difficult for, I think the risk of a Department, they would’ve, I believe they would’ve judged the mining, granted the mining lease on an objected [sic] basis, but the political nature of it I think would’ve been very hard ultimately for that mining lease to have been granted.”

c)   Mr McGuigan

“I’m not - - -? --- And I, look I think the concern grew as publicity grew, as, so there was certainly a point and in my case, Commissioner, by early 2010 it, it was my strong view that we had a major problem with this particular project if the Obeids continued to retain their equitable interest.”


	
	The Commission rejected submissions that the reason for extracting the Obeid interest from the joint venture was to make it easier to control or value the asset or to present the asset to bankers to obtain financial backing. It stated that if the true reason was basically a financial one, there would be no reason to keep it secret.
	
	
	The Commission found that there were one or two meetings between Messrs Duncan, McGuigan and Poole with Moses Obeid and his solicitor, Mr Chalabian. Thereafter, it found the responsibility for negotiating the removal of the Obeids was given to Mr Poole, who conducted negotiations with Mr Chalabian.
	
	
	The Commission declined to rely upon the evidence of Mr Poole, but placed reliance on the evidence of Mr Chalabian. The latter was described as an important witness because he gave direct evidence of statements made by Mr Poole as to the purpose underlying the termination of the joint venture. It concluded that the evidence of Mr Chalabian was honest and reliable.
	
	
	The Commission concluded that the parties agreed on the price fairly easily. It recorded that the investors in Cascade agreed to pay the Obeid family $60 million in respect of the rights they had in the joint venture. It stated that these rights, on exercise, would have entitled the Obeids to a one quarter share in the joint venture to develop the mine. It stated that this implied that the value of the venture was $240 million.
	
	
	The Commission stated that the means agreed on to terminate the Obeid interest involved the introduction of the two cleanskin companies: Southeast and CMG. The Commission found that CMG was an inactive company, owned by Mr Poole and his family, and as I indicated above at [11], Southeast was incorporated to disguise the Obeid interest.
	
	
	The Commission concluded that the reason for the transaction was to hide the Obeids’ involvement so as to reduce the risk that the government might take action against the Mt Penny exploration licence or not grant the mining licence. In reaching that conclusion, the Commission relied on the following evidence given by Mr Chalabian at his compulsory examination. First, it relied on the evidence as to why it was necessary to use a cleanskin company. That evidence was in the following terms:
	


“That’s why the company, Southeast Investments Group Pty Ltd was incorporated? --- Correct.

It was incorporated for the sole purpose of facilitating disguising the Obeid involvement at Mount Penny? --- Correct.

And to disguise that involvement for fear that it would alert people to the chance that this Exploration Licence had been corruptly obtained? --- It was to disguise the Obeids’ interest.

But that was because of this whiff of corruption which surrounded the whole of the transaction? --- Yeah, that was the concern Poole had, yes.” 


	
	Second, the Commission relied on Mr Chalabian’s evidence of what was said to him by Mr Poole:
	


“He explained to you, didn’t he, that the beneficial ownership of the Obeids had to be disguised? --- That’s correct.

And he explained to you that the beneficial ownership of the Obeids had to be disguised because it would have been unpalatable to investors had they known that the Obeids were involved? --- Correct.

He explained to you that was because there was a fear that there would be an association drawn between the Obeids and corruption? --- That’s an inference he drew but yes, that, that was his - - -

That’s what he said? --- That’s what, that was his view, yes, yes, yes.

And what it was was that there [sic] a fear that people would say that the Exploration Licence had been acquired corruptly and it might be set aside? --- That was their fear.

And he told you that because of that it was important that this interest of the Obeids be disguised, is that so? --- Yes.

…

Was it done with a view to disguising their involvement? --- Yes.

Did you have conversations with Richard Poole on this very subject? --- Yes.

Richard Poole from your dealings with him from the outset – did he know that the Obeid’s were involved? --- Yes.

He mentioned it several times to you, didn’t yes? --- Yes.

THE COMMISSIONER: That’s in the mining[?] --- Yes, yes Commissioner.

The mining aspect of Mount Penny? --- Yes Commissioner.

…

MR WATSON:…What I’m trying to establish here is that throughout your discussions with Richard Poole is this a fair summary – first he knew the Obeids were involved. --- Yes.

This is the mining joint venture of Mount Penny and the extraction. To [sic] – he was the one who was telling you that the Obeids interests had to be carefully disguised. --- Yes.

He told you it had to be carefully disguised because otherwise the government might set aside the exploration license. --- That was his concern Mr Watson.

And he was telling you that because of that you had to go through this kind of elaborate installation of trustees and companies so no one could find the Obeid name? --- Yes.”


	
	In that context, the Commission found that the individual appellants knew full well the transaction with Southeast was a transaction with the Obeid family. It also found that it was carried out with a view to disguising the Obeid involvement from the government and other investigating agencies. Neither of these findings was challenged by the individual appellants with the exception of Mr Atkinson who challenged the second finding.
	
	
	In Chapter 30, the Commission also dealt with the knowledge of Mr Kinghorn. Although that question is not relevant to the proceedings, the Commission there referred to an intercepted telephone conversation of 11 April 2011 concerning an enquiry directed to White Energy by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). The conversation is relevant to Mr Duncan’s appeal and was recorded as follows:
	


“DUNCAN: Right and – and, eh, the – we can’t answer it without disclosing the various steps that, eh, the money went to CMG which is -

KINGHORN: Yeah.

DUNCAN: - which traces back to Richard Poole and his family.

KINGHORN: Right.

DUNCAN: And if anyone goes behind that, it goes back to the guys that dropped out of the tender.

KINGHORN: Are – are they likely to get behind Richard Poole’s?

DUNCAN: Eh, well only if they ask the question and he answers it.

KINGHORN: Yeah, yeah well I guess if they ask him a straight question he’s got to – he’s got – he’s got to give them a straight answer hasn’t he?

DUNCAN: That’s right. Right, now we – we tried all sorts of weasel words and everything else to -

KINGHORN: Trav they – they’re – they’re obviously being – I mean this – this is – this is not a question that’s got anything to do with ASIC whatsoever. It’s got nothing to do with the ASX whatsoever.

DUNCAN: That’s right.

KINGHORN: It’s just – it’s – it’s a – it’s a question that’s been – it’s a – it’s a question that’s been, um, you know, deliberately placed there, eh, eh, by people who are mischievous, yeah.”


	
	In Chapter 31, the Commission found that the investors held the belief that the transaction with White Energy would founder if it emerged the Obeids had been or were involved. It concluded that the transaction ultimately collapsed because it was realised the Obeid involvement was likely to be revealed.
	
	
	The Commission referred to the fact that on 30 November 2010, White Energy announced to the ASX that it had signed an option to acquire two significant coal deposits in NSW. It pointed out that Cascade was owned by a syndicate of investors including entities associated with the current White Energy directors.
	
	
	I referred earlier to the establishment of the IBC. The Commission found that the IBC identified four major issues which had to be resolved. The first was the circumstances in which the Mt Penny exploration licence was granted to Mt Penny Coal. The second was whether or not there was any involvement by the Obeid family in the grant of the Mt Penny exploration licence. The third was whether the Obeids were, or had been, involved in any joint venture to which Cascade was, or had been, a party. The fourth was to work out why Cascade had paid $28 million to CMG. The Commission indicated the sum was part of the $30 million which ended up in the hands of the Obeid family. The Commission referred to the evidence of Mr Cubbin and the solicitor retained by the IBC, Mr Phillip Podzebenko, stating the importance of this issue. The evidence of Mr Cubbin was in the following terms:
	


“Now, this was a critical issue for White Energy as I’ll come to in some documents later but just because you can [sic] an Exploration Licence doesn’t mean you’re going to get a Mining Lease, is that right? --- Absolutely.

And if there was a bit of a stink surrounding the grant of the Exploration Licence your fear, tell me if I’m wrong, your fear was when the government came to grant a Mining Lease they may not grant a Mining Lease at all? --- Absolutely, that was my major concern.

I’m going to come to some documents which suggest that in those circumstances you feared that you could be payment [sic] $500 million for an asset worth nothing? --- Exactly, exactly.”


	
	Whilst Mr Podzebenko expressed his concerns in these terms:
	


“And the concern there was that if it was granted in suspect circumstances it might render the Exploration Licence liable to cancellation by the Government? --- That was one concern although we also were concerned that it would render the Government unwilling to grant other approvals necessary to build a mine and also to allow the licence to lapse without renewal.”


	
	The Commission found that the investors in Cascade were not forthcoming with information concerning the Obeids’ involvement. It accepted Mr Cubbin as a reliable witness. His evidence on this issue was as follows:
	


“At any time did any of these people Atkinson, John McGuigan, Travers Duncan, Brian Flannery, did any of them tell you that there was an Obeid involvement apart from or in addition to the mere ownership of Cherrydale Park? --- To the best of my recollection, no.

Well, let’s put it this way, Mr Cubbin, as head of the Independent Board Committee and given the concerns that you’d had if any of those men had ever told you of an involvement by the Obeid family in the mining venture what would you have done? --- I’d become very worried.

Well, would you - - -? --- But, well, I think the best way to answer that is to say that I think that probably would have been the end of the transaction because you know from a practical viewpoint, if, if I was informed of that to use your words [as] the head of IBC then I would be required to inform Deloittes who are doing the independent assessment of the deal and it would have to go into the notice of meeting to the shareholders and that would have meant a number of things including I think Deloitte would have said that it wasn’t a fair and reasonable deal and I obviously when, when in the notice of meeting the, there would have been a lot of adverse publicity and I think that would have meant the end of the transaction.

Well, just surely as a director of White Energy and in your role as the head of the IBC would you have been recommending that the deal proceed had you known that fact? --- No.”


	
	The Commission referred to the fact that each of Messrs Duncan, McGuigan and Atkinson were directors of White Energy and owed a fiduciary duty to that company. The Commission found that each of them must have been aware that the IBC was interested in the question of any historical involvement of the Obeid family in Mt Penny. The Commission said that they must have been aware that Mr Cubbin and the IBC were trying to ascertain whether there had been any Obeid involvement in the tenement and why Cascade had paid $28 million to CMG. It concluded that each must have understood that this information was vital to White Energy.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Duncan, the Commission found that he was well aware of the importance of this issue. It referred to the following evidence of Mr Duncan:
	


“THE COMMISSIONER: Well did he raise it with you at all? --- I think he did.

What did he say? --- I told him that they weren’t in there, I think I told him that they weren’t in there.

MR WATSON: You told him they weren’t in there? --- I think I told him they weren’t in there.

Well if you did that then you would’ve lied to him? --- Why would I have lied to him?

Well you knew they were? --- I thought you used the tense that they – he raised the question with me that they were in there.

…

THE COMMISSIONER: Well did you notice he was asking you questions about the Obeids involvement? --- I think so.

In the mining aspect? --- I think so.

MR WATSON: Did you tell him that you knew they had been involved? --- No I don’t believe I did, I don’t recall.

Why not? Why wouldn’t you do that? --- Why would I?”


	
	The Commission said this evidence showed that Mr Cubbin was seeking information and assistance from Mr Duncan and Mr Duncan was misleading Mr Cubbin and the IBC for his own financial advantage.
	
	
	The financial advantage that the Commission concluded was brought about by the concealment of the Obeid involvement was that disclosure of the involvement would constitute a risk to the value of the tenement, by virtue of possible government intervention and the failure to grant a mining lease. It concluded that public awareness of that risk would have reduced the value of the Cascade shares held by each of the investors.
	
	
	In relation to Mr McGuigan, the Commission noted that his evidence was that he told Mr Cubbin, in February 2010, that the Obeids were involved in the joint venture. The Commission rejected this evidence in favour of the evidence of Mr Cubbin to the effect that he was unaware of any involvement by the Obeids in the tenement. The Commission also referred to the fact that Mr McGuigan must have known that Mr Cubbin was looking for the information in November 2010, yet did nothing about it. The Commission referred to the following evidence concerning his knowledge that Mr Cubbin was looking for such information in November 2010:
	


“You must have been disappointed that after telling Cubbin this that he did not reveal it, even though it was a matter of primary concern for the independent board? --- I was surprised. I, I, I did not repeat the conversation that I’d had with Mr Cubbin in February, I did not repeat that in November.

…

Did, did that later on become a factor in your mind? --- Well, I, I endeavoured to answer it just now in the way that I did and I believe I said yes, it did become a factor.

MR WATSON: So when it did become a factor what did you then [do] to inform the shareholders of White Energy? --- I, I did nothing.

But you’re under a fiduciary relationship with them weren’t you? --- Well, let, let me - - -

Were you or were you not in a fiduciary relationship with the shareholders of White Energy? --- I obviously was.”


	
	The Commission referred to the evidence of Mr Anthony Levi, the Divisional Director of Corporate Finance at Arthur Phillip Pty Ltd. Mr Levi said that following a conversation with Mr Podzebenko, he was aware that the IBC wanted to know if there was any “Obeid involvement” in the deal. Mr Levi said he sought instructions from Messrs Duncan and McGuigan as to what he should tell Mr Podzebenko and he was told effectively that Mr McGuigan would deal with the matter and that he should not reply to Mr Podzebenko. The Commission said that it interpreted this episode as an occasion when the IBC came close to getting the truth but Messrs Duncan and McGuigan stepped in to prevent the truth from emerging.
	
	
	The Commission concluded that in those circumstances, Mr McGuigan breached his fiduciary obligation to White Energy. The Commission summarised its findings as follows:
	


“The Commission finds that John McGuigan misled Mr Cubbin and the IBC by taking active steps to conceal from them the Obeid involvement in the Mount Penny tenement. The active steps involved preventing Mr Levi from telling Mr Cubbin about the Obeid involvement. This concealment was carried out for John McGuigan’s personal advantage. His personal advantage was, as is the case concerning Mr Duncan, the avoidance of any reduction in the value of his shares in Cascade. That reduction was likely to have resulted had he made full disclosure to Mr Cubbin.

John McGuigan was a director of White Energy and had a fiduciary duty to the company. The Commission is satisfied that, despite this, John McGuigan deliberately concealed the Obeid involvement in the Mount Penny tenement from Mr Cubbin and the IBC.”


	
	So far as Mr Atkinson was concerned, the Commission pointed out that he was a director of White Energy and had been its managing director. The Commission pointed out that he agreed that he knew the IBC was looking for information on a potential Obeid involvement and that the information was important to it. The Commission referred to his evidence that his duty was to protect the interests of Cascade, not the shareholders of White Energy.
	
	
	The Commission concluded that as a director of White Energy, Mr Atkinson owed that company a fiduciary duty. It concluded that Mr Atkinson deliberately concealed the Obeid involvement in the Mt Penny tenement from Mr Cubbin and the IBC.
	
	
	The Commission concluded that its findings were not affected by the guarantees given by the individual appellants to White Energy in respect of the transaction. The Commission observed that the guarantees required investors in Cascade to return their benefits if the asset was adversely affected in the first 12 months after the sale.
	
	
	The Commission noted the submission that this demonstrated that the investors in Cascade had complete faith in the integrity and value of the asset. However, it stated the argument did not address the real issue. It stated it was clear that several of the investors in Cascade had formed the view that the Obeids’ involvement presented a real risk to the value of the asset, but nonetheless were prepared to proceed and disguise the Obeid involvement. It stated that reaching an agreement with White Energy gave them the chance of windfall profit and in a sense they had little to lose by giving the guarantees. It said that the complex arrangements reached with the Obeids gave them some confidence that the Obeid involvement would not emerge.
	
	
	The Commission referred to the fact that Mr Poole was not a director of White Energy. However, it pointed to the fact that a meeting was arranged between Messrs Cubbin and Podzebenko, on behalf of the IBC, and Mr Poole.
	
	
	The Commission referred to evidence that Mr Poole had prepared for the meeting by discussing the relevant issues with Messrs Duncan, McGuigan and Atkinson. At that meeting, it was resolved that the existence of the rights termination deed should not be revealed. The reason, according to Mr Poole, was that the truth might adversely affect the value of the asset. There was no challenge to this finding.
	
	
	The Commission found that on 16 March 2011, Messrs Cubbin and Podzebenko met with Mr Poole. The Commission noted that there were three items on the agenda: the circumstances of the grant of the Mt Penny exploration licence; whether there had been any Obeid involvement in the Mt Penny exploration licence; and the circumstances behind the payment of $28 million by Cascade to CMG. The Commission referred to Mr Poole’s response as recorded in a file note prepared by Mr Podzebenko. In relation to the second item, Mr Poole said he personally had no issue disclosing the nature of the services CMG had provided to Cascade to which the $28 million payment related, but had been asked by other investors not to do so. He said he did not believe there was any political sensitivity in relation to the payment.
	
	
	As regards the third agenda item, Mr Poole told Messrs Cubbin and Podzebenko he was not aware of any payments having been made to Mr Obeid, any Obeid related entities or any other Australian Labour Party politician. He said as far as he was aware, none of the $28 million had been paid to Mr Obeid or Obeid related entities.
	
	
	The Commission found that Mr Poole did not tell Messrs Cubbin or Podzebenko the true facts, but rather, deliberately misled them. The Commission found that Mr Poole feared that if he told Messrs Cubbin and Podzebenko the truth, it was likely the Obeid involvement in the Mt Penny tenement would become public, which would probably have led to a reduction in the value of Cascade shares.
	
	
	On 16 March 2011, the ASX requested a breakdown of $41,761,000 of capitalised mining costs which were disclosed in Cascade’s accounts. A follow up enquiry was made on 1 April 2011.
	
	
	The Commission found that Messrs Cubbin and Podzebenko sought information on this subject from Mr Duncan who deferred a response. There followed the intercepted telephone conversation between Messrs Duncan and Kinghorn to which I have referred above at [82]. The Commission expressed the view that the concern expressed by Messrs Duncan and Kinghorn was that a straightforward answer would enable the ASX to get behind the involvement of Mr Poole. It was in light of that concern that a decision was made to terminate the option agreement.
	
	
	The Commission stated that it found this aspect of the conversation disturbing for three reasons. The first was that it was impossible to know on whose behalf, White Energy or Cascade, the decision was made to terminate the agreement. The second was the fact that directors of a public company had sought to evade an ASX enquiry by the use of “weasel words”. The third was that the fear of exposure of the payment meant the better option was to cancel the transaction. The Commission concluded that this was because the persons involved were so concerned about the need, eventually, to reveal an Obeid involvement that they were not willing to risk providing answers to the ASX.
	
	
	On 12 April 2011, White Energy announced to the ASX that the agreement with Cascade was terminated. The reason given was uncertainty in respect of “hydrology, cultural heritage, transportation, social impact, agricultural land” issues. It stated the IBC had been seeking additional clarity in relation to those matters and negotiating amendments to address these risks in the sale agreement.
	
	
	The ultimate findings by the Commission against each of the individual appellants were in the following terms:
	


“Mr Duncan

The Commission is satisfied that Mr Duncan knew that, if the NSW Government found out that the Obeids had been involved in the creation of the Mount Penny tenement or in the allocation of the Mount Penny exploration licence or had a beneficial interest in the Mount Penny tenement, the NSW Government might take action to set aside the Mount Penny exploration licence or not grant a mining lease in which case the assets of Cascade, of which Mr Duncan was an investor, would be jeopardised. He therefore intended to hide from the NSW Government and relevant public officials the Obeid family involvement. The Commission is satisfied that the steps he took to do this included:

a)   deliberately misleading Mr Cubbin as to the Obeid family involvement in the Mount Penny tenement by failing to disclose the involvement to Mr Cubbin when Mr Cubbin raised the issue with him

b)   deliberately failing to disclose to the IBC the fact of the Obeid family involvement despite knowing that the IBC was concerned with any such involvement

c)   telling Mr Levi that John McGuigan would directly contact Mr Cubbin and thereby relieving Mr Levi from having to answer Mr Cubbin’s request for information about the Obeid family involvement

d)   authorising Mr Poole to arrange for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture through arrangements involving Coal & Minerals Group and Southeast Investments

The Commission is satisfied that a substantial purpose in taking these steps was to prevent public officials and public authorities from learning of the Obeid family involvement in the Mount Penny tenement and that Mr Duncan thereby intended to deceive relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in that tenement.

Mr Duncan’s conduct as set out in a) to d) above with the intention, in each case, of deceiving relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in the Mount Penny tenement, is corrupt conduct for the purpose of s 8(2) of the ICAC Act. This is because his conduct could have adversely affected, either directly or indirectly, the exercise of official functions by any public official or public authority reviewing the creation of the Mount Penny tenement or the grant of exploration licences over the Mount Penny tenement (including the circumstances surrounding the granting of such licences) or the official functions of any public official or public authority considering whether to grant a mining lease over the Mount Penny tenement and could also involve fraud or company violations and therefore comes within s 8(2)(e) and s 8(2)(s) of the ICAC Act.

…

The Commission is satisfied for the purposes of s 9(1)(a) of the ICAC Act that, if the facts it has found relating to the deliberate misleading of Mr Cubbin, were to be proved on admissible evidence to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt and accepted by an appropriate tribunal, they would be grounds on which such a tribunal would find that Mr Duncan committed a criminal offence of obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. The advantage was to prevent the loss in the value of his holding in Cascade should the sale to White Energy not proceed or if the NSW Government found out about the Obeid involvement and took steps to cancel the exploration licence or announced that it would not grant a mining lease.

The Commission is satisfied for the purposes of s 9(1)(a) of the ICAC Act that, if the facts it has found, relating to authorising Mr Poole to arrange for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture so that the NSW Government would not become aware of their involvement in that tenement, were to be proved on admissible evidence to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt and accepted by an appropriate tribunal, they would be grounds on which such a tribunal would find that Mr Duncan committed a criminal offence of obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. The advantage was the removal of the risk to the retention of the exploration licence and the reduction in the risk that a mining licence might not be granted over the Mount Penny tenement.

The Commission is also satisfied for the purposes of s 9(1)(a) of the ICAC Act that, if the facts it has found in relation to deliberately misleading Mr Cubbin, deliberately failing to disclose to the IBC the Obeid family involvement in the Mount Penny tenement and relieving Mr Levi from having to answer Mr Cubbin’s request for information about the Obeid family involvement in that tenement, were to be proved on admissible evidence to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt and accepted by an appropriate tribunal, they would be grounds on which such a tribunal would find that Mr Duncan committed criminal offences under s 184(1) of the Corporations Act 2001. This is because, as a director of White Energy, he was intentionally dishonest or, alternatively, reckless and failed to discharge his duties in good faith and in the best interests of that company or for a proper purpose by withholding information about the Obeid family involvement so that the value of his holding in Cascade Coal would not be adversely affected.

The Commission therefore finds that Mr Duncan engaged in corrupt conduct by:

a)   deliberately misleading Mr Cubbin as to the Obeid family involvement in the Mount Penny tenement by failing to disclose the involvement to Mr Cubbin when Mr Cubbin raised the issue with him,

b)   deliberately failing to disclose to the IBC the fact of the Obeid family involvement despite knowing that the IBC was concerned with any such involvement,

c)   telling Mr Levi that John McGuigan would directly contact Mr Cubbin and thereby relieving Mr Levi from having to answer Mr Cubbin’s request for information about the Obeid family involvement, and

d)   authorising Mr Poole to arrange for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture through arrangements involving Coal & Minerals Group and Southeast Investments,

with the intention, in each case, of deceiving relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in the Mount Penny tenement.

John McGuigan

The Commission is satisfied that John McGuigan knew that, if the NSW Government found out that the Obeids had been involved in the creation of the Mount Penny tenement or in the allocation of the Mount Penny exploration licence or had a beneficial interest in the Mount Penny tenement, the NSW Government might take action to set aside the Mount Penny exploration licence or not grant a mining lease in which case the assets of Cascade, of which John McGuigan was an investor, would be jeopardised. He therefore intended to hide from the NSW Government and relevant public officials the Obeid family involvement. The Commission is satisfied that the steps he took to do this included:

a)    deliberately failing to disclose to the IBC the fact of the Obeid family involvement despite knowing that the IBC was concerned with any such involvement

b)   telling Mr Levi that he (John McGuigan) would directly contact Mr Cubbin and thereby relieving Mr Levi from having to answer Mr Cubbin’s request for information about the Obeid family involvement

c)   authorising Mr Poole to arrange for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture through arrangements involving Coal & Minerals Group and Southeast Investments.

The Commission is satisfied that a substantial purpose in taking these steps was to avoid public officials and public authorities from learning of the Obeid family involvement in the Mount Penny tenement, and that John McGuigan thereby intended to deceive relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in that tenement.

John McGuigan’s conduct as set out in a) to c) above, in each case with the intention of deceiving relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in the Mount Penny tenement, is corrupt conduct for the purpose of s 8 of the ICAC Act. This is because his conduct could have adversely affected, either directly or indirectly, the exercise of official functions by any public official or public authority reviewing the creation of the Mount Penny tenement or the grant of exploration licences over the Mount Penny tenement (including the circumstances surrounding the granting of such licences) or the official functions of any public official or public authority considering whether to grant a mining lease over the Mount Penny tenement and could involve company violations and therefore comes within s 8(2)(s) of the ICAC Act.

The Commission is satisfied for the purposes of s 9(1)(a) of the ICAC Act that, if the facts it has found in relation to the deliberate failure to disclose information to the IBC and relieving Mr Levi from having to answer Mr Cubbin’s request for information about the Obeid family involvement in the Mount Penny tenement were to be proved on admissible evidence to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt and accepted by an appropriate tribunal, they would be grounds on which such a tribunal would find that John McGuigan committed criminal offences under s 184(1) of the Corporations Act 2001. This is because, as a director of White Energy, he was intentionally dishonest or, alternatively, reckless and failed to discharge his duties in good faith and in the best interests of that company or for a proper purpose by withholding information about the Obeid family involvement so that the value of his holding in Cascade would not be adversely affected.

The Commission is also satisfied for the purposes of s 9(1)(a) of the ICAC Act that, if the facts it has found, relating to authorising Mr Poole to arrange for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture so that the NSW Government would not become aware of their involvement in that tenement, were to be proved on admissible evidence to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt and accepted by an appropriate tribunal, they would be grounds on which such a tribunal would find that John McGuigan committed a criminal offence of obtain a financial advantage by deception contrary to s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. The advantage was the removal of the risk to the retention of the exploration licence and the reduction in the risk that a mining licence might not be granted over the Mount Penny tenement.

The Commission therefore finds that John McGuigan engaged in corrupt conduct by:

a)   deliberately failing to disclose to the IBC the fact of the Obeid family involvement despite knowing that the IBC was concerned with any such involvement,

b)   telling Mr Levi that he (John McGuigan) would directly contact Mr Cubbin and thereby relieving Mr Levi from having to answer Mr Cubbin’s request for information about the Obeid family involvement, and

c)   authorising Mr Poole to arrange for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture through arrangements involving Coal & Minerals Group and Southeast Investments,

with the intention, in each case, of deceiving relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in the Mount Penny tenement.

Mr Atkinson

The Commission is satisfied that Mr Atkinson knew that, if the NSW Government found out that the Obeids had been involved in the creation of the Mount Penny tenement or in the allocation of the Mount Penny exploration licence or had a beneficial interest in the Mount Penny tenement, the NSW Government might take action to set aside the Mount Penny exploration licence or not grant a mining lease in which case the assets of Cascade, of which Mr Atkinson was an investor, would be jeopardised. He therefore intended to hide from the NSW Government and relevant public officials the Obeid family involvement. The Commission is satisfied that the steps he took to do this included:

a)   deliberately failing to disclose to the IBC the fact of the Obeid family involvement despite knowing that the IBC was concerned with any such involvement

b)   authorising Mr Poole to arrange for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture through Coal & Minerals Group and Southeast Investments.

The Commission is satisfied that a substantial purpose in taking these steps was to avoid public officials and public authorities from learning of the Obeid family involvement in the Mount Penny tenement and that Mr Atkinson thereby intended to deceive relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in that tenement.

Mr Atkinson’s conduct as set out in a) and b) above with the intention in each case of deceiving relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in the Mount Penny tenement, is corrupt conduct for the purpose of s 8(2) of the ICAC Act. This is because his conduct could have adversely affected, either directly or indirectly, the exercise of official functions by any public official or public authority reviewing the creation of the Mount Penny tenement or the grant of exploration licences over the Mount Penny tenement (including the circumstances surrounding the granting of such licences) or the official functions of any public official or public authority considering whether to grant a mining lease over the Mount Penny tenement and could involve company violations and therefore comes within s 8(2)(s) of the ICAC Act.

The Commission is satisfied for the purposes of s 9(1)(a) of the ICAC Act that, if the facts it has found in relation to the deliberate failure to disclose information to the IBC were to be proved on admissible evidence to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt and accepted by an appropriate tribunal, they would be grounds on which such a tribunal would find that Mr Atkinson committed a criminal offence under s 184(1) of the Corporations Act 2001. This is because, as a director of White Energy, he was intentionally dishonest or, alternatively, reckless and failed to discharge his duties in good faith and in the best interests of that company or for a proper purpose by withholding information about the Obeid family involvement so that the value of his holding in Cascade Coal would not be adversely affected.

The Commission is also satisfied for the purposes of s 9(1)(a) of the ICAC Act that, if the facts it has found, relating to authorising Mr Poole to arrange for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture so that the NSW Government would not become aware of their involvement in that tenement, were to be proved on admissible evidence to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt and accepted by an appropriate tribunal, they would be grounds on which such a tribunal would find that Mr Atkinson committed a criminal offence of obtain a financial advantage by deception contrary to s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900.

The Commission therefore finds that Mr Atkinson engaged in corrupt conduct by:

a)   deliberately failing to disclose to the IBC the fact of the Obeid family involvement despite knowing that the IBC was concerned with any such involvement, and

b)   authorising Mr Poole to arrange for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture through arrangements involving Coal & Minerals Group and Southeast Investments,

with the intention, in each case, of deceiving relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in the Mount Penny tenement.

…

Mr Poole

The Commission is satisfied that Mr Poole knew that, if the NSW Government found out that the Obeids had been involved in the creation of the Mount Penny tenement or in the allocation of the Mount Penny exploration licence or had a beneficial interest in the Mount Penny tenement, the NSW Government might take action to set aside the Mount Penny exploration licence or not grant a mining lease in which case the assets of Cascade, of which Mr Poole was an investor, would be jeopardised. He therefore intended to hide from the NSW Government and relevant public officials the Obeid family involvement. The Commission is satisfied that the steps he took to do this included:

a)   deliberately failing to disclose to the IBC the fact of the Obeid family involvement despite knowing that the IBC was concerned with any such involvement

b)   telling the IBC that he was not aware of any payments having been made to Edward Obeid Sr or any entities associated with him

c)   arranging for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture through arrangements involving Coal & Minerals Group and Southeast Investments.

The Commission is satisfied that a substantial purpose in taking these steps was to avoid public officials and public authorities from learning of the Obeid family involvement in the Mount Penny tenement and that Mr Poole thereby intended to deceive relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in that tenement.

Mr Poole’s conduct as set out in a) to c) above with the intention in each case of deceiving relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in the Mount Penny tenement, is corrupt conduct for the purpose of s 8(2) of the ICAC Act. This is because his conduct could have adversely affected, either directly or indirectly, the exercise of official functions by any public official or public authority reviewing the creation of the Mount Penny tenement or the grant of exploration licences over the Mount Penny tenement (including the circumstances surrounding the granting of such licences) or the official functions of any public official or public authority considering whether to grant a mining lease over the Mount Penny tenement and could involve fraud and therefore comes within s 8(2)(e) of the ICAC Act.

The Commission is satisfied for the purposes of s 9(1)(a) of the ICAC Act that if the facts it has found, in relation to the deliberate failure to disclose information to the IBC and telling the IBC that he was not aware of any payments having been made to Edward Obeid Sr or any entities associated with him, were to be proved on admissible evidence to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt and accepted by an appropriate tribunal, they would be grounds on which such a tribunal would find that Mr Poole committed criminal offences under s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. The advantage, in each case, was to prevent the loss in the value of his holding in Cascade should the sale to White Energy not proceed or if the NSW Government found out about the Obeid involvement and took steps to cancel the exploration licence or announced that it would not grant a mining lease.

The Commission is also satisfied for the purposes of s 9(1)(a) of the ICAC Act that, if the facts it has found, relating to Mr Poole arranging for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture so that the NSW Government would not become aware of their involvement in that tenement, were to be proved on admissible evidence to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt and accepted by an appropriate tribunal, they would be grounds on which such a tribunal would find that Mr Poole committed a criminal offence of obtain a financial advantage by deception contrary to s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. The advantage was the removal of the risk to the retention of the exploration licence and the reduction in the risk that a mining licence might not be granted over the Mount Penny tenement.

The Commission therefore finds that Mr Poole engaged in corrupt conduct by:

a)    deliberately failing to disclose to the IBC the fact of the Obeid family involvement despite knowing that the IBC was concerned with any such involvement,

b)   telling the IBC that he was not aware of any payments having been made to Edward Obeid Sr or any entities associated with him, and

c)   arranging for the Obeids to be extracted from the Mount Penny joint venture through arrangements involving Coal & Minerals Group and Southeast Investments,

with the intention, in each case, of deceiving relevant public officials or public authorities of the NSW Government as to the involvement of the Obeids in the Mount Penny tenement.”


	
	The Commission also found that the ASX release, to which I have referred above at [108], was untrue. It found that this was yet another attempt to prevent knowledge of the Obeid involvement in the granting of the Mt Penny exploration licence and the operation of the joint venture between Cascade and Buffalo escaping into the public domain.
	
	
	As I indicated above at [17], in the third report, the Commission expressed the view that the granting of the authorities for Mt Penny and Glendon Brook was so tainted by corruption that the authorities should be expunged or cancelled and any pending application regarding them should be refused.
	
	
	The Commission recommended legislation to expunge the authorities, which it said would have the benefit of reducing risks arising from challenges in the courts to any ministerial decision to cancel or not renew current authorities. It said a secondary option would be for the minister to consider cancelling the relevant authorities and refusing pending applications for mining leases under s 380A of the Mining Act 1992 (NSW) (Mining Act).
	
	
	The Commission’s reasons, with respect, were sparse and can be set out in full:
	


“In the First Jasper Report, the Commission found that the Mount Penny tenement was created by Mr Macdonald in accordance with a corrupt agreement with Edward Obeid Senior and Moses Obeid. Mr Macdonald did so contrary to his public duty as an officer of the Crown. The decision to create the tenement was not justified by reference to proper planning, mining, environmental, local or economic considerations.

The Commission does not accept that Cascade Coal Pty Ltd has any valid argument capable of justifying the continued existence of the Mount Penny tenement in its present form. As Counsel Assisting submitted:

At the time Cascade Coal Pty Ltd entered into its agreement with Buffalo Resources Pty Ltd, its management knew that the Obeid family was involved in the mining venture and [it] was given and [improperly] used confidential information.

On these grounds, the Commission considers, as Counsel Assisting submitted, ‘the Government [should] take all those measures which are necessary to make certain that the Mount Penny tenement [as presently constituted] is not developed into a mine’.

With regard to the Glendon Brook tenement, Counsel Assisting submitted:

Cascade Coal has acquired the benefit of the Glendon Brook tenement because it entered into the agreement with Monaro Coal, Moses Obeid, Paul Obeid and Gardner Brook in respect of the Mount Penny tenement. That…was a corrupt agreement…[For] the same considerations that would apply in respect of the Mount Penny tenement, it would be inappropriate to permit Cascade Coal to retain the benefits of the Glendon Brook tenement.”

The primary judgment


	
	The primary judge stated that discretionary relief of the type sought by the individual appellants in the court below may be granted where:
	



	
	There is a material error on the face of the record, which includes the reasons given for the decision;
	
	
	The reasoning is not objectively reasonable in the sense that the decision was not one which could have been reached by a reasonable person acquainted with all the facts and having a proper understanding of the statutory function, or was not based on a process of logical reasoning from proven facts or proper inferences from those facts;
	
	
	There is no evidence which could rationally support the impugned findings;
	
	
	Relevant matters have not been taken into account, or irrelevant matters have been taken into account;
	
	
	There has been a material denial of natural justice.
	



	
	The primary judge pointed to the requirement in s 13(3A) of the ICAC Act that it was necessary to be satisfied that an offence of the kind referred to in s 9(1) had been committed as a pre-condition to making a finding of corrupt conduct. He pointed out that if the conclusion of the Commission on that jurisdictional fact was not soundly based, the Court may intervene.
	
	
	The primary judge noted the submission of the individual appellants that s 8(2) required the Commission to identify with precision “the official function” the exercise of which might be adversely affected by the conduct; the “public official” by whom those functions were exercisable; and how it was that the conduct could adversely affect those functions.
	
	
	The primary judge agreed with the submission that neither Mr Cubbin nor the IBC was a public official. He accepted that although official functions are not defined in s 8(2) or otherwise in the ICAC Act, these functions must be functions lawfully exercisable by public officials. He stated that for s 8(2) to be satisfied it must be possible to say the conduct suggested to be corrupt adversely affects, or could adversely affect, the exercise of official functions so understood.
	
	
	The primary judge stated that as a matter of language, conduct could not be characterised as conduct that has, or could have, an adverse effect on the exercise of official functions unless those functions are identifiable with some degree of precision. The primary judge concluded that the word could, where it first appears in s 8(2), is intended to refer to possibility rather than futurity, which, he said, left open the question as to what was the necessary degree of possibility.
	
	
	The primary judge concluded that the first two categories of functions suggested by the Commission as official functions for the purpose of s 8(2), namely reviewing the creation of the tenement and reviewing the grant of the Mt Penny exploration licence, did not have any statutory foundation. The primary judge concluded that, in respect of those functions, the first report did not comply with the requirements of the ICAC Act because it did not identify, in the way that s 8(2) on its proper construction requires, either the official function that could have been affected adversely or the public official by whom that function was exercisable.
	
	
	In relation to what the primary judge described as the third category, official functions relating to the grant of a mining lease, the primary judge noted that it was common ground that a lease could not be granted unless there was in place an appropriate development consent, and the effect of the repealed Pt 3A of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) (EPA Act) was that if the responsible Minister (the Minister) had given approval under that part, a mining lease could not be refused. The primary judge also referred to the fact that in determining whether or not to grant approval, the Minister was required to consider a report that the Director-General of the Department of Planning (the Director-General) was required to prepare.
	
	
	The primary judge pointed to the fact that the Director-General was required by cl 8B of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2000 (EPA Regulation) to consider any aspect of the public interest that the Director-General considers relevant to the project. He also noted that it was not disputed that the Minister would be entitled to take a different view of the public interest to that taken by the Director-General.
	
	
	The primary judge identified the essential controversy between the parties as whether cl 8B of the EPA Regulation extended beyond environmental concerns to more general concerns, including the corrupt process by which the Mt Penny tenement had been created and the circumstances of corruption leading to the grant of the Mt Penny exploration licence.
	
	
	The primary judge rejected the submission that planning law was only concerned with the use of the land itself and that the identity or character of the applicant for a mining lease was irrelevant.
	
	
	In reaching this conclusion, the primary judge accepted that, at a level of basic principle, the focus of planning approval is on the proposed use to be made of the land, rather than the identity or character of the applicant. However, he pointed to the fact that the present issue was not concerned with planning consents in general, but with a process of assessment and approval under Pt 3A of the EPA Act.
	
	
	The primary judge pointed out that once the environmental assessment process mandated by ss 75F and 75H of the EPA Act had taken place, the Director-General was required to report to the Minister, dealing at least with the matters in s 75I(2) of the EPA Act.
	
	
	The primary judge pointed out that in general terms, the matters to which s 75I(2) directed attention were environmental matters. He pointed out that s 75I(2)(f) referred to an environmental assessment undertaken by the Director-General or any other matter the Director-General considers appropriate.
	
	
	The primary judge concluded that whilst it might be thought the words “other matters” ought to be read as limited to environmental aspects of the proposal, cl 8B of the EPA Regulation required the Director-General to consider the four topics stated in it, unless they were included in the report in any event. The matters referred to in cl 8B included any aspect of the public interest the Director-General considered relevant to the project.
	
	
	The primary judge stated that if the concept of public interest was limited to public interest arising out of environmental concerns, it would have been expected to have been canvassed in the process leading up to the Director-General’s report. He concluded that that suggested cl 8B of the EPA Regulation was not referring only to environmental aspects but rather, as it stated, any aspect the Director-General considered relevant.
	
	
	The primary judge essentially rejected the proposition that the legislation required a public official to shut his eyes even to clear evidence of corruption and make his or her decision solely on the basis of environmental considerations. He pointed to the fact that the effect of s 75V of the EPA Act was that, in the circumstances of the present case, approval under s 75J effectively decided any other question that might have arisen under the legislation, including those relevant to the grant of a mining lease.
	
	
	The primary judge drew attention to s 63(2) of the Mining Act, which he said did not limit the matters a decision-maker may take into account in deciding to grant or refuse an application for a mining lease. He noted, however, that it drew attention to circumstances of dishonesty surrounding the application. He pointed out that one of the effects of the mining lease was to give the lessee the right to extract and deal with the mineral wealth of the state, saying that there was a clear public interest in having such grants made by an open and transparent process and not made as a result of, or a consequence of, corrupt dealings.
	
	
	In that context, the primary judge held that the circumstances associated with the grant of the Mt Penny exploration licence were matters which could be taken into account by the Director-General in his report under s 75I of the EPA Act, or by the Minister, in considering whether or not to grant approval under s 75J.
	
	
	The primary judge next dealt with a question of whether, assuming the public interest considerations could extend beyond environmental concerns, it was open to the Commission to conclude that the conduct it found to have occurred could have affected directly or indirectly the exercise of those official functions.
	
	
	In making the submission that the conduct could not have had that effect, the individual appellants relied on the AFR article and the question asked in the Legislative Council in support of the proposition that the Obeid involvement in the Mt Penny tenement was already in the public domain. The primary judge described the AFR article as suggesting, in no uncertain terms that there were, to put it neutrally, suspicious circumstances indicative of collusion between Messrs Macdonald and Obeid relating to the Obeids’ ownership interest in Cherrydale and other nearby properties. The primary judge stated that the question in the Legislative Council raised the issue of dealings between Messrs Macdonald and Obeid in relation to the Mt Penny exploration licence and the preferred tenderer. He noted that Mr Macdonald denied that there were any such discussions between him and Mr Obeid.
	
	
	The individual appellants also challenged the proposition that disclosure to Mr Cubbin or the IBC would have resulted in greater publicity or knowledge of the dealings in question.
	
	
	The primary judge accepted the submission that what Mr Cubbin and the IBC were concerned to know about were the details of the joint venture Cascade had made with the Obeid family and the details of the payments made to CMG.
	
	
	The primary judge concluded that if details of these matters had come into the public domain, both the store of public knowledge and its “explosive quality” would have increased very substantially. He stated that it was open to the Commission to consider that disclosure, to Mr Cubbin or the IBC, of information concerning the Obeids’ involvement in, and extraction from, the joint venture could have adversely affected the exercise of the official function relating to the grant of the mining lease and would likely, if not inevitably, have led to the mining lease not being granted.
	
	
	The primary judge also referred to the evidence of Mr Cubbin, to which I have referred above at [86], as providing strong support for the proposition that revelation of the full truth would have put what was revealed into the public domain. The primary judge stated that this was what the individual appellants feared.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the primary judge held that it was open to the Commission to conclude that the public revelation, and details of those facts, could well have affected the exercise of official functions in relation to the granting of a mining lease.
	
	
	The primary judge rejected the submission that the findings of corruption were based on all the matters set out in the first report and it was not possible to read them distributively, or to separate them. He concluded that the Commission’s disjunctive statement of its conclusions was deliberate and should be read as written. He stated that it was not correct to read the Commission’s findings as saying the individual concerned knew of and failed to disclose to the IBC each of the three elements comprised within the expression “the Obeid family involvement” namely, the involvement in the creation of the tenement, the involvement in the allocation of the Mt Penny exploration licence and the beneficial interest in the Mt Penny tenement. He stated that a reference to a particular appellant’s failure to disclose the Obeid family involvement should be taken as a failure to disclose to the extent the particular appellant had knowledge of one or more of the three separate elements involved.
	
	
	The primary judge also concluded that the Commission posited three categories of official functions namely, reviewing the creation of the tenement, reviewing the grant of exploration licences and considering the grant of a mining lease. He concluded that it was not necessary to find that each of these three official functions existed rather, it was sufficient that at least one could have been adversely affected by the conduct.
	
	
	In dealing with the question of whether the individual appellants’ conduct could constitute a contravention of s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Crimes Act), the primary judge noted that it was not contested that a financial advantage might be obtained by avoiding a financial loss.
	
	
	The primary judge noted that in relation to Mr Duncan, one of the findings made was that he obtained a financial advantage by prevention of “the loss in value of his holding in Cascade should the sale to White Energy not proceed, or if the NSW Government found out about the Obeid involvement and took steps to cancel the exploration licence or announced that it would not grant a mining lease.” In the context of that finding, he noted that it did not matter that ultimately the advantage was not held.
	
	
	However, the primary judge noted that this finding was not expressly made against the other individual appellants, the only express finding made against them being “the removal of the risk to the retention of the exploration licence and the reduction in the risk that a mining lease might not be granted”. He noted that this finding did not in terms characterise the advantage as being the loss in value of the holding in Cascade by removal or reduction of that risk, however, he stated that the crystallisation of the risk would have an obvious financial impact on Cascade because the evidence showed its value would be wiped out, which would be a financial detriment to its shareholders. Thus, he held the financial advantage could be characterised in the same way as it was in respect of Mr Duncan.
	
	
	The primary judge concluded that by concealing the information and seeking through an “absurdly complex scheme” to extricate the Obeid interest, the individual appellants, with the exception of Mr Poole, kept at least on a temporary basis the financial advantage which they had. He stated that the analysis was the same in respect of Mr Poole except that his wife obtained the advantage.
	
	
	The primary judge also rejected the submission that the conduct could not be held to be dishonest. The primary judge stated that even accepting that none of the individual appellants had direct knowledge of the corrupt arrangements between the Obeid family and Mr Macdonald, they knew of the Obeids’ involvement in the joint venture and each of them appreciated that public knowledge of that involvement was likely to imperil his investment. The primary judge found that it was this fear which led the individual appellants to seek to prevent that knowledge becoming public. He concluded it would be open to a jury to conclude that the conduct in those circumstances was dishonest.
	
	
	However, the primary judge declined to hold that there was a contravention of s 184 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act). He stated that fiduciary duties in essence have two components: the first, not to put the interest of the fiduciary in conflict with the interests of the person or entity to whom the fiduciary duty is owed; and second, not to make a profit at the expense of that entity. He accepted there may be some circumstances where, to observe the proscriptive obligations imposed on fiduciaries, it may be necessary for the fiduciary to perform some positive act.
	
	
	However, the judge concluded that in the present case, the individual appellants who were directors of White Energy were not acting in any way as directors of White Energy in relation to the transaction. He said that even if the individual appellants were intentionally dishonest in their dealings with Mr Cubbin and the IBC, that did not occur in the discharge of their duties as a director of White Energy.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the primary judge found that the conclusion of the Commission with respect to s 184(1) of the Corporations Act could not be sustained.
	
	
	The primary judge also noted that the individual appellants submitted that they had been denied natural justice (or procedural fairness) in that they had not been given notice, prior to receiving closing written submissions from counsel assisting the Commission, spelling out the way they were said to have acted corruptly or the nature of the alleged criminality and that they had not been cross-examined on the elements of the offence.
	
	
	The primary judge stated that the correct approach to the question was set out by Wood J in Glynn v Independent Commission Against Corruption (1990) 20 ALD 214 at 218-219. He stated that once the submissions of counsel assisting the Commission were distributed, the individual appellants were in a position to answer them by submissions on the evidence or by making an application to reopen the public hearing. The primary judge pointed out that no such application was made to the Commission and the appellants did not identify any evidence they may have called. The primary judge also stated that although it was not put to any of the individual appellants that they had committed the offences in question, they were cross-examined on the relevant facts that underpinned the Commission’s findings.
	
	
	For these reasons, the primary judge concluded that there had been no denial of procedural fairness.
	
	
	The primary judge also rejected the challenge made by the corporate appellants to the recommendations in the third report. He gave three reasons for such rejection. The first was that there was no decision or finding which was amenable to review. The second was that the challenge of the individual appellants had failed. The third was that any declaratory relief lacked utility.
	


Leave to appeal


	
	Each of the appellants sought leave to appeal. There was no opposition to the grant of leave and it should be granted.
	


The appeal of the individual appellants


	
	Each of the individual appellants filed draft amended Notices of Appeal, which shall be referred to as the Duncan notice, the Atkinson notice and, in the case of Messrs McGuigan and Poole who appeared together, the joint notice. The grounds overlap but in essence they assert that the primary judge made the following errors:
	



	
	The primary judge misconstrued the Commission’s report in three material respects:
	



	
	First, which only related to Messrs McGuigan and Atkinson, the primary judge erred in failing to take into account the absence of any express finding by the Commission that the conduct found against them involved fraud, rather than only company violations. The result was said to be that, having regard to the rejection by the primary judge of the Commission’s conclusion that the conduct involved a contravention of s 184 of the Corporations Act, there was no basis for a finding of corrupt conduct against them: joint notice, Ground 1; Atkinson notice, Ground 9 (the first issue).
	
	
	Second, the primary judge erred in concluding that the Commission’s finding of the existence of three official functions, reviewing the creation of the Mt Penny tenement; reviewing the creation of exploration licences; and considering whether to grant a mining lease over the Mt Penny tenement, ought to be read disjunctively: joint notice, Grounds 4(a) and 5; Atkinson notice, Grounds 4 and 6 (the second issue).
	
	
	Third, the primary judge erred in concluding that the expression used by the Commission “the Obeid family involvement”, which included involvement in the creation of the tenement, involvement in the allocation of the Mt Penny exploration licence and a beneficial interest in the Mt Penny tenement, could be read disjunctively: joint notice, Grounds 4(b) and 6; Atkinson notice, Grounds 5 and 7 (the third issue).
	


In the case of the second and third issue, it was contended the primary judge should have concluded the elements were inseverable.


	
	The primary judge erred in concluding that the Director-General and the Minister were entitled, in considering whether it was in the public interest to approve a development project in respect of Mt Penny under ss 75I and 75J of the EPA Act, to take into account the involvement of Obeid related entities in the Mt Penny tenement or the means by which the Obeid interest was terminated: joint notice, Ground 3; Atkinson notice, Grounds 2 and 3; Duncan notice, Ground 2 (the fourth issue).
	
	
	Assuming the conduct of Obeid related entities in relation to the Mt Penny tenement or the dealings of the individual appellants with the Obeid related entities were matters which the Director-General could take into account in reporting on a development project under s 75I of the EPA Act, or the Minister could take into account in approving a project under s 75J of that Act, the primary judge erred in his conclusion that it was open to the Commission to conclude that the conduct of the individual appellants could have adversely affected, either directly or indirectly, official functions relating to the grant of a mining lease in respect of the Mt Penny tenement: joint notice, Grounds 2 and 7; Atkinson notice, Grounds 1, 8 and 10; Duncan notice, Ground 1 (the fifth issue).
	
	
	The primary judge erred in concluding that it was open to the Commission to be satisfied that the conduct of the individual appellants constituted a contravention of s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act: joint notice, Ground 8; Atkinson notice, Grounds 11 and 12; Duncan notice, Grounds 3 and 4 (the sixth issue).
	
	
	In addition, by Notice of Contention, the Commission contended that the primary judge erred in finding it was not open to it to conclude that the conduct of those individual appellants who were directors of White Energy constituted a contravention of s 184 of the Corporations Act (the seventh issue).
	
	
	The primary judge erred in failing to find that the individual appellants had been denied procedural fairness: joint notice, Ground 9; Atkinson notice, Grounds 13 and 14 (the eighth issue).
	


The statutory requirements for a finding of corrupt conduct


	
	Prior to dealing with the issues raised in the appeal, it is convenient to deal with certain matters of construction of ss 7, 8, 9 and 13(3A) of the ICAC Act which arise in the proceedings.
	
	
	I have set out ss 7 and 8 of the ICAC Act above at [18]. Section 7 defines corrupt conduct by reference to s 8, whilst its ambit is limited by s 9.
	
	
	Of relevance in the present case is s 8(2). As the primary judge correctly pointed out, for there to be corrupt conduct within the meaning of that subsection, it is necessary to identify the official function said to be adversely affected and the public official, group or body of public officials or public authority responsible for carrying out that official function. As I indicated above at [23], the effect of the Validation Act in the present case was to include within the ambit of the subsection conduct which could adversely affect the efficacy of the exercise of official functions by a public official if the other preconditions in ss 8(2) and 9 are made out. As was pointed out in Cunneen at [2], in that context the expression “adversely affects the exercise of an official function” means that the official could exercise the function in a different way or make a different decision from what would otherwise be the case. There was no dispute between the parties that any different decision had to be one which could lawfully be made.
	
	
	Section 8(2) provides that corrupt conduct is conduct that could adversely affect, either directly or indirectly, the exercise of official functions by any public official. The primary judge concluded that the word “could” in that phrase referred to a possibility, although he said the question of the necessary degree of possibility was left open.
	
	
	With respect to his Honour, in my opinion, the word “could” where it first appears in s 8(2) refers to the capacity of the conduct to adversely affect the exercise of the official function. It is not a question of weighing the possibilities. The task of the Commission in making a finding under s 8(2) is to determine whether or not, on the material before it, the conduct had that capacity.
	
	
	The word “could” where it is used the second time in s 8(2) has a similar meaning. However, consideration of whether conduct could involve one or other of the matters referred to in s 8(2)(a)-(y) needs to be undertaken in conjunction with the limitation in s 9(1), which, relevantly for the present case, requires that the conduct could constitute a criminal offence. Thus, in the circumstances of the present case, the question to be answered is whether on the material before the Commission it would be open to a judge or a jury properly instructed to convict the person concerned of an offence involving any of the matters in s 8(2)(a)-(y). I have not dealt with the alternatives in s 9(1)(b), (c) and (d) as they are irrelevant to the present case.
	
	
	That approach to the construction of the section is consistent with what was said by this Court in Greiner v Independent Commission Against Corruption (1992) 28 NSWLR 125 at 136, 186-187.
	
	
	However, it is necessary to consider the introduction of s 13(3A) of the ICAC Act. The section provides that the Commission can only make a finding of corrupt conduct if it is satisfied the person has engaged in, or is engaging in, conduct that constitutes or involves an offence of the kind described in s 9.
	
	
	The section was introduced in 2005 following a report by Mr Bruce McClintock SC. The Second Reading Speech contained the following remarks concerning the introduction of the section:
	


“… The bill inserts section 13(3A) into the Act to require ICAC to be satisfied that a person has engaged in, or is engaging in, conduct that constitutes or involves a criminal offence, disciplinary offence, reasonable grounds for dismissal or a substantial breach of an applicable code of conduct before making a finding of corrupt conduct in relation to conduct referred to in section 9(1).

Proposed section 13(3A) addresses Mr McClintock’s concern that it is inappropriate to base a finding of corrupt conduct on the mere possibility that the relevant conduct has occurred. It is consistent with the ICAC’s approach to making findings of corrupt conduct. Section 13(3A) does not affect the ICAC’s power to make a finding under section 9(5).”


	
	Read literally, the section on one view sits uneasily with s 9(1), which refers to conduct which could constitute a criminal offence and s 74B, which precludes a finding that a person has committed a criminal offence. However, there is nothing in the words of the section to suggest it should be read down. Indeed, to read it down to mean no more than that the Commission was required to be satisfied that it was open to a jury to conclude that an offence had been committed would render the section otiose as that issue is already covered by s 9.
	
	
	It seems to me the section requires, as a necessary precondition to a finding of corrupt conduct, that the Commission is satisfied that the relevant offence has occurred. That does not mean that it is making a finding of criminal guilt or declaring any criminal liability. The section does not require the determination to be made to the criminal standard but requires the Commission itself, as a precondition to jurisdiction at least, to be satisfied the offence has been committed rather than merely that it would be open to a jury to so consider: Australian Communication & Media Authority v Today FM (Sydney) Pty Ltd [2015] HCA 7; 89 ALJR 382 at [44], [79]-[80].
	


The first issue: Did the primary judge err in failing to take into account the absence of any express finding by the Commission that the conduct found against Messrs McGuigan and Atkinson involved fraud rather than only company violations?


	
	The issue does not appear to have been dealt with directly by the primary judge. However, he held that although an express finding of financial advantage made against Mr Duncan was not made against Mr McGuigan or Mr Atkinson, the findings against them could be characterised in the same way: see above at [143]. It seems in those circumstances, the primary judge assumed that the Commission found that the conduct of each of those two appellants involved a contravention of s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act.
	


The submissions


	
	The submissions of Messrs McGuigan and Poole (the joint submissions), which were adopted by Mr Atkinson on this point, pointed out that it was necessary for two questions to be answered affirmatively before conduct could be regarded as corrupt conduct: first, that the conduct could adversely affect the exercise of official functions by a public official and, second, that it could involve one or more of the matters specified in s 8(2)(a)-(y). It was submitted that all that was relied upon by the Commission in respect of Mr McGuigan was company violations under s 8(2)(s), the only company violation identified being a contravention of s 184(1) of the Corporations Act. He submitted that once the primary judge overturned that finding, there was no basis for a finding of corrupt conduct against Mr McGuigan.
	
	
	Mr McGuigan submitted that even if it were possible to treat the findings made by the Commission in relation to s 9(1)(a) of the ICAC Act as satisfying the second requirement of s 8(2), it would not be appropriate to do so because first, the finding that conduct could contravene s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act only related to the finding against Mr McGuigan contained in par (c) of the findings against him (see above at [109]) and second, it was not open to the primary judge or this Court to make findings the Commission did not make. It should be noted that in respect of Mr Atkinson, a finding of a contravention of s 192E(1)(b) was only made in respect of par (b) of the findings against him.
	
	
	The Commission submitted that, as a matter of substance, the Commission had made findings that the conduct of Messrs McGuigan and Atkinson could involve fraud and thus fell within s 8(2)(e) of the ICAC Act. It pointed to the fact that the Commission’s similar findings against Mr Duncan were said to involve conduct falling within s 8(2)(e) of that Act. It submitted the failure to refer to s 8(2)(e) in respect of Messrs McGuigan and Atkinson was an oversight.
	


Disposition


	
	In D’Amore v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2013] NSWCA 187; 303 ALR 342, Beazley P, with whom I agreed, emphasised that the expressed reasons of an administrative decision-maker should make it apparent that the appropriate reasoning process has been undertaken. Her Honour stated this was particularly the case where the process involves a formal public hearing and where the consequences of adverse findings are grave: at [105]. However, in the succeeding paragraph she stated that the reasons of an administrator should not be over-scrutinised to the extent that infelicity of expression is equated with legal inadequacy: at [106].
	
	
	In making that comment, Beazley P referred to Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6; 185 CLR 259. In that case the plurality made the following remarks at 271-272:
	


“When the Full Court referred to ‘beneficial construction’, it sought to adopt an approach mandated by a long series of cases, the best exemplar of which is Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic. In that case, a Full Court of the Federal Court (Neaves, French and Cooper JJ) collected authorities for various propositions as to the practical restraints on judicial review. It was said that a court should not be ‘concerned with looseness in the language … nor with unhappy phrasing’ of the reasons of an administrative decision-maker. The Court continued: ‘The reasons for the decision under review are not to be constructed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error.’

These propositions are well settled. They recognise the reality that the reasons of an administrative decision-maker are meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed.”

See also Kirby J at 291.


	
	Notwithstanding these remarks and however liberally the findings of an administrative body such as the Commission can be read, the Court in reviewing its decision cannot make findings the Commission did not make, irrespective of whether the findings are available on the evidence before it.
	
	
	It is in that context that the findings of the Commission relevant to this ground fall to be considered. The question is whether, on a fair reading of the reasons of the Commission, the primary judge erred in concluding that the Commission found that the conduct in question amounted to a contravention of s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act and was conduct which fell within s 8(2)(e) of the ICAC Act. 
	
	
	The Commission’s conclusion in relation to all the findings made by it against Messrs McGuigan and Atkinson included findings that the identified conduct was undertaken with the intention of deceiving the IBC as to the involvement of the Obeids in the Mt Penny tenement and that they thereby intended to deceive relevant public officials as to that involvement. In respect of the third finding against Mr McGuigan and the second finding against Mr Atkinson, there was a specific finding that that conduct could contravene s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act which is essentially an offence involving fraud.
	
	
	It follows in my opinion that in relation to those particular findings, the Commission did conclude that the conduct fell within s 8(2)(e). The fact that it did not state specifically that it did so does not, in my view, affect the validity of that conclusion.
	
	
	The position is different in respect of the first and second findings against Mr McGuigan and the first finding against Mr Atkinson. In respect of these findings, not only was there no reference to s 8(2)(e) but in contradistinction to the other findings, the Commission stated it was satisfied it involved a contravention of s 184 of the Corporations Act as distinct from s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act. Having regard to the specific nature of the findings, it does not seem to me it is possible to conclude that the Commission did find a contravention of s 192E(1)(b) in respect of those matters. To so conclude would involve the Court making a finding which, on the face of the report, the Commission expressly refrained from making. The Court has no jurisdiction to do so. Indeed to do so would ignore the careful distinction the Commission made in respect of each of the individual appellants as to conduct which contravened s 184 of the Corporations Act and that which contravened s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	Thus, if the primary judge was correct in his conclusion concerning s 184 of the Corporations Act, the first and second findings of corrupt conduct against Mr McGuigan and the first finding against Mr Atkinson must be set aside.
	


The second and third issues: Did the primary judge err in concluding that the Commission’s findings as to the official functions adversely affected and its findings as to the Obeid family involvement could be read disjunctively?


	
	These grounds of appeal were only raised in the joint notice and in the Atkinson notice.
	


The submissions


	
	As I indicated earlier, the Commission’s findings of the Obeid family involvement encompassed three matters: involvement in the creation of the Mt Penny tenement, involvement in the allocation of the Mt Penny exploration licence and the Obeid family’s beneficial interest in the Mt Penny tenement.
	
	
	The joint submissions referred to the repeated use of the expression “the Obeid family involvement” as encompassing all three elements without any relevant distinction. It was submitted that this demonstrated that they were inseverable.
	
	
	In support of this submission, senior counsel for Messrs McGuigan and Poole pointed to the opening paragraph of the findings against Mr McGuigan (see above at [109]) where all three elements of involvement, creation, allocation and beneficial interest, are set out together. He submitted that these three elements were prefaced by words to the effect that Mr McGuigan knew of all three matters.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Messrs McGuigan and Poole then referred to the finding that Mr McGuigan intended to hide the Obeid family involvement, stating that in this formulation there was no specific consideration of any of the three individual elements involved. He continued to point out a number of instances where the generalised reference to the Obeid family involvement was used without any distinction between the three elements and drew particular attention to the finding that Mr McGuigan “failed to discharge his duties … by withholding information about the Obeid family involvement”.
	
	
	In that context, it was pointed out in the joint submissions that the primary judge accepted there was no finding that either Mr McGuigan or Mr Poole had any notice of the corrupt arrangements between Messrs Macdonald and Obeid and that there was no finding of any Obeid involvement in the allocation of the tenement.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Messrs McGuigan and Poole referred to the reliance placed by the primary judge, and the Commission in its submissions, on the word “or” in the opening paragraph of the findings against the individual appellants as supporting the proposition that the three elements should be read disjunctively and applied to the individual appellants to the extent that each of the matters fell within their respective knowledge. He submitted that that did not take account of the way the report was constructed, which involved making individual findings against each appellant but referring in all cases to the three elements without distinction. He submitted it would have been an elementary task to make separate findings on each element against each appellant.
	
	
	Similar submissions were made in respect of the three official functions the Commission found were adversely affected. It was submitted that a composite finding was made and no separate consideration was given to the function of granting a mining lease.
	
	
	It was submitted that in those circumstances, the finding of corrupt conduct could not be sustained.
	


Disposition


	
	In dealing with what I have described as the first issue on the appeal, I have already referred to the manner in which the report should be read.
	
	
	It is important to bear in mind that the report did not only relate to the conduct of the individual appellants but also relevantly to the role of Mr Macdonald and members of the Obeid family.
	
	
	I have summarised the report and there is no suggestion in it of any involvement by Messrs McGuigan, Poole or Atkinson in matters relating to the tenements until the events leading up to the entry into the Heads of Agreement in June 2009: see above at [58]-[60]. In Chapter 27 of the report, the Commission made express findings as to the knowledge of Messrs McGuigan and Poole as at that date: see above at [64]. The Commission then dealt in detail with the steps taken by the individual appellants to remove the Obeids from the joint venture and the failure to disclose their involvement to the IBC.
	
	
	Importantly, the Commission made no finding that Obeid related entities were involved in the initial allocation of the Mt Penny exploration licence to Monaro.
	
	
	Further, in Chapter 33 of the report, the Commission made an express finding of an agreement between Messrs Macdonald, Obeid and Moses Obeid, including that Mr Macdonald acted improperly in his public duty as a Minister by arranging for the creation of the Mt Penny tenement for the benefit of the Obeid family and supplying confidential information in respect of the bid process. The findings are particularised in some detail and there is no suggestion that any of the individual appellants, with the exception of Mr Duncan, were involved. In relation to Mr Duncan there is an express finding that although he requested the bid process be reopened and received confidential information, it did not amount to corrupt conduct.
	
	
	It is in that context that the finding of the Commission against Messrs McGuigan, Poole and Atkinson falls to be considered. The first finding against each of these appellants was that they were aware that if the NSW Government knew that the Obeids had been involved in any of the three ways comprised in “the Obeid family involvement”, the disjunctive element being provided by the use of the word “or” in the opening paragraph, then the exploration licences or potential mining lease would be in jeopardy. That is not a finding which goes to the actual knowledge of any corrupt conduct on behalf of the individual appellants but rather, a statement that the individual appellants knew that if the NSW Government was aware, for example, that the Obeids had a beneficial interest in the Mt Penny tenement, the Mt Penny exploration licence would be in jeopardy. It was a finding that, in my opinion, was open to the Commission to make. It was open for the Commission to infer that Messrs McGuigan and Poole had that knowledge from the relatively secret manner in which the Obeids were bought out of the venture (a transaction in which Messrs McGuigan and Poole, at least, were involved), the conversation between Messrs Chalabian and Poole to which I have referred above at [81], and the evidence of Messrs McGuigan and Atkinson to which I have referred above at [74].
	
	
	Further, in considering the findings of non-disclosure of the Obeid involvement made against each of Messrs McGuigan, Poole and Atkinson, any non-disclosure would be limited to the actual knowledge of those involved as found by the Commission. There is no reason to read the report as finding that Messrs McGuigan, Poole or Atkinson concealed from the IBC matters which were not within their respective knowledge, particularly where the Commission had given detailed consideration to the actual knowledge of the Obeid involvement held by each of the individual appellants.
	
	
	The same conclusion can be reached in relation to the official functions. The findings are expressed as alternatives. The fact that only one of the three alternative official functions was in fact an official function does not, in my view, vitiate the finding so far as that particular function is concerned.
	
	
	In those circumstances, these grounds of appeal are not made out.
	


The fourth issue: Did the primary judge err in concluding that the Director-General or the Minister were entitled to take into account the involvement of Obeid related entities in the Mt Penny tenement and the means by which that involvement was terminated in considering whether it was in the public interest to approve a development project in respect of Mt Penny under Pt 3A of the EPA Act?

The legislation


	
	Part 3A of the EPA Act was inserted into the Act in 2005 to deal with what were described as major infrastructure projects. Section 75B of the EPA Act set out the scope of its operation. The section, so far as is relevant, provided as follows:
	


“75B   Projects to which Part applies

(1)   General

This Part applies to the carrying out of development that is declared under this section to be a project to which this Part applies:

(a)   by a State environmental planning policy, or

(b)   by order of the Minister published in the Gazette (including by an order that amends such a policy).

The carrying out of particular or a class of development, or development for a program or plan of works or activities, may be so declared.

(2)   Kinds of projects

The following kind of development may be declared to be a project to which this Part applies:

(a)   major infrastructure or other development that, in the opinion of the Minister, is of State or regional environmental planning significance,

(b)   major infrastructure or other development that is an activity for which the proponent is also the determining authority (within the meaning of Part 5) and that, in the opinion of the proponent, would (but for this Part) require an environmental impact statement to be obtained under that Part.”


	
	It is common ground that the development of the Mt Penny tenement into a coalmine was brought within the ambit of Pt 3A by Sch 1 of the State Environmental Planning Policy (Major Development) 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	Section 75H provided for the proponent of such a project to submit to the Director-General an environmental assessment of the project. The section provided as follows:
	


“75H   Environmental assessment and public consultation

(1)   The proponent is to submit to the Director-General the environmental assessment required under this Division for approval to carry out the project.

(2)   If the Director-General considers that the environmental assessment does not adequately address the environmental assessment requirements, the Director-General may require the proponent to submit a revised environmental assessment to address the matters notified to the proponent.

(3)   After the environmental assessment has been accepted by the Director-General, the Director-General must, in accordance with any guidelines published by the Minister in the Gazette, make the environmental assessment publicly available for at least 30 days.

(4)   During that period, any person (including a public authority) may make a written submission to the Director-General concerning the matter.

(5)   The Director-General is to provide copies of submissions received by the Director-General or a report of the issues raised in those submissions to:

(a)   the proponent, and

(b)   if the project will require an environment protection licence under Chapter 3 of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 – the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water, and

(c)   any other public authority the Director-General considers appropriate.

(6)   The Director-General may require the proponent to submit to the Director-General:

(a)   a response to the issues raised in those submissions, and

(b)   a preferred project report that outlines any proposed changes to the project to minimise its environmental impact, and

(c)   any revised statement of commitments.

(7)   If the Director-General considers that significant changes are proposed to the nature of the project, the Director-General may require the proponent to make the preferred project report available to the public.”


	
	Section 75I required the Director-General to give a report on the project to the Minister for the purpose of him or her considering whether to approve it. It was in the following terms:
	


“75I   Director-General’s environmental assessment report

(1)   The Director-General is to give a report on a project to the Minister for the purposes of the Minister’s consideration of the application for approval to carry out the project.

(2)   The Director-General’s report is to include:

(a)   a copy of the proponent’s environmental assessment and any preferred project report, and

(b)   any advice provided by public authorities on the project, and

(c)   a copy of any report of the Planning Assessment Commission in respect of the project, and

(d)   a copy of or reference to the provisions of any State Environmental Planning Policy that substantially govern the carrying out of the project, and

(e)   except in the case of a critical infrastructure project – a copy of or reference to the provisions of any environmental planning instrument that would (but for this Part) substantially govern the carrying out of the project and that have been taken into consideration in the environmental assessment of the project under this Division, and

(f)   any environmental assessment undertaken by the Director-General or other matter the Director-General considers appropriate, and

(g)   a statement relating to compliance with the environmental assessment requirements under this Division with respect to the project.”


	
	Section 75J provided for ministerial approval of the carrying out of the project, relevantly, it provided as follows:
	


“75J   Giving of approval by Minister to carry out project

(1)   If:

(a)   the proponent makes an application for the approval of the Minister under this Part to carry out a project, and

(b)   The Director-General has given his or her report on the project to the Minister,

the Minister may approve or disapprove of the carrying out of the project.

(2)   The Minister, when deciding whether or not to approve the carrying out of a project, is to consider:

(a)   the Director-General’s report on the project and the reports, advice and recommendations (and the statement relating to compliance with environmental assessment requirements) contained in the report, and

(b)   if the proponent is a public authority – any advice provided by the Minister having portfolio responsibility for the proponent, and

(c)   any findings or recommendations of the Planning Assessment Commission following a review in respect of the project.”


	
	Section 75V provided that particular authorisations could not be refused if they were necessary to carry out an approved project. Section 75V(1)(c) provided that one such authorisation was a mining lease under the Mining Act. It should be noted that this section did not apply to an application for a renewal of an authorisation: s 75V(3)(a).
	
	
	Section 75Z contained a power to make regulations for the purpose of the Act. Of relevance is cl 8B of the EPA Regulation which was in the following terms:
	


“8B   Matters for environmental assessment and Ministerial consideration

The Director-General’s report under section 75I of the Act in relation to a project is to include the following matters (to the extent that those matters are not otherwise included in that report in accordance with the requirements of that section):

(a)   an assessment of the environmental impact of the project,

(b)   any aspect of the public interest that the Director-General considers relevant to the project,

(c)   the suitability of the site for the project,

(d)   copies of submissions received by the Director-General in connection with public consultation under section 75H or a summary of the issues raised in those submissions.

Note. Section 75J(2) of the Act requires the Minister to consider the Director-General’s report (and the reports, advice and recommendations contained in it) when deciding whether or not to approve the carrying out of a project.”


	
	It is also necessary in considering this issue to have regard to the provisions of the Mining Act. Section 13 deals with applications for an exploration licence. At the relevant time, it provided as follows:
	


“13   Application for exploration licence

(1)   Any person may apply for an exploration licence.

(2)   To avoid doubt, the owner of privately owned minerals may apply for an exploration (mineral owner) licence or any other exploration licence with respect to those minerals.

Note. The owner of privately owned minerals may choose to apply for an ordinary exploration licence with respect to those minerals, rather than an exploration (mineral owner) licence. In relation to exploration (mineral owner) licences see section 24(4).

(3)   An application that relates to land in a mineral allocation area may not be made, except with the Minister’s consent, in relation to any group of minerals that includes an allocated mineral.

(4)   An application for an exploration licence must:

(a)   specify the group or groups of minerals in respect of which the application is made, and

(b)   be lodged with the Director-General, and

(c)   be accompanied by the required information and the application fee prescribed by the regulations, and

(d)   if the application is for an exploration (mineral owner) licence with respect to privately owned minerals that have more than one owner, be made by all the owners.

(5)   The required information is as follows:

(a)   a description, prepared in the approved manner, of the proposed exploration area,

(b)   particulars of the financial resources and relevant technical advice available to the applicant,

(c)   particulars of the program of work proposed to be carried out by the applicant in the proposed exploration area,

(d)   particulars of the estimated amount of money that the applicant proposes to spend on prospecting in that area,

(e)   if the application is for an exploration (mineral owner) licence, evidence that the minerals to which the application relates are owned by the applicant,

(f)   any other information that is prescribed by the regulations.

(6)   If there is more than one applicant for the licence, a reference in subsection (5) to the applicant is a reference to each applicant.”


	
	Section 51 deals with applications for a mining lease. It was in the following terms:
	


“51   Application for mining lease

(1)   Any person may apply for a mining lease.

(2)   To avoid doubt, the owner of privately owned minerals may apply for a mining (mineral owner) lease or any other mining lease with respect to those minerals.

Note. The owner of privately owned minerals may choose to apply for an ordinary mining lease with respect to those minerals, rather than a mining (mineral owner) lease. In relation to mining (mineral owner) leases see section 68(4).

(3)   An application that relates to land in a mineral allocation area may not be made in relation to an allocated mineral except:

(a)   by the holder of an exploration licence or assessment lease over that land in respect of that mineral, or

(b)   with the Minister’s consent.

(4)   An application for a mining lease must:

(a)   specify the mineral or minerals, or the mining purpose or mining purposes, in respect of which the application is made, and

(b)   be lodged with the Director-General, and

(c)   be accompanied by the required information and the application fee prescribed by the regulations, and

(d)   if the application is for a mining (mineral owner) lease with respect to privately owned minerals that have more than one owner, be made by all the owners.

(5)   The required information is as follows:

(a)   a description, prepared in the approved manner, of the proposed mining area,

(b)   an assessment of the mineral bearing capacity of land in that area and of the extent of any mineral deposits in that land,

(c)   particulars of the financial resources and technical advice available to the applicant,

(d)   particulars of the program of work proposed to be carried out by the applicant in the proposed mining area,

(e)   if the application is for a mining (mineral owner) lease, evidence that the minerals to which the application relates are owned by the applicant,

(f)   any other information that is prescribed by the regulations.

(6)   If there is more than one applicant for the lease, a reference in subsection (5) to the applicant is a reference to each applicant.”


	
	Section 63 deals with the power of the decision-maker in relation to applications. Relevantly, it was in the following terms:
	


“63   Power of decision-maker in relation to applications

(1)   After considering an application for a mining lease, the decision-maker:

(a)   may grant to the applicant a mining lease over all or part of the land over which a lease was sought, or

(b)   may refuse the application.

(2)   Without limiting the generality of subsection (1) or any other provision of this Act, an application may be refused on any one or more of the following grounds:

(a)   that the applicant (or, in the case of an applicant that is a corporation, a director of the corporation) has contravened this Act or the regulations (whether or not the person has been prosecuted or convicted of any offence arising from the contravention) or has been convicted of any other offence relating to mining or minerals,

(b)   that the decision-maker reasonably considers that the applicant provided false or misleading information in or in connection with the application or any report provided under this Act for or with respect to the lease.”


	
	Section 65 provides that the Minister must not grant a mining lease unless an appropriate development consent is in force in respect of the land in question. It was common ground that such consent was required to be given under Pt 3A of the EPA Act and that once such approval was given, there was no power to refuse a mining lease.
	


The submissions


	
	The joint submissions on this ground were adopted by Mr Atkinson in his submissions. Mr Duncan relied on separate submissions which were essentially to the same effect.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Messrs McGuigan and Poole identified the central controversy as being whether the public interest for the purpose of cl 8B of the EPA Regulation extended beyond environmental concerns to include general concerns such as the matters identified by the Commission. He submitted that, insofar as these findings related to corrupt dealings in the grant of the Mt Penny exploration licence, there was no necessary connection between an application for the grant of a mining lease and the holder of an exploration licence as s 55 of the Mining Act did not require an applicant for a mining lease to be the holder of an exploration licence over the tenement in question.
	
	
	In the joint submissions, Messrs McGuigan and Poole submitted that, in that context, the primary judge erred in relying on s 63(2) of the Mining Act in light of the clear terms of s 75V(2) of the EPA Act. The joint submissions also referred to the limited class of matters referred to in s 63(2) of the Mining Act, namely, either a contravention of that Act (s 63(2)(a)) or what senior counsel for Messrs McGuigan and Poole described as a specific and limited species of dishonest conduct (s 63(2)(b)). They submitted that it was not capable to draw from this provision an inference that the matters found by the Commission could be taken into account in considering whether or not to grant development approval.
	
	
	In relation to cl 8B of the Regulation, senior counsel for Messrs McGuigan and Poole accepted that the report of the Director-General could deal with aspects of the public interest which had not been dealt with by the earlier processes, but submitted that that did not mean that the public interest to be considered went beyond planning and environmental matters.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Messrs McGuigan and Poole also submitted that the meaning and effect of the expression “public interest” is derived by reference to the subject matter, scope and purpose of the statute, but did not extend to matters extraneous to any object the legislation had in view.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Messrs McGuigan and Poole also submitted that the conclusion of the primary judge on this issue seemed to be based on the assumption that the ability to take the matters in question into account was desirable. He submitted that it was a long bow to draw to reach that conclusion based on the EPA Regulation, in circumstances where neither the EPA Regulation itself, nor the EPA Act, made any such suggestion. He submitted that cl 8B of the EPA Regulation is to be found in the context of legislation which is essentially impersonal and not concerned with the identity of the applicant but rather the land itself and its use, with any approval enuring for the benefit of subsequent landholders and occupiers.
	
	
	In the joint submissions, Messrs McGuigan and Poole submitted that the various provisions in Div 2 of Pt 3A of the EPA Act reinforced the proposition that the public interest for the purpose of cl 8B of the EPA Regulation was confined to environmental matters. They pointed to the fact that s 75H was directed to an environmental assessment, whilst the other matters referred to in that section and s 75I were also directed to environmental matters. Senior counsel for Messrs McGuigan and Poole submitted that if the criminality or possible criminality of an applicant was a relevant matter to be taken into account, it would have been expected that the legislation would state so.
	
	
	In his written submissions, Mr Duncan referred to the fact that s 5 of the EPA Act included amongst its objects the promotion and co-ordination of the orderly and economic development of the land, but submitted that there was nothing to suggest that either the Director-General or the Minister were empowered under Pt 3A to review or even second-guess decisions by other authorities pursuant to other legislation. He submitted that if that proposition was correct, the circumstances in which the tenement was created, or the Mt Penny exploration licence granted, was a matter extraneous to their decision.
	
	
	The Commission submitted that the general principle that planning law is concerned with the use of the land as opposed to the identity of the users does not determine the scope of permissible considerations under Pt 3A. It submitted that the applicant’s proposition depended upon public interest in Pt 3A being construed narrowly such that the Minister and the Director-General were precluded from taking into account the circumstances of the creation of the tenement and the removal of the Obeid interest. It submitted there was nothing in the scope or purpose of the Act to require it to be so constrained.
	
	
	The Commission submitted that the language of cl 8B of the EPA Regulation and the structure of the Act indicated that the Director-General and the Minister were not confined to aspects of the public interest that involved environmental assessments. It also submitted, referring to Minister for Planning v Walker (2008) 161 LGERA 253 at [39], that irrespective of the content of the report, it is implicit in the statutory scheme that the Minister’s decision whether or not to grant approval depends on a consideration of the public interest and that this requirement operates at a higher level of generality.
	
	
	The Commission submitted that the breadth of the concept of public interest is reinforced by the special character of Pt 3A approval, which effectively trumps the operation of various other Acts by virtue of s 75V of the EPA Act. It submitted that in exercising his powers under s 75J, the Minister would be entitled to consider matters ordinarily relevant in granting a mining lease. Having regard to the broad scope of s 63 of the Mining Act, the Commission argued that it could hardly be suggested that the Minister could not have regard to corruption in the process which led to the creation of the tenement and to the grant of the Mt Penny exploration licence.
	
	
	The Commission submitted that when faced with a discretionary question of whether or not it was in the public interest to approve the project, the Minister could take into account the fact that the application involved the exploitation of a tenement that existed as a result of a corrupt process. It submitted that the contention that this could not be taken into account was not only surprising but absurd and that this conclusion was supported by an examination of the objects of the legislation set out in s 5 of the EPA Act.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Commission emphasised that the Minister was not obliged to grant project approval even if recommended by the Director-General. He submitted that to suggest that the Minister, in considering the public interest, could only take into account the mandatory considerations that the Director-General’s report was required to consider under cl 8B of the EPA Regulation was not something required by the Act. He submitted that if the matter in question could rationally be engaged in considering the public interest, then the Minister is entitled to take it into account.
	
	
	The Commission submitted that the primary judge did not rely on s 63(2) in reaching his conclusion, but rather, found it confirmatory of the conclusion he reached. In any event, it submitted that the primary judge’s reliance on s 63(2) was not misplaced. It submitted the primary judge was correct in concluding that the reference to particular forms of dishonesty in s 63(2) counted against the submission that the Minister should be precluded from having regard to a particular form of dishonesty, namely corrupt conduct of the nature found by the Commission, in considering whether the grant of the mining lease was against the public interest.
	
	
	The Commission referred to cl 2A in Sch 6A of the EPA Act which, it submitted, confirmed that even if the Director-General’s report did not deal with the public interest under cl 8B(b), the Minister was authorised to take the public interest into account in deciding whether or not to approve a project under Pt 3A. Clause 2A of Sch 6A was inserted into the Act as part of transitional arrangements consequent upon the repeal of Pt 3A. It commenced operation in May 2014.
	
	
	In the joint submissions, Messrs McGuigan and Poole submitted that even if in form cl 2A of Sch 6A purported to have a retrospective operation, a finding of corrupt conduct could not be maintained by reference to a legislative provision which was not in existence at the time of the conduct. They submitted the clause did not extend or otherwise define what constitutes the public interest. They also submitted that, in amending the legislation, the legislature sought to amend a perceived deficiency, namely that the identity of the applicant for approval was not a matter which could be taken into account. They submitted this tended to support the construction of the legislation for which they contended, as it stood at the relevant time
	
	
	Messrs McGuigan and Poole also submitted that the primary judge erred by considering the ambit of the public interest by reference to what the Commission found concerning the Obeid involvement, rather than by reference to the actual knowledge of the appellants. It is convenient to address this matter in dealing with the fifth issue.
	


Disposition


	
	It is important to bear in mind that the question raised by this ground is not a question of whether the decision-maker must take conduct of the nature of that found by the Commission into account in determining whether to approve the development application, but rather, whether he or she was entitled to do so: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40; 162 CLR 24 (Peko-Wallsend) at 39-40.
	
	
	It also must be borne in mind that the approval of a development project in the present case carried with it the grant of a mining lease. When the ongoing relationship and obligations imposed under such a lease, entered into in accordance with s 72 of the Mining Act and Pt 5 Div 4 of that Act, are considered, it is apparent that approval did not amount merely to the approval of a development project.
	
	
	It is convenient to deal with the issue first by reference to the requirement in cl 8B of the EPA Regulation that the Director-General report on any aspect of the public interest he or she considers relevant to the project. In O’Sullivan v Farrer [1989] HCA 61; 168 CLR 210 at 216, the plurality pointed out that the expression “the public interest”, when used in a statute, imports a value judgment to be made by reference to undefined factual matters confined only “in so far as the subject matter and the scope and purpose of the statutory enactments may enable … given reasons to be [pronounced] definitely extraneous to any objects the legislature could have had in view”: citing Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission (NSW) v Browning [1947] HCA 21; 74 CLR 492 at 506; see also Pilbara Infrastructure Pty Ltd v Australian Competition Tribunal [2012] HCA 36; 246 CLR 379 at [42].
	
	
	It is correct that planning approvals generally are concerned with the use of the land as distinct from the identity of the applicant for approval. In Eaton & Sons v Warringah Shire Council [1972] HCA 33; 129 CLR 270, Stephen J said a consent is essentially impersonal in the sense it is not limited to the applicant but is a consent to the world at large and thus essentially impersonal: at 293; see also House of Peace Pty Ltd v Bankstown City Council [2000] NSWCA 44; 48 NSWLR 498 (House of Peace) at [22]-[24]; Jonah Pty Ltd v Pittwater Council [2006] NSWLEC 99; 144 LGERA 408 at [19]-[20] and Kouflidis and Jenquin Pty Ltd v Corporation of the City of Salisbury (1982) 29 SASR 321 at 323-324. In the latter two cases, the Court held that prior unlawful use of the land was not a relevant factor to be taken into account in considering whether to grant a development application.
	
	
	In Minister for Planning v Walker [2008] NSWCA 224; 161 LGERA 423, this Court considered the validity of an approval under Pt 3A of the EPA Act. Hodgson JA, with whom Campbell and Bell JJA agreed, said that it was a condition of validity of the approval that the Minister consider the public interest. He made the following remarks at [39]-[41]:
	


“[39]   In my opinion, it is a condition of validity that the Minister consider the public interest. Although that requirement is not explicitly stated in the EPA Act, it is so central to the task of a Minister fulfilling functions under a statute like the EPA Act that, in my opinion, it goes without saying. Any attempt to exercise powers in which a Minister did not have regard to the public interest could not, in my opinion, be a bona fide attempt to exercise his or her powers, and so would not even pass the Hickman test.

[40]   There is some confirmation of this from Regulation 8B; and also from s 79C of the EPA Act, dealing with development consents by consent authorities, which specifies the public interest as a factor to be taken into account. Similarly, the Land and Environment Court, dealing with appeals under s 75L and s 75Q of the EPA Act, is required to have regard to the public interest: Land and Environment Court Act 1979 (NSW), s 39(5).

[41]   However, this requirement, so stated, operates at a very high level of generality, and does not of itself require that regard be had to any particular aspect of the public interest: cf Walsh v Parramatta Council [2007] NSWLEC 255 at [60] … One would generally presume that a Minister making a decision does have regard to the public interest, and one would look for substantial evidence to make out a case that the Minister had not had regard to the public interest.”


	
	In dealing first with cl 8B of the EPA Regulation, the authorities to which I have referred do provide support for the proposition that the identity of the applicant and his or her past conduct is irrelevant to consideration of an approval under Pt 3A of the EPA Act. However, this does not take into account the fact that the approval in the present case effectively carries with it the grant of a mining lease. Such a lease will carry with it ongoing obligations on the lessee. Further, it is only transferrable with the consent of the relevant decision-maker: Mining Act, s 121. Thus, unlike a development consent simpliciter, it cannot be said that a mining lease is not personal to the applicant: cf House of Peace at [23].
	
	
	In that context, I am of the view that the Director-General would be entitled, in considering the public interest, pursuant to cl 8B to take into account the circumstances in which the Mt Penny exploration licence was acquired and the dealings which led up to the application for a development consent, carrying with it the grant of a mining lease. Even if that is incorrect and the Director-General was limited to a consideration of strictly environmental matters, the Minister, in my opinion, could take the other matters into account in considering whether the mining lease should be granted. The Minister’s discretion, in my opinion, is only limited by the scope and purpose of the statutory enactment in question: see the cases cited above at [226]. As was pointed out in Warkworth Mining Ltd v Bulga Milbrodale Progress Association Inc [2014] NSWCA 105; 86 NSWLR 527 at [299], the range of matters relevant to the public interest is very wide. The objects of the EPA Act are stated to include the proper development of natural and artificial resources for the purpose of promoting the social and economic welfare of the community (s 5(a)(i)) and the promotion and co-ordination of the orderly and economic use and development of land (s 5(a)(ii)). It seems to me that having regard to these objects, it would be appropriate for the Minister, in considering the public interest, to take into account the fact that the steps leading up to the application for development consent and the associated grant of a mining lease were tainted by corrupt conduct, something hardly consistent with the orderly economic use and development of the land.
	
	
	The appellants contended that the primary judge erred in what was described as his reliance on the Mining Act. However, the fact that approval under Pt 3A of the EPA Act led without more to the grant of a mining lease, does not mean that the Minister in granting approval under Pt 3A cannot take into account public interest considerations which would be relevant if approval was sought under s 63 of the Mining Act. To the contrary, having regard to the effect of the approval under Pt 3A, such considerations would seem to me to be directly relevant.
	
	
	If approval was required under the Mining Act, s 63(2) of that Act specifies particular criminality or misconduct which may be taken into account in refusing to grant a mining lease. The provision was expressly stated not to limit the generality of the discretion conferred on the decision-maker by s 63(1) of that Act. It seems to me that the decision-maker, in those circumstances, would be entitled to take into account other forms of criminality or misconduct which he or she considered led to the conclusion that the grant of the lease was against the public interest.
	
	
	The appellants also contended that the circumstances surrounding the grant of the Mt Penny exploration licence were irrelevant. Messrs McGuigan and Poole pointed to the fact that it was not a prerequisite to the grant of a mining lease that the applicant for such a lease hold an exploration licence and Mr Duncan submitted it was not within the power of the Minister or Director-General to second-guess the decision of other authorities. Both these matters may be accepted. However, that does not mean that it would not be open to the Minister to take into account the circumstances in which an exploration licence was granted in considering whether it was in the public interest to approve a development application which would result in the grant of a mining lease over the tenement in question to the holder of that licence.
	
	
	The appellants also criticised the approach of the primary judge, submitting that he concluded that it was desirable for the matters raised by the Commission to be taken into account in considering the public interest rather than determining whether those matters fell within the public interest having regard to the scope and purpose of the statute. I agree that even if it seems desirable that a particular matter be considered, that matter cannot be taken into account if it is extraneous to the approval contemplated by the statute. However, for the reasons which I have given, I do not think that conduct of the nature complained of falls within that category.
	
	
	It follows that the primary judge did not err in concluding that the findings by the Commission could be taken into account in considering whether it was in the public interest to grant a mining lease.
	
	
	In reaching this conclusion, I have not found it necessary to deal with the effect of cl 2A of Sch 6A of the EPA Act. However, contrary to the appellants’ submissions, I do not think the insertion leads to the conclusion that it sought to remedy a perceived deficiency in the Act, as distinct from clarifying what always was the position: Allina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 203 at 212.
	


The fifth issue: Did the primary judge err in concluding that the conduct of the individual appellants in failing to disclose the involvement of Obeid related entities in the Mt Penny tenement could have adversely affected official functions relating to the grant of a mining lease in respect of that tenement.


	
	There are essentially three questions involved in this issue. First, did the Commission and the primary judge err in proceeding on the assumption that the relevant disclosure comprised all matters surrounding the involvement of Obeid related entities in the tenement, rather than the involvement of Obeid related entities to the extent it was known to the individual appellants. Second, having regard to what was already in the public domain concerning the Obeid involvement, would the conduct concerned, namely the relevant non-disclosure, have the capacity to affect the exercise of official functions in relation to the grant of a mining lease over the tenement and third, where it was contended that disclosure was only required to be made to the IBC, could that disclosure indirectly affect the official functions in respect of the grant of a mining lease for the land.
	


The submissions


	
	In the joint submissions, it was contended that the primary judge erred in treating the individual appellants as knowing what the Commission found regarding the involvement of Mr Obeid and Obeid related entities. The joint submissions pointed to the fact that there was no finding that Mr McGuigan or Mr Poole had any knowledge of the involvement of Obeid related entities in the creation of the tenement or of the deliberations which resulted in the tenement being granted to Cascade. It was submitted that all that could be inferred from the knowledge of Messrs McGuigan and Poole was that the Obeid family had some involvement in the tenement and that the public might think the Obeids played some part, perhaps improperly, in the creation of the tenement. It submitted that a public official could not reject an application for a mining lease on that basis. It was submitted by senior counsel for Messrs McGuigan and Poole that in those circumstances, the conduct could not adversely affect the exercise of official functions in the grant of a mining lease.
	
	
	In dealing with the transactions between Mr Obeid, his associates and Cascade, senior counsel for Messrs McGuigan and Poole submitted that the only information his clients had concerning the Obeid involvement was that Cascade had come second in the evaluation rankings. He described the land agreement between Cascade and the owners of Cherrydale, Donola and Coggan Creek (see above at [7]) as a not unusual transaction between a prospective miner and a landholder and submitted it was difficult to see why simply granting an interest in a prospective venture consequent upon the approval of exploration licences could amount to corrupt conduct.
	
	
	In relation to what I have described as the third question arising under this issue, the joint submissions pointed out that the conduct the primary judge found was capable of amounting to corrupt conduct was the failure to disclose the “Obeid involvement” to the IBC and the conduct in arranging for the extraction of the Obeids from the Mt Penny joint venture.
	
	
	The joint submissions pointed out that the primary judge failed to answer the question of the necessary degree of probability or possibility imposed by the use of the word “could” where it is first used in s 8(2) of the ICAC Act. It was submitted that, in the context of legislation exposing citizens to the possibility of being declared to have engaged in corrupt conduct, the ICAC Act should not be construed so as to make the outcome turn upon individualistic opinions as opposed to an objective standard.
	
	
	It was submitted in the joint submissions that the word “adversely” required, at a minimum, that the degree of probability or possibility of the effect of conduct on an official function be capable of objective identification on rational grounds. It was submitted the possibility of adverse effect must be real and sensible.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Messrs McGuigan and Poole submitted that the word “could”, where first used in s 8(2) of the ICAC Act, referred to present capability and that absent actual effect, the subsection will only apply if there is a capability for an adverse effect to result. He submitted the more remote the impugned conduct was from the process of administration contemplated by the statute, the greater the need to identify the precise conduct which could adversely affect the exercise of the function. He emphasised that i",2016-06-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2428303,R v Colless (No 3) [2016] NSWSC 933,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 29 June 2016, after hearing from both counsel at the close of all of the evidence, I indicated that I did not propose to leave provocation to the consideration of the jury in my summing-up, and that I would give my reasons for doing so at a later stage. This judgment constitutes those reasons.
	


Background


	
	To state the background of this murder trial succinctly, there is no dispute between the parties that, on Anzac Day 2014, there was a physical altercation between two young men, the accused and the deceased. Nor is it disputed that, in the course of that altercation, the deceased suffered a stab wound to the chest that was necessarily fatal, nor that he died in hospital later that evening.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the accused voluntarily stabbed the deceased, thereby causing his death, and at the time, the accused possessed, at the least, an intention to cause really serious physical injury to the deceased.
	
	
	An alternative count of manslaughter – which, it was agreed by both counsel, should be left to the jury – appears on the indictment for clarity.
	
	
	A separate and third count of reckless wounding alleges that the accused stabbed another young man at the same time and place.
	
	
	By the close of the evidence, I understood that many of the elements for murder and manslaughter were disputed by defence counsel. They included the voluntariness of the alleged stabbing of the deceased, and whether the accused intended to cause him really serious physical injury.
	
	
	It was agreed between the parties that, based upon things said by the accused in his recorded interview with police, self-defence needed to be left to the consideration of the jury with regard to all counts.
	
	
	As for provocation, it was agreed that the version of that partial “defence” that existed up until 13 June 2014, and contained within s 23 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), was the one that should be considered, bearing in mind the date of the alleged offences.
	


Submissions of the accused


	
	Senior counsel for the accused submitted that that defence should be left, whilst making it clear that she was not contending that that was the case, in that provocation was inconsistent with the defence of self-defence, and in that sense positively disadvantageous to the accused. She also made it clear that she would not be addressing the jury in support of provocation. In other words, she was merely bringing the matter to my attention in order to avoid me falling into error by not leaving the defence to the jury.
	
	
	She made the following submissions in support of the proposition that the partial defence should be left by me.
	
	
	First, she submitted that the evidence that could potentially give rise to a defence of provocation included the reference by the accused in his interview to the events being a “blur”; an alleged campaign of harassment against the accused over many months by the deceased; the alleged verbal abuse of the accused at his premises on the night in question; and the physical confrontation itself.
	
	
	Secondly, she submitted that evidence of the necessary mental state - loss of self-control - could only arise if the jury rejected the account of the accused as to his mental state, and his position that he simply produced a knife to protect himself. She submitted that, in those circumstances, the jury could consider that he committed an intentional act based on fear (raising the issue of excessive self-defence) or anger (raising the issue of provocation).
	
	
	Thirdly, she submitted that the test of whether to leave a partial defence to the jury has a reasonably low threshold, and that the accused bears no onus with regard to the partial defence once raised. She submitted that the test had been made out in this case, and the partial defence should be left to the jury for abundant caution.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	In response, the Crown Prosecutor simply submitted that an essential pre-condition of the partial defence of provocation, as it was at the relevant time, was a loss of self-control on the part of the accused. His submission was that there was no evidence in the trial whatsoever of the accused having lost self-control.
	


Determination


	
	Turning to my determination, there was no dispute between the parties that the relevant test to be applied by me in determining whether to leave a “defence” was recently stated with clarity by the High Court in Lindsay v The Queen [2015] HCA 16; (2015) 255 CLR 272 at [16]. It is as follows:
	


The threshold question of law is whether there is material in the evidence which sufficiently raises the issue to leave the partial defence for the jury’s consideration.


	
	To my mind, the “starting point” of the partial defence of provocation in its prior form is a loss of self-control on the part of the accused. And yet there is no direct evidence of that having occurred in the evidence. I say that for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, the accused said nothing about a loss of self-control on his part, either to arresting police, interviewing detectives in his recorded interview, or to any civilians after the alleged offences.
	
	
	Secondly, the accused did not give evidence in the trial before the jury.
	
	
	Separately, there is no evidence of the observed conduct or behaviour of the accused from which one could infer a loss of self-control. Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary – the accused was allegedly engaged in a rational exchange of insults with the deceased shortly before the altercation began; after the altercation, he was engaged in a thoroughly controlled search for cigarettes, and an unremarkable interaction with his neighbour and girlfriend.
	
	
	In short, there is nothing to suggest, either directly or by a process of inference, that the accused lost self-control at the time of the alleged offence of murder.
	
	
	It is true that the accused spoke of some portion of the event as having been “a blur” in his recorded interview with police some hours later. But that was in the context of him professing to have a lack of complete memory of events as he was allegedly being struck by a large number of blows by two young men. In my evaluative judgment, that reference by the accused falls a long way short of constituting material upon which the partial defence should be left.
	
	
	It was for those reasons that I indicated to counsel before they commenced their addresses that they should address upon the assumption that provocation would not be left to the jury in my summing-up, and I did not do so.

2428313,Whalebone v Andrews [2016] NSWDC 149,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By November 2008 Roger Whalebone and Derek Andrews, who are brothers, owned 75% and 25% shares respectively of a property known as Rockey Hall, located at Bakers Swamp near Wellington, New South Wales. They also owned the associated plant equipment and stock in the same proportions. Their interests resulted from the provisions of the will of their father who died in 2007 leaving his estate to his four children in equal shares, and from the purchase by Mr Whalebone of the interests of the other two of his siblings, Christopher Whalebone and Jennifer Kelly. Probate was granted to Mr Andrews and Christopher Whalebone, the executors appointed under the will.
	
	
	Mr Andrews commenced living at the property shortly before his father’s death. He has remained in sole occupation of the property since that time, conducting business at the property using the land, plant and equipment and stock, including by selling livestock. At no stage has he accounted to Mr Whalebone for Mr Whalebone’s interest in the sold livestock, or in any other respect.
	


Issues


	
	In 2008 Mr Andrews was prepared to lease the property as tenant. Mr Whalebone says that he and Mr Andrews reached an agreement for Mr Andrews to rent the property and buy Mr Whalebone’s share of the stock and plant and equipment in accordance with a written offer by Mr Andrews. Mr Andrews denies that there was any valid acceptance. The existence of this agreement is the primary issue in the proceedings.
	
	
	By the statement of claim Mr Whalebone also claimed his share of the value of the plant and livestock, although the basis of this claim was not apparent until he was given leave at the conclusion of the trial to plead the tort of conversion.
	
	
	The circumstances of this case may give rise to other claims and remedies such as an account. But the parties agreed that those other claims and remedies are not part of this case, both because they are expressly not sought by Mr Whalebone, and because the necessary equitable remedies might not be available in this Court in any event.
	


The disputed contract


	
	On 13 November 2008 Mr Andrews signed handwritten instructions to Messrs Quirk Baker Solicitors. In this and other quoted correspondence, the errors are in the original. The handwritten document stated:

	Victoria Baker of Quirk Baker Solicitors had previously been engaged, presumably by Mr Andrews, to act for the estate. By this document, Ms Baker appears to have been instructed by Mr Andrews personally.
	
	
	Those written instructions led to a typed letter of the same date to Mr Whalebone in the following terms:

	In the statement of claim, Mr Whalebone claimed to have accepted this offer “orally and in writing…on or about 15.12.08”. This was denied by Mr Andrews. In evidence were two documents obtained from Ms Baker’s file. First, a copy of the typed letter of 13 November 2008 quoted above, with handwriting at the bottom stating: “OK to Accept 6th Dec 2008 signed Roger Whalebone”.
	
	
	Secondly, there was a handwritten letter in the following terms:

	The so-called “Rental Agreement Re Document Department of Fair Trading dated 23/4/2008” was a document headed “Application for Registration of a Business Name” for the proposed “Rockey Hall Partnership” involving Mr Whalebone and Mr Andrews. Mr Andrews disputed any connection with the document and alleged a forgery in respect of his signature on the document, a matter considered below. Mr Whalebone signed the document on 23 April 2008, some eight days later than the date of Mr Andrews’ purported signature. Further, details may have been added in the period between the signatures. In some parts of his evidence Mr Whalebone relied on the document as evidencing the contract the subject of the primary issue.
	
	
	The “Rental Agreement” is of limited assistance in identifying the existence or terms of any agreement in late 2008. The contents of the document, with its reference to Mr Whalebone and Mr Andrews as applicants together carrying out the “Rockey Hall Partnership” suggest that, as at April 2008, the brothers were going into business together, a conclusion supported by Mr Andrews’ affidavit and by handwritten notes by Mr Whalebone. But the brothers appear to have realised that they could not work together and the alternative proposal by Mr Andrews was then offered in November 2008. The Rental Agreement does, somewhat curiously, refer to both a farming business and to a “rental and purchase agreement” – the latter more closely describing the asserted agreement in this case.
	
	
	Returning to the two letters dated 6 December 2008, they were agreed to have been found in Ms Baker’s file so I must infer that she received them. There is no evidence that either document was received by Mr Andrews. Acceptance of an offer must be communicated to the offeror but acceptance by receipt by Ms Baker of those 6 December 2008 documents could be sufficient if Ms Baker was Mr Andrews’ agent. Alternatively, Ms Baker may have communicated the acceptance to Mr Andrews.
	
	
	Other matters are relevant. There are two versions of a letter dated 27 November 2008 in evidence. The first was claimed by Mr Andrews to have been received from Ms Baker. It was initialled by her and was in the following terms:

	The second version was identical in the wording but did not contain her signature or initials and the number “30” was handwritten partly over and partly above the number “40” where the letter referred to “$40,000.00”, indicating that at some stage there was a change to the document. This version was found in Ms Baker’s file.
	
	
	The repeated reference to Mr Andrews’ “instructions” and Mr Whalebone having “advised” her, may provide further support for a conclusion that Ms Baker was acting as solicitor for Mr Andrews. These letters raise an issue about whether Mr Whalebone made a counter offer rejecting the original offer of 13 November 2008.
	
	
	Other documents of relevance include a note of Mr Whalebone dated 4 October 2008, not objected to or challenged by Mr Andrews, which records Mr Andrews’ words, as follows:
	


“Derek once again offers to rent our share of the farm & purchase our share of plant & equipment + buy our livestock. Derek said “Roger I will visit my solicitor Victoria Baker & organise the payment for you I want to be a sole trader, I do not want to go into business with you, Roger we don’t get along at all.”


	
	Further, a handwritten letter to Mr Andrews dated 16 December 2008 was in the following terms:

	Mr Andrews denies receiving this correspondence. No payments were made by Mr Andrews.
	
	
	In mid-2009 Mr Whalebone, directly and via his solicitor, was complaining about an absence of payment.
	
	
	Apart from Mr Andrews having paid the statutory charges on the land, neither Mr Andrews nor Mr Whalebone have made any payment in accordance with the terms of the 13 November 2008 letter.
	


The plaintiff’s evidence


	
	Mr Whalebone swore two affidavits. There was no evidence (in an admissible form) about acceptance in either. Leave was granted for Mr Whalebone to give further evidence in chief orally, and the following exchange occurred:
	


“Q. You told the Court, in evidence, that on 13 November you received a letter with an offer in it?

…

Q. In relation to that offer, did you do something?

A. Yes.

Q. Who did you contact?

A. Victoria Baker Bourke at Wellington, and also my brother, Derek.

Q. When you contacted your brother, how did you do that?

A. We drove to the farm and visited him, particularly after the second time when probate was granted, and we made also many phone calls. We always rang, communicated.

Q. In relation to those phone calls, when were they made?

A. During the same period of time, all through 2008, November, December.

Q. In relation to the offer, did you say something to your brother about the offer?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you say to him?

A. We will accept the $30,000.  We originally wanted $40,000. In reference to Mr Paul Cudden at the rear of the property, on the eastern side boundary, had offered $40,000 per annum to rent the property, my 75% share. And because my brother Derek wanted to stay on the farm, we accepted his offer of $30,000, along with the purchase of all our livestock, plant and equipment, motor vehicles, and a number of antique belongings.

Q. That acceptance was made over the phone?

A. Yes.

Q. That was around what date, do you remember?

A. Around the first, there was a written agreement done in April 2008.”


	
	Mr Whalebone’s wife, Han Ying Whalebone, also swore an affidavit largely in identical terms to Mr Whalebone’s affidavits and was cross-examined. She gave no evidence about the telephone conversation on 15 December 2008.
	
	
	Mr Andrews denied any such conversation.
	


Credit of Mr Whalebone


	
	Mr Whalebone’s evidence of this conversation of November or December 2008 was challenged on a number of bases.
	
	
	First, Mr Whalebone pleaded that “The Offer was accepted orally and in writing by the Plaintiff on or about 15.12.08”. Mr Andrews submitted that there was no evidence of the written acceptance. However, the documents in Ms Baker’s file, quoted earlier, regarding the offer dated 13 November 2008 evidence at least a purported written acceptance by letters dated 6 and 16 December 2008.
	
	
	Secondly, Mr Andrews submitted that correspondence from Mr Whalebone’s solicitor, John Dowling, in 2009 does not provide unequivocal support for the existence of acceptance of the 13 November 2008 offer. On 5 June 2009 Mr Dowling wrote to Mr Andrews as Mr Whalebone’s solicitor in the following terms:
	


“Dear Sir

RE: FORMAL DEMAND

PROPERY “ROCKEY HALL” AND CATTLE AND STOCK AND EQUIPMENT THEREON

I act for Roger Whalebone. I note that he is a tenant in common as to a 3/4th share in the property and improvements and the cattle and equipment (""the property"") situated thereon.

I have been instructed that:

 

1. You do not wish to be bought out of your 1/4th interest in the property.

2. Without lawful authority you have sold off approximately 48 head of cattle without reference to Mr Whalebone.

3. You have failed to account to Mr Whalebone for the sales.

4. You deny lawful access to my client to the property.

5. You have failed to honour an agreement to pay rent for the property to Mr Whalebone.

Unless these matters are resolved forthwith and no later than the 19th June 2009 I am instructed to forthwith apply to the Supreme Court for orders that either the property be sold or that you be bought out and that you account for sales and other disposals of assets. An order will also be sought seeking the appointment of a Court Appointed Receiver to the property to preserve the assets pending finalization of the Court proceedings. Legal costs will also be claimed together with interest

It is respectfully suggested that you obtain legal advice concerning these matters.

[signature]

Yours faithfully,

John Dowling 

Solicitor”.


	
	This letter refers to an “agreement to pay rent”, a component of the disputed agreement. However, it also focuses on matters other than the monies which would be owed had the 13 November 2008 offer been accepted and become an agreement, and there is no reference to monies owed for stock or for plant, other than an assertion that Mr Whalebone retained a three-quarter interest in the cattle and equipment and that Mr Andrews had failed to account for the sales.
	
	
	Mr Dowling spoke to Mr Andrews by telephone on a without prejudice basis. Then on 23 June 2009 Mr Dowling wrote again, providing a copy of the 13 November 2008 offer and asserted that it “was accepted orally by my client”. Mr Andrews retained a solicitor who on 6 July 2009 responded to Mr Dowling asserting that “no agreement has been reached between our clients” and referred to a Deed of Family Arrangement, a document not in evidence.
	
	
	Mr Dowling responded to Mr Andrews’ solicitor on 10 July 2009, providing a copy of the letter of 13 November 2008, asserting an acceptance by Mr Whalebone directly to Mr Andrews, referring to an “alarming” claim by Mr Andrews of “outright ownership of the stock as declared to the selling agent as set out in their letter dated 9th July 2009” and put forward a proposal.
	
	
	Mr Dowling’s letter of 23 June 2009 asserts an agreement and is broadly consistent with Mr Whalebone’s claim. Although the reference to the cattle and equipment in the earlier letter dated 5 June 2009 differs from the asserted agreement, the three letters (5 June 2009, 23 June 2009 and 10 July 2009) are each broadly or specifically supportive of Mr Whalebone’s claim of a rental agreement.
	
	
	Thirdly, Mr Andrews submitted that the plaintiff was guilty of “outright forgery” of the defendant’s signature in the April 2008 document. This allegation is not supported by an expert or other evidence but is dependent on Mr Andrews’ evidence that he had “never seen the document” and that “[a]lthough my purported signature…somewhat resembles my signature, I never signed or dated the document”. The basis for the allegation of forgery was weakened by Mr Andrews’ oral evidence. When asked about this signature he stated, “That appears to be my signature” and subsequently, “I don’t recall signing the document at all”. Mr Andrews did not press in closing submissions an allegation of forgery. In light of his oral evidence and the similarity of the disputed signature with Mr Andrews’ signature in his affidavit, I find on the balance of probabilities that the signature was a genuine signature of Mr Andrews. Thus, the submission of forgery is without foundation.
	
	
	Fourthly, Mr Whalebone claimed to have a diary in which he made important notations such as “contractual agreements and arrangements and promises”. The diary was called for. Mr Whalebone’s counsel said he would be able to produce it, “but I need a bit of time” as it “would be in storage”. Although the matter was adjourned for some weeks, and the document not produced at the time of recommencement, the call for the diary was not repeated after the adjournment. In those circumstances, I do not think the absence of the diary should be accorded great importance. On the other hand, its absence precludes there being other contemporaneous support for acceptance. Whether the reference to a diary included the handwritten notes in evidence was never clarified.
	
	
	Fifthly, Mr Andrews criticised the manner in which the plaintiff gave answers. However, Mr Whalebone did not appear to be a highly educated man and I did not regard the form of his answers as indicating any dishonesty. It might be surprising if the purity of his recollection of conversations remained unaffected by the passage of time and the circumstance that he had not been paid any amount for seven years by his brother for the exclusive use of substantial property, stock, plant and equipment largely owned by Mr Whalebone.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Whalebone’s affidavit evidence and his case generally were not prepared with care by him or those he instructed. Crucial correspondence was tendered only after the initial trial had concluded, and his evidence, when initially given, had little documentary material to support it. None of these matters impact on Mr Whalebone’s honesty. I accept him to be an honest witness, even if his recollections were not always clear or reliable.
	


Credit of Mr Andrews


	
	I have mentioned already Mr Andrews’ false assertion of forgery of his signature by Mr Whalebone. That is not a matter that bolsters Mr Andrews’ credit. Serious unfounded allegations may indicate the witness to be unreliable and to be inclined to prefer his interest to his recollection. The damage to Mr Andrews’ credit may be mitigated to some extent by the circumstance that the document is not of crucial relevance, and the form of the document indicates that some additional details may have been inserted after Mr Andrews signed it.
	
	
	Mr Andrews, in his affidavit, denied receiving any of the correspondence from Mr Dowling in June 2009, including that he had never received the letter dated 23 June 2009 from Mr Dowling. However, in oral evidence Mr Andrews accepted that he did receive that letter, attributing his error to having “completely forgotten all about it until just recently” and that his memory of communications with Mr Dowling “is a bit vague”. He also implicitly acknowledged receipt of the letter in his defence. Also, Mr Andrews must have received the earlier letter dated 5 June 2009, because he handed it to his solicitors and gave them instructions to respond to it.
	
	
	I cannot ignore that Mr Andrews’ evidence indicates an inaccurate and biased view about his conduct. He retained and used for his own purposes plant and equipment valued at $28,575, which he knew to be 75% owned by his brother at a time when both knew of the need for a formal agreement to resolve their differences. Similarly, he dealt with stock valued at almost $100,000, which were 75% owned by his brother. Although through his solicitors he conveyed that he was “prepared to account to [Mr Whalebone] for income and expenditure since the commencement of the enterprise on 1 October 2008”, he never has. His justification for not accounting to the plaintiff for sales of livestock was that Mr Whalebone had not contributed to the rates: “I formed the view that the Plaintiff would not contribute any funds for the operation of the Property or the livestock and [therefore I] have not accounted for any sale proceeds of the livestock since November 2008.” Apparently debiting Mr Whalebone’s proportion of any costs against Mr Whalebone’s undoubted entitlement to a share of the proceeds of the sale of the cattle did not find favour with Mr Andrews.
	
	
	Further, Mr Andrews’ affidavit evidence recounts his expenditure on the farming operation for the purposes of claiming a credit against any money owed. But at no stage did he disclose any details of the income he received from the farm. Expenses may be relevant in an action for an account of the farm income, but they are not relevant to rent owed under a rental agreement, and without details of revenue received cannot excuse a conversion. Mr Andrews was not commercially naive. In my view, his failure to reveal farm revenue precludes the expenses constituting a credit against Mr Whalebone’s claim, and also does not assist his credit.
	
	
	Mr Andrews also claims as a set off that he is entitled to about $40,000 per year for looking after the property since 2008, if he is liable under the rental agreement. If such a rental agreement exists, there is no scope for any countervailing claim for a wage for caretaking a property he has rented. The claim is so lacking in merit as to also impact adversely on his credit.
	


Conclusion


	
	I do not regard the recollection of Mr Andrews as at all reliable. Although I prefer the evidence of Mr Whalebone, his recollection is also not without problems.
	
	
	I do not accept Mr Andrews’ denials of any communications with Mr Whalebone or discussions with him about the offer. The evidence contains Mr Whalebone’s notes of these conversations. But the notes do not purport to be a verbatim record of the conversations and recollections of oral conversations now seven years old are not likely to be at all accurate. The effect of oral conversations can turn on one word, one phrase, even potentially one pause or accent: see Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 at 318-319. In these circumstances, reliance is best placed on the surrounding circumstances and contemporaneous written communications.
	
	
	The communications must be assessed against a background principle that it is rare for substantial commercial transactions to be concluded by conversations or informal documents, without the presence of a formal executed contract: see RT & YE Falls Investments Pty Ltd v The State of New South Wales and Ors [2001] NSWSC 1027 at [56]-[58] and the authorities there mentioned. In that case, Palmer J stated at [57]:
	


“Allegations that such informal contracts have come into existence upon the basis of conversations – invariably disputed – are generally found to be the last refuge of the desperate.”

On the other hand, the parties to this purported transaction are brothers, and that might be expected to result in a greater degree of informality.


	
	Despite all the difficulties with Mr Whalebone’s evidence I am persuaded that in December 2008 he did orally communicate to Mr Andrews and to Ms Baker his willingness to accept the terms of Mr Andrews’ 13 November 2008 offer. His written notes and his correspondence confirm this willingness and communication. But two problems with finding a contract remain.
	
	
	First, the agreement for lease is not registered or in registrable form so at common law it could only be for a period of not more than three years, pursuant to s 51(3) of the Real Property Act 1900. In any event, no term is specified in any conversation or document in evidence. Mr Whalebone urged the Court to find a three-year lease, but there is no basis to find that term.
	
	
	Section 127(1) of the Conveyancing Act 1919 provides that:
	


127 Tenancy from year to year not to be implied

(1) No tenancy from year to year shall, after the commencement of this Act, be implied by payment of rent; if there is a tenancy, and no agreement as to its duration, then such tenancy shall be deemed to be a tenancy determinable at the will of either of the parties by one month’s notice in writing expiring at any time.

…”


	
	If an annual tenancy is not implied by payment, nor can it be implied merely by a promise to pay. Thus, if there is a tenancy, and no agreement as to its duration, I must find it a tenancy determinable at will on a month’s notice. And Mr Andrews’ solicitor’s letter of July 2009 denying an agreement is sufficient notice of termination.
	
	
	However, the absence of any evidence of a term and a start date does more than merely confine the tenancy to a tenancy at will. These omissions, together with the absence of any payment of rent, indicate that the parties had not finally agreed on all of the necessary terms.
	
	
	The second problem is that the evidence indicates that Mr Whalebone proposed an alternative deal to Ms Baker in late November 2008. Leaving aside whether the rent would be $30,000 or $40,000, a clear counter offer, the expressed desire of Mr Whalebone to purchase Mr Andrews’ interest in two trucks which Mr Andrews had offered to buy is, without more, an indication of a counter offer. And if it is a counter offer, it is a rejection of Mr Andrews’ offer of 13 November 2008. There was then no offer available to accept: see Hyde v Wrench (1840) 3 Beav 334.
	
	
	Mr Whalebone submitted that the letter of 27 November 2008 indicated no more than a request for information, similar to Stevenson, Jaques & Co v McLean (1880) 5 QBD 346. This submission underlines the importance of what Mr Whalebone said to Ms Baker that prompted the 27 November 2008 letter. Mr Whalebone’s evidence about this is unclear, and Ms Baker, for reasons which elude me, was not subpoenaed or called by either party even though she was apparently available.
	
	
	The uncertainty about whether Mr Whalebone’s intention was that the rent be $40,000, or agreed at $30,000, compounds this problem. Although Mr Whalebone submitted that he “hotly denies” such a counter offer, his affidavit, after referring to the 13 November 2008 offer, states: “I originally wanted $40,000 per year but Derek refused to agree to this amount, Derek Andrews would not pay this amount” and referred to the 27 November 2008 letter in this context. His chronology, although containing other errors, states “Plaintiff originally wanted $40,000 (letter 27 November 2008)”.
	
	
	If the letter of 27 November 2008, or the events leading to it, were a counter offer, then Mr Whalebone’s purported acceptance of the 13 November 2008 offer becomes a further offer. There is no evidence of any acceptance by Mr Andrews of this offer by Mr Whalebone.
	
	
	Bearing all these matters in mind, I am not persuaded that an agreement in the terms asserted was reached. I accept that Mr Whalebone believed that an agreement had been reached. Mr Andrews may even have suspected Mr Whalebone’s belief. But no estoppel was alleged and the subjective intentions of the parties are not enough. In my view, although the parties recognised that the partnership business evidenced by the 23 April 2008 document could not continue, the proposal of a purchase (of the stock and machinery) and rental (of the property) arrangement was never finalised. The absence of any unequivocal conduct by the parties pursuant to the terms of the 13 November 2008 letter supports this conclusion.
	


The claim for conversion

(a) Plant and the use of the farm


	
	Mr Whalebone did not identify any case where a co-owner by mere use of personalty or realty had committed the tort of conversion. That was not his case. He complained of being excluded from the farm by Mr Andrews, and that thereby Mr Andrews had converted the machinery.
	
	
	But mere exclusion from the farm says nothing about the use of machinery. Nor is there evidence that Mr Whalebone wished, or expressed a wish, to use the machinery, on the farm or elsewhere. I do not find that Mr Andrews has converted the plant.
	
	
	Mr Whalebone’s claim in respect of Mr Andrews’ use of the farm was confined to his claim in contract, which I have dismissed.
	


(b) Stock


	
	Mr Andrews sold stock and did not account for any of the proceeds to Mr Whalebone. His defence to conversion is that substantial damages could not be awarded because Mr Whalebone has not proved how many of the cattle were sold.
	
	
	Mr Andrews submitted that a valuation dated July 2007 was agreed to by the parties to indicate the amount and value of the stock in late 2008, subject to any sales during the administration of the estate. Mr Whalebone disputed the rider. Mr Andrews’ affidavit disputes the currency of the valuation. However, Mr Andrews possessed knowledge about all stock sales but declined to give that evidence. He was not cross-examined about his silence. Mr Whalebone, of course, could not know when and at what price cattle were sold.
	
	
	The valuation in 2007 valued the 185 head of cattle at $99,500. There was evidence of 180 head of cattle in 2009. Mr Whalebone gave evidence that the cattle numbers hardly altered while Mr Andrews indicated that numbers “fluctuated because of natural causes – births and deaths – and also sales”. Mr Andrews gave no evidence of the extent of natural losses nor any thefts or other reasons for reduced numbers. Sales of cattle after the administration of the estate would not reduce Mr Whalebone’s entitlement.
	
	
	Because of my limited preference for Mr Whalebone as a witness and because I should not infer a matter in favour of Mr Andrews – a lower number of cattle – when he could have given evidence about that matter but declined to do so, I would infer that from the completion of administration until mid-2009 the number of stock was approximately 185, and had a value approximately indicated by the valuation in evidence. Mr Whalebone had a 75% interest in those cattle, and was entitled to 75% of the proceeds of any sale.
	
	
	Accordingly, I find that Mr Andrews has converted the stock sales income to his own use, and must account to Mr Whalebone for 75% of that amount. The best estimate of that amount is the value of the cattle, namely $74,625 (75% x $99,500). Although it may be that not all of the stock was sold by 1 January 2009, by that stage Mr Andrews was treating them all as his own, selling some and retaining the proceeds, retaining others and keeping or selling their progeny.
	
	
	A fair measure of damages for converting the stock proceeds is, in my view, $74,625 plus interest from 1 January 2009, which at the statutory court rates amounts to $42,649.50.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose to give judgment in favour of Mr Whalebone in the sum of $117,274.50 ($74,625 + $42,649.50). I will hear the parties as to costs.
	


Orders


	
	The orders of the Court are:
	



	
	Judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of $117,274.50.
	
	
	Argument on costs to be reserved to a date to be fixed.

		28 July 2016",2016-06-29 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2428418,Jeyavel Thangavelautham v R [2016] NSWCCA 141,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

Mr Jeyavel Thangavelautham (the applicant) was the ringleader of an operation whereby credit and debit card numbers and personal identification numbers (PINs) were skimmed via a dummy EFTPOS terminal (the terminal). The applicant, who entered Australia under a false name, imported the terminal from overseas. Together with his co-offender, Mr Jeyapalasingham, he solicited the owner of the Indian House Supermarket in Strathfield, Mr Junaidy, to install the terminal in his shop. The applicant also arranged for a “technician”, with the capacity and knowledge to manipulate the terminal, Mr Baskaran, to be flown to Australia.

Mr Jeyapalasingham acted primarily as a middleman between the applicant and Mr Junaidy. He was also largely responsible, together with another co-offender, Mr Krishnan, for procuring the services of, and obtaining fake identification for, a student, “Hari”, who would purport to be employed at the Indian House Supermarket and would be recorded on its CCTV footage before leaving Australia. Hari was to provide a “plausible deniability” excuse for Mr Junaidy. Evidence indicated that all those involved were to be rewarded, but none more so than the applicant.

Intercepted phone calls between the co-offenders indicated that they intended to skim approximately 1000 cards. There was also evidence that the store in Strathfield was not the only intended site of operation.

The terminal was successfully manipulated such that it did not communicate with financial institutions but rather skimmed the credit and debit card data and printed false receipts. The terminal was installed at the Indian House Supermarket and skimmed the data of at least four cards. The student, Hari, pulled out of the operation and before any more cards were skimmed, the police intervened and arrested the applicant and Messrs Jeyapalasingham, Junaidy, Baskaran and Krishnan.

The applicant was charged, inter alia, with conspiracy to defraud persons unknown. In particulars, provided upon request by the Crown, the applicant was charged with “by deception, dishonestly obtaining the property belonging to another person/persons, namely the credit card particulars and PIN’s and/or obtaining a financial advantage or causing a financial disadvantage”.

The applicant pleaded not guilty to the offence. While he consented to the tender of a large amount of evidence by the prosecution, he declined to make submissions as to the purpose of his activities or to indicate before closing submissions his reasons for being not guilty.

The applicant was found guilty and sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months. For the relevant conspiracy, Mr Jeyapalasingham was given an indicative sentence of 4 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 10 months, after a 15% discount for a plea of guilty and a finding of special circumstances. He was, at the same time, sentenced for another conspiracy and given an aggregate sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.

The issues on appeal were:

1.   Whether the verdict was unreasonable where the evidence left open the possibility that the object of the conspiracy was to on-sell the customers’ data once it had been harvested, rather than to use the data personally.

2.   Whether the primary judge failed to mitigate the applicant’s sentence in view of the manner in which the trial was conducted.

3.   Whether the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance in light of the sentence imposed upon Mr Jeyapalasingham.

4.   Whether the sentence was manifestly excessive.

The Court held (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL agreeing, R S Hulme AJ dissenting as to sentence) dismissing the conviction appeal but allowing the sentence appeal:

Conviction appeal

(i)   For the offence of conspiracy to defraud to be made out, it is necessary for the conspirators to have an intention to defraud; it is not enough that they have an expectation that the offence of fraud will be committed: [18] (Bathurst CJ); [97] (Hoeben CJ at CL); [98] (R S Hulme AJ).

Gerakiteys v The Queen [1984] HCA 8; 153 CLR 317; R v LK [2010] HCA 17; 241 CLR 177; Peters v The Queen [1998] HCA 7; 192 CLR 493 applied

(ii)   Conspiracy to defraud involves an agreement to bring about a situation prejudicing or imperilling existing legal rights or interests of others. It is sufficient that the conspirators intend to take some advantage to themselves by putting another’s property at risk or depriving a person of a lawful opportunity to obtain or protect property: [23] (Bathurst CJ); [97] (Hoeben CJ at CL); [98] (R S Hulme AJ).

Peters v The Queen [1998] HCA 7; 192 CLR 493; Bolitho v Western Australia [2007] WASCA 102; 34 WAR 215; R v Kastratovic (1985) 42 SASR 59 applied

(iii)   The taking of credit card information put at risk the underlying accounts to which the cards related by providing the means for unauthorised access to those accounts. Where this risk was produced either by selling the data or using it personally, and by means that were admittedly deceptive and dishonest, the offence of conspiracy to defraud was made out: [22], [24] (Bathurst CJ); [97] (Hoeben CJ at CL); [98] (R S Hulme AJ).

Manner in which trial was conducted

(iv)   There are cases where the conduct of the offender in facilitating the course of justice is a matter which can be taken into account in the sentencing process, however, it is not a mandatory consideration and the extent to which it warrants consideration is a matter for the sentencing judge: [56]-[58] (Bathurst CJ); [97] (Hoeben CJ at CL); [98] (R S Hulme AJ).

R v Doff [2005] NSWCCA 119; 54 ACSR 200; R v Nguyen & Luong [2011] NSWSC 562 distinguished

Justifiable sense of grievance

(v)   In considering the parity principle, it is necessary to have regard to aggregate sentences, however, indicative sentences may be a guide as to whether the aggregate sentence is excessive: [70] (Bathurst CJ); [97] (Hoeben CJ at CL).

JM v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 297 applied

(vi)   It is not a necessary condition to the application of the parity principle that the charges be formally identical, nor can the principle be ignored where aggregate sentences involve not only the same crimes but separate crimes which the person whose sentences are being compared have committed: [71]-[72] (Bathurst CJ); [97] (Hoeben CJ at CL).

Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 applied

(vii)   It was necessary to take into account that there were subjective factors present in the case of the co-offender not present in the case of the applicant and that the applicant played a larger role in the conspiracy, however, these matters did not justify the disparity in sentence; nor could it be justified by a comparison of aggregate sentences, which included additional crimes in each case: [76]-[77] (Bathurst CJ); [97] (Hoeben CJ at CL).

(viii)   In was an error, in sentencing the applicant, to make no reference to the sentence imposed upon his co-offender and to not consider the question of parity: [78] (Bathurst CJ); [97] (Hoeben CJ at CL).

(ix)   (R S Hulme AJ in dissent): The disparity between the co-offenders was justified having regard to their respective entrepreneurial levels and intended rewards and the high degree of sophistication of the applicant’s operation: [101]-[103] (R S Hulme AJ).

(x)   (R S Hulme AJ in dissent): In any event, the magnitude of the applicant’s offending and the need for general deterrence against the major threat of credit card fraud required that the sentence not be disturbed: [104]-[107] (R S Hulme AJ).

	Following a judge alone trial the applicant was convicted on Counts 1-4 but acquitted on Count 5. He was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 11 years imprisonment commencing on 14 August 2011 and expiring on 13 August 2022. The trial judge, declining to find special circumstances, fixed a non-parole period of 8 years 3 months expiring on 13 November 2019. The applicant has appealed against his conviction on Count 1 on the sole ground that the verdict was unreasonable. He has also appealed against the sentence imposed on him.
	
	
	There is no dispute as to the primary facts surrounding the transactions said to give rise to the offences. They were set out uncontroversially by the primary judge in the following terms:
	


“In June 2009 the Fraud and Cyber Crime Squad of the State Crime Command of the New South Wales Police Force commenced to investigate the use of electronic card skimming devices and PIN pad underlays utilised in electronic funds transfer point of sale, known by acronym as EFTPOS terminals. The illegally captured data would then be used to create a cloned or duplicate credit or debit cards by encoding blank plastic cards with the data stolen or skimmed from the original card. Such cloned or duplicate credit or debit cards could then be used both in Australia and internationally to unlawfully withdraw funds from individuals’ accounts. Alternatively, offenders could on-sell card data on the international market for profit.

The EFTPOS terminal is manipulated through the covert installation of an electronic skimming device or alternatively installation of unlawful software, so as to capture card data information. A PIN pad underlay can capture the electronic personal identification number known as the ‘PIN’. The devices or software capture both the card data and the PIN relevant to the card. The manipulated terminal is either connected to the financial services network or there is put in place a substitute or ‘dummy’ terminal. A dummy terminal is not connected to the financial services provider’s network; as a result any transaction via that terminal is not communicated to the financial network and [as] a result a cardholder’s account is not debited for the transaction. But the details of the card, being the card number and the PIN, are skimmed and available to the conspirators.

As background there is tendered before me the information that EFTPOS terminals can be compromised either at the merchant location, or the existing terminal can be removed from the merchant location and manipulated elsewhere and then returned for reinstallation. Another method is to produce a new specific terminal manipulating and identifying the merchant location that uses the same make and model terminal. That duplicate EFTPOS machine is then installed. There is a negotiated price paid to the merchant provided he is aware of the activity. It is possible that it can be installed covertly, that is, unknown to the merchant. Steps can be taken to ensure that if the merchant is aware of the activity he can be provided with what is described as a ‘plausible deniability’ seeking to deflect criminal involvement to others.

Once the material is harvested then blank plastic credit cards with magnetic strips can be encoded with the harvested material, thereby creating a cloned or duplicate debit or credit card. The PIN is matched to that data. On some occasions that PIN can be recorded in writing on a sticker attached to the face of the cloned card. Once the cloning has occurred the cards can be used at automatic teller machines both in Australia and internationally to withdraw cash from the unfortunate victim’s [sic] accounts. If the harvested data is not used by the perpetrators of the offence to make cloned credit or debit cards the data itself can be sold both in Australia and overseas.

The Evidence

The Strike Force set up by the New South Wales Police Service was given the name Wigg. Amongst other persons of interest, the accused, Jeyavel Thangavelautham, also became a person of interest. In July 2011 investigators received information that the accused was in Australia and sought, by surveillance methods, to locate him. At that stage the Department of Immigration indicated that the accused had not entered Australia under his real name or identity which he had used previously to either gain entry to Australia or to unsuccessfully attempt to gain entry to Australia. On the limited evidence before this Court it appears common ground that the prosecution is not able to establish how it was that the accused made his way into Australia around the period 2011.

Investigators established that the accused was using a number of mobile telephone numbers. Police obtained interception warrants so as to monitor the accused's telephone calls with others. The accused was lawfully intercepted speaking with a co-accused Jeyapalasingham and also Baskaran. He spoke also to other people. In one intercepted call on 20 July 2011 the accused was heard to tell his wife on a telephone call to North America that he was using particular telephone services to call particular people so as to avoid detection of his conduct.

The police intercepted seven mobile telephone services utilised by the accused. The alleged co-offender Jeyapalasingham was said to use two different mobile phones to contact associates. Those mobile phone numbers attributed to this accused and his co-accused Jeyapalasingham were then subject to lawful telephone interception. Police monitored in excess of 1,600 calls during the relevant operation concerning this accused and his alleged co-offenders. More than 300 were specifically relevant to the charges before this Court. Some of the conversations intercepted were in code. The conversations, on the prosecution’s case, related to the importation of skimming equipment including a new EFTPOS terminal, the manipulation of that terminal and arrangements to locate a merchant who would consent to a compromised terminal being installed in his business premises. There was also conversation concerning the negotiation of payment to the merchant and the organising and planning of a specific course of action in arranging the installation of the EFTPOS machine; that planning including the engagement of a person who was purported to be employed by the merchant and to whom the finger of guilt would turn should the activity become known by the relevant authorities. The employment of that person, who was intended to leave Australia very shortly after the criminal activity, was to enable the merchant to establish plausible deniability.

Police not only utilised interception of telephone services but on 4 August 2011, after the arrival in Australia of the co-accused Baskaran, the police installed what is known as an integrated device which captured both the video and audio of activities within a unit where the accused lived with Baskaran at Auburn, in western Sydney. That audio-visual device continued to operate from 5 August 2011 until the arrest of all co-accused on 14 August 2011.

The evidence concerning count 1, the alleged conspiracy, is as follows. Between 13 July and 19 July 2011 the police intercepted telephone calls made by or to this accused, Mr Thangavelautham. Those calls concern the importation into Australia of a VeriFone VX670 EFTPOS terminal by the accused. That terminal was intended to be used as a ‘dummy’ terminal at a business known as the Indian House Supermarket at Strathfield. That business was owned and operated in partnership by the accused Junaidy and another person.

On 13 July 2011 the accused made a telephone call to an unknown male in Canada. There was conversation about the VeriFone VX670. The accused was told to type that identification number into Google on the internet; the Canadian male told the accused to check the third photograph on the website, www.verifone.com, which included the stand for that EFTPOS machine. The accused confirmed that, having seen that photograph, it was of the type he wanted to have posted to him.

The following day, Thursday 14 July, the accused called the unknown male again in Canada. That male told the accused that there would be two packages sent to Australia; one would be sent by the unknown male from Canada and the other would be sent from USA. One package was to arrive in Australia on the following Monday and the next the day after. On Sunday 17 July 2011 police investigators became aware that two items, being the VeriFone EFTPOS terminal and its base unit, had been sent to Australia. On 17 July Australian Customs intercepted the base unit which had been sent from Miami in the United States. Police photographed that unit and allowed it to continue on a controlled delivery to the intended destination at Winrich Lighting Palace in High Street in Penrith. Other evidence satisfies me that such business was operated by people related by marriage to the accused’s brother who lived in western Sydney.

The following day, Monday 18 July 2011, Customs intercepted the Verifone VX670 EFTPOS terminal; it had been secreted inside a video camera box. Within the box authorities found cables for that terminal and also a 4 gigabyte USB data storage device. Examination revealed that the data on that USB drive included the software for the VeriFone terminal and 40 lines of debit/credit numbers, PIN numbers and account details. Again, authorities allowed that delivery to continue to its intended destination at Winrich Lighting Palace. Just after 10am on that day, 18 July, the accused telephoned the courier company responsible for the delivery of the package to Australia. Amongst other things, he told the courier company that he was ‘waiting for it’. He was advised it would arrive either that or the next day.

The next day, Tuesday 19 July 2011, the accused telephoned Winrich Lighting Palace in High Street in Penrith and was advised that a package had arrived the previous day. He was told what was within the package. He informed the female to whom he spoke that a second package would be delivered that day and she should call him when it arrived. The unit that arrived first was the base unit which she referred to as the ‘charger’. Later that afternoon police observed the delivery of that second package by courier to the Winrich Lighting Palace. Not long thereafter the accused made a call to the unknown male in Canada through whom the delivery arrangements had been made; he told that male that the packages had arrived. When the lighting shop was closed that day the only employee was seen to walk from the premises to a nearby address in Penrith which was the residential address of the accused’s brother, Ravi Thangavelautham.

Later that evening the accused made a call to an unknown male and asked the male if he was aware of any locations where a dummy terminal could be installed. It was apparent that the accused was soliciting sites so that he could utilise more than one terminal.

The next week, 26 July 2011, the accused received a call from the co-accused Jeyapalasingham. Arrangements were made for them to meet with the co-accused Junaidy, who is the merchant whose business was to be used for the installation of the terminal. Two days later the accused and his co-accused Jeyapalasingham had a meeting with Mr Junaidy and another person. Their conversation included the topic of utilising Mr Junaidy’s ‘Indian House’ store on The Boulevarde at Strathfield for the purposes of skimming card details using the recently imported VeriFone EFTPOS terminal as a ‘dummy’ machine.

The next day, 29 July 2011, the accused again called the unknown male in Canada. He informed that person that he would be undertaking activities the next week. He enquired of that Canadian male whether the shop name ‘could be changed’. I accept that that conversation related to the printed receipt that would be produced by the dummy EFTPOS terminal after a transaction had been processed. To enable the terminal to work effectively, and importantly not to arouse the customer’s suspicion, the printed details on the receipt should record the merchant location amongst other things. The Canadian male commenced to explain how to achieve that alteration to the terminal but the accused requested that he wait until his ‘brother arrives’ so that the Canadian male could explain it to that person. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the ‘brother’ referred to was ‘the technician’, namely the co-accused Baskaran. He had the capacity and the knowledge to manipulate the terminal.

On 1 August 2011, a Monday, the accused telephoned his wife in Canada. He told her he was looking for another place to live. He also told her that an associate would be arriving on 3 August and there was a possibility they would conduct ‘a job’ on the next Saturday 6 August. The associate who was arriving on 3 August would, I conclude, after he was rested, be able to work upon the terminal on 4 August. The accused also told his wife that he had ‘another team’ due to come to Australia on 13 August with the intention of doing work on 20 August. The prosecution relies on that conversation between the accused and his wife to establish that the accused had intentions beyond the placement of the dummy terminal in the Strathfield shop to which I have referred.

Later that evening the accused called the same unknown male in Canada. He gave instructions to that male which were to be relayed to the co-accused Baskaran. Baskaran was to travel from, as I understand, Canada to Australia and would use his expertise to manipulate the EFTPOS machine which had arrived earlier. The accused gave instructions that Baskaran was to tell Customs officials on his entry to Australia that his visit was for the purpose of visiting his cousin. The accused also told the unknown Canadian male that the accused was to use a particular address in Auburn which was where Baskaran was to go once he had cleared through Customs and Immigration.

Instructions the accused had given were intended, I conclude, to reduce any suspicions of Customs or Immigration as regards Baskaran’s visit. The accused had been observed by police on a number of occasions during the investigation to visit a unit block at number 90 Northumberland Road, Auburn which is the address he had instructed Baskaran to utilise on his arrival in Australia.

Next day, 2 August 2011, the accused submitted an application to rent a unit in 3/67 Harrow Road, Auburn. The accused used the name of another individual, Akilan Kopalapillai, for the purposes of his rental application. When that rental application was successful the investigating police planted an integrated surveillance device capturing both audio and video in that unit.. When Baskaran arrived in Australia he lived in that unit in 3/67 Harrow Road, Auburn with the accused. There has been tendered before me the detail of conversations between them in that unit over the next ten days approximately. It also captured video of the activities of the two co-accused in the unit. The person, Akilan Kopalapillai, was actually observed as residing in 90 Northumberland Road, Auburn; the accused was observed to visit that address on a number of occasions. The accused used that person’s identity for the purposes of entering the lease.

On Wednesday 3 August the accused again contacted the unknown male in Canada. That male then gave him the name of the technician who would be travelling to Australia, namely, Sutharasan Baskaran. Telephone intercepts establish that Baskaran was flown to Australia for the purpose of manipulating the EFTPOS terminals so as to harvest credit or debit card information.

Later that day, 3 August 2011, the accused telephoned an unknown male, this time in the United Kingdom. He discussed the skimming operations he was about to conduct and also revealed how many credit or debit card numbers he planned to obtain. He stated that the co-accused, Junaidy, being the merchant, had requested a fee of $25,000 but negotiations had resulted in an initial payment of $15,000. The accused in that conversation also revealed that he had to pay about $2,000 to Mr Junaidy to compensate him for the loss of stock as a result of 50 transactions. Obviously the customers with their individual cards were transacting the purchase of items from Mr Junaidy’s business but, because the dummy machine was not linked to the financial services provider, the business would not receive credit for those transactions. The accused was revealing to the unknown male in the United Kingdom that he would be paying for those transactions as compensation to Mr Junaidy.

The next day, 4 August 2011, the accused was observed to attend the Sydney International Airport and pick up the co-accused Baskaran who had just arrived from Canada. Later that morning the accused again called the unknown Canadian male. He informed that person that Baskaran had cleared Customs. Baskaran then spoke to the Canadian male on the telephone. They spoke about their relief that Baskaran had cleared Customs; the Canadian male stated to Baskaran ‘I was holding onto my heart, brother’.

Later that morning this accused and Baskaran attended at the address in 90 Northumberland Road, Auburn. Later that afternoon the co-accused Jeyapalasingham contacted a co-accused Krishnan. The purpose of that conversation was to determine whether Krishnan had arranged for ‘a boy’ to purport to work in the Strathfield business so as to give ‘plausible deniability’ to the co-accused merchant Mr Junaidy. In that conversation Mr Jeyapalasingham told Mr Krishnan that he had collected from the existing EFTPOS terminal at the merchant shop a copy of a transaction docket; that copy was to be utilised by the co-conspirators to manipulate the dummy EFTPOS machine so that it could print out sufficient material to satisfy the customer that the transaction on their individual cards had been accepted and was bona fide. Later the dummy terminal would effectively be programmed to produce a fraudulent receipt as close as possible in appearance to a legitimate receipt; it was for that reason Jeyapalasingham had obtained a legitimate receipt. Later that evening Jeyapalasingham then again contacted Krishnan and, amongst other things, told him ‘if this comes right, we’ll be able to pay off everything’.

The next day was 5 August 2011. The accused again contacted the unknown male in Canada and asked as to how the terminal could be programmed. He passed the phone to Baskaran and instructions were given by the Canadian male to Baskaran so as to adjust the settings upon the EFTPOS machine. That call demonstrates, I accept, Baskaran’s significant role as the technician in the enterprise. The accused later that day was observed in a real estate agency and around that time the lease was signed for the Harrow Road, Auburn property.

As regards to the establishment of the required ‘plausible deniability’ the co-conspirators had arranged for a person, only known to the authorities as ‘Hari’, to attend the Indian House shop. It was arranged that this person would be captured on the shop’s closed-circuit television; he would be shown to turn off the computer recording the movements inside the shop. It was necessary for Hari to sign employment forms to establish that he had been employed at the shop. Once those steps had been taken, should the authorities have been able to identify the dummy terminal used in the fraudulent transactions, the co-accused Mr Junaidy would blame the fraudulent conduct upon his fictitious employee ‘Hari’. The arrangements were that Hari would leave Australia before any of the fraudulent transactions were made on the accounts that had been compromised as a result of the use of the dummy terminal. Therefore he would not be available to be pursued by Australian police.

Co-accused Mr Krishnan’s principal role was in the procurement of the Indian student Hari. Krishnan was concerned about how Hari was to be paid; Jeyapalasingham spoke to him about that matter. He was concerned that Hari might run away with any money he was paid. Eventually Jeyapalasingham arranged with Krishnan that there would be a payment of $2,000 to Hari for doing the job and $1,000 to Krishnan for the introduction of Hari. Jeyapalasingham was to take $1,000 himself for that activity. There was discussion between Krishnan and Jeyapalasingham about Junaidy allowing for a week for the installation to occur and the payment of $20,000 to Junaidy on the basis that there would be ‘at least 300 card numbers harvested’.

Later that same day this accused spoke to Jeyapalasingham. The accused complained that the printed false receipt was ‘still coming out small’. Later the accused and Baskaran entered the Harrow Road address and their conduct within that unit was captured on the integrated recording device.

I am satisfied on the evidence tendered before me that the co-accused persons, including Jeyapalasingham, Krishnan and Junaidy, had many calls with each other trying to arrange the person Hari to turn up to the Indian House as a fictitious employee. There were also discussions as to how each of the parties would be paid. Late on 5 August 2011 Jeyapalasingham received a call from a person believed to be Mr Baig. He informed Jeyapalasingham that ‘no guy has been arranged yet’. There was conversation about continuing to search for a suitable person. There was discussion indicating that it was intended to set up the enterprise so that the finger of guilt would be pointed at the Indian student ‘Hari’. As Mr Baig said, ‘Without that guy we need someone to blame’. There were further discussions between them and the suggestion that ‘Hari’ would be offered $2,000 - $3,000. Jeyapalasingham told Mr Baig that ‘we are going to give him the fake ID’. The cost of obtaining fake identification was discussed; Jeyapalasingham said he could do it through a friend. On Saturday 6 August 2011, Jeyapalasingham spoke to Krishnan. Krishnan said that Junaidy was not happy with his agreed payment. There was a later discussion between them where Jeyapalasingham revealed that Junaidy may have another two or three locations where a compromised EFTPOS terminal could be installed. Krishnan arranged for a payment to himself as well.

Later that afternoon this accused and Jeyapalasingham discussed payments to Junaidy. This accused said he may be prepared to give Junaidy an extra $3,000 if the skimming operation was a success. He also said that he was prepared to pay $500 for a fake licence to be used by Hari; that is, amongst other things, the basis of the evidence in respect of count 4.

The next day on 7 August 2011 there were further conversations between the parties. Agreement was apparently reached that Junaidy would receive $25,000 and Krishnan $5,000.

On 8 August 2011 Baskaran called the unknown male in Canada. There was discussion about technical difficulties regarding the EFTPOS terminal. Baskaran complained that the software has a problem in that it is ‘not transferable’; that was said to relate to the printing of receipts. There was continued conversation between Thangavelautham and Baskaran which was recorded. Much of that was about utilising the boy Hari in the shop and that there was intended to be harvested between 50 and 100 credit or debit card numbers per day.

The next day, Tuesday 9 August 2011, the accused spoke with his co-accused Jeyapalasingham concerning Hari. He confirmed that ‘after five days we’ll get him the ticket’ referring to the air ticket for Hari to permanently leave Australia. Later that night the accused was observed by police to travel to the Win Mani Indian Supermarket in Merrylands and there he met with his brother Ravi. The purpose of that meeting was for the accused to receive $500 so as to pay Mr Jeyapalasingham for the false licence to be used by the person Hari. Thereafter, the accused telephoned Jeyapalasingham and said he had the $500 in cash for that licence. There were further conversations between them and it was agreed that the accused should put the money in a particular mailbox in Pendle Hill, which was at the residence of Jeyapalasingham. The accused undertook that task and at 9.19pm he spoke to Jeyapalasingham who acknowledged receipt of the $500.

The following day was 10 August. The accused on that day spoke to his brother and confirmed that he had paid money for the licence. He said to his brother that he may install the dummy EFTPOS terminal on the following Friday 12 August as it would take two days for the fake driver’s licence to be available for Hari. Later that morning Baskaran called the unknown Canadian male and informed him he had resolved the frequency issue with the machine.

In the early afternoon of 10 August Baskaran spoke to another male, unidentified and who was said to be overseas. He informed that male he had been practising on certain terminals prior to coming to Australia. He also stated that $100,000 could be made from the harvesting of 100 credit or debit card numbers. I accept the submissions of the prosecution that once the unlawful agreement is established the statements of the co-conspirators in pursuit of the aim of the conspiracy are admissible against each of the conspirators. Baskaran told the unidentified male that he was ready to do ‘a job’ but was waiting for ‘the boy’ to return. He also said that a group in Australia could make as much as $1 million equivalent in Australian currency, although he referred to Sri Lankan and Indian currency, from the installation of just one manipulated EFTPOS terminal. He also, understandably, advised that he did not want to be in Australia when the withdrawals upon the duplicate or fake cards were made.

Later that afternoon this accused called Jeyapalasingham who told him that he had obtained a photo of the boy Hari and was on his way to give it to the people whom he had organised to create the fake licence.

The next day was Thursday 11 August 2011. The co-accused Jeyapalasingham telephoned this accused and told him that he could not obtain that fake licence but had arranged an alternative transaction which would cost $800. He also stated he was continuing with organising Hari to bepaid $3,000. Later that evening Jeyapalasingham again telephoned this accused. He said he had not seen Hari face to face. He said that the boy was leaving his current job because of the money offered to him to participate in the conspiracy. This accused told Jeyapalasingham that he wanted to install the manipulated terminal the next day being Friday 12 August; clearly in the telephone call reference is made to Mr Junaidy’s Indian House grocery store as the location. This accused told Jeyapalasingham that he wanted Jeyapalasingham to personally speak to Hari. Jeyapalasingham said he would ""brainwash"" the boy.

The integrated device was recording the activities and conversations between this accused and Baskaran later that night. There was conversation between them about a computer terminal chip that could be used upon that EFTPOS machine. That conversation showed the knowledge of this accused concerning those chips which were said to be very valuable. The accused told Baskaran that a manufacturer of the chip could expect to make $200,000 to $300,000 from every 100 chips manufactured. The accused also revealed to Baskaran that he had chips in Australia and others in Canada and could arrange for his wife to send the chips to Australia. He also said that he wanted to acquire a transmitter with at least a 15 metre range. The benefit of that transmitter would enable this accused to capture the harvested data from the installed manipulated EFTPOS terminal. In that way the accused would not need to stand near the machine to download the harvested data. The accused said he had with him a transmitter with a range up to 50 metres which enabled him to sit in a car, nearby to the installed EFTPOS machine, and download its harvested credit or debit card data. The video shows the accused to be holding a blue coloured plastic bag; he describes to Baskaran the best way to dismantle the terminal so as to install the skimming device. Between them they discussed the importance of wearing gloves so as to avoid leaving fingerprints. They also discussed the removal of security stickers, the disarming of sensors and the use of specific tools and glue that were required to successfully complete the manipulation. There is discussion between them about their respective knowledge in that area. At one stage this accused says to Baskaran, ‘One wrong move or misbalance in your hand can result in total failure’. Later Baskaran, whilst working on the terminal, said, ‘If the wires touch each other then the terminal will sleep’, meaning it would no longer function. The prosecution relies on that captured video and audio as establishing significant technical knowledge in both this accused and the co-accused Baskaran to enable them to commit the alleged criminal offences.

The following day was Friday 12 August. Very early, just after midnight the previous day, the co-accused Baskaran called the unknown male in Canada. There were conversations about what components would be required to manufacture a chip for the ‘K23’ EFTPOS terminal. Thereafter this accused and Baskaran discussed technical aspects of manipulating EFTPOS terminals. This accused, captured on that integrated device, made a number of serious admissions against himself in my view. He said to Baskaran, ‘I organise for others to work for me and pay the money for jobs completed’. He also revealed he was planning to fly another person to Australia to assist him in the skimming operations. He explained as regards previous conduct that ‘the boys’ would be concerned that they would be captured on closed-circuit television cameras withdrawing money from automatic teller machines (‘ATM’). This clearly was referring to the use of the harvested material which would then be placed on cards to access ATMs and used to withdraw moneys from an account holder’s account. The accused revealed to Baskaran that he used to supply wigs to his boys and that they would swap those wigs each day. He said the boys would usually stay in Australia for two weeks; they would work only for five days and then depart to Malaysia or Singapore. They could return again to Australia if they were needed to withdraw money from ATMs utilising the skimmed data. I accept the Crown’s case that this conversation was clear evidence of the accused’s intention in relation to the conspiracy.

The conversation continued and the accused admitted to Baskaran that, ‘I myself have done ten lakh’. That refers to the equivalent of $1 million Australian dollars. ‘Lakh’ is said to be a currency that can be used in Sri Lanka and India. That $1 million exercise according to the accused took place in London. The accused added ‘I did not do it all by myself. Those numbers were given to me and I did the run-around. I never got into trouble. If we do the run-around with London numbers it does not concern the Canadians because it’s not a loss to them, however, the London people will be screaming. I myself have done 700 numbers in one day. I used to go there alone by myself and do it from morning to evening. It was all London numbers. I used to take out a lot’.

During the afternoon of 12 August 2011 the police continued to surveil this accused, Baskaran and the co-accused Jeyapalasingham. Later in the afternoon Jeyapalasingham, Baskaran and Thangavelautham met up with an unknown male. Later, again that afternoon, conversations between this accused and Baskaran were monitored on the integrated device at the address in Auburn. There was a conversation about programming into the terminal the shop name Indian House, along with the address, including ‘ANZ’ so that the machine would print that information on any receipt. During the course of that activity this accused was shown to be handing a credit card to Baskaran and giving him instructions as to ‘check what happens’; they discuss about the need for the innocent customers to type in a PIN number. There would then be printed the word ‘approved’ and a receipt would be printed out. A short time later the two are recorded comparing the receipt that they had just managed to print from the terminal with the original EFTPOS receipt supplied from the Indian House. They discuss about the printing of the sum of money to represent the transaction on that receipt. Having undertaken all that work this accused tells Baskaran that Junaidy, ‘won’t need anything else, we can just take it to the location’ to install it. This accused comments that the terminal is satisfactory and that the stand makes it look presentable.

As I have observed the Indian House grocery store is at 39 The Boulevarde, Strathfield. It is a small Indian convenience store / supermarket on the ground level of a two storey building. Enquiries with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission reveal that the co-accused Junaidy and another person are the directors of that business. There were four other Indian House stores in Sydney.

Later that evening at 7.15pm on Friday 12 August the accused is observed to be in the driver’s seat of a vehicle parked close to the Indian House supermarket. After some time the co-accused Junaidy exits that vehicle. He is shown to be carrying a blue plastic bag which contained a small box wrapped in cloth. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the blue plastic bag contained the manipulated EFTPOS terminal. Junaidy entered the shop. Later, police operatives observed Junaidy behind the counter serving customers and after some minutes they were able to photograph the blue plastic bag on the shop floor. Later that evening at about 10.06pm Jeyapalasingham speaks on the telephone with Junaidy. He asks him if ‘everything is okay?’ Junaidy replies, ‘everything okay, I did about four’. It is the Crown’s case, and I accept that submission, that the reference to doing ‘four’ is referring to Junaidy skimming successfully the credit or debit card data of four cards utilising the manipulated terminal. Jeyapalasingham tells Junaidy that the next day the man Hari will come to the shop. Junaidy only wants him to be there for five minutes. Jeyapalasingham then rings Thangavelautham to confirm that Junaidy has undertaken the skimming of four cards. Jeyapalasingham says, ‘Four brother’ and the accused replies in code ‘Four food, is it’ and Jeyapalasingham replies ‘yes’.

Later Junaidy telephoned Jeyapalasingham. He told him that there was a minimum of 120 customers a day during weekdays ‘so make sure you finish it in five days, on weekends I might get 200’. Jeyapalasingham stated, ‘we make 1,000 right?’. Junaidy confirmed that but said, ‘You have to be ready with money anytime’. Jeyapalasingham confirmed that ‘we need 1,000 brother’. Junaidy asked Jeyapalasingham to ‘make sure the guy is leaving the country’, referring to the person Hari. Jeyapalasingham then telephoned this accused and told him that Junaidy ‘told me to keep the cash ready, he will get us 1,000 in a week’. This accused replied, ‘Tell him we’ll pay him the money for 1,000’.

The following morning, Saturday 13 August 2013 there were a few further telephone communications between the alleged conspirators. Mr Krishnan asked Mr Jeyapalasingham, ‘Have you installed the thing’ and the reply was ‘It’s done’. Later Krishnan called to tell Jeyapalasingham that Hari’s mobile telephone was turned off. There were great efforts amongst the parties to ensure that Hari would attend the Indian House supermarket. There was a large number of telephone calls on the topic. Jeyapalasingham became more frustrated as the difficulties in ensuring Hari would attend the shop became apparent. At one stage Jeyapalasingham said to Krishnan, ‘He can’t even go there for half an hour, seriously, I will go and slap him on his ears. He’s fucking me over’. Jeyapalasingham becomes even more frustrated later. He has a telephone call with Hari. Hari told him it was not possible for him to go to the shop that Saturday because it was ‘the Rakhi festival’. Jeyapalasingham asked him to go just for ten minutes and Hari replied, ‘I don’t have interest actually’. Jeyapalasingham responds, ‘We have done the licence and everything you know, you just wasted our money and everything’. Hari said he would talk to another person before he went to the shop the next day. Jeyapalasingham then spoke with Krishnan and confirmed that Hari was saying he is not interested anymore. Jeyapalasingham says to Krishnan, ‘I am telling you now, I will definitely go and stab him and kill that dog’. In a later call to this accused Thangavelautham, Jeyapalasingham says that Hari is not interested in doing the job. He said that he had become angry and had said he would stab Hari with a knife. He added, ‘I am so angry now I will go and stab him with a knife and kill him’.

Later that day there were further communications between Mr Junaidy and Mr Jeyapalasingham; there were questions about when the boy would be turning up and how much Mr Junaidy would be paid. Later there was a conversation between this accused and Jeyapalasingham in which this accused said he would pay $25,000 on the Monday, that relating to a payment to Junaidy. In a later telephone conversation Junaidy said he would ‘not be doing it today’, referring to the job. There were further discussions between this accused and Jeyapalasingham about Hari withdrawing from his arrangement. Jeyapalasingham says that he will speak to Hari the next day and ‘if he does not agree then I will do something to him’. There were further discussions as to how they would carry out the exercise the following day.

Later that evening there were further conversations captured on the integrated surveillance device. This accused asked Baskaran for a demonstration of downloading the skimmed credit or debit card data. This accused said he was hoping to download that data every day. He said, ‘I was hoping to do it every day when he shuts the shop and bring it out with him. I was hoping to drive the car there and do it on a day-to-day basis’. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this accused was intending to download the illegally captured data from the terminal at the end of each day.

Sunday 14 August 2011 was the day that the police decided to bring the unlawful activity to an end and arrest the major participants. Police observed at 9.30am Junaidy opening the Indian House supermarket; later that morning he telephoned Jeyapalasingham. Junaidy said he wanted Hari to open the shop. He added, ‘I’m not feeling safe now’. He was hesitant about scanning any credit cards because Hari had not turned up. Jeyapalasingham instructed Junaidy that he should switch off the closed-circuit television cameras himself and then commence the skimming operation. But Junaidy replied in relation to Hari, ‘I don’t even have the declaration form yet’ referring to Hari’s employment. Later Jeyapalasingham rang Krishnan; again he threatened to stab Hari, adding ‘he won’t be able to go back to India, fucking dog, two busy days have been wasted’. There were further discussions between the participants concerning amongst other things the actual payments that would be made to Hari.

At 11.43am police observed a vehicle parked in Westmead. At that time Krishnan met this accused and Jeyapalasingham. Police approached that vehicle. There is other evidence to suggest that those persons were meeting so as to physically look for Hari, because in an earlier conversation that day Jeyapalasingham said to Krishnan ‘I will beat him up and send him to the hospital’. In any event, at 11.55am police decided to bring the matter to an end. They approached that vehicle to which I have referred, arrested this accused and the co-accused Jeyapalasingham and Krishnan. Police later arrested Baskaran at the Harrow Road address, having earlier arrested Junaidy at the Indian House supermarket.

Search warrants were executed on the Indian House supermarket and there was seized the manipulated VeriFone terminal. Examination of that terminal by Witham Laboratories, as evidenced by statements tendered before me, showed that the EFTPOS terminal appears to have been re-encoded with new software that enabled it to capture and to store or retain credit or debit card data as well as PIN data within its own internal memory. The preliminary examination revealed that the terminal had been also altered so it was not capable of communicating with any financial institution. Further, it was noted to be able to print receipts. That information was gained by using a Visa test card. The receipt identified the words ‘merchant copy, ANZ, date, time, receipt number, account number, the customer, the account, Indian House Strathfield’, and the word ‘approval’, ending with the words, ‘thank you’.

Mr Jamieson has given statements to the prosecution which were tendered before me. He is the technical manager at Witham Laboratories and he specialises in EFTPOS terminals. He examined the seized terminal. He said it showed no signs externally of being tampered with. By using a card it gave him the impression that it was operating normally and gave the ‘approved’ message. In Mr Jamieson’s opinion the program installed was designed for the capture of payment credit or debit card data. The machine … [would] pretend to communicate to the banking host and would always indicate that the transaction had been approved. I have taken into account all of Mr Jamieson’s statement - it has been the subject of some submissions.

Mr Jamieson used a password to reveal that seven sets of card data were upon the terminal. Two of those relate to the Visa test card he had used. The other data was later identified as being details of debit or credit cards using PIN issued to customers by Australian financial institutions. The bulk of the data that was downloaded was known as ‘Track 2 data’. That is the data that is required to profit from the harvesting of information.

Enquiries were then made with Australian financial institutions in relation to the data that was found upon the terminal. Two customers were identified as having shopped in the Indian House grocery store. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt their details were captured by the manipulated terminal when a transaction was undertaken, most likely, by Mr Junaidy.

Mr Jamieson also examined other material seized from Harrow Road in Auburn. There were five circuit board assemblies - their circuitry was designed for connection and use with magnetic stripe heads commonly used to read data. Each of them had connectors which would allow for interface with keypad underlays. He also found two wireless modem modules that were seized from Auburn and were designed for wireless communication of data.

That summarises the evidence. There was additional material, however, to which I should refer. The co-accused Junaidy has pleaded guilty and been sentenced by another Judge of this Court. He made an induced statement. I have read that tendered statement. In his statement Junaidy identifies this accused and the co-accused Mr Jeyapalasingham as having come to his shop and made offers in relation to the installation of a terminal. There was discussion about a payment of $20,000. Mr Junaidy states that he was in difficult financial straits at the time and he eventually, to his regret, agreed to their proposition. He confirmed the proposed use of the employee Hari. He identified photographs of himself, this accused and Jeyapalasingham. His statement comprehensively confirms the other material which I have summarised in the prosecution case.”

The conviction appeal


	
	The sole ground of appeal on conviction was that the verdict was unreasonable. To understand the basis on which this was said to be the case, it is necessary to refer to the particulars of the charges which were sought and given. On 14 May 2014 the applicant sought the following particulars from the Crown:
	


a.   In what way does the crown contend that the “persons unknown” would be defrauded. In other words, what was the object and the purpose of the conspiracy in the crown case. How does the crown say that loss would be incurred or interests put at risk?

b.   Although we recognise that the crown is not required to identify any particular victim with specificity, would you please provide greater detail of who are said to be the persons “unknown” either by class or some other identifiable feature.


	
	The following particulars were supplied:
	


a.    By deception, dishonestly obtaining the property belonging to another person/persons, namely the credit card particulars and PIN’s and/or obtaining a financial advantage or causing a financial disadvantage;

b.   Customers of the Indian House Grocery Store.


	
	The essence of the appeal was that the evidence left open the possibility that the object of the conspiracy was to on-sell the customers’ data once it had been harvested. The applicant submitted that such an agreement could not constitute a conspiracy to defraud.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the Crown particulars were underpinned by the possibility that either on-sale of the credit card information or use of the data personally was within the contemplation of the co-conspirators. He submitted that there was a reasonable possibility that the object of the conspiracy was simply to harvest the data, with the option for it to then be on-sold. He submitted a mere agreement to harvest data without more could not constitute a conspiracy to defraud. He submitted that where the prosecutor could not establish the object was anything other than the harvesting of information, and perhaps its on-sale for reward, there cannot have been an agreement to defraud any person.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant pointed out that the Crown case statement mirrored the particulars in that it stated the conspiracy either involved harvesting and on-sale or harvesting and use. The statement claimed:
	


“these cloned credit / debit cards are used both nationally and internationally to unlawfully withdraw funds from unknown persons’ accounts. Alternatively, the card data is sold on the international market for a substantial profit.”


	
	The applicant submitted, referring to R v LK [2010] HCA 17; 241 CLR 177 (LK) at [110] and R v Trudgeon (1988) 39 A Crim R 252 (Trudgeon) at 256, that the fact the parties to the agreement realised that the consequences of the agreed conduct might result in the performance of an unlawful act, or expected that the offence might take place, was insufficient to establish a criminal conspiracy. The applicant accepted that in the present case there may have been an expectation that the harvested information would be used for an unlawful purpose but submitted that such an expectation was insufficient to constitute the offence.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the mere obtaining of the information, namely credit card and EFTPOS card details, could not constitute a criminal conspiracy to defraud as there must be an economic interest which was put at risk. He submitted none was put at risk merely by an agreement to harvest such data.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that any risk to the customer did not materialise at the point of obtaining the information, although there may be a risk in the future. He submitted that the credit card data itself was not an economic interest. He submitted an economic interest was not affected until the data was in fact used.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant accepted that the use of the bogus ATM was deceptive and the obtaining of the credit card information was dishonest. However, he did not concede that the credit card information was property.
	
	
	In relation to the Crown’s reliance on a conversation between the applicant and one of his co-conspirators, to which I have referred below at [15], the applicant submitted that all it demonstrated was the possibility of an arrangement to use the cards in the future and did not establish the alleged conspiracy.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was not incumbent on it to prove there was an agreement to use the harvested data to clone the credit or debit cards and operate the accounts. It was submitted that the mere harvesting of the cards put the cardholders at risk of economic loss.
	
	
	The Crown stated that if that submission was not accepted, there was incontrovertible evidence by the applicant of his intention to use the data to create cloned cards and have people use them to access accounts. The Crown relied on the following intercepted telephone conversation between the applicant and an alleged co-conspirator, Sutharsan Baskaran to the following effect:
	


“‘And we also need people for us to stand and work out there.’

‘… I will bring people! I will do! I will give money! I will keep controlling!’

‘… local people here will be scared to run the local numbers here! … If it is London stuff or foreign stuff, there are fantastic guys here!’

‘… If the items are from here…Then, no one from here, will come to do…To do here no one will come! ... No one will come! No one will come. Because they are scared and the reason being that it will photograph … I have good things. I have wig.

… So when our people come, it will be like that for everyone.

… I have four wigs. So if one wig for you today, then a different one for the other person … so like that it will be rotated … So they will be wearing the wig and do it, and then come back! … They will do it! Our boys will not be scared. … They will … stay just for a week. They will stay for a week or two weeks when they come.’”

Disposition


	
	The circumstances in which this Court will set aside a verdict that is unreasonable are well established: See SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 40 at [11]-[14]; M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493-494. These principles have been held to apply equally to judge alone trials as to jury trials: FB v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 217 at [120].
	
	
	In the present case, the applicant contends that both the trial judge and this Court should have had a reasonable doubt as to whether the offence of defrauding a customer was intended by the co-conspirators as distinct from them holding an expectation that such defrauding would occur as a result of their admittedly deceptive and dishonest conduct.
	
	
	As the applicant pointed out, for the offence to be made out, it is necessary for the conspirators to have the intention to commit the offence in question: Gerakiteys v The Queen [1984] HCA 8; 153 CLR 317 at [8]; LK at [1], [64], [117]; Peters v The Queen [1998] HCA 7; 192 CLR 493 (Peters) at [66]. Further, it is not enough for the parties to have had an expectation that the offence would be committed. Thus in Trudgeon, where the relevant charge was conspiring to supply a prohibited drug, the prosecution failed because although there was an expectation that the appellant would on-sell the drugs, there was no agreement with his alleged co-conspirator that he would do so: at 254-255.
	
	
	In the present case, the applicant was charged with the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud. I have set out the particulars supplied by the Crown above at [5].
	
	
	In Peters, Toohey and Gaudron JJ made the following remarks in relation to a conspiracy to defraud:
	


“[24]   The contention of the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee fails, in our view, to pay sufficient regard to the elements of the offence of fraud. First, it overlooks the need for the use of dishonest means or, more precisely in the context of conspiracy to defraud, the need for there to be an agreement to use dishonest means. And it also pays insufficient regard to the consideration that fraud involves an element of dishonesty over and above the use of dishonest means. Before turning to these issues, however, it is convenient to direct attention to some matters which, if not mentioned, might result in other misunderstandings with respect to the offence of conspiracy to defraud.

[25]   The first matter which should be mentioned is that, contrary to what was said by Lord Diplock in R v Scott, the offence of conspiracy to defraud is not limited to an agreement involving an intention to cause economic loss, even where the intended victim is a private person. It has always been sufficient that the accused be aware that there is a risk of economic loss. And even where the victim is a private person, there may be cases of fraud which do not involve an intention to put another person’s economic interests at risk in any ordinary sense of that term. To take an example given by King CJ in R v Kastratovic, someone who believes that a person is indebted to him and that a defence which that person is genuinely asserting is without merit, nevertheless has an intention to defraud if he intends by dishonest means to deprive that other person of the opportunity of having the matter adjudicated.

[26]   Another matter which should be noted is that it is misleading to speak in terms of the purpose of a conspiracy to defraud, particularly as the purpose of the conspirators may be quite different from the fraud perpetrated. The purpose of conspirators is usually to obtain some financial advantage; the fraud, on the other hand, is in depriving others of their property or of the opportunity to protect their interests. And, as is pointed out in Archbold, the conspirators may never intend or, even, foresee the probability that others will suffer economic loss. Rather, they may genuinely believe that there will be no loss because their venture will be brought to a successful financial conclusion to the advantage of all concerned, even those whose interests have been put at risk.

…

[33]   As already explained, ‘dishonesty’ does not appear in the statute establishing the offence of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. But when properly analysed, the offence of conspiracy to defraud involves dishonesty at two levels. First, it involves an agreement to use dishonest means. Ordinarily, the means will be dishonest if they assert as true something which is false and which is known to be false or not believed to be true or if they are means which the conspirators know they have no right to use or do not believe that they have any right to use the means in question. And quite apart from the use of dishonest means, the offence involves an agreement to bring about a situation prejudicing or imperilling existing legal rights or interests of others. That, too, is dishonest by ordinary standards. If those matters are properly explained to a jury, further direction that the accused must have acted dishonestly is superfluous. Conversely, if those matters are not properly explained, a direction that the jury must be satisfied that the conspirators were dishonest is unlikely to cure the defect.”


	
	Whilst McHugh J described the offence in these terms:
	


“[73]   Although most cases of conspiracy to defraud involve an agreement to use dishonest means which has the effect of inflicting economic loss on a third party, the infliction of such loss is not an essential element of the offence. It is sufficient that the conspirators intended to obtain some advantage for themselves by putting another person's property at risk or depriving another person of a lawful opportunity to obtain or protect property. It is also well established that a conspiracy to defraud may be established if the defendants agree to deceive a person into acting or refraining from acting contrary to his or her public duty

[74]   Thus, in most cases, a conspiracy to defraud arises when two or more persons agree to use dishonest means with the intention of obtaining, making use of or prejudicing another person's economic right or interest or inducing another person to act or refrain from acting to his or her economic detriment. Exceptionally, a conspiracy to defraud will also arise when two or more persons agree to use dishonest means to induce a third person to act or refrain from acting in contravention of the third person's public duty. In some cases, it may be sufficient that the object of the agreement to use dishonest means concerns a non-economic right or interest of a person such as private reputation or personal status. But in the vast majority of cases, conspiracies to defraud concern rights or interests having an economic value.”


	
	In the present case, there can be no doubt there was an agreement to obtain the credit card details by means which were conceded to be deceptive and dishonest. Having regard to the conviction on Count 3, the means adopted by the alleged conspirators were plainly unlawful. It is also clear that the conspirators intended to obtain a financial advantage from the credit card details, whether by selling them or using the material to access the customers’ accounts.
	
	
	As was pointed out by Toohey and Gaudron JJ in the passage cited above (Peters at [33]), the offence involves an agreement to bring about a situation prejudicing or imperilling existing legal rights or interests of others. As McHugh J pointed out, it is sufficient that the conspirators intended to take some advantage to themselves by putting another’s property at risk or depriving a person of a lawful opportunity to obtain or protect property: See also Bolitho v Western Australia [2007] WASCA 102; 34 WAR 215 at [149] [152], [159]; R v Kastratovic (1985) 42 SASR 59 at 62.
	
	
	In the present case, there was an intention to affect customers’ economic interests or, to use the words of McHugh J in Peters, to deprive persons of a lawful opportunity to protect property. The taking of the credit card information put at risk the underlying accounts to which the cards related by providing the means for unauthorised access to those accounts. Put another way, the taking of the information deprived the credit card holders of the opportunity to protect their economic interests by keeping such information confidential, except in the case of authorised use.
	
	
	It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out. It is not necessary to deal with the alternative route by which the Crown suggests the same conclusion can be reached.
	
	
	In the result, leave to appeal against conviction should be granted but the appeal dismissed.
	


The sentence appeal


	
	The sentencing judge set out the following indicative sentences in respect of the counts on which the appellant was convicted:
	


Count 1:   11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months.

Count 2:   3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months.

Count 3:   4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years.

Count 4:   18 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 13.5 months.


	
	The sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months to date from 14 August 2011 and expiring on 13 November 2019, with the balance of the term expiring on 13 August 2022.
	


The grounds of appeal on sentence


	
	The grounds of appeal on sentence were as follows:
	


“2.   His Honour erred in failing to mitigate the appellant’s sentence, in view of the manner in which the trial was conducted.

3.   The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in the light of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender, Jeyapalasingham.

4.   The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.”

The remarks on sentence


	
	The sentencing judge set out in somewhat truncated form the conclusions he had reached in convicting the applicant. It is unnecessary to repeat what I have set out above. The sentencing judge stated that, having regard to the evidence, the applicant was set upon engaging in a conspiracy to defraud cardholders. He said that the applicant was not merely interested in setting up a dummy terminal at one store but at many.
	
	
	Relevantly, the sentencing judge considered the involvement of Mr Junaidy, the proprietor of the grocery store at which the terminal was installed. He concluded that Mr Junaidy was “a much lesser player” than the applicant in the conspiracy. In dealing with the financial gain the co-conspirators would obtain, he concluded they were all to be rewarded but none more so than the applicant.
	
	
	The sentencing judge referred to the fact that a single offence of obtaining advantage by deception would carry a maximum penalty of 10 years. He stated that that was something to which he could have regard in determining the penalty he should impose.
	
	
	The sentencing judge accepted that Mr Junaidy was financially vulnerable and had accepted the opportunity to make an easy $25,000. By contrast, he said, the offender was the mastermind of the conspiracy, coming to Australia to harvest substantial sums of money and to “create a degree of havoc within our commercial system”.
	
	
	The sentencing judge found the psychologist’s report tendered on behalf of the applicant of little assistance. He stated that no evidence had been called to support any of the information the psychologist had received.
	
	
	The sentencing judge described the aggravating factors in respect of the offence as its extraordinary degree of sophistication and the determination exhibited by the applicant as ringleader. He concluded that the restaurant in Strathfield was not the only potential site of operation. This conclusion was not challenged.
	
	
	The first ground of appeal was that a discount in sentence should be allowed for what was described as the applicant’s co-operation with the authorities. The sentencing judge rejected this submission in the following terms:
	


“It is submitted to me by Mr Lang that I should allow the offender a discount for his cooperation with the authorities. Mr Lange relies upon an authority in a different case. I cannot remotely consider that this offender cooperated with authorities. He chose, legally aided, to consent to the tender of the overwhelming amount of evidence that the prosecution had, but continued steadfastly to deny involvement in the offending behaviour. The evidence against him was overwhelming. I think it would be a nonsense to suggest that I should allow a discount for his cooperation with authorities which in my view is non-existent. There may be circumstances where a person has pleaded not guilty and can be said to require the determination of a particular issue by a Court; that person may well facilitate that determination by allowing tender of evidence. This is not such a case. The offender continues to not assist in relation to revealing his motivation. His motivation of course overwhelmingly is his financial advantage.”


	
	The sentencing judge described the applicant as the driving force behind the conspiracy. He referred to the fact that he arranged his entry into Australia under a false name and had overseas contacts which he used to obtain the ATM machine and arrange for its collection. The sentencing judge also referred to the fact that he “imported Baskaran”, the technician, and engaged Jeyapalasingham as a trusted lieutenant. The sentencing judge referred to the fact that he spoke of importing “boys” to operate the ATM machines to withdraw money and was prominent in organising the “plausible deniability” scheme by the employment of the student Hari. He stated this showed a very high level of planning and sophistication. He said the applicant’s conduct occurred over a period of time and he intended to steal a substantial sum of money from the Australian banking system. His Honour referred to the need for personal and general deterrence in relation to crimes of this nature and to statements in this Court that, generally speaking, this form of conduct must attract severe punishment.
	
	
	In relation to subjective features, the sentencing judge pointed to the fact that the applicant was 50 years of age. He stated he was cautious about accepting any evidence that the appellant’s wife and family in Canada had health problems.
	
	
	The sentencing judge took the view that the sentences should be concurrent as the activity in Counts 2, 3 and 4 was driven towards the successful carrying out of “the aims of the conspiracy”. Fixing a non-parole period, he found there was nothing to justify making a finding of special circumstances.
	


The sentencing of Jeyapalasingham


	
	Shortly prior to sentencing the applicant, the sentencing judge had sentenced the co-conspirator Mr Jeyapalasingham. Jeyapalasingham was in fact sentenced on two counts of conspiracy, both involving deceptive use of ATM machines. It was the second to which the applicant was a co-conspirator.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to set out the facts surrounding the first conspiracy in any detail. As the sentencing judge pointed out, it involved arrangements including the use of dummy ATM machines so as to obtain credit card data and utilisation of the information to make unauthorised withdrawals or obtain retail goods. There were also two matters taken into account on a Form 1 dealing with the proceeds of crime relating to the theft of various terminals.
	
	
	The second conspiracy was that which is the subject of the present appeal. In the course of his judgment the sentencing judge expressed the view that the applicant was clearly the ringleader at the Australian end. He stated, however, that Jeyapalasingham played an important role as a middleman between the applicant and the merchant Junaidy. The sentencing judge noted that Jeyapalasingham expected to obtain a substantial reward from the venture.
	
	
	The sentencing judge pointed to the fact that Jeyapalasingham had no previous criminal convictions. He noted he was aged 37 and had been in custody for more than three years, during which time he had not breached prison discipline and that the work which he had undertaken in prison augured well for his rehabilitation. The sentencing judge took into account the plea of guilty as an acknowledgement of his serious behaviour.
	
	
	After reviewing certain psychological evidence the sentencing judge concluded that, on balance, Jeyapalasingham had a psychological condition but was not satisfied it played any role in his decision to become involved in serious criminal conduct.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that although the applicant was the ringleader, Jeyapalasingham played a very important role in the conspiracy. He stated he was regularly liaising with the applicant, was communicating with the merchant and played a major role in seeking out the services of the student, Hari, including obtaining fake information for that person.
	
	
	In the result, taking into account the two Form 1 matters on the indictment charging the first conspiracy, the sentencing judge, after allowing a discount of 15 per cent for the plea of guilty, sentenced Jeyapalasingham to 3 years imprisonment. The sentencing judge found special circumstances and fixed a non-parole period of 2 years.
	
	
	In relation to the conspiracy the subject of this appeal, the sentencing judge again after applying a discount of 15 per cent for the guilty plea, fixed a sentence of 4 years and 3 months. Finding special circumstances he fixed a non-parole period of 2 years and 10 months.
	
	
	The sentencing judge then imposed an aggregate sentence of 6 years with a 4 year non-parole period.
	


The subsequent sentencing of the applicant


	
	Subsequent to the applicant being sentenced for the offence the subject of this appeal, he was sentenced on three counts of obtaining money by deception contrary to s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Crimes Act). The offence carried a maximum penalty of 5 years with no standard non-parole period. The offence involved obtaining credit card account details from an ATM at a Mobil service station which were used at various ATMs. Count 1 involved the use of 32 different cards at an ANZ ATM at Burwood. The total amount taken was $26,260. Count 2 involved similar activity at an ATM at Penrith. A total of $14,000 was obtained from 18 cards. The third count involved the use of 27 different cards at a Penrith ATM, the amount taken totalling $10,460.
	
	
	The offences all took place prior to the offence the subject of the present appeal. The offences were committed between 14 February 2009 and 20 February 2009, the same dates on which the applicant arrived in and departed from Australia. There was also another matter on a Form 1. In total, an amount of $80,370 was withdrawn over a six day period utilising 110 card numbers.
	
	
	In sentencing the applicant, the sentencing judge Garling ADCJ, recognised that in applying the totality principle he had to take into account the sentence imposed in the present proceedings. He stated that the penalties he would have imposed but for taking that sentence into account were terms of imprisonment of 3 years on Count 1 and 2 years and 6 months on each of Counts 2 and 3 with a non-parole period in accordance with the Act on each count. He stated that he would have made the sentences concurrent. He indicated that having regard to the principle of totality, he would impose the same head sentences but fix a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 13 November 2019.
	
	
	In the result, the applicant was sentenced on Count 1 to a term of 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year to date from 13 November 2019 and in respect of Counts 2 and 3 to terms of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year to date from 13 November 2019. The applicant was thus eligible to be considered for release to parole on 12 November 2020.
	


The first ground: His Honour erred in failing to mitigate the applicant’s sentence in view of the manner in which the trial was conducted


	
	At the trial the applicant made no admission, nor did he indicate at any time prior to closing address the reason he was said to be not guilty of the charge. This is not to be critical of this approach. It is one which the applicant was entitled to take.
	
	
	It is correct that the applicant did adopt an approach which limited the factual issues in dispute, avoiding the need to strictly prove documents such as the content of telephone intercepts or the calling of witnesses. Such an approach, which with respect was sensible and did no damage to the applicant’s case, is to be encouraged.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the trial was run on a narrow issue. However, as the Crown pointed out in its submissions, it was required to tender a large body of material as the issues in question were not identified at the outset of the proceedings. This is made clear by the comment of the judge in his sentencing remarks:
	


“In the course of an exchange between bench and bar table I invited Mr Lange to make a submission as to what the purpose of the activities of the conspirators was, if it were not to defraud persons unknown; he declined that invitation. I therefore went away and read all the evidence…”


	
	The applicant relied on various authorities where the manner in which a trial was conducted was taken into account as part of the sentencing process. In R v Doff [2005] NSWCCA 119; 54 ACSR 200, the Court exercised its residual discretion to decline to intervene where error had been established on a Crown appeal, citing as one of the reasons the efficient way the trial was conducted, which whilst not demonstrating contrition or remorse did show a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. The Court said it did not see why it should not be taken into account for the purpose of sentencing: at [58](c).
	
	
	In R v Nguyen & Luong [2011] NSWSC 562, McCallum J applied the same principle. Her Honour made the following remarks at [44]:
	


“The Crown acknowledged that the hearing was shortened as a result of concessions made by [the accused] at his trial which reduced the number of witnesses required to give evidence in the trial and enabled a deal of technical evidence to be adduced in short-hand fashion. That is a factor which, whilst not demonstrating contrition or falling strictly within the wording of section 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, shows a willingness to facilitate the course of justice and is appropriately taken into account for the purpose of sentencing.”


	
	I agree that there are cases where the conduct of the offender facilitates the course of justice in a manner which can be taken into account in the sentencing process. However, it is not mandatory that it be taken into account and the extent that it warrants consideration must always be a matter for the sentencing judge.
	
	
	In the present case, the sentencing judge acknowledged that there were circumstances where the manner in which cases were conducted facilitated the course of justice. However, His Honour determined, for the reasons I have set out above at [36], that this was not such a case. Although minds might differ on whether it was an appropriate case to allow a discount for the manner in which the trial was conducted, I do not think that the sentencing judge fell into error in reaching that conclusion.
	
	
	It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2: The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in light of the sentence which was imposed on the co-offender, Jeyapalasingham


	
	I have summarised above the remarks on sentence made by the sentencing judge in sentencing the applicant and Mr Jeyapalasingham.
	


The submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that the indicative sentence imposed on Jeyapalasingham for the conspiracy for which the appellant was sentenced was 5 years prior to the 15 per cent discount for the plea of guilty. In addition, it should be noted that the non-parole period in the case of the sentence imposed on Jeyapalasingham was fixed at 66 per cent of the head sentence compared to 75 per cent in the case of the applicant.
	
	
	It was submitted that the disparity was one which would give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance in the sense described in the authorities: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 301, 309, 323; Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 (Green & Quinn) at [28], [30]-[33].
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant accepted that it was necessary to consider the aggregate sentence rather than the indicative sentences. However, he pointed to the fact that in the present case the sentences on the other three counts on which the applicant was convicted were to be served concurrently. In these circumstances, he submitted, it was appropriate to look at the sentence for the conspiracy charge in isolation.
	
	
	The Crown emphasised it was necessary to have regard to the aggregate sentence imposed. It was submitted that the sense of grievance necessary to warrant appellate intervention is to be assessed by objective criteria and the Court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between the offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part that each has played in the relevant criminal conduct. The Crown pointed to the fact that the sentencing judge was fully aware of the sentences imposed on the co-offenders.
	
	
	The Crown identified the following differences between the position of the applicant and that of Jeyapalasingham which, it was submitted, justified the differences in sentence. First, the applicant played overwhelmingly the major role in the criminal conduct and was “at the pinnacle of the hierarchy of this particular group”. By contrast he found that Jeyapalasingham’s contribution was less than that of Baskaran, the technician, although not much less. The Crown pointed to the fact that Jeyapalasingham had the benefit of no criminal record, whilst the applicant had some prior convictions which were not said to be an aggravating factor.
	
	
	The Crown also pointed to the fact that the sentencing judge found that Jeyapalasingham suffered from a psychological condition, although it did not play any role in his decision to engage in the conspiracy. By contrast, he found that the applicant did not suffer from any such condition. The Crown also pointed to the age difference between the two offenders.
	
	
	The Crown also noted that the two offences on the Form 1 for Jeyapalasingham were similar to Counts 2 and 4 for which the applicant was charged whilst, unlike the applicant, Jeyapalasingham was not charged with the offence of possessing equipment to make a false document to commit forgery.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the Crown submitted the difference in sentence was not such as to establish the basis for appellate intervention.
	


Disposition


	
	The Crown was correct in stating that it was necessary to have regard to the aggregate sentence in considering this ground of appeal: JM v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 297 (JM) at [40]. However, as was pointed out in that case, the indicative sentences may be a guide to whether the aggregate sentence is excessive.
	
	
	Further, as was pointed out in Green & Quinn at [30], when sentences are compared, it is not a necessary condition to the application of the principle that the charges be formally identical. This is notwithstanding the significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentence of participants in the same criminal enterprise where they have been charged with different crimes.
	
	
	Similarly, the principle cannot be ignored, notwithstanding the difficulties involved, in the case of aggregate sentences involving not only the same crimes but separate crimes which the persons whose sentences are being compared have committed
	
	
	In the present case, each of the applicant and Jeyapalasingham were convicted of the same conspiracy. Two of the other three offences for which the applicant was convicted were of the same nature as those on the Form 1 for Jeyapalasingham, which was taken into account when sentencing him on the first conspiracy to which he pleaded guilty. Jeyapalasingham was given separate indicative sentences for each conspiracy but the totality principle led to a reduction in the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it does not seem to be inappropriate to compare the respective indicative sentences for the conspiracy in dealing with the application of the parity principle. At the same time, it must be taken into account that the aggregate sentence imposed on the applicant included sentences for three further counts (albeit to be served concurrently); that the aggregate sentence imposed on Jeyapalasingham included a sentence for a further conspiracy; and that the aggregate sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years imposed on him was reached after concluding the appropriate indicative sentences were 3 years for the first conspiracy and 4 years and 3 months for the conspiracy the subject of the present appeal.
	
	
	The following matters can be noted. First, without allowance for the discount for the plea of guilty, the difference between the indicative sentence for the offence the subject of the appeal was 5 years for Mr Jeyapalasingham compared to 11 years for the applicant. Second, the total sentence for Mr Jeyapalasingham was 6 years, including the additional conspiracy, compared to 11 years for the applicant, including the sentences for the charges which were to be served concurrently. Further, a finding of special circumstances was made in the case of Jeyapalasingham resulting in a non-parole period of 66 per cent in respect of each indicative sentence and in respect of the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	It seems to be that comparing these sentences would have left the applicant objectively with a justifiable sense of grievance. It is undoubtedly correct that the applicant was the ringleader and driving force in what was a sophisticated criminal undertaking. As such, it was appropriate that he received a significantly more severe sentence than Jeyapalasingham. Further, as I indicated, there were some subjective factors in the case of Jeyapalasingham which were not present in the case of the applicant, in particular that his conduct in prison augured well for his prospect of rehabilitation.
	
	
	However, taking these matters into account it does not seem to me that the disparity in sentence was warranted. Although the applicant was the ringleader in the conspiracy, Jeyapalasingham was by no means a minor player. He played an important role, particularly in the dealings with the merchant at whose premises the fraud was committed and in procuring the student to be used to establish the plausible deniability defence and obtaining a false identification for him. Further, as the primary judge found, he liaised on a regular basis with the applicant. Nor do I think the extent of the disparity can be justified by comparison of the aggregate sentences which included additional crimes in each case.
	
	
	In sentencing the applicant, the sentencing judge made no reference to the sentence he imposed on Jeyapalasingham and did not consider the question of parity in that context. In my opinion, he was in error in failing to do so. This ground of appeal has been made out.
	


Ground 3: The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive


	
	Because of the view I have formed on Ground 2, this ground can be dealt with relatively briefly.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that although the penalty for the common law offence of conspiracy was at large, the proper approach, generally speaking, was to have regard to the penalty imposed for the substantive offence: See for example Auimatagi v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 248; 216 A Crim R 179 at [4]; Tuifua v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 224; 189 A Crim R 1 at [2]. He submitted that the relevant substantive offence in the present case was obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to s 192E of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years.
	
	
	The applicant accepted that in exceptional cases the element of concert may justify a more severe penalty for conspiracy than the penalty imposed for the substantive offence. He referred to R v Hoar [1981] HCA 67; 148 CLR 32 at 38. That case involved a conspiracy to commit a large number of illegal fishing offences which justified a larger penalty than the maximum for a single substantive offence. The applicant submitted that, unlike that case, because of the intervention of the authorities, the object of the conspiracy was never fulfilled and the sentence was thus not required to reflect a multiplicity of offending.
	
	
	The applicant also referred, without elaboration, to judicial statistics which he submitted demonstrated the sentence imposed was not only the greatest sentence imposed for a conspiracy to defraud but exceeded the next most severe sentence by a considerable margin.
	
	
	In my opinion, notwithstanding these submissions, the sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive in the sense of unreasonable or plainly unjust or so far outside the range of sentences available that there must have been an error in its imposition: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [58]-[60].
	
	
	The sentence imposed was imposed on the applicant as the ringleader of a sophisticated conspiracy involving the importation of both personnel and materials and which, according to the Crown case statement, which was admitted without objection at the trial, had as his object to obtain details of the data of 1,000 customers. Although this attempt was foiled, it does not lessen the seriousness of what was intended to be achieved by the conspiracy. It certainly does not require that the applicant be sentenced by reference to a single offence under s 192E of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The scheme also involved the recruitment of the merchant, Mr Junaidy and the Indian student, Hari, who was to be blamed for the fraudulent conduct after he had departed for India.
	
	
	Conspiracies of this nature not only have the potential to cause serious financial hardship and embarrassment to a large number of consumers but also have the capacity to undermine confidence in this country’s financial system. It is imperative that in this context, any sentence reflects the need for general and specific deterrence. As the sentencing judge pointed out, this was the approach taken by the Court of Appeal of Western Australia in Tomov v The Queen [2011] WASCA 189. The need for severe punishment for offences of this nature has also been recognised by this Court and the Court of Appeal of Victoria: R v Araya [2005] NSWCCA 283; 155 A Crim R 555 at [96]-[98]; R v Harrower [1999] VSCA 182 at [10].
	
	
	Further, the statistics provided are of no assistance. In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [304], it was held that, although past sentences are no more than a historical statement of what has happened in the past, they can provide guidance and act as a yardstick against which to measure a proposed sentence: see also Hili at [54]. However, there can be no real guidance when the offences are different in nature to the particular offence being considered. The mere fact that the offence has involved a conspiracy to defraud does not provide such a comparison. No submission was made as to why the sentences referred to in the statistics provide a yardstick to measure the present sentence.
	
	
	The primary judge’s findings as to the subjective features of the applicant are not in contest. They do not provide a basis for any significant mitigation of the sentence.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the sentence was not manifestly excessive. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Resentencing


	
	Having regard to the conclusion I have reached on Ground 2 of the sentence appeal, it is necessary to resentence the applicant. The task for the Court in the present circumstances is to re-exercise the sentencing discretion to determine whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [40]-[43].
	
	
	I have set out the reasons why I consider the offence objectively serious in dealing with the manifestly excessive ground and it is not necessary to repeat those observations. Further, there is nothing before the Court to indicate there was any error in the assessment by the sentencing judge of the subjective features pertaining to the applicant. Indeed, the material before the Court indicates that, since he was sentenced for the present offence, he has been sentenced for three offences of the same nature, which took place prior to the offence the subject of the present appeal.
	
	
	However, the sentence imposed on Jeyapalasingham needs to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for the applicant. It is appropriate, in my opinion, that a significantly greater sentence be imposed on the applicant than was imposed on his co-offender to take into account the fact that the applicant was the ringleader and guiding force behind the conspiracy. However, the disparity between his sentence and that imposed on Jeyapalasingham has at least in part been ameliorated by the application of the totality principle by Garling ADCJ in the subsequent sentencing of the applicant: see above at [50]-[51].
	
	
	Taking all those factors into account, I am of the view that the sentence imposed on the applicant should be for a term of imprisonment of 9 years and 8 months. Like the trial judge, I am unable to find special circumstances. It follows that a non-parole period of 7 years and 3 months should be imposed. The commencement date for the sentence imposed on the applicant by Garling ADCJ should be varied such that it commences from the expiration of the non-parole period for the present offence.
	
	
	I should add that in reaching that conclusion I have taken into account the manner in which the applicant conducted his trial. However, I consider no further reduction in sentence should be granted to allow for that fact.
	
	
	No suggestion was made that the indicative sentences for the other counts on which the applicant was convicted were inappropriate or that those sentences should not be concurrent with a sentence for the conspiracy offence.
	


Orders


	
	In the result I would make the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal against conviction.
	
	
	Appeal against conviction dismissed.
	
	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	Appeal against sentence allowed.
	
	
	Set aside the sentences imposed on the applicant by Charteris DCJ and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 9 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 7 years and 3 months to date from 14 August 2011 and to expire on 13 November 2018 with a balance of term to expire on 13 April 2021.
	
	
	Vary the commencement date of the sentences imposed on the applicant by Garling ADCJ on 14 September 2015 to 13 November 2018.
	
	
	The applicant will be eligible to parole on 13 November 2019.
	



	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Bathurst CJ and the orders which he proposes. While I agree with RS Hulme AJ that there is a clear distinction between the role of the applicant and that of Jeyapalasingham in the offending in that the role of the applicant was substantially more important, I am of the opinion that the difference in their sentences is so great as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant.
	
	
	R S HULME AJ: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice. I agree with his Honour that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. I agree also that grounds 2 and 4 in support of the application to appeal against sentence fail. I agree with the reasons the Chief Justice has advanced for these conclusions.
	
	
	I am however, unable to agree that the sentence imposed on the Appellant should be reduced because of any disparity with the sentence imposed on the co-offender Jeyapalasingham.
	
	
	Credit card fraud and the taking of other peoples’ identities is a major problem. Large amounts are at stake and the offending is often difficult to detect or at least detect in a fashion enabling offending to be punished. Financial institutions and other members of the community are obliged to spend very large sums of money in attempts to forestall activities such as that in which the Appellant was engaged.
	
	
	The account of the Appellant’s activities set forth in the Chief Justice’s judgment demonstrates what can only be described as a very carefully thought out and sophisticated operation of which he was the ring leader and which he travelled half-way around the world to set up. His aim was to defraud hundreds if not thousands of people and by doing so profit to the extent of hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars. The sentencing judge described the Appellant’s intention as “to harvest an unlimited amount of cash from ATM machines”.
	
	
	Mr Jeyapalasingham, while very active and, in the words of the sentencing judge, played a “very important role” was a “trusted underling” and “trusted lieutenant” and well below the entrepreneurial level of the Appellant. There is no evidence as to Mr Jeyapalasingham’s intended reward but nothing to suggest it would have approached that of the Appellant.
	
	
	The indicative sentence for Jeyapalasingham in respect of his involvement in the Appellant’s offending of 4 years and 3 months after a 15% discount for Jeyapalasingham’s plea reflects a pre-discount figure of 5 years. I accept that there is a very considerable gap between this and the 11 years full term imposed on the Appellant and that the same may be said of the respective non-parole figures of 40 months (pre-discount) and the 8 years 3 months imposed on the offenders albeit the gap is relatively less in a comparison of the aggregate sentences imposed. However, given the difference in their roles I am a long way from being persuaded that this disparity is unjustified.
	
	
	But even if I were persuaded that there was unjustified disparity I would not interfere so as to reduce the Appellant’s sentence. As I have indicated the rewards the Appellant hoped to achieve were huge and, but for the intervention of the police, may well have been achieved. In remarks not the subject of challenge in the appeal the sentencing judge observed:
	


… credit card skinning is a significant problem in our community’s commercial life;

I accept that the offending behaviour does strike at public confidence in the use of ATM machines. The misuse of credit card information has the potential to undermine public confidence in our banking system; credit and debit cards are a much used tool of modern commerce and banking;

Our society operates now by the use of credit and debit cards; it is an integral part of how we do business;

and quoted with approval remarks in Tomov v R [2011] WASCA 189 at [88]:-

International criminals and gangs and their agents … must be deterred from choosing Australia or anywhere to commit offences of this kind, especially having regard to their boss's evident access to quality equipment and the ease with which financial offences can be committed and identity fraud committed. The integrity of Australia's sovereignty, financial systems and personal financial security are all genuinely put at risk by this kind of offending.


	
	With all of these remarks I agree.
	
	
	The Chief Justice has drawn attention to the decision of the High Court in The Queen v Hoar [1981] HCA 67; 148 CLR 32. At p39, a majority of the High Court observed:-
	


Although the principle is that the penalty for conspiracy to commit an offence should not as a rule exceed the penalty fixed for that offence - see Verrier (1967) 2 AC, 195 - the Court must take into account the number of offences which are the object of the conspiracy. If the conspiracy is to commit but one offence, and Verrier was such a case, then the penalty to be imposed for conspiracy should not in general exceed the maximum penalty for the commission of the substantive offence. If, however, the conspiracy is to commit a number of offences then the Court for the purpose of the principle will have regard to the maximum penalty that can be imposed in respect of those offences.


	
	To gain the rewards that he contemplated, the Appellant’s intention here was that innumerable offences would be committed. Judged by the magnitude of his offending and the need for general deterrence, I would regard any lesser sentence than he received as manifestly inadequate and exercise the discretion which this Court has in the case of appeals on parity grounds – see Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [33] - not to reduce the sentence imposed.
	
	
	In the result, I agree with orders (1)–(3) proposed by the Chief Justice but would dismiss the appeal against sentence. The consequence is that orders (5)–(7) proposed by his Honour are unnecessary and should not be made.

		20 July 2016",2016-07-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2428500,R v Settree (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 1079,"judgment


	
	The accused, Scott Settree has pleaded not guilty to both counts on the indictment that, at 8 pm on 3 December 2014 he murdered his parents, Margaret Settree and Donald Ian Settree. An election under s 132(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) was made on 26 July 2016. This election was consented to by the Crown on the same date, and the orders providing for an extension of time to make the election and for a judge alone hearing were made on 27 July 2016: R v Settree [2016] NSWSC 1028.
	
	
	It has been made clear by Mr Wilson SC, who appears for Mr Settree, that the not guilty pleas have been entered to reflect a defence of mental illness that Mr Settree says is available to him. Criminal trials are said to be both accusatory and adversarial. In the latter sense, it is for the parties, not the Court, to choose the ground on which the trial will be fought. The Court is bound to accept the issues for determination as defined by the parties. I mention this consideration at the outset to record that the Crown accepts that the defence is available.
	
	
	The accused is also charged with possessing a prohibited firearm without license or permit. This charge relates to the murder weapon, a 12 gauge pump-action shotgun. The offence is said to have occurred at about the same time as the murders and, as is obvious, is related to them. The Crown elected to prosecute this charge on indictment. Notwithstanding the mental illness issue to which I have referred, there is no question that Mr Settree is fit to plead and stand trial. He pleaded guilty to the firearms charge at the first available opportunity in the Local Court and was committed for sentence in accordance with Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Mr Settree adheres to his guilty plea.  I will deal with the firearm matter separately after the giving of these reasons and the return of my verdict.
	


The Accused’s formal admissions under s 184 Evidence Act 


	
	There is no real dispute as to the facts of the case. Both Counsel for the defence Eric Wilson SC and Crown Prosecutor, Eric Balodis of counsel, submit that the defence of mental illness is made out. Additionally, at the commencement of the trial Mr Settree made a number of formal admissions pursuant to s 184 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). These admissions were contained in a document dated 27 July 2016. Having satisfied myself as to the requirements of subs (2), I admitted the document into evidence as Exhibit 1. I have set out the admissions in full in the next paragraph. Mr Settree admits that he shot his parents deliberately; notwithstanding his mental illness defence, with the intention of killing them; and that they died from the gunshot wounds he inflicted.
	
	
	The admissions in full are as follows:
	


“On the 27th of July 2016, the accused, SCOTT SETTREE, on the advice of his counsel, makes the following formal admissions:

1. The deceased, Margaret Settree, died on the 3rd December 2014.

2. The deceased, Donald Ian Settree died on the 3rd December 2014.

3. Both of the deceased died as a result of injuries sustained when they were shot at and struck by projectiles discharged from a shot gun.

4. The death of Margaret Settree was caused by her being shot once and struck by shot gun projectiles on the left side of her neck at 45 Bourke Street Cobar New South Wales.

5. The death of Donald Ian Settree was caused by him being shot twice and struck by the shot gun projectiles on the left side of his chest and the right side of his head at 45 Bourke Street Cobar New South Wales.

6. I Scott Settree state that I caused the death of Margaret Settree by discharging on one occasion a loaded shot gun at her.

7. I admit that at the time I fired the loaded shot gun at Margaret Settree it was my intention to kill Margaret Settree.

8. I Scott Setttree stat that I caused the death of Donald Ian Settree by discharging a loaded shot gun at him on two occasions.

9. I admit that at the time I fried the loaded shot gun on two occasions at Donald Settree it was my intention to kill Donald Ian Settree.”


	
	Subject to the mental illness defence, these admissions would be sufficient to justify Mr Settree’s conviction for each murder. It follows that the only issue for determination is whether Mr Settree has that mental illness defence available.
	


Summary of events of 3 December 2014


	
	The facts I am about to narrate are not disputed. Mr Settree shot his mother and then his father in the home he shared with them in Cobar at about 8.30 pm on 3 December 2014. The shootings seem to have been precipitated by a minor domestic disagreement of the type most people would be able to brush off, even allowing for the resentment that can build up in family relationships over grievances perceived to be unaddressed. This disagreement was about Mr Settree drinking a bottle of his father’s wine without permission. This domestic offence occurred the previous evening. When his father remonstrated with him about it on the evening of 3 December 2014, Mr Settree became angry, left the house and went to the bank, where he withdrew $40, being the value of the wine, at 8.10 pm. He returned home still clearly angry and said to his father, “there’s your $40 stick it up your arse”. Mr Settree then started to throttle his father, but promptly released his grip, saying “You’re not worth it”. Ian (as he preferred) Settree complained to his wife, Margaret Settree, who then told Mr Settree to “get out of my house, go, pack your things and get out”.
	
	
	The accused went to his bedroom where he obtained his pump action shotgun from his cupboard. He carried the gun from the bedroom. When he reached the threshold, he saw his mother standing in the lounge room, and shot her in the neck. He later told police that he experience a sensation of relief. He reloaded the weapon by its pump-action and approached his father. Mr Ian Settree screamed and put his hands up, I infer, indicating “don’t shoot”. But his son raised the gun and shot his father twice, in the chest and head. The accused told investigating police that once again he felt a feeling of relief and release.
	
	
	After the shootings the accused went back to the local hotel where he had been drinking earlier in accordance with his normal routine. He must have arrived not long after 8.30 pm. He sat in a different part of the bar from usual. The publican, Ashleigh Bellotti, a retired police officer, served him a schooner of beer. The accused said to him, “Ash, Ash, I have to tell you something... just done the most stupid thing in my life”. After further inquiry by Mr Bellotti, the accused told him that he had shot his parents. Mr Bellotti then noticed bloodstains on the trousers of the accused; he informed him that he was going to call the police and asked him where the weapon was. The accused told him that it was on the kitchen table.
	
	
	While waiting for the police to arrive, the accused told Bellotti how he had used the shotgun: “I walked into my bedroom, pulled the gun out of my closet, walked back into mum and dad, shot mum in the neck and shot dad twice.” The accused was subsequently arrested and taken to Cobar Police Station.
	
	
	The police found Margaret Settree on the floor in the lounge room, with a neck wound, and Ian Settree in the hallway on the floor, similarly in a pool of blood. Both were deceased. A pump action shot gun was found on the dining room table.
	
	
	Both expert psychiatrists Dr Samuels and Dr Nielssen are of the opinion that the accused at the time could not think rationally about his conduct due to a disease of the mind such that he could not determine right from wrong.
	


General legal principles


	
	Section 133 Criminal Procedure Act prescribes my duties in a criminal trial without a jury. The section requires me to include in my judgment the principles of law and findings of fact I have relied on in reaching my decision. The section also requires me to take into account any warning which, in the circumstances of the case at hand, would usually be given to a jury.
	
	
	I bear in mind that I have the responsibility of identifying the real issues for decision. It is necessary for me to state only so much of the law as is relevant to those issues: Alford v Magee (1952) 85 CLR 437 at 466.
	
	
	The starting point, and fundamental rule, as in any criminal trial, is that Mr Settree is presumed to be innocent. It is relevant to record, given his plea, that he is also presumed to be sane. The presumption of innocence is rebutted if, and only if, the Crown proves the essential elements of the charge beyond reasonable doubt. It is for the accused to rebut the presumption of sanity by establishing his mental illness defence on the balance of probabilities, a much less exacting standard of proof.
	
	
	Particular considerations as to the proper analysis to be adopted apply to this case because Mr Settree has raised mental illness as a defence: Hawkins v The Queen [1994] HCA 28; 179 CLR 500; R v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 226; 63 NSWLR 490 at [32]. Those considerations relate to the order in which the issues are required to be approached. As Mr Wilson SC, who appears for Mr Settree, and the learned Crown Prosecutor Mr Balodis accepts, the better view on the authorities is that the issues are to be approached in the order which I will now set out.
	
	
	The first issue is whether the shooting of Margaret and Ian Settree by the accused with the shotgun were deliberate acts. Mental illness is irrelevant at this stage.
	
	
	There is no issue that the actions of the accused against his mother and father were willed and voluntary; he has admitted this (Exhibit 1). Neither counsel submit that I should find otherwise, and indeed the nature of the injuries could not support any other conclusion.
	
	
	The second issue is whether Mr Settree is criminally responsible for the consequences of his actions. This involves resolution of the mental illness defence. If I am not persuaded that the mental illness defence is available it will be necessary to consider the partial defence of substantial abnormality of the mind.
	
	
	The mental illness defence is governed by the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW). Section 38 provides for a “special verdict” if the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness. This is a third category of available verdict in addition to verdicts of “guilty” or “not guilty”. It is not the same as an acquittal. The legal consequences which follow a special verdict “are quite different from those which follow a plain verdict of not guilty on the ground that [Mr Settree] did not do the things charged” (The King v Porter [1933] HCA 1; 55 CLR 182 at 185).
	
	
	If I return a special verdict, I am empowered to order that Mr Settree be detained “in such place and in such manner” as I think fit “until released by due process of law” (s 39 of the Act). I am not authorised to release Mr Settree into the community unless I am satisfied that his safety, or the safety of any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by his release (s 39). A decision that he be detained in custody means that he will be a forensic patient under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, which will review his case every six months and make the necessary orders for his continued detention, care and appropriate treatment. The Mental Health Review Tribunal is presided over by a senior lawyer who may be a retired judicial officer. It has two other members, one of whom is a psychiatrist and the other a respected member of the community suited to the task by reason of qualification or experience.
	
	
	The Tribunal may not release Mr Settree unless it is satisfied as required by law about his safety and the safety of members of the public. And it may only do so after it has given the Minister for Health and the Attorney General prior opportunity to make submissions about his possible release. The Tribunal will be bound to review Mr Settree’s case, at least every six months. Importantly, in this case, whilst under its supervision, the Tribunal may make orders for Mr Settree’s continued detention, care or treatment in a hospital or a prison.
	
	
	I emphasise that the return of a special verdict will not mean that Mr Settree has not perpetrated what is the greatest wrong that may be committed according to the ordinary standards adopted by reasonable people; rather the law does not attribute criminal responsibility to him for it by reason only of his mental illness.
	
	
	Not every case of mental illness is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the mental illness defence absolving a person from criminal responsibility. Everyone would regard murder as a heinous crime. Everyone would regard killing your mother and your father as heinous and unnatural. However, because of the presumption of sanity, I may not reason from this latter consideration that because the accused committed such an unnatural act, he must have been mentally ill. As explained by Dixon J (as the Chief Justice then was) as long ago as 1933 (in Porter at 187):
	


“… a great number of [the] people who come into a Criminal Court are abnormal. They would not be there if they were the normal type of average everyday people. Many of them are very peculiar in their disposition and peculiarly tempered…. Nevertheless, they are mentally quite able to appreciate what they are doing and quite able to appreciate the threatened punishment of the law and the wrongness of their acts, and they are held in check by the prospect of punishment. It would be very absurd if the law were to withdraw that check on the ground that they were somewhat different from their fellow creatures in mental make-up or texture at the very moment when the check is most needed.”

His Honour went on to point out:

“(The criminal law) attempt[s] to define what are the classes of people who should not be punished although they have done actual things which in others would amount to crime. It is quite a different object to that which the medical profession has in view or other departments of the law have in view in defining insanity for the purpose of the custody of a person’s property, capacity to make a will, and the like.”


	
	As I say, the standard of proof of mental illness is less exacting than proof beyond reasonable doubt, but, in a given case, the necessary elements of the defence may not be easily satisfied. The legal requirements of the defence have been established since 1843 (R v McNaughten (1843) 8 ER 718) in the following terms:
	


“… to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the quality and the nature of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.”


	
	This was further discussed, again by Dixon J, in Porter at 189 – 190:
	


“The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in the sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by “wrong”? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people.”

Keeping these principles in mind, it is necessary for me to focus on that short period of time during which the accused shot and killed, his parents, Margaret Settree and Ian Settree to resolve this issue, alongside the expert psychiatric evidence as to his mental health. But questions of mental health do not emerge in a vacuum, so it is necessary to also consider his past and subsequent medical history which may shed light on his condition at the time of the shootings. At the very least these matters provide context.


	
	I turn now to the issues of fact.
	


Issue 1 – Deliberate act


	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the shooting of Margaret Settree and Ian Settree were deliberate acts of the accused which caused their deaths. I come to this conclusion having considering the formal admissions made by the accused; the evidence of the cause and manner of death; the accused’s conduct after the shooting; and his statements to the police after the event.
	
	
	I was particularly bolstered in this conclusion by the evidence of Mr Bellotti who was the first person to speak to the accused following the shooting; the police officers who were first at the scene of the crime and the evidence of the psychiatrists as to what the accused told them as to what occurred.
	


Issue 2 – Mental illness defence


	
	I turn now to the second issue of whether I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused has made out the mental illness defence. The prosecution and the defence each rely upon the opinion of a respected, experienced, and eminent forensic psychiatrist. The defence called Associate Professor Anthony Samuels and the Prosecution, Dr Olav Nielssen. They agree that at the time of the shootings the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind, probably paranoid schizophrenia (Dr Nielssen does not prefer the term “paranoid”) which caused a defect of his mind.
	
	
	Both experts considered, adapting the language of Dixon J (Porter at 189 – 190), that he maintained the capacity to know the nature and quality of his actions. Professor Samuels’s view is that because of his defect of reasoning, he felt justified about the actions he took. I infer that this sense of justification amounts to an inability to reason about whether what he was doing was wrong, because of the disordered state of his mind which results from the psychiatric illness.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen’s view is that because of his disease, the accused was “not able to appreciate that his actions in shooting his parents were morally wrong”. Dr Nielssen said, “He was not able to reason with a sense of composure about the influence of his delusional thinking on his perception of events”: (Report dated 19/12/15 page 15).
	
	
	As can be seen, the psychiatric evidence, in terms of the opinion of each expert on the facts as agreed upon by the parties, supports the finding that the mental illness defence has been established. Both experts have been involved in the case for some time. It is fair to say that neither was, at least firmly, of the view that the accused had the mental illness defence available to him initially. But their opinions in that regard have firmed-up by them taking opportunity afforded them to consider a wide range of material made available to them by the parties, including statements by family members and other associates of the accused about their observations of the accused’s behaviour over many years; contemporaneous medical records compiled, albeit spasmodically, over more than 15 years (including the records of Justice Health since his incarceration); the accused’s personal journals and other documents prepared in his own hand; and the recordings of his police interviews.
	
	
	As Dr Nielssen said in his second report 26 July 2015 at page 3,
	


“After reviewing the additional material, I am now more firmly of the opinion that Mr Settree has a defence of mental illness open to him for these offences. His chronic schizophrenic illness is a disease of the brain that produces a pattern of abnormality of mind that is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind. At the time of offences he had a defect of reason in the form of the delusional beliefs that his parents had conspired to ruin his life, as well as other bizarre delusions that confirm his inability to critically review his own thinking. He was probably aware of the nature and quality of his actions in fatally shooting his parents. However, after considering the further material, I now believe that at the time of the offences, Mr Settree was deprived of the ability to recognise that his actions were morally wrong which is evident in the beliefs that he expressed about his parents and his initial lack of remorse.”


	
	That the final opinions of the experts have been arrived at gradually over a relatively long period of time and with the benefit of reference to a considerable body of other evidence, to my mind, enhances, rather than detracts from, their persuasiveness.
	
	
	However, I bear in mind that the value of expert opinion is very much dependent upon whether the facts assumed for the purpose of expressing the opinion are sufficiently like the facts as I find them to be. I am not obliged to accept the opinion of any expert. I am entitled to reject the evidence, especially where the facts upon which the opinion is based do not accord with the facts as I find them to be.
	
	
	It is very important to bear in mind, however that the expert evidence is not challenged by either party. Both parties propound it. Notwithstanding this, it is for me to decide whether I am actually satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr Settree has made out the mental illness defence.
	
	
	In undertaking my review of the evidence I have borne in mind that if it is shown that the two doctors not only come to the same conclusion, but provide like reasons for it which “clearly lead to that conclusion … the right decision … must be that the defence has been made out” (R v Jenkins (1963) 64 SR (NSW) 20 at 31 by Walsh J).
	
	
	The reliability of the expert psychiatric evidence very often depends, at least in substantial part, upon the validity of the assumptions they have made about Mr Settree’s medical history, and the reliability of the accounts he gave them.
	
	
	The accused has voluntarily provided an account of the events surrounding his alleged offending to the expert witnesses. As he has not given evidence, it is appropriate that I warn, or caution, myself that hearsay evidence is often unreliable perhaps especially when it consists of out of court statements by a person accused of a serious crime, who may therefore have a motive for proffering self-serving statements of an exculpatory type. Frankly, what the accused has said in this case is not exculpatory. However, that Mr Settree cannot be cross-examined on those histories could affect the weight which might be accorded them. I record however that both counsel accept that they are reliable. Nonetheless the statements made are admissible because they are the foundation, or part of the foundation, of the opinions expressed by Professor Samuels and Dr Neilssen. Being admissible for that purpose, I am entitled to rely upon them, if I am otherwise persuaded as to their reliability, as evidence of the truth as an exception to the hearsay rule under s 60 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	Whilst I am not bound to accept these out of court statements, as they are consistent with the other evidence I have received, and the experts regard what the accused told them as consistent with his disease, I am satisfied that his account is probably reliable and should be accepted.
	


The accused’s background


	
	The accused is a 48 year old man, who at the time of the alleged offences was living with his parents in Cobar. His early life is unremarkable in many ways. He grew up with his parents and older sister, Wendy Robinson, in Nyngan, and later in Cobar. He left school in year 10 before taking up an apprenticeship in the mines which he did not complete. It is not to my mind irrelevant that the accused has struggled to maintain continuous employment. At different times he worked at the petrol station owned by his parents, as a driller in a local copper mine, a musician and as a carer for his children while his then wife worked as a teacher. He had been working for the local council for a period but left that work due to his poor mental health in about July 2013. According to the psychiatric evidence which I accept, his difficulty holding down jobs may be due to the social-dysfunction caused by his underlying disease of schizophrenia.
	
	
	The accused married Lyn in his early twenties. She was also a musician as well as a schoolteacher. They have two children from their marriage. Following the breakdown of their marriage, the children remained with their mother who subsequently remarried. The accused initially moved back in with his parents after his separation from his wife, but later moved and lived elsewhere in Cobar for two to three years. He seems not to have been able to function living independently. He returned to living at his parents’ home, who supported him financially and with domestic tasks.
	
	
	The evidence of Wendy Robinson suggests that the accused has a history of violence and threats to his family, particularly towards his mother. Despite this Margaret Settree, by the accounts of close family and friends, was always supportive of her son, procuring references on occasions when he ran foul of the law. She did this for him even when he was charged with assaulting her. His father, according to Wendy Robinson and Ashley Bellotti, thought that Margaret Settree was too indulgent of the accused, and wanted him to be more self-sufficient. In the weeks prior to his death, Ian harboured fears that the accused would commit suicide.
	
	
	The accused was also physically violent towards his wife when they were living together, particularly in 1999 when the accused’s methylamphetamine use led to a florid psychosis. At one point, he pointed a gun at the head of his wife after she had persisting in challenging him to seek treatment because of his obviously delusional beliefs. He also threatened violence to his sister Wendy Robinson, her former husband and their son, and damaged their personal property. Viewed through the prism of the diagnosis of schizophrenia, this violence is probably a manifestation of the disease. The experts explained the nature of his disease was generally characterised by delusions which they defined as fixed false beliefs adhered to in the face of compelling contrary evidence. The auditory and visual hallucinations commonly experienced by other sufferers of the disease are not symptoms currently experienced by the accused. Dr Nielssen said that about 25% of delusions experienced by sufferers of schizophrenia were “grievance delusions” where the patient harboured unreasonable and baseless resentment about how others treated him.
	
	
	Understandably, without the benefit of the expert diagnosis one might understand these outbursts as evidence only of a violent disposition which might, of itself, escalate into dangerous behaviour without any underlying pathology. With the benefit of the expert’s opinion, I am satisfied that these outbursts were a manifestation of the disease resulting from the challenge by friends and family, unwittingly, of his psychotic delusional belief systems.
	
	
	I interpolate that this interpretation is supported by a review of his longitudinal history as a whole, rather than examining individual incidents piecemeal.
	


The accused’s mental health history prior to his incarceration


	
	The accused’s first interaction with mental health services was in August 1999 when he was 31 years of age. Notes from the Lismore Base Hospital from 1999 and 2000 record a provisional diagnosis of underlying psychosis or drug-induced psychosis. He had been using cannabis and methamphetamine over a four month period prior to August 1999, when he reported symptoms of paranoia, delusional thinking together with visual and auditory hallucinations. Initially he refused to take the prescribed dosage of Risperidone, believing it to be heroin and an attempt to poison him. Aspects of the history recorded at Lismore are very significant. He told the mental health worker he saw that he had an episode of psychosis with paranoid features three years previously after using illegal drugs, but it resolved after two to three weeks. His presentation at Lismore was brought about by a bad trip of speed ten weeks earlier. It is very significant that the symptoms, not only persisted, but worsened after he ceased using the drug. His symptoms included frank paranoia involving a conviction that people “were interfering with him”. That people had intruded his house at night, and had “bugged” the home, the phone and the family car. He was so paranoid that he was wandering the property, armed, at night to ward off these non-existent intruders.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen explained that the first significant onset of psychotic symptoms in sufferers of schizophrenia is often precipitated by drugs, most commonly cannabis, but also stimulants. He regarded these phenomena as drug exposed, rather than induced, schizophrenia. In the light of this evidence, it seems likely that the accused’s illness became manifest at around the age of 30.
	
	
	While by 10 August 1999 he had apparently settled into his medication regime, records from January 2000 indicate that he had not wholly recovered. His wife Lyn reported to the hospital that he was again psychotic and paranoid, such that she left their home with their children and went to stay with her parents in Dubbo, I infer for her safety and that of their children. It is notable that his parents did their best to help him at this time, a matter he does seem to have appreciated.
	
	
	This paranoid thinking about being poisoned or surreptitiously given heroin is a persistent delusion of the accused. The fear of being poisoned, according to Dr Samuels, is a typical example of paranoia experienced by schizophrenic sufferers. The accused recorded this paranoid thinking in 2009 in a journal he kept while at the Dooralong rehabilitation clinic for his alcohol abuse. In 2014, he recounted to psychologist Angela Webb his experiences as a small child when his uncle injected him with heroin, with his parents failing to protect him from this abuse. The niece of the accused also witnessed the accused at the house of his parents, smash a plate of food prepared and left for him by his mother, accusing her of attempting to poison him.
	
	
	The accused spent about 8 months in the Dooralong Transformation Centre until 1 July 2009. He left without completing the course in circumstances which may be significant. He had formed an infatuation with a female counsellor and apparently convinced himself that she loved him. I infer that when the inappropriateness of his beliefs about the counsellor were pointed out to him he became very abusive, using the most offensive language and quit the course. This behaviour typifies the response others have noticed where his delusions about the women he desires are challenged.
	
	
	The case notes from Dooralong are instructive in as much as he first disclosed his delusion about witnessing murders perpetrated by his uncle when he was a toddler at this time. Part of the course involved keeping a journal and writing an autobiography. His journal discloses in great and intimate detail the bizarre delusion about the film star, Penelope Cruz. When I read his writings I formed the impression that they were the product of a disturbed mind.
	
	
	Professor Samuels and Dr Nielssen connect this intense resentment, conflict and aggression towards his parents to some of the accused’s other delusions, and are of the opinion that it was their challenging of his delusional belief system which increased the very negative dynamic in their relationship; specifically, his delusion that he was in romantic relationship with Penelope Cruz, and at times other famous female performers, including Olivia Newton-John and Jennifer Lopez. Prior to entering Dooralong in 2008, he had told some people about his relationship with Cruz, which he said began as a friendship when they were both three years old. He told his wife Lyn about it in letters, and according to the evidence of his son Adam, this was a cause of friction between the accused and his father, Ian Settree. The accused wrote in a note in May 2008, ostensibly in relation to a conversation they had where he had disclosed his delusions:
	


“ After our talk today (13/5/08) I felt horribly sick with the realisation that not only were you unaware of all this but so is Wendy. That hurt a lot. No wonder I don’t trust you. She along with mum think I’m highly deluded… Still! After nine years. I’ve got to the point whereupon I don’t care about the circumstances of putting this in writing. 9 years is a long time to hold anything in, let alone something this big. I totally understand why you have not seen or accepted all this, but it’s time to put blind faith in your son.”

Doubtless the family hoped that the long residential course of rehabilitation by addressing his substance abuse would cure him of whatever else it was that was ailing him.


	
	While his mental illness in 1999 appeared to be instigated by the accused’s use of methamphetamine, his delusions, paranoia and intense resentment did not abate with his desistance from illicit substance use and alcohol consumption.
	
	
	Both psychiatrists report that his delusions continued while in custody, and even after commencing antipsychotic medication. While the accused acknowledged to Dr Samuels that some of his psychotic experiences in 1999-2000 were due to speed, he did not similarly recognise that his relationship with Cruz and experience playing music with Olivia-Newton John were delusions (Dr Samuels Report dated 6 August 2015 at p 33-34). Indeed he remained resentful when the truth of these beliefs was challenged.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen in particular he considered the possibility that the accused’s stated beliefs of relationships with famous women from the arts where merely fantasies rather than delusions. But discarded that possibility having regard especially to the accused’s adherence to these beliefs which could not possibly be true. It was also evident that he greatly resented being challenged about these beliefs, in turn giving rise, as I have said, to what Dr Nielssen described as “grievance delusions”.
	
	
	I have also taken into account, given that the object of these delusions were famous entertainers known around the world, they have about them the flavour of baseless grandiose ideas, characteristic of the disease. I would put the compelling evidence about him stalking certain women living in Cobar in the same category. I accept that it is possible that this was merely antisocial behaviour. But again, considered in context, it fits in with the other evidence about his interconnected delusional belief system. He seemed to genuinely believe that the women loved him, and that it was inevitable that they would respond positively to his advances, unwanted as they in truth were. The element of grandiosity is that he believed that everyone loved him and that there was something wrong with you if you didn’t; rejection feeding into his well-overblown sense of grievance.
	
	
	This attitude that everybody loved him is most evident in the autobiography he wrote as “Step 4” of his treatment program at Dooralong in 2009. By then he had been sober and free of drugs for several months but his writings at that time thoroughly demonstrate the persistence of these grandiose delusions.
	
	
	As Dr Nielssen explained, grandiosity is a central part of the disease, even in its paranoid aspects: the sufferer thinks “I must be important, the Canadian Secret Service are in touch with me about my nephew’s conduct in Canada”; or, “I must be important because some authority or other is bugging my house and my phone.” The sufferer feels important even if the paranoia is unsettling.
	
	
	I am also well satisfied that the grievances he felt about his parents treatment of him is utterly delusional. The truth, which is well established, on the whole of the evidence before me, is that Margaret and Ian Settree were respectable, hardworking, decent people, well liked and admired in their local community. Many of the things the accused has said or written about in the course of previous treatment, whilst in custody and before could not possibly be true. I will not detail his denigration of them in this judgment, out of respect for their memory. The truth of the matter is that they were loving, caring, and protective parents who always went out of their way to look after him even when his psychotic behaviour must have been extremely trying and threatening to them. His contrary beliefs are delusional.
	
	
	He told Dr Samuels (at page 35) that because he was depressed,
	


“this gave [my parents] power over me, strength to control me. They liked me living with them under their banner; hat; rules of the house…I felt belittled by that”

This was a delusional subservience from which he felt the urge to free himself.


	
	The accused exhibited further examples of delusional thinking and grandiose ideas about himself that further increased his conflict with certain family members as sometimes manifested in threatening and violent behaviour towards them. He told his niece Demi Robinson that he was involved with Bikies (Exhibit A, tab 23, [21]) and also his son Adam Settree (Exhibit A, tab 20).On another occasion, he used his supposed position as number 2 in the Rebel Bikie Gang to his nephew Jaye Robinson to threaten him, after Jaye demanded he make reparations for the damage the accused had done to Jaye’s home after being excluded from Christmas dinner one year (Exhibit A, tab 34).
	


The accused’s mental illness


	
	As my analysis demonstrates the accused has had significant mental health problems since the late 1990s. My strong impression from the evidence is that they continued throughout albeit without any real evidence of the florid symptoms that had led to his treatment at Lismore Hospital in 1999. This apparently is not unusual. Dr Samuels identified his condition as a particular form of schizophrenia that was not characterised by florid psychosis and prominent auditory hallucinations:
	


“And in fact they classify into bizarre and non-bizarre and the more sort of disorganised your psychotic illness is the more they tend to be bizarre. But in fact his mental status always quite organised and contained and the delusions were quite circumscribed. And as far as I know he never apart from perhaps when he was using amphetamines wasn’t exhibiting florid thought disorder, marked visual hallucinations or auditory hallucinations. Seemed to be quite circumscribed and those more non-bizarre delusions are more in keeping with sort of the paranoid delusional disorder sort of spectrum schizophrenia as opposed to the more epiphrenic disorganised type of schizophrenia.” (38.35T)


	
	I accept the evidence that untreated as it was for so long his condition would have worsened and his complex delusional thought patterns would have become more entrenched and pervasive.
	
	
	At paragraph 42 I remarked that he resigned from a job he had in the parks and gardens section of the local council and expressed the view that this was probably part of his social dysfunction due to his schizophrenia. He was apparently employed as the urban team supervisor. His medical records indicate that he was treated for work related stress and he saw a psychologist, a Ms Webb, for the first time on 27 July 2013. He gave her a history of severe depression for which he had received treatment from a local GP. He continued under Ms Webb’s care, occasionally being reviewed by a psychiatrist, up until the time of the shootings. Dr Nielssen expressed the view that the condition may have been a manifestation of his schizophrenia or an incidental co-morbidity. Looking at all of the evidence I am persuaded that it was the former, and although I do not criticise the health professionals involved, I am of the view that they missed this diagnosis. In particular, as Dr Nielssen pointed out, one cannot criticise the psychologist. She is not trained to make diagnoses.
	
	
	Ms Webb administered a treatment known as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy. I don’t pretend to understand this treatment nor is it explained in the evidence. During this treatment the accused disclosed some of his delusions including those relating to having witnessed murders as a toddler and his delusions about his parents. As I have said, the significance of these was missed. But he certainly told Ms Webb about his feelings of very strong resentment towards his parents and in particular his father.
	
	
	Dr Hugh, psychiatrist, examined him by AVL in November 2014 to review the depression medication prescribed by his local doctor. He also elicited the delusions about being a witness to murder. On that one interview Dr Hugh was uncertain about whether these “memories” were delusions. On mental state examination over the AVL he found no evidence of psychotic thinking, delusions or hallucinations. Dr Hugh however intended to re-examine the accused to “get a bit more clarity about the veracity of his memories and their meaning.” Events intervened to deny him this opportunity.
	


The accused’s condition on 3 December 2014


	
	The evidence indicates following the review of his medication by Dr Hugh the accused’s mood deteriorated. In particular he did not cope well off Endep which he had used to help with sleep and he complained of increased anxiety. I interpolate that what was described by those treating him as anxiety may well have been the agitation that schizophrenia sufferers often complain of. That he had a made an appointment to see his doctor on 3 December says something significant about his mental state at that time.
	
	
	As I have said, there is no dispute as to the course of events on 3 December 2014. In his account to the police, the accused said it was an otherwise normal day. For reasons that are not explained, he attended his GP’s surgery to cancel his medical appointment. The receptionist noted that he appeared flustered or agitated at the time. Feeling slightly anxious, he later went, at about 4 pm, to the Great Western Hotel, where he drank his usual nine schooners of full strength beer over a period of about ninety minutes or so. He was observed by the publican to be dejected and withdrawn in manner, but did not appear particularly intoxicated, which is corroborated by his blood alcohol reading giving rise to an estimate of between 0.13 % and 0.17 % when he shot his parents. The overwhelming evidence is that his drinking habits were such that he had developed a very high degree of tolerance to the effects of alcohol. He probably felt little affected at the time of the shootings. Indeed the evidence was that given his alcohol abuse, it was “necessary” for him to maintain his level of consumption to avoid severe withdrawal symptoms. He left the hotel in the early evening at around 6.15 – 6.30 pm and went home.
	
	
	I have dealt in detail the surrounding circumstances of the death of Margaret and Ian Settree and it is unnecessary to repeat them here. However the psychiatrists found aspects of his behaviour in the aftermath significant to their understanding of his mental state at the time of the shooting. Having killed his parents he acted in a strangely detached, calm manner. He turned off the oven that was reheating pizzas and secured the dogs. He left the gun on the table. He considered contacting the police but the decided against it because he was fearful that they would shoot him. For this reason he decided to return to the hotel and speak to the publican Mr Belotti.
	
	
	When interviewed by police, after the shooting and subsequently he remained strangely detached. He did not show any emotion one way or another, as the psychiatrists would have expected of a person of normal sensibilities who had committed such a dreadful act. The significant impression the psychiatrists formed from watching the recordings of the interviews was, although he may have known that killing his parents was against the law he felt justified in doing it because of what he perceived to be their mistreatment of him. That is to say, he was at the time of the shooting labouring under an active grievance delusion directed at his parents.
	


Justice Health Records and post incarceration diagnosis


	
	Notwithstanding previous contact with mental health professionals, it was not until he was taken into custody for these alleged offences that his current diagnosis was gradually reached.
	
	
	He was treated in custody by a Dr Hearps, psychiatrist, who examined him on 13 May 2015, 3 June 2015 and 8 June 2016. Dr Hearps received from the accused a more complete history of his delusions, and developed the diagnosis of schizophrenia for the first time. According to his records, the delusional thinking of the accused may date-back to when he was 14 years old, predating his psychotic episodes in 1999.
	
	
	The accused has continued to receive treatment in custody but I have formed the impression that his condition is not yet under control. He does seem to have gained further insight into his difficulties but remains resentful if challenged about his delusional beliefs. Given how entrenched his untreated condition was at the time of the shootings, even with adequate treatment his prognosis must be, at best, uncertain.
	


Determination


	
	This body of evidence actually persuades me on the balance of probabilities that, at the time he shot each of his parents, Margaret and Ian Settree, the accused at that time had an active delusion, forming part of his delusional belief system, which was symptomatic of his type of schizophrenia. This is undoubtedly a disease of the mind.
	
	
	On the evidence of the experts, I accept that from the account given by Mr Settree of his perceptions when he shot his parents, which I accept as reliable, that he was then labouring under a delusional belief system which was symptomatic of his paranoid schizophrenia. I am satisfied when he killed each of his parents, the accused suffered from a disease of the mind giving rise to a defect of reason such that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong according to the accepted standards of ordinary members of the community. I find this because I am satisfied that his condition then was such as left him unable to reason about his actions and beliefs with even a moderate degree of sense and composure in the relevant sense because his capacity to do so was overborne by his grievance delusion about his parents oppression of him.
	
	
	It follows from this finding that I will return a special verdicts that Scott Settree is not guilty of the murder of Margaret Settree and not guilty of the murder of Donald Ian Settree by reason of mental illness. This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider the issue of intent or the alternative defence of substantial impairment.
	
	
	In making this decision I wish to record that notwithstanding the agreement of the experts and Counsel that these are the proper verdicts on the evidence, I have given anxious consideration to the question whether raising the mental illness defence was a device on the part of the accused to avoid accepting responsibility for the heinous crime of murdering his parents and to avoid the condign punishment of a very long term of imprisonment which would have inevitably followed. I am satisfied that that alternative may be safely discarded. In coming to this conclusion I have borne in mind the legitimate interest of the criminal law in vindicating Margaret and Ian Settree and the legitimate interest of their family friends in the punishment of any person who may have been guilty of such a crime.
	
	
	The criminal law does not treat the seriously mentally ill as criminally responsible for actions which would in others be unlawful, attracting severe punishment. It may have seemed to others that the accused’s behaviour was at times that of a social misfit with a violent streak. However, having had the benefit of all of the evidence in the case which has resulted from the careful and thorough police investigation and the considered opinions of the experts, I am satisfied that the accused was at the time of the shooting, to use an out-of-date expression, criminally insane.
	
	
	As I said at the outset, a special verdict is not the same as a verdict of not guilty. Mr Settree may not walk free from this court. It is apparent to me from the evidence I have received that his particular disease is a serious illness which is likely to remain resistant to treatment.
	
	
	In these circumstances there is not the slightest question of it being appropriate to release Mr Settree into the community at this time. I am not satisfied that he does not present a danger to himself or to others. Indeed the evidence of Dr Samuels is that he remains a danger. Accordingly the effect of my verdict will be that Mr Settree will be committed to the long-term supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. Pursuant to s 43(a) of the Act, the Tribunal may not release Mr Settree into the community unless and until it is satisfied that he will not seriously endanger any person including himself.
	


Orders


	
	My orders are:
	



	
	Under s 38 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), I return a special verdict of not guilty of the charge of murder of Margaret Settree by reason of mental illness;
	
	
	Under s 38 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), I return a special verdict of not guilty of the charge of murder of Donald Ian Settree by reason of mental illness;
	
	
	Under s 39 of the Act, Scott Settree is to be detained in a correctional facility or at such other place as determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law;
	
	
	I direct the Registrar to notify the Minister for Health of these orders;
	
	
	I direct the Registrar to notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal of my special verdict and of these orders. The Registrar is to provide the Tribunal with a copy of these reasons, my orders, the transcript of proceedings for 3rd August, 2016 and the reports of Drs Samuel and Nielssen.
	


Reasons for sentence on firearms charge


	
	I will now deal with the firearms offence to which the accused pleaded guilty in the Local Court and for which he was committed to this Court to be sentenced. Notwithstanding what I have found to be his well-entrenched mental illness of some severity, I should record that Drs Samuel and Nielssen are both of the view that he is fit to plead and he has adhered to that plea of guilty in this Court.
	
	
	I was initially concerned that there would be an inconsistency or incongruence between special verdicts of not guilty of murder by reason of mental illness for the murder charges, on the one hand, and guilty of the firearm charge, on the other. I felt this may have been especially so, as the particulars contained in the court attendance notice make clear that the offence of possessing the unauthorised prohibited twelve gauge pump action shotgun was committed at about the time of the shootings. It is the weapon the accused used to kill his parents.
	
	
	Section 4 of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) defines possession of a firearm as including any case in which a person knowingly has custody of a firearm. There is no doubt that even in his disordered state of mind the accused knew he had the gun and where it was. But it seemed to me questionable whether he could reason that possessing the gun was wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people. There is no reason in law why the provisions of Pt 4 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1986 (NSW) could not apply to an indictable firearms offence. Moreover, there is a factual and evidential basis which may be capable of engaging that legislation. The evidence clearly shows that his delusions are accompanied by significant paranoia which caused him to lash out at those who challenged his false beliefs. Dr Nielssen accepted that keeping a loaded gun was part of his paranoia. The accused told him that he kept it to protect himself from intruders. There were no intruders.
	
	
	There was also evidence that in August 1999 when he did suffer florid psychosis that he wandered his property armed and discharging a firearm to ward off the delusional intruders.
	
	
	Notwithstanding my legal reservations about the matter, I am persuaded I should accept the plea of guilty and pass sentence on the accused for this offence.
	
	
	As I have said, he is fit to plead. There is no reason to suppose that he does not understand the ramifications of entering a plea of guilty for this offence. It is well recognised that people may decide to plead guilty for a variety of reasons even in circumstances where they may doubt their legal responsibility. The Court is entitled to act upon a plea of guilty proffered by a person competent to enter it. It seems to me, having regard to the arguments of counsel, that is the principle that I should give effect to in respect of this charge.
	
	
	In any event, my powers in respect of the accused’s plea are not unlimited and seem to be governed by ss 104, 105 and 107 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). They appear to be limited to remitting the matter to the Local Court for the continuation of committal proceedings, dealing with the accused on his plea of guilty or ordering him to stand trial if he changes his plea, which he has not done. The only matter which gives rise to my doubt about the proper course of action is the possible availability of the mental illness defence for this charge. With the reservations I have stated I am prepared to accept what is the joint submission of counsel that the effect of the mental illness defence on this charge is not necessarily the same as on the murder charges.
	
	
	The pump-action shot gun is clearly a dangerous weapon. Maintaining it in a loaded, easily accessible state enhanced its dangerousness. It is clear that he was in the habit of maintaining the gun in that state so that the particular offence charged is not an isolated, uncharacteristic incident. It would be an egregious breach of principle to factor into my assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending the consideration that the gun was used as a murder weapon as this would involve Di Simone error. I would assess the objective seriousness of this offending at somewhat below the mid-range.
	
	
	The offence under s 7 of the Firearms Act as at December 2014 carried a maximum penalty of 14 years, and a standard non-parole period of three years. These considerations are important guideposts to the seriousness of offending of this type which I will bear firmly in mind.
	
	
	The prevalence of firearms offences in the community is of significant concern. This brings considerations of general deterrence directly into play.
	
	
	The accused pleaded guilty in the Local Court at the first available opportunity and I propose to discount the sentence I otherwise would have imposed by 25% for the utilitarian value of his plea. He has a previous criminal record but it is not long nor a particularly serious one. However the past commission of crimes of violence are relevant to the degree of leniency that might be extended. I bear in mind however that his mental illness may be relevant to past offending, at least since 1999, and that consideration may not have been obvious to the courts dealing with him since then.
	
	
	His mental illness is obviously relevant for sentencing purposes as it reduces his suitability as a vehicle for the general deterrence otherwise called for in this case, and ameliorates the necessity to provide for specific deterrence as a factor in fixing the appropriate sentence. The evidence of Dr Samuels is that his schizophrenia makes him a danger to the public but that factor is less relevant for current sentencing purposes as it has been addressed in the orders I have pronounced under s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. 
	
	
	In my judgment, bearing all the facts, matters and circumstances to which I have referred firmly in mind, the appropriate sentence for this offence and this offender is a fixed term of fulltime imprisonment of 18 months duration. Given the orders I have made already today, it is clearly appropriate that I refrain from making any order that may be taken as suggesting he is entitled to be released from custody. However given the special verdict it may now be seen that his past custody on remand has been in substance for this offending and I will back-date the commencement of the sentence accordingly.
	
	
	Scott Settree, upon your plea of guilty I convict you of possessing an unauthorised prohibited firearm on 3 December 2014, contrary to the provisions of s 7(1) Firearms Act 1996 (NSW). I sentence you to a fixed term of fulltime imprisonment of 18 months duration, commencing on 3 December 2014 and expiring on 2 June 2016.

		05 August 2016",2016-08-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2428523,Finch v R (No 2) [2016] NSWCCA 153,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 13 July 2016 the principal judgment was delivered by the Court in this appeal: Finch v R [2016] NSWCCA 133. In order to understand what follows, this judgment should be read together with the principal judgment.
	
	
	The applicant was self-represented at the hearing of the appeal. During the hearing he sought leave to raise a further ground of appeal concerning the alleged incompetence of his counsel at trial, which was referred to in the principal judgment as “Proposed Ground 11”.
	
	
	By Proposed Ground 11 the appellant sought to contend that defence counsel at the trial was incompetent in two respects:
	



	
	he was often late; and
	
	
	he “didn’t seem to be aware about the laws concerning LSD”, which the Court concluded meant that he did not object to evidence concerning the method of consumption of cardboard LSD or make the submission concerning liquid LSD referred to in addressing Ground 3 on the Notice of Appeal.
	



	
	The Court reserved its decision on Mr Finch’s application to add proposed Ground 11 at the hearing of the appeal and indicated it would give the parties an opportunity to address the issue in writing after delivery of the principal judgment.
	
	
	On 13 July 2016, in respect of Proposed Ground 11 the Court made the following order:
	


(4) Within 14 days the parties exchange with one another and file written submissions of no greater length than 10 pages each with the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal on the subject of whether:

(a) having regard to these reasons, leave should be granted to amend the notice of appeal to include Proposed Ground 11; and

(b) if leave under paragraph 4(a) of these orders were granted, what orders the Court should make and whether it would be necessary or desirable to receive any further evidence or to conduct any further oral hearing of the matter.

Applicant’s submissions


	
	No submissions were received by the Court from Mr Finch within the period fixed by the order made on 13 July 2016.
	


Crown submissions


	
	The Crown filed submissions on 27 July 2016. After addressing the relevant legal tests relating to an allegation of incompetence of counsel, the Crown advanced the following submissions.
	



	
	Concerning lateness, the Crown submitted that there were only two occasions on which it was apparent from the transcript that defence counsel was late to Court. In the first instance the applicant’s solicitor was present. In the second instance the primary judge adjourned the hearing until defence counsel was present. The Crown submitted that in both cases counsel’s lateness appears to have been unavoidable, that the lateness did not suggest incompetence, and that no injustice to the applicant occurred.
	
	
	Concerning the LSD issue, the Crown referred to the Court’s findings at [113], [115], [131], [133], [221] and [222] of the principal judgment and submitted that the forensic choices apparently made by defence counsel were open to him, that those forensic choices did not suggest incompetence, and that no injustice to the applicant occurred.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that leave to rely upon Proposed Ground 11 should be refused. The Crown further submitted that it was neither necessary nor desirable that the Court receive any further evidence or conduct any further oral hearing of the matter.
	


Consideration

The requirement for leave


	
	Leave is required for Mr Finch to rely upon a further ground of appeal. Section 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) provides that a person convicted on indictment may appeal with the leave of the Court on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone, or question of mixed law and fact, or any other ground which appears to the Court to be a sufficient ground of appeal. The present is a mixed question of fact and law.
	
	
	Further, Rule 25A of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) provides that where the appellant intends to rely on grounds of appeal not stated in his notice of appeal or application for leave to appeal, he shall, within 28 days after giving his notice of appeal, or of application for leave to appeal, send his notice of additional grounds of appeal to the Registrar. The Court may extend the 28-day period. An amendment would thus require the Court to grant such an extension.
	


Relevant legal test


	
	As the principal judgment set out, the seminal case with respect to incompetence of counsel is R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 in which Gleeson CJ said at 685:
	


As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence.

However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ‘flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.


	
	In Alkhair v R [2016] NSWCCA 4 Macfarlan JA (Rothman J and Bellew J agreeing) comprehensively summarised the applicable principles with respect to incompetence of counsel. His Honour conducted an extensive review of the cases decided by this Court since Birks, and concluded (at [31]):
	


1. To the extent possible, an appellate court should determine an appeal involving complaints about a trial counsel’s conduct of a case by examining the record of the trial to determine from the objective circumstances whether the accused has had a fair trial.

2. Ordinarily, an affirmative answer to this question is required where the impugned conduct is capable of being rationally explained as a step taken, or not taken, in the interests of the accused. This is so even if the accused alleges on appeal that he or she did not authorise the conduct because the nature of the adversarial system means that the client is bound by the manner in which the trial is conducted on his or her behalf.

3. Only in exceptional circumstances will an appellate court find it necessary to resort to subjective evidence concerning the appellant’s legal representatives’ reasoning at trial or to evidence as to communications between the appellant and those representatives.

4. The ultimate question for an appellate court is whether the appellant has established that what occurred at the trial gave rise to a miscarriage of justice in the sense that the appellant lost a chance of acquittal that was fairly open.


	
	Finally, rational forensic decisions or strategies of trial counsel, determined objectively, do not give rise to a miscarriage of justice: Ahmu v R; Director of Public Prosecutions v Ahmu [2014] NSWCCA 312 at [34] (per Basten JA) and [56] (per Adams J).
	


The issue of lateness


	
	The Court has carefully examined the transcript of the trial. It appears that defence counsel was late to Court on two occasions during the trial.
	
	
	In both instances Mr Finch’s solicitor was present. It is apparent that no complaint was made by Mr Finch’s solicitor on either occasion that there was any unfairness occasioned to Mr Finch.
	
	
	On the first occasion, Mr Finch’s solicitor explained that the time was being spent productively editing the videotape to be played to the jury. The jury were not made aware that defence counsel was late. On the second occasion the trial judge adjourned the hearing until defence counsel arrived.
	
	
	Mere lateness on two occasions, without more, does not meet the tests for incompetence of counsel described at [11]-[13] above.
	
	
	There is no basis to conclude that the lateness of counsel on these two occasions occasioned any unfairness in the trial to Mr Finch.
	


Knowledge of laws relating to LSD


	
	In the principal judgment the Court reached conclusions which are fatal to Mr Finch’s claim in this respect.
	
	
	First, the Court concluded that the forensic choice made by defence counsel not to challenge DS Wheatley’s evidence concerning the method of consumption of the cardboard tabs impregnated with LSD was objectively open to him. This was so because, regardless of the outcome of that objection and any subsequent ruling about the cardboard tabs, the appellant would still have faced conviction on the same charge as a result of the liquid LSD: see [113].
	
	
	Second, the applicant’s submission that the cardboard tabs impregnated with LSD and the liquid containing LSD fell outside the scope of s 4 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) was rejected: see [131].
	
	
	Third, the Court concluded that the other forensic choices made by counsel concerning the LSD referred to at [133] and [221]-[222] of the principal judgment were objectively open to him. The verdicts were not unreasonable or against the weight of the evidence.
	
	
	Having regard to the Court’s findings, the manner in which defence counsel conducted the defence did not reveal a misunderstanding of the law relating to LSD.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the conduct of defence counsel was not negligent, let alone did it approach the standard of flagrant incompetence necessary to establish the incompetence of counsel ground.
	


Conclusion and Order


	
	For the foregoing reasons, the matters sought to be raised by Mr Finch in Proposed Ground 11 of the Notice of Appeal are without merit. They each raise mixed questions of fact and law. Given the conclusions the Court has reached, leave should be refused to rely upon Proposed Ground 11.
	
	
	The order of the Court is:
	



	
	Leave to add a Proposed Ground 11 to the notice of appeal alleging incompetence of defence counsel at the trial is refused.

		04 August 2016",2016-08-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2428530,R v Perkins [2016] NSWSC 1080,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	The trial of Andrew Perkins (the offender) and Rachel Manevski (the co-offender) was listed to commence by way of discussion of legal and logistical matters on Monday 11 July 2016, with the jury to be empanelled for a joint trial the following day, Tuesday 12 July 2016. On the earlier date, counsel for the offender sought time for an extended conference with his client. I granted that application, and subsequently the offender entered a plea of guilty to an indictment that contained a single count averring that, on 13 February 2014 at Niagara Park, he murdered Kieran Priestland (the deceased).
	
	
	The proceedings on sentence with regard to the offender were stood over to 3 August 2016. In the meantime, the trial of the co-offender commenced on Wednesday 13 July 2016, and recently concluded. That means that, in sentencing the offender, it is important for me to put from my mind all of the evidence that was placed before the jury and me in the trial of the co-offender, as a matter of procedural fairness to both parties. The Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the offender explicitly endorsed that approach, and, with their assistance, I have adopted it.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is imprisonment for life without possibility of parole. The Crown Prosecutor made no submission in support of the imposition of that ultimate sentence. There is also an applicable standard non-parole period, in the circumstances of this case, of 20 years. I regard both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period as important guideposts in my exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	The plea of guilty entered by the offender is a solemn and public admission that he voluntarily did an act that caused the death of the deceased with, at the least, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm to him. The law is clear that any matters of aggravation above and beyond the elements of the offence to which the offender has pleaded guilty must be proven to my satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt; any matters reducing the culpability of the offender need only be proven on the balance of probabilities. Some matters, of course, may be unable to be determined by me.
	


Objective features


	
	I turn to a discussion of the objective features of the offending itself. The vast majority of them were not in dispute, as demonstrated by the fact that a detailed document headed “Statement of Facts” became Crown Exhibit B without objection in the proceedings on sentence.
	
	
	On 12 February 2014, the offender was approaching 19 years of age. He was living at the family home in Niagara Park, a suburb of Gosford. Also living there were his mother, Ms Kirsten Perkins, and his 6-year-old brother, XXX. The offender was in a relationship with the co-offender, she being a young woman of about his age. The offender had also been friends since primary school with Ashleigh Cornish. Ms Cornish had been in a relationship for some time with the deceased. He was aged 18 years and 3 months, and, like the other three young persons, lived on the Central Coast of New South Wales.
	
	
	The offender invited Ms Cornish around to the family home that evening for a small social gathering with himself and his girlfriend. Ms Cornish arrived at the home at about 6.30 PM, having been dropped there by the deceased. During that trip, Ms Cornish used the mobile phone of the deceased to access social media, and she neglected to log out from the phone of the deceased. The result was that communications that she believed were private became known to the deceased. They included communications that strongly suggested to him that Ms Cornish had been seeing another young man.
	
	
	The social event proceeded unremarkably for a time, and featured the offender, the co-offender and Ms Cornish consuming some snacks, a large amount of alcohol in the form of vodka and red wine, and some cannabis (including, I accept on the balance of probabilities, what the offender has described as synthetic cannabis).
	
	
	Things were interrupted at about 10 PM, when the deceased turned up with a number of young male friends. He was upset by what he had found out about the seeming behaviour of Ms Cornish. A rather ugly event ensued on the street, which included harsh words passing between the deceased and Ms Cornish; Ms Cornish kicking the car of the deceased (a recent acquisition that was very dear to him); and the deceased apparently threatening to damage the car of Ms Perkins in response. Eventually, the deceased and his young friends departed without further incident, other than a “burnout” performed by him as an act of juvenile frustration.
	
	
	Ms Cornish was distressed by all of that. She was comforted and taken back inside by the offender and the co-offender. The social event recommenced, with more alcohol and cannabis consumed by the three young people.
	
	
	At 10.34 PM, the offender sent the following Facebook message to the mobile phone of the deceased: “Threaten to hit my property again and you will be dead cunt. Any beef you has [sic] with ash is with her, not me”.
	
	
	At a later stage, it was agreed that Ms Cornish would spend the night at the offender’s home. Later again, she changed her mind, and decided that she would rather go home (that is, to the family home of the deceased, where she was then staying). She telephoned the deceased in the early hours of the next morning, and asked him to come and pick her up. One may have expected that, upon his arrival a few moments later, the events of that evening would draw to a close, with Ms Cornish departing with the deceased, and the offender and the co-offender retiring to bed.
	
	
	Instead, something deeply disturbing and tragic happened. It is agreed between the parties that each of the offender and the co-offender said the words “I’m gonna fucking kill him”, referring to the deceased. It is also agreed that, after that, each of them went to the kitchen of the home, and Ms Cornish heard the sound of rummaging through the kitchen drawers. Thereafter, the offender armed himself with a large kitchen knife; left the home; and walked down to the roadway where the deceased was waiting for Ms Cornish. He was in the driver’s seat, the engine of his car was running, and he was still wearing his seatbelt.
	
	
	The offender mercilessly used the knife to stab the deceased to death as he sat in his vehicle. At least three very deep wounds were inflicted to the upper torso of the deceased, one of which was delivered with such great force that the knife came close to protruding from his back. Other, more shallow wounds were inflicted to his body. Separately, there were a number of cuts to his hands that were undoubtedly defensive in nature.
	
	
	The deceased died where he sat in his beloved car. He was, of course, unarmed, confined and restrained, and in no position to defend himself, let alone inflict injury upon the offender.
	
	
	After that, the offender retreated to his home, and continued from there to the backyard. In the meantime, Ms Cornish found the body of the deceased and, despite her hysteria, alerted emergency services. Paramedics promptly attended, but all efforts to save the life of the deceased were simply too late.
	
	
	Police arrested the offender attempting to conceal himself in the backyard. After that, he engaged in a recorded interview with police in the early hours of that morning, in which he chose to tell a number of exculpatory lies. He was charged with the offence of murder, refused bail, and has been in custody ever since.
	
	
	All of that, as I have said, is accepted. There were only two disputes between the parties about objective features of the offending, and they are helpfully identified in Exhibit B.
	
	
	The first was whether or not the co-offender was also present at the car when the offender committed the murder. During the proceedings on sentence, each counsel agreed with my initial thought that that question is irrelevant to these proceedings on sentence, and does not require resolution by me. On reflection, I accept that joint submission.
	
	
	The second area of dispute certainly requires resolution. It is whether the offender intended to inflict grievous bodily harm or death; to express that dispute more correctly, it is whether the Crown can prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to kill the deceased. A related dispute was directed to the time at which any intention sufficient for murder was formed by the offender.
	
	
	Counsel for the offender submitted that I could not be satisfied of the greater intention beyond reasonable doubt. He submitted that a reference to killing another person is commonly made colloquially, without the slightest intention of the speaker actually doing so. He pointed to the claim of the offender, made to a psychologist and also in the witness box, that when he first armed himself with the knife in the kitchen, he merely intended to use it to scare off the deceased, in case there were some further incident. He submitted that the number and nature of the wounds is as consistent with a loss of self-control as it is with an intention to kill. Defence counsel also submitted that the prior good character of the offender (a topic to which I shall return in more detail later) is hardly consistent with an intention to inflict death formed by a young man upon a defenceless victim. Finally, he submitted that the profound intoxication of the offender by way of alcohol and a potent synthetic drug would lead me to have a reasonable doubt about whether the greater intention had been established.
	
	
	I do not accept those submissions. That is so for the following reasons.
	
	
	It is not disputed in these proceedings that the offender and the co-offender expressed an intention to kill separately and together, as it were. Nor is it disputed that each of them went to the kitchen, and Ms Cornish heard a search through drawers for an appropriate weapon. Nor is it disputed that the offender armed himself with a kitchen knife large enough to inflict the wounds I have described, and shortly afterwards approached the car of the deceased. It is beyond dispute that the offender inflicted nine wounds to the body of the deceased, three of which were deep, and one of which pierced a rib, pierced his heart, and almost traversed the depth of his trunk.
	
	
	It is certainly the case that I am not satisfied that there was any premeditated or settled intention to kill on the part of the offender that had existed for days or even hours before he approached the car of the deceased. But I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in all of the circumstances that, at the time he went to the kitchen and obtained the knife, the offender had decided to kill the deceased, and, moments later, that is exactly what he did.
	
	
	To the extent that the offender has said otherwise, both to a psychologist and in the witness box, I reject those assertions. I take that approach not only because of the damage to his credibility done by the lies he told to the police about this murder, but also because I believe that, in truth, the offender has little or no memory of what he did, or understanding of why he did it.
	
	
	In short, the offender will be sentenced by me on the basis that, at the time of the repeated stabbing, and in the moments leading up to it, he intended to kill the deceased.
	


Objective seriousness of the offence


	
	I turn briefly to assess the objective gravity of this murder.
	
	
	Of course, all murders are crimes of the utmost seriousness, featuring as they do the criminal taking of the life of a fellow human being in the worst circumstances known to law. But it is possible to create something of a ranking of seriousness, and its creation is necessary to give content to the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period to which I have referred.
	
	
	Here, there was an intention to kill that was formed some little time before the murder was effected. A deadly weapon was obtained in order to fulfil that purpose. The attack was unremitting and extended, as evidenced by the defensive wounds. Although death came quickly, the final ordeal of the deceased was excruciating and terrifying. The life of the deceased came to an end whilst he was sitting in his own vehicle, restrained by a seatbelt, and presenting no threat whatsoever to the offender. In truth, the deceased was little more than a child, having turned 18 only 3 months before.
	
	
	By any measure, this murder cannot be assessed as anything other than extremely grave.
	


Subjective features


	
	I turn now from a discussion of the offence to a discussion of the offender.
	


Value of plea of guilty


	
	Turning first to the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, it is true that the offender pleaded guilty to murder on the day before he was to be arraigned before a jury panel. It is also true that a trial commenced in any event with regard to his co-offender.
	
	
	On the other hand, it is certainly the case that his plea to murder, albeit entered very late, made the trial of the co-offender more simple, both factually and legally. It is also the case that the offender had formally offered to plead guilty to manslaughter many weeks before he entered the plea to murder. It is true that the proffered plea to manslaughter may not have shortened very much the evidence tendered to prove that he was guilty of the more serious form of homicide in a putative trial. Nevertheless, it did mean that, from that point on, the Crown knew that, at any trial of the offender, it need not be overly troubled about the physical elements of homicide, but rather need only focus upon exculpatory partial defences, or proof of a necessary mental element for murder.
	
	
	Despite its lateness, I think that the plea of guilty to murder, especially when seen in the context of the longstanding offer to plead guilty to manslaughter, had a utilitarian value that was not insignificant. Seeking to weigh up all of the relevant factors, I have come to the view that, despite the fact that the plea to murder came very late, there should be a discount of 10% for its utilitarian value.
	


Remorse


	
	As for the separate but related question of remorse, it is undeniable that the offender has publicly and solemnly accepted his guilt of the murder of the deceased. The enormity of that step is not to be discounted, including, of course, with regard to its inevitable consequences. On the other hand, in the witness box, the offender was hardly fulsome in his expressions of remorse; I think that that may be explained partly by the stress of giving evidence in one’s own proceedings on sentence for murder, and partly by his perplexity as to what he had done. I noted that the offender accepted in the witness box that he had “ruined everything”, a correct assessment from countless perspectives.
	
	
	Separately, his mother gave evidence of an occasion when she visited her son at Goulburn Gaol, and when it seemed that he was overwhelmed by the terrible nature of what he had done, and the tragic consequences for many families. During her evidence, including her own apology proffered to the family of the deceased, I noted the offender to be sitting in the dock sobbing.
	
	
	It is true that s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) calls for consideration of whether the offender has provided evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions, and whether he has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his actions or made reparation for such consequences. On the balance of probabilities, I think that those preconditions have been sufficiently fulfilled.
	
	
	In short, the offender has accepted responsibility for what he has done. And despite the combined effect of his inability to understand why he did it, and his youthful attempts to grapple with its magnitude, I proceed on the basis that he is remorseful for it.
	


Background and motive


	
	As I have said, the offender was aged 18 years at the time of the offence and is now aged 21 years. Unquestionably, his youth is an important mitigating feature, and my sentence reflects that consideration.
	
	
	A psychological report of Dr Gilligan of 1 August 2016 was tendered in evidence and became Defence Exhibit 1. Despite my concerns about the credibility of the offender, neither he nor his mother was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor with regard to the contents of that report. In the circumstances, I accept matters of background contained within it on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	At the time of the offence, the offender had never come into contact with the criminal justice system, whether for an offence of violence or otherwise. His life up until that time had been unremarkable, and one shared by countless other young men growing up in the Australian suburbs.
	
	
	It is true that his mother had been in an unsatisfactory relationship when he was a very young child, but that came to an end when the offender was a young boy. That relationship had its distressing aspects, but there is nothing to suggest that it did psychological damage to the offender. Nor was the life of the offender as a child marred by the abuse of alcohol or prohibited drugs by those around him, nor by the infliction of violence upon him by adults.
	
	
	At school he did well, and had a particular facility with English. His intention had been to attend university, and ultimately to work as a journalist. He suffered from a bout of cancer in his childhood, which relapsed when he was aged 16 years, resulting in him being treated for depression, but that had seemingly resolved by 2014.
	
	
	Prior to his romantic relationship with the co-offender, the offender had been in a relationship with another young woman that showed no signs of problems.
	
	
	On the evening in question, he drank a great deal of alcohol and used a prohibited drug that was seemingly very potent. But there is nothing to suggest that he had some sort of longstanding dependence upon, let alone addiction to, alcohol or prohibited drugs.
	
	
	Finally, there is nothing to suggest that he suffers from any frank mental illness; I put his oddly reserved demeanour in the witness box in the proceedings on sentence down to nervousness, stress, and perplexity.
	
	
	As for motive, those generally positive features about the life and character of the offender – apart of course from what he has done – leave me with my own perplexity as to the motivation for this offence.
	
	
	It is true that there had been an unsettling disruption earlier in the evening. It is also true that an old friend of the offender, Ms Cornish, was upset by what had occurred.
	
	
	Separately, it is also true that the offender, I accept, was disinhibited by the combined effect of alcohol and a prohibited drug, and very intoxicated. Having said that, I hasten to add that I am not satisfied that his consciousness was reduced or compromised at the time of the offence. I do not accept any suggestion made by him in the witness box or to the psychologist in that regard, not least because those claims are inconsistent with his plea of guilty to murder. And in any event, Parliament has commanded that self-induced intoxication can provide nothing more than an explanation; it cannot mitigate any crime: see s 21A(5AA) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Finally, contrary to the seeming assertion of the offender, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the deceased offered the slightest provocation to the offender upon his return; and in any event, it will be recalled that the intention to kill was expressed, and the murder weapon obtained, well before the offender attended upon the motor vehicle of the deceased.
	
	
	At most, on the return of the deceased, one may perhaps have expected a slanging match between the two young men, or even some sort of physical exchange between them. In short, the motivation for the savagery that actually occurred remains very much a mystery to me.
	


Prospects of rehabilitation


	
	In custody, the offender has of course been on remand for almost exactly two and a half years. A substantial part of that time has been spent at a gaol that I readily infer would present difficulties to a young man who has never been exposed to the criminal justice system before. Generally, it seems that he has adapted to his incarceration reasonably well, including by taking advantage of the few educational opportunities that are available to him whilst on remand, though an offence against prison discipline of possessing a syringe provides a discordant note. Time will tell whether his period in custody can be used by him to explore the psychological factors that led him to commit this crime, and to understand how to avoid anything remotely like it happening again in the future.
	
	
	A louder jarring note is the seeming position of the offender that he maintains his love for the co-offender, and believes that their relationship will continue in the years ahead. In light of the fact that he has explicitly accepted in these proceedings that both he and she expressed an intention to kill at the crucial time, as well as the fact that it is a matter of public record that the co-offender has herself been convicted of a serious offence against public justice arising from the murder that he committed, I regard any continuation of that relationship as seriously detrimental to his rehabilitation.
	
	
	As for the prospects of rehabilitation of the offender more generally, there is force in the submission of the Crown Prosecutor that it is very difficult to predict how things may unfold in the years ahead. Having said that, the offender is a young man who for 18 years showed no sign of criminality or dangerousness. He enjoys the support of his mother, who impressed me as a sincere person who is engaged in her own emotional struggle with what occurred that evening. Inevitably, the violence of this murder, and one’s inability to understand it on any rational basis, gives one pause for thought about whether this offender can rehabilitate himself in the many years ahead, prior to his return to the community. Having said that, I possess a guarded optimism that he can do so.
	


Various aspects


	
	I turn to discuss various aspects of my task.
	
	
	First, these remarks on sentence set out all of the aggravating and mitigating features of the matter that I have found to exist. For that reason, I do not propose to engage formalistically with s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Secondly, both counsel were agreed that the offender has been in continuous custody since his date of arrest; namely, 13 February 2014. My sentence will commence on that date.
	
	
	Thirdly, defence counsel provided me with a sentencing decision in a broadly similar matter. That was not inappropriate; but because sentencing is an exercise in intuitive synthesis of a number of factors, and each such exercise must turn on its own facts, I shall not pause to examine that other case in any detail.
	
	
	Fourthly, defence counsel submitted that it would be open to me to find special circumstances that could lead to a shortening of the non-parole period. He invited my attention to the youth of the offender, his lack of other offending, and his undoubted need for extended help on his release.
	
	
	So much may be readily accepted; but the inevitable length of the parole period that I shall impose shortly is, to my mind, sufficient for those purposes. Having said that, although I do not believe that special circumstances have been demonstrated, I have in my calculations rounded down a matter of months here or there, because the law does not concern itself with trifles.
	
	
	Fifthly, I am required by s 25C of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) to inform the offender that it is possible that he will remain in prison even despite the complete expiry of his head sentence, if it is judged at that stage that he constitutes an unacceptable danger to the community.
	


Victim impact statements


	
	Finally, although it goes without saying that every human life is valued and protected by the criminal justice system, I wish to say something in particular about the material that was placed before me in the proceedings on sentence by way of victim impact statements. Some of them were read by their authors; one of them was read on behalf of its author; and one of them was simply tendered before me. In the absence of any oral or written application pursuant to s 28(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I have approached them in accordance with well-established principle: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76.
	
	
	Although of necessity these remarks on sentence focus on the offence of murder and the murderer who committed it, all members of the community can rest assured that the deceased has been in the forefront of my mind.
	
	
	In summary, the victim impact statements show the searing pain that has been caused to many people by the criminal act of the offender that evening. It is no exaggeration to say that the happiness of the family of the deceased has been completely destroyed. Kieran Priestland was a carefree young man, cheeky, fond of sports, devoted to family and of course his prized black car, well-liked by many, deeply loved by those close to him, and cut down in the prime of life. The suffering of many is deepened by the utter senselessness of what occurred, and the futile waste of a young life.
	
	
	On behalf of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, I extend my condolences, not only to those that placed material before me, but indeed to all of those who have been grievously wounded as a result of this murder. It is possible that the resolution of these proceedings today will provide some relief; I accept that for some there will be decades of suffering.
	


Imposition of sentence


	
	Andrew Perkins, you are convicted of the offence of murder.
	
	
	I impose a non-parole period of 15 years, to date from 13 February 2014. That will be followed by a parole period of 5 years and 6 months, which will expire on 12 August 2034.
	
	
	The first date upon which the offender will become eligible for possible release to parole will be 12 February 2029.
	
	
	To express my sentence another way, I have imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 20 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 15 years. Were it not for the plea of guilty, I would have imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 23 years.

2428613,R v Matonwal & Amood [2016] NSWCCA 174,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

Messrs Hilnand Matonwal and Ahmad Amood (the respondents) were arrested during the commission of an armed robbery at the Caltex Service Station in St Ives (the St Ives robbery). In addition to being charged with the St Ives robbery, an indictment was presented against the respondents charging eight counts of armed robbery and three counts of going with face disguised with intent to commit robbery.

The Crown sought to rely on CCTV footage of each of the counts on the indictment as tendency or coincidence evidence in respect of each of the other counts on the indictment; and evidence of the St Ives robbery as tendency or coincidence evidence in respect of all counts on the indictment.

The Crown alleged that various features of each of the robberies and attempted robberies such as the weapons used, clothing worn, height and build of each offender, escape vehicle and modus operandi were sufficiently similar either to indicate a tendency on the part of the respondents to commit robberies with those features or such that it was improbable that robberies with those features were committed by people other than the respondents.

The Crown also pointed to other evidence including shoes and clothing seized from the respondents that matched those worn by the offenders in the robberies on the indictment, shoe imprints at the scene of one of the offences that matched the shoes of one of the respondents and yellow disposable gloves, worn by the offenders in a number of the robberies, that were found in the car of one of the respondents and at the house of the other.

The trial judge refused to admit the evidence as tendency or coincidence evidence on the basis that each of the features pointed to were common features of robberies of that type. In response, the Crown presented a new indictment with three of the armed robbery offences deleted. The trial judge maintained his initial position, ruling that the evidence was still inadmissible as tendency or coincidence evidence.

The Crown appealed under s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (Criminal Appeal Act). The issues on appeal were:

1. Whether the ruling by the primary judge substantially weakened the Crown case such that leave was not required under s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act.

2. Whether the trial judge erred in considering each of the items of tendency or coincidence evidence individually rather than cumulatively.

3. Whether the trial judge erred in failing to consider the probative value of the evidence in light of the other evidence adduced by the Crown.

4. Whether the evidence should be admitted as tendency or coincidence evidence.

The Court held (Bathurst CJ, Rothman and McCallum JJ agreeing) allowing the appeal in part:

Appeal under s 5F(3A)

(i) Whether a ruling substantially weakens the Crown case is to be determined by asking whether that would be the effect, assuming that the jury accepts the evidence and that it is fit to be left to a jury. This approach involves assessing the probative value of the evidence, without taking into account issues of credibility and reliability, except to the extent those issues determine that the evidence is not relevant: [67] (Bathurst CJ); [94] (Rothman J); [95] (McCallum J).

R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228; IMM v The Queen [2016] HCA 14; 90 ALJR 529 applied

(ii) The evidence, if admitted as tendency or coincidence evidence, would have significant probative value such that the refusal to admit the evidence substantially weakened the Crown case: [68], [91] (Bathurst CJ); [94] (Rothman J); [95] (McCallum J).

Separate or cumulative consideration 

(iii) It is necessary to give consideration to evidence sought to be tendered as coincidence evidence as a whole, rather than giving separate consideration to each particular circumstance relied upon: [73] (Bathurst CJ); [94] (Rothman J); [95] (McCallum J).

R v MR [2013] NSWCCA 236 applied

(iv) While the trial judge stated that he considered the cumulative factor of the evidence, his conclusion was not supported by any analysis such that he was in error by considering the individual similarities separately: [75] (Bathurst CJ); [94] (Rothman J); [95] (McCallum J).

Considering the probative value of the evidence

(v) The task in determining whether to admit evidence as coincidence evidence is to be performed having regard to all the evidence sought to be relied on by the party seeking to tender the evidence: [71] (Bathurst CJ); [94] (Rothman J); [95] (McCallum J).

DSJ v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758; R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; 158 A Crim R 504 applied

(vi) The trial judge was in error in failing to take into account other evidence relied upon by the Crown, which was of relevance in considering whether the proposed coincidence evidence had significant probative value: [75] (Bathurst CJ); [94] (Rothman J); [95] (McCallum J).

Whether the evidence should have been admitted as tendency or coincidence evidence

(vii) In considering the admissibility of evidence as coincidence evidence, the court must, first, consider whether the evidence is relevant and second, evaluate, in the light of any evidence already adduced and evidence that is anticipated, the likelihood that the jury would assign the evidence significant probative value. In conducting that exercise, the court may have regard to the possibility that from a consideration of all of the Crown’s evidence, there emerges a real possibility of an explanation inconsistent with guilt. The court must then ask whether that possibility substantially alters its opinion of the evidence’s significant probative value: [70]-[71] (Bathurst CJ); [94] (Rothman J); [95] (McCallum J).

DSJ v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758; R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; 158 A Crim R 504 applied

(viii) The evidence in question was relevant in establishing that the respondents, who were admittedly involved in the St Ives robbery, were involved in the other robberies on the indictment and in establishing that the same persons committed each of the robberies on the indictment: [76] (Bathurst CJ); [94] (Rothman J); [95] (McCallum J).

(ix) “Significant probative value” in s 98(1)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) means probative value which is “important” or “of consequence”. The significance of the probative value must depend on the nature of the facts in issue to which the evidence is relevant and the significance or importance which that evidence may have in establishing those facts. In other words, the evidence must be influential in the context of fact-finding: [77]-[78] (Bathurst CJ); [94] (Rothman J); [95] (McCallum J).

IMM v The Queen [2016] HCA 14; 90 ALJR 529 applied

(x) The similarities between the St Ives robbery and six of the counts on the indictment had significant probative value in establishing that each of them was committed by the respondents and thus, evidence of those counts was admissible as coincidence evidence. The possible similarities between the features in the remaining two counts on the indictment and the other robberies was not sufficient to provide significant probative value: [86]-[88] (Bathurst CJ); [94] (Rothman J); [95] (McCallum J).

(xi) For the evidence to be admitted as tendency evidence, it would need to be established beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence in respect of each robbery showed that the persons committing the robberies were the respondents. Even if it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that one of the robberies was committed by the respondents, that would not establish a tendency to commit other robberies or the tendencies pleaded: [92] (Bathurst CJ); [94] (Rothman J); [95] (McCallum J).

Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: This is an appeal brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to the provisions of s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (Criminal Appeal Act) against a ruling by a judge of the District Court (the trial judge) refusing to admit certain evidence as tendency or coincidence evidence in a trial of the respondents (Messrs Matonwal and Amood) on five counts of armed robbery under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and three counts of going with face disguised with intent to commit robbery under s 114(1)(c) of that Act.
	


The Crown case


	
	The parties agreed that for the purpose of determining the admissibility of the evidence in question, the trial judge could rely on the statement of the Crown case. It was not suggested a different approach should be taken on the appeal. It should be noted, however, that some of the statements in that case of what can be seen on the CCTV footage of the incidents in question are not consistent with the Coincidence Chart of the Crown or my observations of the CCTV footage.
	
	
	The first count on the indictment ultimately presented involved a robbery at the Speedway Service Station at Regents Park (the Regents Park robbery). The Crown case was that the respondents entered the service station armed with knives and threatened the victim, a Mr Jaffar Ali, who was working alone in the store.
	
	
	The first offender was described as 24 to 25 years old, about five foot seven inches tall and of large build. CCTV footage depicts him wearing a grey hooded jumper with the hood covering his head, black tracksuit pants, a black mask and disposable yellow gloves. The Crown case statement refers to this offender wearing white shoes with yellow laces. On viewing the footage, these shoes could more accurately be described as white, green and black running shoes. The offender was armed with a meat cleaver that had a small round hole in the top corner of the blade and spoke with a Middle Eastern accent. The Crown case is that the height, build, age and cultural background of the offender is consistent with that of Mr Matonwal.
	
	
	The second offender was described as 20 to 22 years old, of Middle Eastern appearance, about five foot five inches tall and of medium build. CCTV footage depicts him wearing a blue hooded jumper with the hood covering his head, black tracksuit pants with white stripes down the outside of the legs, dark cloth (possibly a t-shirt) over his face, disposable yellow gloves and white shoes. The shoes appear to have distinctive black writing along the sides. The offender was armed with a silver knife. The height, build, age and cultural background of this offender is said to be consistent with that of Mr Amood. The Crown case was that the offenders demanded access to the safe and closed motorised shutters fitted to the windows. They instructed the victim to lie on the floor before stealing numerous packets of cigarettes. As this took place, a customer attempted to enter the store. The offenders approached the customer with one of them saying, “Come inside, we will save your life”, before the other offender said, “We have a gun, just come in otherwise you will lose your life”. In response, the customer fled. The offenders returned to the victim and demanded access to the cash register and stole about $400-$500 cash.
	
	
	The offenders ran out of the store, with one of them returning seconds later to retrieve a knife which had been left by them on the counter. The offenders fled in a blue sedan described as being a Ford with yellow and black registration plates, possibly being driven by a third unknown person.
	
	
	A short time after the offenders left, the victim discovered that two mobile phones belonging to him had also been stolen. The following morning one of those was recovered and seized for forensic testing. The second phone has not been recovered.
	
	
	A review of CCTV footage recorded at the service station depicts the offenders travelling in a sedan with silver mag-wheels. The vehicle was said to be strikingly similar in appearance to the blue Holden Commodore SV6 sedan owned by Mr Amood. It is not possible to see the vehicle’s registration due to the position and angle of the camera.
	
	
	The second count on the indictment involved a robbery at the Speedway Service Station at North Ryde on 26 April 2014 (the North Ryde robbery). The Crown case was that Mr Amood and Mr Matonwal entered the service station armed with a meat cleaver, knife and crowbar and threatened the victim, Mr Syed, who was working alone at the store.
	
	
	The first offender was described as 20-24 years old, of Middle Eastern appearance with an olive complexion, about five foot ten - six foot tall and of solid build. CCTV footage depicts him wearing a black hooded jumper with the hood covering his head, grey tracksuit pants and white sport shoes. He had disguised the lower part of his face with some type of material and was wearing disposable yellow gloves. This offender was armed with a meat cleaver that had a small round hole in the top corner of the blade and was carrying a grey sports bag. The height, build, age and cultural background of this offender is said to be consistent with that of Mr Matonwal.
	
	
	The second offender was described as 20-24 years old, of Middle Eastern appearance and around five foot six to five foot seven inches tall. CCTV footage depicted him as being of thin to medium build and wearing a grey hooded jumper with the hood covering his head and light coloured pants. His face was covered with material. On the Crown case, he was wearing woollen gloves on both his hands. On my viewing of the footage, this offender was wearing white shoes with distinctive black writing along the sides and was wearing what appeared to be one woollen glove and one white plastic glove. The height, build, age and cultural background of this offender is said to be consistent with that of Mr Amood.
	
	
	The offenders demanded access to the safe, which the victim was unable to open. The offenders turned off the store’s interior lights and closed the motorised shutters fitted to the windows. The offenders instructed the victim not to move and threatened to kill him, at one point holding a knife close to his throat. The offender stole the victim’s phone and his wallet containing about $500 cash and assorted personal and bank cards. It is alleged Mr Matonwal stole numerous packets of cigarettes and about $4,735 cash. As this took place, it is alleged Mr Amood unsuccessfully attempted to cut open a small safe located under the counter. Before leaving, the offenders stole a second mobile phone. The offenders ran out of the store and fled in a vehicle described as a dark Holden Commodore sedan bearing at least one yellow and black registration plate. The stolen phones were recovered and seized for forensic testing.
	
	
	The third count on the indictment involved a robbery at the Westside Service Station at Kenthurst on 1 May 2014 (the Kenthurst robbery). It was alleged that the respondents, armed with a meat cleaver and a knife, threatened the victim, Mr Hisham, who was working alone at the store.
	
	
	In this case, the first offender was described as about five foot seven inches tall and of large build. CCTV footage depicted him wearing a grey hooded jumper with the hood covering his head and a grey jacket over the top of the jumper, grey tracksuit pants with a white stripe down the outside of both legs, a black balaclava, disposable yellow gloves and distinctive white, green and black running shoes. The offender was armed with a large knife. The Crown alleges the height and build of this offender is consistent with that of Mr Matonwal. The second offender was described as about six foot tall. CCTV footage depicts him as being of medium build and wearing a red hooded jumper with the hood covering his head, dark grey pants, a black mask, disposable yellow gloves and white shoes with distinctive black writing on the sides. This offender was armed with a meat cleaver that had a small round hole in the top corner of the blade. The Crown alleges this offender is Mr Amood.
	
	
	One of the offenders held the blade of their knife against the victim’s neck. The other closed the service station front door. Both offenders shouted at the victim to shut the blinds. One of the offenders held a knife against the back of the victim’s neck and said, “Where’s the money. Where’s the safe drop, I’ll cut you down”. The offenders stole numerous packets of cigarettes, $10 from the victim’s wallet, his photo identification and about $2,830 cash from the register. At one point, one of the offenders punched the victim in the face. As this occurred, the offenders were disturbed by a customer attempting to gain entry and ran out of the store to a vehicle parked a short distance away.
	
	
	Witnesses described the vehicle as being a blue Holden Commodore sedan bearing a NSW registration plate, which was later ascertained to be a stolen plate. CCTV footage shows the offenders were travelling in a blue sedan with silver mag-wheels. It is alleged this vehicle is strikingly similar in appearance to the blue Holden Commodore SV6 sedan owned by Mr Amood.
	
	
	The fourth count on the indictment was a charge of going with face disguised with intent to commit a robbery (the North Ryde attempted robbery). It was alleged that on 5 May 2014, the respondents went to the Speedway Service Station at North Ryde with their faces disguised and wearing disposable yellow gloves. It is alleged the respondents had previously committed an armed robbery at this store on 26 April 2014 and as a result, the service station front doors were locked during the evening hours as a security measure.
	
	
	The first offender was described as about six foot tall and of solid build. The Crown alleges that CCTV footage depicts him wearing a grey hooded jumper with the hood covering his head, a light coloured jacket over the top of the jumper, black pants, a black balaclava and disposable yellow gloves. It further alleges that CCTV footage depicts the second male as being of slim to medium build and wearing a red hooded jumper with a hood covering his head and dark long pants On my viewing of the CCTV footage, whilst it could be seen that one of the offenders was wearing a red hoodie and the other a light coloured hoodie and both were wearing dark pants, none of the other features alleged by the Crown were visible. Nor was the clothing sufficiently identifiable to be recognised as clothing worn by either of the offenders in the other counts on the indictment.
	
	
	The offenders approached the front doors and attempted to enter the store but were unable to do so because the doors were locked. The offenders ran away towards Blenheim Road.
	
	
	The fifth count on the indictment was another charge of armed robbery, which occurred approximately two hours later at 10.55pm (the Rouse Hill robbery). It was alleged the respondents entered the Pizza Hut store at Rouse Hill armed with a meat cleaver and knife and threatened two employees and demanded money.
	
	
	In this case, one of the offenders was described as 185 cms tall and of large build. CCTV footage showed him wearing a grey hooded jumper with the hood covering his head. He was also wearing a light coloured “Champion” brand jacket over the top of the jumper, a black balaclava, disposable yellow gloves and black tracksuit pants with white stripes down the outside of the legs. He was armed with a large knife and was in possession of a black bag. The height and build of the offender is said to be consistent with that of Mr Matonwal. The second male was described as 175 cms tall and of muscular build. CCTV footage depicted him as being of slim to medium build and wearing a red hooded jumper with a white motif on the front, dark long pants and disposable yellow gloves that appeared to be worn inside out. This offender was armed with a meat cleaver. The Crown case is that the height and build of this offender is consistent with that of Mr Amood.
	
	
	The offenders held knives to the victims’ necks and demanded access to the safe. The offenders dragged the victims through the kitchen area of the store to where the safe was located, forced the victims to the floor and stole $800 from the safe and a mobile phone belonging to one of the victims. After doing so, the offenders ran out of the store and fled in a blue sedan, which the police allege was the blue Holden Commodore belonging to Mr Amood.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the “Champion” brand jacket worn by the first offender is identical in appearance to the “Champion” brand jacket worn by Mr Matonwal during the St Ives robbery. It is also alleged that the red hooded jumper with the white motif on the front, worn by the second offender, is strikingly similar in appearance to a jumper found by the police in Mr Amood’s bedroom during a search on 13 May 2014, executed pursuant to a warrant.
	
	
	The sixth count on the indictment was the second charge of going with face disguised with intent to commit a robbery (the Ermington attempted robbery). It is alleged that at about 12.26am on Thursday 8 May, the respondents went to the Blue Star Service Station at Ermington with their faces disguised and wearing disposable yellow gloves. The service station was trading, but the station doors were kept locked as a security measure.
	
	
	CCTV footage depicted the first offender as being of large build, wearing a grey hooded jumper with the hood covering his head, a light coloured “Champion” brand jacket, black tracksuit pants with white stripes down the legs, black balaclava, yellow disposable gloves and white shoes. On my viewing, the shoes were white, green and black running shoes. The Crown alleges that the clothing worn by this offender was identical to the clothing worn by one of the offenders who committed the two previous robberies. Due to the lack of visibility in the footage from the North Ryde attempted robbery, it is only accepted that the clothing was identical to that worn by one of the offenders in the Rouse Hill robbery. CCTV footage depicted the second offender as being of medium build and wearing a black hooded jumper with the hood covering his head, black tracksuit pants and yellow disposable gloves. This offender was carrying a black bag. From my viewing of the footage, it is also visible that the second offender was wearing white shoes with black writing along the side. The offenders pushed and pulled at the doors for a short period of time before leaving.
	
	
	The seventh count on the indictment was another charge of armed robbery (the McGraths Hill robbery). It is alleged that on 9 May 2014, the respondents entered the BP Service Station at McGraths Hill armed with a meat cleaver and a knife and threatened the victim, an employee of the service station.
	
	
	The first offender was described as about six foot tall and of solid build. CCTV footage depicts him wearing a grey hooded jumper with the hood covering his head and a light coloured “Champion” brand jacket over the top, a black balaclava, dark pants and disposable yellow gloves. The offender was armed with a meat cleaver that had a small round hole in the blade. The height and build of this offender is said to be consistent with that of Mr Matonwal. The clothing worn by him is said to be identical to clothing worn by one of the offenders who committed the three previous robberies. For the same reason as above, it is only accepted that this description applies to the previous two robberies. Furthermore, the CCTV footage indicates that the offender is not wearing identical pants, as there is no white vertical stripe on the pants worn by the first offender. The second offender was described as about five foot eight tall and of slim build. CCTV footage depicted him wearing a black hooded jumper with the hood covering his head, black pants and disposable yellow gloves. It is the Crown case that the height and build of this offender is consistent with that of Mr Amood.
	
	
	CCTV footage recorded inside the service station shows that the first offender approached the victim and held a meat cleaver near his throat. The victim was told to sit on the floor or he would be killed. The first offender closed the store blinds and demanded access to the safe, while the second offender stole numerous packets of cigarettes. At some point, the victim escaped and locked the store’s front doors trapping the offenders inside. They eventually escaped by kicking out a garage door located at the rear. CCTV footage recorded outside the service station shows the offenders were travelling in a blue Holden Commodore sedan with silver mag-wheels, strikingly similar in appearance to the blue Holden Commodore SV6 sedan owned by Mr Amood.
	
	
	A black sports bag, a roll of silver duct tape and a cigarette lighter, which were believed to have been dropped by the offenders, were located inside the service station near the garage door. Mr Matonwal’s DNA was identified on the roll of silver duct tape.
	
	
	The eighth and final count on the indictment was a further count of going with face disguised with intent to commit robbery (the Dundas attempted robbery). The Crown case was that at about 10.10pm on Monday 12 May 2014, the victim completed his shift at the Shell Coles Express Service Station at Dundas, locked the store and walked to his vehicle. While the victim was standing next to his vehicle he noticed two males shouting and running towards him. He described them as having something white in or on their hands. The victim got into his vehicle and locked the doors.
	
	
	The victim described both males as 165 to 175 cms tall, of medium build and said they spoke with a Middle Eastern accent. The Crown states that the CCTV footage depicts the first offender wearing a light coloured jacket, black balaclava and dark pants and the second offender wearing a dark hooded jumper with a motif on the front and light coloured/grey pants. The Crown alleges that the clothing worn by the offenders in this offence was identical to the clothing worn by the respondents when they committed the St Ives robbery less than an hour later. The CCTV footage depicts the men in poor lighting and from a reasonable distance. In my opinion, while the colours of the clothing indicated by the Crown are visible, details such as the motif and balaclava are not.
	
	
	The offenders demanded that the victim open his car. The victim sounded his horn before starting the vehicle and driving away. He later reported the incident to police. The appearance of the vehicle seen on the CCTV footage in which the offenders drove away was said to closely resemble the appearance of Mr Amood’s vehicle. On viewing the footage, I am not satisfied that the image of the car is sufficiently clear to be identified as a car resembling that owned by Mr Amood.
	
	
	Separate to the charge on the indictment, the respondents were charged with armed robbery at the Caltex Service Station St Ives on 12 May 2014 (the St Ives robbery). Each of the respondents initially pleaded guilty to the charge, but Mr Matonwal was granted leave to withdraw that plea on the basis he only intended to plead guilty to attempted robbery.
	
	
	The St Ives robbery occurred at about 10.55pm when the respondents, armed with a meat cleaver and a knife, threatened the console operator, demanding money and cigarettes. The offenders had disguised themselves with balaclavas and were wearing disposable rubber gloves. During the commission of the offence, the offenders were disturbed by police who drove into the service station and witnessed the offence. A siege ensued after the offenders refused to exit the service station. Around 12.05am on Tuesday 13 May, they exited the service station and were arrested.
	
	
	An examination of the crime scene resulted in the discovery of a meat cleaver with a small round hole in the top corner of the blade and a kitchen knife, as well as the clothing and disguises worn by the offenders being recovered. The clothing included a distinctive light coloured “Champion” brand reversible jacket and black tracksuit pants with white stripes down the legs and weapons and clothing said to be identical in appearance to weapons and clothing used in the recently committed series of armed robberies. A blue Holden Commodore SV6 sedan belonging to Mr Amood and fitted with stolen registration plates was located in the car park adjacent to the service station. The sedan was seized and examined. Stolen NSW registration plates had been taped over the legitimate registration plates and the vehicle was found to contain disposable yellow gloves.
	
	
	Additional evidence was obtained as a result of the execution of search warrants. I have set this evidence out below in dealing with the Crown’s submissions.
	


The tendency and coincidence evidence the subject of the appeal


	
	The Crown indicated that it proposed to seek to rely on the evidence of the St Ives robbery as tendency and coincidence evidence on all counts on the indictment and the evidence in relation to each count on the indictment as tendency and coincidence evidence in respect of the other counts.
	
	
	It should be noted that the original indictment alleged three further counts of armed robbery, the evidence in respect of which was also relied on as tendency and coincidence evidence in respect of the other counts.
	
	
	In a judgment delivered on 26 October 2015, the trial judge determined that the evidence was inadmissible as tendency and coincidence evidence. Following delivery of that judgment, an amended indictment was presented which deleted the three counts to which I have referred above at [38]. However, the trial judge ruled that evidence of the St Ives robbery and evidence on each count on the amended indictment were inadmissible as tendency or coincidence evidence on the other counts.
	
	
	For convenience, I have set out as Annexures A, B and C to the judgment the amended notice of tendency evidence and coincidence evidence dated 28 October 2015 in respect of Mr Matonwal together with what is described as a Coincidence Chart in respect of each of the respondents. Similar tendency and coincidence notices were served on Mr Amood.
	


Judgments of the trial judge


	
	The trial judge delivered two relatively brief judgments. In his first judgment, delivered on 26 October 2015, the trial judge stated that the matters relied upon as tendency or coincidence evidence were a common feature of armed robberies of the nature of those in question. He pointed out that the robberies took place at various times in the evening, ranging from 8.15pm to midnight, that in each case the robbers were armed and their faces disguised and that gloves were worn as were items of clothing commonly seen in the street.
	
	
	However, the trial judge pointed to what he described as some significant differences. He noted that in some cases, the offenders wore balaclavas or a hoodie, whilst in others, their faces were obscured by t-shirts or similar material. He stated that in the case of the St Ives robbery, one of the offenders was not wearing a hoodie. He stated the wearing of balaclavas and hoodies or obscuring the face were common features of robberies of this nature.
	
	
	The trial judge referred to the different coloured gloves worn by the offenders at the various robberies. He said the wearing of gloves was a common feature of this type of robbery.
	
	
	The trial judge also pointed to the difference in the weapons used. He said the use of some form of easily accessible weapon such as a knife or meat cleaver is a frequent characteristic of robberies of the nature of those in question.
	
	
	The trial judge also stated that the use of a sports bag or backpack to carry out the proceeds is common because of the ease with which it can be carried and because it does not attract attention. He also pointed out that the motor vehicle, probably a Ford or Holden, used by the offenders was also frequently seen in Sydney as was the type of clothing worn by them.
	
	
	The trial judge also stated that the cumulative factors of the matters relied upon did not establish significant probative value because the matters relied on would be a factor in a very large number of armed robberies of service stations in Sydney.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the trial judge ruled the evidence inadmissible as tendency or coincidence evidence. He stated that the evidence, in modified form, would be before the jury in any event.
	
	
	Following that judgment, three counts on the indictment were deleted and two additional matters were relied upon. The first matter was the nature and quality of the threats made and the second matter was the fact that, in respect of the Pizza Hut incident, the unknown car referred to in the tendency and coincidence notice was substituted by reference to a blue sedan. In a judgment of 28 October, the primary judge stated, without elaboration, that this did not cause him to alter his opinion.
	


The appeal


	
	The original notice of appeal sought to appeal from the ruling of the primary judge on 26 October, which related to the 11 counts on the first indictment. Following discussion at the hearing, an amended notice of appeal was filed, dealing specifically with the ruling of 28 October 2015 in respect of the remaining 8 counts on the second indictment.
	


The legislation


	
	It is convenient to set out the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (the Act) relating to the admission of tendency and coincidence evidence:
	


“55   Relevant evidence

(1)   The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.

…

56   Relevant evidence to be admissible

(1)   Except as otherwise provided by this Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in the proceeding.

(2)   Evidence that is not relevant in the proceeding is not admissible.

…

97   The tendency rule

(1)   Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

…

(b)   the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

…

98   The coincidence rule

(1)   Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless:

…

(b)   the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value

…

101   Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1)   This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2)   Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.”

The submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that a decision on whether a judge erred in declining to admit evidence as tendency and coincidence evidence was to be determined by the application of principles set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499.
	
	
	The Crown submitted the exercise by the trial judge of his statutory functions wholly miscarried. It was submitted that the particular failure was to consider all of the items of coincidence or tendency evidence as a whole. It was submitted that, by contrast, the trial judge considered each category individually and discounted each on the basis that they were typical or common features of armed robberies.
	
	
	It was also emphasised by the Crown that the probative value had to be considered in light of other evidence to be adduced by the Crown. This was said to include:
	



	
	During the course of the St Ives robbery the two offenders (accepted to be the respondents) went into a storeroom and changed and hid their clothes once they realised that police officers had stopped outside. Those items included:
	



	
	A cream and grey reversible “Champion” brand jacket. The Crown alleges that this was similar to the jacket worn by the first offender in all of the counts on the present indictment bar the Regents Park robbery. More accurately, the first offender can be seen to be wearing such a jacket at the Kenthurst, Rouse Hill and McGraths Hill robberies and the Ermington attempted robbery.
	
	
	Hoxley brand black track pants with two white stripes running down each side. The Crown alleges that these were similar to the pants worn by the first offender at the Rouse Hill and McGraths Hill robberies and the Ermington and North Ryde attempted robberies. In my opinion, such pants are visible in the footage from Rouse Hill and Ermington.
	
	
	Two black balaclavas.
	
	
	A blue t-shirt, allegedly similar to that used as a face covering by the second offender in the Regents Park robbery.
	



	
	The Crown states that shoe imprints found at the McGraths Hill robbery were similar to the imprints of the size 10 Nike shoes which Mr Amood was wearing on arrest. This is incorrect. The police statement explicitly stated that Mr Amood’s size 10 Nike shoes did not match the imprints at the scene of the McGraths Hill robbery. However, Mr Matonwal’s size 12 Nike shoes, worn by him on arrest, did match the imprints at the scene. Furthermore, the shoes worn by the second offender, as depicted in the CCTV footage of the McGraths Hill robbery, appear to be white shoes with distinctive black writing along the side, similar to the Everlast shoes seized from Mr Amood’s house.
	
	
	The blue Commodore sedan owned by Mr Amood had yellow disposable gloves in the console.
	
	
	The Nike shoes worn by Mr Matonwal on his arrest are said to appear to be the same as the type of shoes worn by the first offender in the Kenthurst robbery. I would note that they also appear to be the same as the shoes worn by the first offender in the Regents Park, Rouse Hill and McGraths Hill robberies and the Ermington attempted robbery.
	
	
	At Mr Amood’s premises, police located: a blue “Champion” hooded jumper, similar to that worn by the second offender at Regents Park; a red hooded jumper with a white motif on the front, similar to that worn by the second offender at Rouse Hill; and Everlast shoes which appear to be the same as the type of shoes worn by the second offender in the Kenthurst robbery. I would also note that similar shoes are worn by the second offender at the Regents Park, McGraths Hill and North Ryde robberies and at the Ermington attempted robbery.
	
	
	At Mr Matonwal’s premises, police located four separate items of yellow rubber gloves in the kitchen.
	
	
	Kete Andrew, Mr Matonwal’s girlfriend, will give evidence that during the period of the robberies, Mr Amood would come to their place in the evening in his blue Commodore and Messrs Amood and Matonwal would “just leave and generally return a few hours later with Oxycontin”. In the weeks prior to their arrests, they had become “fixated on obtaining Oxycontin to feed their addictions [and t]his seemed to be the most important thing in their lives”.
	



	
	The Crown acknowledged that it bore the onus of satisfying the Court that the decision or ruling sought to be appealed from eliminates or substantially weakens the Crown case. It submitted that the effect of the ruling deprives the Crown of cogent evidence which would go to establishing the identities of the offenders.
	
	
	In supplementary submissions, the Crown noted that although in its original submissions it was stated that each respondent had pleaded guilty to the St Ives robbery, Mr Matonwal successfully applied to withdraw that plea in circumstances where he believed his plea was to an attempted armed robbery. It was submitted this did not affect the strength of the appellant’s argument. At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for Mr Matonwal accepted this to be the case.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown emphasised the importance of viewing the CCTV footage, stating it showed more clearly the clothing that each offender was wearing. She acknowledged that her coincidence case was stronger than her case on tendency evidence and made her submissions on that basis.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that in six of the armed robberies, including St Ives, one of the offenders was carrying a meat cleaver with a small hole in it and the other a knife. She stated that the silver of the knife and the hole in the meat cleaver could be seen in some of the CCTV footage.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown submitted, referring to the CCTV footage, that in every armed robbery except one, the larger person goes to the till and the smaller one deals with the attendant. She submitted that in a number of the offences, the footage shows the larger person is wearing black pants with two white stripes down the side. She submitted that although it might be true that lots of people wore such pants, on these occasions they were worn by a person who has the same height and build, in each case who happens to be committing an armed robbery and who happens to be holding a meat cleaver or a silver knife.
	
	
	Mr Amood submitted that the St Ives count was fundamental to the inquiry because the question as to the suggested probative value in regard to any comparative event necessarily looks to that count and “individually the comparative event or events sought to be the subject of the tendency reasoning”. He pointed out that the St Ives robbery took place on the North Shore whereas all the other robberies were in Sydney’s west or northwest.
	
	
	Mr Amood submitted that no error was disclosed in the evaluation by the trial judge. He submitted that opinions in relation to tendency and coincidence usage may differ between reasonable minds. He described the decision of the trial judge as highly rational and that the trial judge “clearly addressed the leading criteria of similarity and difference”.
	
	
	In relation to tendency evidence, Mr Amood submitted that it was not the purpose of s 97 to admit tendency evidence by reference to a lower test than that going to the admission of circumstantial evidence. He made the following submission:
	


“A tendency event comprises an invitation by the Crown to a jury to find the tendency event as an intermediate fact from which to infer the tendency or state of mind. But consideration as to the intermediate fact must be based upon relevant evidence which is capable of rationally affecting the probability of a fact in issue. The generalisation of specific matters through the presentation of a number of events which do no more than reflect the elements of armed robbery (and matters common to the incidental purposes of an armed robbery) do not, it is submitted, speak to the requisite ‘significant probative value’ enabling the uses of the evidence as sought.”


	
	Mr Amood also submitted that coincidence evidence is an invitation to conclude, in drawing an inference of guilt, that the least probable explanation is chance. He submitted the relationship between the St Ives incident and the remaining counts and the relationship between the counts themselves was “deficient” to attain significant probative value. Once again he submitted there was no identified error in the House v The King sense.
	
	
	Mr Amood also submitted that the Court should exercise restraint in reviewing the decision of a judge who had many years’ experience in presiding over a criminal trial.
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Amood pointed to the fact that the trial judge, at the conclusion of his judgment, stated that he considered the cumulative effect of the matters relied upon by the Crown.
	
	
	Mr Matonwal adopted both the oral and written submissions made on behalf of Mr Amood.
	


Consideration


	
	As the appeal is brought under s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act, it is necessary for the appellant to demonstrate that the ruling by the primary judge declining to admit the evidence in question as tendency or coincidence evidence substantially weakens the prosecution case. It is to be noted that if that condition is satisfied, no leave is required to bring the appeal.
	
	
	In R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228, Spigelman CJ, with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed, stated that the Court should determine the question of whether a ruling substantially weakens the Crown case by asking whether or not that would be the effect, on the assumption that the jury accepted the evidence, as long as the evidence was fit to be left to the jury. He stated it was not desirable for the Court to undertake an investigation into the weight of the evidence based on credibility or reliability considerations: at [40]. His Honour described the approach as similar to that which arises in determining the probative value of the evidence for the purpose of s 137 of the Act: at [39]. In particular, he stated that this approach involves assessing the probative value of the evidence, without taking into account issues of credibility and reliability, except where those issues are such that it would not be open to the jury to conclude that the evidence could ultimately affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue: at [61]-[65]. His Honour’s approach was held to be correct by a majority of the High Court in IMM v The Queen [2016] HCA 14; 90 ALJR 529 at [52] (IMM). It should be noted that, having regard to the nature of the evidence sought to be tendered as coincidence or tendency evidence in the present case, no issue of credibility or reliability arises.
	
	
	The respondents did not contest that the refusal to admit the evidence substantially weakened the prosecution case. In my opinion, they were correct not to do so. The evidence, if admitted, either as tendency or coincidence evidence, would, for the reasons subsequently set out, have significant probative value.
	
	
	Both parties appeared to accept that the appellate review was to be carried out in accordance with the principles in House v The King. This was consistent with the view expressed by Simpson J, with whom Schmidt J agreed, in DAO v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568 and, at least in relation to appeals from interlocutory judgments under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act (including an appeal from an evidentiary ruling under s 5F(3A)), that of Spigelman CJ and Allsop P, with whom Kirby J agreed: at [56]-[60], [70] (Spigelman CJ), [79]-[81] (Allsop P), [151], [157], [178] (Simpson J), [211] (Kirby J), [212] (Schmidt J). As I am of the opinion that the trial judge did fall into what might be described as House v The King error, it is not necessary to deal with this matter any further.
	
	
	It is convenient to deal first with the admissibility of the evidence as coincidence evidence. In DSJ v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758 (DSJ), Whealy JA, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated that the first question to be asked was whether the evidence was relevant, that is, whether, having regard to the provisions of s 55 of the Act, it could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings: at [53]. In his judgment, Whealy JA, at [62], cited with approval, subject to one relevant qualification, the following passage from the judgment of Simpson J in R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; 158 A Crim R 504 at [139]:
	


“[139] … The analysis is no different in the case of evidence tendered under s 98. The principles are these:

(i)   coincidence evidence is not to be admitted if the court thinks that evidence would not, either by itself, or having regard to other evidence already adduced, or anticipated, have significant probative value;

(ii)   probative value is the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue (see the Dictionary to the Evidence Act);

(iii)   the actual probative value to be assigned to any item of evidence is a question for the tribunal of fact – here, the jury;

(iv)   the probative value actually to be assigned to any item of evidence cannot finally be determined until all of the evidence in the case is complete;

(v)   the task of the judge in determining whether to admit evidence tendered as coincidence evidence is therefore essentially an evaluative and predictive one. The judge is required, firstly, to determine whether the evidence is capable of rationally affecting the probability of the existence of a fact in issue; secondly (if that determination is affirmative) to evaluate, in the light of any evidence already adduced, and evidence that is anticipated, the likelihood that the jury would assign the evidence significant (in the sense explained by Hunt CJ at CL in Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457) probative value. If the evaluation results in a conclusion that the jury would be likely to assign the evidence significant probative value, the evidence is admissible. If the assessment is otherwise, s 98 mandates that the evidence is not to be admitted.”


	
	The qualification was that, in conducting the evaluative and predictive process referred to in subpar (v) of the passage, the court may have regard to the possibility that from a consideration of all the Crown’s evidence (including the coincidence evidence), there emerges a real possibility of an explanation inconsistent with guilt and then the court must ask whether that possibility substantially alters its view of “the otherwise significant capacity of the coincidence evidence to establish the fact or facts in issue”: at [79]-[80]. In my judgment in DSJ, I explained that the task is to be performed having regard to all the evidence sought to be relied on by the party seeking to tender the coincidence evidence: at [10], Allsop P and McCallum J agreeing.
	
	
	In R v Gale; R v Duckworth [2012] NSWCCA 174; 217 A Crim R 487, Simpson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Fullerton J agreed, summarised the approach to be adopted as follows:
	


“[30]   The factual underpinnings of the s 98 decision to admit or reject coincidence evidence are:

that there is evidence capable of establishing the occurrence of two or more events; and

that there is evidence capable of establishing similarities in the two or more events; or

that there is evidence capable of establishing similarities in the circumstances in which two or more events occurred;

that there is evidence capable of establishing both similarities in the two or more events and similarities in the circumstances in which the two events occurred.

[31]   In a case in which it is found that there is such evidence, then, in my opinion, the correct process in the determination of the admission of evidence under s 98 involves a series of steps, as follows:

the first step is to identify the ‘particular act of a person’ or the ‘particular state of mind of a person’ that the party tendering the evidence seeks to prove;

the second step is to identify the ‘two or more events’ from the occurrence of which the party tendering the evidence seeks to prove that the person in question did the ‘particular act’ or had the ‘particular state of mind’;

the third step is to identify the ‘similarities in the events’ and/or the ‘similarities in the circumstances in which the events occurred’ by reason of which the party tendering the evidence asserts the improbability of coincidental occurrence of the events;

the fourth step is to determine whether ‘reasonable notice’ has been given of the intention to adduce the evidence (or, if reasonable notice has not been given, whether a direction under s 100(2) ought to be given, dispensing with the requirement);

the fifth step is to make an evaluation whether the evidence will, either by itself or in conjunction with other evidence already given or anticipated, ‘have significant probative value’;

in a criminal proceeding, if it is determined that the evidence would have ‘significant probative value’, the sixth step is the determination whether the probative value of the evidence ‘substantially outweighs’ any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant (s 101(2)).

the sixth step necessarily involves some analysis both of the probative value of the evidence in question and any prejudicial effect it might have: R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413, and a balancing of the two.”


	
	Further, as was pointed out in R v MR [2013] NSWCCA 236, it is necessary to give consideration to the evidence sought to be tendered as a whole, rather than separate consideration of each particular circumstance relied upon: at [9]-[10] (Schmidt J), [78]-[79] (Beech-Jones J).
	
	
	The amended notice of coincidence evidence, which is Annexure B to the judgment, states that the events the subject of the proposed evidence are the offences grounding the 8 counts in the indictment and the St Ives robbery and that it is tendered to prove the respondents’ participation in the robberies. The similarities in the robberies were summarised in the coincidence chart, which is Annexure C to this judgment. Relevant similarities are set out in par [5] of the coincidence notice.
	
	
	The trial judge dealt with each of the individual similarities separately. Although I have pointed out (see above at [46]) that he stated that the cumulative factor did not establish significant probative evidence, his conclusion on this point is not supported by any analysis. However, even if he did take into account the matters relied upon on a cumulative basis, it is clear that in reaching his conclusion, he did not take account of the other evidence relied upon by the Crown. I have set out that evidence above at [53]. It is evident that these matters are of relevance in considering whether the proposed coincidence evidence has significant probative value. The trial judge, in my respectful opinion, was in error in failing to take that evidence into account.
	
	
	It is thus necessary for this Court to consider whether the evidence should be admitted as coincidence evidence. Although little attention was paid to this matter, it seems to me that the evidence in question was relevant to each count. The similarities, for example, in the size of the offenders compared to the respondents, the weapons used, the means of disguise, the similarity of clothing worn and the vehicle used are relevant in the sense described in s 55 of the Act as establishing that the respondents, who admittedly were involved in the St Ives robbery, were involved in the other robberies in question. These factors were also relevant in establishing that the same persons committed the robberies, a matter which could form the basis for an inference that the offenders were the respondents.
	
	
	However, it is necessary to show that the evidence had significant probative value. In IMM, the majority, citing J D Heydon, Cross on Evidence (10th ed 2015, Lexis Nexis) at 763 with approval, made the following comment concerning significant probative value, at [46]:
	


“[46]   Cross on Evidence suggests that a ‘significant’ probative value is a probative value which is ‘important’ or ‘of consequence’. The significance of the probative value of the tendency evidence under s 97(1)(b) must depend on the nature of the facts in issue to which the evidence is relevant and the significance or importance which that evidence may have in establishing those facts. So understood, the evidence must be influential in the context of fact-finding.”


	
	Although these comments were made in the course of considering s 97(1)(b) of the Act, they apply with equal force to the meaning of significant probative value in s 98(1)(b).
	
	
	It is convenient first to consider whether the similarities between the St Ives robbery and the charged offences lead to the conclusion that the evidence in relation to that robbery has significant probative value in proving that the respondents committed the other offences. I have considered this issue with the benefit of having reviewed the CCTV footage for each offence.
	
	
	The respondents were apprehended whilst in the course of committing the St Ives robbery. The evidence in relation to this robbery included not only the CCTV footage but also the actual items of clothing worn by the respondents.
	
	
	The CCTV footage shows that the weapons used were a meat cleaver with a hole in it and a black handle and a silver knife with a black handle. A review of the CCTV footage of the other robberies shows that identical weapons were used at the robberies at Regents Park, North Ryde, Kenthurst and Rouse Hill.
	
	
	In addition, yellow gloves were used by both of the offenders at Regents Park, Kenthurst, Ermington and McGraths Hill, and by one of the offenders at the Rouse Hill and North Ryde robberies. As I pointed out, four pairs of yellow gloves were found at Mr Matonwal’s premises and yellow gloves were found in the console of Mr Amood’s blue Commodore sedan.
	
	
	In addition, the jacket worn by Mr Matonwal in the St Ives robbery appears similar to that which was worn by the first offender at Kenthurst. This jacket was seized, and when reversed, it can be seen to be the “Champion” brand jacket worn by the first offender in the McGraths Hill and Rouse Hill robberies and Ermington attempted robbery. The shoes worn by Mr Matonwal were of similar appearance to those worn by the first offender at the Regents Park, Kenthurst, Rouse Hill and McGraths Hill robberies and the Ermington attempted robbery.
	
	
	Unlike the robberies to which I have referred above, the only weapon clearly depicted in the CCTV footage at the McGraths Hill robbery was a meat cleaver with a hole and a black handle. However, once again, yellow gloves were used and the same “Champion” brand jacket was worn by the first offender. Further, shoe imprints similar to the imprint of the Nike shoes worn by Mr Matonwal on arrest were found at the site of the McGraths Hill robbery. In addition, silver duct tape found in the McGraths Hill Service Station contained Mr Matonwal’s DNA.
	
	
	It should also be noted that in each of the robberies to which I have referred, the offenders, as depicted on the CCTV footage, seem to be of similar height and build to the respondents, as depicted in the CCTV footage of the St Ives robbery.
	
	
	In these circumstances, in my opinion, the similarities between the St Ives robbery and the robberies at Regents Park, Kenthurst, Rouse Hill, McGraths Hill and North Ryde means that the evidence of each of the robberies would have significant probative value in establishing that each of them was committed by the respondents.
	
	
	Although the position is not as clear, I am of the view the evidence relating to the Ermington attempted robbery has significant probative value in proving that the respondents committed the robberies I have referred to above at [86]. The Ermington attempted robbery occurred one day before the McGraths Hill robbery and three days after the Rouse Hill robbery. On each occasion similar gloves, shoes and distinctive “Champion” brand jacket with a grey hoodie underneath were worn by the first offender.
	
	
	However, I am unable to reach the same conclusion in respect of the attempted robberies at North Ryde or Dundas. Whilst the CCTV footage of both offences depicts the offenders wearing jackets and pants which bear a similarity to the jackets and pants of the offenders in robberies committed later that night (the Rouse Hill and St Ives robberies respectively), it does not seem to me that that similarity, without more, means the evidence of those offences would have significant probative value in respect of the other offences. It does not seem to me that the fact that the motor vehicle used in the Dundas attempted robbery appears possibly to be similar to that used in the other robberies leads to a contrary conclusion.
	
	
	In the result, the evidence of the St Ives robbery, the evidence of the Regents Park robbery (Count 1), the North Ryde robbery (Count 2), the Kenthurst robbery (Count 3), the Rouse Hill robbery (Count 5), the Ermington attempted robbery (Count 6) and the McGraths Hill robbery (Count 7) are admissible as evidence on each of these counts having significant probative value for the purpose of s 98 of the Act. However, the trial judge was correct in ruling that the evidence of the North Ryde attempted robbery (Count 4) and the Dundas attempted robbery (Count 8) was inadmissible as coincidence evidence on the other counts.
	
	
	There was no contention that s 101 of the Act operated to exclude the evidence.
	
	
	Further, as the evidence has significant probative value, it follows that its exclusion substantially weakens the prosecution case for the purposes of s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	However, I do not think that the evidence on each count is admissible under s 97 of the Act to show the tendencies referred to in the amended tendency notice, which is Annexure A to this judgment. For the evidence in question to be used as tendency evidence, it would need to be established beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence in respect of each robbery, which I have outlined above, not only showed that there was a tendency for some persons to commit robberies with each other whilst, for example, wearing gloves and using particular sorts of weapons, but also that the persons committing the robberies were the respondents. Even if it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that one of the robberies was committed by the respondents, that in my view would not establish a tendency to commit other robberies or the tendencies set out in the amended tendency notice.
	


Conclusion


	
	In the result, the appeal should be allowed in part. I would make the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal allowed in part.
	
	
	Rule that the evidence referred to in par 3 of the amended notice of coincidence evidence, dated 28 October 2015, so far as it relates to the armed robbery at the Caltex Service Station St Ives on 12 May 2014 and the offences the subjects of Counts 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 in the indictment, presented against the respondents on 28 October 2015, is admissible as coincidence evidence on each of those counts.
	
	
	Otherwise dismiss the appeal.

2428685,R v Hosseiniamraei [2016] NSWSC 1181,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Leila Alavi was a 26 year old woman who was born in Iran. She and her sister Mitra left Iran seeking a better way of life, away from violence. She lived in Turkey for a few years where she met and married Mokhtar Hosseiniamraei in 2010. They came to Australia later that year. Mitra followed two years later and was the only other member of the family who lived here.
	
	
	Mitra described Leila as ""beautiful and kind"". They saw each other every day and loved shopping and eating together. Marjan Lotfi, another sister who lived in the United States of America, described her as a ""loving and kind person who was always laughing with her friends"". She was looking forward to Leila coming to visit her.
	
	
	Leila was brutally killed by her husband on 17 January 2015.
	
	
	Mr Hosseiniamraei (“the offender”) has pleaded guilty to the murder of Ms Alavi. It is a crime that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of 20 years. These are legislative guideposts to which I must have regard along with all of the facts and circumstances of the case.
	


Facts

Background


	
	The offender, who was also born in Iran, met Ms Alavi in Turkey 2009 and they were married in 2010. They came to Australia that same year and lived at Toongabbie. During the course of their relationship there were arguments and, on occasions, the offender was physically violent towards her. They generally resumed their relationship after such events. However, it would seem from some statements tendered in the defence case that Ms Alavi moved out in about August 2014.
	
	
	On 25 October 2014 Ms Alavi reported an incident to Auburn police. She told them that the offender had said to her in a telephone call, “You’re a slut, I’m going to kill you and I’m going to fix up your sister and friends who have been teaching you this”. An Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (“ADVO”) was made which included conditions that the offender not assault, molest, harass, threaten, interfere, intimidate or stalk Ms Alavi.
	
	
	After Ms Alavi had moved out of the Toongabbie home she went to live with a relative. At some stage the offender also moved out and went to live with his sister and brother-in-law at West Guildford. He started working with his brother-in-law in his painting business.
	
	
	Ironically, it would seem that despite the past violence and the threat to kill in October, Ms Alavi still cared for the offender's well-being. After they separated she still kept in contact; performed domestic chores for him; and in the days or weeks before she was killed she expressed genuine concern for his mental health.
	


The murder


	
	Ms Alavi worked as a hair dresser at Benjamin’s Hair Studio in Auburn Shopping Village. She often parked her car in the underground car park beneath it when she was at work.
	
	
	In the early afternoon of Friday 16 January 2015 Ms Alavi spoke to the offender on her phone while she was at work. She became visibly upset and told a colleague that the offender had threatened her. She said, “He said he is going to kill me and all of us. Probably he is watching too many movies”. She contacted her telephone service provider soon after and changed her number, telling a friend that this was in order to prevent the offender from contacting her.
	
	
	Statements tendered in the defence case indicate that the offender was supposed to go to work on a painting job on Saturday 17 January 2015 with his brother-in-law and his (the latter's) father but he did not turn up.
	
	
	At about 9.25am that day, Ms Alavi was at work and attending to a client. She became aware of the offender’s presence in the shopping centre. She stopped what she was doing and a fellow employee took over. She said that she was going to speak to the offender and she was last seen walking down a ramp which leads into the underground parking lot.
	
	
	When she had not returned after about 20 minutes a co-worker went to look for her. Ultimately she came across Ms Alavi’s car in the underground car park and found Ms Alavi sitting in the driver’s seat with a large amount of blood around her head and shoulders. The co-worker ran, calling for help. Police and an ambulance came. Ms Alavi was confirmed as deceased.
	
	
	An autopsy examination by a forensic pathologist revealed that Ms Alavi had died as a result of multiple stab wounds caused by scissors. There were 56 wounds in total to the face; the front, back and right side of the neck; the left arm/shoulder; and a particularly high number over the upper front of the chest. Numerous defensive injuries were present on both hands.
	
	
	The offender was found in Guildford West that evening. He was arrested and he participated in an interview with the assistance of an interpreter. In short, he admitted that he had killed his wife although at no stage did he really explain what had happened and why he had stabbed her so brutally and so many times. He said that it occurred after they had sat in her car and spoken for some unspecified time. When asked to describe the manner in which he had used the scissors he said, ""I was angry. I cannot recall."" Earlier in the interview when asked how Ms Alavi was when he left her he said, ""I don't know. I was angry"".
	
	
	He told police that he had travelled by bus from Merrylands to Auburn that morning. He obtained a pair of scissors by taking them from a supermarket in Auburn a short time before the incident. He took them because, ""maybe I wanted to hit myself, I don't know"". He said he was meeting up with Ms Alavi because he needed work clothes from her car.
	
	
	The offender said, in effect, that he had not eaten for 10 days and he had had nowhere to sleep in that time. He referred to the authorities having provided help to his wife but not to him. He spoke of living ""in the jungle""; he clarified that he meant at Parramatta Lake. He said, ""I live like an animal in the jungle because you haven't, and you didn't give me a place to live"". He also spoke of being at a mental hospital; having depression; crying day and night; and that it had been six months since his wife had left him.
	
	
	The offender said that he spoke with his wife every day on the phone, the last occasion being the day before. They saw each other once or twice a week. He had last seen her at a football game (Iran v Qatar at ANZ Stadium) two days before.
	
	
	At various points in the interview he explained why he had killed his wife:
	


Q 52   Why did you hit her?

A   Because, um, when we marry um, we have commitment, moral commitment towards one another. In this country this means nothing. For us it is very important your wife to be with you, your partner or wife to be with you until you divorce her, until you haven't divorce her.

Q62   Where did you hit her with the scissors on her body?

A   In her heart and in her neck. Because she did not obey the rule of the marriage. Is she alive?

Q113   Why did you kill Leila?

A   Because we were married and before divorce urn, she broke the contract. I could not tolerate it. … And ah, I could not forget it … I love her very much.

Q189   So when you were in the car talking with Leila, what is it that she said that made you mad?

A   It's like, that I am not her husband. She didn't care for me. She answer back with, ah, to me.

Q190   So when she answered back to [you] how did that make [you] feel?

A   How, how a man if he is a man ah, would feel when a [woman] answer her, answer him back like that.

Q191   Is that when you struck Leila with the scissors?

A   Certainly should be like that.

Q220   What made you hurt Leila instead [of] hurting yourself?

A   Maybe it was her reaction or the way she was behaving. I don't know.


	
	The recording of the interview was tendered at the sentence hearing in addition to the transcript. Mr Smith SC for the offender sought to demonstrate that at various stages of the interview his client became quite emotional. He submitted that this would put into context some of the things that were said. Two things were particularly apparent from my viewing of the recording. First, it seems the offender was unaware that Ms Alavi had died until at Q64 he was told that she had passed away. Immediately, and at various stages thereafter, he was quite emotional, sobbing and putting his head down onto his arm which was on the table in front of him. I take this to indicate that the enormity of what he had done was registering with him. Secondly, when stating the various things I have just quoted, his physical demeanour (as limited as it can be judged when speaking through an interpreter) appeared to be quite clear and assertive.
	
	
	After the interview the offender was taken to hospital to obtain anti-depressant medication. While there he began to complain of pain and was provided with treatment. He was then returned to the police station. In addition to his admissions, DNA analysis of various relevant items established a strong case that the offender was Ms Alavi’s killer.
	


Other offences to be taken into account on a Form 1


	
	The offender has asked that when he is sentenced for the offence of murder I take into account his guilt in respect of four further offences which I will detail shortly. I confirm that I will do so.
	
	
	The first is the contravention of the ADVO. I have taken into account as an aggravating feature of the murder that the offender was, by court order, not even supposed to assault (etcetera) Ms Alavi so this offence should not lead to any further increase in the sentence.
	
	
	The other three offences concern a completely unrelated incident that occurred on 15 December 2014 when the offender was at the Parramatta branch of Housing NSW seeking accommodation. He behaved in a hostile, aggressive and abusive manner towards staff who were simply trying to do their job in helping disadvantaged members of the community. In the course of all of this he caused some (relatively minor) property damage. The offences are one of behaving in an offensive manner in a public place and two of recklessly damaging property. Without intending to downplay the horrible experience he imposed upon the staff of Housing NSW, in the scheme of things these offences are relatively minor in comparison to the primary offence.
	


The offender's background and personal circumstances


	
	The offender was born in Iran in 1981 and so he was aged 33 at the time of the offences. He has no previous criminal convictions. For that reason he must be regarded as a person of otherwise prior good character, but that is tempered by the undisputed fact of his prior physical violence towards the deceased.
	
	
	His father was a farmer and his mother a housewife. He has two sisters and two brothers. He completed 10th grade of schooling at the age of 17 and served in the military. He is of the Baha'i faith and, like other people of that faith in a predominantly conservative Islamic country, he and his family experienced animosity, discrimination and prejudice including in education, employment and their general ability to interact and function in society.
	
	
	The offender met a woman in about 2005 and they began dating. She was from a conservative Muslim family so they had to keep their relationship a secret. After a year he thought it would be appropriate to inform the family, otherwise they could never get married. From that point he did not see this woman for two or three months; he later learnt that she had been mistreated by her family as a result of the relationship. They met up again and she came to live with him but after a short time her family came and took her away. Prompted by this experience the offender decided to leave Iran in October 2007 and sought asylum in Turkey. It was there that he met the deceased and they married on 20 January 2010. They came to Australia later that year.
	
	
	The offender was seen by Dr Richard Furst, consultant forensic psychiatrist, on 24 June 2015 and on 9 June 2016. Dr Furst's report of 7 July 2016 included an account of the offender's life in Iran and Turkey that is consistent with what I have set out above.
	
	
	The offender told Dr Furst that he had felt depressed and hopeless in his teens and early 20’s and that there were self-harming and suicide attempts in Iran and in Turkey. After arriving in Australia he was unable to find work and he developed further symptoms of depression. He was admitted to Cumberland Hospital from 10 to 19 November 2014 after his mood deteriorated following the breakdown of his marriage; he was depressed and had suicidal thoughts. He said that he was essentially homeless after being discharged and was living rough in the Parramatta area. Later in the report it is said that he was sleeping “on the streets” for some days around Christmas 2014 and felt like a burden on his sister who he had been living with in Guildford.
	
	
	The offender also told Dr Furst of having a significant drug problem. He smoked hashish in Iran from the age of 16 and used morphine from the age of 19. He smoked cannabis and used the drug known as “ice” in Turkey. In Australia he was using heroin and cannabis daily and ice on most days. He was taking Oxycontin for which he did not have a prescription. He was also gambling.
	
	
	As to the killing of his wife, the offender said that he “gave up and decided to commit suicide” on 17 January 2015. Dr Furst quotes him as having said, “There was nothing left for me. I had no life”. He said he was crying, could not sleep and felt lonely. He had “lost everything, my wife, my life”.
	
	
	However, he was unable to explain why his apparent depression and suicidal thoughts resulted in the death of his wife. He said, “I don’t know. Suddenly everything changed.” He claimed that he had brought the scissors with him to kill himself.
	
	
	He is said to have “regretted his actions”, saying that he had lost everything; he loved her; he wished he had killed himself; and that he cried every night.
	
	
	The offender has been on prescribed medication since being in custody for his depressive symptoms and to help him sleep. He reported that his mood had improved. He said he accepted and admitted his actions. He said, “I feel sinful. A burden. A scar. I feel dead. A human being lost their life. Why wouldn’t I be sorry? … How can I look into my parents’ eyes? Her parents’ eyes? It’s very difficult.”
	
	
	To specific questioning by Dr Furst, the offender maintained that his wife was not obeying the “rule of marriage”. He believed that she had “used him” to come to Australia. He said, “All the things she did. Difficult circumstances. That’s what created depression for me … in my culture, you don’t normally talk about your wife’s betrayal.” He felt “pushed” by her apparent “betrayal” and her actions in taking out an ADVO.
	
	
	Dr Furst reported that the offender claimed to have been abstinent from drugs while in custody and did not want to use them again. He was open to engaging in counselling or other programs in custody to address his offending. He wanted to “compensate for what I did” by trying to help society.
	
	
	Dr Furst reviewed the medical records of Cumberland Hospital in relation to the offender’s admission in November 2014. They included that he felt depressed and hopeless, apparently in a reaction to his wife leaving him and taking out an ADVO a month before. Various diagnoses were indicated by the treating doctors. One doctor interviewed Ms Alavi who said that she left the offender because of domestic violence; that he had a history of substance abuse; and that he had been self-harming in the past. Notwithstanding this she visited him while he was in the hospital.
	
	
	Dr Furst also reviewed records of a medical centre the offender attended following his discharge from Cumberland. Treatment with Avanza and Seroquel were continued. He was referred to a psychologist. The records of Justice Health of psychiatric assessments and treatments after the offender came into custody confirmed, amongst other things, continuing symptoms of depression but continued treatment with prescribed medication.
	
	
	Dr Furst made diagnoses of chronic dysthymia; borderline personality disorder; substance use disorder; and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. He considered that the offender did not meet criteria for diagnosis of a major mental illness such as bipolar affective disorder or a major depressive disorder. The offender’s use of drugs was thought to have probably exacerbated his underlying mood problems, personality dysfunction and adjustment difficulties. There were no indications of an intellectual disability or that the offender was mentally ill.
	
	
	A particular portion of Dr Furst’s report bears quoting:
	


“The available history and his comments to police after his arrest suggest he felt that his deceased wife Leila had violated the ‘moral commitment’ they had towards one another, her perceived betrayal making things intolerable for Mr Hosseiniamraei. He was clearly angry towards his wife at the time of the offence, reflected in the threats towards her prior to her death and the frenzied attack upon the victim with 56 stab wounds to [the] head, neck, torso, left shoulder and upper arm.

Although his depression and unstable personality disorder probably contributed to his anger and offending behaviour, non-psychotic motivations of anger, jealousy, feeling dishonored and revenge were probably more relevant in terms of his motivations and moral culpability. He continues to refer to his actions as an ‘accident’ that was out of his control, notwithstanding some expressions of regret and remorse.”


	
	As to the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation, Dr Furst considered that they were “reasonable in the circumstances, notwithstanding the obvious serious nature of his offence”. Although now abstinent from drugs of abuse, he considered that therapy, treatment and rehabilitation programs were required. Treatment such as the Violent Offenders Treatment Program and/or individual counselling with a clinical psychologist was required in relation to his attitudes towards women, impulsivity, anger issues and his emotional instability generally. English classes, vocational training and work programs would also be of benefit to him. Dr Furst thought that the offender was amenable to undergoing such programs and treatment.
	
	
	Following his arrest the offender was held at the Metropolitan Special Programs Centre. An incident occurred there in the showers on 21 March 2015 when he was assaulted by three Polynesian inmates apparently because of the charge that he faced. He was taken to hospital and diagnosed with a broken nose, a cut eye requiring stitches and suspected deep bruising of the chest. He was transferred to a protective custody environment, albeit one of the less restrictive forms of such (SMAP).
	


Seriousness of the offence of murder


	
	The Crown did not contend that the murder fell within the worst category of cases which would warrant consideration being given to imposing the maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. That concession is both fair and reasonable.
	
	
	It was, however, submitted by the Crown Prosecutor that the offence was above the middle of the range in terms of its objective seriousness. Five features were said to support that assessment but only one of them was really controversial. That was the Crown’s submission that the murder was not impulsive but was preceded by the threats to kill about three months before and on the day before. There was also the fact that the offender had travelled to Ms Alavi's place of work that morning and acquired a pair of scissors on the way.
	
	
	Mr Smith SC accepted that it was open to find that his client acted with an intention to kill. But it was his submission that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt (and the fact that matters adverse to the offender must be proved to that standard is important) that such an intention was formed prior to the offender being in the shopping centre, or in the deceased’s car. He referred to a number of aspects of evidence that supported his submission but I need not refer to them because I accept it.
	
	
	I accept that the offender had made threats in the past. But the evidence is not such that I could be satisfied that the killing of the deceased was something that was seriously planned or premeditated. In making the previous threats, it must be the case that he had thought of the prospect. But his thinking seems to have been quite chaotic in the weeks and days leading up to 17 January 2015. It seems more likely that an actual intention to kill Ms Alavi only really crystallised on the morning of 17 January 2015. That does not make the crime any less serious. It was a terrible crime that would have been worse if there was evidence that established beyond reasonable doubt that it was planned in advance.
	
	
	Mr Smith SC also made a submission that I would not be satisfied that the intention was formed before the offender and the deceased were in the car. However, he prefaced it be saying ""it may matter little"" and I think that is right.
	
	
	He conceded on his client's behalf that ""this is a serious case of murder because of, at least, the manner in which the deceased died, the use of the weapon and the fact that it was committed in the context of an estranged domestic relationship"". He submitted that the objective seriousness of the offence is at or about the mid-range.
	
	
	The number of stabs, coupled with the fact that they were predominantly directed towards vital parts of the deceased's body in what must have been a ferocious attack, indicates that the offender's intention can only have been to kill and not simply to cause serious harm. It should be borne in mind as well that he was a larger man attacking a slightly built defenceless woman who posed no threat to him. It was carried out in a confined space from which she had no chance of escape. Her dying moments must have been utterly terrifying.
	
	
	In my assessment, the objective seriousness of this offence is more than contended on behalf of the offender. In the scheme of things it is not at or near the worst case category but it is above the middle of the range.
	


Moral culpability


	
	In addressing the offender's moral culpability, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that, whilst there was evidence of occasions after the separation when the offender and the deceased appeared to engage amicably, this should be seen ""in terms of the dynamics of the relationship, … a man who was quite happy when she did as he expected her to do, but who resorted to violence when she failed to meet those unrealistic and quite improper expectations"". The example cited was the occasion when the pair attended a football match on 15 January 2015. I accept that there is force in the submission.
	
	
	The offender's moral culpability is less than it otherwise might be on account of his mental condition as described by Dr Furst. But, having regard to what Dr Furst said in the passage from his report that I have quoted, this is not to any great extent. He killed his estranged wife in the most callous and brutal circumstances and in the context of a history of physical violence and threats to kill her. He was not deterred by being subject to an ADVO. His attempt to justify his actions by blaming Ms Alavi for her disobedience of the ""rule of marriage"" which he said he ""could not tolerate"" discloses a breathtakingly arrogant and misogynistic attitude towards the right of his wife to choose her own destiny.
	


Other matters affecting the assessment of sentence


	
	I accept that the offender regrets causing the death of the deceased. In a legal sense he has accepted responsibility. I am unable to find that he is genuinely remorseful, however, having regard to what I have just said about his attitude of holding her as partly blameworthy.
	
	
	It is a statutory mitigating factor if an offender has ""good"" prospects of rehabilitation. In this case there is the opinion of Dr Furst that such prospects are ""reasonable"". That was said after the doctor noted that the offender appeared motivated to engage in counselling and programs and after he set out quite a number that the offender should engage in. I accept Dr Furst's opinion, qualified as it was. The offender did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings and so I am not placed in a better position to assess the offender's motivation to seek treatment and engage in rehabilitation programs.
	
	
	Dr Furst was not prepared to offer anything definitive on the offender's risk of reoffending. He indicated that when an offender is facing a lengthy sentence for murder such a prediction is fraught with difficulty. Much will depend upon the offender's progress in custody over a substantial period of time.
	
	
	The offender's early plea of guilty is something that I am required to take into account. In accordance with accepted sentencing practice it will produce the result that the sentence will be 25 per cent less than it otherwise would have been.
	
	
	General deterrence is a matter of great significance in a case such as this. It is ever so slightly reduced commensurate with the offender's slightly reduced moral culpability on account of his mental condition.
	
	
	The Courts must consistently denounce crimes of serious violence such as this in no uncertain terms. Those who feel that they are entitled to take advantage of a position of power and dominance in an intimate relationship must know that violence fuelled by anger, jealousy, feelings of being dishonoured, revenge or the like will be severely punished.
	
	
	Personal deterrence is also of significance as are the other purposes of sentencing of adequate punishment and making the offender accountable for what he has done.
	
	
	Mr Smith SC submitted that the non-parole period of the sentence should be reduced on account of this being the offender’s first time in custody; the onerous conditions of his custody; and the need for a longer period of parole supervision. I have considered that submission. However I am of the view that the parole period I have in mind will be more than adequate to address the last aspect. The other aspects are matters I have taken into account in the assessment of the overall sentence.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since his arrest and so his sentence must be backdated to 17 January 2015.
	


Family victim impact statements


	
	Sentencing proceedings for serious crimes like this necessarily focus a lot on the nature and seriousness of the offence and upon the personal circumstances of the offender. The law requires that. But there is another aspect that should not be ever forgotten. Statements by Mitra Alavi and Marjan Lotfi have informed me of the depth of their sense of grief over the senseless loss of their much-loved sister Leila. They have suffered terribly and will continue to do so. They have my most sincere sympathy.
	


Sentence

Convicted.

For the murder of Leila Alavi (and taking into account four further offences), sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 15 years 9 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 5 years 3 months.

The sentence will date from 17 January 2015. The non-parole period will expire on 16 October 2030 and the total term will expire on 16 January 2036. The offender will become eligible for release on parole at the end of the non-parole period.

That is a total sentence of 21 years. Without the early plea of guilty it would have been a sentence of 28 years.

2428769,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 57) [2016] NSWSC 1207,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION


	
	On 1 February 2016 Glen Patrick McNamara (“McNamara”) and Roger Caleb Rogerson (“Rogerson”) each pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging:
	



	
	the murder of Jamie Gao (“the deceased”) on 20 May 2014 (Count 1); and
	
	
	the supply, between 20 May 2014 and 24 May 2014, of a prohibited drug, namely 2.78 kilograms of methylamphetamine, in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that drug (Count 3).
	



	
	Count 2 in the indictment was brought against Rogerson only and alleged, as an alternative to count 1, an offence of being an accessory after the fact to the murder (by McNamara) of the deceased.
	
	
	On 15 June 2016, following a trial of some 4½ months, McNamara and Rogerson were each found guilty of counts 1 and 3 in the indictment.
	
	
	The offence of murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment. The offence of supplying a prohibited drug in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity also carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The Crown case, which the jury clearly accepted, was that the offenders had engaged in a joint criminal enterprise to kill the deceased, and to steal a large quantity of drugs from him for profit. Each offender denied the existence of, and any participation in, the joint criminal enterprise alleged by the Crown.
	
	
	In summary, McNamara’s case was that having met the deceased in the early part of 2014, the deceased informed him that he (the deceased) was in a position to provide information about the operation of Asian crime gangs. McNamara asserted that he had formed an intention to publish a book on that subject, and that all of his subsequent association with the deceased was to further that purpose.
	
	
	McNamara and Rogerson were previously known to one another. According to McNamara, he was contacted by Rogerson in about April of 2014 and asked to go and look at some furniture in a storage unit. McNamara asserted that he later discussed with Rogerson the sale of that furniture.
	
	
	McNamara said that at a subsequent meeting with the deceased at the Meridian Hotel at Hurstville, the deceased had informed him that he (the deceased) had been accused of stealing $130,000.00, and that his lawyers had advised him that Rogerson could assist him. According to McNamara, the deceased informed him in about mid-May 2014 that he was concerned that members of Asian crime gangs had been following him, and that as a consequence he had become fearful that such persons had also become aware of the fact that McNamara was in the process of writing a book about them.
	
	
	McNamara said that the deceased confirmed these fears with him in a meeting on 19 May 2014. He said that at this meeting, the deceased had said that he would call McNamara the following morning to let him know, in effect, that he was safe. McNamara also stated that the deceased had said on that occasion that he (the deceased) was to meet with Rogerson on the following day. On McNamara’s account, the deceased invited him to the meeting with Rogerson. McNamara maintained that he declined the invitation, and advised the deceased that he too should not go.
	
	
	McNamara told the jury that on the morning of 20 May 2014 he spoke with Rogerson and informed him that he was worried about the deceased, and that in his (McNamara’s) view, Rogerson should not go to any meeting. Later that day, McNamara travelled to Padstow. He said that this was in response to Rogerson telling him that he was to meet the deceased there. On McNamara’s account, Rogerson told him to wait at McDonalds at Padstow, and that once Rogerson had finished his meeting with the deceased, he would “drop him back” to McNamara. According to McNamara, whilst waiting at that location, the deceased entered the rear of his vehicle, telling McNamara that Asian gang members had been chasing him all day, and advising him that on Rogerson’s instructions, he was to drive to the premises of Rent-a-Space which were nearby. McNamara did so, and he and the deceased entered a storage unit, with Rogerson entering a short time thereafter.
	
	
	According to McNamara, when Rogerson entered the storage unit he asked the deceased for “the gear”, to which the deceased replied that he wanted “money first”. The effect of McNamara’s account was that such conversation, which was obviously about drugs, came as a complete surprise. McNamara said that after some further words were exchanged, the deceased produced a knife, following which Rogerson produced a gun and shot the deceased twice. According to McNamara, he was hiding under a table within the storage unit when this occurred. McNamara asserted that he questioned Rogerson about why he had shot the deceased, following which Rogerson threatened him with death, and threatened the safety of members of his family. Whilst McNamara conceded that he engaged in certain conduct over the ensuing days, he denied being a party to any joint criminal enterprise, and asserted that everything he did on and from the time at which the deceased was shot, was done under duress.
	
	
	Rogerson, who admitted having known McNamara for some years, said that he and McNamara had spoken about his proposed book on the subject of Asian crime gangs. Rogerson said McNamara had later told him about meeting with the deceased, and had said that the deceased was providing him with information for the book.
	
	
	Rogerson said that in early 2014 Michael Maguire, a friend of his, had told him that some office furniture was being moved to a storage facility at Rent-a-Space at Padstow. According to Rogerson, he told Maguire that he might be able to sell some of that furniture for him. He said that he went to the Rent-a-Space premises on 2 April 2014 for the purposes of looking at the furniture, and the storage facility. He said that he told McNamara about these items, and that McNamara had expressed some interest in them.
	
	
	Rogerson said that on the afternoon of 18 May 2014, McNamara spoke to him about the deceased, saying that he was trying to arrange a meeting at McDonalds at Padstow, but that the storage unit at Rent-a-Space might be a safer place. According to Rogerson, McNamara phoned him on 19 May to tell him that things were “hotting up”.
	
	
	Rogerson stated that McNamara visited him at his home on 20 May 2014 at about 1.00pm. According to Rogerson, McNamara told him that he was to meet with the deceased at McDonalds at Padstow, but that because the deceased was being “hassled by the Triads” it may be necessary to use storage unit 803 at Rent-a-Space as a default meeting place. According to Rogerson, he acceded to McNamara’s request to follow him to Arab Road, Padstow (where McDonalds was located) to “keep an eye out for suspicious cars with Chinese on board”, and be the “second set of eyes”.
	
	
	Rogerson admitted going to Arab Road, and later going to Rent-a-Space. He said that upon entering storage unit 803, McNamara was already present, and the deceased lay dead on the floor. According to Rogerson, McNamara told him (inter alia) that the deceased had “pulled a gun” on him and that, in an ensuing struggle, the deceased had shot himself twice in the chest.
	
	
	It will be apparent that the accounts of the offenders were diametrically opposed, with each effectively blaming the other. The jury’s verdicts necessarily represent an acceptance of the joint criminal enterprise alleged by the Crown.
	


THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDING

The making of findings of fact


	
	For the purposes of determining sentence, I am required to make findings of fact in relation to the circumstances of the offending. Any findings that I make must be consistent with the jury’s verdicts. In particular, I must accept such facts as are established by those verdicts, and I must not determine any factual issue in a way which is inconsistent with them: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. The Crown bears the onus of satisfying me, beyond reasonable doubt, of any finding of fact against the offender(s). Each offender bears the onus of proving factual matters in mitigation, on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	There are numerous facts which are objectively established by the evidence, and which are not in dispute. However, I have heard lengthy submissions as to a number of other issues, in respect of which I have been urged by one or other of the parties to make particular factual findings. I have identified those issues where they arise on the evidence, and I have set out my findings in relation to them.
	


The deceased


	
	The deceased was a 20 year old university student. Inherent in the Crown case was the fact that at the time of his death, the deceased was engaged in the supply of a substantial quantity of an illicit drug. Evidence was adduced by the Crown from friends and relatives of the deceased, which established that he regularly associated with persons who were similarly engaged in such supply.
	
	
	In the period leading up to his death, the deceased spoke to his family and friends about a person named Glen, and about meeting Glen in relation to a “deal” which he said would be “massive”, and would make him “rich”. These were obvious references to McNamara, and to the proposed supply of a quantity of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	On occasions, the deceased would leave the company of his friends to meet with McNamara, and would deliberately leave his phone behind when he did so. That was clearly a step taken by him to avoid detection. Although there was some evidence given in the trial which pointed to the possibility of McNamara having taught the deceased this technique, I am unable, particularly given the deceased’s prior association with the drug trade and those involved in it, to be satisfied that McNamara in fact did so.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the evidence of the deceased’s obvious involvement in the supply of illicit drugs to the offenders, the written submissions filed by counsel for McNamara included the following (at [13]):
	


“Finally – and this submission should in no way be interpreted as suggesting the deceased deserved to be shot given his involvement in the illegal drug milieu – it is not irrelevant to observe that the deceased was criminally concerned with the supply of illegal drugs for profit. The evidence from his cousin was that the deceased had an expectation of a substantial windfall cash profit from the supply of the methylamphetamine to the offender(s). The deceased must have realised that his involvement with illegal drugs had real potential to end badly for him. The deceased must have realised that dealing in large quantities of illegal drugs valued at $100,000s could, and ultimately did, expose him to deadly violence.”


	
	As I observed in oral argument, I find that submission troubling. Having initially sought to support it, counsel for McNamara ultimately disavowed any reliance upon it. Counsel also stated that he did not intend the submission to “have any legal effect on the sentencing at all” and that it was intended to be a “passing observation”.
	
	
	The submission which was made was entirely irrelevant to any matter which bears upon the determination of an appropriate sentence. Notwithstanding the “disclaimer” as to one interpretation which might be ascribed to it, the submission is capable of being construed in a way which carries a thinly veiled suggestion that the deceased’s involvement in the trafficking of illicit drugs should somehow lead to a conclusion that his life was of less worth. Any such proposition should be firmly rejected. The worth of a victim’s life is not “graded” according to his or her background, and then somehow taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence. As Hunt CJ at CL stated in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 86-87:
	


“The law already recognises, without specific evidence, the value which the community places upon human life, that is why unlawful homicide is regarded as a most serious crime, one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar. It is regarded by all thinking persons as offensive to fundamental concepts of equality and justice for criminal courts to value one life as greater than another”.


	
	Ultimately, counsel expressly conceded that even if it were accepted that the deceased had a realisation of the danger in which he had placed himself by acting as he did, that did not lessen the gravity of the offending of which McNamara had been found guilty. Given that concession, and given the fact that any reliance on the submission was ultimately disavowed, it is difficult to understand why the submission was made at all.
	


McNamara’s introduction to the deceased


	
	In 2012 Chun Lok Lam (“Lok”) and Chun Kit Lam (“Kit”) were each charged with supplying a prohibited drug. In 2014, they each pleaded guilty and were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. Adam Ly, a solicitor, acted for both Lok and Kit. Mr Ly retained Charles Moschoudis, a barrister, to appear for Lok.
	
	
	At the time of being retained to appear for Lok, Mr Moschoudis had known Rogerson for some time. Through that connection, Rogerson had previously introduced Mr Moschoudis to McNamara. Mr Moschoudis had become aware at some point that McNamara carried on business as a private investigator, and he engaged McNamara to assist in the preparation of Lok’s case. For that purpose, various conferences were held at which Mr Moschoudis, Mr Ly, Lok and McNamara were all in attendance. Importantly, the deceased, who was a friend of Lok, also attended some of those conferences in the capacity of an interpreter. It was in those circumstances that he and McNamara first became acquainted.
	
	
	The initial association between McNamara and the deceased was therefore a completely lawful one. However, their subsequent contact between early March 2014 and 20 May 2014, was such that this initial lawful association was quickly transformed into one which was wholly unlawful.
	
	
	McNamara’s association with the deceased from March 2014 to May 2014
	
	
	On the afternoon of 2 March 2014 an exchange of text messages took place between the deceased and McNamara, in the course of which the deceased advised McNamara that he had just returned from Hong Kong. A meeting was arranged to take place between them. I am satisfied that the deceased had travelled to Hong Kong to make arrangements to source the drugs which were to be supplied. McNamara conceded in his evidence before the jury that he was “curious” about what had happened in Hong Kong. I am satisfied that McNamara well knew the purpose of the deceased’s trip to Hong Kong. His desire to meet with the deceased following the latter’s return stemmed from something substantially greater than just idle curiosity.
	
	
	The exchange of text messages between the deceased and McNamara on 2 March 2014 marked the commencement of a 2½ month period in which they not only contacted each other, but in which they met personally on no less than 27 occasions. Contrary to McNamara’s assertions before the jury, I am satisfied that none of that contact, and none of those meetings, were associated in any way with McNamara conducting research with a view to publishing a book on the subject of Asian crime gangs. So much is clear for a number of reasons.
	
	
	Firstly, there was an almost total absence of any contemporaneous notes of what had been discussed at the meetings between McNamara and the deceased. It is inconceivable that if McNamara was meeting with the deceased for the purpose of undertaking research for a proposed book, he would not have made some proper notes of what he was being told.
	
	
	Secondly, and in circumstances where McNamara had available to him (as the result of his work as a private investigator) a number of modes of recording conversations, there was not a single electronic record of anything which had been discussed with the deceased, much less any form of draft manuscript for a proposed book.
	
	
	Thirdly, McNamara’s evidence before the jury was that he had approached a Ms Schultz from New Holland Publishing in the early part of 2014 about the proposed publication. That evidence was completely at odds with a recorded conversation that he had with his former wife on 16 May 2015, in the course of which he said that he had not spoken with Ms Schultz for “a couple of years”. When confronted in cross-examination with that inconsistency, McNamara said that he had lied to his wife about his contact with Ms Schultz in order to protect his family “from having any knowledge of (his) dealings with Fiona Schultz in relation to the Triad books”. However, in circumstances where he admitted that he had no intention of adopting a pseudonym for the purposes of the publication of the book, McNamara’s family would inevitably have come to know about the book when it was ultimately released. The explanation for what he said to his former wife was nothing more than an answer of convenience, to try and explain what was clearly an untruth told to the jury.
	
	
	Fourthly, and quite apart from these factors, the terms of some of the text messages which passed between McNamara and the deceased were completely at odds with the proposition that the discussions which were taking place between them were in the nature of research for a book. For example, on 8 March 2014, in the course of arranging a meeting, the deceased told McNamara that he did not have “good news”. On 17 March 2014 McNamara sent the deceased a message consisting of no more than “??”. When the deceased replied by telling McNamara that things were “still not ok”, McNamara responded by urging the deceased to “be calm”. Other messages which later passed between them were clearly in coded terms. McNamara came to refer to the deceased from time to time as “mum”. The deceased referred to McNamara from time to time as “son”. There were also clearly coded references to things such as “cleaning the house” and “spending some quality family time” in each other’s company, in circumstances where McNamara and the deceased were obviously not related to each other.
	
	
	The pattern of messages which passed between the deceased and McNamara also demonstrated that it was often McNamara who was responsible for initiating contact with the deceased, rather than the other way around. On numerous occasions, McNamara sent the deceased messages requesting, or suggesting, a meeting. On other occasions, he sent messages to the deceased such as “??” or asking “what’s happening”. The nature and extent of those requests and enquiries are wholly inconsistent with undertaking research for a book. They are however, completely consistent with McNamara wanting to be updated about arrangements for the supply of a large quantity of illicit drugs.
	
	
	McNamara’s assertion that he was meeting with the deceased for the purposes of researching a book was nothing more than an elaborate lie, in which he deliberately engaged in an attempt to give an air of legitimacy to what was, in reality, a nefarious association with the deceased. The extent of their overall contact, and the number of times they met personally, serve as an example of the degree of planning in which McNamara engaged in the period leading up to the deceased’s death.
	
	
	An issue arose in the sentence proceedings as to what finding(s) should be made as to Rogerson’s knowledge of the fact and purpose of the contact and meetings which took place between the deceased and McNamara from early March 2014. The Crown submitted that I would be satisfied that Rogerson knew of such matters. The Crown placed particular significance in this regard upon the evidence of telephone contact between McNamara and Rogerson which had occurred at or about the time of some of the contact between McNamara and the deceased.
	
	
	Counsel for Rogerson submitted that none of this evidence established Rogerson’s knowledge of the fact and purpose of meetings which were taking place between McNamara and the deceased, and that any conclusion to the contrary would involve engaging in impermissible speculation. He submitted, in particular, that it was necessary to assess the evidence in the context of the fact that the offenders had been friends for some time, that Rogerson referred clients to McNamara, and that as a result, they were obviously in regular contact with one another for wholly legitimate purposes.
	
	
	Exh. CU before the jury was a schedule setting out the time, date and content of the text messages which passed between McNamara and the deceased between 2 March 2014 and 20 May 2014. Exh. DE was a schedule of the time, date and duration of telephone contact (over a far longer period) between a number of relevant persons, including the two offenders. Taken together, that evidence establishes (inter alia) the following:
	



	
	on 2 March 2014, following the deceased’s return from Hong Kong, a series of text messages passed between he and McNamara, in the course of which they arranged to meet on 4 March 2014. The last of those text messages was sent at 6.11pm on 2 March 2014. At 6.50pm McNamara telephoned Rogerson and they had a conversation lasting almost 12 minutes;
	
	
	on 8 March 2014 at 3.27pm, and in response to two earlier messages from McNamara attempting to arrange a meeting, the deceased responded by telling McNamara that he did not have “good news”. Further text messages passed between them, culminating in McNamara sending a message to the deceased at 4.01pm saying “I’m here”. Clearly, the deceased and McNamara met at about 4.00pm on that day. McNamara telephoned Rogerson and left a voice message at 4.44pm, a time consistent with the meeting with the deceased having concluded;
	
	
	on 17 March 2014 at 4.04pm, McNamara sent the deceased a text message stating “??”. The deceased responded one minute later, telling McNamara that things were “not ok”, prompting McNamara to tell the deceased in a message sent at 5.09pm to “be calm”. At 7.31pm that evening Rogerson called McNamara. McNamara called back at 7.42pm and they spoke for more than three minutes;
	
	
	on 18 March 2014 at 5.59pm, McNamara again sent the deceased a text message stating “??”. At 6.04pm McNamara called Rogerson and they spoke for 50 seconds. At 6.05pm the deceased replied by again telling McNamara that things were “still not ok”. At 6.06pm Rogerson called McNamara, and they spoke for more than 8 minutes;
	
	
	on 3 April 2014 commencing at 12.26pm, a series of text messages passed between McNamara and the deceased which culminated in a meeting being arranged to take place between 3.45pm and 4.00pm that afternoon. Rogerson telephoned McNamara at 1.00pm. At 3.43pm the deceased sent a message to McNamara saying that he was “here”. McNamara responded at 3.47pm, saying that he would be “5 min”. Photographs taken from CCTV footage taken at the Meridien Hotel show the deceased arriving at 3.50pm, and McNamara at 4.02pm. They are then seen to depart separately, the deceased at 4.30pm and McNamara at 4.32pm. The meeting having finished, McNamara called Rogerson at 4.33pm (i.e., 1 minute after leaving the hotel) and left a message for him. He called him again 2 minutes later at 4.35pm and left another message. He called him again 4 minutes later at 4.39pm, at which time they spoke for more than 5 minutes;
	
	
	on 15 May 2014, only 5 days before the deceased’s murder, an exchange of messages took place between McNamara and the deceased arranging a meeting for 3 pm on that day. At 2.22pm, Rogerson called McNamara. They spoke for 14 minutes and 29 seconds, the call concluding at 2.36pm. At 2.37pm, McNamara communicated his arrival to the deceased by sending him a message saying “here”. The overwhelming inference is that McNamara and Rogerson spoke for a lengthy period immediately before the meeting between McNamara and the deceased. Following that meeting, Rogerson called McNamara at 7.11pm and again at 10.21pm;
	
	
	on 17 May 2014 a series of text messages passed between the deceased and McNamara arranging a meeting for the following day, 18 May 2014. On that day at 12.30pm, McNamara sent a message to the deceased that he was “parking” and would be 5 min”. At 1.21pm McNamara called Rogerson. He called him again at 1.30pm. Rogerson called McNamara at 5.55pm and they spoke for more than 2 minutes; and
	
	
	on 19 May 2014, McNamara called Rogerson at 2.34pm and they spoke for more than 3 minutes. McNamara and the deceased later arranged to meet at the Meridien Hotel at 7.45pm. Photographs taken from CCTV footage confirm that they did so. McNamara left the hotel at 8.22pm and the deceased at 8.23pm.
	



	
	As with the position at trial, the Crown case for the purpose of finding facts on sentence is a circumstantial one. However, whether it be for the purposes of determining guilt, or for the purposes of making factual findings on sentence, the approach to the assessment of a circumstantial case must, in my view, be the same: any determination must be made having regard to the whole of the evidence, not just isolated parts of it.
	
	
	The juxtaposition of contact between McNamara and the deceased on the one hand, and between McNamara and Rogerson on the other, is telling in itself. It becomes even more so when it is considered as part of the overall circumstantial case brought by the Crown.
	
	
	The contact between the offenders, in close proximity to contact between McNamara and the deceased, was not co-incidental. On the whole of the evidence, including the various matters to which I will come, I am satisfied that Rogerson knew of the fact and purpose of McNamara’s meetings with the deceased, on and from the early part of March 2014.
	


Rent-a-Space storage unit 803


	
	In 2014, Rent-a-Space Storage (“Rent-a-Space”) had premises throughout Sydney, including a facility located at Davies Road, Padstow. The business of Rent-a-Space included the leasing of storage space to customers for a monthly fee. In 2014, the Rent-a-Space facility at Padstow was accessible by customers between the hours of 6.00am and 9.00pm, seven days per week.
	
	
	When a customer wished to lease storage space from Rent-a-Space at Padstow, he or she entered into a written agreement. Upon the execution of such agreement, the customer was given a numerical code which, when correctly entered, would allow access through a security gate at the front of the premises, and into the area in which the storage units were located. Upon entering, the alarm for the particular storage unit would be disabled. The alarm would be reactivated upon the customer’s exit from the premises.
	
	
	Upon leasing a storage unit, a customer was given the option of securing the unit with his or her own padlock, or alternatively purchasing a padlock from Rent-a-Space for that purpose. The padlocks sold by Rent-a-Space each came with three keys.
	
	
	On 21 February 2014 Michael Maguire (“Maguire”), who was a friend of Rogerson, entered into an agreement with Rent-a-Space to lease storage units 803 and 804 at the Padstow facility. Although there were separate entry doors, there was no internal dividing wall between the two storage units and I will refer to them collectively as “storage unit 803”.
	
	
	Maguire provided two statements to the police for the purposes of their investigation. He had passed away by the time of the commencement of the trial but with the consent of all parties, his statements were admitted into evidence.
	
	
	In the first of his statements, Maguire explained that he had leased storage unit 803 following the expiration of the lease of premises from which he had previously conducted a business. He explained that he required space in which to store items of furniture which had previously been in use at his business premises. In the second of his two statements, Maguire said that a quantity of his office furniture had been moved into storage unit 803 on 24 February 2014.
	
	
	Maguire said that approximately two weeks after renting storage unit 803, i.e. in the early part of March 2014, he met Rogerson at the Grandviews Bowling Club where they spoke about the storage of Maguire’s furniture. He said he offered Rogerson the opportunity to go to storage unit 803 and look at the furniture in the event that he wanted a chair and printer for his home office. According to Maguire, Rogerson said he was “interested in having a look”.
	
	
	Three days later Maguire, Rogerson and a number of other persons met at the Grandviews Bowling Club. Maguire was in possession of the padlock keys for unit 803 which were inside a small white envelope, on the outside of which was written the security code for the front gate of Rent-a-Space. Maguire handed Rogerson the keys on that occasion. He said he could not recall how many keys were on the key ring but that he assumed that there were “about 6 or 8”. He said that a couple of days later he saw Rogerson again, at which time Rogerson returned a number of keys to him, saying that “he didn’t take anything as the office chair was unsuitable and he did not want the printer.” From that point, Maguire retained possession of the keys which had been returned to him by Rogerson.
	
	
	Significantly, Maguire told the police that at the time of leasing storage unit 803 he had purchased two padlocks from Rent-a-Space. As I have previously noted, each padlock sold by Rent-a-Space came with three keys. It follows that Maguire originally had a total of six keys. On 26 May 2014 police visited Maguire, at which time he handed over the keys to storage unit 803 which were then in his possession. A total of five keys, not six, were handed over to police.
	
	
	I am satisfied that at the time of leasing storage unit 803, Maguire purchased two padlocks, for each of which he was given three keys, making a total of six. I am satisfied that he handed those six keys to Rogerson in or about early March 2014 but that Rogerson retained one of them, and handed back only five.
	
	
	Rogerson had no legitimate reason to retain a key to storage unit 803. It contained Mr Maguire’s office furniture, in respect of which Rogerson had told Maguire he had no interest. Rogerson did not tell Maguire that he had retained a key to storage unit 803 because he did not want Maguire to know that this was the case. Importantly, on the evidence of Maguire, all of these events occurred in about early March 2014. That coincided with the approximate time at which McNamara commenced meeting with the deceased. Rogerson’s retention of a key to storage unit 803 constituted an important part of the planning in which he and McNamara engaged.
	
	
	Visits to storage unit 803 by McNamara and Rogerson on 2 and 4 April 2014
	
	
	At approximately 2.07pm on 2 April 2014, Rogerson’s vehicle drove into the front area of Rent-a-Space.
	
	
	On 4 April 2014 McNamara’s vehicle, a blue Ford, was seen to enter the front of the Rent-a-Space premises and drive towards the front gate. He was followed by Rogerson driving his vehicle. Although the CCTV footage does not extend to depicting which offender gained access through the security gate there is a strong inference, from the respective positions of their vehicles when they entered the facility, that it was McNamara who entered first, and that he had the digital access code at the time.
	
	
	The purchase of vehicle BV67PX
	
	
	Paul Wheeler (“Wheeler”) was the manager of a business known as “Outback Used Cars” which was located at Lethbridge Park. The business sold second hand motor vehicles, principally by advertising them on the internet. In about April 2014, Wheeler advertised a white Falcon station wagon Reg. No. BV67PX (“the white Falcon”). According to Wheeler, a person who was “possibly Aboriginal” and who identified himself as “Marvin”, attended his premises on 27 April 2014 and expressed an interest in purchasing the white Falcon.
	
	
	Wheeler’s records state that the white Falcon was sold to a person named “Marvin James Turnbull”, whose address was in Mt Druitt. Wheeler maintained that he sighted a copy of a driver’s licence in that name, but said he did not take a copy of it. Police investigations revealed no trace of a Marvin James Turnbull. No person by that name lived at the nominated Mt Druitt address.
	
	
	A receipt for the purported sale of the white Falcon for a sum of $2,000.00 to Marvin James Turnbull which was issued by Wheeler was ultimately found in McNamara’s premises. However, it bore Rogerson’s fingerprint on the back of it. The evidence before the jury established that the purchase price of $2,000.00 for the white Falcon was provided from monies withdrawn from a bank account operated by McNamara.
	
	
	According to Wheeler he had, over a period of time, become acquainted through the conduct of his business with a person named Karl Bonnette (“Bonnette”). Bonnette is a friend of Rogerson. On 26 June 2014 Bonnette was spoken to by police about the purchase of the white Falcon from Wheeler. He denied knowing anything about it. Significantly, when the vehicle was seized by the police, a copy of a newspaper known as the “Hawkesbury Gazette” was found in it. Bonnette agreed that this was his local newspaper, but continued to deny having anything to do with the purchase of the white Falcon. In a recorded conversation on 27 June 2014, the day after police had spoken to Bonnette, Rogerson’s wife informed Rogerson that Bonnette had made arrangements to see him (Rogerson) in custody on 28 June 2014, i.e. the following day.
	
	
	The evidence establishes the following relevant telephone contact between 24 April 2014 and 27 April 2014:
	


24 April 2014

8:57:20   Bonnette called Wheeler   

9:10:50   McNamara called Rogerson

10:49:38   Wheeler called Bonnette

11:35:51   Wheeler called Bonnette

11:52:14   Rogerson called McNamara

11:54:16    Bonnette called Rogerson

11:56:22   McNamara called Rogerson

11:56:27   Rogerson called Bonnette

11:56:58   McNamara called Rogerson

14:43:50   Rogerson called McNamara

17:58:54   Bonnette called Wheeler

25 April 2014

12:51:25   Wheeler called Bonnette

13:15:03   Bonnette called Rogerson

13:40:37   Rogerson called Bonnette

13:46:46   Bonnette called Wheeler

27 April 2014

12:39:56   Bonnette called Wheeler

14:41:06   Wheeler called Bonnette

14:41:46   Bonnette called Wheeler

14:59:07   Wheeler called Bonnette


	
	Both Wheeler and Bonnette were taken to this evidence. Wheeler was prepared to concede that it was “possible” that he had spoken to Bonnette about the white Falcon. Bonnette continued to deny having anything to do with the vehicle at all.
	
	
	As I have noted, Rogerson’s fingerprint was found on the receipt for the sale of the white Falcon issued by Wheeler. Rogerson’s explanation for the presence of his fingerprint on that document was that whilst travelling in the white Falcon to Kennards Hire on the afternoon of 20 May 2014 (an event to which I will come) it occurred to him, upon hearing a “whine from the diff”, that the white Falcon may have been previously used as a taxi. Apparently wishing to satisfy his curiosity, Rogerson said that he opened the centre console of the vehicle looking for evidence of wiring which might have been consistent with such previous use. He asserted that whilst in the course of doing so he came into contact with a number of documents, one of which must have been the receipt.
	
	
	Wheeler and Bonnette were largely, if not completely, untruthful in their respective accounts of the roles that they played in respect of what I am satisfied was the acquisition of the white Falcon by McNamara and Rogerson. The proposition that an indigenous looking, but otherwise unidentified, man by the name of “Marvin” suddenly appeared at Wheeler’s premises enquiring about the purchase of the white Falcon was entirely fanciful. “Marvin James Turnbull” was a complete fiction, and the “receipt” for the sale which Wheeler created was a complete forgery.
	
	
	Bonnette’s repeated denial of having played a role in the acquisition of the white Falcon was equally fanciful. It flew in the face of the evidence of the telephone contact which I have previously set out. Moreover, the presence of Bonnette’s local newspaper in the vehicle when it was seized by police was not a coincidence. It is also telling that within a very short time of being spoken to by the police about the white Falcon, Bonnette was due to see Rogerson in custody. The overwhelming inference is that he wanted to see Rogerson to speak with him about the white Falcon.
	
	
	However what is even more far-fetched is Rogerson’s explanation for the presence of his fingerprint on the receipt. Accepting that explanation for the purposes of testing its veracity, it is significant that the deceased was shot and killed only a short time before Rogerson said he handled the receipt. On Rogerson’s own admission he had willingly assisted McNamara to drag the deceased’s body out of storage unit 803 at Rent-a-Space and place it in the rear of the white Falcon, before helping to unload it in the basement car park of McNamara’s premises. He then travelled to Kennards Hire with McNamara for the purposes of hiring a chain block to lift the deceased’s body into McNamara’s boat. It was during that trip to Kennards that he maintains that his fingerprint was inadvertently placed on the receipt.
	
	
	When giving evidence before the jury, Rogerson described the period leading up to the trip to Kennards as a “very stressful time”. The suggestion that in all of those circumstances, Rogerson became curious as to whether the white Falcon had once been used as a taxi, and that he then set about satisfying his curiosity by looking though the console, in the course of which he just happened to inadvertently touch the receipt, is frankly absurd. Rogerson’s fingerprint was on the receipt because along with McNamara, he was instrumental in the acquisition, through Wheeler and Bonnette, of the white Falcon. The fact of such acquisition is supported by what can only be described as a flurry of telephone contact on 24, 25 and 27 April 2014.
	
	
	The acquisition of the white Falcon represented an important step in the planning in which the offenders engaged. A vehicle which, in effect, was traceable to nobody was an indispensable instrument for two persons who were engaged in carrying out an agreement to kill a person, and steal drugs from him. Significantly, the white Falcon was a station wagon. It was therefore completely suitable for the purpose of conveying the body of a deceased person from one place to another.
	


The events of 19 May 2014


	
	In May 2014 McNamara was the owner of a 4.5 metre boat. On or about 9 April 2014 he had entered into an agreement with Hunter Self-Storage (“HSS”) to allow him to store the boat at the HSS premises at Caringbah. The monthly storage fee was $200.00. Although the initial agreement applied to the period from 9 April 2014 to 30 April 2014, the evidence was that the agreement was automatically renewed at the end of each month.
	
	
	Shortly after 10.00am on 19 May 2014, McNamara removed the boat from storage, towing it with his blue Falcon back to his premises at Cronulla. He proceeded directly into the underground car park of the premises, where the boat remained until the morning of 21 May 2014, when it was removed for the purposes of disposing of the deceased’s body at sea, before being returned to storage at HSS.
	
	
	Rogerson attended storage unit 803 at about 3.12pm on 19 May 2014, and left at about 3.30pm. The CCTV footage from Rent-a-Space shows that having entered storage unit 803, Rogerson removed two office chairs and placed them into the rear of his vehicle before driving away. Rogerson told the jury that when he had gone to the storage unit in early April, he had observed some “nice leather” chairs which he thought he could use in his home office. He said that his purpose in attending storage unit 803 on 19 May was (inter alia) “to get a couple of chairs to replace the ones in (his) office”. However prior to taking the chairs from the storage unit, Rogerson had taken no measurements, either of the area within his home in which he was proposing to place the chairs, or of the chairs themselves, so as to ensure that they would fit. Moreover, he had previously told Maguire that when he had initially looked at the furniture he did not take anything because (inter alia) “the office chair was unsuitable”.
	
	
	I do not accept Rogerson’s explanation for his visit to storage unit 803 on 19 May, particularly in circumstances where on the morning of 22 May 2014 he returned the two chairs that he had taken. I am satisfied in all of the circumstances that Rogerson’s attendance at the storage unit on 19 May had nothing to do with obtaining items of furniture for his home office, but everything to do with making more space in storage unit 803 for what was to occur on the following day.
	
	
	The deceased’s vehicle was seen to enter the drive way of Rent-a-Space at about 4.22pm on 19 May, before making a u-turn and leaving. Following an exchange of text messages, McNamara and the deceased met with each other at the Meridian Hotel at about 8.00pm that evening. The meeting lasted for approximately 20 minutes. I am satisfied that it was held for the purposes of confirming the supply of the methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The events of the morning and early afternoon of 20 May 2014
	
	
	At about 12.34am on 20 May 2014, following the meeting which had taken place on the previous evening, the deceased sent a message to McNamara in the following terms:
	
	
	“Hey thanks for the drink today, much appreciated, maybe we can meet up again in our free time and hang out again”.
	
	
	McNamara responded at 6.42am by saying:
	
	
	“No worries”.
	
	
	At about 11.35am that same morning, CCTV footage captured McNamara in Cronulla Mall, walking towards a public pay phone. That pay phone was used at 11.37am to contact the deceased’s phone. I am satisfied that McNamara made that call to the deceased, that he did so for the purposes of confirming the supply of drugs which was to take place later that day, and that he did so from a public pay phone in an effort to ensure that the call could not be traced to him.
	
	
	One minute later, at 11.38am, the deceased sent a text message to McNamara in the following terms:
	
	
	“Hey it was great having a drink last night, but I’m not in the mood to study today. I was wondering if you wanted to grab lunch this afternoon.”
	
	
	McNamara replied at 11.53am:
	
	
	“No. I’m sick. Food poisoning. Can’t spend too much time away from the bathroom. I’ll call you in a couple of days”.
	
	
	The deceased replied at 11.56am:
	
	
	“Oh wow that sucks, I guess since I have nothing better to do ill just catch up on my studies and spend some time with the mrs. I hope you get well soon, we can have another drink when I finish my exams”.
	
	
	Those three messages were a complete ruse. McNamara was not ill at all, as evidenced not only by his demeanour on the CCTV footage but also by what occurred later that day. In sending a message to the deceased saying that he was ill, McNamara was engaging in a blatant attempt to create the false impression that he was not intending to meet with the deceased at any time on that day.
	
	
	At 12.04pm McNamara drove the white Falcon into the basement car park of his premises at Cronulla. At 12.11pm, 18 minutes after telling the deceased that he was too ill to see him and could not leave the bathroom, McNamara drove the white Falcon out of the car park. Amongst the items in his possession at that time was a silver surfboard cover. For reasons to which I will come, that item assumes considerable significance.
	
	
	At about 1.16pm McNamara and Rogerson arrived together at Rent-a-Space. Having entered the complex, they went to storage unit 803. McNamara opened the lock on the storage unit and both he and Rogerson went inside. McNamara was then seen to come outside and repeatedly move the shutter door to storage unit 803 up and down. Rogerson remained inside when he did so. Clearly, McNamara was ensuring that the shutter door would properly open and close, a clear indication that privacy was required. The offenders remained inside the storage unit for some minutes before coming out. McNamara secured the door of the shutter before leaving. I am satisfied that their visit to the storage unit on that occasion was to ensure that all was in readiness for what was about to follow.
	


The events at Arab Road, Padstow on the afternoon of 20 May 2014


	
	It was approximately 1.30pm when the offenders left Rent-a-Space. A short time later, the white Falcon was seen to drive along Davies Road, Padstow towards Arab Road, closely followed by Rogerson’s vehicle. What subsequently took place in Arab Road is demonstrative of the level of organisation, planning and co-ordination in which the offenders engaged.
	
	
	At about 1.33pm McNamara drove the white Falcon along Arab Road before parking (facing Davies Road) outside a business known as Crow Martial Arts. Rogerson’s vehicle entered Arab Road about 1 minute later. Before reaching the position at which McNamara had parked the white Falcon, Rogerson made a u-turn and parked his vehicle, facing away from Davies Road, in an available kerb side space outside a business known as Mick’s Meats. Having done so, he remained in his car.
	
	
	At about 1.38pm the deceased’s vehicle, a white Nissan, entered Arab Road from Davies Road. McNamara and Rogerson were still in their respective vehicles, in the positions in which they had previously parked them. The deceased’s vehicle drove along Arab Road, straight past Rogerson. Within a short time of the deceased’s vehicle driving past, Rogerson moved his vehicle from its kerbside parking space, and drove immediately left into the driveway of Mick’s Meats where there was a car park. He then manoeuvred his vehicle so that it remained within that car park, facing towards Davies Road, directly towards the position of the white Falcon. The deceased’s vehicle then travelled back down Arab Road towards Davies Road, before making a u-turn and parking in the space left vacant by Rogerson just a short time before. Rogerson’s vehicle remained in the Mick’s Meats car park, facing in the direction of the deceased’s vehicle.
	
	
	Having viewed the CCTV footage of these events, I am satisfied that Rogerson could not have helped but see the deceased’s vehicle as it drove immediately past him when he was parked in Arab Road. He gave evidence that the colour, make and model of the deceased’s vehicle had been described to him by McNamara. It is clear that having seen the deceased’s vehicle, Rogerson deliberately moved his own vehicle into the car park of Mick’s Meats, so as to allow the deceased to park in Arab Road.
	
	
	The deceased got out of his car carrying an item in his hand, and immediately made his way along Arab Road, towards the white Falcon. Rogerson remained in the car park of Mick’s Meats, facing in the same direction as that in which the deceased was walking. That position gave Rogerson a direct line of sight to the path followed by the deceased. When the deceased reached the white Falcon he entered the rear passenger side, the door having been left ajar by McNamara to facilitate his entry. The white Falcon, driven by McNamara, then left Arab Road and proceeded to Rent-a-Space.
	
	
	According to Rogerson, his presence in Arab Road was at McNamara’s request, so that he (Rogerson) could act as a “second set of eyes” and “keep a lookout”. Rogerson said that McNamara had asked him to “go up there and keep an eye out for suspicious cars … with Chinese on board”. Remarkably however, according to Rogerson, no discussion ever took place with McNamara about what he was to actually do if such observations were made. Moreover, and bearing in mind his asserted purpose for his presence in Arab Road, Rogerson did not even wait for the deceased to reach the white Falcon before he drove away. Had Rogerson really been present in that vicinity for the purpose of keeping a lookout, be it for suspicious people or suspicious activities as they pertained to the deceased, he surely would have waited until the deceased had safely reached the security of the white Falcon before leaving.
	
	
	By the time Rogerson commenced to turn into Arab Road from the Mick’s Meats car park and drive away, two other men had exited from the deceased’s vehicle and had remained standing next to it. It is clear that once he was satisfied that the deceased was on his way to the white Falcon, Rogerson drove away from Arab Road and made his way to Rent-a-Space. I am satisfied that part of the reason that Rogerson left Arab Road when he did was to ensure, as far as he could, that his presence was not detected by the two other persons who had exited the deceased’s vehicle.
	
	
	McNamara conveyed the deceased in the white Falcon from Arab Road to Rent-a-Space, arriving at about 1.42pm. He entered the access code at the front gate and drove the white Falcon to a position outside the entrance to storage unit 803. He then got out of the driver’s side of the white Falcon, deliberately shielded the deceased, and ushered him into the storage unit.
	
	
	At this time, McNamara was dressed in a grey “hoodie” and long dark tracksuit pants. He was also wearing sunglasses as well as a cap, over which the top part of the hoodie was stretched. McNamara admitted that he was wearing this clothing when he left Cronulla at about 12.11pm. He said that he had dressed in that way in an attempt to conceal his identity, because of a fear of the immediate presence of members of Asian crime gangs.
	
	
	McNamara’s mode of dress when leaving Cronulla at 12.11pm was somewhat different to what it had been a little more than 30 minutes earlier. Between 11.29am and 11.37am, McNamara was seen outside his premises, and then walking openly in Cronulla Mall, wearing sunglasses, shorts (as opposed to long tracksuit pants), a lighter coloured “hoodie” (which was not pulled up over his head) and no cap.
	
	
	There was no evidence of any event which occurred between the time McNamara was in Cronulla Mall, and the time he left his apartment, which might explain his having developed a sudden fear of the immediate presence of members Asian crime gangs, and which was of such concern that it caused him to change his clothes. His manner of dress at Rent-a-Space at 1.42pm can also be usefully contrasted with his appearance at Kennards Hire a few hours later, at which time he wore a t-shirt, shorts (or perhaps rolled-up long pants), no hoodie, no cap, and no sunglasses.
	
	
	I am satisfied that McNamara was dressed as he was at Rent-a-Space on the afternoon of 20 May 2014 to conceal his identity. However that was not because he was in fear of anyone. It was because he was engaged in serious criminal activity and was taking steps to avoid detection.
	
	
	The deceased’s shooting
	
	
	McNamara and the deceased entered storage unit 803 at approximately 1.46pm. Rogerson entered 3 minutes and 19 seconds later. I am satisfied that the deceased was shot and killed, whilst in storage unit 803, at some time between about 1.46pm and about 2.18pm. Two particular factual issues as to what occurred in that period arise on the evidence.
	
	
	The first is whether I can be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, which of the offenders shot the deceased. The Crown submitted that although there was some evidence which might point to Rogerson being responsible, the evidence was not sufficient to establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that this was the case. The Crown further submitted that even if such a finding could be reached, it would have little or no effect on my assessment of the respective liability of each offender, bearing in mind that on the Crown case as accepted by the jury, the deceased’s killing was pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	Counsel for McNamara submitted that the expert evidence adduced at trial established a “firearm association” with Rogerson, and that this sustained an inference that it was Rogerson who had shot the deceased, within the confines of storage unit 803, with a .25 calibre hand gun.
	
	
	Counsel for Rogerson essentially took the same position as that of the Crown, and submitted that the evidence was not sufficient to establish that Rogerson fired the fatal shots. He submitted, in particular, that although gunshot residue had been found on some of the items of clothing that Rogerson was wearing on 20 May, the expert evidence made it clear that there were a number of competing explanations for the presence of that residue, all of which were of equal weight.
	
	
	Rogerson was seen at storage unit 803 on 20 May 2014 on two separate occasions. On each occasion he was wearing (inter alia) a multi coloured cap and a pair of black tracksuit pants. Evidence was given in the trial by Dr Stephanie Hales, a Forensic Chemist, that:
	



	
	one particle characteristic of gunshot residue containing lead, antimony and barium, and two indicative particles containing lead and antimony, were detected on the hat; and
	
	
	one particle characteristic of gunshot residue containing lead, antimony and barium was detected on the pants, along with two indicative particles containing lead and antimony on the pockets.
	



	
	CCTV footage taken on the following day, 21 May 2014, showed Rogerson wearing a coloured polo shirt. That shirt was also tested for gunshot residue. Dr Hales reported that two particles characteristic of gunshot residue containing lead, antimony and barium, and one indicative particle containing lead and antimony, were detected on it.
	
	
	Ultimately, Dr Hales concluded that the presence of these various particles on Rogerson’s clothing supported “the proposition of a firearm association”. She explained that the particles could have been deposited and retained, and could thus be accounted for, by one or all of the following:
	



	
	Rogerson having fired a gun; and/or
	
	
	Rogerson being in close proximity to a gun at the time that it was fired; and/or
	
	
	Rogerson having come into contact with an object or surface that was contaminated with gunshot residue.
	



	
	Importantly, in the course of giving evidence, Dr Hales expressly conceded that she was not in a position to say which of those three scenarios had resulted in particles being deposited. She also said that no one scenario was more likely than the other.
	
	
	A further area of evidence which bears upon this issue is that of McNamara’s daughter, Jessica. I have considered this evidence in more detail when addressing McNamara’s assertion of duress. Ms McNamara gave evidence that on the afternoon of 20 May 2014, within the apartment at Cronulla in which she lived with her father and sister, she observed a “lump” in the pocket of Rogerson’s pants which he was “tapping” at a time when referring to McNamara’s “lovely girls”. For reasons to which I will come, I found that aspect of Ms McNamara’s evidence in the trial to be unreliable, as I did McNamara’s evidence as to the same issue.
	
	
	Items of McNamara’s clothing which were tested did not reveal the presence of any gunshot residue. However, the weight of that evidence must be assessed having regard to the fact that the clothing that McNamara was seen wearing on 20 May 2014 was not recovered, and was seemingly disposed of.
	
	
	It is also relevant that in the period leading up to the deceased’s death, McNamara had undertaken searches on the internet of (inter alia) the terms “Baby Browning 0.25”, “Baby Browning 0.25 single action” and “Baby Browning 0.25 technical”. Expert evidence was given before the jury that a 0.25 calibre FN Baby Browning self-loading pistol was capable of having fired the two bullets which killed the deceased. However the evidence was that a great many other firearms had a similar capability. McNamara’s explanation was that he was engaged in an investigation concerning guns, which rendered it necessary for him to undertake those searches.
	
	
	The respective accounts of each offender about what occurred in storage unit 803 were diametrically opposed. Given all that had occurred up to that point, and given what followed, I am satisfied that neither account was truthful. The deceased was executed in cold blood, just as the offenders had planned. Clearly, one of them shot the deceased. There is an obvious suspicion, arising from the evidence of the presence of gunshot residue on his clothing, that it was Rogerson who did so. However in light of Dr Hales’ evidence, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was the case. Whilst I am satisfied that the deceased was shot by one of the offenders whilst in storage unit 803, I am unable to determine which offender was responsible.
	
	
	The second issue which arises from the circumstances in which the deceased was killed concerns the time at which the joint criminal enterprise which the jury found was established, was formed.
	
	
	Counsel for McNamara submitted that it would be consistent with the verdicts of the jury to conclude that any agreement between the two offenders to kill the deceased “only crystallised in response to the unanticipated violent circumstances that occurred inside storage unit 803”. Counsel submitted that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offenders planned, from a point in time well before 20 May 2014, that in order to gain possession of the methylamphetamine, they would have to murder the deceased and dispose of his body, so as to ensure that he was never found. Counsel submitted that there was never any plan between the offenders to murder the deceased. Rather, it was submitted, the plan was to “rip” the drugs from the deceased, and that the deceased’s killing “occurred as the result of an altercation between Rogerson and the deceased over possession of the methylamphetamine”.
	
	
	Counsel for Rogerson submitted that it would be consistent with the verdicts of the jury to conclude that Rogerson became a party to a joint criminal enterprise with McNamara for the supply of the drug at a point in time much closer to 20 May 2014, and that before that time “McNamara and the deceased were engaged in a separate joint criminal enterprise for the supply of the drug which commenced between them in about January or February 2014”. Counsel for Rogerson submitted that the proposition advanced on behalf of McNamara that the joint criminal enterprise could have been formed as a result of the events in storage unit 803 had “some merit”, although he made it clear that Rogerson did not accept McNamara’s account of events as to what had occurred. Counsel submitted that there was “scope” for a finding that McNamara “solely formed an intention to cause grievous bodily harm to, or to kill the deceased, separate from Rogerson and prior to the formation of any joint criminal enterprise with Rogerson to kill the deceased”.
	
	
	In determining this issue, it is necessary to reiterate that it was the Crown’s case from start to finish that the joint criminal enterprise in which the offenders engaged had, as its object, the killing of the deceased and the stealing of a quantity of drugs for profit. Evidently, that case was accepted by the jury. Moreover, for the reasons I have already expressed, I am satisfied that Rogerson was well aware of the fact of, and the reasons for, the meetings between McNamara and the deceased as early as about March 2014. This was not, on any view of it, a case where there were separate criminal enterprises which somehow “merged”, as was submitted by counsel for Rogerson.
	
	
	The proposition that it is open to me to find that any joint criminal enterprise to kill the deceased was formed in storage unit 803, and only a short time before the deceased was killed, has two particular difficulties. Firstly, the acceptance of such a proposition depends, to a greater or lesser extent, upon accepting parts of one or other of the accounts given by each offender. Having observed each offender giving evidence over a lengthy period of time, I formed the view that the evidence of each of them was unreliable in a number of respects, some of which I have already identified. Each of them had a propensity, particularly when being cross-examined, to answer questions in a way which was wholly or partly non-responsive, and in terms which appeared to be deliberately formulated to suit their own purposes.
	
	
	Secondly, the proposition that the joint criminal enterprise to kill the deceased was formed only minutes before the fatal shots were fired is completely at odds with everything that had occurred up until that time, as well as everything that occurred subsequently. Whilst the evidence does not enable me to be precise as to the time of the formation of the joint criminal enterprise, I am satisfied that it was well before 20 May 2014, encompassing as it did the various preparatory steps to which I have referred, commencing with McNamara’s meetings with the deceased in March 2014. For reasons to which I will come, the events which took place after the deceased’s murder only serve to confirm that the joint criminal enterprise was formed well in advance of 20 May.
	
	
	The transfer of the deceased’s body to Cronulla 
	
	
	I have previously observed that when he left his premises at Cronulla in the white Falcon at 12.11pm on 20 May, McNamara was in possession of a silver surfboard cover. CCTV footage taken from Rent-a-Space shows McNamara retrieving that item from the white Falcon and taking it into storage unit 803 at approximately 2.09pm on 20 May. I am satisfied that following his death, the deceased’s body was placed in that surfboard cover inside storage unit 803 before being dragged out by the two offenders at about 2.18pm and placed in the rear of the white Falcon.
	
	
	McNamara told the jury that he had come into possession of the white Falcon on about 14 May 2014. That was untrue. Evidence before the jury showed the vehicle parked in Prince Street, Cronulla as early as 5 May 2014. Prince Street is between 200 and 300 metres from McNamara’s premises. I am satisfied that the white Falcon was in McNamara’s possession long before 14 May 2014.
	
	
	McNamara also asserted that Rogerson had told him that he did not want to leave the white Falcon in Padstow. McNamara said that Rogerson had asked him if he could leave the vehicle at Cronulla. McNamara also said that he had asked Rogerson if he could use the white Falcon for the purposes of taking rubbish to the tip, and that Rogerson had agreed that he could do so.
	
	
	Initially, it was McNamara’s clear and unequivocal evidence that he had used the white Falcon to take items to the tip in the period leading up to 20 May 2014. He told the jury that he had done so because he did not wish to run the risk of damaging his blue Ford. He stated that there were various streets in and around Cronulla which were not subject to timed parking, and in which he had left the white Falcon when it was not otherwise being used. He nominated Prince Street (where the vehicle was photographed on 5 May) as one such area. In telling the jury that he had used the white Falcon to go to the tip, McNamara was quite specific, going so far as to explain to the jury the steps he took to park the vehicle when he returned.
	
	
	It is apparent that when this evidence was given by McNamara in chief, the Crown undertook enquiries to ascertain whether the white Falcon had ever entered any rubbish tip located in the general vicinity of McNamara’s home. Police obtained evidence which established that it had not. That evidence subsequently became part of the Crown case in reply. Importantly however, it would appear that McNamara became aware of the existence of that evidence at a time when he himself was still giving evidence. Subsequently, his position as to this issue changed markedly. He said that his previous evidence was a “mistake”, and that he had not in fact used the white Falcon to take rubbish to the tip at all.
	
	
	I am satisfied that McNamara’s evidence that he had come into possession of the white Falcon for the purposes of taking rubbish to the tip, along with his evidence that he had in fact used the vehicle for that purpose, were deliberate untruths, told in an attempt to give an innocent explanation to the fact of his possession of that vehicle. The clear terms in which he had initially given his evidence were completely at odds with the proposition that he had somehow made a mistake.
	
	
	According to McNamara, when he left his premises on 20 May 2014 in the white Falcon he was intending at some stage to go to the tip to dispose of rubbish. The rubbish consisted of two boxes and the silver surfboard cover, all of which, according to McNamara, was apparently able to be placed in the front passenger area of the vehicle. It follows that a station wagon was simply not necessary to carry out McNamara’s stated intention of going to the tip on 20 May.
	
	
	I am satisfied that this part of McNamara’s account was also untrue. He did not, at any stage, intend to go to a tip on 20 May 2014. Specifically, he did not intend to dispose of the silver surfboard cover at a tip. If disposing of the surfboard cover was his true intention, that could easily have been undertaken by tearing it up and disposing of it at his home. I am satisfied that McNamara took the surfboard cover to Rent-a-Space on 20 May for the specific purpose of having something readily available, into which the deceased’s body could be placed after he had been killed. The fact that he chose the white Falcon, a station wagon, to drive to Rent-a-Space that day was also no coincidence. It was planned.
	
	
	Once the deceased’s body had been removed from storage unit 803 and placed in the rear of the white Falcon, McNamara left Rent-a-Space at approximately 2.24pm. Rogerson left at about the same time, driving his own vehicle. The white Falcon arrived at McNamara’s premises at about 3.03pm with the deceased’s body in the back. On arrival, McNamara drove directly into the underground car park.
	
	
	The choice of the underground car park as the location in which to place McNamara’s boat, and later unload the body of the deceased from the white Falcon, was also an important part of the planning in which the offenders had engaged. The car park provided a covert location, at which there were no CCTV cameras, and where the deceased’s body could be dealt with, as it were, in private. At 3.12pm, McNamara was photographed in the lift of the premises, in possession of a length (or lengths) of rope. At some point, a blue tarpaulin and ropes were used to wrap the deceased’s body, which had remained in the surfboard cover. I am satisfied that both offenders participated in that process in the car park. At least some of the rope used to wrap the deceased’s body came from Rogerson’s vehicle.
	
	
	As I have previously observed, McNamara had removed his boat from storage and placed it in the car park on the previous day. Whilst it is not clear precisely when, I am satisfied that at some time on the afternoon of 20 May after they had arrived back at Cronulla, the offenders came to realise that they would not be able to physically lift the deceased’s body into the boat without some assistance. Accordingly, they went to Kennards Hire at Taren Point and hired a chain block for that purpose. The hiring fee was paid for by McNamara. At some point between the time that they returned from Kennards and the time at which they left Cronulla the following morning, they winched the deceased’s body into McNamara’s boat with the aid of the chain block.
	
	
	The disposal of the deceased’s body on 21 May 2014
	
	
	At 7.28am on 21 May 2014, McNamara was seen driving his blue Ford out of the underground car park of his premises, towing his boat. The blue tarpaulin which had been wrapped around the body of the deceased was clearly visible in the boat as it left the car park. McNamara parked the blue Ford and the boat outside the front of his premises and went back inside for a short time.
	
	
	McNamara and Rogerson were then seen in the lift of the premises at 7.32am. At that time McNamara was in possession of two fishing rods. The possession of those items was yet another act of subterfuge. McNamara and Rogerson were not about to go fishing. They were about to attend to the disposal of the deceased’s body.
	
	
	McNamara towed the boat to a ramp at Gray’s Point, followed by Rogerson. The boat was placed into the water and I am satisfied that the deceased’s body was thrown overboard at some time on the morning of 21 May 2014.
	
	
	There is no question that McNamara was on the boat at that time. He said that Rogerson was present with him. Rogerson admitted that he followed McNamara to the boat ramp, but said that he watched McNamara drive the boat away and waited for him to return. He denied being present on the boat at any time. According to Rogerson, he was waiting for McNamara to return so that he could speak with him about cleaning up storage unit 803. He also said that being present at the boat ramp and waiting for McNamara gave him an opportunity to think about “the dreadful things” that had occurred in the preceding 24 hours.
	
	
	There are a number of difficulties with this aspect of Rogerson’s account. Firstly, unless he intended to be part of the act of disposing of the deceased’s body, there was simply no reason for him to travel from his home in Padstow Heights, to McNamara’s premises at Cronulla, and then from McNamara’s premises to the boat ramp at Gray’s Point. He had had overnight to reflect upon “the dreadful things” that had occurred. He had also had ample opportunity to speak with McNamara about cleaning storage unit 803. He did not have to travel to the boat ramp, and wait for McNamara to return, for the purposes of having either of those discussions.
	
	
	It is also most unlikely that one person would have been physically capable of lifting the deceased’s body up from the floor of the boat, disposing of it over the side, and tending to the boat at the same time. Disposing of the deceased’s body was, in my view, a two person job.
	
	
	I am satisfied that having killed the deceased and secured the drugs, both offenders disposed of his body at sea with the clear intention that it would never be recovered, and their offending never detected. I am satisfied that Rogerson was in McNamara’s boat, and that he assisted in the disposal of the deceased’s body.
	
	
	Following that disposal, McNamara returned his boat to storage at HSS at about 11.03 am on 21 May 2014.
	
	
	After McNamara had returned the boat to HSS he and Rogerson drove to Rent-a-Space, arriving at about 12.32pm. They left at about 1.10pm. It is evident that during that period storage unit 803 was cleaned, obviously to ensure that no trace of what had happened on the previous day was left.
	


The movements of McNamara’s boat


	
	It is appropriate at this point to address the evidence of the movements of McNamara’s boat between 19 and 21 May 2014. Shortly put, the boat was removed from storage at HSS on 19 May 2014 and taken to Cronulla. On the afternoon of 20 May, the deceased’s body was placed in the boat whilst it was in the underground car park of McNamara’s premises. On the morning of 21 May the boat was used to dispose of the deceased’s body. A short time later it was returned to HSS.
	
	
	McNamara advanced a number of reasons for removing the boat from storage on 19 May 2014. Firstly, he said he wanted to take his daughter, Jessica, fishing before she left on an overseas holiday. His daughter gave evidence that she would regularly go fishing with her father and that she had done so on two or three occasions in 2014. She said that in 2014 she had booked to go on a holiday to Europe with a girlfriend. Although her evidence was a little confusing in this respect, it seems that she was due to leave Australia on Sunday 1 June 2014, and that she had planned to go fishing with her father on Saturday 31 May 2014.
	
	
	Secondly, McNamara said that whenever the boat was in storage, he was not able to “potter around” with it. He cited, in particular, the inability to charge the battery of the boat when it was in storage, and the necessity to carry out that task by way of a “trickle charger” elsewhere. According to McNamara, trickle chargers were not offered by HSS to its customers.
	
	
	Thirdly, he said that one of the tyres on the trailer was “a bit iffy” and he liked to check the tyre pressure.
	
	
	Fourthly, he said he had noticed that the boat had an oil leak.
	
	
	Finally, he said that he wished to measure the available space in the underground car park of his premises to determine if the boat could be stored there, rather than at HSS. He said that if this could be done, it would save him the cost of the monthly storage fee.
	
	
	It was the submission of the Crown that the circumstances surrounding the removal, use and return of McNamara’s boat between 19 and 21 May 2014 represented an important part of the planning associated with the joint criminal enterprise. Counsel for McNamara submitted that the movements of the boat had nothing to do with any such thing. He submitted that the boat became the vehicle for the disposal of the deceased’s body purely because it was “fortuitously and coincidentally” available to be used for that purpose.
	
	
	In assessing these competing submissions, and the evidence, it is necessary to make a number of observations.
	
	
	Firstly, at the time that the boat was removed from storage, the proposed fishing trip by McNamara and his daughter was not due to take place for some 12 days. For that intended purpose at least, there was no need to remove the boat from storage so far in advance.
	
	
	Secondly, it was also unnecessary for the boat to be removed from storage so far in advance for the purposes of determining whether or not it could fit in the available space within the underground car park of McNamara’s premises. That exercise could have been undertaken just as easily at the time of the proposed fishing trip, 12 days later.
	
	
	Thirdly, as far as the suggested oil leak is concerned, the boat was serviced by Neptune Marine on 7 April 2014, approximately 6 weeks before its removal from HSS on 19 May. Mr Ames from Neptune Marine gave evidence before the jury that he could not recall the presence of any oil leak at that time, nor could he recall any oil leak being drawn to his attention. He also confirmed that if an oil leak had been repaired, there would have been a reference to it on the invoice. The invoice for the service contained no such reference.
	
	
	Fourthly, there was evidence that in close proximity to the position at which McNamara’s boat had been stored at HSS there were double power points with extension leads. There was also evidence that HSS made chargers available to its customers for no fee. McNamara maintained that the availability of power points at HSS had “never entered his head” and that he was not aware of them. I do not accept his evidence in that regard. Moreover, the removal of a large boat from storage for the purposes of taking it to a charging device was a somewhat cumbersome way of going about things. There was nothing preventing a charger from being brought to the boat.
	
	
	Fifthly, the evidence before the jury was that when it was taken into the underground car park of McNamara’s premises of 19 May, the boat was placed in one of two available spaces. It follows that it must have been immediately evident to McNamara, upon his arrival at the car park on that day, that the available space was big enough to accommodate the boat. In circumstances where the boat was obviously able to fit in the space in the car park, it is impossible to reconcile McNamara’s stated desire to save money in storage fees with the fact of his return of the boat to storage on 21 May. Moreover, when he returned the boat to storage, McNamara had still not taken his daughter fishing, which was one of his stated reasons for removing the boat from storage in the first place.
	
	
	McNamara’s removal of the boat from storage on 19 May 2014, the subsequent placing of the deceased’s body in the boat on 20 May, the use of the boat on 21 May to dispose of the deceased’s body, and the immediate return of the boat to storage after that disposal, were not matters of coincidence. This was not a case in which the boat was fortuitously available for the purposes for which it was ultimately used. Its removal, use and return formed a significant aspect of the planning associated with the joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	I am satisfied that it was removed specifically for the purpose for which it was ultimately used, namely to dispose of the deceased’s body once he had been murdered.
	


The events of 22 May 2014


	
	On the morning of 22 May 2014 McNamara went to K-Mart Sylvania where he purchased pillow cases, a spoon and a jug. He later returned the chain block to Kennards.
	
	
	At approximately 11.11am on the same day Rogerson returned to Rent-a-Space in his own vehicle. Having pulled up outside storage unit 803, he unloaded the two office chairs that he had removed on 19 May and put them back in the storage unit. That, in my view, simply confirms that the two chairs had been removed on 19 May, not for Rogerson to use them at home, but to allow more room to allow for what had been planned to take place.
	
	
	There is no doubt that at some point on 20 May 2014, 2.7 kilograms of methylamphetamine was secreted in the white Falcon. There is also no doubt that between that time, and the seizure of the white Falcon by police on 24 May 2014, McNamara physically handled those drugs. Although there is no evidence that Rogerson did so, I am satisfied that he was clearly aware of the fact of the presence of the drugs in the white Falcon, and was aware of McNamara’s dealing with them.
	
	
	There is some evidence pointing to McNamara having physically removed the drugs from the white Falcon and taken them into his premises at one point. However I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did so. In any event, for the purposes of sentence, I do not regard that as a particularly material factor. Of more importance is the fact that McNamara handled the drugs and, I am satisfied, used the pillow cases that he had purchased at K-Mart for the purposes of repackaging them.
	
	
	What is also clear is that in the days following the deceased’s murder, both offenders were engaged in steps to make arrangements for the white Falcon to be towed from Cronulla to another location. Those attempts were made through a Mr Adam Borg (“Borg”) who operated a towing business. Borg was a friend of Rogerson who gave evidence at the trial. Having observed him give evidence, I formed the view that in respect of at least some of the answers he gave, Borg was not being truthful, and was doing his best to protect Rogerson’s interests.
	
	
	The respective accounts of the offenders as to the nature, purpose and content of their contact with Borg at or about this time were again at odds with each other. However, a number of things are clear. Firstly, on 22 May 2014, Rogerson called Borg. Secondly, on 23 May 2014 three calls were made to Borg from a payphone in Cronulla which I am satisfied were made by McNamara. Thirdly, Borg called each of McNamara and Rogerson on the morning of 24 May 2014.
	
	
	I am satisfied that all of those calls were related to arrangements, or attempted arrangements, to engage Borg to tow the white Falcon from Cronulla. However as events transpired, the police seized the white Falcon from the underground car park of McNamara’s premises in the early hours of 24 May 2014. The methylamphetamine remained in the vehicle at that time.
	
	
	It is evident that at some time later in the morning of 24 May, McNamara became aware that the white Falcon had been taken from the car park. He telephoned the building superintendent, Mr Edenton, and told him that he had “lost” his car. Rogerson was due to fly to Queensland on that day. McNamara went to the airport to speak with him late on the morning of 24 May 2014 before he left. I am satisfied that McNamara did so for the purposes of speaking to Rogerson about the white Falcon and to tell him that it had been taken from the car park. The two offenders had spoken to each other by telephone that morning. McNamara’s attendance at the airport was clearly designed to allow he and Rogerson to speak without fear of the fact, or the contents, of any conversation being revealed.
	
	
	What is also significant is that at 2.53pm on 24 May 2014, and again at 3.12pm on that day, a payphone in Caringbah was used to call Bonnette. I am satisfied that those calls were made by McNamara. By that time, he was obviously aware of the fact that the white Falcon had been seized. His purpose in ringing Bonnette was to alert him of that fact, given the role which had been played by Bonnette in the acquisition of the white Falcon.
	
	
	McNamara was arrested by police on 25 May 2014. Rogerson returned to New South Wales from Queensland on 27 May 2014, at which time he was also arrested.
	
	
	The deceased’s body was found floating in the ocean off Shelly Beach, Cronulla on 26 May 2014. The blue tarpaulin was still wrapped around him and the silver surfboard cover was visible.
	
	
	A post mortem examination of the deceased’s body was carried out by Dr Kendall Bailey on 27 May 2014. That examination revealed two projectiles within the deceased’s torso. Subsequent examination revealed two linear wound tracks or in other words, linear wounds which had penetrated through the body indicating the path of the projectiles.
	


THE OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENDING


	
	In the circumstances that I have outlined, and in light of the findings that I have made, the joint criminal enterprise to which each offender was a party was extensive in its planning, brutal in its execution, and callous in its aftermath.
	
	
	The number of meetings which took place between McNamara and the deceased, of which Rogerson was clearly aware, were designed to engender trust, in circumstances where the deceased had not even the slightest inkling of what was to happen to him. Obtaining a means of access to storage unit 803, acquiring a vehicle which was traceable to no-one and which was capable of carrying the body of a deceased person, co-ordinating activities, having available a receptacle into which to place the deceased’s body when killed, and then having a boat available to dispose of the deceased’s body at sea, were some, but not all, of the steps taken by the offenders in the course of the execution of the joint criminal enterprise. At all times, the offenders acted truly in company, a fact which was never more evident than on 20 May, both at Rent-a-Space and at Arab Road. The use of a weapon, the fact that the offences were committed in company, the fact that it was planned and the fact that it was committed for financial gain are all aggravating factors pursuant to s. 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Act”).
	
	
	Even in circumstances where there is no direct evidence of what actually occurred in storage unit 803, it is clear that the offenders acted with complete disregard for the life of another human being. It is noteworthy that in the course of giving evidence before the jury, and in answer to a question in cross-examination, Rogerson said:
	


“I had no respect for the deceased as a person. … I had no respect for this person as a decent person. As far as I knew he was a drug dealer”.


	
	On Rogerson’s evidence, he apparently had no respect for the deceased because the deceased was a drug dealer. However Rogerson has now been found guilty by a jury of murdering the deceased. That murder was carried out in order that Rogerson and McNamara could obtain possession of 2.78 kg of methylamphetamine. Despite Rogerson’s stated disdain for drug dealers, he and McNamara murdered the deceased to become drug dealers themselves. Given those circumstances, and as the Crown submitted, Rogerson’s stated lack of respect for the deceased because the deceased was a drug dealer is reflective of a position which is dripping with hypocrisy.
	
	
	The disposal of the deceased’s body at sea was both cruel and insensitive. It was done solely for the purpose of the offenders endeavouring to ensure that the deceased would never be found, rendering it all the more difficult for any responsibility to ever be attributed to either of them. It is also significant that the killing of the deceased was carried out so as to allow the offenders to profit by engaging in other serious criminal activity, namely the supply of a substantial quantity of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	It follows from all of those factors that the offending surrounding the deceased’s murder was of an exceptionally high degree of seriousness. Whether it falls into a worst case category, so as to warrant the imposition of a life sentence, is an issue to which I will come.
	
	
	Whilst the focus of the submissions of all parties was necessarily upon the murder count, one cannot lose sight of the fact that the offence of supplying a prohibited drug of which the offenders were also found guilty was also an offence of the utmost seriousness. Methylamphetamine, in particular, is a blight on the community. Given the verdicts of the jury, the offenders killed the deceased to “rip off” 2.78 kilograms of that drug. Evidence tendered by the Crown on sentence (without objection) established that the potential wholesale value of the drug in this case was between $540,000.00 and $702,000.00. In terms of its sale in the form of “street deals”, its potential value was between $9 million and $19 million.
	
	
	There is no evidence which establishes how, or in what form, the offenders were going to supply the drug to others. However the value of the drug, be it a wholesale value or otherwise, was substantial. The only available conclusion is that in acting as they did, the offenders were overwhelmed by greed. They intended that their greed be satisfied by engaging in the commission of a serious offence, over and above murdering the deceased.
	
	
	Viewed in this way, this was not just a case where the offending as a whole was motivated by the prospect of financial gain. It was a case in which that financial gain was to be realised by the participation in further serious criminal activity.
	
	
	In my view, on the whole of the evidence, there is nothing at all to materially distinguish the respective roles played by each offender.
	


THE CASES FOR EACH OFFENDER

McNamara


	
	In dealing with McNamara’s case, the first issue which should be addressed is his reliance upon duress as a mitigating factor.
	
	
	In his evidence before the jury, McNamara asserted that having shot the deceased dead, Rogerson immediately threatened to shoot him, and then threatened the safety of his daughters. It was McNamara’s case that each and every act that he committed immediately following the death of the deceased, up until his arrest on 25 May 2014, was done under duress because he was in fear of Rogerson. Directions were given to the jury as to the necessity for the Crown to negative, beyond reasonable doubt, the proposition that McNamara was acting under duress. It is clear from the verdicts that the jury were satisfied that the Crown discharged its onus in that respect.
	
	
	Section 21A(3)(d) of the Sentencing Act provides that it is a mitigating factor if an offender was acting under duress at the time of the offending. The onus of establishing duress for the purposes of mitigation is on the offender. However in the course of the hearing of submissions on sentence, a preliminary issue was raised as to whether, in light of the jury’s verdicts, it remained open to McNamara to rely upon duress in that way.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that because the jury had found McNamara guilty, there was “nothing left” in terms of duress upon which McNamara could rely. Counsel for Rogerson took a similar position. He submitted that the verdicts of the jury amounted to a rejection of “the duress defence as a reasonable possibility”. He further submitted that even if it were open to McNamara to seek to rely on duress as a mitigating factor on sentence, I would not be satisfied on the evidence that any threats were made by Rogerson.
	
	
	Counsel for McNamara submitted that notwithstanding the jury’s verdicts it remained open to McNamara to rely upon duress as a mitigating factor for the purposes of sentence. He argued that any submission to the contrary misunderstood the difference between fact finding by a jury, and fact finding by a judge for the purposes of sentence. Counsel for McNamara made particular reference to the directions which had been given to the jury in respect of the issue of duress. He submitted that in light of the issues which the jury were required to consider, there were a number of possible conclusions which might have been reached, not all of which involved a complete rejection of the allegation that threats had been made.
	
	
	The jury obviously rejected McNamara’s attempted reliance on duress. However, the basis upon which they did so is not known. In that regard, there are a number of possibilities. Firstly, it may be that the jury concluded that no threats were made to McNamara at all. Secondly, it is possible that a conclusion was reached that threats were made, but that McNamara was not driven to act as he did because of a genuine belief that if he did not so act, he or a member of his family would be killed or injured. Thirdly, it is possible that the jury concluded that threats were made which engendered such genuine belief in McNamara, but that such threats would not have driven a reasonable person to act as McNamara did. Fourthly, it is possible that the jury concluded that McNamara was threatened, that he had genuine belief of the kind to which I have referred, that such belief was of a kind to drive a reasonable person to act as he did, but that he could have avoided the effects of any duress by escaping from the threats without damage to himself or members of his family. It follows that the jury’s rejection of McNamara’s reliance on duress does not necessarily mean that a conclusion was reached that no threats were made to him at all.
	
	
	In these circumstances I do not accept the proposition that McNamara is now precluded from seeking to rely upon duress as a mitigating factor for the purposes of sentence. The relevance of non-exculpatory duress in mitigation of sentence may arise after trial and conviction, where duress has been a trial issue. The fact that the defence of duress has been rejected by the jury does not mean that threats or other conduct falling short of the defence cannot be taken into account on sentence: Tiknius v R (2011) 221 A Crim R 365; [2011] NSWCCA 215 at [37] per Johnson J (Tobias JA and Hall J agreeing) citing R v Olbach (2005) 65 NSWLR 75; [2005] NSWCCA 440 at [69]-[70] per Spigelman CJ (Sully and R S Hulme JJ agreeing).
	
	
	Whether McNamara has established, on the balance of probabilities, the fact of threats so as to be able to rely upon duress as a mitigating factor depends upon an assessment of the evidence. It is that issue to which I now turn.
	
	
	McNamara's evidence before the jury was that whilst he and Rogerson were in storage unit 803 on 20 May 2014, immediately following the deceased being shot dead, Rogerson pointed the gun directly at him (McNamara), threatened him with death if he did not assist, and threatened the safety of his daughters. According to McNamara, Rogerson made reference to taking the deceased to McNamara’s premises to see “(McNamara’s) lovely girls”. McNamara said that these words were said repeatedly by Rogerson in a menacing and aggressive tone, and that they led him to believe that Rogerson would harm him, and his daughters, if he did not do as Rogerson directed. On McNamara’s case, there were numerous subsequent references by Rogerson to McNamara’s “lovely girls”, to the point where McNamara said that he told Rogerson:
	
	
	“I’ve got the message, there’s no need to involve my kids”.
	
	
	On McNamara’s case, there was further threatening behaviour on the part of Rogerson at his (McNamara’s) home on the evening of 20 May. His daughter, Jessica, gave evidence of Rogerson making repeated references to McNamara’s “lovely lovely daughters”, whilst simultaneously tapping the right side of his trousers in which she had observed what she described as a “lump”. According to Ms McNamara, this caused her father to become “skittish”. She also gave evidence of McNamara exhibiting what might be described as an uneasy demeanour when she was with him at dinner later that evening. McNamara himself also asserted that whilst Rogerson was present in his premises he saw what appeared to be an object in the pocket of Rogerson’s pants, the shape of which was consistent with a gun.
	
	
	Further, according to McNamara, at a time when he and Rogerson were returning to shore on his boat having disposed of the deceased’s body, Rogerson fired two shots from a handgun which was in his possession, warning McNamara not to report what had occurred to the police. McNamara also gave evidence of an alleged threat of harm made by Rogerson at the airport on 24 May if Rogerson’s instructions as to the disposal of the white Falcon were not followed.
	
	
	McNamara also relied on evidence given by himself, his daughters, and his mother, that he had reported the threats to members of his family in the period immediately following his arrest.
	
	
	Finally, there was evidence given in the trial that Paul Kenny, Rogerson’s then solicitor, had visited Jessica McNamara following McNamara’s arrest and had said to her (inter alia) that it was “not the Triads that (she had) to worry about, it was Roger”. In the course of submissions, counsel for McNamara also relied upon this evidence to support McNamara’s case on duress.
	
	
	It was open to McNamara to go to the police immediately after he left Rent-a-Space on 20 May. Rather than pursue that option, he chose to return immediately to his home, with Rogerson following him. On the evidence, that was the very location at which he would have expected his daughters, who were said to be the subject of some of the alleged threats, to be present. There was no suggestion in the evidence that in the course of driving back to Cronulla from Rent-a-Space (a time at which he was not in Rogerson’s presence) McNamara telephoned either of his daughters, or anyone else, to tell them what had occurred, or to warn them of any impending danger.
	
	
	I have repeatedly viewed the CCTV footage from McNamara’s premises taken on the afternoon of 20 May 2014 and thereafter, both in the course of the trial and since that time. It must be acknowledged that a person’s outward demeanour in such footage is not necessarily a conclusive indicator of his or her frame of mind. However there is nothing in any of that footage, or in any of the photographs which were taken from it, which give any indications consistent with McNamara’s claims of duress. Indeed at 6.24pm on the evening of 20 May 2014, at a time when McNamara claims that he was in fear of Rogerson because of the threats that he made to him only a matter of hours earlier, McNamara was seen at his premises getting into a lift with Rogerson in possession of a “six pack” of beer, the obvious inference being that they were proceeding to McNamara’s apartment to share a drink.
	
	
	There is also evidence of a recorded telephone conversation between McNamara and Rogerson on the morning of 24 May, at which time Rogerson was due to travel to Queensland. Again, whilst it is obviously not conclusive, there is nothing discernible from McNamara’s voice which is consistent with being under the duress of Rogerson at the time.
	
	
	It is also significant that after the deceased was killed, five days passed before McNamara was arrested. On McNamara’s case, he was not party to any joint criminal enterprise, yet not once within that entire five day period did he approach anyone in authority to report what had occurred, or to specifically report the fact that he was acting under duress in (inter alia) disposing of the deceased’s body.
	
	
	Further, statements made by both McNamara and his daughter Jessica in recorded conversations following his arrest are, in my view, objectively at odds with an assertion of duress. For example, in a conversation recorded on 26 October 2014, Ms McNamara made reference to having spoken with “Anne”, and to the fact that such conversation had resolved “so many concerns”. The reference to “Anne” was clearly a reference to Anne Melocco, Rogerson’s wife. Ms McNamara described herself and Ms Melocco as having a “united front” to “stick together”. On the whole of the evidence, that might be viewed as being somewhat inconsistent with Ms McNamara’s safety having been threatened by Ms Melocco’s husband, in circumstances where she claimed to have seen a “lump” in his pocket.
	
	
	Moreover, statements made by McNamara himself during the course of conversations whilst he was in custody are also at odds with the proposition that he was under duress as a result of threats from Rogerson during the period following the deceased’s killing. In the same conversation with his daughter on 26 October 2014, and in the context of a discussion about a “witness coming forward”, McNamara told his daughter that he had “told Roger” who had “nearly done a frigging somersault” at the news. That statement, and the tone in which it was delivered, were not suggestive of a relationship in which one party was in fear of the other.
	
	
	In a later conversation with his daughter on 25 March 2015, McNamara made reference to the fact that he and “the old boy” were fine, that they were discussing the case “like two innocent people do”, and that it was “good” because they “had a laugh”. The reference to “the old boy” was clearly a reference to Rogerson. The relationship as described by McNamara which existed between them at that time was, in my view, inconsistent with the proposition that McNamara was ever in fear of him.
	
	
	There is also evidence that on 22 May 2014, Rogerson, McNamara and a number of their friends gathered together for a drink at the Crown Hotel, Revesby. The CCTV footage taken from those premises depicts all of those present, including McNamara and Rogerson, socialising together. Whilst again I accept that such evidence is not conclusive, there is nothing in terms of McNamara’s overt demeanour which would tend to support his claims of duress. Indeed, what is seen on that footage is very much to the contrary, in circumstances where Rogerson was one of those present.
	
	
	McNamara also gave evidence before the jury that Rogerson had directed him to search the white Falcon, retrieve the drugs and bring them to him at the Crown Hotel, Revesby on that day. There is no doubt that the drugs were in the white Falcon at that time, and that McNamara had handled them. There is also no doubt that McNamara did not do as he said he was directed, and did not bring the drugs to Rogerson at the hotel. It follows that on McNamara’s account, at the very time that he was said to be labouring under duress, he acted in complete defiance of the man of whom he maintained he was in fear, and who had threatened his safety, and the safety of his family.
	
	
	Similarly, according to McNamara, Rogerson had given him directions to arrange for the white Falcon to be towed from Cronulla by Borg. McNamara claimed that in telephoning Borg, he was attempting to cancel a tow which had already been arranged by Rogerson. If that is accepted, it would follow that in the very period in which he claims that he was under duress because of threats made to him by Rogerson, McNamara again openly defied Rogerson’s instructions.
	
	
	Finally, and to the extent that Mr Kenny’s evidence was relied upon in respect of this issue, I am satisfied that words to effect of those attributed to him by Ms McNamara were in fact said. However, I am not satisfied that they were said at the behest of Rogerson. Indeed, Mr Kenny’s evidence before the jury was that Rogerson was not even aware of the fact that he (Mr Kenny) had visited Ms McNamara.
	
	
	It is also significant that in the course being cross-examined, Ms McNamara agreed that one of the topics about which she spoke with her father in a conversation with him on 17 November 2014 was indeed Mr Kenny. She agreed that in the course of that conversation she referred to Mr Kenny as “the one that told me how I was gunna die”. On no view of the evidence did Mr Kenny ever threaten Ms McNamara with death. Ms McNamara expressly conceded as much when questioned further. Whilst the entirety of the evidence tends against McNamara’s claimed duress, this particular evidence provides a good example of Ms McNamara’s unreliability, and her tendency to exaggerate.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, I am not satisfied that duress is a mitigating factor in McNamara’s case.
	
	
	Subjectively, McNamara is presently 57 years of age. He has no previous convictions, which is a mitigating factor under s. 23(3)(e) of the Sentencing Act. He is divorced but maintains an amicable relationship with his former wife.
	
	
	McNamara joined the NSW Police Force in 1974 and subsequently became a detective. In that capacity he was responsible for the investigation of serious crimes and in 1986 was seconded to (the then) National Crime Authority. From 1987, he worked as a detective in Darlinghurst and Kings Cross, and was involved in extensive undercover police work, in the course of which he exposed a number of police who were acting corruptly. As a consequence of those matters, he is said to have become the target of murder threats. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and was placed into witness protection.
	
	
	Although he left the NSW Police in 1990, he claims that he continued to receive psychiatric and psychological treatment for a number of years thereafter as a consequence of matters to which he was exposed whilst a member of the police force. Although there is no medical evidence before the court, it is apparent that McNamara is currently prescribed a number of separate forms of medication, including antidepressants.
	
	
	Both of McNamara’s daughters, Jessica and Lucy, along with his former wife Cheryl, provided written testimonials to the court. Jessica McNamara described her father as “compassionate, empathetic and kind”. She made specific reference to the toll on her family generally, and her personally, as a consequence of McNamara’s arrest, incarceration and conviction. She expressed a firm belief “that the allegations put forward about (her) father in no way represent actions that are possible in (her) father’s nature”. Whilst acknowledging the jury’s verdicts, Ms McNamara stands firmly by her belief that her father is a person of a good nature and decent character. Whilst it would appear that Ms McNamara does not accept the jury’s verdicts, I accept her evidence regarding McNamara’s background, and his attention to his family.
	
	
	Similar sentiments were expressed by McNamara’s younger daughter, Lucy, who also gave evidence at the trial. She spoke of the support given to her by her father during her adolescence. She also spoke of the support which has continued to be provided to her by her father, notwithstanding his incarceration. She described the charges against him as being “the complete opposite of the man that raised (her)”.
	
	
	McNamara’s former wife Cheryl described McNamara’s character as being one of “high integrity, loyalty, honesty, commitment to justice and (commitment) to his family”. She made specific reference to what she described as his “nil tolerance” of drug use which, she said, was well known amongst those who were acquainted with him. She attested to the supportive role played by McNamara in the upbringing of his daughters, as well as the circumstances in which, when a police officer, he took steps to expose corruption in which other officers had engaged. She described the allegations against McNamara as “completely out of character”. Despite his conviction, she continues to support him as “a good man of the highest integrity, loyalty and honesty”.
	
	
	A number of other written testimonials were tendered from persons who have known McNamara for a long time, including his mother. Those persons variously attested to the positive contribution he has made to the community, his support for those close to him, and his commitment as a husband and father.
	
	
	In light of all of this evidence, I accept that McNamara is a person of otherwise good character, which is a mitigating factor pursuant to s. 21A(3)(f) of the Sentencing Act. At the same time, it must be said that his commission of the offences of which the jury found him guilty represents a dramatic departure from that position.
	
	
	It was put on behalf of McNamara that I should find that he is unlikely to re-offend, and that he has good prospects of rehabilitation, which are mitigating factors pursuant to s. 21A(3)(g) and (h) respectively of the Sentencing Act. In my view, there is no evidence to support either conclusion. Indeed, having regard to the Pre-Sentence report, it is clear that McNamara continues to claim his innocence. That is certainly not a matter of aggravation. However, it might be said that the prospects of rehabilitation depend, at least in part, upon an acceptance of the offending which gives rise to the need for rehabilitation.
	
	
	The absence of evidence simply does not allow me to reach a finding in relation to either of these issues.
	


Rogerson


	
	Rogerson is presently 75 years of age. He is also a former police officer. Tendered in his case on sentence were three medical reports of Dr Peter Malouf of 31 July 2014, 6 August 2014 and 4 May 2016, along with reports from the Department of Corrective Services. Dr Malouf has been treating Rogerson since July 2004. Although his reports make reference to Rogerson having been referred to a number of specialists over the years, the reports of those specialists have not been tendered. It is therefore not possible for me to confirm what, if any, diagnoses have been made by any of them. However, the report of 31 July 2014 of Dr Malouf makes reference to Rogerson suffering from:
	


generalised severe osteoarthritis;

hypertension;

gastro-oesophageal reflux;

gout;

diverticulitis.


	
	In April 2012 Rogerson underwent a right knee replacement and in October of the same year he underwent surgery for a repair of an avulsion tear of the muscle in his left hip. In August 2012, apparently whilst on holidays in Queensland, he underwent gastroscopy, colonoscopy and a blood transfusion to address significant bleeding.
	
	
	As at 2014, Rogerson was prescribed medication for hypertension, reflux, osteoarthritis and gout. He was also prescribed aspirin-like medication as a preventative measure in respect of myocardial infarction and stroke. There is evidence before me that special arrangements were required to be put in place for Rogerson’s transportation to and from court during the trial. Those reports variously described him as being “aged and frail”, having a “permanent disability” and suffering from “hip problems, osteoarthritis and mobility issues”. Although there is no direct evidence, it was put to me, and I accept, that Rogerson is incarcerated in an area reserved for persons of advanced years.
	
	
	In 1992 Rogerson was convicted of conspiring to pervert the course of justice and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. In 2001 he was convicted of managing a corporation, without leave of the court, within five years of his release from prison. He was released on a good behaviour bond for a period of 2 years. In 2005 he was convicted of giving false evidence and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Those convictions are, of course, of a completely different nature to those presently under consideration. Rogerson has no criminal history of violent offending.
	
	
	As is the case with McNamara, the evidence does not permit me to make any finding as to Rogerson’s prospects of rehabilitation, or the likelihood of him offending again.
	
	
	THE DETERMINATION OF AN APPROPRIATE SENTENCE
	
	
	Submissions of the Crown
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the offence of murder of which the offenders had been found guilty was in the worst category, and attracted the application of the provisions of s. 61(1) of the Sentencing Act. The Crown did not make that submission in respect of the supply count, although it was submitted that this was also highly serious offending.
	
	
	Counsel for McNamara submitted that having regard to the terms of s. 61, only cases falling within the rubric of a “worst case” category should attract a life sentence. Counsel submitted that even if I were to accept the submissions of the Crown, and find that the joint criminal enterprise involved a planned murder in order to access dangerous illegal drugs for profit, those circumstances would not, of themselves, place the present offending within a worst case category. It was submitted that I should sentence both offenders on the basis that the offending was constituted by an illegal drug transaction which had “careered out of control and culminated in an improvised homicide.” It was submitted that such a finding would not be inconsistent with the verdicts of the jury. For the reasons already expressed, that is not an accurate categorisation of the offending.
	
	
	Counsel for Rogerson also submitted that s. 61 of the Sentencing Act had no application, and that I would not be satisfied that Rogerson’s level of culpability in the commission of the offence of murder was so extreme as to justify the imposition of a life sentence. It was submitted that I would find that the commission of the offences was amateurish, unprofessional, poorly planned and poorly executed. It was further submitted that in light of Rogerson’s age, the practical reality was that any sentence imposed would amount to a life sentence. In terms of the offence of murder, counsel submitted that Rogerson’s offending fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	Consideration
	
	
	Section 61(1) of the Sentencing Act is in the following terms:
	


61 Mandatory life sentences for certain offences

(1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.


	
	In Knight v R (2006) 164 A Crim R 126; [2006] NSWCCA 292, McClellan CJ at CL made the following observations regarding the operation of s.61(1) (at [23]):
	


“Section 61(1) has been the subject of consideration in a number of decisions. It is not necessary to analyse them for present purposes beyond a statement of the following principles:

· the maximum penalty for an offence in the case of murder, life imprisonment, is intended for cases falling within the worst category of case for which that penalty is prescribed: Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-452.

· it is not possible to prescribe a list of cases falling within the worst category – ingenuity can always conjure up a case of greater heinousness: Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 478; R v Petroff (unreported, 12 November 1991 – Hunt CJ at CL).

· a life sentence is not reserved only for those cases where the offender is likely to remain a continuing danger to society for the rest of his or her life or for cases where there is no chance of rehabilitation; the maximum may be appropriate where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met by a sentence of life imprisonment; R v Kalazich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 at (50-1); R v Baker (unreported, CCA 20 September 1995); R v Garforth (unreported CCA 23 May 1994).

· in many cases a two stage approach to the consideration of whether the maximum penalty should be imposed is appropriate. Firstly, consideration is given to whether the objective gravity of the offence brings it within the worst class of case and then consideration is given to whether the subjective circumstances of the offender require a lesser sentence: R v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466; R v Valera [2002] NSWCCA 50.

· it is the combined effect of the four indicia in s 61(1) which is critical: R v Merritt (2004) 59 NSWLR 557.

· the absence of any one or more of the indicia of retribution, punishment, community protection or deterrence may make it more difficult for a sentencing judge to reach the conclusion that a life sentence is required although will not be determinative: Merritt at 559.”


	
	I have canvassed, at length, the circumstances of the offending, and I have identified those matters which, in my view, characterise its objective seriousness. There are, in my view, no factors which mitigate the offending.
	
	
	The extreme culpability contemplated by s. 61(1) has been held to be in accordance with the approach taken a common law: R v Merritt (2004) 59 NSWLR 557; [2004] NSWCCA 19 at [51] per Wood CJ at CL (Tobias JA and Hidden J agreeing). At common law, a worst case is characterised by being able to point to particular features which are heinous, and by reference to which it is possible to postulate the absence of any circumstances mitigating the offending (as opposed to circumstances mitigating the penalty to be imposed): R v Twala (NSWCCA, 4 November 1994, unreported) per Badgery-Parker J (Carruthers and Finlay JJ agreeing). In that sense, “heinous” means (inter alia) detestable or grossly reprehensible: R v Arthurell (SC(NSW) 3 October 1997, Hunt CJ at CL, unreported). However, as pointed out in Knight, it is the combined effect of the four indicia in s. 61(1) which is crucial to a determination of whether a life sentence ought be imposed.
	
	
	Two of those indicia, retribution and punishment, may be conveniently considered together. The present offending involved a planned murder which had, as one of its objects, the possession of a substantial quantity of methylamphetamine for supply. The community has a legitimate expectation that the punishment for such offending will properly reflect the high level of criminality that has been displayed. The matters to which I have already referred, and which categorised the present offending, are in my view properly described as heinous.
	
	
	As I have noted, it was submitted, at least on behalf of Rogerson, that the offending was “amateurish” and “unprofessional”. In my view, there is nothing amateurish or unprofessional about (for example) acquiring a motor vehicle which could not be traced, or having a boat ready and available as a means of disposing of the body of a deceased person. Such matters reflect careful, rather than poor, planning. In my view, there was nothing amateurish or unprofessional about the offending. The fact that aspects of it were captured on CCTV footage demonstrates, not that the offending was amateurish and unprofessional, but that it was audacious.
	
	
	What is also relevant in this context is the fact that the offenders murdered the deceased in order to engage in further offending, the commission of which would have brought them considerable financial gain. It has been observed that a deliberate killing for payment may find its way into the worst category of case, and thus have the potential for the imposition of the maximum penalty of life imprisonment: Burrell v R (2007) 190 A Crim R 148; [2007] NSWCCA 65 at [328] per McClellan CJ at CL (Sully and James JJ agreeing) and the authorities cited therein. In my view, there is no relevant distinction to be drawn between a deliberate killing for payment in the nature of what is often described as a “contract killing”, and the circumstances of the present offending. On any view of it, the present offending was a form of deliberate killing for payment. The fact that the payment in the present case was to be derived by the offenders, not from monies received from a third party pursuant to a “contract”, but rather by engaging in further serious criminal activity, does not, in my view, render the present offending any less serious.
	
	
	A further consideration in the context of s. 61(1) is the necessity for the community to be protected against planned and violent offending of this nature. Unlike the position which arises from time to time in matters such as this, there is no medical or other evidence before me which goes directly to the question of whether either offender presents a further danger to the community upon release. In that regard, I am left to draw such inferences as might be available from the circumstances of the offending.
	
	
	There are obviously a number of disturbing aspects of the offending, for which neither offender has expressed any remorse. Indeed, the Pre-Sentence report prepared on behalf of McNamara specifically states that he continues to “adamantly espouse his innocence”. Absence of remorse is not an aggravating factor. However, there is no evidence at all which even remotely suggests that either offender has accepted the verdicts of the jury. That, along with the circumstances of the offending as I have outlined them, points towards both offenders representing a continuing danger to the community. However even if I did not come to that conclusion, its absence would not, of itself, prevent the application of s. 61(1): Merritt at [54].
	
	
	I am also satisfied that deterrence, both general and specific, are of particular significance in this case. Any sentence to be imposed must be such as to deter the offenders, as well as others who might be minded to engage in acts of this nature for illegal monetary gain.
	
	
	Further, both offenders are former police officers. That does not aggravate the offending as such, but it is a matter which, in my view, bears upon the question of deterrence. Aspects of their commission of these crimes reflect the fact the offenders put to use, for all the wrong reasons, knowledge and experience that they gained as a consequence of their investigation of criminal offences when they were members of the police force. It is necessary to impose a sentence which will deter any person in a similar position who might be minded to use knowledge and experience of that kind in a manner which is the antithesis of upholding the law.
	
	
	The subjective features in McNamara’s case are limited. They are even more so in the case of Rogerson. Mitigating factors are necessarily relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence. However in the present case, they are of limited significance. The nature of the offending was, in my view, so grave that such subjective circumstances as are made out on the evidence should be disregarded: Adanguidi v R (2006) 167 A Crim R 295; [2006] NSWCCA 404 at [34] citing R v Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409; [2000] NSWCCA 469 at [103].
	
	
	In all of these circumstances it is my view that the provisions of s. 61(1) of the Sentencing Act are applicable, and that in respect of the murder count, a life sentence should be imposed in each case.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	In respect of the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, the offender Glen Patrick McNamara is sentenced to a non-parole period of 9 years imprisonment commencing on 25 May 2014 and concluding on 24 May 2023 with an additional term of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 25 May 2023 and expiring on 24 May 2026.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.

Criminal law—Seduction under promise of
marriage—Previous illicit connection—Previous
chastity of complainant—Findings of the jury—Arts. 210, 212, 1002, 1140 Cr. C.

APPEAL from the
judgment of the Appellate Divi­sion of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], dismissing, on equal division of the court, the appeal by the
appellant from the refusal of Simmons J., at the trial with a jury, to reserve a case for the opinion of
the Appellate Division.

The material
facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully
stated in the above head-note and in the
judgments now reported.

W. F. O'Connor K.C. for the appellant. W. L. Scott
for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—This was an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta which, on an equal division of
opinion, refused to quash a
conviction against the appellant prisoner under section 212  of the
Criminal Code  for having, under promise of
marriage, seduced and had illicit
connection on or about the 27th day of March, 1919, with one Mary Kovack, an unmarried female under the age of 21 years.

Two questions
only were raised and argued at bar : one, whether the evidence of Mary Kovack, the female in question, was corroborated or not; and
the other, whether she
was at the time of the alleged offence of previously
chaste character.

After hearing
Mr. O'Connor, counsel for the appel­lant, on the question of corroboration, we were unanimously of the opinion that there was
sufficient evi­dence of corroboration, and Mr. Scott was not called on to reply on that point.

The second
question raised a much more delicate and difficult point: Was the jury justified in not finding the complainant Mary Kovack, at the
time of the illicit
connection of the 27th March between her and the prisoner, a girl of previously unchaste
character?

The material facts necessary to reach a
conclusion on that point are fully set in
the learned judge's reasons given in
the Appellate Division (1). The

[Page 90]

As to the signature of the witnesses at the
request of the testator, undoubtedly this is a requirement of article 851 C.C.,
although it is not mentioned in the English Wills Act, 1 Vict., ch. 26, from
which article 851 C.C. is derived. But it is to be remarked that when the will
is signed or marked by another person than the testator, article 851 requires
the ""express direction"" of the testator, while with regard to
the signature of the witnesses at the request of the testator, nothing is said
as to the form of this request. In my opinion, inasmuch as the legislature, in
speaking of the direction or request of the testator, requires it to be
expressed in one case and not in the other, it follows that this request can,
in the latter case, be implied by reason of the circumstances surrounding the
execution of the will. Here Mellor testified that Mrs. Wynne, when the
witnesses and she had walked right up to the bed, asked them if they would be
witnesses and put their signatures on the will, and that she said this aloud to
both of them. The request she thus made to James and Mellor must have been
heard by Wynne, who then signed the will and saw or could see the witnesses
sign it in his presence. In my opinion, but I say this with every deference for
the majority of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench who thought
otherwise, it would be pushing formalism too far to reject this will for the
lack of an expressed request of the testator to the witnesses, and the more so
as this is an essentially simple and popular form of will, which undoubtedly
the legislature desired to render as easy as possible to the least educated of
the population.

If it be contended that Mrs. Wynne who went for
the witnesses and asked them to attest the will, had no mandate from Wynne to
do so, I would answer

[Page 91]

that evidently no express mandate was required.
And the question really is whether Wynne intended to make a will and dispose in
favour Of his wife, and unless Mrs. Wynne's testimony be discredited, I must
find that he did. The obtaining of witnesses, although essential, was not,
under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, a matter requiring any kind
of mandate from the testator, for if we must take it as established that he
wished to make a will, getting the witnesses necessary for the validity of the
will was merely carrying out his desire.

It may be that this will is quite near to the
danger point, but after full consideration I find myself unable to set it aside
and nullify the very natural and reasonable disposition which Wynne made of his
property, for he and his wife had been long married and had no children. Of
course, Tuck's affidavit in support of the probate was untrue, as he did not
see Wynne sign the will, although he probably could identify his signature. But
nothing would now be gained by annulling the probate, for the testimony of
James and Mellor shews that Wynne really signed the will. And, in my opinion,
the attack on the will itself fails.

I would therefore allow the appeal with costs
here and in the Court of King's Bench and restore the judgment of the learned
trial judge.

Appeal allowed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
ALBERTA.

Extradition—Specific offence—Conviction for similar offence—""Extradition
Act "", R.S.C. [1906] c. 155, s. 32.

[Page 133]

B. was extradited to Canada from the United States on a charge
of fraud by instigating the publication in a newspaper, the News-Telegram, of
a false statement that oil had been struck in a well in which he was
interested. He was convicted in Canada of the offence of fraud in concurring in
the publication of the same false statement in another newspaper no mention of
which was made in the proceedings before the Extradition Commissioner.

Held, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that B. was
convicted for an offence other than the one on which the warrant for
extradition issued and the conviction should be quashed.

APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta[1],
confirming, by an equal division of opinion, the conviction of the appellant by
the trial judge.

The circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now
reported.

A. A. McGillivray for the appellant.

R. C. Smith K.C. and G. G. Hyde for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—The facts of this case are fully set
out by my brothers Duff and Anglin. To avoid a wearisome repetition, I refer to
their opinions.

[Page 134]

There can, of course, be no doubt, that, under the Treaty with
the United States, a fugitive criminal may not be committed for extradition,

except upon such evidence of
criminality as according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person
so charged shall be found would justify his apprehension and commitment for
trial, if the crime or offence had been there committed.

It is equally certain that the person surrendered shall not be
triable for any offence other than the offence for which he was surrendered,
until he shall have an opportunity of returning to the country by which he was
surrendered.

The nature of the offence for which the accused was extradited
must therefore be gathered from the warrant and the depositions filed before
the extradition commissioner, and those depositions must disclose the facts
which, according to the laws of the place where the person charged is found,
amount to the crime for which he is subsequently tried. I was at first disposed
to hold that the indictment on which the accused was tried, being drafted in
the very terms of the information upon which he had been committed by the
police magistrate and subsequently held for extradition, it was impossible to
say that he was tried for an offence different from that for which he was
extradited. But, having looked at the case of Reg. v. Balfour, which
is unfortunately very imperfectly reported in 30 L.J. News, p. 615, I have come
to a different conclusion. In that case certain counts which were challenged as
not warranted by the extradition papers were withdrawn by the Crown and the
trial and conviction proceeded on the counts not open to this challenge. The
inference would appear to be that there is no jurisdiction to try a fugitive
criminal in England for any offence not disclosed by the depositions, &c,
on which his extradition was obtained.

[Page 135]

Reference was made, at the argument, to United States v. Rauscher[2],
but there the prisoner was extradited on a charge of murder and tried for a
lesser offence, which was not included in the treaty. The opinion expressed,
however, by Mr. Justice Miller, as speaking for the full court, seems to
support the contention that the person surrendered may not be prosecuted for an
offence which is not mentioned in the demand, that is, in the warrant or
depositions. The reason for this rule would seem to be that the demand for
extradition is a criminal proceeding and the accused has a right, not only to
cross-examine, but to adduce evidence before the magistrate, and in order to
enable him to do this effectively he is entitled to be informed of the specific
offence with which he is charged. The publication of a statement on one day in
a newspaper cannot be said to constitute the same offence as the publication in
another newspaper on another day of a statement which may, or may not be to the
same effect or identical with the first. On the extradition proceedings, the
only statement proved was the one published by Tyron in the News-Telegram. At
the trial the statement relied upon, which was said to be the subject of the
charge, was that published by Creely in the Albertan, which was not
before the extradition commissioner, and it cannot, therefore, be said that he
was extradited for having concurred in the publication of that statement.

I would, therefore, allow the appeal on the short ground, that in
view of the fact that the particulars furnished at the trial for the purpose of
describing the means by which the offence charged in the indictment was
committed, refer to a statement different from the one mentioned in the
depositions before the extradition

[Page 136]

commissioner, it cannot be said that this
indictment corresponds as it should with the depositions and information used
for the application for extradition.

The appeal should be allowed with costs.

IDINGTON J. (dissenting)—The claim that the
appellant was tried for some offence for which he was not surrendered by the
United States is, in my opinion, unfounded.

We have not, as perhaps we should have, before us the information
laid before the United States Commissioner, and therefore, are left to
inference regarding its contents.

That I submit is a difficulty in the way of appellant, who has
been convicted in a prosecution under and pursuant to the terms of a warrant of
surrender which appears to be as follows:—

Department of State.

To all to whom these Presents
shall come,

Greetings:

Whereas, His Excellency Sir Cecil Arthur Spring-Rice,
Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Great Britain,

Accredited to this Government, has made requisition in
conformity with the provisions of existing treaty stipulations between the
United States of America and Great Britain for the mutual delivery of
criminals, fugitives from justice in certain cases, for the delivery up of
George E. Buck, charged with the crime of fraud by a director and officer of a
company, committed within the jurisdiction of the British Government;

And whereas, the said George E. Buck has been found within
the jurisdiction of the United States, and has, by proper authority and due
form of law, been brought before Paul J. Wall, Commissioner in Extradition for
the District of Kansas, for examination upon said charge of fraud by a director
and officer of a company;

And whereas, the said Commissioner has found and adjudged
that the evidence produced against the said George E. Buck is sufficient in law
to justify his commitment upon the said charge, and has, therefore, ordered
that the said George E. Buck be committed pursuant to the provisions of said
treaty stipulations.

Now, therefore, pursuant to the provisions of section 5272
of the Revised Statutes of the United States, these presents are to require

[Page 137]

the United States Marshal for the
District of Kansas, or any other public officer or person having charge or
custody of the aforesaid George E. Buck, to surrender and deliver him up to
such person or persons as may be duly authorized by the Government of Great
Britain to receive the said George E. Buck to be tried for the crime of which he
is so accused.

In testimony whereof, I have hereunto signed my name and
caused the Seal of the Department of State to be affixed.

Done at the City of Washington, this 3rd day of July, 1916,
and of the Independence of the United States the 140th.

ROBERT LANSING,

Secretary of State.

James Short,

Agent of the Attorney-General.

Surely the fair inference is that the warrant is founded upon and
follows in its terms the charge as laid before the Commissioner, and that we
have not the right to impute to the Commissioner a neglect of duty in that
regard.

Then we have the evidence, put before the Commissioner, of a
number of witnesses. That given by Fletcher, proving an admission of the
appellant relative to the publication in the Albertan, is in general
terms and seems wide enough to cover any statement put forth by that newspaper
at or about the time in question such as testified by Cheely.

There does not seem to have been anything specifically limiting
the inquiry before the Commissioner in the United States who had to consider
the demand for the extradition of appellant.

Moreover, the trip of Mr. Cheely to the well in question was
testified to by at least one witness whose evidence as well as that of Fletcher
appears in the deposition submitted to that officer. And the witness so
testifying remarks gravely, when pressed as to the nature of the business in
hand on that occasion and the purpose of taking Cheely with others concerned,
he did not think Cheely had gone merely for the ride. I agree.

[Page 138]

There was clearly evidence before the Commissioner bearing upon
the offence of which appellant is convicted, such as, if nothing else in the
case before the Commissioner, would have entitled him to have certified as
required by the statute and the Department of State, which had thereby, before
it, a copy of the entire evidence, to have acted in issuing said warrant.

What is a fair presumption, seeing accused was surrendered upon
such a warrant?

Is it not that for anything pointed to in the evidence likely to
justify a prosecution for the offence set forth it was intended to be covered
and he to be tried therefor?

The fact that there were several other charges of a like kind
alleged to have taken place about the same time by another issue of falsehood
does not help the accused, it seems to me, but rather tends to justify the
surrender as related to any or all of them.

Much has been made of an error in relation to these other charges
which seems beside what is, in law, involved herein.

It is not such informations, as laid before magistrates in this
country, that is the test, but that which appears on the whole case before the
Commissioner as containing evidence upon which such a warrant could issue.

The informations laid in this country are but a means for getting
evidence in a judicial proceeding which can be said to have been taken under
the sanction of an oath and when presented to a foreign Commissioner may, as
happened herein, constitute but a part of the entire evidence upon which the
Commissioner may act.

I have no manner of doubt, the surrender was intended to cover,
and did cover, any of the numerous

[Page 139]

offences made to appear in the evidence
before him, in such manner as would justify one of our own magistrates
committing for trial.

I think, therefore he was convicted of an offence within the
grounds upon which he was surrendered, and upon evidence thereof disclosed in
the material laid before the Commissioner as expressive of the purposes of
those demanding his surrender, and assented to thereby.

The case as presented to us involves no other question within our
jurisdiction and hence the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

DUFF J.—The defendant was convicted after a trial at
Calgary under section 414  of the Criminal Code  of the offence of concurring, as
director of a public company, in making, circulating or publishing a statement
which he knew to be false in a material particular, with the intent described
in the section. The sole ground of appeal which I propose to consider (because,
I think, on that ground the appellant is entitled to succeed) consists in the
proposition advanced on behalf of the appellant that he, the appellant, having
been surrendered by a foreign state, the United States of America, in pursuance
of article three of the Extradition Convention of 1889 with that State, has in
the proceedings out of which the appeal arises, been convicted of an offence,
other than the offence for which he was surrendered in contravention of that
article and of section 32 of the ""Extradition Act ,"" R.S.C. 1906, ch.
155.

The substance of the conviction is stated in the judgment of the
trial judge in the following words:—

That between the 7th and 9th of May, George E. Buck was
guilty of the charge as laid, and that he did, in the City of Calgary, concur

[Page 140]

in publishing a statement, which
statement was known to him to be false in a material particular, with intent to
induce persons to become shareholders of the Black Diamond Oil Fields, Ltd.

The prosecution of the appellant was commenced on the fifteenth
of October, 1915, when three informations were laid against him before the
Police Magistrate at Calgary. By two of these informations, charges of
conspiracy were preferred and by the third, a charge that the appellant at the
City of Calgary, on or about the 7th of May, 1914, concurred in making a false
statement within the meaning of section 414  of the Criminal Code , with the
intent there mentioned. In May, 1916, the appellant having been found in the
State of Kansas, extradition proceedings were commenced against him on the
complaint of the Province of Alberta and by this complaint the appellant was
charged with the offences set forth in the three informations already referred
to and with nothing else. The appellant was delivered over to the Province of Alberta
on the authority of a warrant of the Secretary of State of the United States of
America on the third of July, 1916, for trial upon the third of the
above-mentioned charges, the charge under section 414  of the Criminal Code , his
surrender upon the charge of conspiracy being refused; and the warrant recited
that requisition had been made for the delivery of the appellant ""charged
with the crime of fraud by a director and officer of a company"" and
required the officer having custody of the appellant, to surrender him
""to-be tried for the crime of which he is so accused.""

The appellant's attack upon the proceedings is this. The
substance of the charge against him both before the Magistrate in Calgary and
before the Extradition Commissioner under section 414  of the Criminal Code  was,
he avers, that he concurred in the publication on

[Page 141]

the 7th of May, of a certain
""statement"" which was put in evidence consisting of an article in a
newspaper published in Calgary, the News-Telegram. This, he says, was
really the ""charge"" made against him before the Extradition
Commissioner; and the crime so imputed to him, concurring in the publication of
the ""statement"" mentioned on the information, was the crime referred
to in the warrant of the Secretary of State as that with which he is there said
to be ""charged"" or ""accused"" and for trial upon which he
was surrendered.

It is not disputed that if the appellant is right in this, the
appeal ought to succeed; for it is quite apparent that the learned trial judge
acquitted the appellant of any criminal offence in the publication of the 7th
of May, in the News-Telegram and that the judgment against him in
general terms that he concurred in the publication of a false statement between
the ""7th and 9th of May"" is when translated into concrete terms,
neither more nor less than judgment against him for the offence of concurring
in the publication of a false statement on the 9th of May, having reference to
a ""statement"" published in another newspaper through the instrumentality
of other persons and differing in most material particulars from that published
on the 7th.

Without attempting to express any general opinion as to the
effect of the words ""prospectus, statement or account"" in section 414 
of the Criminal Code , there can, I think, be very little doubt (assuming an
offence was committed under that section by publishing or by concurring in
publishing the ""statement"" which appeared in the Albertan on
the 9th) that this offence was a distinct offence from any committed (if one
had been committed) in publishing or concurring in publishing

[Page 142]

the earlier statement in the News-Telegram
on the 7th of May. The two statements, as I have mentioned, differ in most
material respects, so much so indeed, that the learned trial judge has held
that while the publication of the second statement was an offence, the
publication of the first statement was not an offence; and it could not
plausibly be contended that what was done on the 9th or on the 8th, in
procuring the publication of the second statement on the 9th, was only the
culminating step in a single offence which originated in the steps taken to
procure the publication of the article which had appeared on the 7th.

And it is closely ad rem to observe that a charge of
publishing the statement which appeared on the 7th, is obviously and admittedly
a very different accusation from the charge of publishing the statement which
appeared on the 9th; admittedly I say, because of the fact just alluded to,
namely that the second was held to be criminal and the first comparatively
innocuous.

The appellant then having been convicted of the offence of
concurring in the publication of the ""statement"" which appeared on
the 9th, in the. Albertan, does it appear that he was not surrendered to
be tried for that offence? The answer to that question, as the observations
already made imply, turns upon the answer to the question, was that the offence
or one of the offences with which he was ""charged"" or
""accused"" within the meaning of the warrant of surrender? The
direction in the extradition warrant is broad enough no doubt, to cover the
charge of criminality in the publication of either ""statement""; and
it would be no valid objection, assuming two offences to have been charged,
that they should be both dealt with in one commital, Re Meunier[3],.and
there was, in my judgment,

[Page 143]

in the depositions before the Extradition
Commissioner evidence which would have justified a commital upon a
""charge"" in respect of the publication of the second
""statement"" if such a charge had been preferred.

But, was such a ""charge"" before the Extradition
Commissioner? I have already mentioned the fact that the ""statement""
which appeared in the News-Telegram was actually put in evidence in
support of the information laid before the Magistrate in Calgary. This was the
only ""statement"" shewn to be false in any particular, of which
evidence was offered by the prosecution before the Magistrate. It is quite true
that counsel for the defence brought out in cross-examination of one of the
witnesses a reference to a remark alleged to have been made by the appellant,
which I think the Magistrate might have held amounted to sufficient evidence of
an admission that a ""statement"" had been published in the Albertan
which was false in a material particular and a criminal statement within
section 414 . But this isolated passage in the cross-examination of one of the
witnesses was not followed up; no fresh information was laid, the existing
information was not amended, the article in the Albertan was not
produced; and when the complaint was made before the Extradition Commissioner,
based entirely upon the evidence taken in Calgary, it was laid in terms
identical, as regards the charge under section 414 , with the terms of the
information. When to these circumstances we add the fact that the article
published on the 9th, was offered in evidence at the trial, not in proof of the
publication of it or the concurring of the publication of it as a substantive
offence, but as evidence of acts similar to the acts charged and pointing to
the fraudulent intent of the appellant in

[Page 144]

relation to those acts, the inference
seems to be that no ""charge"" was intended to be laid in relation to
the publication of the 9th, until the trial stage, at least, was reached.

By article, 10 of the Treaty of 1842, ""all persons who being
charged with"" crimes of the kinds specified, ""committed within
the jurisdiction"" of either of the contracting powers ""found within
the territories of the other"" are, on requisition, to be delivered up,

provided that this
shall only be done upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws
of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found,
would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime or
offence had been there committed.

A surrender under the treaty presupposes a charge within the
meaning of this article and although it is perhaps unnecessary to cite
authority I refer to pp. 422 & 423 of Moore on Extradition, paragraph 288,
in which it is pointed out that it is essential that the offence
""charged"" should be averred in a manner sufficiently explicit to
enable the party accused to understand precisely what he is ""charged""
with. That was laid, down in the case of Farez[4],
and it is, I think, indisputably correct. It must be assumed that the
Extradition Commisioner acted in the spirit of this principle and that the
appellant was committed under that ""charge"" which was clearly laid
and in respect of which it is not disputed that there was evidence sufficient
to justify a commital and not in respect of something which, it must be
inferred, was not intended to be and was not in fact ""charged""
although suggested with more or less distinctness in the evidence; we must in a
word, assume that the Commissioner acted in accordance with the fundamental
principle of sound legal procedure, which requires that an accused

[Page 145]

person shall have notice, not only of the
evidence against him, but of the nature of the "" charge "" supposed to
be established by the evidence.

In my opinion the appeal ought to succeed.

ANGLIN J.—The substantial question on this appeal, on
which the learned judges of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
Alberta were equally divided in opinion, is whether the charge on which the
accused was convicted is ""the offence (the extradition crime) for which he
was surrendered"" within the meaning of article three of the Extradition
Treaty between Great Britain and the United States and within section 32 of
""The Extradition Act ,"" R.S.C. [1906], ch. 155.

It is, in my opinion, incontrovertible that ""the offence for
which (the accused) was surrendered"" means the specific offence with the
commission of which he was charged before the Extradition Commissioner and in
respect of which that official held that a prima facie case had been
established and ordered his extradition, and not another offence or crime,
though of identical legal character and committed about the same time and under
similar circumstances. The Supreme Court of the United States so held in Re
Rauscher[5]. In
delivering the judgment of the court Mr. Justice Miller said, at p. 424:—

That right (of an extradited person), as we understand it,
is that he shall be tried for only the offence with which he is charged in the
extradition proceedings and for which he was delivered up.

I do not entertain the slightest doubt that this is a correct
statement of the law under the present treaty and the Canadian statute, the
former of which, in terms restricts the right of trying an extradited person to
""the offence for which he was surrendered"" while

[Page 146]

the latter prohibits his prosecution or
punishment in Canada, ""in contravention of any of the terms of the
(extradition) arrangement * * * for any other offence"" than the
extradition crime of which he was accused or convicted and in respect of which
he was surrendered.

It is perhaps worth noting that the stipulation in the Ashburton
Treaty of 1842, construed in the Rauscher Case[6],
was wider than that now in force. It provided against detainer or trial of the
person surrendered for any offence committed prior to his surrender, other than
the extradition crime proved by the facts on which the surrender is
grounded.

The defendant has been convicted of an offence against section
414  of the Criminal Code , in having, while president and manager of the Black
Diamond Oil Fields Ltd., concurred in the circulation or publication of a statement
known to him to be false in a material particular, with intent to induce
persons to become shareholders in that corporation.

Now it appears in evidence that an article was published in a
Calgary newspaper (the News-Telegram) on the 7th May, 1914, in which it
was falsely stated that the Black Diamond Oil Fields Ltd. had struck oil at
their well near Black Diamond, and that the defendant had procured the
publication of this article through one Tyron, a reporter on the staff of that
newspaper. This was the only ""statement"" proved on the preliminary
investigation before the Police Magistrate into the charges against the
defendant.

On the 8th of May, 1914, as appears from the evidence given at
the trial, one Cheely, a reporter on the Albertan, another Calgary
newspaper, was taken by

[Page 147]

the defendant to the Black Diamond Oil
Fields and was there imposed upon by a fraudulent demonstration and given false
information which led to his writing and publishing in the Albertan on
the 9th of May, an article containing a similar false statement.

Assuming both these statements to be within the purview of
section 414  of the Criminal Code , there is no room to doubt that the
defendant's concurrence in the publication of each of them constituted a
distinct crime or offence and that proof of conviction or acquittal after trial
on a charge in respect of one of them would not support a plea of autrefois
convict or autrefois acquit, as the case might be, to a like charge
in respect of the other.

The Cheely article was not before the Magistrate on the
preliminary investigation and no proof was made either of its contents or of
its publication. The only allusions in the evidence before the Magistrate to an
article in the Albertan were these incidental statements made by one of
the witnesses, Fletcher, which I copy from the factum filed on behalf of the
Crown:—

A. He said Tyron of the News-Telegram was taken out,
but they did not take the matter seriously and they had to get the Albertan and
he had got a good write up for them, but they had not obtained the monetary
results they expected.

Q. From the talking? A. From putting the oil in.

Q. Was there a big strike of oil there? A. According to the Albertan.

Q. The Albertan is a pretty reliable journal? A. They
are when they get reliable information.

Q. Were you present when the Albertan ever got any
information? A. No, sir.

Q. You don't know anything about it? A. I know Mr. Buck told
me he put (it?) over them; that is all I know; and could not over the News-Telegram.

Q. When did Mr. Buck tell you that? A. In Medicine Hat, on
the 12th of May.

Q. And where were you when he told you? A. I don't know
which street.

[Page 148]

Q. What day was the big strike? A. The 7th May was the
supposed strike.

It will be noticed that this evidence gives no date of
publication and, as the appellant's counsel said, it may refer to any one of
several articles commendatory of the company's undertaking which the evidence
shews appeared in the Albertan.

At the trial, counsel for the defendant objected to the admission
of evidence relating to the circumstances which led up to the publication of
the Cheely article of the 9th May, on the ground that the offence of having
concurred in that publication had not been the subject matter of any charge
before the Extradition Commissioner. In support of his objection he referred to
an affidavit of the Crown prosecutor in which he deposed that the Cheely
article had been called to his attention in September, 1916, and that a copy of
it was procured for him on the 4th October, 1916, which, he says, ""was the
first time I have ever seen the article in question in connection with the
charge herein."" The defendant's extradition had been ordered in July.

Counsel for the Crown met this objection by claiming the right to
prove a ""similar act"" as evidence having ""a bearing on the
offence for which he (the defendant) was extradited""; and it was in this
way, as ""additional evidence pertaining to the same charge""— no doubt
relevant on the question of intent—that the proof of publication of the Cheely
article and of the defendant's concurrence therein was admitted by the trial
judge.

Yet it was for his concurrence in the publication of the Cheely
article in the Albertan that the appellant has been convicted. The trial
judge so states, and counsel for the. Crown so admits. The learned judge had
already intimated that he considered that the

[Page 149]

charge, so far as it rested on the Tyron
article, had not been proved.

That, apart from evidence of identity and proof of the Canadian
law, the only evidence before the Extradition Commissioner was that taken on
the preliminary investigation before the Police Magistrate, is also distinctly
stated in the factum filed' on behalf of the Crown. The only charge under
section 414 of the Code investigated by the Police Magistrate, was concurrence
in the publication of the Tyron article in the News-Telegram, and it was
on that charge that extradition was ordered. The Cheely article was unknown to
the Crown prosecutor in connection with the charge against Buck, until long
after the preliminary investigation and extradition proceedings had been
concluded. It had not been proved before the Magistrate and consequently its
contents and publication were unknown to the Extradition Commissioner. It is
therefore impossible that he should have ordered extradition in respect of the
offence committed by the defendant in concurring in that publication. It is
only for the offence for which he was surrendered, and not for some other
offence, casually and imperfectly disclosed in the evidence which was before
the Commissioner, that the person surrendered can be lawfully tried and
convicted.

Because the conviction is contrary to the terms of the treaty and
contravenes section 32 of the ""Extradition Act ,"" I think it cannot be
sustained. I reach this conclusion somewhat less reluctantly, because I am not
altogether satisfied that persuading a reporter to publish in a newspaper an
untrue article such as those before us is an offence within section 414  of the
Criminal Code . This I understand to be the view expressed by Mr. Justice Stuart
at the conclusion of his judgment, probably sufficiently definitely to
constitute a

[Page 150]

ground of dissent of which the appellant
can take advantage in this Court.

The defendant is certainly not entitled to any sympathy. That he
committed a gross criminal fraud was overwhelmingly proved. He fully deserved
the term of imprisonment to which he was sentenced. But much as it is to be
regretted that such a scoundrel should escape punishment, it is of vastly
greater moment that the good faith of this country shall be scrupulously
maintained and a strict observance of its treaty obligations insisted upon.

For these reasons I would allow the appeal.

BRODEUR J. (dissenting)—The only point that we have
to examine on this appeal, is, whether the offence for which the appellant has
been extradited differs from the one for which he has been tried and convicted.

The appellant was a director of a company called Black Diamond
Oil Fields Ltd., a company formed for the purpose of extracting oil near
Calgary, in the Province of Alberta. The operations of the company were not as
successful as desired by the appellant, and the wells which were being opened
and made, did not produce the oil which was expected. The company was then in a
very serious financial embarassment; when in the month of May, 1914, the
appellant decided to put some oil in the well, which was being opened, and to
arrange to bring newspaper reporters who would, after having inspected the
well, publish statements shewing that oil had been struck.

He tried that at first with a Mr. Tyron, who was connected with
the News-Telegram of Calgary; but the publication was not made to the
satisfaction of the appellant.

Then he tried with another newspaper called the

[Page 151]

Albertan, and this time was successful. Mr. Cheely, the
reporter of that newspaper, was taken to the well in the automobile of the
appellant; the derrick was worked in his presence; oil was drawn from the well;
and a statement of the appellant that oil had been struck was published in that
newspaper, in an article written by Cheely.

A charge of fraud by a director was made under section 414  of the
Criminal Code , against Buck. He was committed to trial on that charge, and
among the witnesses examined at the preliminary examination, was a man by the
name of Fletcher, to whom the appellant admitted that he was responsible for
the statement which had been published in the Albertan.

The accused then fled to the United States and he was extradited
on the charge of having committed a fraud as a director and manager of a
company.

When the trial took place, the charge of fraud was proved mostly
by the evidence of Cheely, and by the statements which were made by Buck to the
latter.

It is claimed now that Cheely had never been mentioned in the
proceedings before the Extradition Commissioner, but that the statements which
were mentioned against him, though substantially the same, were made to some
other person.

The offence for which the appellant was extradited and convicted
was having concurred in the publication of a statement, that oil had been found
in the wells of the company of which Buck was a director. It is true that the
statement made to Cheely was not specifically mentioned in the proceedings
before the Extradition Commissioner; but the evidence of Fletcher, on which the
Extradition Commissioner passed judgment, shews conclusively that the appellant
concurred in the publication

[Page 152]

of the fraudulent statements of the Albertan.
The offence and the charge which were preferred against the appellant were
general in their character, and it seems to me that the Crown was perfectly
well justified in proving by different ways and by different circumstances how
the fraud was committed and what statements were published.

It was not then a question of a charge being different from the
one on which the extradition took place; it was the same offence and the same
charge which were considered in both cases, except that on the trial, the
evidence was more specific and was proved more efficiently.

I cannot say then, in those circumstances, that the appellant was
tried for a different offence, and I am of the opinion that he was rightly
convicted, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

Appeal allowed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF
SASKATCHEWAN.

Perjury—Evidence—Corroborative evidence—Criminal
Code , section 1002 .

The appellant was convicted of perjury for
swearing that ""he did not get from one Frank Brunner a cheque for four
thousand dollars."" Brunner swore that he gave the cheque in question to
the appellant and the only evidence relied on as corroborative of his was that
of one Smith, bank manager, who swore that he cashed the cheque for the
appellant.

Held, that the
evidence of Brunner was ""corroborated in some material particular * * *
implicating the accused,"" by the evidence of Smith, as required by section
1002  of the Criminal Code .

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Saskatchewan, rendered on a case reserved for the opinion of the Court by
the trial judge.

The facts on which the questions of law for
decision depend are sufficiently stated in the above headnote.

H. S. MacDonald K.C. for the appellant.

Sampson K.C. for the respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—The appellant was not charged with having,
when examined as a witness before the Commission appointed by the Legislative
Assembly, denied the receipt by him of a cheque for $4,000 signed by one
Brunner. The charge in the indictment is that Clayton Peterson swore he
""did not get from Frank Brunner a cheque for four thousand

[Page 116]

dollars."" Examined as a witness at the
trial, the appellant maintained his position. Brunner, on the other hand, swore
that he did give the accused the cheque. In these circumstances, one Smith, a
bank manager, was examined to prove that he cashed for Peterson a cheque of
Brunner for $4,000. That evidence was clearly admissible to prove the
possession by Peterson of the cheque in question, which was a fact tending to
corroborate in a material particular the actual delivery of the cheque by
Brunner to Peterson and that is the gravamen of the perjury charge.
Corroboration may result from any evidence which tends to give certainty to the
contention in support of which it is advanced. Although the fact that A. is
found in possession of B's cheque may not be absolute corroboration of the
statement that B. gave A. the cheque, that possession being consistent with the
possession obtained otherwise than through B., considered in connection with
all the other evidence, the fact of possession may help the jury to come to a
conclusion as to the truth or falsity of the statement. I am disposed to think
that, although the judge's charge might have been more explicit, the jury could
reasonably come to the conclusion they reached and there was no mistrial.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

Davies J.—The sole question in this criminal appeal is whether the evidence
of Frank Brunner, who testified that he had given to the appellant a cheque for
$4,000 for or upon account of the Licensed Victuallers Association, was

corroborated in some material particular by
evidence implicating the accused

as required by section 1002  of the Criminal
Code .

[Page 117]

The case reserved for the opinion of the court
by the trial judge states that

The accused was convicted of perjury for
swearing that ""he did not get from Frank Brunner a cheque for four
thousand dollars upon the Licensed Victuallers Association.""

Brunner swore that he gave the cheque in
question to the accused. The only corroborative evidence was that of Smith, the
manager of the Bank of Ottawa, who swore that he cashed the cheque for
Peterson.

The cheque in question was not Brunner's
cheque, but the cheque of the Licensed Victuallers Association, and was signed
by Brunner, as treasurer, and one Wilson, the secretary of that Association.
Under these circumstances, is the fact that Peterson had this cheque in his
possession corroborative evidence that it was given to him by Brunner?

A majority of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan
held that it was, and I agree with them.

In his evidence, Peterson testified, not only
that he did not get the $4,000 cheque from Brunner, but that he did not get
such a cheque at all or any money, except about $200.

I agree with Chief Justice Haultain that this
clear and unequivocal statement by Peterson excludes the theory or inference
advanced in argument that he might have got the cheque from some one else than
Brunner.

This being so, Smith the bank manager's evidence
must be held to be corroborative of Brunner's statement that he gave the cheque
in question to Peterson.

Smith swears he received the $4,000 cheque of
the Licensed Victuallers Association from Peterson on the 13th December, 1913
(the day Brunner says he gave it to Peterson), and cashed it for him.

I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

Idington J.—I am of the opinion that the evidence of Brunner that he gave
appellant the cheque in question was, in the language of section 1002  of the
Criminal Code , ""corroborated in some material particular

[Page 118]

* * * implicating the accused"" by the
evidence of Smith, the manager of the bank, that on the same day on which the
cheque was dated and alleged to have been given, the appellant was in
possession thereof and that it was cashed by him.

I therefore think the appeal should be
dismissed.

Duff J.—The question presented by this appeal as argued before us is
really an academic question, because the argument very largely proceeded upon
an abstract from the facts, not by any means presenting the full force of the
case made by the Crown. The facts I am about to state in themselves shew the
contention of the appellant to be beyond the pale of argument.

At a meeting of the executive committee of the
Licensed Victuallers' Association in Regina, it was arranged that the appellant
Peterson was to use money in connection with the Association's opposition to a
bill then before the legislature of Saskatchewan, and the appellant and one
Brunner, who was the treasurer of the Association, were authorized to employ the
funds of the Association for that purpose. The occurrences at this meeting were
proved by the evidence of the witness, George Sharpe. Brunner's evidence is
explicit to the effect that on December 13th, 1913, he gave Peterson a cheque
for $4,000, a cheque of the Licensed Victuallers' Association, signed by
Brunner as treasurer, and by another officer of the Association; and Smith, the
bank manager, proves by his evidence that on the same day a cheque answering
the description of that which Brunner says he gave the appellant was cashed by
the appellant. The evidence of the appellant, upon which the charge is based,
was to the effect that he ""did not get from Frank Brunner a cheque for
$4,000 upon the account of the Licensed Victuallers' Association.""

[Page 119]

The ground of appeal is alleged non-compliance
with the condition of section 1002  of the Criminal Code , which prescribes that
upon a charge of perjury, the accused shall not be convicted on the evidence of
one witness

unless such witness is corroborated in some
material particular by evidence implicating the accused.

It appears to me, as I have already said, that
in view of the evidence of Sharp and Smith the contention is not seriously
arguable. The principle to be applied is stated by Mr. Justice Wightman in Reg.
v. Boyes[1],
at p. 320.

It is not necessary that there should be
corroborative evidence as to the very fact, it is enough that there should be
such as would confirm the jury in the belief that the accomplice is speaking
the truth.

In the circumstances mentioned, Brunner's
official position as treasurer of the Association, the authority given by the
Association to Peterson and Brunner jointly to employ the funds of the
Association, the fact relied upon as corroborative evidence that on the very day
on which Brunner says he gave the cheque to Peterson, Peterson had such a
cheque and cashed it affords, it appears to me, superabundant corroboration
within the requirements of section 1002 .

Anglin J.—The question on this appeal is whether there was any evidence
proper to be submitted to a jury as corroboration of the testimony of Frank
Brunner that he had given to the appellant Peterson a cheque for $4,000 upon
the account of the Licensed Victuallers Association. Section 1002  of the
Criminal Code  prescribes that upon an accusation for perjury the accused shall
not

[Page 120]

be convicted upon the evidence of one
witness unless such witness is corroborated in some material particular by
evidence implicating the accused.

The appellant was charged with having committed
perjury in swearing that he

did not get from Frank Brunner a cheque for
$4,000 upon the account of the Licensed Victuallers Association.

The corroboration relied on by the Crown was the
testimony of Mr. Smith, manager of the Bank of Ottawa, that the appellant had
brought to his bank, on the same day on which Brunner swore that he had given
it to him, a cheque for $4,000 on the account of the Licensed Victuallers
Association, and that this cheque was cashed and its proceeds handed to the
appellant. In my opinion, the facts deposed to by Smith, that on the very day
on which Brunner swore he had given Peterson the cheque, the latter was in
possession of it and cashed it, was evidence implicating the accused, which the
learned trial judge could not properly have withdrawn from the jury as
corroborative in material particulars of the testimony of Brunner, within the
meaning of section 1002 of the Code. The weight to be attached to it was, of
course, entirely for the jury to determine. But that it might confirm the jury
in the belief that Brunner was speaking the truth, seems to me not to admit of
question; Reg. v. Boyes[2]; Rex. v. Daun[3]; Rex v. Scheller[4]; Radford v. Macdonald[5].

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Counselling to commit offence—Criminal
common law of England—Criminal Code , ss. 69 , 161 .

Every one is guilty of an offence who
counsels another to commit it, whether the person so counselled actually
commits the offence or not.

Demanding money from a contractor for aid in
securing contracts from a municipal corporation is counselling the contractor
to commit the offence mentioned in sec. 161  of the Criminal Code .

The criminal common law of England is still
in force in Canada, except in so far as repealed, either expressly or by
implication.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side[1],
reversing the judgment of the Court of Sessions of the Peace, at Montreal. The
accused, appellant, was discharged before the trial court; and the respondent
prayed for a reserve case before the Court of King's Bench, appeal side which
was granted. The Court of Appeal reversed the Magistrate's decision and sent
the prisoner back for sentence.

The circumstances of the case and the
questions of law are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now
reported.

N. K. Laflamme K.C. for the appellant.

J. C. Walsh K.C. for the respondent.

[Page 23]

The Chief Justice.—I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.
The appellant was charged before the magistrate with having, he then being
Mayor of the Council of the Town of Sault au Récollet, demanded from Beaulieu
and Chagnon, two contractors with the municipality, the sum of $2,500, as a
consideration for his aid in procuring them new contracts from the municipality
and renewing others in process of execution.

We are asked to say whether, these facts being
admitted, they disclose a criminal offence.

I have no doubt that, as found by the majority
below, the charge as laid comes directly within the language of section 69 (d)
of the Code. In effect, that section provides that every one is party to and
guilty of an offence who counsels or procures any person to commit the offence.
I am of opinion that the word ""and"" in the first line is to be read
disjunctively. If the offence is committed then the accused is a party to it;
or, if the offence is not committed, then he who counsels is guilty of a substantive
offence. It was suggested, but I hope not seriously, that in demanding payment
the accused cannot be said to have counselled payment. I construe
""counsel"" used in collocation with ""procure"" to mean
""advise"" or ""recommend"" and the demand made in the admitted
circumstances means at least that.

In Rex v. Higgins[2], Lord Kenyon said:—

It is argued that a mere intent to commit
evil is not indictable; without an act done; but is there not an act done when
it is charged that the defendant solicited another to commit a felony? The
solicitation is an act.

Here the accused is charged with having actually
asked and demanded the money, which is by section

[Page 24]

69 made an offence in itself; and of that act
the accused admits he was guilty. To incite to commit a felony, when no felony
is committed, is generally a common law misdemeanour. The Queen v. Gregory[3]. See also Reg. v.
Ransford[4].

Further it is an indictable misdemeanour at
common law for any person in an official position corruptly to use the power of
his position by asking for a bribe, which is exactly this case, and there can
be no doubt in so far as this court is concerned that the criminal common law
of England is still in force in Canada, except in so far as repealed either
expressly or by mplication. The Union Colliery Company v. The Queen[5], at p. 87.

Complaint is made that on this construction the
accused is not informed specifically of the law under which he is being
proceeded against; but while the Code provides that with respect to certain
offences the accused is entitled to particulars, ss. 957 , 852  and 854  Criminal
Code , I am not aware of any provision which requires the prosecuting officer to
give notice to the accused that he is being proceeded against for the breach of
some particular section of the Code or for a common law offence.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

Davies J.—I think section 69  of the Criminal Code  clearly makes a person
who counsels or procures another to commit an offence, guilty of a specific
offence, whether the person so counselled actually commits the offence he is
counselled to commit or not It is the counselling or procuring which
constitutes the offence irrespective of the effect of such counselling

[Page 25]

or procuring and so in the case before us the
defendant, being at the time Mayor of the town, in soliciting money for his
assistance in endeavouring to procure municipal contracts for certain parties,
Beaulieu and Chagnon, brought himself within the provisions of this section.

I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

Idington J.—I am of the opinion that under section 69  of the Criminal Code ,
every one is party to and guilty of an offence who actually commits it or
counsels another to commit the offence, and that when the appellant offered
himself as a man to be bribed, he was suggesting and, in the ordinary meaning
of the word, counselling those to whom he offered to prostitute his office for
a price, and was guilty of the offence to be done.

I therefore think the Court of Appeal was right
in answering the second question in the way they did, and that the appeal
should be dismissed.

Duff J.—I agree with Mr. Justice Idington.

Anglin J.—The purport and intent of clause (d) of s. 69  of
the Criminal Code  in my opinion is to make it an offence to counsel any person
to commit an offence whether the actual commission of the latter offence does
or does not ensue. I entertain no doubt that the defendant in soliciting money
from Beaulieu and Chagnon as a consideration for his aid in procuring municipal
contracts for them counselled them to commit what would be an offence under s.
161 of the Code.

Appeal dismissed.

Criminal law—Indictment without preliminary
inquiry—Option— Speedy trial—Jurisdiction—Criminal Code , ss. 825 , 826 , 827 ,
828 , 873 .

A bill of indictment was preferred to the
grand jury against the appellant under sec. 873  of the Criminal Code , and a
true bill was found. The appellant was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. On the
day fixed for the trial, he moved to be allowed to elect for a speedy trial
under the provisions of Part XVIII. of the Criminal Code , and the presiding
judge, with the consent of the Crown prosecutor, granted the motion. The
appellant was subsequently arraigned in the Court of Sessions of the Peace and
found guilty.

Held (Idington
and Duff JJ. dissenting), that the judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace
had jurisdiction to try the offence.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, Appeal Side[1],
affirming the judgment of the Court of Sessions of the Peace, at Montreal.

The accused, appellant, was found guilty by
the trial judge, but he prayed for a case to be reserved for the Court of
Appeal.

The circumstances of the case and the
questions submitted on the reserved case stated by the trial judge for decision
by the Court of King's Bench, are stated, as follows, by Mr. Justice Cross, in
his reasons for judgment in the court appealed from.

(See Q.R. 26 K.B., at pp. 331 and 332.)

""The accused Giroux appeals against a
conviction

[Page 64]

of theft made against him by the judge of
Sessions upon a speedy trial.

""He had not been committed for trial by
a justice. The prosecution commenced by a bill of indictment preferred to the
grand jury by direction of a judge.

""He pleaded to the indictment and a day
was fixed for trial; but on the day so fixed, he elected to take a speedy
trial. Effect was given to his election and he was tried as above mentioned.

""The learned trial judge has reserved
for our decision the question whether the election of speedy trial could be
made or was valid, seeing that there had been no preliminary inquiry; that he
had pleaded to the indictment and had been afterwards admitted to bail until
this day fixed for his trial by a jury.""

N. K. Laflamme K.C. for the appellant

J. C. Walsh K.C. for the respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—An indictment for theft and receiving stolen
goods was found by the grand jury of the District of Montreal in April, 1915,
against the appellant. On that indictment, he was arraigned and filed his plea
of not guilty. The trial was fixed for a subsequent day, when the appellant,
before the trial commenced, moved for leave to make his option to be tried by
the Quarter Sessions under the provisions

[Page 65]

of section XVIII. of the Criminal Code . The
presiding judge with the consent of the Crown Prosecutor granted the motion and
gave the leave asked for; and, on the same day—May 17th, 1915—the appellant
entered into a recognizance before a judge of the Sessions ""to appear in
person at the Court of the Sessions of the Peace on the 27th May then
instant,"" to answer to the charge of theft for which he had been indicted.

After much inexplicable delay the appellant was
finally tried before the judge of the Sessions and found guilty of the offence
with which he was charged.. At his request, two questions were reserved for the
consideration of the Court of Appeal.

On the application of appellant's counsel, that
court also examined into the sufficiency of the evidence to support the
conviction. In the result, all the questions were answered adversely to the
pretensions of the appellant. Mr. Justice Carroll dissented from the answer of
the majority to the first question, which was to this effect: Could the
accused, Giroux, charged with the offence of larceny on an indictment preferred
by the Crown Attorney, with the written consent of the judge presiding at the
assizes, elect, in the circumstances which I have just detailed, to be tried
before the Sessions of the Peace under Part XVIII. of the Criminal Code ?

In the view which I take of the case, it will be
unnecessary for me to deal with the other questions and upon which there is no
dissent in the lower court.

As I have already said, the indictment found
against the appellant was preferred under the provisions of section 873  of the
Criminal Code . No information had been lodged with a magistrate, no preliminary

[Page 66]

investigation had been held and consequently
there were no depositions and no commitment for trial, and it is in consequence
argued on behalf of the appellant that the material necessary to enable him to
exercise his right to elect under the provisions of ss. 826, 827 and 828 of the
Code did not exist.

It is not necessary for me to express any
opinion as to whether the appellant could as of right, in the circumstances of
this case, exercise his right to elect; but I have no doubt whatever that the
leave given by the trial judge on the application of the appellant with the
consent of the Crown Prosecutor had for its effect to validate all the
subsequent proceedings before the judge of the Sessions. I do not say that the
consent of the appellant conferred jurisdiction on the judge of the Sessions
but the latter had jurisdiction of the subject matter and in that respect was
not dependent upon the appellant's consent. The consent is only important in
this aspect of the case. It may be that by pleading to the indictment the
appellant chose his forum and acquired the privilege to be tried by a jury. But
by his application for leave to be tried by the judge of the Sessions he waived
this privilege and selected another forum which he had a perfect right to do
with the consent of the prosecuting officer.

The new forum had, as I have already said,
complete jurisdiction to try the offence with which the appellant was charged
and it is equally certain that he not only appeared voluntarily before the
judge of the Sessions to answer the charge but at the trial he with the
assistance of counsel cross-examined the Crown witnesses and examined witnesses
on his own behalf. The only possible objection to the proceedings before the
Sessions Court is that a bill of indictment

[Page 67]

had been already found against him at the
Assizes for the same offence as that for which he was tried in the Court of
Sessions and that indictment remains undisposed of.

But the trial on that indictment was suspended
on appellant's own request, and his conviction before the judge of the Sessions
and the sentence would be a complete bar to any further proceedings on the
indictment. As Graham J. said in Re Walsh[10],
at p. 19: ""The case of Reg. v. Burke[11],
shews what becomes of the indictment."" In my opinion the proper course
would be to move to have it quashed.

To sum up. Both courts had jurisdiction to try
the offence. Assuming that the prisoner had by his plea to the indictment
selected his forum and acquired the right to be tried by a jury, it was open to
him to waive that choice and he was also free to forego the privilege of a
trial by a jury. Consent cannot confer jurisdiction but a privilege defeating
jurisdiction may always be waived if the trial court has jurisdiction over the
subject matter.

I venture to say that to set aside the
proceedings below would in the circumstances of this case amount to a travesty
of justice. I have carefully read the cases referred to in the factum and at
the argument and when considered with reference to the particular facts with
which in each case the judges were dealing, I do not find that they give us
much assistance.

In the Burke Case (2), the defendants had
elected to be tried by the County Court Judge under the ""Speedy Trials
Act"" and indictments were subsequently found against them at the assizes
for the offences for which they had so elected to be tried.

[Page 68]

The question at issue was whether they could be
deprived of their right to be tried by the County Court Judge and it was there
decided that the right to elect to have a speedy trial was a statutory right of
which the defendants could not be deprived if they were in a position to avail
themselves of it.

In The King v. Sovereen[12], the prisoner argued
that a person out on bail is entitled to elect to be tried by a judge without a
jury after an indictment is returned founded on the facts disclosed by the
depositions taken at the preliminary inquiry and it was held that he is not
entitled as of right upon bill found and arraignment thereon to elect to be
tried without a jury. The prisoner was in that case committed for trial by a
magistrate and the indictment on which he was committed was preferred as in
this case by the Crown Prosecutor with the written consent of the trial judge.
It is only in this last respect that the cases are analogous.

It is not necessary to say more than this that I
agree with the opinions expressed in The King v. Sovereen12
by Chief Justice Moss and Mr. Justice Magee. The prisoner in that case claimed
to be entitled to make his election as of right and as Magee J. said, he had
not put himself in a position to claim that right, not being in custody and not
having given notice to the sheriff. The Chief Justice, with whom Garrow J.A.
and Latchford J. concurred, said:—

I am unable to think that it was the
intention to give an accused person the general right to elect to be
tried without a jury.

In Re Walsh[13],
it was held:—

A person sent up for trial for an
indictable offence and against whom while out on bail a true bill is found is
entitled on being taken into custody to elect for a trial without a jury.

[Page 69]

In this case, the appellant, with the consent of
the Crown Prosecutor and the approval of the judge, waived his right to be
tried by a jury at the Assizes and then voluntarily appeared before a court
having jurisdiction over the offence with which he was charged. He was then put
upon his trial for the offence for which he had been indicted; he was assisted
by counsel, examined and cross-examined witnesses and now seeks after he has
been found guilty to escape the consequences of his own free choice. I fail to
understand how ss. 826  et seq. have any application to the facts of this
case.

I am of the opinion that this appeal must be
dismissed.

Davies J.—I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.

Idington J. (dissenting).—The learned judge who presided at the March term of
the King's Bench, Crown Side, for the District of Montreal, duly directed,
pursuant to section 873  of the Criminal Code , an indictment for theft and
receiving stolen goods knowing them to have been stolen to be presented to the
grand jury against the appellant.

Thereupon the grand jury found a true bill upon
which the appellant was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the said
indictment, on the 25th April, 1915, when the trial was duly fixed for the 17th
May following.

He had never been prosecuted before any Justice
of the Peace in respect of the said offence or committed by any such Justice of
the Peace to stand his trial. The preferring of the indictment to and return of
a true bill by the grand jury followed by appellant's arraignment, his plea
thereto and appointment of a

[Page 70]

day for trial of that issue comprised all that
took place.

In short there was not the slightest semblance
of any such proceedings having been had as to lay the foundation for such a
proceeding as contemplated, by the speedy trial provisions of the Criminal
Code , to be necessary to give jurisdiction for the exercise of any of the
rights, duties or powers furnished thereby.

Yet on the day fixed for his trial, when
presumably everything was ready therefor, instead of its taking place he asked
to be allowed to elect to be tried by a judge under the said speedy trial
provisions. Without any jurisdiction to do so on the part of the presiding
judge, or vestige of authority on the part of the Crown officer, each
seems to have graciously assented to this novel proposition for the disposal of
an indictment, found by the grand jury in a higher court, being transferred to
a lower court, on the part of one who had (as expressed by the late Mr. Justice
Würtele in regard to a man before him in the like plight), conclusively and
exclusively elected to be tried in due course according to law by a jury.

Doubtless this assent was inadvertently given
without reference to the express terms of the Criminal Code  providing for the
manner of trial of any one indicted before and presented by a grand jury, as
having been truly so indicted.

It is stated in appellant's factum that on the
same day he went before Mr. Justice Bazin and made his option for a speedy
trial in the Court of Special Sessions of the Peace.

The case before us, however, only shews that on
the 17th May, 1915, the accused appeared before Adolphe Bazin, Esquire, judge
of the Sessions of the Peace for Montreal, and entered with a surety into a

[Page 71]

recognizance to appear on the 27th May at the
Court of General Sessions of the Peace in person to answer the indictment found
against him for theft and, so continue from day to day until discharged.

The first speedy trial provisions were enacted
in 1869, by 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 35, and confined to the Provinces of Ontario
and Quebec and with many
amendments later were extended to other provinces.

The purpose had in view was to enable those
committed for trial to avoid being kept in suspense for many months awaiting
the coming of a court with a jury, if they should choose to dispense with their
right to a jury trial.

Those innocent gladly availed themselves of such
an opportunity. Those guilty of some trifling offence which might be adequately
punished by a shorter term than they probably would serve, if unable to find
bail, were equally glad to avail themselves of the privilege. And even those
who could find bail were in very many cases likewise pleased to put an end, by
so electing, to the painful suspense they were enduring;

Such legislation furnished also a public gain,
in saving the time of jurors, both grand and petit at Assizes or Sessions.

In this peculiar case it is hard to find what
good cause was to be served by applying the speedy trial provisions of the Act,
for it was not until the 14th of the month of January following that the
appellant was actually put upon his trial and pleaded again ""not
guilty,"" before the district judge, when some witnesses were examined, and
the case was adjourned till the 20th Jan., when it was again adjourned till the
next day, only to be adjourned again till the

[Page 72]

1st February, and only after three more
adjournments ended by the judge finding him guilty.

Thereupon there was the special case reserved to
determine whether the judge ever had jurisdiction to take such proceedings.

The Act itself and the many amendments to it
gave rise in course of time to many cases, and reserved cases, relative to the
jurisdiction of the judge in the given circumstances of each such case. Hence
there were decisions of the higher courts or judges thereof in a great variety
of circumstances in the Provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, British
Columbia and Nova Scotia.

These decisions would not, of course, bind us if
an obvious misconception of the law had occurred in them all.

So far from there being diversity of opinion
there has been developed a uniformity of opinion relative to the main features
of the statute founding jurisdiction.

In not a single instance did it occur, till this
case, where an indictment of a grand jury duly found and pleaded to was,
notwithstanding the express provisions by the procedure sections of the
Criminal Code , attempted to be transferred to another and lower court for
trial.

In effect that is what was attempted here in
rather an off-hand fashion.

The case of Reg. v. Burke[14], shews how when the
accused had been improperly, in violation of his right to elect, indicted and
induced to plead to the indictment, he could free himself from such a
predicament.

Assuming the denial of legal right as was
assumed in that case, the proper course was adopted of quashing

[Page 73]

the indictment. Then the accused was free to
exercise his right.

No such phase is presented in this case. The
indictment and plea thereto still stands ready for trial as it was two years or
more ago.

Of the many cases I have referred to, presenting
the true situation of accused in such circumstances, I would refer to the
opinion of the late Mr. Justice Würtele in the case of The King v. Wener[15], wherein at page 413
he spoke as follows:—

The Criminal Code  does not prescribe that
an accused can elect to be tried without a jury when, without a preliminary
enquiry or without a committal or an admission to bail, and subsequent custody
for trial, a bill of indictment has been preferred by the Attorney-General or
by any one by his direction, or with the written consent of a judge of a court
of criminal jurisdiction, or by order of such court, and thus remove the
prosecution from the forum to which it properly belongs to another to which
jurisdiction has not in such case been given by law. In the absence of any
statutory provisions or statutory authority an accused has no right in such a
case to demand and obtain a trial in any other court than the one in which the
indictment was found, and which has jurisdiction over the case, and is seized
with it

And I would also refer to the opinion of the
late Sir Charles Moss, Chief Justice of Ontario, in the case of The King v.
Sovereen[16],
before the Court of Appeal for Ontario, so late as 1912, after all the
existing amendments had been made to the speedy trial provisions of the
Criminal Code . At p. 105 he spoke as follows:—

Speaking for myself, and with the utmost
respect for those who have indicated or expressed a different view, I think
that where, as here, a person committed for trial, and whether in custody or
upon bail, has not, before a bill of indictment has been found against him by a
grand jury, taken the steps necessary to enable him to elect to be tried by a
judge without a jury, he is not, upon bill found and arraignment thereon,
entitled as of right to ask to be allowed to elect to be tried without a jury.
If that is not the effect of the legislation, it places it in the power of the
accused not merely to postpone his trial, but to render futile all that has
been done by the grand jury, and necessitate

[Page 74]

a compliance with all the forms prescribed
by section 827 of the Code, including the preparation and preferring by the
prosecuting officer of a charge in accordance with the directions given in sec.
827 .

I am unable to think that it was the
intention to give an accused person the general right to elect to be tried
without a jury. On the contrary, I think that the intention was to give it only
in cases in which the exercise of such an election would or might effect a
speedy trial of an accused person, and thereby save the delay which waiting for
a trial by jury might involve.

I agree with these opinions. In either case
there was some basis for the accused to have elected had he chosen to do so
before plea.

In the case before us there never was the
semblance of any such basis. I conclude therefore that there was no
jurisdiction in the district judge to have accepted any such so called election
or to try the accused under such circumstances and the appeal should be allowed
accordingly.

There being no jurisdiction the second point
reserved falls to the ground and we have no right to answer the question
propounded upon the evidence.

Duff J. (dissenting) .—I concur with Mr. Justice Idington.

Anglin J.—Upon a bill preferred by Crown counsel with the consent of the
presiding judge under s. 873 (1)  of the Criminal Code , the grand jury, at a
sittings of the Court of King's Bench (Crown Side), held in Montreal, presented
an indictment charging the defendant with theft—an offence cognizable by the
Court of the Sessions of the Peace. Upon arraignment the defendant pleaded
""not guilty,"" and a subsequent date for his trial was thereupon fixed.
He was meantime released on bail on the date fixed he surrendered himself for
trial and then demanded that he be allowed to elect to be tried under Part
XVIII. of the Code by a judge of the Sessions of

[Page 75]

the Peace. Counsel for the Crown consented and
an order was made granting the demand. He accordingly appeared on the same day
before Bazin J. and made his formal election for speedy trial. He was
afterwards tried and convicted by Choquet J., presiding at a special sittings
of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace. He thereupon sought, and in view of
the decisions in The King v. Sovereen[17], and some other cases,
quite properly was accorded a reserved case for the decision of the Court of
King's Bench upon the question (submitted in the form of two questions),
whether, under the circumstances stated, his election for trial under Part
XVIII. of the Code was valid and sufficient to give the judge of the Court of
Sessions jurisdiction to try him. I deal with the question so reserved, to
which, as I understand it, the special jurisdiction conferred on this court by
section 1024  of the Criminal Code  is restricted.

Under section 825 of the Code, every person
committed for trial for an offence within the jurisdiction of the general or
Quarter Sessions of the Peace may, with his consent, be tried under Part XVIII.
A person in custody awaiting trial, however he may so find himself, is under
s.s. 4 to ""be deemed to be committed for trial within the meaning of the
section."" The defendant, in my opinion, was ""in custody awaiting
trial"" on the charge, when he had surrendered himself for trial on the
appointed date. Re Walsh[18];
The King v. Thompson[19].
I read ""the charge"" as meaning the charge mentioned in s.s. (1),
i.e., a charge cognizable by the Court of Sessions. The interests of justice
are protected, as far as Parliament considered such

[Page 76]

protection necessary, by the provision of s.s. 5
that, where the offence charged is punishable with imprisonment exceeding a
period of five years, the Attorney-General may require a trial by jury.

I see nothing in any provision of the Code, as
it now stands, which precludes an election for trial under Part XVIII. by an
accused under indictment, no matter how or when presented, if he comes within
the comprehensive terms of section 825 . The difficulty which formerly existed
owing to the supposed impossibility of complying with section 827  in the
absence of depositions taken upon a magistrate's preliminary investigation in
cases where such investigation had been waived and the accused had consented to
be committed for trial without it, was overcome by the insertion of the words
""if any"" in s. 827  by 8 & 9 Ed. VII., c. 9, s. 2. Any similar
difficulty in cases of indictments, preferred under the section now numbered
873 was thus likewise removed.

It is contended that the special provision made
by s. 828  for re-election after indictment by a person who had already elected
for trial by jury imports an intention to preclude the right of election in
other cases after indictment. But the raison d'être of this provision
was not to provide for the case of an indictment having been found, but to
confer or make clear the right to a second election. . Its terms, however,
pointedly indicate that the presentment of an indictment was not regarded by
Parliament as a bar to the right of election. No good reason can be suggested
why, if the man who has already elected for a jury trial should be allowed to
re-elect after indictment and up to the moment when his actual trial begins,
the man who has never elected should be debarred from doing so by the
presentment of an indictment.

[Page 77]

As Mr. Justice (afterwards Chief Justice) Graham
said in Re Walsh[20]:—

When Parliament did draw the line of
exercising the option as it does in sec. 828 , sub-sec. 2 (the re-election
provision), it provided that he (the accused) may exercise ""the election
at any time before such trial (i.e., before a jury) has commenced.""

I agree with the views expressed upon this point
by the learned judges of the Nova Scotia Appellate Court in Re Walsh20
and by Howell C.J.A. in The King v. Thompson[21].

But it may be said that after plea to the
indictment, at all events, the right of election is irrevocably gone for two
reasons: that the plea is an election of forum; and that upon arraignment the trial
has already commenced. Neither reason in my opinion is sound.

Assuming that the plea should be regarded as an
election of and submission to the forum of the Court of King's Bench and a jury
trial, it was the first and only election made by the accused and by s. 828 
express provision is made for a re-election by a prisoner who has elected to be
tried by jury ""at any time before such trial has commenced."" That the
arraignment is not part of the trial—that the trial only begins after plea—appears
from the heading ""Arraignment and Trial"" (s. 940) in the Code itself
and is established by many authorities collected in the judgment of Graham.
E.J. in Re Walsh20, at p. 17. Parliament has therefore in
explicit terms provided for an election after plea, since plea precedes the
commencement of the trial. The reasoning of Mr. Justice Graham and Mr. Justice
Ritchie in support of the right of election after indictment seems to me
conclusive in a case such as that before us. If Parliament, which, in enacting

[Page 78]

s. 828 , had election after indictment brought
expressly to its attention, did not mean that that right should exist where an
indictment is preferred under s. 873 , notwithstanding the comprehensive terms
in which secs. 825 and 828 are couched, I think it certainly would have said so
by an explicit exception. In the case of re-election, whatever the offence and
however punishable, by the proviso to sec. 828  after indictment the consent in
writing of the prosecuting officer acting under s.s. 2 of s. 826  is required,
and in any case either the judge or the prosecuting officer may prevent effect
being given to a second election (s.s. 3). The requisite consent of the
prosecuting officer was given here.

With great respect for the learned judges who
hold the contrary view, in my opinion, the fact that the indictment under which
the accused was awaiting trial had been preferred under s. 873 (1) of the Code,
did not prevent his exercising the right of election either under s. 825  or s.
828  and the judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace therefore had
jurisdiction to try him.

The tendency of the courts in the earlier cases
to place a narrow construction upon the ""Speedy Trials"" provisions of
the Criminal Code  has been adverted to in the Thomson Case[22] and Walsh Case[23]. It should probably be
attributed to the view strongly held by many, lawyers as well as laymen, that
trial by jury, especially in criminal cases, should be preserved intact. But
Parliament by one amendment after another has overcome the several restrictions
that judges have from time to time sought to place upon the right to elect for
trial before a judge of the Court of Sessions,

[Page 79]

thus evincing its policy and determination that
this mode of trial shall, as far as possible, be available within the limits
and subject to the safeguards which it has prescribed, and its desire that the
sections of the Code providing for it should receive a liberal rather than a
narrow construction.

Upon another question, as to the sufficiency of
the evidence, which the Court of King's Bench allowed the defendant to raise,
there was no dissent in that court and there is therefore no right to appeal
here.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Constitution of grand jury—Bias—Presentment
of true bill—Presence of accuser on grand jury—Prejudice—Criminal Code , s. 899 —Evidence.

The appellant was indicted for perjury. The
complainant had been summoned to act as a grand juror for the assizes at which
the trial took place. The complainant was present with the grand jury when it
was charged and when the presentment of a true bill was made. While the bill
was under consideration by the grand jury one of the jurymen to whom the
complainant had stated that it was a deplorable case, but it had come to the
pass that either he or the accused would have to leave the town, repeated this
statement to other grand jurors. In the reserved case it was stated by the
trial judge that the complainant had in no manner taken any part in the
deliberations of the grand jury on the indictment.

Held, affirming
the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 25 K.B. 275), Anglin and Brodeur JJ. dissenting,
that, in the circumstances stated in the reserved case, neither the fact of the
presence of the complainant as a member of the grand jury nor the statement
made by him constituted a well-founded objection to the constitution of the
grand jury which had passed upon the indictment which therefore could not be
quashed under the provisions of section 899  of the Criminal Code .

Per Davies,
Anglin and Brodeur JJ.:—An indictment preferred after consideration in which a
grand juror disqualified by interest had participated should be quashed. Rex
v. Hayes (9 Can. Crim. Cas. 101) disapproved.

Per Anglin and
Brodeur JJ.:—The reasonable inference from the facts stated in the special case
is that the complainant was present with the grand jury during their
deliberation upon the bill against the accused. The statement made by the
complainant

[Page 8]

to the juryman B., and by him repeated to his
fellow-jurymen, was calculated to influence them. It is impossible to know
whether the complainant's presence and his statement, so repeated, did or did
not affect the grand jury adversely to the accused. He is entitled to have it
assumed that they did. He Was thereby deprived of his right to have his case
passed upon by a duly qualified grand jury which was not improperly biased, and
he thereby suffered prejudice within section 899  of the Criminal Code  which
warrants the quashing of the indictment. Reg. v. Justices of
Hertfordshire (6 Q.B. 753); The Queen v. Inhabitants of Upton St.
Leonards (10 Q.B. 827); The Queen v. Gorbet et al. (1 P.E.I.
Rep. 262), and Reg. v. McGuire (4 Can. Crim. Cas. 12) referred
to.

Per Anglin
J.—On a motion to quash an indictment found by a grand jury it is improper to
admit evidence of what took place in the grand jury-room during the inquiry in
regard to the indictment. Reg. v. Justices of Hertfordshire (6
Q.B. 753); Rex v. Lancashire Justices (75 L.J.K.B. 198); Reg. v.
Meyer (1 Q.B. 173) and Reg. v. London County Council ((1892)
1 Q.B. 190) referred to.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, Appeal Side[1],
dismissing a motion to quash an indictment on the charge of perjury against the
appellant, whereon he had been convicted at the trial before Mr. Justice
Globensky and a jury, at Sherbrooke, in the district of Saint Francis, Quebec.

The circumstances of the case and the
questions submitted on the reserved case stated by the trial judge for decision
by the Court of King's Bench, are stated, as follows, by Mr. Justice Cross, in
his reasons for judgment in the court appealed from. (See Q.R. 25 K.B. at pp.
279 et seq.).

The appellant (Moise Veronneau) was found
guilty in the Crown side of this court, in the District of ""St. Francis,
in October, 1915, by verdict of a jury on a charge of having committed perjury.

""He appeals against the verdict, first,
on the ground that the indictment should have been quashed because of bias on
the part of one of the grand jurors

[Page 9]

who found the indictment, and, secondly, on
the ground that the trial judge allowed an amendment to be made to the
indictment of such a nature as was not permissible in law and allowed it to be
made at too late a stage of the trial.

""The learned judge who presided at the
trial has stated a case for our opinion on these points, and it appears from
the statement that the charge against the appellant was laid by one Denis S.
Bachand and that it was set forth in it that the alleged perjury had been
committed at a preliminary inquiry held by the district magistrate into a
charge made by the appellant against Bachand of having attempted to murder him
(Veronneau).

""It also appears that Bachand was one of
the grand jurors to whom the bills of indictment were submitted at the October
term.

""A true bill for perjury having been
returned, and Bachand being one of the jurors present at the return, the
appellant, before pleading, moved to quash the indictment on the ground that
Bachand was one of the grand jurors who had found the indictment and had said
to Brault, another juror (who had repeated them at the sitting of the jurors)
the words: 'C'est de valeur ce procès-la, mais au point où on est rendu la, il
va falloir que moi ou Veronneau parte de Coaticook.'

""It further appears from the stated case
that Bachand did not take part in the deliberations of the grand jury on the
case against the appellant; that the words above quoted were uttered to Brault
and by him repeated to the other jurors, but that it was not shewn that these
words influenced the jurors or affected their decision. The motion to quash was
dismissed.

[Page 10]

It further appears that, upon the trial being
proceeded with, there was a variance between the charge as laid and the
evidence, in that the perjury was charged to have been committed on October 30,
1914, whereas the appellant's deposition taken before the magistrate, and tendered
in evidence at the jury trial, purported to have been taken on October 13,
1914. The appellant objected to production of the deposition as not being
relevant to the charge, but the objection was overruled and the deposition was
read.

""After all the evidence had been taken,
counsel for the appellant submitted that the evidence related to testimony
given on October 13, and that there was no evidence to support a charge of
perjury committed on October 30.

""Thereupon the prosecutor moved to amend
by substituting the word 'thirteenth' for the word 'thirtieth' wherever the
latter appeared in the indictment.

""The amendment was allowed, and, upon
being asked if he desired a postponement, counsel for the appellant declined to

""1. Did the fact of Denis S. Bachand

the grand jury lawfully find the indictment, Bachand not having taken part in

the constitution of the grand jury was not so affected as to prevent the
finding by them of a true bill on the indictment.

The Chief
Justice.—This is an appeal on a stated case.

In answer to the first question I would say the
grand jury was regularly constituted notwithstanding that Bachand, who was the
party complainant before the magistrate in this particular case, was sworn as a
member of it. A grand juror is not sworn like a petit juror to try and a true
deliverance make on the evidence submitted. His duty is to diligently inquire
and a true presentment make of all such matters and things as shall be given
him in charge or shall otherwise come to his knowledge. Until quite
recently grand jurors might make presentments of their own knowledge and
information without the intervention of any prosecutor or the examination of
any witnesses. Vide Report of Royal Commissioners on English Draft Code,
pages 32 and 33.

As to the proceedings before the grand jury, it
is part of the stated case that Bachand, whose name was on the back of the
indictment, was examined, but took no other part in the proceedings. In these
circumstances, Bachand was not a stranger in the jury room. His presence is
explained and accounted for by the fact that he was a witness before the grand
jury

[Page 12]

in this particular case. And, if Bachand took no
part in the proceedings, I do not think his mere physical presence somewhere
about could affect the result of the grand jurors' deliberations or constitute
an interference with the privacy of their proceedings. There is no impropriety
in some one or more proper persons being present with the grand jury during
their inquiries on bills of indictment: Reg, v. Hughes[2]. I have not overlooked Goby
v. Wetherill[3]. The
stated case might have been more explicit on this point, but when the judge
states the fact to be that Bachand

n'a aucunement pris part aux délibérations
qui eurent lieu au sujet du dit acte d'accusation.

I think he must be assumed to mean that he took
no part in the finding of the bill. It would have been wiser, however, for
Bachand to have left the room after giving his evidence and, as a matter of
ethics or propriety, he should not have been present in the box when the bill
was returned.

We must assume for the purposes of this appeal
that Bachand took no part, except as a witness, in the discussions or
deliberations on this indictment or in the finding of the true bill, and I
express no opinion as to whether if he had done so the indictment should have
been quashed.

I attach little importance to the observations
made to Brault who was also a grand juror.

Davies J.—This appeal is one from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench
(Appeal Side), Province of Quebec, refusing, by a majority, to quash an
indictment found against the appellant on the alleged ground that one of the
grand jury which found the indictment was interested and biased, having been
the prosecutor.

[Page 13]

I should say that if the facts proved had shewn
Bachand to have taken any part in the proceedings or in the consideration of
the bill found by the grand jury of which he was a member, as to which he was
interested or biased, that would have justified the appeal and the quashing of
the indictment.

The question is one of fact capable of being
proved by evidence. The finding of the learned trial judge before whom the
motion to quash was first made, that the proof established that Bachand did not
participate in the proceedings of the grand jury upon this particular bill or
in the consideration of the jury's finding of a true bill upon it, approved of
by the court of appeal, if sustained by the evidence, is sufficient to dismiss
the motion.

I am of opinion that the evidence to shew this
non-participation and non-interference was properly admissible and that it is
sufficient to uphold the findings of the courts below.

I cannot accede to the proposition that the fact
of one member of a grand jury being disqualified from interest or bias with
respect to one of the bills brought before that body for consideration, affects
the constitution of the grand jury generally.

Such a disqualified person cannot take any part
in the proceedings or findings of the jury with respect to the bill in which he
is interested, but such disqualification is a personal and limited one and does
not affect the constitution of the jury as a whole or the right of the juror so
partially disqualified from taking part in all the proceedings or findings of the
jury on other bills in which he has no interest or bias.

This question of the participation or
non-participation of Bachand in the proceedings of the grand jury upon this
bill, including their finding upon it,

[Page 14]

was the main and substantial question argued on
this appeal. There were other subsidiary questions mentioned with respect to
them. I do not think there was anything in them to justify this court in
interfering with the judgment appealed from.

Idington J.—The appellant was indicted for perjury and the learned trial
judge was moved to quash the indictment on the ground that the private
prosecutor was a member of the grand jury which returned the bill as true.

The learned trial judge investigated the matter
and dismissed the motion but reserved the point raised thereby together with
another which developed during the trial.

In his stated case separate questions were
asked. The court of appeal disposed, by their unanimous judgment, of the
second, leaving only that bearing upon the motion to quash in regard to which
in that court there were dissentient opinions which enabled the accused to
appeal here.

The first question, which thus comes before us,
was stated as follows:—

Première
Question.

Le fait que Denis S. Bachand avait été
assigné comme grand jure affectait-il la légalité de la constitution du grand
jury, et ce dernier pouvait-il légalement rapporter comme bien fondé, l'acte
d'accusation porté contre Véronneau, Bachand n'ayant aucunement pris part aux
délibérations qui eurent lieu au sujet du dit acte d'accusation, et la décision
de cette Cour renvoyant la motion de l'accusé, était-elle celle qui devait être
rendue?

The law applicable to the question raised before
the learned trial judge is stated in section 899  of the Criminal Code , as follows:—

899. No plea in abatement shall be allowed.

(2) Any objection to the constitution of
the grand jury may be taken by motion to the court, and the indictment shall be
quashed if

[Page 15]

the court is of opinion both that such
objection is well founded and that the accused has suffered or may suffer
prejudice thereby, but not otherwise.

The fact that the private prosecutor took no
part in the deliberations on the subject of the accusation seems to me
conclusive against this appeal. His having been summoned and sworn as a grand
juror seems to furnish no ground of objection. He was bound to obey the summons
and be sworn. It was not competent for him to refuse, for the very good reason
that the conduct of the matter lay in the hands of the Crown officer and might
not come before that grand jury or they might be directed by the learned trial
judge, under such circumstances, if he saw fit for good reasons to refrain
from dealing with it.

We are asked to presume, notwithstanding the
statement of fact contained in the question which is the boundary of any
appellate court's jurisdiction herein, that in fact the private prosecutor so
summoned as a grand juror did take part in the deliberations in question herein
as such grand juror.

In other words, we are asked to presume not only
against the stated fact but also against the presumption of law that he did so.

The presumption of law is that he did not and
that the Crown officer in charge saw to it as part of his duty, if aware of his
being a grand juror, that he was properly instructed in that regard either by
the foreman or the learned trial judge or himself, and that due order of law
was observed.

Possibly he was a witness and, as such, before
the grand jury for such length of time as the requirements of giving his evidence
or otherwise relative to the presentation of the evidence in accordance with
what convenience in the case might demand. Nothing

[Page 16]

further can be presumed as to the fact of his
presence there.

Then it is said he appeared with the grand jury when
its foreman presented the ""true bill"" in court.

Again there is no presumption to be drawn
therefrom. For aught we know he may merely have taken a seat in the places
assigned in the court-room for the grand jurors which he was entitled to do,
for many proper reasons. Other bills may, for example, have been returned by
the foreman to the court at the same time as this, or have been expected to
have been so presented.

The mere presentation by the grand jurors of a
bill forms no part of their deliberations and determination. That is disposed
of in the grand jurors' room and the finding there written is simply handed in
to the court. Often judges presiding at a busy court direct, as they may, that
the foreman alone or such number of jurors as directed may do so, without the
whole panel appearing.

And, assuming the worst that can be said of a
private prosecutor appearing under such circumstances, it is specially directed
by the final part of the statute I quote that unless the accused has suffered
prejudice thereby the indictment must not be quashed.

I cannot find anything deserving serious
consideration in all that has been urged by appellant's counsel to maintain
this appeal. To do so would, I submit, be a reversion to technicality which the
Criminal Code  and its predecessors did so much during last century to eliminate
from the law, in order that justice might be done.

I have assumed in favour of the decent
administration of justice, but am not to be taken as expressing any opinion,
that in law a convicted man is entitled

[Page 17]

to go free simply because his accuser formed one
of those grand jurors who presented his case for trial. I express no opinion on
that legal issue, nor shall I till need be.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Anglin J. (dissenting).—The defendant appeals to this court under sections
1013(3)  and 1024  of the Criminal Code  from the judgment, on a case reserved
under section 1014(2) , affirming the verdict and conviction recorded against
him on a charge of perjury. The opinion of the majority (Archambeault C.J.,
Lavergne and Cross JJ.) was delivered by Mr. Justice Cross. Carroll and
Pelletier JJ. dissented on only one of the reserved questions, viz., whether a
motion to quash the indictment had been properly rejected, which is therefore
the subject of the present appeal.

On the 3rd of November, 1914, one Bachand, who
had been unsuccessfully prosecuted at the instance of the defendant on a charge
of attempted murder, laid a complaint against the defendant of having committed
perjury in the course of that prosecution. The defendant having been committed
for trial, his case came before the Court of King's Bench, in October, 1915. At
this term of the court Bachand was a member of the grand jury. He was present
in the jury-box when the grand jury was charged with the consideration of the
indictment preferred against the defendant, and again when a true bill was
returned. Before the defendant pleaded to the indictment a motion was made on
his behalf that it should be quashed because of the presence of Bachand as a
member of the grand jury, and also because Bachand had said to one Brault, also
a grand juryman, the following words:—

[Page 18]

C'est de valeur ce procès là, mais au point
où on est rendu là, il va falloir que moi ou Verroneau parte de Coaticook,

which Brault had repeated to other members of
the grand jury, while they were assembled for deliberation.

In the reserved case the learned judge makes the
following statement:—

Avant adjudication sur cette motion, il fut
établi devant la cour qu'en effet Denis S. Bachand avait été assigné comme
grand juré pour le dit terme d'octobre, mais qu'il n'avait aucunement pris part
aux délibérations du grand jury sur 1'accusation portée contre Verroneau. Il
fut aussi établi que les paroles susdites avaient été dites par Bachand à
Brault et que ce dernier les avait rapportées dans la salle des délibérations
aux autres grands jurés; mais il n'a été aucunement établi que ces paroles
aient influencé ces derniers et qu'elles aient eu pour effet de déterminer leur
rapport.

Il est vrai que Bachand était dans la boîte
des grands jurés quand ceux-ci ont rapporté l'acte d'accusation comme bien
fondé contre l'accuse.

In the respondent's factum it is stated that the
fact that Bachand took no part in the deliberation upon this case

was proved by the affidavits of two
witnesses before the court.

These affidavits are not in the record and,
although their production has been demanded, are not forthcoming. In view of
the strict provisions as to the secrecy of all that transpires in the
jury-room, and the terms of the grand jurors' oath, I find it difficult to
understand how the learned judge was in a position to make the statement which
he does as to the abstention of Bachand from taking part in the deliberations
on this case. Rex v. Marsh[4],
at page 237; Rex v. Willmont[5];
Greenleaf on Evidence, par. 252; Taylor on Evidence, par. 943; Archbold,
Criminal Pleading (23 ed.), page 103; 4 Blackstone's Com. par. 126. I am
likewise at a loss to appreciate the force of the learned judge's observation:—

[Page 19]

Il n'a été aucunement établi que ces
paroles aient influencé ces derniers et qu'elles aient eu pour effet de
déterminer leur rapport.

As at present advised I incline to think that we
should ignore both the statement that Bachand took no part in the deliberations
upon the charge against Veronneau and also the statement that it was not
established that the repetition of what he had said to the juror Brault
influenced the grand jury.

But if we are bound by these statements made in
the special case, it should be pointed out that it does not appear (as indeed
it could not without impropriety, Taylor on Evidence, para. 943) whether the
bill against Veronneau was returned by the vote of more than seven members of
the grand jury; nor is there an explicit statement that Bachand did not vote
upon the bill as a grand juryman although he had refrained from taking part in
the deliberation. Bachand having been present in the jury-box when the jury was
charged with the consideration of the case against the defendant, and again
when the bill was returned, his presence in the jury-room while it was under
deliberation seems to be a reasonable inference which is in nowise negatived in
the case submitted.

The question reserved for the consideration of
the court is stated in the following terms:—

Le fait que Denis S. Bachand avait été
assigné comme grand juré affectait-il la légalité de la constitution du grand
jury, et ce dernier pouvait-il légalement rapporter comme bien fondé, l'acte
d'accusation porté contre Verroneau, Bachand n'ayant aucunement pris part aux
délibérations qui eurent lieu au sujet du dit acte d'accusation, et la décision
de cette Cour renvoyant la motion de l'accusé, était-elle celle qui devait être
rendue?

In answer to the appeal counsel for the Crown
takes the position that there is no right of challenge to a grand juryman
individually, that the remedy of an accused person in the case of a
disqualified grand juryman was, prior to the Criminal Code , by plea in

[Page 20]

abatement, that such pleas have been abolished
(Crim. Code, sec. 899), that a motion to quash in lieu thereof is permitted
only in the case of an ""objection to the constitution of the Grand
Jury"" (ibid.) and that an objection that a member of the
grand jury was not indifferent because of alleged interest is not an objection
to the constitution of the grand jury. The King v. Hayes[6]. His position, therefore, is that,
although it should be assumed that Bachand took part in the finding of the true
bill against Veronneau, and even that his vote was necessary to its return,
nevertheless Veronneau would be without redress because the law affords him no
remedy. In the alternative he maintains that, in view of the statements in the
reserved case, that Bachand had taken no part in the deliberation of the grand
jury, and that it was not proved that his conversation with Brault, though
repeated to the grand jury, had in fact affected them, the court cannot
properly hold, although the objection should be deemed well founded, that
""the accused has suffered or might suffer prejudice thereby.""

It seems unnecessary to consider the somewhat
debated question whether there is a right of challenge to the polls in the case
of a grand jury. I appreciate the force of the argument ab inconvenienti pressed
in the Sheridan Case[7], and
incline to the view that under the old practice an objection to a grand juryman
would be properly made when the accused was arraigned either by plea in
abatement or by motion to quash the indictment. I agree with Mr. Justice Cross
that either course would seem to have been open, the latter, however, being the
only method available when, as may often happen, the defendant first became
aware of the ground of objection after he had pleaded

[Page 21]

""not guilty."" Since the adoption of
the provision of the Criminal Code  abolishing all pleas in abatement the remedy
is by motion to quash.

I also agree with Cross J. that the view that
the phrase ""any objection to the constitution of the grand jury""
(Crim. Code, 899, sec. 2), covers only objections based on lack by jurors of
qualifications expressly prescribed by provincial statute law, or on
disqualification of the officer charged with the duty of selecting and
summoning the grand jury, seems to be too narrow. Anything which destroys the
competency of the grand jury as a whole or the competency of any of its
members, I think, affects the constitution of that body and affords a ground of
objection which may be raised by a motion to the court under section 899. A
grand juror may be well qualified as to all the cases on the docket save one
and wholly unfit to pass upon that one. As to that case the jury would not be
properly constituted while he sat upon it.

In the King v. Hayes[8], the contrary view was taken,
apparently based largely upon what, with respect, would appear to have been a
misconception of section 662  of the Criminal Code  then in force.

Every person qualified and summoned as a
grand or petit juror, according to the laws in force for the time being in any
Province of Canada, shall be duly qualified to serve as such juror in criminal
cases in that Province.

Apart from any question as to the constitutional
validity of this section as a provision dealing with the constitution of the
court rather than with criminal procedure, it should be noted that the
qualification which it declared sufficient was not merely that prescribed by
the provincial statute law, but qualification

according to the laws in force for the time
being in any Province of Canada.

[Page 22]

I know of no law in force in any province which
has taken away the common law right to object to a juror propter affectum or
deprived an accused in the Province of Quebec of the right, which exists, as in
Ontario and the other older provinces, before conviction for an indictable offence,
to have his case passed upon first by a body of impartial grand jurors and
afterwards by a petit jury likewise composed of indifferent men. 4 Blackstone's
Com. para. 306.

The disqualification of interest—propter
affectum—rests upon the common law maxim, ""that no man is to be a
judge in his own case,"" which, as Lord Campbell said in Dimes v. Grand
Junction Canal Co.[9],

it is of the last importance * * * should
be held sacred. And that is not to be confined to a cause in which he is a
party but applies to a cause in which he has an interest.

The presence of one interested justice on a
bench of magistrates renders the court improperly constituted and vitiates the
proceeding, although the majority, without reckoning his vote, favoured the
decision: Reg. v. Justices of Hertfordshire[10]. The same rule is applicable to a
grand jury. The Queen v. Inhabitants of Upton St. Leonards[11]. The case last cited is also particularly
in point because of the statement made by Bachand to Brault, and repeated to
the other grand jurors, which not only put Bachand's interest in the
prosecution beyond doubt, but was of a character

not unlikely to influence the grand jury in
their decision.

The reasoning and grounds of decision of Peters,
J., in The Queen v. Gorbet et al.[12], commend themselves to my judgment rather
than those which prevailed in the King v. Hayes[13].

[Page 23]

As already stated I am unable to agree with the
view taken by Mr. Justice Cross that evidence was legally received that the
juror Bachand, though apparently present in the grand jury room, did not
participate in the discussion of Veronneau's case. It would, in my opinion, be
a practice fraught with very grave dangers to enter upon any such inquiry. The
illegality of the presence of a mere stranger in a jury-room is illustrated by
the recent case of Goby v. Wetherill[14]. The presence of a person disqualified by
interest, himself a member of the body, must be still more objectionable.
Moreover, as already pointed out, the statement that Bachand did not take part
in the deliberations of the grand jury on the Veronneau case not only does not
negative his presence in the jury-room, but is not inconsistent with his having
voted on the finding. The true principle, however, is that upon which the
decisions in Reg. v. Justices of Hertfordshire[15], and Rex v. Lancashire
Justices[16], and Reg.
v. Meyer[17]
proceed. As Blackburn J. said, in the case last cited,

we cannot go into the question whether the
interested justice (juror) took no part in the matter (i.e., in the
discussion of the case).

See also for a different application of the same
principle, Reg. v. London County Council[18], at page 196. As to
the statement of Bachand to grand juror Brault, repeated by the latter
(probably in Bachand's presence) in the jury-room, it was of a character
calculated to influence other jurymen and it is impossible to know whether it
did or did not in fact influence them. Mr. Justice Cross was under the
erroneous impression that

[Page 24]

the learned trial judge had found that the
communication did not affect the decision of the grand jury.

All that the special case states is that:—

Il n'a été aucunement établi que ces paroles
aient influencé ces derniers et qu'elles aient eu pour effet de déterminer leur
rapport.

The effect of Bachand's statement upon the grand
jury is a field of inquiry not open to us. The statement was improperly before
them. It had all the weight of a communication from one of the body itself. The
defendant is entitled to have it assumed that it produced some effect.

The accused has been deprived of the substantial
right of having his case passed upon by a duly qualified and unbiased grand
jury, and it was, in my opinion, quite impossible when the motion to quash was
disposed of in the trial court to affirm that he had not suffered or might not
suffer prejudice thereby. Rex v. Willmont[19] ; Allen, v. The King[20]. To hold, as was apparently held by
one learned judge in the Hayes Case[21],
at page 118, that, because the appellant was subsequently convicted by a petit
jury at the trial, to which he was compelled to proceed upon the rejection of
his motion to quash, it cannot be said that he was really prejudiced by
anything which concerned the action of the grand jury, would entail a denial of
redress in any case after conviction, however gross the improprieties
accompanying the finding of the indictment, however prompt the action of the
defendant in taking exception thereto, and however erroneous the rejection of
his objections.

In my opinion, the motion to quash the
indictment should have been granted and the question submitted should be
answered accordingly.

[Page 25]

Brodeur J. (dissident).—Il s'agit
dans cette cause d'un appel de la décision de la Cour du Banc du Roi maintenant
l'acte d'accusation porté contre l'appelant.

L'appelant, Véronneau, et M. Denis S. Bachand sont
évidemment deux citoyens importants de la ville de Coaticook. L'un deux, en
effet, est un médecin et l'autre est un citoyen dont la fortune est assez
considérable pour être qualifié comme grand juré.

Ce sont deux ennemis invétérés et ils ont jugé à
propos de vider leur querelle devant les cours criminelles du pays.

Veronneau avait d'abord porté une accusation de
tentative de meurtre contre Bachand, mais après procès ce dernier fut acquitté.
A son tour, Bachand a porté une accusation contre Veronneau l'accusant de
s'être parjuré dans ce procès de tentative de meurtre.

Le magistrat chargé de l'enquête préliminaire a
trouvé matière à procès contre Véronneau sur l'accusation de parjure et un acte
d'accusation a été soumis au grand juré.

Coincidence assez
extraordinaire, nous trouvons que parmi les membres du grand jury se trouvait
être Bachand lui-même. Aussi quand l'acte d'accusation a été rapporté comme
bien fondé, Véronneau a fait motion pour le casser sur le principe que le jury
n'était pas legalement constituté, vu que parmi les jurés se trouvait être son propre accusateur.

Une preuve par affidavit a été faite à ce sujet et il paraît avoir été établi à la satisfaction
du juge qui présidait au procès que Bachand n'avait pas pris part aux
délibérations. Il ne nous dit pas cependant si Bachand était dans la chambre où
les jurés ont délibéré.

Il est en preuve également que Bachand aurait dit à
l'un de ses collègues du grand jury qu'au point où

[Page 26]

on étaient rendues les choses ""il va falloir
que lui ou Véronneau parte de Coaticook.""

Il a été prouvé également que Bachand était dans la
boîte des grands jurés quand ceux-ci ont rapporté l'acte
d'accusation comme bien fondé contre Veronneau.

La question qui se présente est donc de savoir si
le jury était validement constitué pour rapporter Pacte d'accusation en
question. Il n'y a pas de doute sur le fait que Bachand était membre du grand
jury et qu'il a été assermenté comme tel.

Le juge qui présidait au procès a réservé pour la
décision de la cour d'appel la question suivante:—

Le fait que Denis S. Bachand avait été assigné
comme grand juré affectait-il la légalité de la constitution du grand jury et
ce dernier pouvait-il légalement rapporter comme bien fondé l'acte d'accusation
porté contre Verroneau, Bachand n'ayant aucunement pris part aux délibérations
qui eurent lieu au sujet du dit acte d'accusation et la décision de cette cour
renvoyant la motion de l'accuse était-elle celle qui devait être rendue?

Les rôles d'accusateur et de juge sont, d'après les
principes primordiaux de notre organisation judiciaire, absolument
incompatibles; et la Couronne l'a si bien compris que dans la cause actuelle
elle a prouvé que l'accusateur, Bachand, n'avait pas pris part aux
délibérations qui ont eu lieu sur l'acte d'accusation porte contre Veronneau.

Les faits qui nous sont rapportés par le juge et
qui font la base de la question réservée ne sont peut-être pas aussi détaillés
qu'ils devraient l'être., Ainsi, par exemple, je crois qu'il aurait été bien
important de savoir si Bachand était resté ou non, pendant les délibérations du
jury. Le juge déclare simplement qu'il n'a pas pris part aux délibérations.
Cela veut-il dire qu'il n'était pas présent dans la chambre où le jury a
délibéré? J'étais enclin d'abord à croire que le fait de mentionner qu'il
n'avait pas pris part aux

[Page 27]

délibérations aurait pu être interprété comme
encluant sa présence mais qu'il n'avait pas assisté. Mais, réflexion faite, je considère que la meilleure interprétation qui
puisse être donnée à cette expression du juge est que Bachand était présent
mais qu'il n'a nullement pris part aux délibérations.

Je considère que dans les circonstances le jury
n'était pas légalement constitué pour porter un acte d'accusation.

Chitty dit:—

This necessity for the grand inquest to
consist of men free from all objection existed at common law and was affirmed
by the statute 11 Henry IV., ch. 9, which enacts that any indictment taken by a
jury, one of whom is unqualified shall be altogether void and of no effect
whatever. So that if a man be outlawed upon such a finding, he may, on evidence
that one of the jury was incompetent, procure the outlawry against him to be
reversed.

Le grand jury dans le cas actuel pouvait être légalement constitué pour entendre
d'autres causes qui lui seraient soumises; mais, en tant que la cause de
Veronneau est concernée, je considère qu'il n'était pas légalement constitué.

Je ne saurais, par conséquent, concourir dans
l'opinion exprimée dans la cause de Reg. v. Hayes[22]. Je crois que le
principe qui a été énoncé dans la cause de Reg. v. McGuire[23], est plus
acceptable et plus conforme à notre organisation judiciaire.

Pour ces raisons, je serais d'opinion que l'acte
d'accusation proféré contre Veronneau devrait être annulé et que l'appel
devrait être maintenu avec dépens.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA.

Criminal law—Indictment—Separate counts—Verdict—Conspiracy—Extraditable
offence—Inadmissible evidence—Conviction—Inconsistency—Irregularity of
procedure—Charge to jury—Address of counsel—Substantial wrong or miscarriage—New
trial—""Criminal Code ,"" s. 1019 —Penalty.

On an indictment containing several counts,
including charges for theft, receiving stolen property and obtaining money
under false pretences, in respect of which the person accused had been extradited
from the United States of America, evidence was admitted on behalf of the
Crown, for the purpose of shewing mens rea, which involved participation
of the accused in an alleged conspiracy. The principal objections urged against
a conviction upon the charges mentioned were (a) that by the
manner in which the trial had been conducted the jury may have been given the
impression that the accused was on trial for conspiracy, a non-extraditable
offence; (b) that misstatements and inflammatory observations had been
made by counsel for the Crown in addressing the jury; and (c) that, in
his charge, the trial judge had failed to correct impressions which may have
been thus made on the minds of the jury or to instruct them that portions of
the evidence admitted in regard to other counts ought not to be considered by
them in disposing of the charge of obtaining money under false pretences.

Held, that, as
there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict of the jury on the charge
of obtaining money under false pretences, quite apart from the irregularities
alleged to have taken place at the trial, no substantial wrong or miscarriage
had been occasioned and there could be no ground for setting aside the
conviction or directing a new trial under the provisions of section 1019  of the
Criminal Code .

Judgment appealed from (11 West. W.R. 46),
affirmed.

[Page 221]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Manitoba[1], upon a
reserved case submitted by Mr. Justice Prendergast, the presiding judge at the
trial of the appellant who was convicted upon four of the counts of the
indictment preferred against him.

The accused was tried on five counts of an
indictment, in substance as follows: (1) Theft of money, valuable securities
and other property, belonging to the King, in the right of the Province of
Manitoba; (2) unlawfully receiving money, valuable securities or other property
belonging to the King which had been embezzled, stolen or fraudulently obtained
by means of a conspiracy between the accused and others to defraud the King,
the accused then knowing the same to have been so embezzled, etc., by means of
said conspiracy; (3) a count similar to the second count, but naming two
additional co-conspirators; (4) obtaining moneys by false pretences from His
Majesty for the accused and others; (5) unlawfully receiving moneys of His
Majesty which had to the knowledge of the accused been obtained by false
pretences with intent to defraud.

The jury acquitted the accused on the third
count, but brought in a verdict of guilty on all the others.

The issues raised on the present appeal are
stated in the judgments now reported.

The questions reserved for consideration by
the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, with the answers ordered to be returned
thereto by that court were as follows:—

""1. Was I right in refusing to quash the
whole indictment on the motion of counsel for the accused upon the grounds
urged by them in their argument before me? A. Yes.

[Page 222]

""2. Was I right in refusing to
quash the first count in the indictment upon the motion of counsel for the
accused upon the grounds urged by them in their argument before me? A. Yes.

""3. Was I right in refusing to quash the
second count in the indictment upon the motion of counsel for accused upon the
grounds urged by them in their argument before me? A. Yes.

""4. Was I right in refusing to quash the
fourth count in the indictment upon the motion of counsel for the accused upon
the grounds urged by them in their argument before me? A. Yes.

""5. Was I. right in refusing to quash
the fifth count in the indictment upon the motion of counsel for the accused
upon the grounds urged by them in their argument before me? A. No.

""6. If any of the said counts should
have been quashed or otherwise dealt with by me, either before or during the
trial, has there been a mis-trial of the accused on any other count or counts
by reason of the admission of evidence upon such count or counts as should have
been quashed or otherwise dealt with by me? A. No.

""7. Was I right in my charge to the jury
on the first count of the indictment as to theft or was my charge insufficient
in law so as to be prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused? A. To the first
part of question preceding the word 'or'—Yes; to remainder of question—No.

""8."" Was I right in my charge to the
jury on the fourth count of the indictment as to what constituted the offence
of obtaining money by false pretences or was my charge insufficient in law so
as to be prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused? A. To first part of
question preceding the word 'or'—Yes; to remainder of question—No.

[Page 223]

""9. Was I right in admitting evidence as
to acts, conduct, admissions, conversations and facts relating to some one or
more of those named in the second count, namely: Rodmond P. Roblin, Walter H.
Montague (since deceased), James H. Howden, George R. Coldwell, R. M. Simpson
and Victor W. Horwood, to which the accused was not a party, and, if I have
erred, was the same prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused? A. To first
part of question down to and including the word 'party'—Yes; to remainder of
question—No.

""10. Was there evidence upon which a
jury could properly convict the accused—(a) On count Number 1; (b)
On count Number 2; (c) On count Number 4; (d) On count Number 5.
A. Yes.

""11. The jury having found the accused
Thomas Kelly not guilty on the third count in the indictment, and evidence
having been admitted on said count upon the trial, was the admission of such
evidence prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused on the remaining four
counts in the indictment upon which he was found guilty? A. No.

""12. Was I right in permitting the
affidavits on production of Thomas Kelly, Lawrence Kelly and Charles Kelly,
Exhibits 62 and 63, in a civil action of the Attorney-General of Manitoba
against Thomas Kelly & Sons to be put in evidence in the manner disclosed
by the record against the accused Thomas Kelly, and, if not, was the same
prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused? A. To first part of question down
to words 'and, if not'—Yes; to remainder of question—No.

""13. Was I right in the admission of
certain documents (as so called secondary evidence) at the instance of the
Crown, and, if so, was the admission of such documents or of any other exhibits
filed prejudicial

[Page 224]

to a fair trial of the said Thomas Kelly as
set out in Schedule 'D'? A. To first part of question down to and including the
word 'Crown'—Yes; to remainder of question—No.

""14. Was any evidence admitted or
allowed to be given which should not have been admitted or allowed to be given
and which was prejudicial to a fair trial of the said Thomas Kelly, in regard
to the matters set out in Schedule 'E'? A. No.

""15. Was I right in my comments upon the
statement of the accused to the jury, with respect to it not being-made under
oath, and, if so, was this prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused or a
violation of the ""Canada Evidence Act ?"" A. To first part of question
down to and including the word 'oath'—Yes; to remainder of question—No.

""16. Similarly were any of the
observations of counsel for the Crown so inflammatory or improper as to
prejudice the fair trial of the accused or to be a violation of the
""Canada Evidence-Act ?"" A. The first part of this question 'Were any
of the observations of counsel for the Crown so inflammatory or improper as to
prejudice the fair trial of the accused?' is not a question of law that may be
reserved for the Court of Appeal under the Criminal Code . To the second part of
the question—No.

""17. Was there in any respect, on my
part, either a failure to direct the jury or an inaccurate direction to the
jury with regard to the difference between a statement made by the accused to
the jury and an address made on his behalf to a jury; or as to the weight that
a jury is entitled to attach to the statements of the accused which are not
made under oath or as to pointing out evidence favourable to the accused or in
regard to correcting any mis-statements as to law or fact made

[Page 225]

by the Crown counsel during the trial or any
addresses to the jury? A. No.""

The majority of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba, upon the rendering of the judgment appealed from, by which the above
answers were returned, consisted of His Lordship Chief Justice Howell and their
Lordships Justices Perdue and Cameron. Their Lordships Justices Richards and
Haggart dissented and were of opinion that there should be a new trial and that
such new trial should be upon the fourth count of the indictment only.

Dewart K.C. and
Harding for the appellant (Sweatman with them. The inflammatory
and improper observations of counsel for the Crown to the jury afford ground
for a new trial. In Pritchard's Practice of the Quarter Sessions, p. 22, it is
laid down that prosecuting counsel addressing the jury ought to confine
themselves to the simple statement of the facts expected to be proven; where
prisoner has no counsel they should particularly refrain from stating any
facts, proof of which may appear doubtful. Even where the prisoner has counsel,
they should refrain from invective or appealing to the prejudices or passions
of the jury, it being neither in good taste or right feeling to struggle for a
conviction as is done in a civil court: Reg. v. Thursfield[2], per Gurney B. See also Archbold's
Criminal Pleading, (24 ed.,) pp. 219-220; Reg. v. Holchester[3]; per Blackburn, J.; Reg. v. Berens[4]; Reg. v. Webb[5]; Rex v. Webb[6]; Ibrahim v. The King[7], at p. 616.

[Page 226]

We take objection to the comments and
directions, or lack of directions, by the learned trial judge, particularly
regarding theft and false pretences and the failure of the accused to testify.
See Rex v. Hill[8] and Reg.
v. Coleman[9], per
McMahon J., at page 108. The trial judge failed to point out facts
favourable to the accused: Rex v. Dinnick[10]; Rex v. Richards[11]; Rex v. Totty[12]; Reg. v. Parkins[13]; Rex v. Beauchamp[14]; Reg. v. Mills[15].

The learned trial judge failed to clearly
point out to the jury the difference between the offences of theft and
receiving and conspiracy and obtaining by false pretences, and what evidence
was admissible under each offence charged, what evidence affected each count,
and that evidence involving conspiracy could not affect the counts for theft or
false pretences. He should have pointed out the inconsistency of a verdict on
all four counts.: Rex v.Wong On[16];
Reg. v. Paul[17], per
Hawkins J., at p. 211.

There was wrongful admission of evidence in
several respects, more especially relating to earlier events and to later
conspiracies: Reg. v. Blake[18];
Reg. v. Barry[19]. The
admission of evidence, under the second count, upon a general charge of conspiracy
relating to persons other than the accused; and of evidence under count three,
relating to a conspiracy in which the sons of the accused were joined as
parties, altogether apart from the question as to the admissibility of evidence
of subsequent conspiracies, were admissible

[Page 227]

only upon a charge of conspiracy to defraud.
That charge should not have been preferred and evidence tending to prove it was
clearly prejudicial to a fair trial on the remaining counts of the indictment.
This evidence was not admissible under the other counts and the jury should
have been so directed. The view that, by holding that there was ample evidence
of some offence and, consequently, no substantial wrong or miscarriage occurred
cannot prevail; the court cannot be the judge of what may have influenced the
minds of the jury where evidence of an important character was improperly
admitted: Allen v. The King[20];
Bray v. Ford[21]; Makin
v. Attorney-General of New South Wales[22], at pages 69-70.

The first count, which charges theft, is bad
for duplicity: sec. 853 , sub-sec. 3 , Criminal Code ; Halsbury, Laws of England,
vol. 9, p. 340; Reg. v. Lamoureux[23],
at p. 103; Archbold (24 ed.), pp. 75, 76, 81, 84; Rex v. Molleur[24]; Rex v. Michaud[25]; The judge should have charged the jury as
to what constitutes theft, explained the nature of colour of right, that taking
must be against the will of the owner, and also that these elements were
lacking in the case.

The second count is bad for duplicity or for
triplicity; both conspiracy and receiving are charged, an earlier conspiracy
""theretofore,"" and a later receiving. It confuses charges for
receiving what had been embezzled, what had been stolen, and what had been
obtained by a conspiracy to defraud. See Halsbury, vol. 9, p. 678.

[Page 228]

Nowhere in the Extradition Treaty, signed at
Washington on 12th July, 1889, is conspiracy to defraud mentioned; by article
3 , no person surrendered may be tried for any offence other than that upon
which he was surrendered. See also the ""Extradition Act ,"" R.S.C.,
1906, ch. 155, secs. 30 to 32; and R.S.C., 1906, ch. 142, secs. 22 and 23; In
re Gaynor and Greene[26].

As to count four, the judge did not explain
to the jury that the money in question was not parted with upon the strength of
any false representation made by the accused knowing it to be false. No payment
was made except by authority of contract or order-in-council. There can.be
no agency in crime: Reg. v. Butcher[27], at p. 19.

The practice adopted of including in one indictment
many different offences is vicious, because the evidence admitted upon any
count has a prejudicial effect against the prisoner on other counts, and
particularly so where different kinds of crimes are charged with an alternative
count of receiving: Per Hawkins J. in Reg. V. King[28], at p. 216.

The accused cannot be guilty of all four
offences as found by the jury. The conviction could only be on one of these
counts, but there is a specific verdict of guilty on each count: Reg. v.
Russett[29]; Rex
v. Fisher[30]. He
cannot be guilty of any two offences. The penalties vary. The whole conviction
is bad. One guilty of stealing goods as a principal cannot be convicted of
receiving them: Halsbury, vol. 9, page 678 (footnote n). To be guilty of
receiving stolen property

[Page 229]

it must have been taken by a person other
than the person accused of receiving: Reg. v. Lamoureux[31]; Reg. v. Coggins[32]; Reg. v. Perkins[33].

The indictment is also bad for duplicity.
Cyc, vol. 22, 376: ""An indictment or information must not in the same
count charge the prisoner with the commission of two or more distinct and
separate offences and in case it does so it is bad for duplicity."" The
jury having found the prisoner guilty of theft, four kinds of receiving and
false pretences, at the same time found him to be a conspirator. The Crown
deliberately went to trial upon an indictment defective and bad for duplicity,
triplicity and improper joinder, without considering the reservations made by
Mr. Justice Holmes' judgment in the Supreme Court of the United States. The
Crown should stand or fall by its own deliberate action. The conviction should
be quashed.

The object of a motion to quash before trial
is to preserve the rights of the accused at all stages, and particularly in the
event of a verdict against the accused. The Crown has the right to amend, to
sever, to elect which counts shall be proceeded upon—if necessary to prefer a
new indictment or new indictments. But the Crown did not do so and the accused
is entitled to the benefit of all the preliminary objections taken upon the
motion to quash the indictment. The indictment was preferred and found when
appellant was outside the Dominion of Canada, to the knowledge of the
Attorney-General of Manitoba. The motion that was made under section 898  of the
Criminal Code  was absolutely necessary to preserve the rights of the accused as
to any defects. The

[Page 230]

objection then taken was that the indictment
had been preferred by the Attorney-General without legal authority. The
Attorney-General knowing that the accused was not in Canada, in his absence,
and while extradition proceedings were in progress, caused the indictment to be
laid. The Attorney-General had no right to avail himself of the power to prefer
an indictment in the absence of the accused and while he had himself undertaken
proceedings under the ""Extradition Act ."" His consent to preferring
the indictment is not a mere formality: Reg. v. Bradlaugh[34].

J. B. Coyne K.C. and R. W. Craig K.C. for the respondent. The appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada can only be based on the grounds as to which there was
a dissent in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba: Mcintosh v. The Queen[35]; Eberts v. The King[36]; Mulvihill y. The King[37]; See also Rice v. The
King[38]; Gilbert
v. The King[39]. The
second count is not in contravention of the ""Extradition Act "" and the
treaty. It is in the exact terms of the Canadian warrant for Kelly's
apprehension, of the American complaint or information, of the American warrant
for his apprehension, and of the extradition commissioner's recommendation to
the Secretary of State; the accused was surrendered for trial on this charge.

As to conspiracy, see Russell on Crimes (7
ed.), pp. 146 and 191; Reg. v. Parnell[40], at p. 515; Taylor on Evidence (10 ed.),
sec. 591. The offence is complete when the agreement is made: Reg. v. Connelly[41];

[Page 231]

Rex v. Parsons[42]. If, therefore, two persons pursue
by their acts the same object, often by the same means, one performing one part
of the act and the other another part so as to complete it with a view to the
attainment of the common object they were pursuing, the jury are free to infer
that they had been engaged in a conspiracy to effect that object: Reg. v.
Murphy[43], per
Coleridge J.; Rex v. Cope[44];
Rex v. Pollman[45] at
page 233.

A person concerned in any part of the
transaction alleged as conspiracy may be found guilty, though there is no
evidence that he joined in concerting a plan until some of the prior parts of
the transaction were complete: Rex v. Lord Grey[46]; Rex v. Hammond[47]; Stephen's Digest of Evidence (4 ed.),
pages 6 and 7.

See also Rex v. Wilson[48]; Reg. v. Shellard[49]; Reg. v. Blake[50].

The evidence is admitted on the ground that
the act or declaration of one is the act or declaration of all when united in
one common design. It is the principle of agency which, once established,
combines the conspirators together and makes them mutually responsible for the
acts and declarations of each: Wright, Criminal Conspiracy, p. 213, and pp.
212, 216; Russell on Crimes, p. 192; Roscoe, 355 at foot; Rex v. Johnston[51]; Rex v. Nerlich[52]; Reg. v. Jessop[53]; Reg. v. Charles[54], at p. 502; Reg. v. Desmond[55]. There is direct evidence of Kelly's part
in

[Page 232]

tampering with witnesses, fabricating and
suppressing evidence, and upholding the fabricated evidence before the Public
Accounts Committee.

When a criminal act has been proved and it is
desired to connect the accused therewith it is relevant to shew that he had or
had not a motive for the act or means and opportunity of doing it or that he
had made preparations with that end in view or had threatened to do the act;
the subsequent conduct of the accused often furnishes still further cogent
evidence of guilt, e.g., possession of recently stolen property, flight,
or the fabrication or suppression of evidence: 13 Halsbury, pp. 447, 448;
Wigmore on Evidence, sec. 278; Moriarty v. London Chatham and Dover
Rway. Co.[56]. The
fabrication or suppression of evidence is none the less admissible because the
accused called others to his assistance. If conspiracy were the charge it would
not be necessary to set out the overt acts: Reg. v. Blake[57], at page 133; Rex v. Hutchinson[58]; Reg. v. O'Donnell[59] Rex v. Gitt[60]. And if some overt acts were set
out, the Crown would not be confined to them, but might prove others: Reg. v.
Stapylton[61], per
Wightman J., at p. 71.

Crown counsel's address was not an appeal to
prejudice, but a plain and decided statement of the evidence. There can be no
wrong done when statements are founded on evidence. The jury could not possibly
have come to any other conclusion than that of the guilt of the accused on the
evidence submitted irrespective altogether of the language of Crown counsel complained
of. This is not a question

[Page 233]

which can be reserved for the opinion of the
court of appeal: Rex v. Nerlich[62],
per Hodgins J. at p. 317; Rex v. Banks[63].

As to clause 15 of the reserved case and the
charge of trial judge regarding the statement of accused to the jury not being
made under oath. The accused had no right to make a statement. He had the right
to go into the witness-box and give his evidence on oath. There is a
distinction between the English and Canadian Acts. The former has a saving
section, negativing what would otherwise be the law, and providing that,
notwithstanding the fact that he may give evidence on oath, the accused may
still make an unsworn statement: Rex v. Krafchenko[64]., at pp. 658, 659. As to what would
be considered comments, see Rex v. King[65], at page 434; and Rex v. McGuire[66]. The remarks complained of do not
constitute a comment prohibited by the ""Canada Evidence Act ,"" section
4 , sub-section 5 : in Rex v. Hill[67]
and in Reg v. Coleman[68] there
was direct comment on failure to testify. See Reg. v. Weir[69], at pages 269-271; Rex v.
Aho[70]; Rex
v. Guerin[71].

The powers of the appellate court are stated
in the Criminal Code , secs. 1018, 1019 and 1020. Some substantial wrong or
miscarriage must have been occasioned at the trial. The court may give separate
directions as to each count and may pass sentence on any count unaffected by
any wrong or miscarriage which stands good, or may remit the case to the court
below

[Page 234]

with directions to pass such sentence as
justice may require. A new trial is not justified here under sec. 1019 .

There was no reserve case submitted on
joinder of counts and argument on that point must be eliminated. Rex v. Hughes[72], at 454. There was no dissent in
the Court of Appeal on this point. There was no objection to joinder before
pleading, as required by the Code, sec. 898: Reg. v. Flynn[73]. Counts may be joined as in this
indictment: Rex v. Lockett[74];
Rex v. Seham Yousry[75]; Reg.
v. Poolman[76]; Rex
v. Beauchamp[77]; Reg.
v. Smith[78]. Under
the Code, sec. 857, this is a matter in the discretion of the trial judge, and
is not subject to review. There was a conviction on counts 1, 2, 4 and 5. No question
was reserved for the Court of Appeal as to whether such verdict was
inconsistent.

As to the charge on count 1 as to theft, and
as to colour of right. The fraudulent contracts constituted no colour of right:
Reg. v. Kenrick[79]. As
for ""against the will of the owner,"" there was no question as to that
in the evidence. The evidence was that the funds were wrongfully taken and
converted.

As to count 4, obtaining money by false
pretences, the statement of the law by the trial judge was sufficient to guide
the jury in reaching a verdict so long as there was evidence to convict on such
a charge.

The opinions of the Chief Justice and Davies
J. are delivered by Anglin J.

[Page 235]

Dewart K.C. and Harding for the appellant

J. B. Coyne
K.C. and
R. W. Craig K.C. for the respondent.

Idington J.—This appeal arises out of a reserved case in which the learned
trial judge had submitted to the court below seventeen questions. On the
hearing of that appeal two of the learned judges hearing it, dissented, on
points hereinafter referred to, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

Under the authorities cited in argument,
including Reg. v. McIntosh[80];
Rice v. The King[81]; Gilbert
v. The King[82]; Curry
v. The King[83]; Eberts
v. The King[84], at p.
26; Mulvihill v. The King[85],
and other cases cited in the reports of these decisions, I do not think
there can longer be a doubt that our jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a
court of appeal in a criminal case is bounded by the lines of clear dissent on
any point raised therein relative to any of the questions of law properly
involved in the submission of the reserved case.

A dissenting opinion relative to something
outside that which can properly be made part of a reserved case or fails to
bear upon the points of law properly involved in such case as reserved, can
form no part of what we are concerned with.

I respectfully submit that the expressions of
the dissents herein are, as I read them, not clearly confined within these
lines. For example: as regards the grounds taken relative to the questions
raised by the matter in the address of counsel for the Crown I doubt if such an
address can be in itself the subject of a reserved case. I shall presently deal
at length with that subject and the arguments founded on what for brevity's
sake I may call the conspiracy aspect of the case, when what I refer to will
more fully appear.

[Page 236]

I merely desire here to submit, respectfully,
that for want of that definite application of each dissent to the reserved
question it relates to, or what the exact grounds are intended to be covered
thereby, and as the dissents may have implied more than I might find appears,
in order to avoid mistakes, I shall proceed to deal consecutively with each
question in the whole reserved case. I am not, therefore, to be assumed as
departing from what I have just now said of the limits of our own jurisdiction
to act.

There is another boundary to our jurisdiction
expressed in the language of sec. 1019  of the Criminal Code , which is as
follows:—

1019. No conviction shall be set aside nor
any new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly
admitted or rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the
trial or some misdirection given, unless, in the opinion of the court of
appeal, some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the
trial: Provided that if the court of appeal is of opinion that any challenge
for the defence was improperly disallowed, a new trial shall be granted: 55-56
Vict. ch. 29, sec. 746.

Applying this section enables me, for my part,
to dispose of the case, without entering at length, and in minute detail, upon
some of the nice questions which may be involved in the dissenting opinions.

There was a motion made by counsel for the
appellant to quash the indictment, and refused by the learned trial judge.

The first six questions submitted concern the
validity of this refusal and raise the further question of whether or not, if
there be in any case an error therein, there was as a consequence thereof and
the admission of objectionable evidence a mistrial.

There are six counts in the indictment. The
sixth, which is for perjury, was, with the consent of the Crown, directed to
stand over and not to be tried with the others.

[Page 237]

The fifth has been disposed of by the Court of
Appeal.

The first and fourth are ordinary counts for
theft and false pretences, respectively, and I fail to see how any serious
question can have been raised as to them.

The second and third counts may be open to the
criticism that they are of doubtful import, but as the first and fourth counts
enabled the whole of the evidence to be given, which was properly admissible on
the trial, there cannot now, in face of the section quoted above, be any
question of serious import raised as to the validity of the learned judge's
refusal to quash.

The attempt to use the particulars delivered ten
days later than this motion to quash, illustrates how absurd this part of the
contention in the case is.

The complaint made that the learned trial judge
did not, in his charge, enter upon a specific attempt to deal in detail with,
and direct the jury as to, each of these counts, and what they mean and might
be held to imply, seems unfounded, for his mode of treatment left the appellant
without any ground of complaint in regard thereto. Had he done as suggested I
imagine there might have been some ground for suggesting that the minds of the
jury had been thereby confused.

The case was presented by him in his charge as
one of stealing, or receiving that stolen, or of obtaining by false pretences.
He wisely abstained from needlessly entering upon such a field of mystification
as we have had presented to us to deal with and hence his charge misled nobody.

There was at the close of the trial a distinct
question put by the foreman of the jury which led the learned judge to tell the
jury they could not bring in a verdict of guilty on both these second and third
counts,

[Page 238]

but must, if either included in a verdict of
guilty, select one or other thereof.

Their verdict was guilty on the first, second,
fourth and fifth counts.

There was, therefore, no substantial wrong or
miscarriage in the refusal to quash or in consequence thereof.

As to question 7, which is as follows:—

7. Was I right in my charge to the jury on
the first count of the indictment as to theft or was my charge insufficient in
law so as to be prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused?

There is raised thereby perhaps the most
important and difficult question in the reserved case.

The learned judge relied upon section 347  of the
Criminal Code  and I think he was right in doing so. It is a most comprehensive
definition of theft and is as follows:—

347. Theft or stealing is the act of
fraudulently and without colour of right taking, or fraudulently and without
colour of right converting to the use of any person, any thing capable of being
stolen, with intent,—

(a) to deprive the owner, or
any person having any special property or interest therein, temporarily, or
absolutely, of such thing, or of such property or interest; or,

(b) to pledge the same or deposit it
as security; or

(c) to part with it under a
condition as to its return which the person parting with it may be unable to
perform; or,

(d). to deal with it in such
a manner that it cannot be restored to the condition in which it was at the
time of such taking and conversion.

2. Theft is committed when the offender
moves the thing or causes it to move or to be moved, or begins to cause it to
become movable, with intent to steal it.

3. The taking or conversion may be
fraudulent, although effected without secrecy or attempt at concealment.

4. It is immaterial whether the thing
converted was taken for the purpose of conversion, or whether it was, at the
time of the conversion, in the lawful possession of the person converting:
55-56 Vict., ch. 29, sec. 305.

""Anything capable of being stolen""
might not cover money in the bank to the credit of any person, but

[Page 239]

surely it does include a cheque to draw that
money. I think a cheque being an order for money is a valuable security within
the words of the indictment. Can it be said that the fraudulent means resorted
to in order to induce the Lieutenant-Governor and others to do those acts which
resulted in the preparation of the cheque and its due signature having preceded
its existence, therefore the appellant guilty with others in bringing those
acts about, can have acquired a colour of right to use it or convert it to his
use?

I think not, and that if the appellant by reason
of his fraudulent acts was not entitled to have received any of the cheques
issued to him, he had no right to convert them to his use.

They each remained the property of the Crown
recoverable by respondent, if so advised, from appellant at any instant until
passed into the hands of the bank without notice. The language of sub-sec. 4
seems clearly to bear this out and to cover just such cases as this.

The later sections dealing with what used to be
called embezzlement are in harmony with this view. The evident purpose of the
section, as a whole, was to make clear that the fraudulent nature of the
dealing was to be the test of whether or not the wrongful conversion was to be
treated as theft or not.

Counsel for respondent in their factum suggest
that the moneys had been stolen by the Minister and thereby there was a
conversion of the money to which appellant was a party as accessory and hence
he was liable as a principal.

My difficulty is in extending the section to a
theft of money in the bank for it contemplates a taking which could not, I submit,
be within the meaning of the section.

[Page 240]

The same counsel in, argument also submitted the
amendment to the English ""Larceny Act"" in 1861, section 70, aimed at
officers of the government, and that such amendment was introduced by the Act
introducing English law into Manitoba.

In my view it is not necessary to pass any
opinion upon this contention.

If appellant could be guilty of stealing the
cheques, then there is no need for prosecuting the inquiry.

The eighth question seems upon the evidence hardly
arguable.

Clearly there was an obtaining of money by false
pretences whatever may be said of the other charges as a matter of law.

The ninth question, which is as follows:

9. Was I right in admitting evidence as to
acts, conduct, admissions, conversations and facts relating to some one or more
of those named in the second count, namely: Rodmond P. Roblin, Walter H.
Montague (since deceased), James H. Howden, George R. Coldwell, R. M. Simpson
and Victor W. Horwood, to which the accused was not a party, and if I have
erred, was the same prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused?

raised at first, in argument, a doubt in my
mind, when it was urged by counsel for appellant that the moneys obtained had
all been obtained before the end of December, 1914, and the offences charged
had then been completed and much of the evidence here in question related to
later events.

It was alleged that what transpired later was in
fact nothing but evidence of a new conspiracy and neither had nor could have
had any direct relation to or be in any way a necessary result of the original
conspiracy.

If the facts would justify this or some such way
of looking at the admissibility of the later evidence I agree a grave question
would have arisen.

[Page 241]

It is, however, quite clear when one is enabled
by a knowledge of the evidence to grasp the actual situation that this
contention of appellant is hardly worthy of serious consideration.

The Crown alleges in fact the existence of a
conspiracy on the part of those named, or some of them, including the accused,
to use the opportunity of the erection of the public buildings—known as
Parliament Buildings—for the improper purpose of diverting funds ostensibly
voted by the legislature for that purpose, and the property of the Crown as charged,
into the hands of some one for the purpose of forming part of a political
campaign fund, or possibly dividing or distributing amongst them, or some of
them, moneys so diverted.

It matters not what the purpose was so long as
moneys were, from time to time during the progress of such works, to be
diverted from their proper purpose as designated by the legislature.

There was evidence that justified such an
inference and it was of such weight as to entitle the Crown to have the whole
relative thereto fully developed.

Touching the mere questions of admissibility of
such evidence the learned trial judge had to consider the nature of the charges
either as alleged in the pleadings or presented by counsel for the Crown, and
then the evidence already presented tending to support any such pretensions and
determine whether in view of all that had preceded such later developments
could reasonably be connected therewith.

In default of that being quite apparent from the
case as developed, learned trial judges often, for convenience sake, have to
rely upon the undertaking of the counsel presenting such like evidence that it
will be connected with that preceding or to follow in such

[Page 242]

a way as to be relevant to the issues in
question and maintain the contention put forward.

The mere technical questions of admissibility as
presented in the question does not therefore go very far.

If, however, it should in such case turn out
that the evidence could not be connected with other evidence in a way to form
an arguable case, the consequences would have to be dealt with effectively to
see that there was no miscarriage of justice. Here it is not merely the
admissibility as that is put in the question that might have been involved.

Not only was it contended that the evidence of
the later acts I have referred to were inadmissible, but also that the whole
evidence of conspiracy, or to put it in another and less controversial form, of
agreement to act together in pursuance of the common purpose of diverting a
part of the money appropriated for said buildings, so attacked was quite
inadmissible unless appellant was present.

I cannot assent thereto. Whatever our reason
will maintain as fairly inferable from the circumstances presented must be the
test. The accused, of course, must be so connected with those circumstances or
part thereof as to justify, by that test, the maintenance of the inference
argued for.

But, unfortunately for the appellant, his
connection with the later developments has been shewn in fact to be so intimate
and close that there is no need for straining the application of the principles
I am relying upon to bring home to him the desire to destroy evidence and
hinder its production and promote thereby the concealment of all that had
transpired which might tend to shew him and others as having designed by their

[Page 243]

co-operation to divert and to have succeeded in
diverting moneys from their destined purpose.

And the desire to destroy, when existent in some
bosoms, seems soon to produce destruction.

In each of the sections 69  and 70  of the
Criminal Code  there has been formulated a legislative guide expressive of the
law which may be relied upon as an effective answer to all that has been put
forward or that may be implied therein, in any way, bearing upon the many
questions or many forms of the same question in contending against the use of
anything done by others unless clearly and expressly directed by him.

The second sub-section of said section 69 , is as
follows:—

2. If several persons form a common
intention to prosecute any unlawful purpose, and to assist each other therein,
each of them is a party to every offence committed by any one of them in the
prosecution of such common purpose, the commission of which offence was, or
ought to have been known to be a probable consequence of the prosecution of
such common purpose: 55-56 Vict., ch. 29, sec. 61.

The general and comprehensive declaration of the
law binds and goes a long way to define what may be admitted in evidence in
cases of this kind.

It is but a deduction of that which in reason,
must necessarily open the way to the introduction of evidence, in order to lay
before the court those circumstances, from which it may be reasonable to infer
concurrence of action on the part of the accused in regard to what is in
question.

It is quite clear from the evidence that though
the moneys got had been paid before the end of December, 1914, yet the scheme,
as a whole, was far from complete, and had been only interrupted by steps in
the way of inquiry before a committee of the legislature, which seemed likely
to lead to an exposure that would prevent its full fruition. Hence it became
necessary

[Page 244]

for those concerned, actively led by the accused
as commander of the forces as it were, to destroy evidence and keep witnesses
out of the way. He had been paid far in excess of the work, done and was
proceeding with further execution of the work. That payment, however, was a
mere incident of all that had been planned.

I have no doubt that all that which was
introduced as evidence at the trial in the way complained of, in order to prove
concealment of a fraudulent purpose in relation to said payments, was properly
admissible and evidence from which proper inferences might be drawn tending to
establish that purpose and the character thereof.

I shall presently advert to another aspect of
this question of conspiracy and its bearing on the case.

Question. 10 seems, as put, hardly arguable.

Question 11 seems of the same nature and to call
for the same reply, for, as put, it does not indicate that there was any
evidence adduced which bore only upon the third count and could have an
improper bearing upon other counts.

Question 12 was hardly pressed before us and I
see no reason why such an affidavit should not be admitted under the
circumstances. Moreover, the objection has no support in the dissenting
opinions. On the contrary it is overruled in that of Mr. Justice Richards.

The same answer may be made as to questions 13
and 14 save that the learned judges dissenting made no observation anent same.

Question 15 is as follows:—

15. Was I right in my comments upon the
statement of the accused to the jury, with respect to it not being made under
oath, and if so, was this prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused or a
violation of the ""Canada Evidence Act ?""

[Page 245]

I desire to consider this and part of Question
17, together.

It seems difficult to understand how the proper
remark of the learned trial judge can be construed as an infringement of the
""Evidence Act.""

It may be quite permissible for the accused,
when undefended, to state his version of what has been given in evidence in
order to bring home to the minds of the jurors the possibility that the
evidence as it stands or, either by reason of the way in which it has been
presented in the giving thereof or the summing up of Crown counsel may mislead,
and by his statement induce a reconsideration of anything so tending. Any
misleading construction put upon it to the detriment of the accused may thereby
be cured.

When the accused in his address chooses to
present his version and adds thereby something in way of statement of fact
relevant to that which is properly before the jury, they are not only entitled
but bound to consider what the accused has said including his statement of alleged
fact.

But they, when considering same, can only
properly consider it in the way of an explanation which may induce them to turn
their minds towards the evidence which has been sworn to and see if as a whole
it can properly bear the interpretation which the statement of fact made by the
accused suggests as a possibility.

If on the evidence it cannot properly be so
understood their duty is to discard the statement entirely for it is not
evidence. That is in substance the effect of what the learned trial judge told
them and therefore, his charge is in that regard unobjectionable.

The learned judge undoubtedly erred as he
suggests, in allowing the accused to wander far beyond the issues

[Page 246]

and introduce topics and allege statements of
pretended fact which had nothing to do with the simple issues of fact properly
before the court. No one had the slightest right to do so, and above all things
to make charges against or to insult opposing counsel by dragging in something
as the accused did, which had nothing to do with the issues being tried.

If the accused dispensed with counsel, as quite
possibly he did, in hopes of being allowed to drag in by way of his address
something which was not permissible and what no counsel could or would venture
upon doing, it is to be regretted he was permitted the measure of success he
got.

As I gather from the learned judge's charge he
felt he had erred and tried to rectify it by pointing out that statements of
the accused in an address are not evidence and are not to be treated as such.
He would have erred if he had failed under such circumstances in making plain
as he did the law on the subject.

Question sixteen is as follows:—

16. Similarly were any of the observations
of counsel for the Crown so inflammatory or improper as to prejudice the fair
trial of the accused or to be a violation of the ""Canada Evidence
Act ?""

The question as presented does not, I incline to
think, put forward any question of law and hence is beyond that which we are
entitled to act upon. It is put forward, however, at great length and, if I may
be permitted to say so, given undue prominence.

We have presented in appellant's factum extracts
culled from an address which occupies twenty-five printed pages of the appeal
book. It is not difficult when such extracts are taken from their context to
try and create an unpleasant impression. Some of these extracts are unfair
presentations of what was intended.

The late Sir James Stephen, in his History of
the

[Page 247]

Criminal Law of England, vol. 1, p. 429, deals
with the question of Crown counsel addresses, and there says:—

It is very rare to hear arguments pressed
against prisoners with any special warmth of feeling or of language; one reason
for which no doubt is, that any counsel who did so would probably defeat his
own object.0 Apart, however, from this, it is worthy of observation
that eloquence either in prosecuting or defending prisoners is almost unknown
and unattempted at the bar. The occasion seldom permits of it, and the whole
atmosphere of English courts in these days is unfavourable to anything like an
appeal to the feelings—though, of course, in particular cases, topics of
prejudice are introduced.

Some few things said by counsel in summing up
perhaps transgress these traditions of the English bar.

But wherein exists the question of law raised?

It certainly does not appear in the question
sixteen or in these extracts as self evident.

I am not prepared to lay down as law that out of
a Crown counsel's address there cannot arise ground for a reserved case.

I can imagine a case (such as does not exist
here) of counsel misstating the law and the fact in such terms as to call for
the prompt interference of the trial judge, and for his rectification of any
wrong done thereby, by warning and directing the jury not to be misled thereby.

It is not the misstatements in the address which
alone can furnish ground for a reserved case upon a point of law, but those
coupled with failure on the part of the learned trial judge to see such errors
rectified, that, in my opinion, can constitute grounds for a reserved case. In
such event the least that should be required is a statement in the reserved
case concisely setting forth exactly what is complained of. A general
suggestion such as put in questions 16 and 17 does not satisfy what should be
required.

[Page 248]

It does not seem to me that we have here any
such definite statement of what is in question as the statute requires to be
set forth in a stated case reserved for the appellate court.

In any event we are here confined to what
appears in the dissenting opinions.

Mr. Justice Richards selects the criticism by
the Crown counsel of the failure of the accused to be defended by counsel. The
whole of the episode and real or affected resentment because a postponement of
more than two weeks for preparation by counsel was refused deserved severe
criticism. And I am not prepared to find any legal ground for interference
merely because the language in which it was couched might have been better
chosen, when the conduct in question deserved some observations from both Crown
counsel and the learned trial judge to have been passed upon it. A firm,
temperate rebuke was in order if respect for the bench is to be maintained.

Mr. Justice Richards further selects the
misstatement of the law by the Crown counsel as to the crimes charged in the
indictment, but, as I most respectfully submit, it may be my misfortune that my
own view rather accords with that in substance which I take it was intended to
be presented by the Crown counsel rather than what Mr. Justice Richards holds.
I hardly think we can make much of that complaint.

Again he selects the expression as to accused
thinking himself to be guilty. As I read the address it contains two pages of
evidence quoted by counsel attempting to demonstrate in a fairly arguable
manner that such is the inference to be drawn from the evidence quoted.

Counsel certainly on this occasion and others
should not have stated, as he did, his own opinion,

[Page 249]

instead of making a submission of his contention
for consideration by those addressed.

I am not prepared to hold that there was any
substantial wrong or miscarriage created either thereby or by the omission of
the learned trial Judge to specifically call attention to the error and warn
the jury against it.

The remaining passages, selected by Mr. Justice
Richards as the subject of observation, seem to me of the character which (as
Sir James Stephen remarks in the quotation above) would tend to defeat
counsel's object.

I am quite sure the matters with which they deal
could have been presented in a calm, lucid way that would have carried more
weight with the jury and had a crushing effect, if the evidence is to be
believed, beyond anything that is complained of.

And hence I fail to find that the omission of
the learned trial judge to specifically deal therewith in each phase thereof,
furnishes a reason to believe there has been any substantial wrong or
miscarriage.

I repeat it is only by virtue of such omissions
that a question of law can arise.

The learned trial judge's charge was fair and in
general terms covered all that is gathered thus from the address of counsel.

Mr, Justice Haggart assigns nothing further on
this question than that already referred to by Mr. Justice Richards.

In parting with this part of the case I think it
is due to Mr. Coyne to say that whatever may be said or thought of the error in
the mode of address used by his leader in summing up, he ought not to have been
attacked, as he has been, for he was doing no more

[Page 250]

than his duty in repudiating what accused
improperly dragged into the case.

I cannot think that under the circumstances the
granting of a new trial, by reason of anything that is thus complained of,
would conduce to the due administration of justice.

There remains for consideration the objection
taken by Mr. Justice Richards in one form, and by Mr. Justice Haggart in
another, relative to the charge of conspiracy alleged to be made in the second
and third counts of the indictment and all bearing thereupon or flowing
therefrom. These counts cannot, I submit, be held to be in law an indictment
for conspiracy.

They are, by the express language used, clearly
intended to be charges against the accused, of unlawfully receiving money,
valuable securities or other property, belonging to the respondent which had
been stolen by means of a conspiracy.

How can that be pretended to be a count framed
to charge a conspiracy? If nothing had been adduced in evidence but that
tending to establish a conspiracy and on the trial all reference to its
successful accomplishment had been omitted, would any court or judge listen
long to a prosecuting counsel professing to desire the charge of conspiracy to
be submitted on such a count to a jury and proposing to ask them to find the
accused guilty of conspiracy? I venture to think no judge could be got to
assent to such a proposition.

It seems to me this is the proper test to apply
to what is suggested and elaborately argued relative to the infringement of the
Extradition Treaty under which the accused was surrendered.

So tested, there is not a single ground upon
which

[Page 251]

in reason or authority the claim to exclude
evidence because it would tend to prove a conspiracy, can be maintained.

Again, suppose the words

by means of an unlawful conspiracy by
fraudulent means of Thomas Kelly aforesaid, Rodmond P. Roblin, Walter H.
Montague (since deceased), James H. Howden, George R. Coldwell, R. M. Simpson,
Victor H. Horwood and others unknown to defraud His Majesty

had been omitted from each of these second and
third counts and each then stood as a count in the ordinary form of obtaining
money or valuable securities, or property by false pretences, and it had been
attempted to prove exactly what has been proven and no one ever used the word ""conspiracy""
but the facts were offered to conclusively establish the means whereby the
wrongs complained of had been accomplished, would any trial judge rule out any
of the evidence? On what ground could he?

The charge is, in this amended count I suggest,
that the money, or securities, or property had been theretofore stolen. The
means used is not stated in the amended form I suggest. How could the judge be
asked to reject the evidence? Would he listen to, or give effect to, the
argument that it had unexpectedly been disclosed that the accused was one of
those who had counselled the original crime of theft and therefore he could not
be convicted of unlawfully receiving that which he was an accessory to the
stealing of?

The fact is notorious that in many criminal circles
there exist men who act as fences. Could such a man secure his acquittal on a
charge of receiving stolen goods, by proving that he had directed those usually
doing the actual stealing and bringing him the goods, to take these goods in
question from some one he had pointed out?

[Page 252]

Such proof would constitute him a principal
liable to be found guilty of the theft.

Whoever supposed that because it had this or in
some such way developed that the man accused of receiving stolen goods was in
fact liable to be charged as a principal, he would be entitled to his
acquittal?

Since when has it been law that a man indicted
for a minor offence can claim acquittal on any such theory?

I have always supposed that the Crown was
entitled to prosecute for that of which a man was clearly guilty even if he was
suspected of being liable to be held for a higher or greater offence and a
diligent inquiry might produce evidence thereof.

Whatever might be the duty of a. Crown officer
under such circumstances can have no bearing upon the legal result.

The Crown is entitled to lay the charge for
whatever is deemed appropriate to the evidence at hand. And if tried for that
for which the Crown has so chosen to indict him, the accused can never again be
arraigned and tried for another offence upon the same facts.

Those apprehensive that the accused might suffer
wrong by reason of such a proceeding will be relieved by a perusal of those
parts of Archbold's Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice (22 ed.) pp. 150 et
seq. where the work deals with the subjects of autrefois acquit and autrefois
convict, and cites the numerous authorities on the subject.

So much for the possible wrong or miscarriage.

Moreover does it not seem idle to argue about
the wrong done by a suggested possibility of these counts containing more than
one charge, in face of the provisions for inserting in one indictment any
number of offences and only one or two, but none of these, are excepted from
being so dealt with.

[Page 253]

Then again we have the further provisions
contained in section 951, of which the first sub-section is as follows:—

951. Every count shall be deemed divisible;
and if the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment
creating the offence or as charged in the count, includes the commission of any
other offence, the person accused may be convicted of any offence so included
which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not proved; or he may be
convicted of an attempt to commit any offence so included.

This alone should be held to cover all the
objections revolving around these two counts and dispose of all except the
conspiracy question already dealt with and about to be referred to. Though the
section just quoted and others give wide scope for acting under in order to
relieve trials from the danger of being wrecked by some mere play upon words or
trifling frivolities so dear to the hearts of ancient pleaders now dead, the
duty remains to have it kept clear during the trial what the court is about to
try and is trying an accused for.

Not only as I submit was there no doubt in this
case in the minds of any one, but special pains were taken by counsel for the
Crown and the learned trial judge to make clear that there was no charge of
conspiracy made by the indictment, and the only reference made thereto was part
of the inducement in the pleadings explaining the means whereby the crimes
charged were accomplished. I imagine no juryman in Manitoba was ever stupid
enough to fail to understand what he was thus told.

To meet some points pressed upon us though not
open for action as I read the reserved case, I may add a few sentences and cite
some precedents covering things so urged or pointed at. Even the question of a
man being charged with receiving that which he might

[Page 254]

not only be charged with having stolen but was
in fact guilty of, is covered by authority in the case of Reg, v. Hughes[86].

There might have been raised a more arguable
case than some parts of this one on the ground of the verdict of guilty being
entered for both the theft and the receiving of that stolen inasmuch as the
punishments respectively assigned to such offences are not the same. Counsel
for appellant seemed to think some such question was raised and put it forward
in several ways. The case of Rex v. Darley[87] and other cases referred to in Chitty's
Criminal Law (18 ed.), when dealing with the law as it stood one hundred years
ago, suggest the contention would have been unavailing.

What could be dealt with in a practical common
sense fashion under the state of law then cannot surely furnish obstacles to
the execution of justice now in view of the effort made by the legislature to
remove such like barriers from the successful administration of justice and
reduce all that is involved to the simplicity so much to be desired.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Duff J.—There was, I think, no evidence to support a conviction on the
charge of theft. In each case the authorities having custody on behalf of the
Crown of the moneys paid to Kelly intended to pass the property in these very
moneys to Kelly. Except as to the contention advanced on behalf of the Crown to
which I am about to refer, it is sufficient to say that touching this branch of
the appeal I adopt the reasoning of Mr. Justice Richards.

The answer to the learned judge's reasoning put

[Page 255]

forward by counsel for the Crown appears in the
following extract from the factum:—

Mr. Justice Richards errs in holding that
count 1 of the indictment is negatived by the evidence. He apparently looks at the
count as charging Kelly with actually himself stealing or embezzling the
moneys. He apparently overlooks Kelly's position as an accessory before the
fact to misappropriation of the public funds by the ministers. If he does not
overlook this, then his view must be based on a restricted view of the
definition of theft in the Criminal Code , sec. 347 , which would limit the
operation of that section to the taking of anything capable of being
stolen, all the cases cited by him being judgments dealing with the question of
the offence of larceny at common law. This leaves out of consideration theft by
conversion under this section, which is committed whenever a person already in
possession of personal property, with the owner's consent, fraudulently and
without colour of right converts it to his own use or to the use of any other
person than the owner of it with intent to deprive the owner of such property,
or so to deal with it that it cannot be restored. The contention of the Crown
is, and the evidence shews, that the cheques upon the funds of His Majesty the
King in the right of the Province of Manitoba, and the moneys subsequently paid
on those cheques were received under circumstances that constituted a theft or
embezzlement by Messrs. Roblin, Coldwell, Howden and Montague in combination
with Messrs. Kelly, Simpson and Horwood. To this Kelly contributed by being an
accessory before the fact, and is therefore in law a principal in the
commission of the offence, under sec. 69  of the Criminal Code , by reason of which
there is no longer any distinction between a principal and an accessory before
the fact.

See. Crankshaw, p. 72:—

""A principal may be the actual
perpetrator of the act, that is, the one who, with his own hands or through an
innocent agent, does the act itself; he may be one who, before the act is done,
does or omits something for the purpose of aiding some one to commit it; he may
be one who is present aiding and abetting another in the doing of it; or he may
be one who counsels or procures the doing of it, or who does it through the
medium of a guilty agent.""

The assumption underlying this argument is that
the Ministers Roblin, Coldwell, Howden and Montague being in possession of
moneys of the Crown could be convicted of unlawful conversion of the moneys
under section 347  of the Criminal Code . When pressed for evidence that these
moneys were in the possession of these ministers in contemplation of law, that
is to say, within the meaning of the enactment

[Page 256]

relied upon, counsel were unable to point to any
evidence of such possession. The fallacy of the argument lies in taking it for
granted that the political (as distinguished from legal) control of the
machinery of administration which, subject in the last resort to the authority
of the Lieutenant-Governor, rested in the hands of these persons was equivalent
in law to such possession and that in putting such machinery in motion, which
they were able to do by falsifying the facts and thereby enabling Kelly to
procure the moneys in question, they were guilty of the criminal offence of
conversion within the contemplation of section 347 .

The point may be illustrated by reference to the
moneys paid under authority of orders-in-council. It was argued that as these
ministers, or some of them, constituted a majority of the executive on whose
advice the orders were passed, their acts in procuring the passing of them, and
indirectly, by means of the orders, the issue of cheques payable to Kelly
amounted to ""conversion"" in point of law.

But in truth these moneys were the moneys of His
Majesty lawfully disbursable only on the order of His Majesty's representative,
the Lieutenant-Governor (acting it is true on the advice of his Executive
Council) and by the instrumentality of cheques signed by certain permanent officials,
one of them being the Auditor. The moneys were in the possession of the Crown
subject to disposition only by following a procedure prescribed by law; and
though the advice of the Executive was a necessary part of this procedure, it
was by no means the whole of it. Nor were the other essential acts, such for
example as the concurrence of the Lieutenant-Governor which in these cases was
obtained by deceiving him as to the facts of a character so purely ministerial
as to justify

[Page 257]

the conclusion that these moneys were in law
under the control of the ministers as depositaries. The truth is that, in law,
the function of these persons was advisory only, the effective executive acts
were the acts of others.

This is, of course, not to say that the conduct
of Roblin and his associates, regard being had to their obligations as holders
of high public office, was not (leaving out of view the law relating to
conspiracy and obtaining money under false pretences) such conduct as the law
notices and punishes as criminal under another head or other heads than theft.

The charge of receiving moneys knowing that such
moneys had theretofore been embezzled, stolen or fraudulently obtained also, in
my opinion, fails for the reason that up to the moment when the moneys in
question were ""received"" by Kelly they remained in possession of the
Crown and had not up to that moment been ""obtained"" by anybody not
entitled to have them. The appellant is consequently entitled to have the
conviction against him in respect of count No. 1 and count No. 2 quashed as
being unsupported by evidence.

Mr. Coyne, as counsel representing the Crown,
quite properly stated in the argument that the Crown submitted to the judgment
of the Court of Appeal being treated as if it provided under section 1020  of
the Criminal Code  that the penalty should be limited to the lowest maximum,
penalty allowed by law to be imposed as the result of a conviction on the
first, second and fourth counts.

I have nevertheless expressed my opinion upon
the points above discussed because that, as I think, is due in strict justice
to the appellant. In a court of morals no difference may be perceptible between
the crime

[Page 258]

charged in the first count and that charged in
the fourth count; yet the law does (as the difference in severity of the
penalties attached to these crimes respectively demonstrates) regard the first
mentioned offence as much the graver and it is right I think to state my
opinion that of the graver offence he could not properly be convicted.

Before coming to the crucial questions relating
specifically to the conviction on count number four it is convenient to deal
with the objection (which might have been a formidable one if founded in fact)
that the trial as actually conducted was in truth a trial for conspiracy—a
non-extraditable offence. The objection has no sub-stratum of fact. The
officers of the Crown were entitled; and indeed it was their duty, in the
circumstances, to bring before the jury all facts legally admissible in
evidence which might tend to establish the fraud charged to the satisfaction of
the jury. The design and the concerted action in furtherance of it were rightly
proved and emphazised—not for the purpose of obtaining a conviction for
conspiracy as a substantive offence—but as establishing the responsibility of
Kelly for certain acts and as exhibiting the character and operation of the
dishonest scheme which, as the Crown alleged, disclosed the criminal intent
that was an essential ingredient in the offence charged under any of counts
one, two or four.

The appellant asks for a new trial in respect of
the fourth count of the indictment on the ground that the law was departed from
at the trial in (1) comments alleged to have been made on his failure to
testify on his own behalf; (2) the reception of inadmissible evidence; (3)
unfairness of the trial in respect of extreme

[Page 259]

and inflammatory observations by counsel for the
Crown.

As to the first of these grounds I can find
nothing, which, when fairly construed, amounts to such comment within the
meaning of the statutory prohibition.

As to the second ground (which was also put in
the form of an objection that the learned judge failed to point out to the jury
the evidence admissible under counts one and two that would not be admissible
under count four) the only exception requiring comment is that relating to
evidence of acts which were done after the last of the payments in question had
been made (December, 1914), and to which Kelly was not proved to be an
immediate party. Kelly it is said could not be held to be a party to these acts
indirectly or constructively by reason of the conspiracy proved to obtain these
moneys by fraud, as the object of that conspiracy was completely accomplished
when the last payment was made. This objection is not, I think, well founded.
These acts it was argued with a great deal of force (and I am inclined to think
the argument is sound) which were concerned with measures for the prevention of
discovery and disclosure were well within the original design. But be that as
it may there is sufficient evidence of concert in preventing discovery and
disclosure to establish a subsidiary conspiracy in which Kelly was involved
with that as its object; and acts done in furtherance of such a conspiracy
would be admissible in support of the charge of mens rea.

As to all these alleged grounds for granting a
new trial it should be observed that the jurisdiction of the court of Crown
cases reserved in Manitoba as well as the jurisdiction of this court in
criminal appeals is

[Page 260]

derived from statute and that in exercising that
jurisdiction both courts are strictly bound by the rule that no new trial can
be granted unless there has been some error, by which ""some substantial
wrong or miscarriage"" has been occasioned ""on the trial"" (Crim.
Code, sec. 1019).

The guilt of the appellant as regards the
offence charged by the fourth count (obtaining money by false pretences) is
demonstrated by evidence indisputably admissible No jury directing its
attention exclusively to that evidence could, unless bent upon not giving
effect to the law, have failed to find a verdict of guilty on that count.

In these circumstances there was obviously no
""miscarriage;"" and assuming there was some technical
""wrong"" there can be in my judgment no ""substantial wrong""
from the admission of inadmissible evidence if it must be affirmed that
relatively to the whole mass of admissible evidence that which is open to
exception is merely negligible and that in the absence of it the verdict could
not have been otherwise. This conclusion is in no way inconsistent with the
acceptance of the criterion suggested in Makin's Case[88], at pages 70 and 71.
In such a case the impeached evidence cannot in any practical sense be supposed
""to have had any influence upon the verdict.""

As to the ground numbered three upon which a new
trial is prayed it may be added that although some of the observations of the
learned Crown counsel were no doubt excessively heightened, it is impossible to
think that in the circumstances of this case the accused could suffer in
consequence of them. Such expressions could not deepen the effect of a bare
recital of the

[Page 261]

facts in the story which the officers of the
Crown had to put before the jury.

The opinion of the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice
Davies and Mr. Justice Anglin was delivered by

Anglin J.—Although the conviction of the appellant on three distinct counts
in an indictment—No. 1, for theft, No. 2 for receiving, and No. 4 for obtaining
money by false pretences—was upheld by a majority of the learned judges of the
Court of Appeal for Manitoba, the Chief Justice, as we understand with the
concurrence of Mr. Justice Perdue and Mr. Justice Cameron, said (35 West. L.R.
57):—

It is difficult to see how the accused
should for one crime be found guilty on the first, second and fourth counts.
That he has committed a crime seems by the evidence to be clearly established,
and it is perhaps best established under the fourth count.

I assume that the trial judge in
pronouncing sentence will consider that the accused was found guilty of but one
crime, and in considering the maximum sentence allowed by law I think he should
be guided by the lowest maximum fixed by law for either of the three crimes set
forth in the first, second and fourth counts.

This course being taken, I do not think
such substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned at the trial as would
justify a new trial under sec. 1019 of the Code.

There seems no necessity to interfere with
the finding of guilty on the inconsistent counts. He was certainly guilty of
one of them and as he will be punished on one only, I would follow the course
taken in Rex v. Lockett[89].

The formal judgment of the court, however, does
not direct that the penalty to be imposed shall be so limited; but Mr. Coyne,
while vigorously insisting that the conviction on all three counts should be
sustained, stated at bar in this Court that, as counsel representing the Crown,
he submitted to the judgment of the Court of Appeal being dealt with as if it
contained a provi-

[Page 262]

sion under section 1020  of the Criminal Code 
limiting the penalty as indicated by the learned Chief Justice.

Having regard to all the circumstances of the
case, and especially to the possible embarrassment which may have been caused
by the trial together of five separate counts, and to the fact that the learned
trial judge, while he carefully defined each of the offences charged, deemed it
advisable to abstain from instructing the jury as to the facts in evidence
bearing upon each branch of the indictment, we think the position taken by
counsel for the Crown eminently proper and that ""we ought to treat the
verdict as a verdict on the lesser charge,"" namely, that of obtaining
money by false pretences: Rex v. Norman[90], at page 343; Rex v. Lockett[91].

On this charge we find no dissent in the Court
of Appeal on the two propositions; that the count itself was properly laid and
that there was sufficient evidence to justify conviction upon it. The appellant
urges as grounds for a new trial on this count, warranted by the opinions of
the two dissenting judges, (a) that the conduct of the case may
have given the jury the impression that the accused was on trial for
conspiracy—a non-extraditable offence; (b) alleged comment on the
failure of the accused to testify on his own behalf; (c) inflammatory
and improper observations of Crown counsel; (d) failure of the learned
trial judge to direct the attention of the jury to evidence favourable to the
accused and. to correct mis-statements of law by Crown counsel; and (e)
the reception of inadmissible evidence and the failure of the learned judge to
instruct the jury that certain evidence, though admissible on other

[Page 263]

counts, should not be considered in disposing of
the fourth count.

If ground (a) is covered by any
question in the reserved case, in view of the explicit and reiterated warning
given to the jury by the trial judge (emphasizing similar statements made to
them by counsel for the Crown and by the defendant himself) that ""the
accused is not charged with conspiracy''—""What he is charged with is not
conspiracy""—and again, ""Remember that it is not the direct charge he
is answering""—it is impossible to accede to the suggestion that the jury
may have been misled as to the offences really charged; (b) There was no
comment whatever on the failure of the accused to testify. His right to do so
was not mentioned during the trial. The learned judge merely discharged his
duty in warning the jury against treating the statement which he had allowed
the accused to make as the equivalent of sworn testimony; (c) Whether
there is any question of law reserved on this point is, to say the least,
questionable.

But without dwelling further on the several
grounds urged, and without determining that in regard to any of them there has
been such error in law as would, if ""some substantial wrong or miscarriage
(had been) thereby occasioned on the trial"" (Crim. Code, sec. 1019), have
entitled the appellant to a new trial, we are of the opinion that his guilt on
the fourth count has been established by uncontradicted evidence, of which the
admissibility upon that count has not been and could not be successfully
challenged, so complete and so convincing that in regard to that count a
substantial miscarriage on the trial is out of the question and the matters
complained of, whether taken singly or cumulatively, are ""most unlikely to
have affected the

[Page 264]

verdict:"" Ibrahim v. The King[92], at page 616, if indeed it is not
impossible that they could have had any influence upon it: Makin v. Attorney-General
of New South Wales[93].

So overwhelming is the proof furnished by the
evidence not excepted to, that no honest jury could have returned other than a
verdict of guilty of obtaining money by false pretences had the conduct of the
case been entirely free from all the alleged errors of omission and commission.
No substantial wrong was occasioned on the trial of the fourth count, and the
conviction upon it, is in our opinion, unassailable.

Since we also concur in the view of the learned
Chief Justice of Manitoba that the punishment of the appellant should not
exceed the maximum penalty which might be imposed had the conviction been upon
the fourth count alone, the questions raised as to the first and second counts,
to use the language of counsel for the Crown, have become academic. We
therefore express no opinion upon them.

Appeal dismissed.

On Appeal
From the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.

Criminal law—Perjury—Form of
oath—Practice—Voire dire.

After examination on voire
dire, in a judicial proceeding, a person called as a witness (with the
assistance of an interpreter) went through a ceremony accepted as the taking of
an oath in the form usual with his race and class, knowing and intending that
his testimony should be received and acted upon as evidence given under oath.

Held, that on prosecution for perjury in giving his
testimony the witness could not set up the defence that he had not been duly
sworn. Rex v. Lai Ping (11 B.C. Rep. 102) ; The Queen's Case (2
Brod. & Bing. 284); Ofnychund v. Barker (1 Atk. 21); Attorney—General
v. Bradlaugh (14 Q.B.D. 667), and Curry v. The King (48 Can. S.C.R.
532), referred to.

Judgment appealed from (19
D.L.R: 313; 30 West. L.R. 65) affirmed.

APPEAL from the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the conviction of the appellant upon an
indictment for perjury.

The judgment appealed from was
rendered upon a case reserved at the trial by His Lordship Mr. Justice Gregory,
which was as follows:—

""1. The prisoner was tried
before me at the Vancouver Spring Assizes, on June 26th, 1914.

""2. The charge was that the
said Shajoo Ram on

[Page 393]

the 15th day of January, 1914,
whilst appearing as a witness, and after having been duly sworn before Charles
John South, Esq., then sitting as Deputy Police Magistrate in and for the City
of Vancouver, in a judicial proceeding wherein one Baboo Singh was charged with
having unlawfully broken a shop window, which magistrate had competent power
and authority to administer the oath to the said accused, as a witness in that
behalf, did then and there falsely, knowingly and corruptly swear and depose to
the effect following, that is to say, that he the said Shajoo Ram was not
present at a meeting at the Sikh Temple, Second Avenue, West, in the City of
Vancouver, on the night of Saturday, the 10th day of January, 1914, whereas in
truth and in fact the said Shajoo Ram was present at a meeting at the Sikh
Temple aforesaid, on the Saturday night aforesaid, as he the said Shajoo Ram
well knew when he so falsely and corruptly deposed as aforesaid, and the said
Shajoo Ram did thereby then and there commit wilful and corrupt perjury.

""3. There was no evidence
before me of the words (if any) that the magistrate put to the interpreter,
L.J. Ricketts, to be interpreted to the accused by way of administering an
oath. The magistrate was not called to give evidence.

""4. Counsel for the accused
consented to the admission of the transcript of the proceedings in the Police
Court as evidence that it was in the course a judicial proceeding that the
alleged perjury had been committed, but not as evidence that the accused had
been sworn.

""5. At the trial before me
Henry William Gwyther, a Hindu interpreter who was present in the proceedings
before Magistrate South, and L.J. Ricketts, who 

[Page 394]

acted as interpreter in the
proceedings in question, were the only witnesses called to prove that the
accused had been properly sworn in the Police Court proceedings. The evidence
of these two witnesses is made part of this case.

""6. The accused was called
on his own behalf at the trial before me and the following is the stenographic
report of what occurred when he was called upon to give evidence on his owen
behalf.

""Shajoo Ram, the accused,
called:—

""Interpreter: He is a
Guthric. He will affirm.

""Court: What is the custom?
How do you people swear ?

""Interpreter: He swears by
putting his hand up. It is like affirming.

""Court: All right.

""Accused sworn.

""7. At the close of the case
for the Crown counsel for the accused asked to have the case taken from the
jury on the ground that there was no evidence that the accused had been duly
sworn in the Police Court proceedings.

""8. I gave leave that an
application be made later for a stated case.

""9. I instructed the jury
that there was evidence that the accused had been duly sworn.

""10. The accused was found
guilty of the charge.

""11. On the application for
the stated case counsel for the accused asked that the evidence of the witness
Gwyther in the Police Court should be made part of the stated case. This
application I refused.

""12. However, I gave leave
that an appeal should be taken on this point.

""13. The questions submitted
are:—

[Page 395]

""1st. Was there evidence
that a proper oath had been administered to the accused in the Police Court
proceedings, in which perjury was alleged to have been committed, and was I
right in charging the jury that there was such evidence?

""2ndly. Was I right in
refusing the application of Counsel for the accused that the deposition of
Gwyther taken in the Police Court proceedings should form part of this case?""

By the judgment appealed from,
the conviction was affirmed, Irving J. dissenting.

W. L. Scott for the
appellant.

J. A. Ritchie for the
respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—This appeal
should be dismissed.

IDINGTON J.—I think this appeal
should be dismissed. Sufficient reasons are assigned therefor and appear in the
judgments of the court below and it seems needless to repeat them here.

DUFF J.—I think there was
evidence, meagre it is true, but still sufficient, to support a finding by the
jury that the accused, presenting himself as a witness in a court of justice,
and giving the answers he did give, on his examination, on the voire dire,
in effect declared that the ceremony which was accepted as the taking of an
oath was in fact binding on his conscience as an oath. It is probable that the
jury in reaching their conclusion assumed, as I think they were entitled to
assume, that the witness under-

[Page 396]

stood that he was going through
that which was the ordinary form of oath administered to persons of his race
and class in the courts of British
 Columbia, and of course generally
accepted as a form of oath binding on their consciences.

On the questions of law I am in
entire agreement with the view expressed by Mr. Justice Martin, in which Mr.
Justice McPhillips concurred, which view is concisely stated in the judgment of
the Chief Justice in the case of Rex v. Lai Ping[2],
in a passage which is quoted in the judgment of Mr. Justice Martin and is in
the following words:—

It seems to me that when a
man without objection takes the oath in the form ordinarily administered to
persons of his race or belief, as the case may be, he is then under a legal
obligation to speak the truth, and cannot be heard to say that he was not
sworn. If we were to decide otherwise we would deprive the evidence given in a
court of justice of the most powerful and necessary sanction which it is
possible to give it, namely, the risk of a prosecution for perjury.

In British Columbia, indeed, the
facts being as above mentioned the question would seem to be beyond controversy
by reason of the declaratory enactment of 1& 2 Vict, ch. 105, as follows:—

AN ACT TO REMOVE DOUBTS AS
TO THE VALIDITY OF CERTAIN OATHS.

Be it declared and enacted
by the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of
the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament
assembled, and by the authority of the same, that in all cases in which an oath
may lawfully be and shall have been administered to any person, either as a
juryman or a witness, or a deponent in any proceeding, civil or criminal, in
any court of law or equity in the United Kingdom, or on appointment to any
office or employment, or on any occasion whatever, such person is bound by the
oath administered, provided the same shall have been administered in such form
and with such ceremonies as such person may declare to be binding; and every
such person in case of wilful false swearing may be convicted of

[Page 397]

the crime of perjury in the
same manner as if the oath had been administered in the form and with the
ceremonies most commonly adopted.

Eighteen years before that
statute was passed, Abbott C.J., in the Queen's Case[3],
used these words:

I conceive, that, if a
witness says he considers the oath as binding upon his conscience, he does, in
effect affirm, that, in taking that oath, he has called his God to witness, * *
* and having done that, that it is perfectly unnecessary and irrelevant to ask
any further questions.

There seems to be no substance in
the objection that the oath was administered by the interpreter and not by the
magistrate. The interpreter was merely the mouthpiece of the judicial officer.

I think the appeal fails.

ANGLIN J.—The appellant was
admittedly capable of taking an oath. He was not a person authorized to make
affirmation under section 14 of the ""Canada Evidence Act ."" To sustain
his conviction for prejury under section 170  of the Criminal Code  it is
therefore necessary to shew that he told. what was known to him to be false as
part of his evidence upon oath in a judicial proceeding.

With Mr. Justice Galliher I
regret that greater care was not taken in the Police Court proceedings, when
the appellant was called as a witness, to make it certain that he fully
understood that he was about to give evidence under the sanction of an
invocation of the Deity (his Deity) as witness to his truthfulness. In whatever
form it may be administered, that is in English law the essence of an oath. Omychund
v.

[Page 398]

Barker[4]; Attorney-General v. Bradlaugh[5];
Curry v. The King[6],
at pages 534 and 535.

The evidence on the defendant's
trial for perjury fairly establishes that, before giving his testimony at the
Police Court, he solemnly promised with uplifted hand to tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth. That he said ""I swear,""
though probable, is uncertain. But he answered ""yes"" to the question:
""Is the oath you have taken binding on you?"" or, it may have been,
""binding on your conscience,"" or some equivalent term? (The
Queen's Case[7].)
It also appears that it is the custom of the people to whom the defendant
belongs to swear by putting up the hand; and he himself was so sworn when
giving evidence on his own behalf on his trial for perjury. Taking all these
circumstances into account it would seem to be a not unreasonable inference
that the defendant knew he was taking what was intended to be an oath— that his
purpose was to have the court believe that he was swearing to tell the truth
and by uplifting his hand to invoke the Deity as witness. On the whole, though
not entirely satisfied that the appellant did actually call upon the Deity to
witness his truthfulness, neither am I satisfied that he did not. I entertain
no doubt, however, that he gave his testimony with full knowledge that it
would, and with deliberate intent that it should, be received and acted upon as
evidence given under oath.

I am, for these reasons, not
prepared to dissent from the judgment affirming this conviction.

[Page 399]

BRODEUR J.—The appellant claims
that he has not been duly sworn and that he could not then be convicted of
perjury.

He is a Hindoo, and the evidence
shews that when he was sworn the interpreter did his best to convey to the mind
of the witness what he was bound to do as such. He volunteered to take the oath
by the uplifting of the hand.

As the Chief Justice said in Curry
v. The King[8]:—

Having taken the oath in
that form without objection it is an admission that the witness regarded it as
binding on his conscience.

I cannot see how the appellant
may claim to-day that he has not been duly sworn.

He was examined in this case
before the criminal court and there took the oath in the same way.

I am of opinion that if a witness
allows himself to be sworn in any form without objecting to it, he is liable to
be indicted for perjury, if his testimony prove false. Best on Evidence (10
ed.), page 151.

It would be a pity if perjurers
could escape on technicalities as the one which is raised in this case.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

On
Appeal from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.

Criminal law—Stated case—Extension
of time—Notice of appeal—Criminal Code , ss. 901 , 1014 , 1021 , 1022 , 1024 .

Where, on an application under
section 901  of the Criminal Code , the court, in the exercise of judicial
discretion, has refused to allow a postponement of the trial of the person
indicted, there can be no review of the decision by an appellate court and the
question presented does not constitute a question of law upon which there may
be a reserved case under the provisions of section 1014  of the Criminal Code .
Judgment appealed from (5 W.W.R. 1229; 26 West. L.R. 955) affirmed. The
Queen v. Charlesworth (1 B. & S. 460 ); Winsor v. The
Queen (L.R. 1Q.B. 390); Rex v. Lewis (78 L.J.K.B. 722); Rex
v. Blyth (19 Ont. L.R. 386); Reg. v. Johnson (2 C. &
K. 354); and Reg. v. Slavin (17 U.C.C.P. 205) referred to.

APPLICATION, on behalf of the
appellant, for extension of the time for giving notice, as required by section
1024  of the Criminal Code , of an appeal from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia[1],
whereby the conviction of the appellant upon an indictment for murder was
sustained, McPhillips J. dissenting.

[Page 588]

The circumstances in which the
application was made are stated in the judgments now reported.

Coté appeared in support of the application.

J. A. Ritchie contra.

IDINGTON J.—Unless we are
prepared to declare that it is arguable that it may be held to be law that a
prisoner has a legal right to insist upon postponement of his trial in any case
where some evidence to be adduced against him has been brought to the notice of
his counsel for the first time on the day of the trial, this motion must be
refused.

The proposed appeal here is based
upon the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice McPhillips, which in turn rests upon
facts which imply nothing more than I have stated. A good many more facts are
set forth therein, but none adding anything to the strength of the alleged
legal right, or interfering in any way with the discretion assigned the learned
trial judge in such case.

It would not be in the interests
of the administration of justice to grant an indulgence such as now asked to
permit of the presentation of such a case.

It may in some cases where like
indulgence may be asked not be so easy as here to grasp all that really is
involved in the proposed appeal.

The motion must be refused.

DUFF J.—After full consideration
of the circumstances I think the application ought not to be granted. The
question which counsel for the accused desires to raise upon appeal to this
court is the ques-

[Page 589]

tion whether the accused was
entitled to a traverse of the trial in the circumstances mentioned in the
reserved case. My opinion is that, in this respect, the case does not present a
question of law within section 1014  of the Criminal Code . I have reached this
conclusion after the most anxious consideration of the judgment given in the
court below in which the considerations in favour of the view that a question
of law is stated are set forth with great fullness and ability. I can only say
that, having come to a very clear conclusion that the appellant's appeal on
this point would be hopeless, and that being of the opinion of my learned
brothers, I think no possible object could be served by granting the
application.

The right to invoke the
jurisdiction of the courts by way of appeal from a conviction after a trial at
the assizes given by section 1014  of the Criminal Code  is a strictly limited
one. The Code does not contemplate that an accused person should be entitled as
of right to claim redress by way of appeal in every case in which it alleged
that the trial judge has made a mistake as, for instance, in respect of a
question which is left to his discretion; the appeal given is by way of case
stated and the case must present some question of law. In respect of cases not
falling within section 1014  or section 1021  a right is given by section 1022  to
apply to the Minister of Justice who has power to order a new trial.

ANGLIN J.—The defendant applies
to extend the time for service of notice of appeal to this court under section
1024  of the Criminal Code . The judgment of 

[Page 590]

the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming his conviction for murder was pronounced on the 27th of
January, 1914. He had the right to give notice of appeal within the fifteen
days thereafter which section 1024  allows. But, having permitted that time to
expire without giving notice, he now asks indulgence on the ground that he had
not until quite recently the means to launch or prosecute the appeal which he
desires to take. Before granting an extension of time to serve the notice it is
our duty to satisfy ourselves that the proposed appeal involves a question of
law which could be reserved under section 1014 of the Code and would properly form
the subject of an appeal to this court.

The learned trial judge reserved
three questions for the opinion of the Court of Appeal:—

(1) Whether the prisoner was
entitled to a traverse of the trial to the Spring Assizes.

(2) Whether the trial judge was
right in permitting counsel for the Crown to ask the accused when he was giving
evidence on his own behalf if he had been charged with or had committed certain
offences.

(3) Whether the trial judge was
right in permitting the accused to be cross-examined on his alleged testimony
at the inquest in the absence of the original depositions.

The Court of Appeal unanimously
answered the second and third questions in the affirmative; and it has been
decided in McIntosh v. The Queen[2],
that the right of appeal to this court is confined to questions upon which
there has been dissent in the provincial court of appeal. The defendant's right
of appeal

[Page 591]

is, therefore, restricted to the
first question. Three of the five judges of the provincial court of appeal held
that this was not a question of law which might be reserved under section 1014 ,
and four of them that, if it were, it should be answered in the negative. Mr.
Justice McPhillips dissented from the opinion of the majority on both grounds[3].

Section 901  of the Criminal Code 
declares that

no person prosecuted shall
be entitled as of right to traverse or postpone the trial of any indictment
preferred against him in any court.

By sub-section 2, power is
conferred on every trial court, in its discretion, to grant an adjournment of
trial to any prisoner.

The grand jury indicted the
defendant, on the 13th of October, 1913[4]. On
that day he was assigned counsel, who was informed that the Crown proposed to
call two witnesses whose names were on the indictment, but who had not given
evidence at the preliminary investigation. A copy of the memorandum purporting
to state the substance of the testimony which these witnesses were expected to
give was also furnished him. There is no doubt that this evidence was of vital
importance and disclosed facts not stated at the preliminary investigation.
Counsel for the prisoner moved to traverse the trial in order to have an
opportunity to

inquire into the antecedents
(of these witnesses) and the reason their evidence had not been given at the
preliminary investigation and was being now given,

and on other general grounds. The
Crown opposed postponement because of the expense involved and the great danger
of loss of material evidence. The court

[Page 592]

offered to transfer the case to
the Vernon Assizes to be held a fortnight later. Counsel for the defence
declined to accept this offer, saying it would be useless to him, and the trial
proceeded, on the 16th October, resulting in the defendant being convicted of
murder.

While it is possible to conceive
of cases in which it would be clear that there had not been any exercise of
judicial discretion in granting or refusing postponement of trial, and in such
cases there might be error of law which would be properly reviewable, where, in
what was clearly an exercise of his discretion, the trial judge has refused a
postponement because he was ""of the opinion"" that further time should
not be allowed (sec. 901 , sub-sec. 2 (Crim. Code)), I am satisfied that the
propriety of that exercise of discretion is not reviewable by an appellate
court and is not properly the subject of a reserved case under section 1014 .
The principle which underlies the decisions in The Queen V. Charlesworth[5],
and Winsor v. The Queen[6],
approved in Rex v. Lewis[7],
applies. I am, with respect, unable to appreciate the distinction which it is
suggested exists between the discretion conferred where ""the matter rests
in the opinion of the court""[8], and
this case where the court is empowered to postpone, if it ""is of the
opinion"" that it should do so.

If the propriety of the refusal
of the postponement is a question of law (Rex v. Blyth[9],
pp. 389, 392, re-reviewable under section 1014  et seq. of the Criminal
Code , I agree with Martin J.A. and Irving J.A. that, under the circumstances of
the present case, interference by an appellate court would be out of the
question. Reg. v. Johnson[10];
Reg. v. Slavin[11].

[Page 593]

I am, for these reasons, of the
opinion that the extension of time asked for must be refused.

BRODEUR J.—By the provisions of article
1024  of the Criminal Code  there is an appeal to this court by any person
convicted of any indictable offence if the court of appeal has not been
unanimous. But notice of appeal should be served on the Attorney-General within
fifteen days after the judgment appealed from has been rendered. However, this
court or a judge thereof may extend the time within which the notice of appeal
should be given.

The object of the present
application is to obtain that extension.

The applicant has been convicted
of murder in the month of October last. He was, by the sentence of the court,
to be executed on the 29th of December last. On the 23rd of December, just a
few days before the date fixed for the execution, his counsel applied for a
reserved case and a reprieve was granted until the 30th day of January. The
Court of Appeal rendered its judgment on the 27th of January last. The
execution of sentence was postponed until the 4th of April, 1914.

Instead of giving notice of
appeal to this court, as required by law, the applicant waited until the 17th
of March to apply for an order extending the time for serving upon the Attorney—General
of the province the notice of appeal.

I have gone into the merits of
the case in order to satisfy myself as to whether the case presented some
serious doubts, and I failed to see any good reason why we should grant the
delay asked for. 

[Page 594]

The only point of importance
which was reserved by the trial judge and about which there was a dissenting
opinion in the Court of Appeal was whether the trial judge had exercised a
proper discretion in refusing to postpone the trial to the Spring Assizes.

It was not established that the
ends of justice would have been served by postponing the trial to the Spring
Assizes. On the contrary, it was to be feared that the witnesses could not be
procured at the future time at which it was prayed to put off the trial.

The witnesses about whom the
prisoner wanted to have some information were well known to him, had been in
relation with him for some time, and he knew of the antecedents of those
witnesses.

It has been stated in Rex v.
Jones, in 1806[12], that
it is the constant practice of the Old Bailey not to put off trials for the
absence of witnesses to character only.

For those reasons the present
application now made to this court should be dismissed.

Application refused.

Criminal law—Habeas corpus—Common
law offences—Construction of statute—""Supreme Court Act,"" R.S.O.,
1906, c. 139, s. 62—Jurisdiction of Supreme Court judges.

The jurisdiction of judges of
the Supreme Court of Canada in respect of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum
extends only to cases of commitment on charges of offences which are criminal
by virtue of statutes enacted by the Parliament of Canada; it does not extend
to cases of commitment for offences at common law or under statutes enacted
prior to Confederation which are still in force. Re Sproule (12 Can. S.C.R.
140) referred to.

The offence of housebreaking
as described in the Imperial statute, 7 & 8 Geo. IV., ch. 29, sec. 15,
became part of the criminal law of British Columbia on the introduction of the
criminal law of England into that colony by the Ordinance of 19th November,
1858, continued to be so until the Union of the province with Canada, and since
then by virtue of sec. 11 of the ""Criminal Code ,"" and it is not an
offence to' which sec. 62 of the ""Supreme Court Act,"" R.S.'C., 1906,
ch. 139, has application.

APPLICATION, in Supreme Court
Chambers, at the City of Ottawa, for the rule calling upon the keeper of the
common gaol in the County of Westminster, at the City of New Westminster, in
British Columbia, to show cause why a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum
should not issue to bring up the body of one Charles Dean who was, as alleged,
confined in the said gaol under a warrant of commitment, dated 5th September,
1912, to stand his trial upon a charge of the offence of housebreaking.

J. Travers Lewis K.C. supported the application.

[Page 236]

E. F. B. Johnston K.C. on behalf of the Attorney-General for British Columbia, showed cause.

DUFF J.—I think I have no
jurisdiction to entertain this application. It will not be necessary, in view
of my opinion as to the construction of section 62 of the ""Supreme Court
Act,"" to decide the point raised by the contention of Mr. Johnston, on
behalf of the Attorney-General for British
 Columbia, that that enactment is beyond
the competence of the Parliament of Canada. Section 62 is as follows:—

Every judge of the court
shall, except in matters arising out of any claim for extradition under any
treaty, have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several
provinces to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum for the
purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under
any Act of the Parliament of 'Canada.

2. If the judge refuses the
writ or remands the prisoner, an appeal shall lie to the court.

The language indicates an
intention on the part of Parliament to confer only a strictly limited
jurisdiction. Anything like frequent interposition in the administration of the
criminal law in the provinces by the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada,
through the instrumentality of the writ of habeas corpus, would obviously
lead to the most undesirable results ; and, before exercising the authority in
a given case, I think it is my duty to scrutinize most carefully the terms in
which that authority is given to ascertain whether or not the case is clearly
one of those in which it was intended to be exercised.

The jurisdiction extends only, I
think, to those cases in which the ""commitment"" has followed upon a
charge of a criminal offence which is a criminal offence by virtue of some
statutory enactment of the Parliament of Canada; it does not, in my opinion, ex-

[Page 237]

tend to cases in which the
""commitment"" is for an offence which was an offence at common law or
under a statute which was passed prior to Confederation and is still in force.

That, I think, is the effect of previous
decisions by judges of this court. See Re Sproule[1].
The offence for which the applicant was committed to stand his trial is thus
described in the warrant of commitment:

He, the said 'Charles Dean,
at the City of New Westminster, in the County of Westminster, on the 15th day
of September, A.D. 1911, did unlawfully break and enter the counting-house of
the Bank of Montreal, situated at the corner of Columbia and Church streets, in
the City of New Westminster aforesaid, and the sum of $271,000, the property of
the said Bank of Montreal, then and there being found therein then and there
steal, contrary to the 'form of the statute in such case made and provided.

These words aptly describe an
offence under section 15 of 7 & 8 Geo. IV. ch. 29, which became part of the
law of British Columbia under the ordinance of the 19th November, 1858,
introducing the civil and criminal law of England into that colony. This
enactment continued to be a part of the criminal law of British Columbia down
to the time of the Union with Canada, and, by section 11 of the ""Criminal
Code "" it is now part of the ""criminal law"" of the province in so
far as it has not been repealed, ""altered, varied, modified or
affected"" by competent legislative authority. The only change relates to
the nature of the punishment to which an offender is liable.

Section 62 has, consequently, no
application.

Application refused.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA.

Criminal law—Indictment for
murder—Trial—Charge to jury—Misdirection—Constructive murder—Natural
consequence of act—New trial.

On the trial of an indictment for murder of
one Kenneth Lea it was proved that the prisoners, who had been drinking, came
on the deceased’s lawn and commenced to shout and sing and use profane and
insulting language towards him. He twice warned them away, and finally appeared
with a loaded gun threatening to shoot. A rush was made towards the verandah
where he stood, when he took hold of the barrel of the gun and struck one of
the prisoners with the stock. The gun was discharged into his body and there
was evidence that the prisoners then maltreated him and his wife. He was taken
to a hospital in Halifax where he died shortly after. The trial judge in
charging the jury instructed them that the prisoners were doing an unlawful act
in trespassing on the property of deceased and that if they were actuated by
malice it would be murder, if not it was manslaughter, drawing their attention
especially to sections 256  and 259 (b) of the Criminal Code . The
prisoners were found guilty of murder. On appeal from the decision of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on a reserved case:—

Held, that the
above direction to the jury ignored the requirements of the Code formulated in
sub-section (d) of section 259 , to which the Judge should also have
drawn their attention directing them to find whether or not the prisoners knew,
or ought to have known, that
their acts were likely to cause death, and his failure to do so left his charge
open to objection and constituted misdirection for which the prisoners were
entitled to a new trial.

APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia, affirming, on a case reserved, by an

[Page 569]

equal division of opinion, the conviction of
the appellants for murder.

Under the circumstances set out in the above
head-note the appellants were found guilty of the murder of Kenneth Lea at
Wolfville, N.S. The prisoner’s counsel then presented to the trial judge
thirty-six objections to the charge and verdict and asked him to reserve a case
for consideration to the full court, which he refused to do. On application to
the full court he was ordered to reserve a case on thirty-two of the objections[1], and after argument on the case so reserved
the court was equally divided and the conviction stood. The prisoners then
appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Roscoe K.C. for
the appellants. In a criminal case it is not necessary that evidence should be
objected to. Reg. v. Gibson[2];
Rex v. Brooks[3]; Rex
v. Farrell[4]. The
rule in civil cases does not apply to criminal cases, Reg. v.
Thériault[5].

When it he facts render it necessary, in
order to guide the jury, that a direction on law should be given, want of
direction on the point of law is ground for a new trial. Prudential
Assurance Co. v. Edmonds[6];
Hawkins v. Snow[7]; Rex
v. Blythe[8]. The
chief defect in the judge’s charge is the weight attached to the illegal
presence of the appellants on the lands of deceased.

The term “malice,” when used, should be
defined to the jury. Richardson v. The State[9]. The judge

[Page 570]

charged that if the jury found that the
appellants were actuated by malice and ill-will in going to Lea’s premises, and
behaving as they did, even though they did not intend to injure him, the crime
was murder. The words and actions of drunken men, as indicative of malice,
should be differentiated from those of a sober man. The People v. Rogers[10]; Rex v. Thomas[11].

Failure to instruct upon the distinction
between murder and manslaughter is also the proper subject of reservation. Rex
v. Wong On[12];
Rex v. Wallcem[13]. Any
point submitted by the judge to the jury should be considered as materially
affecting the conviction. The Crown must shew affirmatively that the
misdirection did not influence the result. Allen v. The King[14].

Newcombe K.C. for
the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia discussed the evidence in regard to the res
gestœ, and referred to 1 Hawk. P.C. (Ker ed.), page 86, para. 10; page 513,
and page 99, paras. 41, 42; Bishop Crim. Law (8 ed.), pages 534, 535, 654, 858;

v. Barnard[15]; 1
Russell on Crimes, 879; 1 East P.C. 225; Reg. v. Martin[16].

Roscoe K.C. for
the appellants.

Davies J. agreed with Anglin J.

[Page 571]

Idington J.—The appellants were convicted of murder as result of a trial by the
learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia and a jury.

Their counsel took some thirty-six objections to
the learned judge’s charge to the jury, asked for a reserved case thereon and
being refused, appealed to the court en banc, which directed the learned
Chief Justice to state a case as to thirty-two of the grounds for these
objections. The result was that in disposing of his statement of case framed as
thus directed the court was equally divided and hence this appeal.

Of these thirty-four alleged points of law I may
say that the great majority of them are in law without foundation. In the
result reached by this court it is needless to shew why I have come to such
conclusion or to say more about all of them than this: With the one exception I
am about to deal with, and a few other instances in which the remarks objected
to may have a bearing more or less direct on that one point, it seems to me
these points would never have been directed to be stated or upheld if due
regard had been had to the curative provisions governing criminal appeals. I
have selected that point on which Mr. Justice Drysdale put his finger as
containing the pith of all that was objectionable and which I find so well
founded as to entitle appellants to a new trial. That objection is No. 28,
stated as follows:—

28. Whether the law applicable to the case
was stated sufficiently to enable the jury to determine whether if the
defendants were guilty of homicide such homicide was murder, and the facts
applicable to such law pointed out.

I think the first question we must ask ourselves
in all criminal appeals where the objections taken are well founded or
arguable, is whether or not we can say

[Page 572]

that in our “opinion some substantial wrong or
miscarriage was occasioned thereby at the trial.”

I am not disposed to interpret this statutory
duty in any narrow metaphysical sense, for if we did so we might frame a
judgment in every case of mistake no matter how trivial so as to demonstrate
that there might have been somebody in the jury panel that might have taken
another view of the matter if this supposed error had not taken place.

I think this and every other appellate court
acting under our Criminal Code  must grasp the matter presented with a strong
hand and not allow the trivial error to lead them into the land of speculation
founded on some shade of possibility.

We must see, however, that the trial has been
one of the legal offence charged.

We must also, I submit, assume that the jurors
have brought to the subject dealt with that close attention to what has taken
place in the course of the trial and that strong common sense what would enable
them in light thereof to apprehend the language of the learned trial judge in
charging them, and in many instances mentally, and automatically as it were,
correct the accidental slips of the tongue the most careful judge may chance to
make.

In this case we have illustrations in many of
the objections made of how this should work out. The learned Chief Justice, it
appears, used expressions which, isolated, and read without having regard to
the evidence and general scope of his charge, might be held to be misdirection,
partly of law and partly relative to fact, but which ought not to lead astray
or be supposed to have led astray any intelligent jury acting in the spirit
which, I submit, should be presumed to have governed them.

[Page 573]

The general outline of the evidence herein was
so clear and simple that properly marshalled there should not have been any
misapprehension in this regard of the duties such evidence had cast upon the
jury in this case. Simple as the case in this regard is there happened to be
two phases of the problem to be solved which were not kept as clearly separated
throughout as they might have been, and there is thus the greater difficulty in
escaping from the conclusion I have reached, or of applying the curative
provision I have referred to.

Briefly put the facts in outline as presented
for the prosecution were that on a Sunday afternoon the appellants, who had
been drinking, carried one or more bottles of liquor with them, drank more, and
when thus in an intoxicated condition in front of deceased’s premises stopped
and trespassed on his lawn. There they used grossly offensive language and
though asked by deceased to retire, refused. The deceased and his wife and
others who had been on the verandah, withdrew into the house or outbuildings.

The appellants remained on the lawn, or on the
highway, continuing their unseemly conduct. The deceased after a time loaded
his gun and proceeded therewith to the verandah in front of his house. The
appellants gave evidence on their own behalf, and it was said by one or more of
them that deceased asked them to go away or he would shoot them. They do not
pretend that he ever came from his position on the verandah, which was
fifty-six feet distant from the highway where they say they then were. The wife
of deceased heard a rush of feet on the walk up to the verandah where deceased
stood and immediately thereafter an explosion of a gun. It seems tolerably
clear that the gun

[Page 574]

had been used as a club by deceased in resisting
the onset of one or all of these appellants, and in the result an explosion of
the loaded gun lodged its contents in the upper part of the thigh of deceased,
from the ultimate effects of which, I assume for the present, he died, whether
necessarily so if not further ill treated, might form another question. A hole
was found in the screen front door of the dwelling and a bottle, or remains of
one, were, immediately after this, found in the screen front-door of the
dwelling and a other facts and especially the possession of a bottle or bottles
by appellants, left ground for inference I need not dwell upon.

The wife of deceased rushed out and found all
three appellants on the verandah or steps therefrom.

Up to this rush from the highway or lawn,
whichever was the place they are supposed to have rushed from, there was not
anything which took place that in law could properly be held as provocation so
rousing the passions of appellants as to reduce the gravity of the offence, if
any, committed by the appellants, or any of them, to manslaughter.

The charge, I respectfully submit, rather
confuses thought in not restricting this question of manslaughter to be dealt
with in treating of the later phase of the case and including there the whole.

The evidence warrants the inference that the
appellants had unlawfully come to attack the deceased and as the charge puts it
that he resisting or anticipating it, struck the foremost of them violently on
the head with the butt end of the gun and thereby produced the explosion. But
there are other possible inferences as to the exact cause of the explosion
quite as much within the range of the consideration of the

[Page 575]

struggle and its consequences. It may be
possible to consider any of these and yet the result of guilt or innocence be
open to a jury, Now all the errors, if any, in the learned judge’s charge
bearing only upon the evidence or its application so far, I count as nothing
that need concern us.

Let it be assumed for argument’s sake that the
attack made or threatened by appellants or any of them was intended to be only
an assault, the question arises whether or not the consequence which followed
can be made the basis of a charge for murder.

The learned Chief Justice charged as follows:—

Although, they could not have contemplated
that the gun would be discharged as the result of their action, yet, as in the
result it did they would be responsible for it and it would constitute the
crime of manslaughter provided there was no malice on their part in doing what
they did. On the other hand, if a party while engaged in the commission of a
felony kills another it becomes murder and not manslaughter. What is meant by
that is this: Suppose these men had come there at night for the purpose of committing
burglary and in the course of the commission of that act Mr. Lea had been
killed, that would be murder because they then would have been there committing
a felony. * * *

I will next draw your attention to the law
bearing upon one of the most important features of the case. There is a common
idea, or I have heard it said, that because Mr. Lea held in his own hand the
gun the discharge of which inflicted the wound which proximately contributed to
his death, the accused are not responsible for that part of the affray. I have
heard—and probably you have—that they did not shoot him. It would be a sorry
business if that were the law. It would be absurd if such were the law. They
are responsible if they caused Mr. Lea to do the act which resulted in the’
discharge of the gun as much as if they seized the gun and discharged it into
him. Did they rush at him with the intention of assaulting him and did Mr. Lea
then use his gun? If so they are as responsible as if they seized the gun and
discharged it into him. “A person may be responsible for the death of another
either as-murder or manslaughter, provided it was caused by his unlawful act
resulting in corporal injury.” The unlawful act here, as I have pointed out,
would be the men assembling in a disorderly way, and trespassing on Mr. Lea’s
property and refusing to go away when asked.

[Page 576]

Now, on the facts I have outlined and bearing in mind the law to be applied, I think this charge misapprehended that
law and consequently misdirected the jury.

The foundation of the law is in section 252 of
the Code defining culpable homicide, and can be properly referred to as aiding
any one to understand and interpret the later sections.

When we want to find the definition of the
specific offence of murder applied and that applicable to this case, we must
look to section 259 of which sub-sections (b) and (d) are
as follows:—

(b) If the offender means to cause
to the person killed any bodily injury which is known to the offender to be
likely to cause death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not;

* * * * *

(d) If the offender, for any
unlawful object, does an act which he knows or ought to have known to be likely
to cause death, and thereby kills any person, though he may have desired that
his object should be effected without hurting anyone.

I refer to sub-section (b) because the learned Chief Justice
says he read that sub-section to the jury, but he does not seem to have read or
at all referred to and explained sub-section (d). With the
greatest respect, I must hold this
omission was misdirection.

I do not think as at present advised the evidence in this case
warranted much reliance being placed on sub-section (b). I need not elaborate. Let any one
consider the facts and read this sub-section and see how ill fitted they are to
that sub-section.

I think sub-section (d) was that to which attention should have
been called and its meaning, which is not clear to those ignorant of the
history of the law, should have been expounded to the jury in such clear terms
that they would understand the ground upon which they ought to have proceeded.

[Page 577]

If the evidence would not warrant a conviction
on this section, then it would be our manifest duty to say so and set the
verdict aside on that ground alone.

I do not, however, so hold, but on the contrary
think and hold there was evidence which would warrant the jury in finding
thereupon a verdict of murder, resting it on this sub-section (d).

It is to that sub-section, I submit, the learned
Chief Justice ought to have addressed himself in all he said relative to death
resulting from the pursuit of an unlawful object and the bearing thereof on the
charge of murder.

There are other specific unlawful purposes as in
section 260 not appropriate to the peculiar facts in this case.

His general remarks as to the pursuit of an
unlawful object do not seem to me to exactly fit the case. The unlawful,
uncalled for and utterly unjustifiable attack on a man with a loaded gun in his
hands was liable to produce a scuffle resulting as this did in the death of
some one. The person or persons making the attack must according to their
evidence for the defence, have known the gun was likely to be in a loaded
condition and liable to explode as it did, and so result. This or something
like it was what I conceive was quite competent for the jury to have adopted as
a mode of reasoning to found a verdict of murder upon such facts as were
presented. I am not to be taken here as doing more than illustrate a possible
line of thought and by no means determining the legal result.

The learned Chief Justice did refer to a number
of analogous cases. But each case in a matter of this kind must stand upon its
own bottom. In applying these precedents, or rather as it seems to me this
subsection

[Page 578]

substituted as codification of the law touching
such like cases, the measure of its utility and reasonable application in any
case must abide the judgment of the jury.

No one can in all that branch of the law of
homicide anticipate or do more than see that the jury are so fully and
accurately instructed that they can intelligently address-themselves to the
task set before them by the law in said sub-section (d).

Theirs is the responsibility when once so
instructed. Their understanding of the evidence within the scope of such
instructions and application thereof is alone the limit of the practicable
operation of the law that must determine the fate of the accused in any such
case. In the absence of proper legal instructions in regard thereto there was
no legal trial of the real issue of murder. Hence there was no possibility of
applying the curative provision I have referred to.

Much was said of malice which is aside from the
true issue presented here.

The doing an unlawful act or rather the pursuing
an unlawful object carries with it the implication of malice in all the
consequences thereof so far as the sub-section may reach.

I am by no means to be understood as implying
thereby that evidence of hate or ill will external to that so implied or the
operation of such other malice upon the mind of one pursuing an unlawful object
is to be discarded. The existence of such and the possible influence it may
have had on the conduct of one pursuing any unlawful object may be of value in
helping those having to reach a conclusion in such a complex case.

But I repeat it is not an essential of the
evidence

[Page 579]

which may otherwise and independently thereof
point to a conclusion of guilt.

I purposely omitted above all reference to
evidence of the treatment meted out by the accused to the deceased after the
explosion of the gun, for it seems to my mind we can by separating the two
phases of the case the more clearly reach a proper conception of the law which
must govern the case so far as the charge of murder resting upon the explosion
of the gun is concerned.

I am not to be understood, however, as by any
means holding that the evidence of such later action is to be discarded as not
having any proper place for consideration in connection therewith. It may or
may not shed light, but only, as I have suggested regarding evidence of hate or
ill will, have a value in enabling a proper estimate to be made of the whole
conduct of the parties and of their responsibility in the way of holding they
ought to have known regarding the reasonably possible result of their conduct
under the circumstances.

It is the basis also herein of the other phase
of the case relative to the charge of murder and for that should be given
separate consideration.

If there is any ground for the charge that
thereby the death of the wounded man was accelerated this branch of the
evidence touches directly upon that and it is in that connection alone that
there was ground for referring to provocation resting on the severe wound the
blow with the gun had inflicted on one of the assailants.

I do not see misdirection in what was said in
that regard and need not dwell thereupon, but simply say that it would be
better understood by distinct and

[Page 580]

separate treatment in any charge in such a view
of the case.

The questions relative to manslaughter need not
be dwelt upon, but allowed to remain for the future

trial and take their proper place in any future
charge. I think the appeal must be allowed and a new

trial be had.

Duff J. agreed with Anglin J.

Anglin J.—In this case I am to deliver the judgment of my brothers Davies,
Duff and Brodeur as well as myself.

With very great respect for the learned Chief
Justice who tried this case, a close study of his charge, which we have read
and re-read, has driven us to the conclusion that he misdirected the jury in
regard to what, under the circumstances of this case, it was essential that
they should find in order to warrant a verdict of murder. He not only failed to
bring to their attention at least one inference of fact which it was necessary
that they should draw, but his charge, read as a whole, was tantamount to a
direction that they might assume that fact— that they might properly bring in a
verdict of murder without passing upon it.

The Crown charged the prisoners with murder (a)
because they did certain unlawful acts which caused the deceased to do an
act that resulted in his inflicting upon himself a gun-shot wound from which he
died; and (b) because by their subsequent brutal treatment of him they
accelerated his death. Both aspects of the case were presented to the jury. It
is impossible to know whether their verdict of murder

[Page 581]

was based upon both grounds or upon only one of
them; and, if upon one only, it is impossible to know upon which. Misdirection
as to the essential constituents of the crime of murder upon either aspect of
the case would, therefore, amount to such a substantial wrong or miscarriage
that it would entitle the defendants to a new trial, although the case had been
properly presented upon its other aspect. Having reached the conclusion that
there was such misdirection in connection with the degree of responsibility of
the defendants for the infliction of the gun-shot wound which caused the death
of Mr. Lea on the assumption that his death was not accelerated by what was
afterwards done by them, but happened when it did solely as a result of the
wound, we deal with the case as if there had been no subsequent ill-treatment
of the deceased by the accused.

By section 252(2) of the Criminal Code  it is
provided that,

Homicide is culpable when it consists of
the killing of any person * * * by causing a person by threats or fear of
violence or by deception to do an act which causes that person’s death * * *

There is no evidence upon which it could be
found that the acts of the deceased in “clubbing” his gun and striking Fred
Graves over the head with its stock were the result of physical force or
compulsion on the part of the defendants. These acts were, physically at all
events, the acts of the deceased himself. Upon the evidence they were the
immediate cause of his receiving the gun-shot wound from which he died. In
order that responsibility for that result should rest upon the defendants so as
to make them guilty of culpable homicide under section 252, it was necessary

[Page 582]

that the jury should find that such acts of the
deceased were caused, i.e., induced, “by threats or fear of violence, or
by deception.” There was here no suggestion of deception; but there were facts
from which a jury might infer, if properly instructed, that the deceased acted
through fear of violence on the part of the accused. Yet, although the learned
Chief Justice read to the jury other portions of section 252, he entirely
omitted to direct their attention to the vital provisions of sub-section 2
above quoted. He neither stated their effect to them, nor, as Mr. Justice
Graham points out, did he give them any direction from which they should have
gathered that they must find that the “clubbing” of the gun by the deceased and
striking Fred Graves upon the head with it were acts induced by fear of
violence. That was in itself a serious non-direction, which might amount to
such a substantial wrong or miscarriage as would necessitate a new trial. But
we do not dwell further upon it because there appear to be even more serious
objections to those portions of the charge in which the learned Chief Justice
directs the jury as to the facts they must find and the inferences which they
must draw in order that what may have been culpable homicide on the part of the
accused should amount to the crime of murder.

Without determining that the definition
contained in sections 259  and 260  of the Criminal Code  is exhaustive, under the
circumstances of the present case it was, in our opinion, necessary for the Crown
to establish and for the jury to find, in order to warrant a verdict of murder,
such facts as would constitute that crime under clause (d) of
section 259 , read with sub-section 2 of section 252 .

[Page 583]

259. Culpable homicide is murder.

* * * * *

(d) If the offender, for an
unlawful object, does an act which he knows or ought to have known to be likely
to cause death, and thereby kills any person, though he may have desired that
his object should be effected without hurting any one.

For the purposes of this appeal I assume that
under this provision it was not necessary, in order to bring the charge of
culpable homicide within it, that the jury should have found that the acts of
the defendants were such as they knew or should have known were likely to cause
the very acts to be done or the precise situation to arise which in fact
resulted in the homicide, or to cause the death of the person who was killed,
but that it would suffice if the jury had found that the accused did an act
which they knew or should have known would be likely to induce the doing of
anything or to bring about any situation likely to cause the death of some
person—the person killed or any other person. That construction of section
259(2) is the least favourable to the accused.

There was no suggestion that the defendants
meant to cause the death of Mr. Lea or to cause him any bodily injury likely to
cause his death. The evidence would not support such a finding. Yet the learned
Chief Justice read to the jury clause (b) of section 259 ; but he neither
read clause (d) nor stated its effect; nor does his charge
contain any equivalent statement of the law. It was assumed that the acts of
the accused, which, it was charged, had led to the deceased clubbing his gun
and striking Fred Graves with the stock, were done for an unlawful object. But
the jury were not instructed that before convicting of murder they must find
not merely that the conduct of the accused had in fact led to the doing of that

[Page 584]

which resulted in death, but also that the
accused knew or ought to have known that their acts were likely to cause
death—to lead to the deceased so handling or using the gun that some person
would probably be killed— that this was under the circumstances such a natural
or probable consequence of their conduct that the defendants should have
anticipated it. On the contrary the learned Chief Justice told them distinctly
and repeatedly that if in doing what they did the defendants were actuated by
spite or ill will towards Mr. Lea they should be found guilty of murder. I
quote some of the passages in which this view was impressed on the jury.

Early in the charge, after reading section 259  (b)
to the jury, the learned judge says:—

If a man goes on the property of another as
a mere trespasser, and in the course of such trespass commits an assault or
anything of that kind upon the owner of the property and death results,
although he may have had no malice, if he is there unlawfully, he is guilty of
manslaughter. If, on the other hand, he went there with some wicked purpose or
with the intention of committing a felony it would be murder. That is the
distinction that the law draws between the two offences. The rule that will
reduce the crime of killing another from murder to manslaughter is the absence
of malice or ill-feeling towards the deceased. If there was no malice or
ill-will the crime would be manslaughter. If the evidence satisfies you that
the accused, although not intending to kill the deceased, in what they did,
were actuated by malice and ill-will in what they did and that his death
resulted as a consequence of their unlawful conduct it will be murder and not
manslaughter.

A few lines lower down he says:—

They are responsible if they caused Mr. Lea
to do the act which resulted in the discharge of the gun, as much as if they
seized the gun and discharged it into him.

A little earlier he had said:—

Although they could not have contemplated
that the gun would be discharged as the result of their action, yet, as in the
result it did they would be responsible for it and it would constitute the
crime of manslaughter provided there was no malice on their part in doing what
they did.

[Page 585]

Further on he says:—

Now, as I said before, you must judge their
motives from their conduct, whether they were actuated by malice, spite and ill
will in this inhuman treatment of Mr. Lea. Does the evidence satisfy you that
in acting and behaving there as they did they were gratifying an old grudge
that they bore towards Mr. Lea. If you find that they were actuated by malice
and ill will in going there and behaving as they did, even though they did not
intend to injure him, the crime is murder.

Towards the close of the charge we find the
following passage:—

Now, just a few words in conclusion. I have
explained to you as fully as I could, the difference between murder and
manslaughter. I have told you that if you believe these men were actuated by
ill will or malice towards Mr. Lea and did what has been detailed here, that
would be murder, and that all of them should be found guilty. On the other
hand, if you think that there was no such ill feeling, that it was a mere
fracas, without previous ill feeling, then your verdict should be manslaughter.
I have called your attention to the various witnesses who have come here and
testified to different expressions of ill will towards Mr. Lea. and you have
heard the expressions that they used on this occasion. You must weigh these. If
you believe them it is evidence of malice and it is for you to consider them.

The jury subsequently returned to court and
requested directions on the subject of malice. The notes of the ensuing
proceedings are in part as follows:—

I thought I had defined that fully. “Malice”
is where a man has ill-will towards another—any kind of wicked feeling towards
his neighbour. If you come to the conclusion that what these men did resulted
from hatred or dislike or ill-will that would make it murder. If there is
evidence to satisfy you that these men were influenced by spite or ill-will,
that with the other facts would constitute murder. But you must not find them
guilty of murder unless you are satisfied from the evidence that they had a
grudge, or spite, or ill-will against Mr. Lea.

A juryman asked for further directions as to
premeditated murder and malice.

The Court: Premeditated murder would be an agreement to commit murder before
they went there. There is not the slightest evidence of that. But if the grudge
was there and they went there

[Page 586]

without any premeditated intention, if
their acts were induced through ill-feeling that would constitute murder. If
you are satisfied that what they did was not done through ill-will that would
be manslaughter.

A Juryman:
Then we do not need premeditation; all we need is malice?

The Court: All you need is malice.

A juryman asked for further instructions as to
the distinction between murder and manslaughter.

The Court: It is enough if they did the acts with malicious intent. If in
carrying out the acts that they did after they got there there was malice, that
would be malice sufficient to constitute murder.

* * * * *

If after they got there they were carrying
out a grudge, if they had it, it constitutes murder.

A Juryman:
If they had malice, it is as bad as if they had premeditation.

The Court: Yes.

A Juryman:
Would they have to have that malice at the time he was shot?

The Court: Yes, they would have to have the malice at the time. If they had
these malicious feelings or this antipathy towards the deceased, it must have
existed at the time they did what caused his death, even though they had no
intention of doing it before they went there. You must gather the existence or
non-existence of malice from what they did at the time. You must take into
consideration the threats made beforehand, although I do not know what value
you would put on them to shew bad feeling towards Mr. Lea.

A Juryman:
Is it necessary to prove that just before the crime was committed— a few
minutes before— they bad malice.

The Court: What I have told you is that if there was malice you can gather it
from the facts of the whole transaction. If you think from the facts proved
that they had this ill feeling during the time that they were doing the
injuries, then it was malice.

(The jury then retired.)

When the jury next returned to the court room it
was to deliver their verdict of guilty of murder.

The vital distinction— that, while, to sustain a
charge of manslaughter, it would suffice that the acts of the accused, whatever
their character, should in fact have aroused in the mind of the deceased a fear

[Page 587]

of violence which induced him to do that which
resulted in his death (section 252 (2)), in order that that culpable homicide
should amount to murder those acts of the accused must have been such that they
knew or should have known that the death of some person would be likely to be
caused by them (section 259 (d))—was not brought to the attention of the
jury. Whether the acts of the accused were of that character it was for the
jury to determine; and the inference which they should draw would depend to a
great extent upon whether in their opinion the accused knew or ought to have
known that the gun in the hands of the deceased was loaded and whether they
knew or should have known that their acts would be likely to lead to the
deceased making some use of it which would be likely to cause death. Upon
neither point can it be said that, under the circumstances disclosed in the
evidence, a conclusion in favour of the Crown was so necessary that no
reasonable man could have found otherwise. Indeed, the learned Chief Justice
appears to have gathered the impression from the evidence that the deceased
produced his gun not to shoot with it, but merely to frighten the accused. May
not they have had the same idea; and, if so, may they not have thought that the
gun was not loaded? Again, there is no evidence whether the deceased clubbed
the gun before or after the accused are supposed to have rushed at him. If
before, may not that act have led them to think that a gun so handled was not
loaded? Can it be said that the use of the gun by the deceased in a manner
likely to cause death was under the circumstances so clearly a natural or
ordinary consequence of the acts done by the prisoners that the jury, acting as
reasonable men, could not have found otherwise

[Page 588]

than that they knew or should have known that
the deceased was likely to so use that gun? Upon both these matters of fact it
was the function of the jury to determine what inference should be drawn. Upon
neither were they given the opportunity of doing so. On the contrary they were
directed that if they should “come to the conclusion that what these men did
resulted from hatred or dislike or ill will that would make it murder.”

It is not possible to read the charge of the
learned Chief Justice without realizing that the jury were instructed that,
although in the absence of personal grudge or ill will on their part towards
the deceased the acts done by them and the consequences which ensued would have
rendered them guilty only of manslaughter, those same acts and consequences, if
accompanied by spite or ill will towards the deceased, would make them guilty
of murder. The only question really left for the consideration of the jury in
determining whether their verdict should be one of murder or of manslaughter
was whether in doing what they did the defendants were actuated by ill will to
the deceased.

With great respect, this involved ignoring the
requirement of the Code that the acts of the accused must have been such as
they knew or should have known would be likely under the circumstances, to
cause death, or an assumption by the learned judge himself of the function of
the jury in regard to that vital question of fact, or a direction that the acts
of the accused were of such a character that as a matter of law the jury should
assume that they knew or should have known that they would be likely to cause
death.

[Page 589]

Under such a direction the jury may have
convicted of murder without at all considering whether the conduct of the
accused was such that it was probable that it would cause the deceased to act
in a manner likely to result in some person being killed. Indeed, they might
return such a verdict, although no reasonable man could say that such a result
from the acts of the accused should or even might have been reasonably
anticipated. That this was a vital misdirection amounting to a substantial
wrong or miscarriage in the trial seems only too plain.

It is unnecessary to express our views upon any
of the numerous other points raised in the stated case.

It is abundantly clear that this is not a case
in which we should exercise the power conferred by section 1018  of the Criminal
Code  sub-section (d) to direct that the appellants should be discharged.

For the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion,
however, that their conviction must be quashed and a new trial had.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA.

Criminal law—Perjury—Form of oath.

A witness who testifies to what is false is guilty of perjury,
although, without being asked if he had any objection to being sworn in the
usual manner, but without objecting to the form used, he was directed to take
the oath by raising his right hand instead of kissing the Bible.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia[1]
affirming, by an equal division of opinion, the conviction of the appellant for
perjury.

The appellant was charged with having
committed perjury on the investigation of a charge against a customs official
and was tried at Sydney, N.S., and convicted. The following questions were
reserved by the trial judge for the opinion of the Court of Appeal.

“Was I right in holding that there was
sufficient corroborative evidence to warrant a conviction?

“The defendant was sworn by holding up his
right hand without being asked whether he had any objection to being sworn in
the regular way.

“It was objected that the accused was never
sworn, and that he could not be convicted of perjury on evidence so given.

[Page 533]

“Was I right in holding that he could be
convicted on the evidence so given?”

The judges of the Court of Appeal were
unanimous in answering the first question in the affirmative and it is,
therefore, not before the Court on this appeal. On the second question they
were equally divided.

Maddin for the
appellant.

Jenks K.C., Deputy
Attorney-General, for the respondent.

The Chief Justice.—This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sitting as
a court for Crown cases reserved.

The appellant was convicted of perjury by the
judge of the County Court District No. 7.

These two questions were reserved for the
opinion of the Supreme Court en banc:—

1. In the circumstances in the reserved
case was the trial judge right in holding that there was sufficient
corroborative evidence to warrant a conviction?

2. The defendant having been sworn by
holding up his right hand without being asked whether he bad any objection to
being sworn in the regular way, was the judge right in holding that he could be
convicted on evidence so given?

The Supreme Court held unanimously that there
was sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction, and this appeal is, therefore,
limited to the second question as to which the judges of that court were
equally divided.

It is admitted that the accused appeared as a
witness in a proceeding before a competent tribunal and being questioned with
respect to a matter material in that proceeding made as part of his evidence an
assertion of fact which, for the purpose of this appeal, it

[Page 534]

must be assumed he then knew to be false. The
defence is that at the request of the commissioner the accused took his oath in
the more ancient of the two forms known in modern proceedings, “the adjuratory
invocation of the Deity with uplifted hand commonly called the Scotch oath,” no
attempt having been previously made to ascertain whether he had any objection
to taking the oath in the comparatively modern form by kissing the book. And it
is argued that in consequence the false assertion which is the foundation of
the charge of perjury was not made upon oath. This defence is apparently based
on the assumption that the acknowledged form of oath is that which is
administered by kissing the book, and that the oath in the Scotch form can only
be taken in exceptional cases, as it were, upon cause shewn.

With all deference I cannot see the force of
this objection. Both forms are recognized and used in the provincial courts at
the option of the witness. In this case, the investigating commissioner asked
the accused to raise his hand, which he did without protest, and then repeated
to him these words:—

The evidence you will give in this inquiry
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God,

after which he proceeded to give his evidence.
If he did not, in these circumstances take an oath, that is, call God to
witness the truth of what he was about to testify to, I am at a loss to
understand what these words mean. Having taken the oath in that form without
objection, it is an admission that the witness regarded it as binding on his
conscience, and that is the object for which the oath was used both in ancient
and modern times[2].
To hold otherwise would be to

[Page 535]

put a premium upon perjury, and as those who
take part in the administration of justice are painfully aware, a great amount
of false wearing is allowed to go unpunished.

It is now admitted to be the absolute right of
every person in the English courts to be sworn for every purpose in Scotch form
without the use of any book and without any question being asked. It may be
open to question whether it is not better as a matter of public policy for our
courts and other persons administering oaths to adhere to the time-honoured
custom of swearing witnesses upon the Bible or Testament in all cases except
those where the witness or party claims to have conscientious objections to
swearing in that mode or form.

But we think, however that may be, that where no
such objection is raised and the oath is taken voluntarily by a person with
uplifted hand and calling God to witness the truth of his evidence or
statements, it would be alike a mocking of justice and a disregard of the
common law as we understand it to allow such a person on an indictment for
perjury to escape on the sole ground that he took the oath without being sworn
on the Bible or New Testament.

The appeal should be dismissed. No costs.

Davies, Duff and     JJ. concurred.

Idington J.—The appellant having been convicted of perjury, two questions
were reserved for the Court of Appeal. Of these one having been disposed of
unanimously by that court against the contention of appellant, he can only
appeal here in respect of the other regarding which that court was divided.

[Page 536]

That question brought thus before us is stated
as follows:—

The defendant was sworn by holding up his
right hand without being asked whether he had any objection to being sworn in
the regular way.

It was objected that the accused was never
sworn, and that he could not be convicted of perjury on evidence so given.

Was I right in holding that he could be
convicted on the evidence so given?

The proceeding out of which the charge arises
was an inquiry by a commissioner under and pursuant to chapter 104 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, wherein it admittedly was within the power
and duty of the commissioner by virtue of section 4 of the said Act “to require
witnesses to give evidence on oath or on solemn affirmation if they are persons
entitled to affirm in civil matters.”

The commissioner testified at the trial of the
appellant, amongst other things, as follows:—

Q. Was the evidence given under oath? A. I
think under oath, although some little question with regard to that has been
raised. There was no copy of the Bible used. In a few oases where the copy of
the Scripture was not readily available I called the witness to hold up his
right hand and went through the formula with the man. It was done in this case.

Q. Tell what was done? A. I called the
witness to raise his right hand and I put this formula to him: “The evidence
you will give in this inquiry will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help your God?”

Q. And did he raise his right hand? A. He
raised his right hand.

By the court.

Q. I suppose, Mr. Duchemin, you determined
yourself the manner in which you would swear him? A. Yes, I did not ask any
questions.

The contention is that appellant so sworn and
giving the evidence in respect whereof he has been convicted of perjury, never
in law was sworn because the oath was not accompanied by his kissing the Bible
or being examined by the commissioner as

[Page 537]

to his religious belief entitling him to be
sworn in the form adopted.

The crime of perjury of which he has been
convicted and the circumstances under which a person may be convicted thereof,
are defined by section 170 and subsequent sections of the Criminal Code:—

Section 170. Perjury is an assertion * * *
made by a witness * * * as part of his evidence upon oath or affirmation * * *
such assertion being known to such witness to be false and being intended by
him to mislead * * * the person holding the proceedings.

And inasmuch as the appellant in this case
signed the evidence when read over to him, I think section 172 may also cover
this case. It is as follows:—

172. Every one is guilty of perjury who—

(a) having taken or made any oath,
affirmation, solemn declaration or affidavit where, by any Act or law in force
in Canada, or in any province of Canada, it is required or permitted that
facts, matters or things be verified, or otherwise assured or ascertained by or
upon the oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit of any person, wilfully
and corruptly, upon such oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit, deposes,
swears to or makes any false statement as to any such fact, matter or thing.

When we are asked as herein to discard the
fundamental principle of giving effect to statutes and to fritter away the
plain ordinary meaning of the language used in this one, it is somewhat
difficult to treat such a contention seriously.

The form now in question herein of “taking or
making the oath” is in law and in fact much older than the usual one of kissing
the Bible, much older even than the common law, yet recognized by the common
law.

This statute was so framed, I think in 1868, as
to end, if possible, every frivolous attempt of the perjurer to escape, by way
of technicalities and needless subtleties, from the consequences of his
misconduct.

[Page 538]

It was amended by the Criminal Code so as to
render it yet more comprehensive and plain.

It seems to me to subserve the purposes for
which it was enacted and to fit well the case now presented to us.

The appellant took or made an oath and by virtue
thereof was permitted to testify and if he wilfully and corruptly testified to
that which was false, the plain purpose of the enactment is that he should
suffer the punishment it awards.

It is entirely beside the question to cite cases
where in the course of administering justice, men have been found to have taken
oaths whereby their impiety or ill instructed consciences might permit them to
make a secret mockery of justice, and might lead to their injuring others by
speaking falsely; and hence out of regard to the rights of those so injured,
the evidence so given has been set aside or treated as null.

We are not dealing here with such a question,
but with the law which makes such men in any event liable to the punishments the
law has provided for the misconduct involved not only in so trifling with the
court and the rights of others, but also in so doing, speaking wilfully and
corruptly that which was false. In the other case what had been said might have
been absolutely true, but had to be treated as non-effective for want of the
form of the sanctions the law looked upon as security for truth.

It is, I respectfully submit, a mere confusion
of thought thus to mix these entirely different things and their consequences.

Another confusion of thought is that involved in
the argument that is sought to be derived from the modifications of the law
which debarred many from

[Page 539]

testifying in the only form which their
consciences permitted them to adopt.

The old law debarred such persons often from
testifying at all.

The law also debarred suitors from putting
forward and using such witnesses or others not bound by any oath.

But the law in the most barbarous state in which
it ever was, never excused him, who despite his incapacity to comply with the
law, had taken a form of oath that the court had administered to him, from the
consequences of his having wilfully and corruptly violated the pledges he had
in any accepted form given the court.

The argument founded upon the 16th section of
the Criminal Code has, if possible, still less to commend it.

There never was in the common law anything to
justify or excuse any man for violating so plain a statute as this now in
question.

It is extremely desirable that men appearing as
witnesses in our courts and in such capacity taking any form of oath or making
any affirmation, should understand they are, when wilfully and corruptly
speaking falsely under any such circumstances, liable to be convicted of
perjury, whatever may be their peculiar religious, mental or moral conceptions
of the binding effect of the form of oath or affirmation.

The appeal must be dismissed.

Anglin J.—The question for determination in this case is whether the
defendant took an oath which renders him liable to the penalties of perjury for
false testimony given under it. The commissioner before

[Page 540]

whom the oath was taken was authorized to
administer it. Because a copy of the Holy Scriptures was not at hand he
administered the oath in what is usually known as the Scotch form—that is, the
deponent with uplifted hand called upon Almighty God to witness that he would
speak the truth. He was not asked whether he had any conscientious objection to
taking the oath in the manner customary at the present day in English courts, nor
did he explicitly state that the oath in the form in which he took it was
recognized by him as binding upon his conscience.

Prom the short review of forms of oaths in the
Encyclopædia of the Laws of England, vol. 10, page 103, it would appear that at
common law the touching or kissing of the Bible or Testament is not essential
to the taking of an oath. In the leading case of Attorney-General v. Bradlaugh[3], where various questions
respecting oaths, their binding effect and their forms were carefully considered,
Lord Justice Cotton, quoting a passage from the judgment of Martin B., in Miller
v. Salomons[4],
at page 515, says that that learned judge, after referring to Omychund v.
Barker[5]
as correctly stating the law, proceeds thus:—

The doctrine laid down by the Lord
Chancellor and all the other judges was that the essence of an oath was an
appeal to a Supreme Being in whose existence the person taking the oath
believed, and whom he also believed to be a rewarder of truth and an avenger of
falsehood, and that the form of taking an oath was a mere outward act not
essential to the oath.

The Lord Justice adds:—

I read that because it shews how, down to
the latest times, what was laid-down in Omychund v. Barker5
has been recognized, as we recognize it, as correctly stating what the Law
of England is as regards taking an oath.

[Page 541]

In the same case (at p. 701) Brett M.R. says:—

If a person who could take an oath, * * *
nevertheless took it in a manner which disregarded the due solemnities of the
mode of taking an oath which are appointed in this Act of Parliament, or, if he
took the oath, and did not, within the meaning of this Act of Parliament,
subscribe the oath; * * * on reflection, I am of opinion that he would be
liable to the penalty.

The defendant in the present case did that which
constitutes “the essence of an oath”—he called upon Almighty God, in whose
existence and divine attributes it is not suggested that he did not believe, to
witness the truth of that which he was about to say.

For the defendant it is urged that with him
rested the option of determining what form of oath he should take—that, unless
he elected not to take the oath in the form customary in the English courts and
claimed the right to take it in the Scotch form, an oath in that form should
not have been administered to him and would not render him liable to the
penalty of perjury. If the assent of the witness to the administration of the
oath in any form other than that which is customary in the English courts be
requisite, I am of the opinion that by taking the oath in the form in which it
was tendered to him, making no protest against it but proceeding to give his
evidence with the knowledge that it would be accepted and acted upon as
testimony given under oath, he sufficiently assented to the oath being
administered in the form in which it was, and that he cannot, upon being
afterwards charged with perjury, be heard to say that he was not sworn.

For these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA.

Findings of fact—Inferences by
jury—Determining cause of accident —Evidence to support verdict—Practice.

Where the jury, drawing inferences, adopted
one of several theories respecting the determining Cause of the accident
through which the plaintiff’s injuries were sustained, and there was evidence
to support their finding, the court refused to disturb the verdict.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming the judgment of Prendergast
J., at the trial, which, on the
verdict of the jury, ordered that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff.

The circumstances of the case are stated in
the judgments now reported.

W. N. Tilley for
the appellants.

Cohen for the
respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—This is an appeal from the judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Manitoba in an action for damages for personal injuries
sustained by the plaintiff while travelling as a passenger in a tramcar

[Page 81]

car of the defendants. The plaintiff’s claim is
based upon the allegation that her injuries were the consequences of a fall
caused by the negligence of the motorman or conductor of the car which was
started suddenly after having been brought to a stop to enable her to get off.

The plaintiff and one Winkler are the only
witnesses who testify to the occurrence. At the close of the evidence for the
plaintiff, counsel for the defendant company submitted there was no evidence of
negligence. It appears that the plaintiff rang the bell as a signal for the car
to stop at the corner of Bushnell street. Having failed, presumably, to attract the attention of the
conductor or motorman, the car proceeded at high speed in the direction of Gunnell street when the plaintiff rang the
bell a second time to manifest her desire to alight at that street. As the car
was slowing down, plaintiff left her seat and moved in the direction of the
door. When she reached that place the car was stopped; she says,

my right foot I put on the first step and
after that I do not remember anything.

The witness Winkler deposed that he heard a
woman’s scream and ran to the scene of the accident, where he found the
plaintiff lying on the road covered with blood and apparently dead. The car in
which the plaintiff had been a passenger was seen to be in motion proceeding on
its journey a very short distance ahead.

The question is: In these facts was there
evidence enough of an apparent cause to leave the case for the decision of the
jury?

The point is not free from difficulty, but I am
of

[Page 82]

opinion that, in the circumstances, the trial
judge was justified in leaving it to the jury to say whether the company being
under a duty to stop the car in answer to her signal for a sufficient time to
allow the plaintiff to alight, the inference of negligence should be drawn.

It is to be assumed that if proper care is used
by the company a passenger may alight in safety from a tram-car, and, in the
circumstances of this case, there is a rule of evidence which calls upon the
carrier in the first instance to exonerate itself by negativing negligence.

If there was doubt on the evidence of
the plaintiff and Winkler, the conduct of the officials of the company at the
time of the accident may have served to turn the scale. The plaintiff was
undoubtedly a passenger on the car and in attempting to alight the accident
occurred, and there is further evidence in the record. The rules of the company
required that in cases of accidents the motorman and conductor should render assistance and make a report of the occurrence. They did neither, and the
reasonable presumption is that their omission in that respect was due to the
fact that the accident must have happened without their knowledge. The jury
would be justified in taking this circumstance into account when considering
the probabilities of plaintiff’s theory that she was thrown from the step by a
violent jerk when the car was started suddenly by the officials in ignorance of
the position in which she then was.

On the whole I am of opinion that this appeal
should be dismissed with costs.

Davies J.—The question we have to determine is whether there was evidence to
justify the findings of

[Page 83]

the jury with respect to the fact that the car had
stopped when the plaintiff attempted to alight from it and had negligently
started again and thrown her to the ground before she had alighted.

On the first point we have the positive evidence
of the plaintiff that the car had stopped, with an apparently clear and
connected statement of the circumstances leading up to the stoppage. The only
possible doubt as to the correctness of her statements arises from the rather
uncertain and doubtful evidence of the only other witness called who speaks of
the fact of the stoppage of the car. The jury surely had the right to accept
the clear and unqualified statement of Mrs. Schwartz on the point.

Then, as to the finding of the negligent
starting of the car having been the cause of her falling or being thrown to the
pavement, Mrs. Schwartz frankly states that the shock she received from her
fall completely destroyed or benumbed her memory of the facts immediately
connected with her falling and that she could recall nothing which happened
from the moment she attempted to step from the car till after her recovery from
the shock caused by her fall to the pavement.

The company, at the close of plaintiff’s case,
moved for a nonsuit and that being refused did not call any witnesses. The
question is whether, in the absence of direct evidence on this point of
negligence, there should have been a nonsuit, or whether it was open to the
jury to draw as a fair and reasonable inference from such facts as had been
proved that the car had stopped and had started negligently, causing the
plaintiff’s fall.

There were decisions given by this court before

[Page 84]

that of the Judicial Committee in the case of McArthur
v. The Dominion Cartridge Company[2], to the
effect that positive evidence of specific negligence causing the injuries complained
of must toe given to enable an injured person to recover damages. Since that
decision, however, this court has followed the rule or principle there laid
down, namely, that where the circumstances are such that positive and direct
evidence on specific negligence cannot be given it is open to a jury, if the
facts as proved are sufficient, to find such negligence as a fair reasonable
inference from those facts. It was upon that rule we decided the case of The
Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Hainer[3], and many cases since then.

Now, in the case before us, what have we had
proved? First, the high speed at which the car was moving and its stoppage
after the second signal from the plaintiff to permit her to alight. Secondly,
the passenger’s progress during the slowing-down of the car towards the door of
exit and, on the stoppage, her attempt to step to the ground, in which attempt
she either fell from, as is suggested by the appellants, a sudden attack of
vertigo, or, as found by the jury, was thrown down by the sudden, negligent
starting of the car. There was no evidence whatever of any negligence on the
passenger’s part or facts proved from which a fair inference of negligence
could be drawn. Thirdly, the fact that the car rapidly moved on its way after
stopping without those controlling it presumably having knowledge of the
accident.

It is inconceivable that with such knowledge the
car should have been allowed to proceed and no aid

[Page 85]

or assistance tendered the injured passenger
left lying on or alongside of the car track. The presumption of ignorance of
the accident on the part of the car-men is overwhelming; especially when
considered in light of the fact that another car was following very close after
them. They probably thought the passenger had safely alighted.

Under those circumstances, and without any other
suggested possible inference than that the violent fall to the pavement might
have been caused by a sudden attack of vertigo, I have no difficulty in
concluding that the finding of the jury has a preponderating weight in its
favour, because it is the more fair and reasonable inference from the proved
facts. The other suggested inferences seem to me rather to be classed as
conjectures than fair inferences.

A jury cannot, of course, select as between equally probable and fair
inferences one which they prefer. It is essential that their finding should not
only be fair and reasonable, but that it should be of preponderating weight
over other possible inferences.

Idington J,—This appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.

Duff J.—I think there is evidence in support of the verdict. It is no part
of my duty to say whether I think it is right or not.

Anglin J.—The sole question raised upon this appeal is whether there was
evidence sufficient to warrant the finding of the jury that the plaintiff fell
from the step of the defendants’ car, as she was in the course of alighting
from it at a proper stopping place

[Page 86]

and, while it was stationary, and their
inference that this was due to the negligence of the defendants’ servants in
improperly starting the car before the plaintiff had reached the ground. From
the plaintiff herself we have direct evidence that the car had stopped (the
jury was entitled to disregard the evidence given by Winkler, if it is really
in conflict with that of the plaintiff on this point), that she was in course
of alighting and had one foot on the first step and the other either on the
platform or in the air on its way to the second step. At that point her
knowledge of what occurred ceased. That she fell violently to the ground is
undisputed. That the company’s servants in charge of the car from which she
fell were ignorant of her fall is an irresistible inference from the fact that
they proceeded on their way leaving her lying seriously injured on the ground,
unless we are to assume on their part a callousness and disregard of the
company’s rules almost incredible. A moment or two later she is found lying
dangerously near the track, so much so that the conductor of a following car
moved her body out of the way. According to her evidence the plaintiff was
proceeding to alight with care. There is no evidence to warrant any suggestion
of vertigo, fainting, tripping or being run down by a passing vehicle as the
cause of her fall and injuries. The inference that her fall was caused, as the
jury have found, is not only fair and reasonable; it seems to be the most
probable inference that could be drawn from all the facts. The negligence
involved in starting a car from which a passenger is properly alighting before
ascertaining that she has reached the ground is indisputable.

[Page 87]

The appeal fails and should be dismissed with
costs.

Brodeur J.—The only question is whether the jury could from the facts
established infer that the street railway company is guilty of negligence.

The plaintiff, respondent, Mrs. Schwartz, was
alighting from a street car of the company defendant. She states in her
evidence that she rang the bell to stop the car; that the car stopped, and that
she started to alight from the car, and she states, moreover, that from that
moment until some days afterwards when she found herself on a hospital bed with
serious injuries as a result of her fall oh the street, she was unconscious.

The jury returned a verdict that the employees
caused the car to start-when the plaintiff was proceeding to alight.

The company did not find it advisable to bring
those employees to testify that they had given to that lady all the time
necessary to safely alight.

That lady fell on account of her fainting or on
account of the starting of the car before she alighted. The accident is
necessarily due to one of those circumstances. The jury could draw the
inferences from all the circumstances of the case that the company was
negligent.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

jury—Misdirection—Reducing charge to manslaughter—New trial—""Substantial
wrong""—Criminal Code , ss. 261 , 1019 —Appeal—Questions to be reviewed,

[Page 1]

On a trial for the murder of a police officer there was
evidence that E. and J. had set
out from their home, during the night when the deceased was killed, with the
intention of committing theft; J. and his wife testified that, on returning
home, E. had told them that a
man, whom he supposed to he a secret-police constable, had pointed a pistol at
him and told him to ""go to hell"" and that he had shot him. The
defence was rested entirely upon alibi and the accused testified on his
own behalf stating that he had been at home during the whole of the night in
question, but making no mention of any facts concerning the shooting. In his
charge the trial judge reviewed the evidence, in a general way, and told the jury
that, upon the evidence adduced, they

[Page 2]

must either convict or acquit of the crime of murder, that
they could not return a verdict of manslaughter, that if they believed J.'s
account of what happened to be substantially true they should convict of
murder.; and he did not instruct the jury as to what, in law, constituted
manslaughter nor as to circumstances on which the verdict might be reduced to
manslaughter. E. was convicted of murder.

Held, Duff J. dissenting, that, on the evidence, the
charge of the trial judge was right, and that the omission to instruct the jury
in respect to manslaughter did not occasion any substantial wrong or
miscarriage which could justify the setting aside of the conviction nor a
direction for a new trial.

Per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J.—In a criminal
appeal, it is doubtful whether any question except that upon which there was a
dissent in the court below could be reviewed on an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada.

Per Duff J., dissenting.—In the circumstances of the
case, the effect of the charge was to withdraw from the jury some evidence
which ought to have been considered by them and which, if considered (by them,
might have influenced them favourably towards the accused in arriving at their
verdict; consequently, some substantial wrong was thereby occasioned on the
trial and the conviction should not be permitted to stand.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court for the Province
of Alberta[1], which
affirmed the conviction of the appellant of the crime of murder, Beck J.
dissenting.

At the trial, in April, 1912, before Mr. Justice Simmons and a
jury, the appellant was convicted of the murder of a Royal North-West Mounted
police constable, at Frank, in Alberta, on the night of the 12th of April,
1908, and was sentenced to death. An application for a reserved case was
refused by the trial judge. Upon application to the court in banco, an
appeal was heard, the notice of appeal raising the following questions:—

""(1) As to whether the said learned judge erred in directing
the jury that there were only two possible conclusions they could come to, a
verdict of guilty

[Page 3]

of murder or a verdict of not guilty and that they could not
consider the question of manslaughter at all.

""(2) As to whether the said learned judge erred in
refusing to instruct the jury that if they found that the crime was committed
by the accused without malice, they were entitled to bring in a verdict of
manslaughter.

""(3) As to whether the said learned judge erred in not
instructing the jury as to what elements constituted the crime of murder and
what that of manslaughter and the difference between said two offences.

""(4) As to whether the said learned judge erred in not
instructing the jury that they might, and under what circumstances they might,
on a charge of murder bring in a verdict of manslaughter.

""(5) As to whether the said learned judge erred in
instructing the jury that the evidence of witnesses as to seeing a flash and
hearing a noise at a certain hour was corroborative of the evidence of the
witness Jasbec.

""(6) As to whether the said learned judge erred in
instructing the jury that the evidence of the wife of the witness Jasbec was
corroborative of the evidence of said Jasbec.

""(7) As to whether the said learned judge erred in not
instructing the jury that if they believed the evidence of the witness Jasbec
they must believe it wholly.""

The Supreme Court for Alberta having dismissed this appeal,
Mr. Justice Beck dissenting, on the ground that there had been misdirection at
the trial which occasioned substantial wrong or miscarriage

[Page 4]

and that there should be a new trial, the appellant appealed
to the Supreme Court of Canada.

The charge to the jury, by Mr. Justice Simmons, was as
follows:—

""Gentlemen of the jury:—It is my duty to explain
to you the law concerning the offence which is charged against the defendant
here, and to explain to you the application of the law governing this offence
in relation to the offence which is before you in so far as it may affect the
guilt or innocence of the defendant Fritz Eberts. It is not necessary for me to
define to you what murder is. You know pretty well what that means. But there
are some specific definitions given which may possibly widen the meaning of the
term murder from its common interpretation, and they are to this effect, that
when a person goes out to commit some indictable offence, such as burglary or
robbery, and if he means to inflict grievous bodily harm for the purpose of
facilitating the commission of any such offence, such as burglary or robbery,
or to facilitate the flight of an offender upon the commission or attempted
commission thereof, and death ensues from such injury, that would be murder. So
that you see a person might be guilty of murder in that sense, although he may
not have a murderous intention in the common ordinary conception of that term.
He may have started out to commit a common indictable offence and may have
armed himself for that purpose, in order to assist in committing the offence or
to assist in his escape.

""Now, in the present case the evidence on one branch of
this is quite clear — that is, as to the death of the unfortunate young man.
That is well localized as to the place and the time. There is the

[Page 5]

evidence of Kroning, the brakeman, as to seeing the flash and
hearing the report of a gun, and the evidence of two other witnesses who heard
the noise sometime during the night — at least after twelve or one o'clock, and
Pietro Amicarello being another; all identifying the time as being after twelve
or one o'clock, and in the vicinity, according to Pietro Amicarello and
Kroning, of between two o'clock and half past two. Kroning says it must have
been about that time. The train was due to leave at 2.25 and it took a little
time to pull up the slack, they just got under way when he heard the report and
saw the flash, and the Italian says it was about twenty minutes after two when
he looked at the time in the station. So that part of it seems to be pretty
well localized as to the actual time, and that seems to be very important, and
I may call your attention to it later on.

""Now, the next circumstances coming to light were the
finding of the body by the Chinaman, and by Mr. Steeves and Mr. Haslett, and
there was the examination of the body by the sergeant and by Dr. McKenzie and
by Mr. Addison. I would like to call your attention particularly to the
evidence of Mr. Addison, the undertaker. He described to you very minutely the
condition of the body in relation to the wounds that had been received, all corroborative
of the evidence of the other witnesses that they were fired at close range,
burning the face and around the neck and shoulders and tearing the vital parts
around the lungs and heart. Then Mr. Addison also gave evidence that there were
bruises — a bruise on the shoulder and one on the fore-arm. Then he took out
most of the shot, and one of the witnesses * * * took out the collar button. It
is important for you to remember the condition

[Page 6]

of that collar button in regard to the suggestion that this
was not ordinary shot. You may, if you wish, look at that collar button again,
and that shot, and you may draw any inference therefrom as to the impact of the
shot against any solid substance, having in view what happened to that collar
button.

""Then the Royal North-West Mounted Police began an
investigation around Frank with regard to guns, and apparently made a very full
investigation of all the houses and the foreigners there, and visited the house
of the accused and found the accused and his wife there and Jasbec and his wife
there, and, in response to their request, the two guns are produced — a single
barrelled gun produced by the defendant, which Sergeant Piper says was broken,
and a Mauser rifle produced by Jasbec — the one which he says he brought up
from Taber. Nothing referring particularly to this case seems to happen for
some time after that, further than the inquest and the inquiries that may have
been made in an attempt to ascertain who the parties were and who were
responsible for it., Those seem to be the chief features of the case as regards
the happenings with which the defendant here was not closely related.

""And, as you will have to determine upon the truthfulness
or untruthfulness of the story told by the Jasbecs, to some extent in the way
of corroboration, it is important to observe to what extent the story he tells
may correspond with the facts as they 'have been related by these witnesses,
especially in regard to the time of the injury or murder, and as to the manner
in which it was inflicted.

""Then we have the evidence of Superintendent Primrose as
to the size of the wads, associating them

[Page 7]

with the 12-bore gun — and remember, in regard to that, it
does not seem that the witness Jasbec had any particular opportunity of knowing
that these particular facts would come to light — namely, that Kroning would
see a flash at that particular time, or that a 12-bore wad would be found, or
that the evidence in regard to the nature of the wound would be given in detail
as it has been given by those who examined the bodies, that is, Mr. Addison,
Mr. Primrose and the doctor.

""Now, then, the story told by Jasbec has to be examined
very closely by you because it implicates himself in the doings of that night,
and the Crown have charged him with this crime, and, therefore, I propose, for
the purpose of this trial, to treat him as an accomplice. The result of that
is, that you will apply a rule of evidence which I have mentioned before and
will expect to have this evidence corroborated in material parts, for the very
prudent safeguard that he may have an object in view, namely, self-interest, in
telling a story that might be very beneficial to himself. The same might very
well be applied to his wife's story. Although she is not a party to the
unlawful acts of that evening she is Jasbec's wife, and the affection between
husband and wife might make, or lead her to make, her evidence as favourable as
possible to her husband, and, with that safeguard I have just mentioned, you
will apply the rule as ordinarily applied, that there should be corroboration
with regard to the death of the man and to the circumstances of the death. You
have already had your attention called by me as to corroboration as to the
time, which fairly well fits in with the time, if Jasbec's story is true. It
was getting on to that time in the

[Page 8]

morning — somewhere around two o'clock. One witness described
fairly well where the moon was when he came home about midnight, and the large
mountain lies, according to the evidence, to the south and west of Frank, which
must necessarily cause the moon to set earlier than it would do on the prairie,
for instance.

""Now, another reason for scrutinizing the evidence of
Jasbec carefully is that he admits he has been a criminal, and that he has
helped to kill cattle, and he admits he was associated with people in Frank who
were committing theft. He has told a story here, and has consistently adhered
to it, which, if true, would put upon the defendant the onus of at least
satisfying you that the story told by Jasbec was not a reliable one. He has
been corroborated by his wife, and you may use that evidence for what it is
worth, using the rule I have given you. His story is corroborated by Sergeant
Piper as to the circumstances under which Piper visited the shacks on the
Monday morning. Both families left Frank some, time after that, and it would
appear that certain things happened, in the meantime which caused them some
uneasiness, and they have been related to you, and you can draw whatever
inference you think proper in that regard.

""I might call your attention to one fact that was
referred to by Detective Egan as to the finding of a spot of blood on the
window close to the place where the dead man was lying, and a pool of blood,
all of which seems to lead to the inference that he must have died almost in
his tracks.

""Now, you have those facts, and I propose now to examine
them more particularly in relation to the story told by the defendant himself.
It has been

[Page 9]

pointed out to you in the address by counsel for the Crown,
and quite properly, that while there is always under our administration of
justice a presumption that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty, that is
modified by another rule of evidence:—that there may come a time when the
inculpatory facts may be so numerous and so strong in their bearing that the
onus shifts on to him, then. That was really the form which this trial took.
You had the evidence of a confessed accomplice in the burglary, and who was
with him at the time of the shooting, if true, and you have a complete history
given of their proceedings that night at the time they left the shack, and the
defendant has recognized that, and he has gone into the witness-box and has
told a story, and I must caution you, as to that, that you will apply the rule
to his evidence, that it must be carefully scrutinized because of the
self-interest he has — he is upon trial for his life — and he has recognized
that he should give an explanation of what took place, and he has done so. He
has said that, on the night in question, he was drunk; he does not remember
when he went to bed. He corroborates Jasbec in the fact that he, Jasbec, and
his wife were at his house that night. He does not say that he slept with
Jasbec in the kitchen, but he says that in the morning he was in his bedroom
with his wife; and his wife says the same thing, but she does not seem to be
very clear as to how many nights she and Mrs. Jasbec slept in the bedroom. She
said they did sleep there sometimes, and that Jasbec, and her husband slept in
the kitchen sometimes. So there seems to be very little clashing in their
evidence, except as to the place of sleeping, up to the time that Jasbec says
they set out. Jasbec and his wife do not deny that

[Page 10]

there was some drinking going on on Saturday, but they do not
give any details about it, and they do not pretend to remember anything about
it. Now, then, the story told by the defendant would require close scrutiny in
regard to his actions in the meantime, in so far as the evidence divulges what
they are. The evidence shews that when he was at Trail Creek, Montana, he
became quite disturbed because his partner came and brought him news that a man
resembling Jasbec had come there, and then he told him of the murder of the
policeman — he told Kane — and also that he was afraid that this man purporting
to be Jasbec might talk too much; that is Kane's version of it. Eberts gives as
a reason for being worried about the big man, purporting to be Jasbec, that he would
have a fight with him. You should examine that very closely. You may draw what
inference you think fit as to whether he would be worried about Jasbec — the
big man coming to Trail Creek — if the story that Eberts has told in the
witness box is the true one; namely, that he was at home and asleep and had no
knowledge of the murder other than what he might have heard afterwards. Then
there is his statement when the policeman Collins and the policeman Gorman went
to arrest him. He denies that in toto, and also the statement of
Sergeant Piper as to what he said to him after Piper cautioned him. So you see
that the defendant has put himself into this position — that he has placed his
word against that of Constable Collins, and he has placed his word against that
of Sergeant Piper, and he has given an explanation as to his uneasiness about
Jasbec coming to Trail Creek, which you may draw an inference from such as you
think proper. You have heard the whole of the evidence,

[Page 11]

and if you come to the conclusion he did go out, as Jasbec
says, that night and that that 12-bore double-barrelled shot gun of Jasbec's
was taken with them, and that that was the instrument which caused the death of
the policeman, Willmett, then you will consider that in relation to the
explanation I have given you as to the law which applies to people who go out
to commit an indictable offence and take firearms with them, and kill a man
either in effecting the purpose of committing that offence, or in trying to
escape.

""I am bound to say to you, and instruct you, that there
seem to be only two conclusions you can come to, that is, a verdict of guilty
of murder or a verdict of not guilty. I cannot see where you could consider the
question of manslaughter at all, in view of the statement of Eberts himself.
There is this to say also, that Jasbec after his arrest, at least very soon
after, made up his mind to tell his story, which is practically the one which
he has told to you. In regard to Eberts's wife, there does not seem to be very
much in her evidence that contradicts the story of Jasbec and the story of
Jasbec's wife, other than the question of where they slept and the question as
to whether Eberts spoke to Mrs. Jasbec on the Sunday or not. In other respects,
what she has said would largely coincide with the happenings that occurred
around the house of Eberts, and around the shack of Jasbec on the Saturday and
Sunday in question. It will be your duty, then, having regard to the
explanation I have given of the law and the way in which you will proceed to
treat the evidence, to come to a conclusion as to whether Jasbec's story of the
happenings of that night, from the time they left the shack until the time they
got back is substantially the true story, because,

[Page 12]

if it is, there is then no explanation from the defendant that
would enable me to give you any other instructions than what I have given you;
namely, to find a verdict of guilty against him, that is, if Jasbec's story —
that they started out and went to the Canadian Pacific Railway freight sheds
first, and then went around by P. Burns's store, and then around behind the
Imperial Hotel, and that they had a gun with them, and that the accused asked
for the gun and got it at the time they saw the shadow, or what they thought was
the shadow, of a man and Jasbec heard the shot, and the other evidence given by
these other people, that they heard a shot then — leaves it in the position
that, if Jasbec's story is substantially true in regard to these important
features of the happenings that night, then there is no alternative for you but
to bring in a verdict of guilty.

""If there is a reasonable doubt in your mind — and the
meaning to be attributed to that term 'reasonable doubt' was very well
explained by counsel for the Crown, and the reference he gave of a very learned
judge — I do not think I can improve on that — if you have a reasonable doubt
you are entitled to give Fritz Eberts the benefit of that doubt.

""If there is anything you wish instructions on during
your consideration of the matter you are to let me know and you will obtain it.
You will also have access to the exhibits, if you wish them, during your
consideration. You will now retire to consider your verdict.""

MR. MACLEOD:—""Before the jury retires I wish you to
instruct them on two or three matters. I wish your Lordship to instruct the
jury that if they believe the

[Page 13]

story of Jasbec or any part of it they
must believe it wholly.""

THE COURT:—""No.""

MR. MACLEOD:—""I wish to read to your Lordship from
Wills on Evidence[2]
(reading): 'It is essential to justice that a confessional statement, if it be
consistent, probable and uncontradicted should be taken together, and not
distorted, or but partially adopted.' 'It is a rule of law,' said Lord
Ellenborough, that when evidence is given of what a party has said or sworn,
all of it is evidence (subject to the consideration of the jury, however, as to
its truth), coming, as it does, in one entire form before them; but you may
still judge as to what parts of the whole you can give credit; and also whether
that part which appears to confirm and fix the charge does not outweight that
which contains the exculpation. On the trial of a man for murder committed 24
years before, the principal inculpatory evidence consisted of his confession,
which stated in substance that he was present at the murder, but went to the
spot without any previous knowledge that a murder was intended and took no part
in it. It was urged that the prisoner's concurrence must be presumed from his
presence at the murder, but Mr. Justice Littledale held that the statement must
be taken as a whole; and that so qualified it did not in fairness amount to an
admission of the guilt of murder; and where the prisoner's declaration in which
she asserted her innocence, was given in evidence, and there was evidence of
other statements confessing guilt, the judge left the whole of the conflicting
statements to the jury for their consideration.'""

[Page 14]

""The point is this, if they believe the statement of Jasbec
they must accept his whole statement.""

THE COURT:—""With the qualifications, which I have
warned them about which applies always to an accomplice, and that is the reason
of the rule of evidence requiring corroboration of the evidence of an
accomplice, because of the probability of the accomplice making the story
favourable to himself.""

MR. MACLEOD:—""Your Lordship has the whole statement
of Jasbec before you, and I would ask you to address the jury that if they
believe the whole statement of Jasbec then they must bring in a verdict of
manslaughter.""

THE COURT:—""If you wish to argue that after the jury
retire you may do so. I have instructed the jury as to the rule of evidence
applying as to an accomplice.""

MR. NOLAN:—""And in the meantime I wish the jury to
retire.""

MR. MACLEOD:—""Your Lordship will not instruct the
jury on that point?""

THE COURT:—""No.""

MR. MACLEOD:—""I will ask you to instruct them, with'
regard to April 11th, 1908, that the jury must conclusively find that there
were four persons in the Eberts house on that afternoon.""

THE COURT:—""I have referred to that in my address to
them.""

MR. MACLEOD:—""Notwithstanding the evidence of Jasbec
and the wife they must conclusively find under the evidence that there were
four persons there in the afternoon.""

THE COURT:—""And what bearing has that upon the case
?""

[Page 15]

MR. MACLEOD:—""It affects the credibility of the
evidence.""

THE COURT:—""That is a question within the competence
of the jury.""

MR. MACLEOD:—""There is a rule of law.""

THE COURT:—""It is a question of fact.""

MR. MACLEOD:—""But where two persons swear to a
negative and two persons swear to a positive the positive must prevail.""

MR. NOLAN:—""But I would ask that the jury retire
now.""

THE COURT:—""Any other application ?""

MR. MACLEOD:—""I would like you to direct the jury
that the rule may also be considered that, to justify conviction in a criminal
case, the evidence of guilt must not only be a balance of probability, but it
must also satisfy the jury that the accused is guilty. They cannot balance
probabilities. I would ask you to instruct the jury that the evidence must be
such as to exclude the hypothesis of innocence; the evidence to convict must be
such as to exclude the presumption of innocence or hypothesis of
innocence.""

THE COURT:—""The rule was well known, and has been
explained by me to the jury, that if they believe beyond a reasonable doubt, as
reasonable men, using the common sense and intellect that reasonable men use in
the affairs of life, especially in relation to serious matters — using that
common sense — if they as reasonable men believe that the story told by Jasbec
is the true one, there is no alternative for them but to bring in the verdict I
have indicated — the verdict of guilty; if they have a reasonable doubt as to
the truth of that story, so far as it implicates Eberts, they will give Eberts
the benefit of that reasonable doubt.""

[Page 16]

J. W. McDonald and Colin MacLeod, for the
appellant. It should have been left to the jury to decide as between
manslaughter and murder; these should have been distinguished. Reg. v. Brennari[3];
Rex v. Wong On[4]; Rex
v: Scherf[5];
Rex v. Daley[6]. In Gilbert
v. The King[7], there
was no evidence whatever to support a verdict of manslaughter; the evidence was
that the shooting was an accident. In the present case there is evidence upon
which the jury might reasonably have found manslaughter; the circumstances
which might have justified a verdict of manslaughter and which are detailed in
the' judgment of Mr. Justice Beck[8]. The
trial judge, in his charge, passes over these points, and dismisses the
question of manslaughter. It was the right and privilege of the jury to be
instructed and directed by the learned trial judge, and it was their duty to
follow the explicit instructions which he gave. These instructions made it impossible
for them to find a verdict of manslaughter.

The learned judge directs the jury that the possibility of a
verdict of manslaughter is wholly excluded by the statement of Eberts himself
that he was not present at the killing of Willmett, but in fact that he was at
his home on the night in question. He does not say that there is not evidence
upon which they could reasonably find Eberts guilty of the reduced crime if
they should find him guilty 'at all, but merely that his own story excluded
such finding. The effect of the direction is that though there may be, in the
evidence given toy other persons, reason to believe the ex

[Page 17]

Istence of circumstances justifying a
verdict of manslaughter, yet as Eberts said he was at his home that night,
these circumstances could not exist. In other words, in this respect he said
that the evidence of Eberts must prevail against all other evidence, and for
the purpose of excluding the possibility of manslaughter they must give full
credence to the story of Eberts in his attempt to prove an alibi. The
learned Chief Justice, who delivered the judgment of the court en banc, apparently
does not agree with this view. Whether Eberts swore falsely or not is
immaterial on the point of manslaughter. If he were guilty of perjury, he was
not, therefore, necessarily, guilty of murder. Rex v. Carr[9].
By modern authority all questions as to motive, intent, heat of blood, etc.,
must be left to the jury and should not be dealt with as propositions of law. The
Queen v. McDowell[10], at page
115. All such questions were excluded entirely from the consideration of the
jury. Reg. v. Brennan[11], at
page 674; Reg. v. Kirkham[12]; Reg.
v. Sherwood[13]; Reg.
v. Smith[14].

The learned trial judge directed the jury: ""When a person
goes out to commit some indictable offence such as burglary or robbery and if
he mean to inflict grievous bodily harm for the purpose of facilitating the
commission of any such offence such as burglary or robbery or to facilitate the
flight of an offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof, and
death ensues from such injury, that would be murder."" This is doubtless a
correct statement of law as laid down in section 260  of the Criminal Code ,

[Page 18]

but it could not but have misled the
jury. The learned judge evidently meant the jury to believe that the accused
had been attempting to commit burglary, whereas the only evidence is that the
accused and Jasbec attempted to gain an entrance to the Canadian Pacific
Railway freight shed and the meatshop of P. Burns. This is shop breaking and
not burglary, and the accused cannot be brought under section 260 , though the
judge so directed the jury, and that that section applied. Even if the section
did apply, the judge should have asked the jury to find whether or not the shot
was fired with a view to facilitate flight.

There were other circumstances which might have reduced the crime
to manslaughter that were not referred to by the judge and which the jury were
not asked to pass upon. If the accused had abandoned his criminal intent and
was on the way home, and Willmett, who was not in uniform, attempted to arrest
him, the arrest was unlawful and accused would not be guilty of murder. Rex v.
Addis[15]; Reg.
v. Carey[16]; Reg,
v. Chapman[17].

The judge was in error in instructing the jury as to
corroboration: in instructing them that Jasbec was corroborated by his wife: Rex
v. Neal[18]; and
in instructing them that the evidence of Kroning and Amicarello was
corroborative: Taylor on Evidence (10 ed.), secs. 969-970. It is immaterial
that there may have been other evidence of corroboration. It is impossible to
say what effect such a direction may have had in bringing the jury to their
conclusion: Rex v. Everest[19].; Allen
v. The King[20].

[Page 19]

We also refer to Rex v. Blythe[21];
Rex v. Ellson[22]; Rex
v. Stoddart[23].

E. F. B. Johnston K.C. and W. M. Campbell for the
respondent, argued that the objections now urged had not been taken in the
courts below; that the only questions open on an appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada were such as related to the dissent in the provincial court of appeal,
and that, on a defence rested entirely on alibi at the trial, the
appellant could not assume the position that there ought to have been a
conviction for manslaughter only.

The following authorities were cited on behalf of the respondent:
Criminal Code , secs. 53, 261, 1019; Rex v. Philpot[24];
Rex v. Barrett[25]; Reg.
v. Fitzgibbon[26]; Gilbert
v. The King[27]; Rex
v. Scholey[28].

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—I concur in the opinion stated by Mr.
Justice Idington.

DAVIES J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Alberta, sitting en banc, refusing, Mr. Justice Beck
dissenting, to grant a new trial to the prisoner who had been tried and
convicted of murder.

The application for a new trial was based upon the contention
that the trial judge -should have instructed the jury that if they believed
Jasbec's account of the

[Page 20]

shooting as detailed to him by the
prisoner immediately after it took place, it was open to them to find the
prisoner guilty of manslaughter only, and that the trial judge had charged the
jury they were bound either to acquit the prisoner altogether or find him
guilty of murder.

Section 261 of the Code reads as follows:—

Culpable homicide, which would otherwise be murder, may be
reduced to manslaughter if the person who causes death does so in the heat of
passion caused by sudden provocation.

The question argued before us and which we are asked by the
prisoner's counsel to decide in the affirmative, is whether or not, under the
evidence given by Jasbec of the conversation he had with the prisoner
immediately after the latter shot the deceased, it was open to the jury to
reduce the crime with which the prisoner was charged from murder to
manslaughter.

No such contention was made with respect to the conversation
given in evidence by Jasbec's wife. From her version one of two conclusions
would have to be drawn, either that in shooting the deceased as and when he did
the prisoner was guilty of murder, or that he shot deceased in
self-defence and should be acquitted. It would not be possible for counsel
successfully to contend, under Mrs. Jasbec's version of the prisoner's
statement of the shooting, that a verdict of manslaughter could be rendered.

But counsel did contend that, on Jasbec's version of prisoner's statement,
the jury might have found him guilty of manslaughter only. I do not think so. I
do not think, in the first place, that it was open to the jury, on the
evidence, to find that the prisoner had abandoned the criminal intent to steal
with which he started out that night. It might be possible for some

[Page 21]

such finding to be made with regard to
Jasbec himself. Both during the unsuccessful attempt to break into Burns's
store, and afterwards while they were standing in the street in the rear of the
bank, Jasbec suggested to the prisoner the abandonment of the criminal
enterprise which they had jointly entered upon and a return home. He further
said that when the prisoner took the gun from him and went away with it, with
the object of meeting the man whose shadow they had seen, he, Jasbec, had made
up his mind to return home. But there was no evidence justifying any such
finding as regards the prisoner.

Then as to the fact of the deceased who was shot being a
secret-police officer, and believed by the prisoner to have been such when he
shot him, I cannot see where there can be any doubt. The prisoner said to
Jasbec just after the shooting, and while they were returning to their shack,
that he guessed the man he shot was one of the secret-police, but was not sure
of it. Probably not; absolute, certain knowledge he (hardly could have had; but
he believed the man was a secret-police officer.

The only ""provocation"" suggested was that stated by the
prisoner to Jasbec that the man who, he guessed, was one of the secret-police,
having found him at the time of night and in the place he did, pointed a pistol
towards him told him to ""go to hell."" Nothing at all is said about
the prisoner being aroused to a ""heat of passion"" by the action of the
police officer. Not a word from which any such state of mind could be inferred.
On the contrary, the prisoner told Jasbec that he raised the gun he carried and
shot the man dead. Looking at all the circumstances and facts surrounding the
unfortunate shooting of the

[Page 22]

officer, as detailed in the evidence, I am not able to bring myself to the
conclusion that any jury of reasonable men could fairly find that the prisoner
shot the deceased while ""in the heat of passion caused by sudden
provocation.""

I think, reading
the charge of the trial judge as a whole and in the light of all the facts
given in evidence, it cannot be said that his direction to the jury that they
must either acquit the prisoner or find him guilty of murder, occasioned such a
substantial wrong or miscarriage on the trial as would give us jurisdiction to
set aside the conviction or direct a new trial.

I think the
judgment of the court below was right and that the appeal should be dismissed.

IDINGTON J.—The appellant and one Jasbec being engaged
about one or two o'clock a.m., in a joint expedition for purposes of stealing
in Frank, in Alberta, at a time when the miners there were on strike, carried
with them a gun, and having tried several places unsuccessfully, saw a man, or
shadow of one, at some distance. The appellant got the gun from Jasbec and
started with it to find out who the man was, suggesting it was possibly an
acquaintance come to scare them. He went one route or direction and Jasbec
another, as agreed between them. Jasbec tells this story and proceeds to say he
concluded to go home and had gone some short distance when he heard a shot
fired, and in a few minutes heard running behind him the appellant with the
gun. Then both ran till near appellant's shack.

The following evidence of Jasbec contains the story as there and
then recited by appellant:—

Q. Did you have any talk with him ?

[Page 23]

A. And then I asked him: ""What is the matter ?""
And he said: ""When I came around that corner first I saw nothing; all at
once a fellow standing in front of me and he pointed a revolver at me and said,
'What are you doing here, go to hell,' and I thought he drawed his gun and
fired at him.""

Q. Who did ?

A. Eberts took his gun up and fired at the fellow who
pointed the revolver at him.

Q. Did you say anything more to him about it ? What was next
said by either of you after that ? What was next said ? Did you ask him
anything then ? He said he drew his gun and fired at him ? He said he drew his
gun up and fired at the man ?

A. And I said: ""What became of him ?"" and he said
he shot him — he shot the fellow and he must be dead because he sank down as
soon as the shot was fired, without a sound.

Q. Did he say anything else about that man to you at that
time ?

A. Yes.

Q. What did he say ?

A. He said: ""I guess it is one of the secret-police,
but I am not sure about it."" That is what he said.

The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf and denied this
whole story of Jasbec and declared he had never been out of his house on the
night in question.

The story of Jasbec so fitted into the surrounding facts and
circumstances as to corroborate it and was so supported by evidence of others
that there could be no doubt of appellant having shot one of the secret-police
found dead next morning with a pistol near his dead hand.

The contention set up is that it might have been the result of a
quarrel or such other facts and circumstances as would in law have reduced the
culpable homicide from murder to manslaughter.

The learned trial judge refused to countenance this claim when
counsel for the accused asked him to direct the jury that under such facts as
in evidence the offence must, if committed, be taken to be manslaughter.
He directed the jury that there did not

[Page 24]

seem to be any ground for a verdict of
manslaughter and it seemed as if there must be a verdict of guilty of murder,
or not guilty.

The court of appeal dismissed an application made to it on this
and other grounds. Mr. Justice Beck dissented, holding that the jury ought to
have been directed as to what would constitute manslaughter, and to consider
whether or not, if the accused were guilty of anything, a verdict of
manslaughter might not be the proper verdict.

It seems to me the learned trial judge and the majority of the
court were right in the view taken by them.

To reduce culpable homicide to manslaughter requires, in the
class of manslaughter cases suggested herein, evidence of roused passions.

The man, whose passions we are asked to find might have been so
aroused, has by his own oath denied the fact and left in his unsworn story
nothing to rest such a finding upon. Moreover, his remarkable career as told by
himself seemed to demonstrate that he was hardly the sort of man to be roused
to passion by the sight of a revolver or the sound of rough language. Indeed, the
language he used in relating this incident now in question to Mrs. Jasbec
slightly varies from above and indicates he felt bound to shoot or was proud of
having shot first.

There is nothing but mere surmise or conjecture on which to rest
such a finding as is claimed to have been legally possible.

The discarding or overlooking such a defence to a charge of
killing a man he knew or believed to be a policeman, properly armed to deal
with midnight prowlers carrying guns, is hardly a case where we

[Page 25]

can, in the language of section 1019 , of
the Criminal Code , find that ""substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice"" entitling us to interfere.

A verdict of that kind in such a case would have been a travesty
of justice and made of the administration of the law a farce.

No jury could properly return such a verdict. It would,
therefore, have been idle or worse for the learned trial judge to have entered
upon an exposition of the law bearing on manslaughter and thus needlessly
perplexed the jury.

It might have been argued in such a case, but it was not in this,
that a man faced with a revolver was put in fear of his life, and, therefore,
shooting first, was entitled to an acquittal. But where a case of manslaughter,
which is supposed to fall within what section 261  of the Criminal Code  defines,
can find place under the very peculiar circumstances of this case, I am at a
loss to understand.

If the learned trial judge had been asked to direct an acquittal
on the ground that the man, having reasonable apprehension of death or grievous
bodily harm, had taken the life of another, he should have explained the law
bearing on the subject and left that to the jury.

True, the circumstances would not have seemed a very promising
foundation to dwell upon such an issue, but it was the only possible issue that
could have been raised on such facts as put in evidence.

The appeal should be dismissed.

As a matter of courtesy due to a man on an appeal for his life we
heard argument about want of corroboration, which, I submit, needs no further
observation than this: The gun found with the pri-

[Page 26]

soner, the wad fitted for it found in and
with the body of the deceased and a mass of evidence that connected appellant
therewith (quite independent of Jasbec and his story), if well marshalled and
fitted together and carefully considered might have spared us that argument.

But I may add that it is doubtful if anything except the only
point upon which a judicial dissent in the court below appeared in judgment can
be brought here.

DUFF J. (dissenting).—I think there should be a new
trial. It appears to me that the effect of the learned trial judge's charge was
to withdraw from the jury evidence which ought to have been considered by them
and which if considered by them might not improperly have given rise to real
doubts as to whether the prisoner was guilty of the offence of which he was
convicted in arriving at their verdict.

The main facts are stated in the judgments in the court below and
I shall refer to them only in so far as is necessary to a clear statement of
the ground upon which I think the verdict should not be permitted to stand. The
prisoner was convicted of murder. The homicide occurred at Frank, Alberta, on
the 12th April, 1908. The trial took place four years afterwards, in April,
1912. The chief witnesses as against the accused were one Jasbec and Jasbec's
wife. Jasbec says that, on the night in question, he and Eberts set out from a
shack on the outskirts of Frank intending to get food by stealing; and that,
abandoning a projected attempt on the Canadian Pacific Railway freight sheds
and a partly executed plan of entering Burns's butcher shop, they gave up the
expe-

[Page 27]

dition and started for home. On the way
home noticing the outlines of a man near the Imperial Hotel who seemed to
disappear ""behind the buildings"" Eberts (so Jasbec's story runs)
said, ""that I bet you is Jan"" (meaning a common companion Jabusick
with whom they had been abroad before on similar expeditions), ""give me
the gun and I will go and see who it is;"" and they separated, Eberts
taking Jasbec's shot-gun and setting out towards the figure they had observed,
while Jasbec proceeded on his way homewards. Shortly afterwards Jasbec says he
heard a shot fired, the sound appearing to come from the direction in which
Eberts had gone. Later Eberts joined him and they reached their shack together.
The next day the unfortunate deceased, a constable of the Royal Northwest
Mounted Police, was found in the vicinity indicated by this evidence obviously
killed by a discharge from a shot-gun. These facts and the evidence given by
Jasbec and Jasbec's wife of statements made by Eberts constitute the substance
of the case made by the Crown against the accused. The accused gave evidence in
his own behalf and his defence was an alibi. The learned trial judge in
effect instructed the jury that if they believed Jasbec's story (in certain
features of it which he specified), then they had no alternative but to convict
him of murder.

The following passages give the substance of the charge so far as
material:—

But there are some specific
definitions given which may possibly widen the meaning of the term murder from
its common interpretation, and they are to this effect, that when a person
goes out to commit some indictable offences, such as burglary or robbery, and
if he means to inflict grievous bodily harm for the purpose of facilitating the
commission of any such offence, such as burglary or robbery, or to facilitate
the flight of an offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof
and death ensues from such injury, that would be

[Page 28]

murder. So that you see a
person might be guilty of murder in that sense, although he may not have had a
murderous intention in the common ordinary conception of that term. He may have
started out to commit a common indictable offence and may have armed himself
for that purpose, in order to assist in committing the offence or to assist in
his escape.

*                             *                      *                      *                      *

It has been pointed out to you in
the address by counsel for the Crown, and quite properly, that while there is
always under our administration of justice a presumption that a man is innocent
until he is proved guilty, that is modified by another rule of evidence — that
there may corns a time when the inculpatory facts, may be so numerous and so
strong in their hearing that the onus shifts on to him, then. That was really
the form which this trial took. You had the evidence of a confessed
accomplice in the burglary and who was with him at the time of the shooting, if
true, and you have a complete history given of their proceedings that night at
the time they left the shack, and the defendant has recognized that, and he has
gone into the witness box and has told a story.

*                            *                       *                      *                      *

He has said that on the night in
question he was drunk; he does not remember when he went to bed. He
corroborates Jasbec in the fact that he, Jasbec, and his wife were at his house
that night. He does not say that he slept with Jasbec in the kitchen, but he
says that in the morning he was in his bedroom with his wife, and his wife says
the same thing.

*                            *                       *                      *                      *

You have heard the whole of the
evidence, and if you come to the conclusion he did go out, as Jasbec says, that
night and that that 12-bore double-barrelled shotgun of Jasbec's was taken with
them and that that was the instrument which caused the death of the policeman,
Willmett, then you will consider that, in relation to the explanation I have
given you as to the law which applies to people who go out and commit an
indictable offence and take firearms with them and kill a man either in
effecting the purpose of committing that offence, or in trying to escape.

I am bound to say to you and
instruct you that there seem to be only two conclusions you can come to, that
is, a verdict of guilty of murder or a verdict of not guilty. I cannot see
where you could consider the question of manslaughter at all in view of the
statement of Eberts himself.

*                            *                       *                      *                      *

It will be your duty then, having
regard to the explanation I have given of the law and the way in which you will
proceed to treat the evidence, to come to a conclusion as to whether Jasbec's
story of the happenings of that night, from the time they left the shack until
the time they got back is substantially the true story, because if it is

[Page 29]

there is then.no explanation
from the defendant that would enable me to give you any other instructions than
what I have given you, namely, to find a verdict of guilty against him, that
is, if Jasbec's story, that they started out and went to the Canadian
Pacific Railway freight sheds first and then went around by P. Burns's store,
and then around behind the Imperial Hotel, and that they had a gun with them
and that the accused asked for the gun and got it at the time they saw the shadow,
or what they thought was the shadow of a man, and Jasbec heard the shot, and
the other evidence given by these other people, that they heard a shot then
— leaves it in the position that, if Jasbec's story is substantially true in
regard to these important features of the happenings that night — then there
is no alternative for you but to bring in a verdict of guilty.

*                         *                       *                      *                      *

THE COURT:—The rule was
well known, and has been explained by me to the jury that if they believe
beyond a reasonable doubt, as reasonable men using the common sense and
intellect that reasonable men use in the affairs of life, especially in
relation to serious matters — using that common sense, — if they, as
reasonable men, believe that the story told by Jasbec is the true one, there is
no alternative for them but to bring in the verdict I have indicated — the
verdict of guilty: if they have a reasonable doubt as to the truth of
that story, so far as it implicates Eberts, they will give Eberts the benefit
of that reasonable doubt.

It cannot be doubted that, from these passages, the jury would
take the view that their sole task was to decide whether they should believe
Jasbec's story in respect of the incidents specified by the learned judge
himself, and, if they did so, it was their duty to find a verdict of guilty.

I shall presently call attention to the passages in the evidence
of Jasbec and his wife which I think the jury ought to have been asked to
consider but, in the meantime, it is convenient to observe that the charge of
the learned trial judge seems calculated to mislead the jury in the important
point of the burden of proof. The onus was on the Crown to establish the guilt
of the prisoner, to produce evidence, that is to say, which should satisfy the
jury beyond any real doubt that the prisoner was guilty of murder. It is

[Page 30]

quite true that the proof of homicide
alone by the prisoner might constitute a primâ facie case, and a very
strong primâ facie case against him. But if, in proving the homicide,
evidence of its circumstances and incidents was given of such a character as
properly to raise in the minds of the jury a real doubt as to the prisoner's
guilt, it would then be their duty to acquit. In criminal cases (it is needless
to observe) the degree of certitude at which a jury ought to arrive before
finding the issue of guilty or not guilty against the accused is higher than
that which is measured by the criterion of the preponderance of evidence or
balance of probability applied in civil cases. In Rex v. Stoddart[29],
at pages 243 and 244, the principles governing the incidence of the burden
of proof in criminal trials are stated in these words:—

It seems to the court that the
jury ought to have been told that the prosecution having given primâ facie evidence
from which the guilt of the defendant might be presumed, and which, therefore,
called for explanation by the defendant, the jury ought to consider the
evidence upon both sides, and if, upon a review of the whole of the evidence,
they were satisfied that the prosecution had made out the case that the
defendant Stoddart was a party to the conspiracy, they should convict him, but
that, if their minds were left in a state of doubt, they ought to acquit him,
as the burden of proving the defendant's guilt was still upon the prosecution.
The passages which have been cited at length are the only passages in the
summing up which bear directly upon the question of the onus of proof. The
concluding words of caution at the end of the summing up cannot be said to
qualify the specific direction to which attention has been called. In the
opinion of the court the jury may have thought that if Stoddart had not proved
that he had supplied moneys in every case they must convict him, whereas the
direction ought to have been that they must be satisfied, after consideration
of all the evidence, that the Crown had proved that Stoddart was a party to the
conspiracy, and, if in doubt, they ought to acquit him. It is in failing to
adequately explain this that the court is of opinion that there was a
substantial misdirection.

[Page 31]

The learned trial judge seems, (as appears from the extracts
quoted from his charge,) to have thought that if the jury were once convinced
that the prisoner was the author of the homicide that was the end of the case,
because evidence of facts justifying his act or reducing his crime to
manslaughter must come from the prisoner alone. That, of course, was equivalent
to withdrawing from the jury all the circumstances disclosed by the evidence of
Jasbec or Jasbec's wife bearing upon the degree of culpability which ought to
be attached to the prisoner's act, assuming the homicide to have been his act.

Before going into that evidence, (of Jasbec and his wife,) there
are two material observations.

1st. The prisoner's statements to these two witnesses having been
put in evidence by the Crown they became evidence in his favour as well as
against him. In Rex v. Higgins[30], Parke
J. said:—

Now, what a prisoner says is not
evidence, unless the prosecutor chooses to make it so, by using it as a part of
his case against the prisoner; however, if the prosecutor makes the prisoner's
declaration evidence, it then becomes evidence for the prisoner, as well as
against him; but still, like all evidence given in any case, it is for you to say
whether you believe it.

It was for the jury to say how much of the prisoner's statement
they accepted as true, but the Crown having offered the statement and got it
before the jury it was the duty of the jury to consider the statement as a
whole, and the consideration of it as a whole could not properly be withdrawn
from them; 2ndly. It was for the jury to say how much they were to believe of
the accounts which Jasbec and his wife gave of the prisoner's statements to
them. They

[Page 32]

might believe parts of those accounts,
reject other parts.

The jurors are not bound to
believe the evidence of any witness; they are not bound to believe the whole of
the evidence of any witness. They may believe that part of a witness's evidence
which makes for the party who calls him, and disbelieve that part of his
evidence which makes against the party who calls him. Per Lord
Blackburn, in Dublin, Wicklow, and Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery[31],
at page 12.01.

The point I have to discuss is whether,
on any reasonable view of the evidence of Jasbec and his wife, (bearing in mind
these principles,) the minds of the jury might, under proper instruction from
the court, have been brought into a real state of doubt as to the guilt of the
prisoner. Mrs. Jasbec's account of Eberts's statement is as follows:—

Fritz Eberts said he was out with
my husband that night, but he got bad luck; when he came round the corner
the policeman standing right before him and the policeman takes a revolver and
put it right in his face and say, ""Go to hell"" but he came before and
he shoot.

Q. Who shoot ?

A. Fritz Eberts shoot.

Q. Shoot who ?

A. Shoot the policeman.

Q. Do you remember anything else ?

A. He says, ""Good I kill him right away — it is good
that I kill him."" He said that, too.

Q. Is there anything else you remember ? I know it is a long
time ago. Did you have any other conversation with Eberts and his wife, when
they were together, or was that the only time ?

A. That was the only time.

Q. That was the only time Eberts spoke to you about the policeman
?

A. Yes.

Q. That was on the Sunday that you heard of it ?

A. Yes.

Q. And had you already heard that the policeman was
killed at that time or not ?

A. Yes; I heard it all right.

[Page 33]

Jasbec's account is this:—

Q. Did you have any talk with him ?

A. And then I asked him what is the matter. And he said:
""When I came around that corner first I saw nothing; all at once a fellow
standing in front of me and he pointed a revolver at me and said: What are
you doing here, go to hell,' and I thought he drawed his gun up and fired at
him""

Q. Who did ?

A. Eberts took his gun up and fired at the fellow who
pointed the revolver at him.

Q. Did you say anything more to him about it ? What was next
said by either of you after that ? What was next said ? Did you ask him
anything then ? He said he drew his gun and fired at him ? He said he drew his
gun up and fired at the man ?

A. And I said: ""What became of him ?"" and he said
he shot him — he shot the follow and he must be dead because he sank down as
soon as the shot was fired, without a sound.

Q. Did he say anything else about that man to you at that
time ?

A. Yes.

Q. What did he say ?

A. He said: ""I guess it is one of the secret-police,
but I am not sure about it."" That is what he said.

I shall assume for the moment that this evidence was evidence
which the jury ought to have considered. On that assumption the trial judge
would, of course, have instructed the jury that the first question to which
they ought to apply their minds was how much of these two conversations really
occurred; how far are the statements attributed to Eberts to be ascribed to him
? Both witnesses were speaking of conversations which had occurred four years
before. Jasbec himself had been under arrest for five months and having regard
to the suspicions attaching to him, (it was his gun, it will be remembered,
from which the shot was alleged to have been fired,) a jury would be acting
wisely in examining his testimony with critical care, even with suspicion, and
no lawyer would, of course, dispute that the question of what Eberts did really
say in the course of these conversations was a

[Page 34]

question exclusively within the province
of the jury. Did Eberts, for example, say to Jasbec, ""I guess it is one of
the secret-police ?"" Did he, in talking to Mrs. Jasbec, express
satisfaction in having killed a police officer ? At the preliminary hearing
Mrs. Jasbec had not recalled this part of the conversation. It is quite within
the bounds of reasonable possibility that the jury might have rejected this
part of the story altogether; or may have felt it to be of too doubtful credit
to be acted on with safety. Assuming them to have reached that conclusion, let
us examine the effect of these statements, in the light of the other evidence
placed before the jury by the Crown, to see if there is any substantial
foundation in them for the suggestion that the prisoner acted under such
provocation or such reasonable fear of harm as to make it proper that the
jury's attention should be directed to them.

There was, I may repeat, abundance of evidence from which the
jury might have reached the conclusion that, when they saw the figure of the
man who was shot, they had abandoned their criminal project and were on their
way home. However little such a conclusion may commend itself to one's own
judgment, Jasbec's own evidence is perfectly clear upon the point; and Jasbec
had been put forward by the Crown as a credible witness. In his
cross-examination, he says:—

Q. When you told Eberts that you had better go home Eberts
agreed to go ?

A. Yes.

Q. And he put the screw back in the door ?

A. Yes.

Q. And you started for home ?

A. Yes.

Q. And he agreed to do that ?

A. Yes.

[Page 35]

This is entirely consistent with the testimony given by him on
his examination in chief. Again, his evidence is precise to the effect that
Eberts thought the man they had seen was their friend Jan. If the jury accepted
this part of Jasbec's testimony the situation they would have to consider was
this — Eberts in these circumstances setting out to accost his friend Jan.
suddenly meeting a stranger who, to use the language of the wife, ""takes a
revolver and put it right in his face,"" and Eberts shooting. These are the
bald facts presented by this story. But there is another, and a most important
piece of evidence, touching the state of Eberts's mind, furnished by Eberts's
statement to Mrs. Jasbec, as repeated by her. Her report of Eberts's words is
this:—

Fritz Eberts said be was out with my husband that night, but
he got bad luck; when he came round the corner the policeman standing right
before him and the policeman takes a revolver and put it right in his face and
say, ""Go to hell"" but he come before and he shoot.

There can be no possible doubt that if the jury believed these
words to have been used by Eberts they were entitled to regard them as
indicating that Eberts acted in response to and in defence against a sudden
assault with a pistol. A good deal was made on the argument of the exclamation,
""Go to hell."" But the effect of such an exclamation upon a man in
Eberts's position would depend wholly upon the attitude of the person uttering
it, and it is to be observed, moreover, that Jasbec admitted upon
cross-examination that it was not until after he had told his story to the
police that he recalled the use of this expression. The jury might, in the
circumstances, consider this part of the evidence to be negli-

[Page 36]

gible. The fact, it may be added, that
there were lawless, not to say desperate, men about is a circumstance which
weighs as much at least in favour of the suggestions made on behalf of the
prisoner as against him.

Weighing all the relevant considerations I am unable to convince
myself that a jury properly instructed might not reasonably have taken a view
of this evidence which would afford a foundation for real doubt as to the
propriety of convicting the prisoner of the capital offence. I take it to be
indisputable that, where a homicide follows instantaneously upon acts which may
be a sufficient provocation to take the act of the accused out of the category
of murder, it is a question of fact for the jury whether in the particular case
there was such provocation. Criminal Code , sec. 261 . It is said that there is
no evidence here of passion; but, where provocation is proved, is it to be said
that a jury is bound to convict of murder, as a matter of law, in the absence
of express evidence of passion outside of the act of homicide itself ? That is
an impossible proposition. If the circumstances are such as legitimately to
raise in the minds of the jury a real doubt as to the presence of malice, in
the legal sense, then it is the duty of the jury not to convict of murder. Is
it to be laid down as a proposition of law that the presenting of a pistol, in
such circumstances as those we are considering, cannot properly afford a
foundation for such a doubt ? The case is perhaps stronger in support of the
suggestion that the appellant acted in reasonable fear of bodily harm, A court
of appeal would, however, be assuming a very grave responsibility, if, finding
in the record, evidence of circumstances

[Page 37]

which ought to have been considered by
the jury as bearing upon the question whether the accused had acted in
self-defence in response to a sudden assault, it should say, as a matter of
law, that these circumstances could afford no basis for a defence on the ground
of provocation. To draw the line between the effect of acts and words such as
those attributed to the unfortunate victim in producing such a state of passion
as would constitute provocation within the meaning of the law and their effect
in producing a reasonable fear of bodily harm such as would afford a ground for
justification would be a feat of some difficulty, and one which a court of
appeal could rarely attempt with safety.

I suppose, indeed, that no one would argue that these
circumstances ought not to have been considered by the jury had it not been for
the fact that Eberts himself went into the witness box and denied all knowledge
of the facts alleged against him. That he did so is undoubtedly a circumstance
which would tell powerfully with any tribunal, and properly so, of course,
against the defence now suggested. But I am quite unable to bring my mind to
the conclusion that the weight to be attributed to that circumstance was not
altogether a matter for the consideration of the jury.

Two points remain. As to the suggestion that Eberts's statements
point to action in self-defence and not to action as a result of provocation
and that, since the learned judge was asked to reserve a case only on the
latter point, it is not open to us to afford any relief, even assuming the
prisoner to have been deprived of the benefit of a defence fairly open on the
evidence — it will be unnecessary to repeat what I

[Page 38]

have said as to the bearing of the
circumstances in question upon the defence of manslaughter. But there is a
further observation to be made. The learned judge, as we have seen, ruled in
the most unmistakeable way that if the jury found the prisoner was the author
of the homicide then it was their duty to convict of murder; and the necessary
effect of that ruling was to withdraw from the jury all considerations arising
upon the prisoner's statements to Jasbec and his wife. He did not tell the jury
that on the whole case they must convict of murder or acquit. He told them in
effect that if they found the prisoner had killed the deceased it was their
duty to convict of murder. The statement of a case then, with regard to
manslaughter, in effect would raise the substantial question I have been
discussing, namely, whether assuming the prisoner to be the author of the
homicide there was any ground upon which a jury might reasonably entertain a
doubt as to whether he was guilty of murder.

The remaining question is whether it appears, in the language of
section 1019  of the Criminal Code , that there was any ""substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice."" It is contended by Mr. Johnson that the
prisoner having deliberately elected to stand upon an alibi cannot avail
himself of a defence which is open upon the evidence adduced by the Crown, but
which assumes his complicity in the homicide. In civil cases it is a rule
generally acted upon that, in order to prevent litigation going on forever, a
party who deliberately elects at the trial to fight his case out upon one issue
and gets beaten upon it cannot raise on appeal a new and totally different
issue, (which he did not put before the jury,) although it should be open upon
both the pleadings and the evidence;

[Page 39]

Browne v. Dunn[32].
I should desire to consider the question long and carefully before committing
myself to such a proposition as applied to prosecutions for criminal and
especially for capital offences. It is not easy to reconcile this contention
with the rule laid down in Reg. v. Gibson[33],
per Mathew J., at p. 543:—

We have to lay down a rule which
shall apply equally where the prisoner is defended by counsel and where he is
not,

In any case it has no application
here. It was stated in the argument by counsel for the prisoner and not
disputed that the issue of manslaughter was fully placed before the jury by
counsel, and, indeed, the suggestion that it was not would be incredible. Then
it is said that the evidence, as a whole, as it appears upon the record is
convincing of the prisoner's guilt, and that, since we can see that he was
rightly convicted, we are bound to hold that there had been no
""substantial wrong or miscarriage."" I cannot agree. The construction
of these words was authoritatively settled eighteen years ago by the Privy
Council in Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales[34].
Apart altogether from the binding force of the decision as an authority, the
reasoning of Lord Herschell at pages 69 and 70 is complete and conclusive. This
is the passage:—

The point of law involved is,
whether where the judge who tries a case reserves for the opinion of the court
the question whether evidence was improperly admitted, and the court comes to
the conclusion that it was not legally admissible, the court can, nevertheless,
affirm the judgment if it is of opinion that there was sufficient evidence to
support the conviction, independently of the evidence improperly admitted, and
that the accused was guilty of the offence with which he was charged.

It was admitted that it would not be competent for the court

[Page 40]

to take this course at common law,
but it was contended that section 423 of the ""Criminal Law (Amendment)
Act, 1883,"" (46 Vict. No.""17) empowered, if even it did not compel
the court to do so. That section is in these terms:—

""The judge by whom any such
question is reserved shall as soon as practicable state a case setting forth
the same with the facts and circumstances out of which every such question
arose and shall transmit such case to the judges of the Supreme Court, who
shall determine the questions and may affirm, amend or reverse the judgment
given or avoid or arrest the same or may order an entry to be made on the
record that the person convicted ought not to have been convicted or may make
such other order as justice requires. Provided that no conviction or judgment
thereon shall be reversed, arrested or avoided on any case so stated unless for
some substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice.""

Reliance was, of course, placed
upon the language of the proviso. It was said that if, without the inadmissible
evidence, there were evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict, and to shew
that the accused was guilty, there has been no substantial wrong or other
miscarriage of justice. It is obvious that the construction contended for
transfers from the jury to the court the determination of the question whether
the evidence — that is to say, what the law regards as evidence — established
the guilt of the accused. The result is that in a case where the accused has
the right to have his guilt or innocence tried by a jury, the judgment passed
upon him is made to depend not on the finding of the jury, but on the decision
of the court. The judges are, in truth, substituted for the jury, the verdict
becomes theirs and theirs alone, and is arrived at upon a perusal of the
evidence without any opportunity of seeing the demeanour of the witnesses and
weighing the evidence with the assistance which this affords.

It is impossible to deny that
such a change of the law would be a very serious one, and that the construction
which their Lordships are invited to put upon the enactment would gravely
affect the much-cherished right of trial by jury in criminal cases. The
evidence improperly admitted might have chiefly influenced the jury to return a
verdict of guilty, and the rest of the evidence which might appear to the court
sufficient to support the conviction might have been reasonably disbelieved by
the jury in view of the demeanour of the witnesses. Yet the court might, under
such circumstances, be justified or even consider themselves bound to let the
judgment and sentence stand.

These are startling consequences, which strongly tend, in
their Lordship's opinion, to shew that the language used in the proviso was not
intended to apply to circumstances such as those under consideration.

Their Lordships do not think it can properly be said that
there

[Page 41]

has been no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice where, on a point material to the guilt or innocence of
the accused, the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the
judge to consider in arriving at their verdict matters which ought not to have
been submitted to them.

In their Lordships' opinion, substantial wrong would be done
to the accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved
by legal evidence, and there were substituted for it the verdict of the court
founded merely upon a perusal of the evidence. It need (Scarcely be said that
there is ample scope for the operation of the proviso without applying it in
the manner contended for.

His Lordship is here dealing, of course, only with the case in
which inadmissible evidence has been admitted and has gone before the jury. His
observations, however, seem to apply with equal force to the case of a
misdirection in consequence of which relevant evidence has been withdrawn from
the consideration of the jury which might, under a proper instruction and not
unreasonably, bring their minds into a state of doubt as to the propriety of
the verdict at which they ultimately arrived. Such a misdirection is error
that, (since it deprives the accused of his constitutional right to have
submitted to the decision of a jury all the defences open to 'him on any
reasonable view of the evidence,) can only be corrected by setting aside the
verdict.

ANGLIN and BRODEUR JJ. concurred in the opinion stated by

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Criminal law—Trial for murder—Improper
admission of evidence— New trial—Substantial wrong or miscarriage—Criminal
Code , s. 1019 .

By section 1019 of the ""Criminal
Code "" it is provided that ""no conviction shall be set aside or any
new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly
admitted or rejected or that something not according to law was done at the
trial, * * * unless, in the opinion of the court of appeal, some substantial
wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial.""

Held, reversing
the judgment appealed from (16 B.C. Rep. 9), Davies and Idington JJ.
dissenting, that where evidence has been improperly admitted or something not
according to law has been done at the trial which may have operated
prejudicially to the accused upon a material issue, although it has not been
and cannot be shewn that it did, in fact, so operate, and although the evidence
which was properly admitted at the trial warranted the conviction, the court of
appeal may order a new trial.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia[1],
affirming the conviction of the appellant, at the trial, on an indictment for
murder, upon a reserved case stated by the judge who presided at the trial.

The case reserved is stated in the judgments
now reported.

[Page 332]

J. A. Ritchie for
the appellant.

McKay K.C. for
the respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—I did not intend to add anything to what I
said when judgment was rendered on this appeal; but in deference to the learned
opinions of my dissenting brothers I will endeavour to state the reasons for
the conclusions I reached.

The appellant, a soldier in garrison at
Victoria, B.C., was tried, at the last Autumn assizes, on the charge of
murdering his captain, one Peter Elliston; and, having been found guilty, was
sentenced to be hanged. Subsequently, on the application of counsel, the
learned Chief Justice, who presided at the trial, reserved a case for the
opinion of the provincial Court of Appeal. The point reserved is stated in
these words:

At the said trial the accused gave evidence
on his own behalf, and during his cross-examination by Mr. Aikman, the counsel
for the Grown, the following occurred as appears by the transcript of the
evidence hereto made by the official stenographer present at the said trial, at
page 100 thereof:—

Mr. Aikman: Q. You remember Corrigan giving
his evidence in the Police Court, don't you?

A. Yes, sir. Well I remember some of it,
sir. Most of it was given in. a very low tone of voice, sir.

Q. Do you remember him saying this, in
answer to a question of, what did Allen say, the answer was, ""He
threatened Captain Elliston, he said old Peter should be in charge of a ranch
instead of a body of men.""

A. Well, now, sir, that is an expression
that I would not be guilty of using.

Q. That is not the question; I ask you if
you remember him saying that?

A. No, sir.

Q. You don't remember him saying that?

A. Oh, I remember him saying that, sir, in
his evidence that morning.

Q. Then he was asked this question:
""Did he say he was done

[Page 333]

an injustice; give his words? (A.) He said
he was treated harshly by Captain Elliston; he said he had a bullet for Captain
Elliston; and every bullet had its billet, and he had one that would find its
mark."" Do you remember him saying that? 

A. No, sir, I don't remember him saying
that; but I can say from that, that is all nonsensical. No man of common
sense   *    *    *

Q. We will see that later.

Mr. Davie: I object to that evidence being
introduced here. The evidence of that man was taken at the preliminary inquiry,
and it has not been shewn that he is absent from the country. It is only an
indirect way of getting that evidence in.

The Court: Unless you can produce Corrigan
to be cross-examined himself, why should you use this evidence here?

Mr. Aikman: I am just testing this
witness's veracity and trying to test his memory.

Mr. Davie: I submit he has no right to
mention those statements.

The Court: No, I do not see what the point is.
You must test him by standard methods.

No further allusion was made to this matter by
either the counsel or myself.

The Court of Appeal decided, Mr. Justice Irving
dissenting, that the evidence objected to, although improperly admitted, in the
opinion of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Galliher, did the accused no
substantial wrong, there being abundant legal evidence of guilt. From that
decision this appeal is taken.

All the judges below find that there was ample
evidence that the prisoner killed Captain Elliston and in that opinion we
concur. The question to be determined, however, is with respect to the
admissibility of the testimony quoted in the reserved case and its effect upon
the verdict.

It cannot be doubted that depositions taken at
the preliminary inquiry before a magistrate are not admissible in evidence at
the subsequent trial of the accused on the same charge, except in certain
events; and when, on the happening of those events, such depositions are
admitted they must be produced in their entirety to the court so that the
accused and

[Page 334]

the Crown may have the benefit of all they
contain. It is also, I submit, undoubted law that, while, in the  circumstances
of this case, a prisoner might be asked  on cross-examination if he had made
previous threats against the life of his victim, the jury cannot, under
pretence of cross-examination for any purpose, be informed either directly or
indirectly by the Crown prosecutor that a witness examined at the preliminary
inquiry into the charge upon which the prisoner is tried swore at that
investigation that the prisoner  had  made such threats, unless that witness is
produced or his deposition given at the preliminary investigation is properly
admissible as evidence. The learned Chief Justice of the provincial Court of
Appeal, with whom Galliher J. concurred, describes what happened at the trial
on the cross-examination of the prisoner, in these words:

It appears that one Corrigan was a witness
and gave evidence at the preliminary investigation before the police
magistrate. Corrigan was not called at the trial, nor did the Crown comply with
the conditions precedent to its right to use Corrigan's evidence. Nevertheless,
counsel for the Crown asked the accused man, who went into the witness box on
his own behalf, whether Corrigan had not, in his evidence in the Police Court,
made a statement that he (Allen) had made threats against Captain Elliston of a
very serious nature. It was sought in this way to get before the jury
damaging statements made by Corrigan in the Police Court. This evidence
ought not to -have been permitted to reach the jury. The course pursued is not
in accord with the best practice of officers of the Crown charged with the
administration of justice. The argument advanced before us that counsel was
entitled in this way to test the credibility of Allen, cannot, in my opinion,
be accepted.

With all this I agree. The only question as to
which a doubt existed in my mind at the argument, was whether the improper
admission of this evidence was an irregularity so trivial that no substantial
wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned, there

[Page 335]

being other sufficient evidence of guilt. The
majority in the court below thought that the irregularity was trivial, that no
harm was done the prisoner and that by reason of the provisions of section 1019
of the Canada Criminal Code  the appeal should be dismissed. That section is in
these words:

1019. No conviction shall be set aside or
any new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly
admitted or rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the
trial or some misdirection given, unless, in the opinion of the court of
appeal, some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the
trial.

My difficulty is to say to what extent the jury,
or any one of them, may have been influenced by the questions put to the
prisoner on cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor. There are many reported
cases in which convictions have been quashed on the ground that illegal
evidence was admitted—often reluctantly, in view of the clear guilt of the
accused. The law on this express point was laid down quite recently in England
by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Fisher[2]. Speaking for the court, Channel J.
said:

In the circumstances of this case we cannot
come to any other conclusion but that the jury may have been influenced by the
evidence of the other cases, and, therefore, although there was sufficient
evidence to convict the prisoner without the evidence as to the other cases, in
accordance with the rule laid down in this court, the conviction cannot stand.

This case was subsequently formally approved in Rex
v. Ellis[3], at
page 760.

The English Act[4]
is in these words:

The Court of Criminal Appeal on any such
appeal against conviction shall allow the appeal if they think that the verdict
of the jury

[Page 336]

should be set aside on the ground that it
is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, or
that the judgment of the court before whom the appellant was convicted should
be set aside . on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of law or that
on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall
dismiss the appeal;

Provided that the court may,
notwithstanding that they are of opinion that the point raised in the appeal
might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if they
consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

There are, obviously, verbal distinctions which
can be made between the English Act and the section of our code. The English
statute enacts that the appeal shall be allowed in a certain number of
enumerated cases—including that of a verdict which cannot be supported
having regard to the evidence — and that in any others the appeal shall be
dismissed. As appears by the citation from Rex v. Fisher[5], that statute has been construed by the
Court of Criminal Appeals to mean that the conviction must be set aside where
improper evidence has been admitted — even if having regard to the whole
evidence there is sufficient to support the verdict. This is now the settled
rule notwithstanding the proviso to the English Act that the appeal may be
dismissed even if the point raised might be decided in favour of the appellant
if the court considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred.
Our section 1019 is practically to the same effect. It provides that no
conviction shall be set aside if it appears that some evidence was improperly
admitted unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice was thereby
occasioned. The underlying principle of both is that, while the court has a
discretion to exercise in cases where improper evidence has been admitted, that
discretion must be exercised in such a way as to do the prisoner no 

[Page 337]

substantial wrong or to occasion no miscarriage
of justice; and what greater wrong can be done a prisoner than to deprive him
of the benefit of a trial by a jury of his peers on a question of fact so
directly relevant to the issue as the one in question here — the existence of
previous threats—and to substitute therefor the decision of judges who have not
heard the evidence and who have never seen the prisoner? It may well be that in
our opinion sitting here in an atmosphere very different from that in which the
case was tried the evidence was quite sufficient, taken in its entirety, to
support the verdict, but can we say that the admittedly improper questions put
by the Crown prosecutor and the answers which the prisoner apparently very reluctantly
gave did not influence the jury in the conclusion they reached? We must not
overlook the fact that it is the free unbiassed verdict of the jury that the
accused was entitled to have.

Despite all the changes made in recent years in
the procedure in criminal and quasi-criminal cases, the classic saying of Lord
Hardwicke still holds that

it is the greatest consequence to the law
of England and to the subject that these powers of the judge and jury are kept
distinct, that the judge determines the law, and the jury the fact; and if ever
they come to be confounded it will prove the confusion and destruction of the
law of England.

In this case the Crown prosecutor first asked
the prisoner if he remembered that Corrigan gave his evidence in the Police
Court; and, when this was admitted, then he proceeded to ask him if he
remembered that he (Corrigan) then swore that the prisoner had threatened
Captain Elliston, saying:

Old Peter should be in charge of a ranch instead
of a body of men.

[Page 338]

This question being also answered in the affirmative,
the prisoner was asked if he remembered that at the preliminary investigation
Corrigan swore that he (the prisoner), speaking of the murdered man had used these
words:

He (the prisoner) said he was treated
harshly by Captain Elliston; he said he had a bullet for Captain Elliston; and
every bullet had its billet, and he had one that would find its mark.

This question was not answered, counsel for the
prisoner having intervened to object. In putting this question, the Crown
prosecutor appears to have read from the deposition given by Corrigan before
the police magistrate.

What must have been the impression necessarily
conveyed to the jury by those proceedings? The prisoner was pressed to admit:
First, that Corrigan was examined as a witness at the preliminary investigation
before the police magistrate; secondly. The Crown prosecutor stated that being
so examined he, Corrigan, testified that the prisoner had made against the life
of the deceased the threat quoted above. The result was that a material portion
of a deposition taken before the police magistrate was given to the jury
without the conditions of the Act being complied with; and that the jurors were
told by the Crown prosecutor in effect that a witness not produced and whose
absence was not accounted for had at the preliminary inquiry sworn to threats
made by the accused against the life of his victim. In my judgment, the
proceeding, objectionable as it is in this regard, is made more objectionable
by the fact that only extracts from the evidence was produced and that it does
not appear whether or not Corrigan was cross-examined as to the alleged
threats, so that it is impossible for us to say

[Page 339]

whether all that occurred between the prisoner
and Corrigan, on the occasion when the threats are said to have been made, was
before the jury. On the plea of not guilty the defence was that the murder was
committed under an insane impulse which was irresistible. Whether it is an
inference from the McNaghten rules that irresistible impulse is a sufficient
defence, I am not called upon to say, but certainly evidence of previous
threats made by the prisoner against the deceased would be a most effective answer-to
a plea of not guilty to a charge of murder; and I say, with all deference for
the opinion expressed by my colleagues for whose long experience and wide
knowledge I have the greatest respect, that to permit such threats to be proved
in the way attempted here would be to adopt ""a new and arbitrary method of
trial,"" and to dismiss the appeal we must ignore the well-settled rule
that in a criminal case the verdict is to be founded exclusively upon such
evidence as the law allows.

It was argued that the section of our Code, upon
which the Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal relied, specially provides that
the appeal shall be dismissed even where illegal evidence has been admitted, if
there is otherwise sufficient legal evidence of guilt. I cannot agree that the
effect of the section is to do more than, as I said before, give the judges on
an appeal a discretion which they may be trusted to exercise only where the
illegal evidence or other irregularities are so trivial that it may safely be
assumed that the jury was not influenced by it. If there is any doubt as to this
the prisoner must get the benefit of that doubt propter favorem vitce. To
say that we are in this case charged with the duty of deciding the extent to
which

[Page 340]

the improperly admitted evidence may have
influenced some of the jurors would be to hold, as I have already said, that
Parliament authorized us to deprive the accused in a capital case of the
benefit of a trial by jury. The law on this express point was laid down by the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1893 in Makin v. Attorney-General
for New South Wales[6], when
Lord Chancellor Herschell said:

It was said that if without the
inadmissible evidence there were evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict and
to shew that the accused was guilty, there has been no substantial wrong or
other miscarriage of justice. It is obvious that the construction transfers
from the jury to the court the determination of the question whether the
evidence—that is to say, what the law regards as evidence—established the guilt
of the accused. The result is that, in a case where the, accused has the right
to have his guilt or innocence tried by a jury, the judgment passed upon him is
made to depend not on the finding of the jury, but on the decision of the
court. The judges are in truth substituted for the jury, the verdict becomes
theirs and theirs alone, and is arrived at upon a perusal of the evidence without
any opportunity of seeing the demeanour of the witnesses and weighing the
evidence with the assistance which this affords.

It is impossible to deny that such a change
of the law would be a very serious one, and the construction which their
Lordships are invited to put upon the enactment would gravely affect the
much-cherished right of trial by jury in criminal cases. The evidence
improperly admitted might have chiefly affected the jury to return a verdict
of guilty, and the rest of the evidence which might appear to the court
sufficient to support the conviction might have been reasonably disbelieved
by the jury in view of the demeanour of the witnesses. Yet the court might,
under such circumstances, be justified, or even consider themselves bound to let
the judgment and sentence stand.    These are startling consequences.

*             *           *           *           *           *

Their Lordships do not think it can
properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice where, on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused,
the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to
consider, in arriving at their verdict, matters which ought not to have been
submitted to them. In their Lordship's opinion, substantial wrong would

[Page 341]

be done to the accused if he were
deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved by legal evidence, and
there were substituted for it the verdict of the court founded merely upon a
perusal of the evidence.

In that case the enactment in question was the
statute of New South Wales, 46 Vict., No. 17:

Provided that no conviction or judgment
thereon shall be reversed, arrested, or avoided on any case so stated unless
for some substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice.

On the whole I am of opinion that the appeal
must be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed, on the ground
that important evidence, which, in the circumstances, was inadmissible, was put
in by the Crown and this evidence may have influenced the verdict of the jury
and caused the accused substantial wrong, and that is the opinion of the
majority.

Davies J. (dissenting).—I am not able to agree with the conclusion reached
by a majority of the court to grant a new trial in this case.

The ground as I understand upon which the new
trial has been granted is the wrongful admission of evidence at the trial which
may have occasioned substantial wrong to the prisoner, Allen.

He was indicted on a charge of having murdered
Captain Peter Elliston, and pleaded not guilty. The fact of the killing by the
prisoner was proved by the Crown, and the defence, the only one in fact which
could under the evidence have been set up, was, as stated by his counsel to the
jury, that at the time the prisoner

committed the offence he was void of sane
consciousness and was temporarily insane.

Counsel for the prisoner frankly admitted at the
argument before us that no other defence than that

[Page 342]

of temporary insanity was or could have been
under the evidence advanced or sustained.

The jury found the prisoner guilty thus
negativing his only defence and after a careful perusal of the evidence given
at the trial, I am unable to see how reasonable men could have reached any
other conclusion. The question comes before us whether any evidence was
improperly admitted or ""something not according to law done at the
trial,"" which in our opinion occasioned some substantial wrong or
miscarriage to the prisoner on the trial.

The jurisdiction of the court acting as a court
of criminal appeal is defined and limited by the Criminal Code .   The 1019th
section reads as follows:

1019. No conviction shall be set aside nor
any new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly
admitted or rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the
trial or some misdirection given, unless, in the opinion of the Court of
Appeal, some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the
trial: Provided that if the court of appeal is of opinion that any challenge
for the defence was improperly disallowed, a new trial shall be granted.

The prisoner tendered himself as a witness and
gave evidence on his own behalf. In the course of his evidence replying to the
question of his own counsel: ""Tell the jury what you know of this
affair,"" said:

Well, I am afraid I shall be able to tell
them very little, because I am of opinion that the man who left here, that is
Corrigan—Corrigan came here the same as Trimby, with a manufactured statement,
he was not prepared at the time, apparently, and he came along here with a
rambling statement at the preliminary investigation; and I am of opinion that
Corrigan deserted as a consequence of being afraid to stand the cross-examination,
that he might have been subjected to.

Later on in his evidence he said that he had

a very strong suspicion that the man Corrigan
knows more about this, sir, than anybody else, and that is the reason he deserted;

[Page 343]

something tells me, sir, that that man
Corrigan acted crooked on that morning.

Having made these broad insinuations against
Corrigan, who was a deserter and supposed to be away out of the province, he
was naturally cross-examined with reference to his statements, and the following
appears in the case reserved by the Chief Justice who tried the case, as having
occurred during the cross-examination:

Mr. Aikman: Q. You remember Corrigan giving
his evidence in the Police Court, don't you?

A. Yes, sir. Well I remember some of it,
sir. Most of it was given in a very low tone of voice, sir.

Q. Do you remember him saying this, in
answer to a question of, what did Allen say, the answer was, ""He
threatened Captain Elliston, he said old Peter should be in charge of a ranch
instead of a body of men.""

A. Well, now, sir, that is an expression
that I would not be guilty of using.

Q. That is not the question; I ask you if
you remember him saying that?

A. No, sir.

Q. You don't remember him saying that?

A. Oh, I remember him saying that, sir, in
his evidence that morning.

Q. Then he was asked this question:
""Did he say he was done an injustice; give his words? (A.) He said he was
treated harshly by Captain Elliston; he said he had a bullet for Captain
Elliston; and every bullet had its billet, and he had one that would find its
mark."" Do you remember him saying that?

A. No, sir, I don't remember him saying
that; but I can say from that, that is all nonsensical. No man of common
sense     *    *    *

At this stage objection was taken by the prisoner's
counsel to the cross-examination as being an indirect way of getting in the
evidence of Corrigan given at the preliminary inquiry and the objection being
sustained by the Chief Justice, the cross-examination on the point was dropped.

I think myself the manner in which the Crown
prosecutor framed his questions objectionable and that

[Page 344]

the Chief Justice was right in sustaining the
objection. It is obvious, however, that the statements made by the prisoner in
his examination-in-chief quoted above fully justified cross-examination, and
that if there had been none legitimate comment might have been made at its
absence. The substance, however, of what took place is that the prisoner
admitted having heard Corrigan state that he, the prisoner, ""had threatened
Captain Elliston,"" but denied that he heard him state that prisoner had
made the specific threat counsel mentioned in his second question. The nature
of the general threat which he admitted having heard Corrigan state he,
prisoner, had made is not stated, and as to the specific threats he denied
having heard Corrigan's assumed statement respecting them.

It cannot be successfully argued in these
circumstances that any material evidence was admitted improperly or in fact
that any evidence at all was admitted. The Chief Justice at once ruled against
admitting the evidence.

The utmost that can be argued is that the
incident amounted to something which was ""done at the trial not according
to law,"" and which might have substantially prejudiced the prisoner.

I have already stated that in my opinion the
form of the questions was objectionable, and my concurrence in the Chief
Justice's ruling with regard to them at the trial.

The question remains: Did the putting of such
questions, in the circumstances and in view of the character of the defence
raised, occasion substantial wrong or miscarriage to the prisoner?

The duty of determining whether the facts which
happened did or did not occasion such substantial

[Page 345]

wrong rests under the statute upon the court. In
my judgment unless we are able to find that some substantial wrong or
miscarriage was so occasioned we are without any jurisdiction to interfere with
the verdict of the jury.

The statute was passed for the purpose of
putting an end to the judicial scandals occasioned by courts feeling themselves
obliged by authorities and precedents to give effect to trivial errors or
mistakes at criminal trials either with respect to the reception or rejection
of evidence, the conduct of the trial or the charge or rulings of the trial
judge, quite irrespective of the fact whether these errors or mistakes
occasioned substantial wrong or injustice to the prisoner or not.

Under the code as it now stands, all this is
changed, and the court is forbidden to set aside any conviction or to grant a
new trial unless in its opinion some substantial wrong or miscarriage was
occasioned by the alleged errors or mistakes in respect to the evidence, or the
conduct of the case or the ruling or direction of the trial judge as prescribed
in the section.

In order to discharge my duty in that regard I
have, as I have stated, read most carefully the entire evidence with the result
that I am unable to reach the conclusion that the occurrence or incident
objected to or the manner of putting the questions objected to could have
occasioned the prisoner any substantial injustice.

I had written my reasons out more fully on this
branch of the case, but in view of the fact that a majority of the court have
reached the conclusion that a new trial should be had, I thought it better to
state my conclusion generally, without going into the evidence in detail.

[Page 346]

We were pressed with the opinion expressed by
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Makin v. The
Attorney-General for New South Wales[7],
at pages 69 and .70, as to the proper construction of a section of the
""Criminal Law Amendment Act"" of that colony, conferring power upon
the Supreme Court on a stated case to deal with convictions of prisoners, etc.,
and containing a proviso

that no conviction should be
""reversed, arrested or avoided on any"" case so stated unless for some
substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice.

Although in view of the decision reached by them
that the evidence objected to in that case was admissible, it became
unnecessary for the determination of the appeal to decide upon the true
construction of this proviso, their Lordships thought it right, in the special
circumstances, to state their opinion that

the language used in the proviso was not intended
to apply to circumstances such as those now (then) under consideration; that is
cases of the wrongful reception of evidence. Their Lordships after giving
reasons for their opinion added: ""That there is ample scope for the
operation of the proviso without applying it in the manner contended
for.""' (and that) ''they desired to guard themselves against being
supposed to determine that the proviso may not be relied on in cases where it
is impossible to suppose that the evidence improperly admitted can have had any
influence on the verdict of the jury.

I have already given my reasons for thinking why
it is impossible to suppose that the improper manner in which the questions
objected to in this case were framed and put or the answers the prisoner made
to them could under the defence raised have had any influence on the verdict of
the jury.

But what I desire to point out is the radical
difference between the language of the New South Wales

[Page 347]

statute and ours. Ours expressly and explicitly
refers to cases where some evidence was improperly admitted or rejected, or something
not according to law done at the trial, and declares that in such cases
unless the court is of the opinion that some substantial wrong or miscarriage
was thereby occasioned on the trial no new trial should be directed or
conviction set aside. There is no such language or anything analogous to it in
the New South Wales statute upon the construction of which the Judicial
Committee gave their opinion, and no room in my humble judgment for applying
that opinion to our statute. Its language is so explicit, so definite, so
clear, as to leave no possible doubt in my mind of its meaning.

The Supreme Court of British Columbia in 1897,
in the case of Reg. v. Woods[8],
construed this section of the code now under review in accordance with the
views I have expressed. So also did the Appeal Court of Ontario in the case of Rex
v. Sunfield[9], where
it was held that although evidence of threats made by the prisoner in respect
of another person was improperly admitted, yet in the opinion of the court no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice having been occasioned thereby, the
conviction should not be set aside or a new trial directed.

For these reasons I am of the opinion that the
appeal should be dismissed.

Idington J. (dissenting).—The appellant was indicted for and convicted of
murder on a trial wherein the prosecution presented against him such a mass of
evidence, that the learned trial judge was constrained

[Page 348]

to describe it in his charge to the jury as
overwhelming, on the first issue raised by the plea of not guilty. At the close
of the case for the prosecution, the counsel for the accused opened his
client's case thus:

The evidence I will deduce will be to shew
that this man at the time he committed the offence was void of sane
consciousness and was temporarily insane. In order that all the evidence may be
before you enabling you to come to a proper conclusion, it is my intention to
submit the prisoner to you, in order that he may be examined. That is his wish,
and he will now take the box.

The accused was accordingly sworn on his own
behalf.

In the course of giving his evidence he spoke of
one Corrigan, a fellow soldier, in a way to cast suspicion upon him. Amongst
other things he referred to this man as follows:

Q. You might tell the jury what you know of
this affair?

A. Well, I am afraid I shall be ' able to
tell them very little because I am of opinion that the man who left here, that
is Corrigan—Corrigan came here the same as Trimby, with a manufactured
statement, he was not prepared at the time apparently, and he came along here
with a rambling statement at the preliminary investigation; and I am of the
opinion that Corrigan deserted as a consequence of being afraid to stand the cross-examination
that he might have been subjected to.    *    *    *

That is all, sir, because I had strong
suspicion of Corrigan. * * that that man Corrigan. acted crooked on that
morning. Because you see, sir, Corrigan was in hospital with me a few weeks previous
to this in the month of July, and nobody else was in then but Corrigan and me.

In the cross-examination there arose an
occurrence, no doubt due to these references, which appears in the reserve case
submitted to the Court of Appeal in British Columbia, and by way of appeal is
now before us,

In the reserve case the learned Chief Justice
who presided at the trial, introduces his statement of the conviction by these
words:

[Page 349]

2. The fact of the killing by the prisoner
was proved by the Crown, and the defence set up by the prisoner (namely,
temporary insanity caused by over-indulgence in alcohol) not having been
established to the satisfaction of the jury,"" etc, etc. 

In presenting the point desired to be raised the
learned Chief Justice gives the following part of the cross-examination, to
which I have already alluded:

Mr. Aikman: Q. You remember Corrigan giving
his evidence in the Police Court, don't you?

A. Yes, sir. Well I remember some of it,
sir. Most of it was given in a very low tone of voice, sir.

Q. Do you remember him saying this, in
answer to a question of, what did Allen say, the answer was, ""He
threatened Captain Ellis-ton, he said old Peter should be in charge of a ranch
instead of a body of men.""

A. Well, now, sir, that is an expression
that I would not be guilty of using.

Q. That is not the question; I ask if you
remember him saying that?

A. No, sir.

Q. You don't remember him saying that?

A. Oh, I remember him saying that, sir, in
his evidence that morning.

Q. Then he was asked this question:
""Did he say he was done an injustice; give his words? (A.) He said he was
treated harshly by Captain Elliston; he said he had a bullet for Captain
Elliston; and every bullet had its billet, and he had one that would find its
mark."" Do you remember him saying that?

A. No, sir, I don't remember him saying
that; but I can say from that, that is all nonsensical. No man of common
sense   *    *    *

Q. We will see that later.

Mr. Davie: I object to that evidence being
introduced here. The evidence of that man was taken at the preliminary inquiry,
and it has not been shewn that he is absent from the country. It is only an
indirect way of getting that evidence in.

The Court: Unless you can produce Corrigan
to be cross-examined himself, why should you use this evidence here?

Mr. Aikman: I am just testing this
witness's veracity and trying to test his memory.

Mr. Davie: I submit he has no right to
mention those statements.

The Court: No, I do not see what the point
is. You must test him by standard methods.

[Page 350]

Then the learned Chief Justice submits that with
the following remark:

No further allusion was made to this matter
by either the counsel or myself. Mr. Davie urges that this occurrence entitles
the prisoner to a new trial, notwithstanding all the evidence adduced, and the
question for the court is whether or not this contention is right.

It is somewhat difficult to understand how this
can be held of any consequence in this case.

Counsel for the appellant frankly puts it that
it is not the reception of evidence he complains of, but merely the form of the
questions put by the Crown officer, containing something impliedly, it is said,
sworn to elsewhere.

The relative importance or insignificance of
anything of that kind must be measured by the attendant circumstances of each
case and the possible bearing it may have upon the issues that have been
raised.

It certainly does not seem to me to be law that
one accused and giving evidence on his own behalf can be permitted to use the
occasion in order to traduce others and mislead a jury by such insinuations as
this witness chose to introduce in his evidence, and the Crown officer be
forbidden to elicit from him the motive for his conduct in making such
allegations as I have quoted.

For that purpose the Crown officer would have
been perfectly justified in order to shew the animus of the accused in making
such insinuations; to have adverted to the circumstances of Corrigan appearing
as against the accused in the preliminary investigation and the tenor of his evidence
there, and that accused learned or knew thereof, and that this, no doubt, gave
rise to such counter charge as made by the accused. He was entitled to have
elicited from the witness, and

[Page 351]

did thus elicit from him, ample motive for his
making the insinuations he did. The accused in cases where he creates thus the
occasion for a Crown officer resorting to what might otherwise have been
dangerous ground to enter upon, has no right to complain of the necessary
consequences of his own acts as a witness. He has no greater right than another
witness except so far as given by statute.

The accused did not hear, though present, the
later statement, and his denial being the only evidence before the court and
jury, as to whether or not such a statement ever had been made, must have been
taken, and no doubt was taken, as conclusive.

Again, as to the first statement as to threat or
fact, it was simply a repetition of what others had already sworn to on the
trial herein.

Neither statement in the case can be said to
have had any effect relative to the main issue of fact as to which the defence
had then practically been abandoned by this appellant's counsel.

For that reason it might have been as well that
the matter had been avoided entirely by the Crown officer. And, unfortunately,
when he was asked by the court why he pursued this line of cross-examination,
he gave a reason that does not seem to me as tenable as that I have suggested
as clearly available. But this reason he assigned can have no bearing upon the
substantial right to shew the animus of the accused.

Is it because a wrong reason is given or weaker
ground than he might have insisted upon is taken by a Crown officer, that the
accused should have his discharge, or be granted a new trial?

There was no objection taken to these questions

[Page 352]

as should have been by counsel for the accused
if he intended to object, or ever supposed his client likely to suffer from
these questions or answers thereto. And when taken a moment or two later, it
was clear to the jury and every one else that the learned Chief Justice had
stamped this course of inquiry as null.

It seems further (from the request he made at
the close of his charge, for any objections thereto, and counsel for accused
signifying he had none), to be clear that if he had attached the slightest
importance to the circumstances now complained of, he would have asked for a
direction to the jury relative thereto.

It may be observed that the only issue before
the court and jury at this stage of the inquiry was that of the insanity of the
accused.

In relation to that the Crown officer suggested
that he had asked these questions as a means of testing the memory of the
accused, and seeing that he had sworn to a complete lapse of memory of what
occurred at the time of the shooting, what was amiss in this that took place
shortly after being applied as a test? Beyond that the jury, if they ever
thought of it again, could only reasonably apply the answers as tests of
memory. And so far from militating against the accused, the result may have
tended the other way.

The appeal in criminal cases like this where no
motion was made in arrest of judgment rests upon section 1014  of the Criminal
Code , sub-section 2 . And that is confined to questions of law

arising either on the trial or on any of
the proceedings, subsequent, or incidental thereto, or arising out of the
direction of the judge. 

I doubt much if the mere statement of a question
unobjected to, as here, can be said to be a question of law arising at the
trial.

[Page 353]

I do not overlook the fact that in an English
case where a grave miscarriage had taken place without objection, the right to
have a case reserved was held not to be taken away by reason of omission to
object.

It is one thing in the case of a grave
misconception of the conduct of an entire trial, or a great part thereof, to
relieve the accused from the ordinary result of a failure to object, and quite
another, where the very unimportance of the error caused both court and counsel
to overlook it, at the close of a two days' trial.

But where is the practice to end, if such
trivial incidents as in question here, happening unnoticed, can warrant a new
trial or discharge?

For example, hearsay evidence as apparent in
this case, despite the efforts of the court and counsel, may creep in. Is that
to be taken as a matter of law in any case, proper to reserve a case upon, and
a new trial or discharge result?

Let us turn to section 1018  of the Criminal
Code , for there, coupled with section 1019 , our duties herein are defined. It
(section 1018) reads in such a way as to imply there had been a ruling from
which an appeal has been taken. How can that be said in regard to every
inadvertence that the most competent trial judge may happen to permit, and
where no call has been made for a ruling?

Where the matter is so grave that either he must
be taken to have misapprehended the entire nature of the business he was about,
and hence to have erred or have permitted others to err, it may well be argued
that there has been a ruling which rendered the omission to object of no
consequence.

But what is there here?

[Page 354]

A correct interpretation of section 1019,
however, is the most important thing we have to deal with herein. It reads as
follows:

1019. No conviction shall be set aside nor
any new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly
admitted or rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the
trial or some misdirection given, unless, in the opinion of the Court of
Appeal, some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the
trial; provided that if the Court of Appeal is of opinion that any challenge
for the defence was improperly disallowed, a new trial shall be granted.

To give this section an interpretation such as
to allow this appeal, is not only tantamount to an evasion or abandonment of
all responsibility such as has been cast by the plain wording of the section,
upon the appellate courts of Canada, but also a direction to every trial judge
at a criminal trial, then or after the trial, to reserve a case in every
instance of the occurrence of something of the like unimportant nature
happening on a criminal trial, in order that the accused be acquitted or tried
again.

The language of the section is of such a
comprehensive and imperative character, that clearly the appellate courts were
expected to be strong, and act with that strong hand that would protect the
interests of society, and the due administration of justice whilst guarding the
rights of the accused.

It is impossible in any single case to draw the
exact line of duty that will reach every case, if the appellate court is to
assume the responsibility and discharge the duty the section evidently
contemplates.

Of course it is not only possible, but easy, to
draw the line if we are content to say in this and every other case, that it is
impossible to say that any and every thing done, however insignificant, as
here, may not have had some effect on a jury.

[Page 355]

The case of Makin v. The
Attorney-General[10], is
relied upon and has been referred to in several cases since. I will not dwell
upon the curious features of that case, or the language of the judgment, but
may be permitted to say that some people seem to have misinterpreted it if my
reading of it is correct.

If we examine all the authorities from it down
to the latest, neither in it nor in any other case has any court gone to the
length, or nearly the length, we are asked to go herein.

But we have it interpreted by later authorities
in a way that seems quite consistent with the due working out of this section
of the Code.

I do not attach so much importance to the
difference of language in the various Acts on which cases have arisen, as some
do. But I may say ours is the most restrictive of any, in permitting the
setting aside of a conviction. I think we must have regard to the object of the
Act, and guard alike the just rights of the accused, and the danger of reducing
the administration of justice to a farce.

Experience on this side of the Atlantic has
been, from a variety of causes, so different from the experience an English
judge has had in his own country, as to render it necessary to take with
caution general expressions of such judges in disposing of the cases so far
reached under similar legislation. Possibly they have not felt as yet in
England the evil this section guards against.

We certainly are not expected, using the
language of Lord Alverstone, C.J., in Rex v. Dyson[11], at page 457, to transfer

[Page 356]

from the jury to the court the determination
of the question whether the evidence established the guilt of the accused.

His suggestion in the same case resting upon the
construction of the ""Criminal Appeal Act, 1907""[12], sec. 4, sub-sec. 1, is that the said

proviso is intended to apply to a case in
which the evidence is such that the jury must have found the prisoner guilty if
they had been properly directed. It does not apply when the evidence leaves it
in doubt whether they would have so found.

In the later case of Rex v. Norton[13], at page 501, the court uses the
expression ""would,"" not ""might,"" instead of
""must"" relative to the jury and its possible or probable discharge of
its duty.

I am unable to say that either word, standing
alone, can satisfy my mind. I assume either ""must"" or
""would"" implies the assumption that due regard be had to the
discharge of their duty by the jury as really what is meant by either
expression in each of these judicial opinions. In this case we ought not to
have, in light of either expression, the slightest difficulty. The only issue
raised is as to an occurrence at the stage of this trial when inquiry was being
made relative to the insanity of the accused. It seems absurd on the evidence
adduced to suppose that any sane jury could have honestly come to the
conclusion that the accused was at the time in question insane. We must bear in
mind the legal presumption of sanity, and that the onus of insanity at the time
rested upon the accused.

There is not a shred of evidence that goes so
far as to bring the accused within the range of any legal definition of
insanity, save that the evidence bearing on the long-continued drinking of the
accused, might

[Page 357]

render one suspicious of its having brought on
delirium  tremens or alcoholic dementia. And not only did the accused fail to
prove it had, but the only expert who saw him and could speak relative thereto,
and had ample opportunity to enable him to speak, is emphatic in saying he had
neither.

An acquittal in face of such evidence and none
on the other side, able to bear the test of our law relative to insanity and
its relation to responsibility in law, would have shocked every sensible man
who had heard this evidence.

I have read it all to be quite sure of my ground
in this case.

On the whole of it excluding any effect flowing
from the Crown officer's statements in question, it was the bounden duty of the
jury to convict.

To decide this case in a way to support this
appeal means to my mind the imposing as a legal duty on every trial judge in a
criminal case to note the most trifling irregular omission or occurrence liable
to happen on any trial, and reserve a case on such foundation for an appellate
court, and the imposing on such court the duty of discharging the accused or
directing a new trial.

It would render the insanity plea very popular.
For what bearing in the mind of any man could the above statement of counsel,
for it is that which is here complained of, ever have had in determining the
question of this man's sanity?

I think the appeal should be dismissed.

Since writing the foregoing, I am surprised by
the judgment of the majority of the court, placing the allowance of the appeal
on the ground of the improper admission of evidence.

[Page 358]

My note on the bench was this:

Mr. Ritchie confines whole to the point of
the counsel having stated in putting the questions the facts of statement
having been sworn to in Police Court.

Duff J.—I agree with the Chief Justice.

Anglin J.—I think it is incontrovertible that the references made by
counsel for the Crown, when cross-examining the defendant, to the Police Court
depositions of the absent witness Corrigan were improper. North Australian
Territory Co. v. Goldsborough, Mort and Co.[14], at page 385. Without laying a foundation
under section 999  of the Criminal Code , which was not done, these depositions
were inadmissible in evidence. The effect of the course taken by counsel for
the Crown was to place before the jury a part of this inadmissible evidence
which bears directly upon a question vital to the defence.

That the deceased had been killed by the
defendant was practically not contested, the only serious defence set up being
that, at the time the homicide was committed, the prisoner was not legally
responsible because his mental condition was such, owing to the effect of intoxicants,
that he was then incapable of criminal intent. If upon the evidence legally
admissible the proper conclusion was that the effect upon the prisoner of
liquor, though taken voluntarily, was such that, when he shot Captain Elliston,

his mind was so affected by the drink he
had taken that he was incapable of knowing that what he was doing was
dangerous, i.e., likely to inflict serious injury,

(Rex v. Meade[15], at page 899; Rex v. Blythe[16], at

[Page 359]

page 395) — that it produced a condition, mental
or physical, inconsistent with the inference that his act was intentional,
intent or premeditation being of the essence of the crime ( Russell on Crimes (
1 Can. ed. ), 88) —that temporal mental derangement at the time of the
commission of the offence was the result (Rex v. Baines, noted in
Wood-Renton on Lunacy, p. 912) — a verdict of acquittal, or perhaps of
manslaughter (Reg. v. Doherty[17],
at page 308), should be the result. But if the defendant had really formed a
previous determination to resent a slight affront in a barbarous manner,
""his mental state due to intoxicants might furnish no excuse:"" Rex
v. Thomas[18], at
page 820. Upon this question of premeditation—malice aforethought—which is of
the essence of the crime of murder, evidence of previous threats by the accused
against the deceased is most material. Proof of such threats would go far to
destroy the contention that his act was excusable because the use of liquor had
reduced him to such a condition that he was unable to restrain himself from
committing the act, or was deprived of the power of forming any specific
intention; Reg. v. Monkhouse[19],
at page 56. It is obvious that such threats, if shewn, would not improbably
lead a jury to discredit the only defence relied upon in this case.

If Corrigan's deposition had been received in
evidence at the trial without compliance with the requirements of section 999 
of the Criminal Code , I entertain no doubt that there would have been a
mistrial. The reading of such a material extract from it as was put to the
prisoner on his cross-examination by counsel

[Page 360]

for the Grown, accompanied as it was by the
statement that he was reading from the testimony of Corrigan at the preliminary
investigation, was quite as mischievous—quite as prejudicial to the accused— as
its formal reception in evidence could have been. ""Something not according
to law was done at the trial."" (Criminal Code , sec. 1019 .) The learned
trial judge did not, either then, or in subsequently charging the jury, tell
them that they must disregard the alleged threats to which Corrigan had
deposed—if indeed such a direction from him would have cured the mischief. Longhead
v.  Collingwood Shipbuilding Co.[20].

The fact that in his evidence in chief the
deceased had spontaneously referred to Corrigan's previous testimony,
challenging its accuracy and even hinting that Corrigan himself was not free
from suspicion in connection with the murder, in my opinion did not at all
justify counsel for the Grown in placing before the jury, under the guise of
questions in the cross-examination of the prisoner, material extracts from
Corrigan's deposition. An effective cross-examination might easily have been
conducted without resort being had to this indefensible practice.

Neither can I agree with the learned Chief Justice
of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia that the conduct of the Crown
counsel could not have prejudiced the interests of the defendant because there
was no evidence proper for submission to the jury on the question of his
irresponsibility at the time of the homicide. The evidence in support of this
defence may have been slight. Since this case must go before another jury I
refrain from discussing the question

[Page 361]

further than to say that there was in my opinion
enough for submission to the jury — enough to entitle the prisoner to have the
jury pass upon the issue raised by him, unaffected by matter not properly
admissible in evidence.

But it is said on behalf of the Crown that under
section 1019  of the Criminal Code  the conviction should not be set aside unless
the court is satisfied that the jury must have been influenced in
reaching their verdict by the matter improperly put before them. There being
other evidence sufficient to support the conviction, it is manifestly
impossible to say that the jury must have acted upon, or were in fact
influenced by, the matter which now forms the subject of the appellant's
objection. On the other hand, it is equally impossible to say that the minds of
the jury may not have been, or were not in fact, affected prejudicially
to the appellant by matter so pertinent to the main issue before
them—impossible indeed to say that it may not have been this matter which with
some juryman turned the scale against the defendant.

I cannot accept the construction of section 1019 
urged on behalf of the Crown. So construed, as pointed out in Makin v. Attorney-General
for New South Wales (1), it would in effect substitute the court for the
jury in

the determination of the question whether
the evidence—that is to say what the law regards as evidence — establishes the
guilt of the accused.

If Parliament had meant to effect such a
startling change in the law, language much more explicit would certainly have
been employed; The Lord Chancellor in the Makin Case[21] said:

[Page 362]

In their Lordships' opinion substantial
wrong would be done to the accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury
on the facts proved by legal evidence, and there were substituted for it the
verdict  of the court founded
merely upon a perusal of the evidence. It need scarcely be said that there is
ample scope for the operation of the proviso without applying it in the manner
contended for.

Although the express reference to the improper
admission of evidence made in section 1019 of our Code, as one of the grounds
upon which a verdict may be impeached, is not found in the New South Wales
statute dealt with by the Judicial Committee in the Makin Case[22], the direction of both Acts is
substantially the same, viz., that the appellate court shall not set aside the
verdict unless for some substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. In our
statute the court of appeal is required in certain specified cases not to
interfere unless in its opinion some substantial wrong or miscarriage was
occasioned by the error complained of; in the ""New South Wales Act""
interference is prohibited, whatever the ground of objection to the verdict,
unless for some substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice. I fail
to find any ground of real distinction between these statutory provisions. Reg.
v. Woods[23] was
on this point, in my opinion, wrongly decided; and I am, with respect, unable
to accept the view stated by Moss C.J.O., in Rex v. Sunfield[24], at page 258, that under section 1019 of
our Code the appellate court

is placed in a position quite different
from that occupied by the court in the case before the Judicial Committee.

The correct construction was put upon section
1019 of our Code by Dubuc and Killam JJ., in Beg. v. Hamilton[25], the
head-note to which is misleading, and by

[Page 363]

Osier J.A., in delivering the judgment of the
Ontario Court of Appeal, in Rex v. Brooks[26].

""A substantial wrong"" is
""occasioned thereby on the trial"" when counsel for the Crown
improperly places before the jury, as having been sworn to, statements which
may influence them adversely to the accused upon a material issue.

Although section 4, sub-section 1, of the
English ""Criminal Appeal Act of 1897"" does not so closely resemble
section 1019 of our Criminal Code  as does the New South Wales provision dealt with
by the Privy Council, it is not dissimilar and English decisions upon it are of
value because they shew that the principle of construction acted on in the Makin
Case[27] should
be applied in the interpretation of statutory provisions similar to that there
dealt with. Rex v. Dyson[28];
Rex v. Fisher[29], at page 153; Rex v. Norton[30], at page 501; Rex v. Ellis[31], at page 764.

In my opinion there must be a new trial of this
case.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.

Criminal law—Evidence—Verdict.

[Page 167]

Evidence making a prima facie case for the Crown in a
criminal prosecution, if unanswered and believed by the jury, is sufficient to
support a conviction of the person accused.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta
affirming the conviction of the appellant, at the trial, upon an indictment for
arson, on an appeal by special leave upon questions of law in respect of which
the trial judge, Stuart J., refused to reserve a case for the opinion of the
court in banco.

The following statement was made by the learned trial judge in
refusing the application for a reserved case by counsel for the appellant.

STUART J. — ""I refuse to reserve the following
questions for the opinion of the court, en banc, at the next sittings of
the said court to be holden at Calgary, in Alberta.

""(I.) Does the evidence merely point to a suspicion of guilt
instead of being the legal evidence necessary to support a conviction?

""(II.) Was I right in refusing to dismiss the

[Page 168]

charge against the accused at the close of the case for the Crown
upon application made by counsel for the accused ?

""(III.) Was the evidence of the witnesses McMinn and Mcintosh
as to the removal of certain horses alleged to be the property of Samuel Wilson
pursuant to an alleged arrangement with the said Wilson, properly admitted by
me, there being no evidence that the accused had any knowledge of any horses
being on the premises, of their removal, or of any such arrangement, and
objection being taken by counsel for the accused?

""(IV.) Was that portion of my charge to the jury being 'a
person who tells an untruth when not under oath is not a person who is likely
to be believed even when they are under oath' improper?

""(V.) Was that portion of my charge to the jury proper
being, 'people do peculiar things and yet is it a probable thing that she would
do — to leave a bundle of papers there in that store in a drawer which was
apparently unlocked for so long containing incriminating evidence against her
husband of his relations with another woman,' there being no evidence whatever
of the said papers containing any incriminating evidence?

""(VI.) Was I right in refusing to allow counsel for the
accused to have the said papers handed in to the jury while deliberating upon
their verdict unless so requested by the jury?""

A. A. McGillivray for the appellant.

Wallace Nesbitt K.C. and Christopher C. Robinson
for the respondent.

[Page 169]

The judgment of the court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE. — I have always understood the rule to
be that the Crown, in a criminal case, is not required to do more than produce
evidence which, if unanswered, and believed, is sufficient to raise a prima
facie case upon which the jury might be justified in finding a verdict. A
careful perusal of the evidence here satisfies me that there is evidence quite
sufficient to prove that the house was destroyed by a fire under circumstances
which clearly pointed to incendiarism, and that the accused might fairly be
presumed to have set the fire. When the Crown's case was closed, of the three
persons who had means of access to the building on the night of the fire two
had given their evidence, frankly and fully testifying to all that occurred;
the third, the accused, volunteered to go into the witness box and attempted to
explain away those things which were calculated to throw suspicion upon her. To
say the least, her explanation is not satisfactory. Her denials of facts that
are proved beyond all doubt are very much to her discredit. In any event, the
jury having had occasion to hear the story of the three persons who alone
admittedly might have caused the fire, and the theory of accident being
eliminated, came to the conclusion, on evidence which, in my opinion, was
sufficient, that the appellant was guilty of the offence with which she was
charged and no reason has been given here to justify us in setting that verdict
aside. The facts are so fully and clearly discussed in the judgments below that
I do not feel it necessary to say more.

On
Appeal From The Court Of Appeal For British Columbia

Criminal law—Appeal—Conviction
for manslaughter quashed by court of appeal—Leave to appeal to Supreme Court of
Canada—Sections 1013, 1021, 1011, 1024A Cr. Code—Appeal to court of appeal on
objection as to qualification of juror not raised at trial—Right of appeal to
court of appeal without leave—Court of appeal judgment conflicting with
judgment of another court of appeal in like case.

The Court of Appeal for British Columbia quashed a conviction for manslaughter on the ground of disqualification
of a juror by deafness, which disqualification that court found to be
established by evidence taken subsequent to the trial. The defendant had not
before the verdict raised objection as to the juror's qualification. The Court
of Appeal held that the question as to the deafness of the juror and its effect
in respect to the trial and conviction was a question of law only, and under s.
1013 (1)  (a) of the Criminal Code  an appeal to it lay without leave, and it
therefore refused leave to appeal as being unnecessary. The Attorney-General
for British Columbia moved for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada.

Held, that, having regard to clauses (b) and (c)
of s. 1013 (1) , and to s. 1011 , of the Criminal Code , the motion should be
favourably considered if the pre-requisite of jurisdiction to entertain the
projected appeal, viz., conflict between the judgment from which it was sought
to appeal and that of any other court of appeal in a like case (Criminal Code ,
s. 1024A) existed; that decisions prior to the enactment of s. 1013  in 1923 on
some of the matters covered by that section might properly be regarded as
having been rendered in like cases; that such conflict as aforesaid existed by
reason of the cases of Reg. v. Earl (10 Man. R. 303 ), and Rex
v. Battista (21 Can. Cr. Cases 1) ; and the motion should be granted.

MOTION under s. 1024A. of the
Criminal Code  by counsel representing the Attorney-General of British Columbia for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] setting aside the conviction of the defendant for
manslaughter. Leave to appeal was granted by the judgment now reported. The
subsequent judgment of this court on the merits has been already reported[2].

Geo. F. Henderson K.C. contra.

ANGLIN C.J.C.—Counsel
representing the Attorney General of British Columbia moves under s. 1024A of
the Criminal Code  (10-11 Geo. V., c. 43, s. 16) for leave to appeal from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia setting aside the conviction
of the defendant for manslaughter. The defendant appealed upon one notice of
appeal to the Court of Appeal under s. 1013  of the Criminal Code  (13-14 Geo. V,
c. 41, s. 9) on grounds of misdirection, non-direction and irregularities in
the course of the trial. He also appealed by a second notice on the ground that
two of the petit jurors—George Keown and Thomas Worledge—who sat on the trial,
were incapacitated by deafness from serving on the jury. Moreover, he at the
same time moved the Court of Appeal, on a third and distinct notice of appeal,
to quash the indictment on which he had been tried and convicted on the ground
that five of the jurors who sat on the alleged grand jury by which it was found
had not been ""summoned"" as grand jurors (Criminal Code , s. 921 ).

Notice of motion for leave to
appeal was given in connection with the matters covered by the notice of motion
first mentioned but not in connection with the alleged defects in the
constitution of the grand and petit juries. An application for leave to appeal
would appear to have been made, however, on the hearing of the appeal in
connection with the alleged disqualification of the petit jurors.

The court directed that separate
judgments should be pronounced by its several members. (Criminal Code , s. 1013
(5) ).

No allusion is made to the
subject matters of the notice of motion, first above referred to, in any of the
judgments of the appellate judges beyond the statement that error in the
judge's charge formed one of the grounds of appeal.

The Court of Appeal consisted of
five members. Two of the learned judges (Martin and M. A. Macdonald J.J.A.)
would have acceded to the motion to quash the indictment; two (Macdonald,
C.J.A. and Galliher, J.A.) 

[Page 483]

would have refused it;
McPhillips, J.A., while alluding to it as a ground of appeal, expresses no
opinion upon the alleged defect in the constitution of the grand jury.

The alleged disqualification of
the juror Worledge was either not pressed or was not regarded as of sufficient
importance to be noticed in the judgments delivered.

Three of the learned appellate
judges (Martin, Galliher and McPhillips) held that the question as to the
deafness of the juror Keown and its effect in respect to the trial and
conviction of the defendant was a question of law and not a question of fact or
a question of mixed fact and law and on that ground refused leave to appeal as
unnecessary. They found that the disqualification of Keown was established by
evidence taken subsequent to the trial—no doubt under s. 1021  of the Criminal
Code  (13-14 Geo. V, c. 41, s. 9) (and vide Rex v. Syme[3]
)— and on that ground quashed the conviction and directed a new trial. Mr.
Justice M. A. Macdonald expressed no opinion on this aspect of the case. The
learned Chief Justice dissented holding the question raised as to the
disqualification of Keown to be essentially a question of fact or of mixed fact
and law, on which an appeal does not lie without leave and that, under the
circumstances, which he details, leave to appeal should be refused.

The learned Chief Justice appears
to assume the competency of an appeal by leave on this ground; but does not
advert to the question, now raised by the Attorney General, whether such an
appeal, by the present defendant, is not precluded by the fact that he first
raised the objection to the disqualification of the jurors after the verdict.

The decision of the majority of
the court clearly involves an adjudication that such an appeal lies; that
failure to object to the jurors' disqualification before the verdict does not
debar the defendant from making it; and that the Court of Appeal may determine
the fact on which alleged disqualification of a juror is based on evidence
taken under s. 1021  of the Criminal Code . That the appeal involved merely a
question of law and therefore fell within clause (a) of s. 1013 (1)  and lay
without leave is distinctly affirmed by the formal order of the court. Upon
both

[Page 484]

points—the competency of the
appeal on an objection to the qualification of the jurors not raised at the
trial and the right to have brought the appeal without leave—the judgment from
which leave to appeal is now sought is asserted by counsel for the Attorney
General to conflict with judgments of other courts of appeal. (Criminal Code ,
s.2 (7) ).

Proceedings in error in criminal
cases and the procedure and practice in provincial courts of criminal appeal in
respect of motions for or the granting of new trials of persons convicted on
indictment have been entirely superseded (Criminal Code , s. 1013(3) ). The Court
of Appeal must, therefore, have dealt with the defendant's application in the
exercise of the appellate jurisdiction conferred on it by s. 1013(1) . Indeed
the Chief Justice said that 

redress in all cases like
the present one must be sought by an appeal only.

Having regard to the provisions
of clauses (b) and (c) of s. 1013(1)  in respect to the need of leave to appeal
and to the provisions of s. 1011 that no omission to observe the directions of
any Act as to (inter alia) the qualification of a juror shall be ground
for impeaching any verdict or shall be allowed for error on any appeal, I think
the application of the Attorney General for leave to appeal to this court
should be favourably considered if the pre-requisite of jurisdiction to
entertain the projected appeal, viz., conflict between the judgment from which
it is sought to appeal and that of any other court of appeal in a like case (s.
1024A), exists.

Section 1013  having been enacted
only in 1923, a conflicting judgment under it is scarcely to be looked for. But
earlier decisions on some of the matters covered by that section are in point
and may properly be regarded as having been rendered in like cases.

I regard the decision, in 1894,
of the Court of Queen's Bench in Manitoba—then the Court of Appeal for that
province (55-56 Vic., (D.) c. 29, s. 3 (e) )—in Regina v. Earl [4]
as sufficiently in consimili casu. The court there rejected an appeal
based on the ground, first raised after the trial, that one of the petit jurors
was unable to understand the language in which the trial had been conducted.
The observations of Killam, J., at pp. 312, 313,

[Page 485]

of Taylor, C.J., at p. 308 and of
Bain, J., at p. 317 are in point. I do not overlook the distinction between the
two cases that deafness is a ground of disqualification under the British Columbia statute (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 123, s. 6), whereas ignorance of English is
not a disqualification under the law of Manitoba.

On the question whether alleged
disqualification through deafness is a ground of appeal which falls within
clause (a) or within clause (b) of s. 1013(1) , the decision of the Court of
King's Bench (Que.) in Rex v. Battista (1) is in conflict with
the judgment now before us. The appeal there was based on the qualification of
a petit juror which it was held ""was a question of fact and not a question
of law"" and "" should have been raised before verdict was
rendered.""

But it may well be that the
questions of fact or of mixed fact and law covered by clause (b) are confined
to questions in issue between the Crown and the defendant on the trial and that
the ground of appeal in the present case arising out of the constitution of the
petit jury falls rather under clause (c). (Archbold Cr. PI. Ev. & Pr. (26th
Ed.) 338).

For these reasons leave to appeal
will be granted. I advisedly refrain from any observation affecting the merits
of the case to come before the court. The case may be set down as the first
case on the Western list for the session of this court commencing on the 5th of
May next.

Motion granted.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL OF BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Appeal to
Supreme Court of Canada—Cr. Code, ss. 1013 (5), 1024—Difference of opinion
in Court of Appeal—Absence of requisite direction under s. 1013 (5)—Misdescription
of count in judge's chorge to jury.

An appeal does not lie to this
Court under s. 1024 of the Cr. Code in the absence of the direction of
the court of appeal required by s. 1013 (5), which direction must be evidenced
by the order of the court and should be plainly expressed (Gouin v. The
King, [1926] S.C.R. 539); the plain operation and effect of s. 1013 (5) is
not only to maintain the restriction of the right of appeal conferred by s.
1024 to questions of law, but also to restrict the cases in which upon
questions of law lack of unanimity may be expressed to those in which the court
of appeal considers it in the interest of justice that separate judgments
should be pronounced by the members of the court (Davis v. The King,
[1924] S.C.R. 522).

At the trial on a charge of
perjury, the judge, when giving, near the conclusion of his address to the
jury, a short recapitulation of each count in the indictment, by a slip of the
tongue misdescribed a count (the one on which accused was found guilty), the
substance of which he had, just before, correctly stated to the jury. An appeal
from the accused's conviction to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia was
dismissed ([1927] 2 W.W.R. 300), the majority of the judges holding that,
notwithstanding the misstatement, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice had occurred. Two judges of the court expressed a different view on
this point and were in favour of allowing the appeal and granting a new trial.
On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on the ground of misdirection to the
jury:

Held, the appeal to this Court was not open to accused, by
reason of the absence of the requisite direction under s. 1013 (5) ; but, its
absence not having been brought to this Court's attention, and the appeal
having been heard on the merits, the Court expressed the view that, on the
merits, the appeal could not have succeeded. Quaere, whether, even had a
dissent been regularly and legally pronounced, a difference of opinion on such
a question should be considered as a dissent upon a question of law.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[1] dismissing an appeal from a conviction for perjury.

[Page 455]

The appellant was charged with
having, while a witness in a judicial proceeding, falsely and with intent to
mislead the magistrate holding the proceeding, deposed and sworn that (1) he
had not worked for one Joe Esposito during the year 1926; (2) he had not given
any evidence during the year 1926 with regard to Joe Esposito dealing in
liquor; and, (3) he did not know whether or not Joe Esposito had kept
intoxicating liquor for sale between the 1st January and the 21st May, 1926.
The jury found him guilty on the third count.

In his charge to the jury the
trial judge referred to the third count and stated it in substance correctly;
but, very shortly afterwards, near the close of his address, in giving a short
recapitulation of each count in the indictment, he misdescribed the third count
by stating it to be that the appellant had falsely sworn that "" he had not
given evidence with regard to Esposito having kept intoxicating liquor for
sale.""

The appellant appealed to the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia on a number of grounds, including that of
misdirection in reference to the third count. The appeal was dismissed[2].
The majority of the court were of opinion that, notwithstanding the said
misstatement, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred.
Martin and McPhillips JJA., however, expressed a different opinion on this
point and were in favour of allowing the appeal and granting a new trial.

The formal judgment of the Court
of Appeal read as follows:—

This appeal coming on for
hearing on the 5th and 6th days of January, A.D. 1927, before this Honourable
Court at Victoria, B.C., in the presence of Mr. Bruce Boyd of Counsel for the
Appellant and Mr. C. L. McAlpine of Counsel for the Respondent and upon hearing
read the Appeal Book herein and what was alleged by counsel aforesaid and
judgment being reserved until this day.

This Court doth order and
adjudge that this appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed.

The appellant appealed to the
Supreme Court of Canada, on the ground that the learned trial judge misdirected
the jury in reference to count 3 of the indictment, and that such misdirection
confused, or may have confused, the jury.

[Page 456]

E. F. Newcombe for the
appellant.

J A. Ritchie K.C. for the
respondent.

The judgment of the court was
delivered by

RINFRET J.—The appellant, de
Bortoli, was accused of perjury. Three different counts were laid against him
in the indictment. He was charged with having falsely and with intent to
mislead justice deposed and sworn that:—

1. He had not worked for one Joe
Esposito ;

2. He had not given evidence
during the year 1926 with regard to Joe Esposito dealing in liquor;

3. He did not know whether or not
Joe Esposito had kept intoxicating liquor for sale between the 1st January and
the 21st May, 1926.

The jury found him guilty on the
third count.

De Bortoli appealed on several
grounds. They were all dismissed by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia. After the argument was concluded, the Chief Justice, who presided,
declared that he would dismiss the appeal and would deliver his reasons later.
Then the other members of the court proceeded in turn to give their reasons,
two of the judges (Martin and McPhillips JJA.) being in favour of allowing the
appeal, the two others (Galliher and M. A. Macdonald JJA.) concurring with the
Chief Justice. The president of the court then announced: ""The appeal is
dismissed."" In due course, came to be signed the formal judgment in which
there is apparent neither dissent nor direction indicating that, in the opinion
of the court, any question raised upon the appeal was "" a question of law
on which it would be convenient that separate judgments should be pronounced by
the members of the Court."" (Crim. Code, s. 1013 (5)).

This Court, in Gouin v.
The King[3],
has already indicated that the direction required by ss. 5  of s. 1013  of the Criminal
Code  ""must be evidenced by the order of the Court and should be
plainly expressed."" It is further the unmistakable effect of our decision
in Davis v. The
King[4]

that the plain operation and
effect of subsection 5 is, not only to maintain the restriction of the right of
appeal conferred by section 1024 to

[Page 457]

questions of law, but also
to regulate the cases in which upon questions of law lack of unanimity may be
expressed so as to embrace only those cases in which the court of appeal
considers it in the interest of justice that separate judgments should be
pronounced by the members of the court.

Since Davis v. The
King[5],
s. 1024 was amended (15-16 Geo. V, c. 38, s. 27) and its language establishes
still more clearly that no appeal in criminal matters can be taken to this
Court except on a ""question of law on which there has been dissent in the
Court of Appeal."" This amendment only confirmed the uniform interpretation
which this Court had given to the former section.

Moreover, as was stated in the Davis
Case[6],
this Court could not ""acquire jurisdiction by a learned judge of the court
of appeal pronouncing a dissent which the statute forbids to be
pronounced.""

It follows that, upon the record
in the present case, and having regard to the requirements of sections 1013  and
1024 , an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was not open to the appellant.

The absence of the requisite
direction under subsection 5  of section 1013  was, however, not brought to our
attention and we have heard counsel on the merits of the case. We may therefore
add that, had there been jurisdiction, the result could not, in our view, have
been different from that reached by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia.

The ground of appeal was
misdirection. The learned trial judge, when giving, at the conclusion of his
address to the jury, a short recapitulation of each count in the indictment, by
a slip of the tongue, misdescribed the third count, the substance of which he
had, but a moment before, correctly stated to the jury. The three judges who
concurred in dismissing the appeal were of opinion that, notwithstanding this
misstatement, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had actually
occurred. The two other judges thought differently.

It is at least doubtful whether,
even had a dissent been regularly and legally pronounced, a difference of
opinion on such a question should be considered as a dissent upon a question of
law. It is not necessary, however, to decide that point in this case, since a
careful examina-

[Page 458]

tion of the whole record and a
full consideration of the able argument presented to us does not, in our view,
warrant interference with the judgment of the court below.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Appeal—Leave to appeal to
Supreme Court of Canada— Court of appeal judgment conflicting with judgment of
another court of appeal in like case—Both judgments not necessarily in similar
cases, but upon similar questions of law—Equal division of court of appeal
—Section 1024a Cr. C.

In order to obtain leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada in a criminal case under section 1024a Cr. C, it is not necessary that the judgment
from which it is sought to appeal and that of any other court of appeal should
have been rendered in cases in all respects the same; but there should be a
conflict between the two judgments upon a question of law similar in both
cases.

Quaere whether
a judgment rendered upon an equal division of a court of appeal is a “judgment”
which can be appealed from under section 1024a Cr. C.

MOTION under section 1024a of the Criminal
Code  for leave to appeal to this court from the judgment of the Court of King’s
Bench, appeal side, province of
Quebec, upholding the conviction of the appellant for forgery. Leave to appeal
was refused by the judgment now reported.

Lucien Gendron for
the motion.

Ernest Bertrand K.C. contra.

Rinfret J.—Cette requête demande la permission d’en
appeler à la Cour Suprême du Canada de la décision de la Cour du Banc du Roi de
la province de Québec qui a, par

[Page 285]

un jugement unanime, rejeté le pourvoi en appel
d’une condamnation prononcée par la Cour des Sessions de la Paix, siégeant à
Montréal.

L’accusé a été trouvé coupable de faux. Il a porté
sa cause devant la Cour du Banc du Roi en se basant, entre autres moyens, sur
les griefs de droit qui suivent:—

1° Il n’y avait pas au
dossier la corroboration exigée
par l’article 1002  du Code
Criminel ;

2° Une signature fictive
sur le document incriminé de faux (à savoir: sur une demande de licence pour
automobile) ne constitue pas le crime de faux prévu au Code Criminel .

La Cour du Banc du Roi a rejeté ces deux griefs et
a confirmé la décision du premier tribunal.

L’appelant allègue que cet arrêt est contraire à
deux jugements des cours d’appel de la province d’Ontario et invoque cette
prétendue contradiction à l’appui de sa requête devant cette cour. Il se
réclame de l’article 1024a du Code Criminel .

Cet article, pour autoriser un juge à permettre
l’appel à la Cour Suprême du Canada, ne se préoccupe en aucune façon du bien ou
mal fondé du jugement a quo, mais il exige que l’on démontre que ce jugement entre en conflit avec
l’arrêt d’un autre tribunal d’appel provincial. Il n’est pas nécessaire que ces
arrêts aient été prononcés dans une cause identique (The
King v. Book)[1]; mais il faut au moins qu’une question de
droit analogue, servant de base à chacun des arrêts, ait été tranchée par
chaque cour d’appel dans un sens différent.

Ici, l’appelant interprète le jugement de la Cour
du Banc du Roi comme ayant décidé en principe que le témoignage d’un expert en
écriture constitue la corroboration visée par l’article 1002  du
Code Criminel . Il y voit un conflit avec la, décision de la Cour d’Appel d’Ontario dans l’affaire de The Queen v. McBride[2].

M. le juge Bernier, parlant au nom de la cour dans
la cause actuelle, dit qu’une demande pour licence d’automobile, signée du nom
de Joseph Church, a été présentée
pour enregistrement au bureau de Marieville. Joseph Church
y

[Page 286]

était indiqué comme propriétaire de la voiture et
résidant au n° 997, rue Evelyn, à Verdun.

La licence fut accordée.

La preuve a révélé que le prétendu Joseph Church n’existait pas et que la demande
a donc été signée d’un nom fictif.

Par contre, c’est l’accusé qui demeurait à
l’adresse indiquée et qui était propriétaire de la maison portant cette
adresse.

Le 26 mai
1925, trois demandes pour licence
en vertu de la loi des véhicules-moteurs (respectivement comme chauffeur, comme
commerçant d’automobiles et comme propriétaire de garage), signées du nom de
l’accusé, furent déposées à Marieville. Mademoiselle M. Gareau, qui les a
reçues, a identifié l’accusé comme étant celui qui les a signées. Elle a alors
épinglé elle-même la photographie de Barré sur la licence de chauffeur.

Deux experts jurent que la demande du prétendu
Joseph Church et les trois
demandes reçues par Mademoiselle Gareau sont écrites de la même main.

L’on a aussi établi les circonstances suivantes: au
cours de l’enquête préliminaire, le procureur de l’accusé a soulevé un doute
sur le numéro de l’automobile pour laquelle la licence avait été accordée. Le
procureur de la Couronne donna immédiatement des ordres pour qu’on emmenât la
voiture à Montréal. Or, on avait devancé cette démarche; quelqu’un était allé
changer les chiffres du numéro, à Thetford Mines, où se trouvait la voiture.
Enfin, le document argué de faux portait au verso le nom à moitié effacé d’un
parent de l’appelant, un nommé Arcade Dubois.

C’est dans ces témoignages et dans toutes ces
circonstances que la Cour du Banc du Roi a trouvé la preuve et la corroboration suffisante pour justifier la
conviction et la condamnation de l’accusé en Cour des Sessions de la Paix. M.
le juge Bernier le dit:—

En vertu de l’article 1002 
C. Or., nulle personne ne peut être convaincue sur le
témoignage d’un seul témoin, dans un cas de faux, à moins qu’il ne soit
corroboré sous quelque rapport essentiel. Or, dans la présente cause, il ne
peut y avoir de doute qu’il y a eu corroboration sur l’accusation portée contre l’appelant. J’ai indiqué ces faits de
corroboration; ils sont multiples.

On ne saurait donc, comme le fait l’appelant,
réduire ce jugement à la simple proposition “que le témoignage d’un

[Page 287]

expert en écriture constitue
la corroboration visée par l’article 1002  du Code Criminel ”. Ce n’est pas
sur ce principe que la Cour du Banc du Roi a appuyé son jugement. Elle a trouvé
qu’il y avait des témoins et de “multiples” faits de corroboration.

Ce n’est pas non plus, à notre avis, le principe
contraire qui est affirmé par la cour d’appel d’Ontario re The Queen v. McBride[3].
La preuve dans cette cause consistait dans la déposition
d’un seul témoin à l’effet que l’écriture sur les documents argués de faux et
l’écriture dans un certain livre produit était dans chaque cas celle de
l’accusé. La cour refusa d’y voir la corroboration exigée par le code et s’en expliqua comme suit:—

That the signatures in question and the
names in the book were in the same handwriting in no way implicated the
accused, unless it was shewn that the names in the book were written by the
accused, and the only evidence of that was the evidence of Davis.

It is clear, therefore, that Davis was the
only witness who implicated the accused, and that there was no such
corroboration of his evidence as is required to justify a conviction.

Nous ne voyons ni dans l’un, ni dans l’autre arrêt
la discussion de la question de savoir si “le témoignage d’un expert en écriture constitue la corroboration visée par l’article 1002  du Code Criminel ”.
Il n’a donc pu y avoir conflit de décision sur cette
question. En somme, une cour a jugé dans une espèce qu’il y avait témoignage et
corroboration par des faits “multiples”; l’autre cour, qu’un seul et même témoin déposant uniquement quant à
l’identité de plusieurs écrits et les attribuant à l’accusé ne pouvait
constituer à la fois le témoignage et la corroboration requis par le code.

L’appelant n’est pas plus heureux sur son second
moyen.

Dans la cause re Murphy[4],
où il prétend trouver l’affirmation d’un principe de droit
contraire à celui qui est soutenu dans l’arrêt qui l’a condamné, la cour
d’appel de. l’Ontario, formée en cette circonstance de quatre juges seulement,
s’est divisée également sur la décision à rendre. On peut se demander si un partage
égal d’opinions dans un tribunal d’appel constitue un jugement, et surtout s’il
peut en résulter un arrêt de principe opposé à celui d’un autre tribunal, tel
que requis par l’article 1024a du Code Criminel .

(Voir Beamish v. Beamish (1); lire
Lumsden v. Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Commission (2),
référant à McArthur v. Northern and Pacific Junction Railway Company (3); voir Stuart
v. Bank of Montreal (4). Si Ton répondait dans la négative, il manquerait ici l’élément essentiel pour
donner ouverture à un appel à la Cour Suprême du Canada.

Mais, dans cette cause de Murphy
(5), l’une des questions discutées par l’un des juges
d’appel seulement (lequel par surcroît n’était pas du côté dont l’opinion a
prévalu) avait une analogie éloignée avec celle qui sert de base au deuxième
moyen de l’appelant. Les autres juges, tant dans la “Common
Pleas Division” que dans la “Court of Appeal,” ont exprimé leur avis sur le point
que, sur demande d’extradition pour crime de faux, il suffit de justifier de
faits qui constituent un faux suivant la loi de notre pays, sans qu’il soit
nécessaire d’établir quels sont les éléments constitutifs du crime de faux dans
le pays étranger pour qui l’extradition est poursuivie. Il n’y a aucun rapprochement
possible entre cette question et celle sur laquelle l’appelant fonde le second
moyen de sa requête.

La permission d’appel à cette cour ne peut donc se
justifier en vertu de l’article 1024a du Code Criminel  et elle doit être
refusée.
