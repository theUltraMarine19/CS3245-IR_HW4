2760959,Karim v R; Magaming v R; Bin Lahaiya v R; Bayu v R; Alomalu v R [2013] NSWCCA 23,"Judgment
1BATHURST CJ:  I agree with the orders proposed by Allsop P and with his reasons for dismissing the appeal.  I also agree with the additional remarks made by him in pars [112]-[126] of his Honour's judgment.
2ALLSOP P:  Four applicants, Mursid Karim, Bimbi Yusuf Bin Lahaiya, Bayu Bayu (aka Ilham Dahlan) and Bonang Darius Magaming, seek leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon them for offences committed with the bringing to Australia by seagoing vessel of persons who were not authorised to enter Australia.  A fifth, Sakarias Alomalu, also sought leave to appeal against his sentence, but, alone among the applicants, Mr Alomalu had an appeal against conviction.  That appeal was heard in early October 2012 by a differently constituted Court of Criminal Appeal (constituted by the Chief Judge at Common Law together with Rothman J and Adamson J).  The Court reserved its decision.  During the hearing before this Court of the applications concerning sentence, the Court that heard Mr Alomalu's conviction appeal was in a position to make orders.  The orders made allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and entered a verdict of acquittal.  Mr Alomalu did not, therefore, take any part thereafter in the sentence appeal.  His application for leave to appeal against sentence should be dismissed as otiose.  
3Involved in the sentence appeals is a challenge to the Constitutional validity of provisions of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) that were central to the sentences imposed on each man.  The provisions in question concerned mandatory minimum sentences for the offences in question.  The issues raised were substantial and of public importance.  Leave to appeal should be granted in each case, with the exception of Mr Alomalu's application because his conviction appeal has been upheld.  
The statutory context
4Before turning to the position of each applicant and the central Constitutional argument, the relevant statutory provisions should be explained.  Those provisions are in two numbered forms.  Taking effect on 1 June 2010, the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Act 2010 (Cth) (the ""2010 Act"") repealed and re-enacted in reworked and renumbered form ss 232A to 233C of Pt 2, Div 12, Sub-div A of the Migration Act.  
The provisions before 1 June 2010
5Subdivision A contains provisions which were not repealed by the 2010 Act.  Sections 229 to 232 provide for the offences of carriage of non-citizens to Australia without documentation and the carriage of concealed persons to Australia (stowaways), the provision by the master of a vessel of certain information to an authorised officer and the penalty upon a master, owner, agent or charterer of a vessel where a non-citizen enters Australia without a visa as an unlawful non-citizen.  
6Section 234 concerns false papers; s 235 concerns offences in relation to work; s 236 concerns offences relating to visas.  
7Section 232A (the first of the provisions repealed by the 2010 Act) was in the following terms:232A  Organising bringing groups of noncitizens into Australia
(1) A person who:(a) organises or facilitates the bringing or coming to Australia, or the entry or proposed entry into Australia, of a group of 5 or more people to whom subsection 42(1) applies; and(b) does so reckless as to whether the people had, or have, a lawful right to come to Australia;is guilty of an offence punishable, on conviction, by imprisonment for 20 years or 2,000 penalty units, or both.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to establishing that subsection 42(1) does not apply to a person because of subsection 42(2) or (2A) or regulations made under subsection 42(3).
8Section 233 was in the following terms:233  Persons concerned in bringing noncitizens into Australia in contravention of this Act or harbouring illegal entrants
(1) A person shall not take any part in:(a) the bringing or coming to Australia of a noncitizen under circumstances from which it might reasonably have been inferred that the noncitizen intended to enter Australia in contravention of this Act;(b) the concealing of a noncitizen with intent to enter Australia in contravention of this Act; or(c) the concealing of an unlawful noncitizen or a deportee with intent to prevent discovery by an officer.
(1A) Strict liability applies to the element of an offence against paragraph (1)(a) that the bringing or coming to Australia of the relevant noncitizen was under circumstances from which it might reasonably have been inferred that the noncitizen intended to enter Australia in contravention of this Act.
 (2) A person is guilty of an offence if:  (a) the person harbours another person; and(b) the other person is an unlawful noncitizen, a removee or a deportee.
Penalty:  Imprisonment for 10 years or 1,000 penalty units, or both.
9At this point it is worth noting that:  s 232 A(1) referred to a group of five or more persons, whereas s 233(1) referred to ""a non-citizen"", including, of course, more than one (Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), s 23(b)); the operative expressions in s 232A(1) were ""organise"" or ""facilitate"" and in s 233(1) the expression was ""take any part in""; s 232A(1) required that the person be reckless as to whether the ""people had, or have, a lawful right to come to Australia"", whereas s 233(1) referred to circumstances from which it might reasonably be inferred that the ""non-citizen intended to enter Australia in contravention of [the Migration Act].""  These considerations tended to indicate a higher degree of seriousness of the offence in s 232A than in s 233.  This was reflected starkly in the different punishments provided for:  20 years imprisonment and 10 years imprisonment respectively.  
10Section 233A created offences for specific acts in connection with the entry into Australia or application for visas concerning five or more people, and was in the following terms: 233A  Other offences relating to groups of noncitizens etc.
(1) A person must not, in connection with:(a) the entry or proposed entry into Australia, or the immigration clearance, of a group of 5 or more noncitizens (which may include that person), or of any member of such a group; or(b) an application for a visa or a further visa permitting a group of 5 or more noncitizens (which may include that person), or any member of such a group, to remain in Australia;do any of the following:(c) present, or cause to be presented, to an officer or a person exercising powers or performing functions under this Act a document that the person knows is forged or false;(d) make, or cause to be made, to an officer or a person exercising powers or performing functions under this Act a statement that the person knows is false or misleading in a material particular;(e) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to an officer or a person exercising powers or performing functions under this Act, or otherwise furnish, or cause to be furnished, for official purposes of the Commonwealth, a document containing a statement or information that the person knows is false or misleading in a material particular.
(2) A person must not transfer or part with possession of a document or documents:(a) with the intention that the document or documents be used to help a group of 5 or more people, none of whom are entitled to use the document or documents, or any member of such a group, to gain entry into or remain in Australia, or to be immigration cleared; or(b) if the person has reason to suspect that the document or documents may be so used.Penalty: Imprisonment for 20 years or 2,000 penalty units, or both.
11The offences in s 233A(1) required knowledge of the relevant falsity, and the offence in s 233A(2)(a) required intention; the offence in s 233A(2)(b) only required, however, reason to suspect the false use of a document.  
12Sections 233B and 233C concerned penalty for both ss 232A and 233A, but not for s 233.  Section 233B provided that, except for a person charged with an offence under ss 232A and 233A who was proved to be under 18 years of age, a court was not permitted to make an order under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 19B permitting discharge of a person without proceeding to a conviction or the dismissal of the charge where the charge is proved.  Section 233C, which was at the heart of the debate before this Court, provided for mandatory minimum head sentences and non-parole periods for the offences in ss 232A and 233A (but not in s 233) in the following terms:233C  Mandatory penalties for certain offences
(1) This section applies if a person is convicted of an offence under section 232A or 233A, unless it is established on the balance of probabilities that the person was aged under 18 years when the offence was committed.
(2) The court must impose a sentence of imprisonment of at least: (a) 8 years, if the conviction is for a repeat offence; or (b) 5 years, in any other case.
(3) The court must also set a nonparole period of at least: (a) 5 years, if the conviction is for a repeat offence; or (b) 3 years, in any other case.
(4) In this section:(a) nonparole period has the same meaning as it has in Part IB of the Crimes Act 1914; and(b) a person's conviction for an offence is for a repeat offence if, on a previous occasion after the commencement of this section, a court:(i) has convicted the person of another offence, being an offence against section 232A or 233A; or(ii)  has found, without recording a conviction, that the person had committed another such offence.
13I will henceforth refer to the provisions which were repealed by the 2010 Act as the 'old' sections and their replacement sections as the 'new' sections.  
The provisions after 1 June 2010
14In place of old ss 232A to 233C set out above there were enacted new ss 233A to 233E.  New s 233A created the offence of ""people smuggling"".  It is in the following terms:233A  Offence of people smuggling
(1) A person (the first person) commits an offence if:(a) the first person organises or facilitates the bringing or coming to Australia, or the entry or proposed entry into Australia, of another person (the second person); and (b) the second person is a noncitizen; and(c) the second person had, or has, no lawful right to come to Australia.
Penalty:  Imprisonment for 10 years or 1,000 penalty units, or both.
(2) Absolute liability applies to paragraph (1)(b).
(3) For the purposes of this Act, an offence against subsection (1) is to be known as the offence of people smuggling.
15The element of the offence is ""organise or facilitate""; the provision is in respect of one (or more than one) person:  Acts Interpretation Act, s 23(b); the offence no longer has an element of ""circumstances from which it might reasonably have been inferred"" as did the old s 233 or ""recklessness"" as did the old s 232A.  
16New s 233B provides for an offence of aggravated people smuggling.  It is in the following terms:233B  Aggravated offence of people smuggling (exploitation, or danger of death or serious harm etc.)
(1) A person (the first person) commits an offence against this section if the first person commits the offence of people smuggling (the underlying offence) in relation to another person (the victim) and any of the following applies:(a) the first person commits the underlying offence intending that the victim will be exploited after entry into Australia (whether by the first person or another);(b) in committing the underlying offence, the first person subjects the victim to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment (within the ordinary meaning of that expression); (c) in committing the underlying offence:(i) the first person's conduct gives rise to a danger of death or serious harm to the victim; and(ii) the first person is reckless as to the danger of death or serious harm to the victim that arises from the conduct.
Penalty: Imprisonment for 20 years or 2,000 penalty units, or both.(2) There is no fault element for the physical element of conduct described in subsection (1), that the first person commits the underlying offence, other than the fault elements (however described), if any, for the underlying offence.
(3) To avoid doubt, the first person may be convicted of an offence against this section even if the first person has not been convicted of the underlying offence.
(4) In this section:
exploit has the same meaning as in the Criminal Code.
forced labour has the same meaning as in section 73.2 of the Criminal Code.
serious harm has the same meaning as in the Criminal Code.
sexual servitude has the meaning given by section 270.4 of the Criminal Code.
slavery has the meaning given by section 270.1 of the Criminal Code.
17The aggravation in respect of the underlying offence arises from the character and surrounding circumstances of the organising or facilitating:  see paras (a), (b) and (c).  
18New s 233C also provides for an offence of aggravated people smuggling.  The aggravation in respect of the underlying offence is the number of people involved.  Of course, even if five people are involved, the new s 233A could be used.  This overlap was at the heart of the argument as to Constitutional validity.  Section 233C is in the following terms:233C  Aggravated offence of people smuggling (at least 5 people)
(1) A person (the first person) commits an offence if:(a) the first person organises or facilitates the bringing or coming to Australia, or the entry or proposed entry into Australia, of a group of at least 5 persons (the other persons); and (b) at least 5 of the other persons are noncitizens; and(c) the persons referred to in paragraph (b) who are noncitizens had, or have, no lawful right to come to Australia.
Penalty:  Imprisonment for 20 years or 2,000 penalty units, or both.
(2) Absolute liability applies to paragraph (1)(b).
(3) If, on a trial for an offence against subsection (1), the trier of fact:(a) is not satisfied that the defendant is guilty of that offence; and(b) is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the offence of people smuggling;the trier of fact may find the defendant not guilty of an offence against subsection (1) but guilty of the offence of people smuggling, so long as the defendant has been accorded procedural fairness in relation to that finding of guilt.
19Sections 233D and 233E concern supporting the offence of people smuggling and concealing and harbouring non-citizens and other matters.
20It is to be noted that the rewording of the new ss 233A, 233B and 233C did away with the differences in wording of the elements of the offences in the old ss 232A, 233 and 233A.  The new provisions built on the common formulation of the primary offence of people smuggling in s 233A.  
21Section 234A concerns an aggravated offence of false documents and false and misleading information relating to at least five non-citizens, the number of non-citizens involved being the only aggravating element to the offence in s 234.  Neither provision played any direct part in the appeal.  No applicant was charged under either section, but the arguments on appeal would apply to these provisions as well.  The penalties for the two offences in ss 234 and 234A are 10 years and 1,000 penalty units, and 20 years imprisonment and 2,000 penalty units, respectively.  
22New ss 236A and 236B concern the aggravated offences in ss 233B, 233C and 234A, but not the offence of people smuggling in s 233A or the false documents offence in s 234.  Section 236A provides for the operation of the Crimes Act, s 19B as did the old s 233B.  New s 236B provides for mandatory minimum sentences in the manner of the old s 233C.  New s 236B is in the following terms:236B  Mandatory minimum penalties for certain offences
(1) This section applies if a person is convicted of an offence against section 233B, 233C or 234A.
(2) This section does not apply if it is established on the balance of probabilities that the person was aged under 18 years when the offence was committed. (3) The court must impose a sentence of imprisonment of at least:(a) if the conviction is for an offence against section 233B-8 years; or (b) if the conviction is for a repeat offence-8 years; or (c) in any other case-5 years.
(4) The court must also set a nonparole period of at least:(a) if the conviction is for an offence to which paragraph (3)(a) or (b) applies-5 years; or (b) in any other case-3 years.
(5) A person's conviction for an offence is for a repeat offence if:(a) in proceedings after the commencement of this section (whether in the same proceedings as the proceedings relating to the offence, or in previous proceedings), a court:(i) has convicted the person of another offence, being an offence against section 233B, 233C or 234A of this Act; or(ii) has found, without recording a conviction, that the person has committed another such offence; or
(b) in proceedings after the commencement of the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Act 2001 (whether in the same proceedings as the proceedings relating to the offence, or in previous proceedings), a court:(i) has convicted the person of another offence, being an offence against section 232A or 233A of this Act as in force before the commencement of this section; or(ii) has found, without recording a conviction, that the person has committed another such offence.
 (6) In this section:nonparole period has the same meaning as it has in Part IB of the Crimes Act 1914.
Some further comments on the history of the statutory provisions
23Commonwealth offences relating to unauthorised entry into Australia have existed since Federation: see for example the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 (Cth), s 9 that provided for a summary offence by a master, owner, agent or charterer of a vessel from which any prohibited immigrant entered the Commonwealth, with a penalty of 100 pounds per prohibited immigrant: cf the Migration Act, s 232, above.  From 1910, the Immigration Restriction Act (later renamed the Immigration Act), s 12A created the offence of being directly or indirectly concerned in the bringing into, or concealment of persons in the Commonwealth in circumstances leading to the inference that the immigrant intended to land secretly or without the knowledge of the officer.  Section 12A prescribed a penalty of 100 pounds or six months' imprisonment, or both.  This became s 30 of the Migration Act 1958 - 1973 (Cth).  Over time this penalty increased.  By 1973, the penalty was four hundred dollars or imprisonment for six months (Migration Act 1958 - 1973, s 30). On 22 July 1999, with the section numbers having changed from s 12A of the Immigration Restriction Act and the Immigration Act, to ss 30 to 80 to 233 of the Migration Act, the penalty increased to 10 years or 1,000 penalty units, or both (Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No.1) 1999, Schedule 1(6)).  This increase was recognised to be because of the seriousness of the offence and the clear need for deterrence.  
24On the same day as the penalty for s 233 was increased, the same legislation created the offences in the old ss 232A and 233A, relating to organising the entry into Australia of groups of non-citizens and to false documents and misleading information in connection with the entry of groups of non-citizens, respectively.  The maximum penalty for each of these offences was imprisonment for 20 years, 2,000 penalty units or both.  
25The clear policy of Parliament was to increase penalties and express a view as to the seriousness of the offending.  A sentencing court was obliged, however, in the exercise of judicial power, to impose a sentence that was of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence:  the Crimes Act, s 16A(1), taking into account, in addition to any other matter, the considerations in s 16A(2) and generally in accordance with the Crimes Act, Part 1B.  
26In September 2001, a suite of six Commonwealth Acts came into force which affected the entry into and remaining in Australia by aliens:  Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Act 2001 (Cth) (the ""Border Protection Act""), Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Act 2001 (Cth), Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2001 (Cth), Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No 1) 2001 (Cth), Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No 5) 2001 (Cth) and Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No 6) 2001 (Cth).   The context of the passing into force of these Acts was described by the High Court in Plaintiff M61/2010E v The Commonwealth [2010] HCA 41; 243 CLR 319 at [29] - [30], 339 - 340.  
27The Border Protection Act introduced old s 233C into the Migration Act, providing for mandatory minimum penalties for persons convicted of offences under old ss 232A and 233A.  The expression of the purpose of s 233C was to ""limit ... sentencing options for people smuggling offences"":  Explanatory Memorandum, and to ""send ... a very important red light to would-be people smugglers"":  second reading speech of the Minister, the Hon Philip Ruddock, Hansard, House of Representatives, 18 September 2001, p 30870.  
28On 16 January 2003, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (People Smuggling, Firearms Trafficking and Other Measures) Act 2002 (Cth) introduced cognate offences into Div 73 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).  These offences were people smuggling, aggravated people smuggling by exploitation, aggravated people smuggling of five people or more and offences concerning travel and identity documents. These were offences were similar in kind and character to those contained in the Migration Act, except that they related to the entry into a foreign country, whether or not via Australia. The penalties reflected the regime in the Migration Act at that time:  imprisonment for 10 years or 1,000 penalty units or both for people smuggling and the travel and identity document offences, and imprisonment for 20 years or 2,000 penalty units or both for the aggravated people smuggling offences.  The penalties for these offences have never been subject to mandatory minimum sentences. 
29In 2010, the amendments that I have earlier outlined were made.  The purpose of the amending legislation (the 2010 Act) was said by the Attorney-General (the Hon Robert McClelland) to strengthen the Commonwealth's anti-people smuggling legislative framework.  The Attorney-General also referred to the serious criminal conduct of smuggling and subsequently endangering people.  In connection with the extension of mandatory minimum sentences to the new aggravated people smuggling offence involving exploitation or danger of death or serious harm, the Attorney-General said:
""The use of mandatory minimum penalties reflects the seriousness of the activity being prosecuted.  It allows the court to determine an appropriate penalty within the minimum and maximum set by Parliament."" (Second reading speech of the Minister, the Hon Robert McClelland, Hansard, House of Representatives, 24 February 2010, p 1645.)
30It is appropriate at this point, by way of preface to the balance of this judgment, to recognise the seriousness of the conduct to which these sections are directed.    In R v Feng Lin [2001] NSWCCA 7; 119 A Crim R 194 Mason P at [3] and Carruthers AJ at [49] - [50] (with whose reasons Hidden J agreed) explained the seriousness of the offences and the need for deterrence: 
Mason P:""3    The objective seriousness of the offence is evident from its nature and the reasons underlying the 1999 amendments which increased the maximum penalty to ten years imprisonment or 1000 penalty units or both.  Smuggling non-citizens into Australia presents obvious social problems to the fabric of Australian society; it undermines the attempted equities of an organised immigration and refugee system; it exposes the participants to exploitation and risk to health and life; and it imposes significant costs upon the Australian public.  The need for deterrent penalties is manifest given the difficulties of detection and the exposure of Australia through its vast coastline.  The extent of the problem has increased markedly in recent years, according to the Minister's second reading speech set out in the judgment of Carruthers AJ.
...
Carruthers AJ:49    When introducing the Bill into the House of Representatives, the Honourable Peter Slipper (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) said (Hansard 30 June 1999 p 7992): - 
""The government is committed to protecting the integrity of the nation's borders and to stopping the work of people traffickers who think nothing of exploiting people with the false promise of entry into Australia.""
50    The Honourable Con Sciacca, (Shadow Minister for Immigration) who supported the Bill, said during the course of the debate (at p 7993): -
""Over the past 18 months Australia has increasingly been seen as a soft target to gangs of people traffickers in a number of countries. Overall in 1997-98 some 157 illegal immigrants arrived by sea on our shores.  In 1998-99 this figure increased eightfold to 859, and more are coming every day.  This increase in people smuggling in the operation of the so-called 'snakeheads', signifies that Australia's penalties for these offences do not go far enough to deter those who assist these criminal warlords on our shores.  The amendments put forward today reflect the seriousness of these crimes and their cost to the government and to the Australian community.""""
31In light of some of the later discussion in these reasons about the character and potential effect of mandatory minimum sentences, it is appropriate to say that the smuggling of people illicitly into Australia (whatever may well be the justness of claims of such people for protection by Australia) is potentially productive of great suffering.  The people smuggled are at risk of great danger on both land and sea journeys; they, by necessity, associate with organised criminal gangs, sometimes at great financial cost, which, it might be thought, can only often be afforded by many people by ancillary participation in darker forms of human trafficking.  The deterrence of the illicit trade in smuggling people can be seen as both a legitimate and important public policy of the Australian Parliament.
The charges and sentences of the applicants
32Two applicants, Mr Bayu and Mr Karim, were charged under the old s 232A, their offences having been committed in February and April 2010, respectively.  Mr Bayu pleaded guilty.  Mr Karim pleaded not guilty, but was found guilty.  Both were sentenced under the old s 233C.  Mr Bayu was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of three and a half years.  Mr Karim was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of three years. 
33The other three applicants, Mr Magaming, Mr Alomalu and Mr Bin Lahaiya were charged under the new s 233C, their offences having been committed in September and October 2010.  Mr Magaming pleaded guilty.  The other two pleaded not guilty, but were found guilty.  All three were sentenced under the new s 236B.  All were sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 3 years.  
The Constitutional challenge to old s 233C and new s 236B
34The principal submissions on Constitutional invalidity were put on behalf of Mr Karim.  They were adopted by Messrs Bayu, Magaming and Bin Lahaiya.  The arguments put were referable to both the old and new provisions.  Subject to one argument of the Crown referable only to the old provisions, and so the positions of Mr Bayu and Mr Karim, the arguments put on behalf of Mr Karim were applicable to both old s 233C and new s 236B.  
35The Australian Human Rights Commission (the ""Commission"") sought leave to intervene in Mr Karim's application in support of the Constitutional arguments put by him on four issues that were raised by his grounds of appeal and expressed by the Commission in its submissions as follows:
""(a)  the relevance of the common law to concepts of judicial power and the judicial process contemplated by Chapter III of the Constitution;
(b)  the influence of international human rights on the development of the common law; 
(c) the content of international human rights as they relate to mandatory minimum sentencing regimes; and 
(d)  the relevance of international human rights, as they relate to mandatory minimum sentencing regimes, to the concepts of judicial power and judicial process.""  
36The Crown opposed the grant of leave.  It first denied that the Court had ""jurisdiction"" to grant leave.  That submission was withdrawn at the hearing.  The Court of Criminal Appeal certainly has authority implied within the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in the furtherance of the expeditious and just resolution of disputes before it, to grant leave to a non-party to put submissions in an appropriate case as amicus.  The grant can be so limited as to avoid strict party status.  Whether or not the Court has authority to permit full intervention in a criminal matter (and if it does, the circumstances in which it should be granted) need not be decided.  There is no call therefore to deal with R v GJ [2005] NTCCA 20; 196 FLR 233. 
37The Court received detailed written submissions from Ms Perry QC and Ms Younan, as well as oral submissions in reply to the Crown's written submissions that had addressed the Commission's written submissions. 
38As the argument developed, in particular, as Mr Karim's counsel, Mr Williams SC and Mr King, refined and limited their arguments, the submissions of the Commission threw a valuable and fundamental perspective on the debate.  Whilst the Constitutional challenge must fail, at this level of an intermediate court of appeal, the submissions of the Commission were valuable and of great assistance, in addition to the helpful and clear submissions put on behalf of Mr Karim.  
39Exercising the necessary due caution in permitting third parties to assist as amicus:  Levy v Victoria  [1997] HCA 31; 189 CLR 579, I would grant leave to the Commission to put submissions as amicus curiae.  The Commission's submissions developed aspects of the Constitutional and international framework not developed by Mr Karim. 
A relevant question of statutory interpretation
40Before turning to the three central submissions of Mr Karim, it is appropriate to deal with a question of statutory interpretation that is common to both old s 233C and new s 236B.  Whilst the question was not central to Mr Karim's submissions that were expounded at the appeal, it bears some relationship to them, and, further, it was an important question in the submissions put on behalf of Mr Bayu concerning his sentence. 
41In R v Pot, Wetangky and Lande (unrep., NT Supreme Court, Riley CJ, 18 January 2011), the offenders had pleaded guilty to offences under old s 232A.  The Chief Justice approached the sentencing task conformably with the approach taken by judges in the Northern Territory Supreme Court to that date:  Mildren J in Tahir and Beny (28 October 2009) and Kelly J in Dokeng (2 December 2010).  That approach was to apply Pt 1B of the Crimes Act to come to a view about an appropriate sentence in all the circumstances of the offence.  If the sentence considered thus was less than the mandatory minimum non-parole period and head sentence, it would be raised to meet the mandatory requirements of s 233C.  Riley CJ said in his reasons:
""There is no suggestion that by creating the mandatory minimum penalty provided for in s 233C of the Migration Act the legislature intended to undermine those general sentencing principles found in Part 1B of the Crimes Act or the relevant common law principles.  There is nothing to suggest that it was intended that the requirements of s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act should be read to require a Court to determine the appropriate severity of a sentence by reference to a predetermined base not necessarily reflecting the circumstances of the offending and which may be removed from what the Court would otherwise consider an appropriate sentence in all the circumstances.  
The minimum sentence previously applicable was not abrogated by the inclusion of s 233C of the Act.  The section simply required a sentence of at least the mandatory minimum to be applied in identified circumstances.  The explanatory memorandum expressed the position in these terms:
""Mandatory minimum penalties still provide a court with discretion when determining the appropriate sentence providing that the Court does not go below the mandatory minimum sentence and non-parole period.  This allows the Court to have regard to the circumstances of both the offence and the offender.""  
The Court continues to be obliged to have regard to the same general sentencing principles as was previously the case, including determining a sentence of severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. 
In my opinion, the section provides the minimum sentence that can be imposed in the identified circumstances but does not go so far as to reserve that mandatory minimum sentence only for cases at the lowest end of seriousness for relevant offending, as submitted by the Crown.  A clear expression of such an intention would be expected and is not present."" 
42The Western Australian Court of Appeal disagreed with this approach in Bahar v R [2011] WASCA 249; 255 FLR 80.  The reasons of the Court were those of McLure P, with which Martin CJ and Mazza J agreed.  McLure P recognised that s 233C is to be construed together with Pt 1B, and in particular s 16A, of the Crimes Act.  Her Honour said that the principle of proportionality central to s 16A incorporates the objective circumstances of the seriousness of the offence:  Hoare v The Queen [1989] HCA 33; 167 CLR 348 at 354; and s 16A(2)(a):  see [44] - [45] of McLure P's reasons and the seriousness of the offence ""is to be determined by taking into account both the statutory maximum penalty as well as any statutory minimum penalty"":  [45] of McLure P's reasons.  The language of the provisions made it clear that, as her Honour said, Parliament intended to deprive a judicial officer sentencing an offender under s 232A of the power to impose a non-custodial sentence or less than 5 years' imprisonment:  [53] of McLure P's reasons.  Her Honour concluded at [54] that the general sentencing principles in Pt 1B applied, but between the maximum and the mandatory minimum sentences, as the ceiling and the floor of punishing, saying:
""Otherwise, there is no positive inconsistency in terms between s 233C and the general sentencing principles in the Crimes Act as supplemented by common law principles.  In particular, the sentencing principles are intentionally framed at a level of generality for application within the boundaries of power established not only by the maximum statutory penalty but also the minimum statutory penalty.  The statutory maximum and minimum also dictate the seriousness of the offence for the purpose of s 16A(1).  It would be positively inconsistent with the statutory scheme for a sentencing judge to make his or her own assessment as to the 'just and appropriate' sentence ignoring the mandatory minimum or mandatory maximum penalty and then to impose something other than a 'just and appropriate' sentence (whether as to type or length) in order to bring it up to the statutory minimum or down to the statutory maximum, as the case may be.  The statutory minimum and statutory maximum penalties are the floor and ceiling respectively within which the sentencing judge has a sentencing discretion to which the general sentencing principles are to be applied.""    
43The Queensland Court of Appeal has followed Bahar on three occasions:  R v Karabi [2012] QCA 47, R v Nitu [2012] QCA 224 and R v Latif [2012] QCA 278.  
44It was argued by Mr Stratton SC and Ms Manuell SC on behalf of Mr Bayu that Bahar was plainly wrong, justifying departure from it by this Court.  In my view, no argument was put that undermined or threw into sufficient doubt the reasoning of McLure P on what is, essentially, a question of statutory construction.  For an Australian intermediate court of appeal to depart from the decision of another Australian intermediate court of appeal, the nature and quality of the asserted error in the earlier Court's decision must be one which leaves the later court convinced that the earlier decision is wrong (not as a question of patency or obviousness, but as a question of conviction):  see generally Gett v Tabet  [2009] NSWCA 76; 254 ALR 504 at 561 - 566 [274] - [295].  The most, in my view, that can be said here is that the view of Riley CJ (and Mildren J and Kelly J) is one that is open and, with respect, arguable.  Nevertheless, its arguability does not convince me of any error in the approach taken in four intermediate Court of Appeal decisions in two States of the Commonwealth on a matter of statutory interpretation:  Telstra Corporation Ltd v Treloar [2000] FCA 1170; 102 FCR 595 at 602 - 603 at [27] - [28], read with Gett v Tabet at 563 [283].  
45There is an independent reason that leads me to favour the construction in Bahar.  Equal justice inheres in judicial power, the fabric of the law and the basal notion of justice that underpins, informs and binds the legal system.  As Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 608 [65], ""[e]qual justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical.  It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect"" (emphasis in original).  To approach the matter as in Pot would see cases of perceived different seriousness by force of statute given the same penalty.  Thus, if a judge thought the relevant offending in one case to be of low seriousness and worthy of a sentence of six months, but in another case to be of significant seriousness worthy of imprisonment for five years, she or he would be obliged to revise the first sentence to five, leaving the second sentence at that point also.  The statute, and through it the order of the Court, would be the instrument of unequal justice and, so, injustice:  R v Green [2010] NSWCCA 313; 207 A Crim R 148 at 156 [23]; and Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 466 [4] and 489 [80].  On the other hand, approaching the matter as in Bahar permits all usual sentencing considerations, including parity, to be accommodated, though in a more compressed range, and with the consequence of a general increase in the levels of sentences.  
Mr Karim's arguments
46Though specifically limited to old s 233C, the arguments applied equally (and indeed on one view with more force) to new s 236B.  The structure of the argument contained three elements, all closely related.  First, s 233C purports to confer non-judicial power on State courts, because the power in s 233C cannot be exercised in accordance with fundamental principles of equal justice and cannot be exercised other than arbitrarily or capriciously, or without giving reasons.  This can be seen as an attempt to confer non-judicial power, because the legislative power of the Commonwealth Parliament does not extend to requiring courts to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth in a manner contrary to the judicial process. 
47Secondly, s 233C purports to confer judicial power on the Executive.  In written submissions, this second element was expressed in the alternative as a usurpation of the judicial power of the Commonwealth by the legislature.  This latter way of putting the point focused, as did the first element above, to a degree, upon the intrinsic characteristic of a mandatory minimum sentence:  that of the statutory compulsion for the imposition of a sentence at a particular level.  It will be necessary to return to this way of putting the matter (although not pressed by Mr Karim) when dealing with the Commission's submissions.  The way this second element was put in argument on appeal by Mr Karim focused on the place and function of the Executive, in the laying and prosecution of the charge, and the overlapping nature and terms of the offences in old s 233 and s 232A.  In circumstances where there were more than five people involved, the Executive, through the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney-General if a power of direction was used, was given a choice as to which provision the person should be charged under.  This, illegitimately, it was submitted, conferred an aspect of judicial power (the choice of sentence) upon the Executive.  
48Thirdly, s 233C is inconsistent with Chapter III of the Constitution in that it impermissibly directs State courts as to the manner and outcome of the exercise of their jurisdiction to sentence federal offenders, thereby impairing the character of those courts as independent and impartial tribunals.  The written submissions focused upon s 233C being a legislative direction to the court by reason of the mandatory character of the sentence to be imposed.  In oral submissions, this way of putting the matter was not abandoned, but was drawn together with the theme of the argument put on appeal as to the Executive choice involved.  
49It is to be recognised at the outset that the constituent ideas embodied in the three elements are closely related.  This contributes, it might be thought, to their coherency, although also to their vulnerability to existing authority binding on this Court.  
The first element - equal justice and the asserted lack of conformity with the judicial process
50Central to the first element is the overlap between old ss 232A and 233, and between new ss 233A and 233C.  The submissions assumed a significant overlap between the offences.  That was challenged by the Crown in respect of old ss 232A and 233.  I have earlier pointed to some of the differences in wording of the elements of the two offences.  After the textual reworking in 2010, new ss 233A and 233C were relevantly identical.  Either provision could be used to found an indictment for the smuggling of five or more people.  Differences in wording between old ss 232A and 233 were seen by this Court in Feng Lin at [8], [45] - [47] to be of significance.  That view might be seen to undermine what is the fulcrum of much of Mr Karim's arguments - the overlapping nature of these offence provisions.  For the purposes of the analysis of the Constitutional question, I will assume a sufficiently significant overlap in the old provisions to the extent that either provision could be used to found an indictment for the involvement in the entry of five or more people into Australia.  
51It is the overlapping of the offence provisions, with mandatory minimum sentences applying to only one of the offences, that was said to violate the principle of equal justice.  
52The limitation of the argument to the consequences of the overlapping of the offences meant that much of the engagement in the written submissions concerning whether mandatory minimum sentences of themselves offended the equal justice principle fell away, at least in dealing with Mr Karim's submissions.  It will be necessary to return to this question in dealing with the Commission's submissions.
53The principles of equal justice have been expressed in a number of decisions in the High Court, and other courts in this country.  It is a foundational norm inhering in the fabric of the law and in the exercise of judicial power:  Lowe v The Queen  [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606, 610 - 611, 613 and 623 - 624; Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 301 - 302; R v Green [2010] NSWCCA 315; 207 A Crim R 148 at [3]; and Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 472 - 473 [28] where French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said: 
'""Equal justice"" embodies the norm expressed in the term ""equality before the law"".  It is an aspect of the rule of law.  It was characterised by Kelsen as ""the principle of legality, of lawfulness, which is immanent in every legal order"".  It has been called ""the starting point of all other liberties"".  It applies to the interpretation of statutes and thereby to the exercise of statutory powers.  It requires, so far as the law permits, that like cases be treated alike.  Equal justice according to law also requires, where the law permits, differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law.  As Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Wong v The Queen: 
""Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical.  It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect.""'(citations omitted)
54An essential attribute of the exercise of judicial power is that the power is exercised or wielded in accordance with the judicial process, which includes equality before the law, impartiality, procedural fairness, the facts being determined in accordance with rules and procedures which truly permit them to be ascertained:  Nicholas v The Queen [1998] HCA 9; 193 CLR 173 at 208 - 209; Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1999] HCA 9; 198 CLR 334 at 359 [56] and other cases cited at footnotes 110 and 111; and see R v Carroll [2010] NSWCCA 55; 77 NSWLR 45 at 53 - 54 [33] (agreed in 47[1], and 61 [71], [72]).  
55The Commonwealth Parliament has no authority to require or authorise a court to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth in a manner inconsistent with the essential character of a court or inconsistently with the nature of judicial power:  Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, Local Government & Ethnic Affairs  [1992] HCA 64; 176 CLR 1 at 27; Polyukhovich v Commonwealth  [1991] HCA 32; 172 CLR 501 at 607 and 703 - 704.  
56Applying the aforementioned principles to the facts of this case, it was submitted that the invalidity of old s 233C (and the new s 236B) arose from the fact that a person charged under the offence provision that attracts the mandatory minimum sentence provisions will be given a penalty reflecting a fixed view of the severity of the conduct coming from the legislative direction.  The inequality, offending the principle of equal justice, lies in the existence of the other offence for essentially the same conduct (should there be five people smuggled).  Two provisions of the same polity's legislation have criminalised the same conduct with significantly different penalties.  The possible vice in the freedom of executive choice of charge will be dealt with shortly under the second element.  For the first element, the vice is the existence of the two provisions providing for significantly different sentencing results, one being directed by Parliament.  
57The existence of the two provisions dealing with substantially identical conduct and having significantly different sentence provisions means that it is more difficult to defeat the above argument by simply pointing to Parliament's authority to create binding societal norms of conduct by the creation of criminal offences and setting penalties therefor.  No clear norm is promulgated:  one provision has a 10 year maximum, the ascertainment of the sentence being determined by reference to Part 1B of the Crimes Act, and the other has a 20 year maximum with mandatory minimum head sentences and non-parole periods prescribed.  The same conduct (if five or more people are involved) is viewed divergently by the Parliament.  No single norm has been chosen by Parliament.  
58There are at least three difficulties in the path of the above argument on the first element.  First, it requires the recognition of a limit on the Commonwealth Parliament's legislative power such that it cannot pass legislation providing for different offences constituted by the same or substantially identical conduct with materially different sentence provisions.  Such a restriction, said to be sourced in equal justice, goes beyond what can be seen as currently accepted as the limitations flowing from the text and structure of Chapter III, the nature and character of courts and of judicial power. It may be that for the Parliament to create such overlapping offences with different sentencing provisions requires some material upon which Parliament might reasonably form the view that, notwithstanding the substantial similarity of offending, the potential variations in the sentencing of offenders for similar offences is justified:  cf the power conferred by the Constitution in s 51 (xxvi) and Kartinyeri v Commonwealth  [1998] HCA 52; 195 CLR 337 at 365 - 366 [40] - [42].  Regard may also be had, at this point, to what was said by Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ in Cameron v The Queen  [2002] HCA 6; 209 CLR 339 at 344 [15], see [60] below.  
59The recognition and development, if it be appropriate, of such a constraint is a matter of fundamental Constitutional significance and is for the High Court and not an intermediate appellate court:  cf Tabet v Gett [2010] HCA 12; 265 ALR 227 at 234 [25]; Kable v State of New South Wales [2012] NSWCA 243; 293 ALR 719 at [63].  
60Secondly, subject to specific restrictions and implications arising from the federal structure, no implication has yet been drawn from the Constitution that it contains an implied guarantee of equal protection:  Leeth v Commonwealth [1992] HCA 29; 174 CLR 455 at 467.  Leeth was a case dealing with the variable operation through State law (as surrogate federal law, directly picked up by the impugned provision in question) of different non-parole periods for the same offence.  Of relevance to consider here, however, is the rejection by the majority of the approach of Deane and Toohey JJ in their recognition of an implication from the Constitution of the general doctrine of legal equality under the law and before the Courts such as to invalidate a law which provided for differential sentencing results in different States and Territories depending on State law.  On the other hand, in this respect, support for the argument can be drawn from what was said by Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ in Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6; 209 CLR 339 at 344 [15] about the need for any discrimination or inequality in sentencing to be the product of a distinction which is appropriate and adapted to the attainment of a proper objective.  Support can also be found in what Lord Diplock said (speaking for the Privy Council) in Ong Ah Chuan v Public Prosecutor [1981] AC 648 at 673 - 674 about Art 12(1) of the Singapore Constitution providing for equal protection of the law.  His Lordship said that mandatory sentences for certain classes of offences did not infringe Art 12 provided that the factor which the legislature adopted as constituting the dissimilarity or point of departure was not purely arbitrary, but bore a reasonable relation to the social object of the law.  
61The implication of the constraint on Parliament's authority would have to transcend notions of equality before the law, and reach to invalidate any attempt by Parliament to leave to the due exercise of prosecutional choice, the seriousness of the relevant charge to bring, if there be a choice involved. 
62Thirdly, the argument required the putting to one side of the decision of the High Court in Fraser Henleins Pty Ltd v Cody  [1945] HCA 49; 70 CLR 100.  It was accepted by Mr Williams SC that Fraser Henleins is determinative against the second element of the argument.  He submitted, however, that because the cases on equal justice inherent in the exercise of Chapter III power post-date 1945, its implicit effect can be ignored in relation to the first element.  It is necessary, therefore, to examine at this point in the argument (dealing with the first element) what was decided in Fraser Henleins.  
63Before doing so, a fundamental issue of precedent should be recalled.  It was expressed pungently by Brennan CJ (sitting alone) in a summons matter in Ravenor Overseas Inc v Readhead [1998] HCA 17; (1998) 72 ALJR 671 at 672 as follows:
""Nothing is more important to the due administration of justice than that the Courts of Australia should faithfully follow decisions of this Court.  This Court has the responsibility of determining the law applicable throughout the Commonwealth.  Nor should it be thought that, because some new argument can be devised contrary to a holding of this Court, the authority of its decisions become problematic.  Although the decisions of this Court will, when this Court deems it necessary, be revisited, there should be no qualification about the duty of other Courts faithfully to apply the decisions of this Court as they stand.  Although in recent times rapidly changing social conditions and new insights into the Constitution have led to some notable instances where this Court has revisited earlier decisions, it would be erroneous to assume that the corpus of jurisprudence laid down by this Court over nearly a century does not have complete authority.  The decisions of this Court determine the law to be applied by courts throughout the Commonwealth.""64Fraser Henleins, and the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Ex parte Coorey (1944) 45 SR (NSW) 287 that was relevantly approved in Fraser Henleins, concerned the validity of provisions of the Black Marketing Act 1942 (Cth).  Under the National Security Act 1939 (Cth), it was an offence to breach the National Security Regulations made thereunder.  Under the National Security Act, the offence involved in such breach, if prosecuted summarily, carried penalties of a fine not exceeding 100 pounds or imprisonment for six months or both.  If prosecuted upon indictment, the penalties were a fine of any amount or imprisonment for any term, or both.  The Black Marketing Act, s 3 defined ""black marketing"" by reference to certain acts or omissions which were breaches of the National Security Regulations.  Section 4 of the Black Marketing Act provided for sentence upon conviction of the black marketing offences (which were also, of course, offences under the National Security Act).  The penalties under the Black Marketing Act provided for mandatory minimum sentences:  three months' imprisonment upon summary prosecution and 12 months' imprisonment upon indictment; and fines at 1,000 pounds and 10,000 pounds for a company depending upon whether the prosecution was summary or upon indictment. 
65Thus, there were two offences, each defined identically by reference to breaches of the regulations, but with different sentencing regimes, one containing a mandatory minimum sentence.  This legislative structure was the same as that here, subject to the argument of the Crown based on the different wording of the old ss 232A and 233.  
66Section 4 of the Black Marketing Act also provided that the black marketing offence was not to be prosecuted without the written consent of the Attorney-General after a report from the Minister administering the National Security Regulations and advice from a committee appointed by the Attorney-General and the Minister.  
67I will first deal with the Ex parte Coorey.  Various points were ventilated, not all of which are presently relevant.  The point of present relevance that was run by counsel for Mr Coorey (the convicted black marketeer) had been alluded to by Jordan CJ in an earlier and similar case (Ex parte Gerard & Co Pty Ltd; Re Craig (1944) 44 SR (NSW) 370).  In that case, the Chief Justice said the following at 374: 
""A serious question may, however, arise whether the particular form in which it has been sought to make the provision does not constitute a violation of the provisions of s 71 of the Commonwealth Constitution with respect to the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth.  That section provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in the High Court, in such other Federal Courts as the Parliament creates, and in such other Courts as it invests with Federal jurisdiction.  But it can be exercised only by Courts, that is, Courts of Law in the strict sense:  The Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia v J.W. Alexander Limited (1918) 25 CLR 434 at 467; 9 Austn Digest 824: and it has been said that ""the exercise of the power to impose penalties is admittedly an exercise of the judicial power"": ibid at 445.  The tribunal provided for by s 4 of the Black Marketing Act 1942, is certainly not a Court, and it is at least open to question whether a provision which, in effect, enables such a tribunal, after secret inquiry, to dictate to a Court of Justice whether or not it is to inflict a minimum penalty in case of conviction, is not an attempt to invest a tribunal which is not a Court with part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth.  The question is an important one, but since the point has not been taken on behalf of the applicant in the case now before us, I abstain from passing judgment upon it.""   
(The ""tribunal"" to which the Chief Justice referred was the advisory committee that advised the Minister.)  
68The point was taken in Ex parte Coorey.  The argument of Mr Hardwick KC and Mr Hungerford at 293 - 294 reveals that the complaint was that the Black Marketing Act sought to vest judicial power in the Executive (element two of Mr Karim's argument).  There was a related complaint as to the non-judicial character of the tribunal.  By majority, the Court upheld this second argument.  Jordan CJ was alone, however, in upholding the argument that the provision sought to vest judicial power in the Executive.  After a discussion of the centrality of the separation of judicial power from executive and legislative power, the Chief Justice at 298 - 299 accepted that it was within the Commonwealth's legislative competence to create new offences and to prescribe penalties for them, which may be fixed, or maximum or minimum or both, and that it was competent for Parliament to authorise the Attorney-General to decide whether a person should be prosecuted and to make such permission a precondition to such a prosecution and to provide for the Attorney-General to seek advice about that decision.  These acts of advice and decision were recognised by the Chief Justice to be a legitimate part of the function of the Executive.  The vice perceived by the Chief Justice was that the Black Marketing Act did not create new (in the sense of differently worded) offences, but stigmatised existing offences with a label and different (and more severe) penalties.  The result was as stated by the Chief Justice at 300 - 301:  
""What is purported to be done by the Black Marketing Act is to enable the Attorney-General, in particular cases chosen by him, to constrain a Court of Justice, in the event of conviction upon a summary prosecution, to impose a minimum penalty of three months' imprisonment and authorise it to impose a maximum penalty of twelve months' imprisonment, and upon a prosecution upon indictment to constrain it to impose a minimum penalty of twelve months' imprisonment, whilst, if the Attorney-General chooses not to exercise the authority thus purported to be conferred, the case if prosecuted is governed by the general law under which the accused, if convicted summarily, cannot be imprisoned for longer than six months, and the Court has a discretion as to what term of imprisonment is proper, whilst if prosecuted on indictment the term of imprisonment is at the discretion of the court.  The Act does not delegate to the Attorney-General the power to alter, by a legislative act operating generally, the penalties attached to certain offences.  It leaves the existing penalties generally operative, but it purports to authorise him, in particular cases chosen by him, to dictate to a Court of Justice that at least a certain penalty shall be imposed in the event of conviction, no such minimum being generally operative.  It was pointed out in Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia v J.W. Alexander Limited (1918) 25 CLR 434 at 444 that ""convictions for offences and the imposition of penalties are matters appertaining exclusively to"" the judicial power: c.f. Kemp v Neville  (1861) 10 C.B. (N.S.) 523 at 547.  In my opinion, as regards all acts which are offences independently of the Black Marketing Act, that Act purports to invest a person who is not a competent Court with part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth, in that it purports to enable him at his discretion to dictate the penalty in particular cases.  If a Commonwealth statute provided that, if the Attorney-General when prosecuting a person for particular classes of offence inserted a specified word in the information or indictment, the Court in the event of a conviction should hold its hand, report the fact to him, and then impose such sentence as he might direct, the provision would be obviously bad.  In my opinion, the fact that the penalty is dictated in advance of the trial does not make the encroachment on the judicial power of the Commonwealth any the less real.  It is necessary to add that there may be cases in which the Black Marketing Act does more than attach an epithet to an existing offence, and itself creates a new offence.  For example, in the National Security (Prices) Regulations, the only prohibition against paying for declared goods more than the maximum price is contained in reg. 32, which prohibits the payment of more than the price fixed under the Regulations.  It was held by this Court in Ex parte Zietsch; Re Craig (1944) 44 S.R. 360; 61 W.N. 211; Austn Digest (1944) 137 that this did not make it an offence to pay more than a maximum price fixed by a regulation.  By s 3(a) of the Black Marketing Act 1942, ""black marketing"" is defined to mean (inter alia), paying for any goods at a greater price than the maximum fixed by the regulations.  Hence the Act here creates a new offence, and in relation to this offence the Attorney-General, when deciding whether or not a person is to be prosecuted for black marketing, is not deciding whether he is to be subjected to penalty A or penalty B, but is deciding whether he is to be prosecuted at all, penalty B being the only available penalty if he is.""  
69The vice perceived by Jordan CJ reflected the second element of the argument of Mr Karim.  If it reflected the accepted legal principle (subject to the argument of the Crown on the text of the old provisions), it would be determinative of the appeal in Mr Karim's favour.  The argument (and the view of Jordan CJ) is that the question is to be viewed as one of substance and not form, and, effectively, the Executive is able to decide a question or questions pertaining to sentence by a choice between offence A and offence B.  
70The Chief Justice was, however, alone in holding this view.  Davidson J and Nicholas CJ in Eq were both of the view that the Black Marketing Act, s 4 was Constitutionally valid.  It is necessary to refer to their reasoning because in the High Court in Fraser Henleins their reasoning was expressly adopted by various members of the Court.  
71Importantly, at 312, Davidson J described the argument and the issue in two ways:""The issue turns on whether the Committee itself or the Attorney-General or both acting together, are authorised to exercise a judicial function although not a Court, or whether the functions they do exercise interfere invalidly with the judicial power of the tribunal invested with the function of hearing and determining charges under the Act.""  
72The first way of putting the matter captures the second element of Mr Karim's argument; the second way goes close to capturing the third element.  In any event, it is clear that what was at stake was the Constitutional validity of the provisions, however one expressed their impugnment.  
73Davidson J expressed the view that it was entirely a matter for the Executive to choose the charge to be laid:  312; and the advice taken was ministerial and part of that process: 313.  The Committee and the Attorney-General were not exercising judicial functions. Davidson J said that minimum penalties were permissible.  In expressing his views about the duality of offences under the two bodies of legislation and the harshness of the possible results, Davidson J expressed himself forcefully at 313 - 314: 
""The peculiarity of the Black Marketing Act is that it merely attaches another name and exceedingly high minimum penalties to offences already created under the National Security Act 1939, which by s 10 are misdemeanours punishable without prescribed limit upon indictment and within prescribed maximum limits upon summary conviction.  Then under s 4(4) of the Black Marketing Act, the Attorney-General is vested with the power of deciding upon facts and advice, which cannot be checked by cross-examination or by hearing the accused person, that the latter shall be exposed to the risk of much more serious punishment than is provided by the regulations made under the other Act which creates the offence that has been committed.  The result is that, if on the evidence before the Court it is found that only a technical breach of the regulations has been committed, or there is no real criminality or moral turpitude, the minimum penalty provided by the Act must be imposed, although considered by the Court to be entirely unsuitable.  The gross injustice of such a procedure has already been exemplified in another proceeding which recently came before this Court:  Ex parte Gerard (1944) 61 W.N. 232; Austn Digest (1944) 131.  There, possibly because other information was placed before the Committee and the Attorney-General than that which was submitted as evidence before the Court and which was, therefore, presumably inaccurate, the punishment inflicted was outrageously disproportionate to the offence of which the accused was found guilty.  Fortunately the proceedings were so defective in other respects that the conviction was set aside.  In the present case also the penalty is excessive, but the immediate question is solely whether the Attorney-General was lawfully vested with the power he has exercised.  No doubt the legislature realised the extreme danger of persons being subjected to ignominious and serious punishment which the circumstances disclosed by the evidence might not warrant, and therefore endeavoured, by the advice of a preliminary secret investigation, to render the risk of such a result less likely.  But in reality what has happened is that a member of the Executive has been furnished with the power to say with regard to offences, the punishment of which has already been provided for and vested in the Judiciary, that the latter shall no longer exercise their discretion in that respect, but in some instances, if there is a conviction, shall award not less than the minimum penalty although that penalty may be considered, having regard to the facts, to be oppressive."" (emphasis added)  
Davidson J recognised the potential gross injustice of the prosecution under the Black Marketing Act and, implicit within that, the potential for inequality of outcomes by reference to two offenders.  
74The reasoning of Davidson J concluded at 314 - 315, with, to a degree, an emphasis on the form of the legislation that had been eschewed by Jordan CJ, as follows:
""In this sense the Legislature of the Commonwealth has vested in the Attorney-General a power which is not judicial and although it has the effect of limiting in some degree the discretion of the Court in imposing penalties, that limitation only operates in the future upon a contingency of a conviction by the Court.  The position would perhaps be different had the Parliament enacted that the judicial tribunal before which the charge was heard might only record a conviction in order that the penalty might be assessed and imposed by the Attorney-General or the Executive.  In such circumstances there would be a decision upon transactions had as involving the creation of an instant liability at that stage on the person convicted.  Then there would be a judicial as distinct from either a legislative or executive act.  But in the conditions that are actually under consideration the act of Parliament remains purely legislative and is not open to attack.  In my opinion, therefore, such a form of legislation does not impinge upon any restriction to its operation under the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (63 & 64 Vict. c. 12), and this objection to the conviction on these grounds must also fail.""  
75The reasoning of Nicholas CJ in Eq at 318 - 320 was to similar effect, though expressed more briefly.  
76Arguments as to the Constitutional invalidity of s 4 of the Black Marketing Act were put to the High Court in Fraser Henleins.  Latham CJ at 119 - 120 could see no judicial power being exercised by the Attorney-General or the Committee.  The choice of charge, he said, imposed no penalty, though it exposed a person to the risk of a particular penalty.  He agreed with the reasoning of Davidson J and Nicholas CJ in Eq in Ex parte Coorey.  Starke J at 121 - 122 refused to characterise anything done by the Attorney-General as other than administrative.  He also rejected the notion that the legislative prescription of maximum and minimum sentences was an exercise (or usurpation) of judicial power, saying at 121 - 122: 
""It cannot be disputed that the legislature has power to prescribe sanctions for the acts which it prohibits.  And, if a maximum penalty, why not a minimum penalty; that is a matter of policy and not of law, however harsh and unwise the legislation.  Consequently, the contention that the Black Marketing Act contravenes s 71 of the Constitution fails, as was also held by a majority of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Ex parte Coorey.""  
77Dixon J at 124 - 125 adopted the reasoning of the majority in Ex parte Coorey.  McTiernan J adopted the conclusion of the majority in Ex parte Coorey.  Williams J at 139 refused to view the Attorney-General's or Committee's role as anything but administrative and saw the exercise of judicial power as having commenced at the launch of the prosecution.  
78The effect of Fraser Henleins is that the High Court has held Constitutionally valid an Act which provides for mandatory minimum sentences for offences identical to other offences created under other Commonwealth legislation with different and lower sentences.  The legislation is not invalid as investing those who make the choice of charge with judicial power, nor as interfering with the exercise of judicial power in the sentencing process.  These conclusions were reached notwithstanding the express recognition in the reasons of Davidson J (adopted by Latham CJ, Starke J, Dixon J and apparently McTiernan J) that the regime of dual penalties (one being mandatory) for effectively the same conduct could produce gross injustice.  
79Mr Karim's submission was that this Court was not bound to apply Fraser Henleins in defeating the first element of his argument.  I disagree.  The conclusion as to the validity of s 4 of the Black Marketing Act may not have involved considerations of equal justice; but it was a decision of the High Court on a relevantly identical legislative structure, with cognate Constitutional arguments.  Further, notions of gross injustice were rejected as irrelevant.  To put Fraser Henleins to one side would be, to use the words of Brennan CJ in Ravenor, to employ a new argument contrary to a holding of the High Court to undermine the authority of that decision.  
80The first element of the argument fails.  
The second and third elements - the invalid conferral of judicial power on the Executive and the empowerment of the courts as indispensable and impartial tribunals
81There is a close relationship in argument between the second and third elements and they will be dealt with together.  
82It was accepted by Mr Karim at the hearing of the appeal that the second element of the argument was foreclosed by Fraser Henleins.  Notwithstanding that concession, it is helpful for the purposes of the third element to understand how it was put in argument, prior to the acceptance of the binding effect of Fraser Henleins, that the second element was made out.  
83I should add, at this point, that not only was Fraser Henleins more than a significant obstacle to the success of the second element, but the later decision of the High Court in Palling v Corfield [1970] HCA 53; 123 CLR 52 also stood in its way. The case is of relevance, not only as to how Mr Karim put his second element (and indirectly how he put his third) but also to the broader submissions of the Commission on mandatory minimum sentences.  
84In that case, Mr Palling was charged with an offence under s 49(1) of the National Service Act 1951 (Cth) of failing to attend for a medical examination upon being required by notice under the Act to do so.  Section 49(2) of the National Service Act provided that upon the conviction of a person under s 49(1), the Court shall, if the prosecution so requests, ask the convicted person whether he was willing to enter into a recognizance to comply with the requirements of any notice for medical examination, and that if no such undertaking be given the court shall sentence him to imprisonment for seven days.  The magistrate found the offence under s 49(1) proved, and adjourned the hearing pending its transfer to the High Court for the argument as to the Constitutional invalidity of s 49(2).  
85The arguments put as to Constitutional validity were as follows.  First, s 49(2) sought to vest part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth in the prosecution.  The Court was merely the conduit for the automatic consequences of the choice made by the prosecution.  It was accepted that Parliament could fix an automatic sentence without giving the Court any discretion, but it could not fix an automatic sentence conditional upon the request of a person.  The activation of the condition is part of the judicial power, as a binding and authoritative decision that leads consequently to a recognizance or imprisonment.  It is effectively the power to determine the nature of the sentence.  Fraser Henleins was distinguished as only concerned with the choice of charge, not with a condition so close to the act of sentencing.  Secondly, whether or not part of the judicial power was vested in the prosecution, s 49 constituted an interference with a court exercising federal jurisdiction in violation of the separation of power provided for in Chapter III.  The court was taking direction, or was required to act on a request, from a third party.  This way of putting the matter can be seen to anticipate the jurisprudence that underpins the third element of Mr Karim's argument.  Thirdly, s 49(2) was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the prosecution to determine the appropriate penalty.  
86The first argument above did contain a concession that the Parliament could fix a mandatory sentence.  The legitimacy of a mandatory (minimum) sentence without more was not attacked by Mr Karim in the way he argued the appeal (though his written submissions and the arguments of the Commission did challenge this).  
87The Court rejected all the arguments.  In so doing, Barwick CJ said, amongst other things:
(a) at 58
""It is beyond question that the Parliament can prescribe such penalty as it thinks fit for the offences which it creates.  It may make the penalty absolute in the sense that there is but one penalty which the court is empowered to impose and, in my opinion, it may lay an unqualified duty on the court to impose that penalty.  The exercise of judicial function is the act of imposing the penalty consequent upon conviction of the offence which is essentially a judicial act.  If the statute nominates the penalty and imposes on the court a duty to impose it, no judicial power or function is invaded:  nor, in my opinion, is there any judicial power or discretion not to carry out the terms of the statute.
...
It is not, in my opinion, a breach of the Constitution not to confide any discretion to the court as to the penalty to be imposed.""  
These are unequivocal words supporting the legitimacy of mandatory sentences and the removal of discretionary sentencing authority from the court.  
 (b)  at 58 - 59 
""Also it is within the competence of the Parliament to determine and provide in the statute a contingency on the occurrence of which the court shall come under a duty to impose a particular penalty or punishment. The event or the happening on which a duty arises or for that matter a discretion becomes available to a court in relation to the imposition of penalties or punishments may be objective and necessary to have occurred in fact or it may be the formation of an opinion by the court or, in my opinion, by some specified or identifiable person not being a court. The circumstance that on this happening or contingency, the court is given or is denied as the case may be any discretion as to the penalty or punishment to be exacted or imposed will not mean, in my opinion, that judicial power has been invalidly invaded or that judicial power is attempted to be made exercisable by some person other than a court within the Constitution. The fact that the happening of the event or the formation of the opinion is in reality determinative of the penalty or imprisonment to be ordered does not make the bringing about of the event or the formation or communication of the relevant opinion by some person or body other than a court an exercise of judicial power. There may be limits to the choice of the Parliament in respect of such contingencies but the nature of the contingency in this case does not require any examination or discussion as to the existence and, if they exist, the nature of such limits.""
These are unequivocal words rejecting the essential propositions of Jordan CJ in Ex parte Coorey and, in the second element of Mr Karim's argument, the proposition that the imposition of the sentence nominally by the Court, but necessarily consequent upon a contingent decision of a member of the Executive, was the (wrongful purported) attempt to vest judicial power in the Executive.  
 (c) at 59:
""Further, the Parliament may leave it to the executive to choose one of two alternative procedures for the prosecution of an offence, the penalty or punishment being determined either absolutely or within prescribed limits by the process of prosecution.""
These are unequivocal words rejecting the essential proposition of both Jordan CJ in Ex parte Coorey and, in the second element of Mr Karim's argument, the proposition that the Executive's act of selecting the charge from overlapping offences with different sentencing consequences involved a choice in the Executive of a judicial character. 
88Barwick CJ then quoted from, and agreed with, the judgment of Latham CJ in Fraser Henleins.  
89The other members of the Court expressed similar views.  Menzies J, at 63, noted that the three ways in which the argument was put were not separate.  Much the same comment may perhaps be made here about the three elements of Mr Karim's argument.  Menzies J said that the three ways of putting the argument foundered on a misconception of the role of the prosecution.  The initiating request was not the exercise of judicial power.  He made this clear in the example he gave at 64 and in the reliance on Fraser Henleins, as follows:
""To initiate judicial action in such a way is not, however, to exercise judicial power. An enactment that, upon conviction for murder, the court shall sentence a convicted person to death, unless the prosecution should ask for a sentence of imprisonment, which, in that event, the court shall impose for such term as it decides, would vest in the prosecution the power of negativing the imposition of the death penalty and requiring a sentence of imprisonment, but, in exercising that power, the prosecution would not be exercising judicial power; it would be exercising an administrative discretion upon non-judicial grounds. The ground might be to carry out some government policy, of which the prosecutor had been made aware; it might be on account of the age, the sex or the infirmity of the person convicted; it might be because of the circumstances of the killing; it might be without any particular reason at all to justify it. The prosecution would not have to justify any request which it made. An arbitrary request would be just as effective and as unchallengeable as a request based upon the most compelling of reasons. If authority that the exercise of an administrative authority in connexion with proceedings in court is not the exercise of judicial power be required, it is, I think, to be found stated clearly in Fraser Henleins Pty Ltd v Cody (1945) [1945] HCA 49; 70 CLR 100, and particularly in the judgment of Latham CJ (1945) 70 CLR at pp 119 and 120.""
90Windeyer J agreed with the other members of the Court.  
91Owen J at 66 - 67 applied Fraser Henleins to defeat the primary argument that judicial power was conferred on the prosecution.  Owen J separately rejected the argument about the interference with judicial power by the condition of prosecutorial request in connection with a mandatory sentence.  He said that there was ""no substance in the submission"": 67.  
92Walsh J at 68 expressed himself unequivocally concerning mandatory sentences: 
""It could not be disputed, and was not disputed, that the Parliament may make a valid law by which no discretion is given to the court as to the punishment of a person convicted of an offence. The Parliament may itself specify what sentence is to be imposed. When an Act requires a court, upon an offence being proved, to pass a mandatory sentence this does not involve any unconstitutional intrusion by the legislature into the field of judicial power. The relevant exercise of judicial power, when there is a prosecution for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, consists of the application of the law by the court, according to the terms of the law. If the Act provides for a mandatory sentence, the only power of sentencing which the court has in that case is the power to impose that sentence."" 
93Walsh J then at 68 - 69 expressed himself unequivocally concerning the conditional imposition of a mandatory sentence.  In so doing he applied Fraser Henleins.  At 70, Walsh J described the argument that s 49(2) was an impermissible interference with the processes of the Court as ""untenable"".  
94Thus, Fraser Henleins and Palling contain powerful statements (some only dicta, but strongly expressed and considered dicta) to the effect that mandatory sentencing provisions are within the authority of Parliament, that Parliament can provide for the mandatory sentence upon a condition or request effected by a third party, being a member of the Executive, that that legitimate condition or request includes the prosecutorial choice between two offences for the same conduct carrying differing sentencing regimes, one having a mandatory minimum penalty, that such a choice does not involve conferral of judicial power on the prosecution or any direction of the Court by the prosecution and that such laws are valid even in circumstances where they operate with gross injustice.  
95It is to be noted, however, that in Palling, Barwick CJ did say at 59 that there may be limits to Parliament's choice of contingencies.  
96To return to Mr Williams' enunciation of the second element of Mr Karim's argument, he relied on Chu Kheng Lim at 26 - 28 and 36 - 37.  The essential relevant proposition said to flow from these passages is that the Parliament cannot direct a court as to the manner and outcome of the jurisdiction exercised by the Court.  This essential proposition has been applied in later High Court cases:  Gypsy Jokers Motorcycle Club Inc v Commission of Police [2008] HCA 4; 234 CLR 532 at 560 [39]; International Finance Trust Co Ltd v New South Wales Crimes Commission [2009] HCA 49; 240 CLR 319 at 360 [77]; and South Australia v Totani [2010] HCA 39; 242 CLR 1 at 48 - 49 [70] - [72], 63 [132] - [133] and 66 [143] - [144].
97The argument was that Chu Kheng Lim and these later cases enunciate a new principle overtaking the reasoning in Fraser Henleins and Palling.  Apart, however, from the binding force of these two decisions and the propositions able to be extracted from them to which I have referred above, two further things can be said.  First, the cases after Chu Kheng Lim express the principle in terms of the impairment of the courts as independent and impartial tribunals.  This reveals the clear interconnection between the second and third elements of Mr Karim's argument.  Secondly, though the principle was expressed thus in Chu Kheng Lim and later cases, that does not mean, on the existing authorities, that the prosecutorial choice of charge, where there are overlapping charges, necessarily falls to be characterised as a direction to the Court as to the manner and outcome of its jurisdiction.  The reasoning embodied in the judgments in Fraser Henleins and Pallings and the majority in Ex parte Coorey was to the effect that the executive and judicial roles were separate, that there was no executive act that interfered with the exercise of judicial power, that Parliament prescribed the penalties that the courts (and only the courts) imposed, in respect of charges chosen by the executive within its legitimate sphere of activity, and that there was no direction of the Courts by the Executive.  
98The reasoning in Fraser Henleins, Palling and Ex parte Coorey can be seen to defeat not only the second element of Mr Karim's argument, but also the third.  Before the third element to the argument can be seen to impugn the validity of these provisions, it would be necessary to negate the propositions extracted from those cases.  
99It can be accepted that French CJ in Totani at 48 - 49 [71] recognised that Parliament's authority to pass a law requiring a court to make specified orders upon the satisfaction of a condition, which may be a decision of the Executive, was subject to the qualification that this power ""will not authorise a law which subjects a court in reality or appearance to direction from the Executive as to the content of judicial decisions"".  That qualification, of itself, does nothing to alter the reasoning or conclusions in Fraser Henleins, Palling and Ex parte Coorey that in circumstances there, which are on all fours with the circumstances here, there is no direction to or interference with the court or judicial power that it exercises, by the Executive's choice of charge, and that both the Courts and the prosecution act within their legitimate fields of Constitutionally recognised power. 
100Support was sought from the legislative history of old s 233C to conclude that the provision cannot be regarded merely as conferring jurisdiction on a court with a duty to exercise sentencing power upon conviction.  The jurisdiction to sentence offenders for an offence under s 232A already existed, independently of, and prior to, old s 233C.  That does not, however, foreclose a choice available to Parliament to legislate for a higher penalty accompanied by mandatory minimum sentences, if it considers it appropriate, assuming Fraser Henleins applies.  That the provision was intended to be a strong general deterrent does not detract from its legitimacy in this respect.  
101Embedded within the submissions concerned with the third element is a consideration to which I will come in dealing with the submissions of the Commission:  that the task of sentencing is, in the final analysis, essentially judicial in character and Parliament cannot direct a mandatory minimum sentence.  That cannot withstand Fraser Henleins, Palling and Ex parte Coorey (including the reasons of Jordan CJ).  
The submissions of the Human Rights Commission
102The first matter that needs to be addressed from the submissions of the Commission is the submission made in Mr Karim's written submissions and later abandoned by him at the appeal, that mandatory minimum penalty provisions of themselves are unconstitutional.  
103The aforementioned argument was supported by the Commission by reference to international human rights principles that were said to have been absorbed into the common law of Australia, against which the Constitution is to be interpreted and applied.  
104The starting point is to recognise that the authorities to which I have referred:  Fraser Henleins, Palling and Ex parte Coorey, to which one may add R v Ironside [2009] SASC 151; 104 SASR 54; Lloyd v Snooks [1999] TASSC 117; 9 Tas R 41; and Wynbyrne v Marshall  [1997] NTSC 120; 117 NTR 11, have recognised the validity of mandatory minimum sentences.  
105These authorities speak against the basal proposition that is essential to the success of any argument that mandatory sentences are unconstitutional: that the notion of judicial power has developed to a point whereby it can be said that the judicial function in sentencing necessarily entails a sufficient element of evaluative discretion to enable the court to reach an appropriate and just sentence, or avoid an unjust, arbitrary or cruel sentence.  The potentiality of injustice in mandatory punishment is impossible to gainsay:  see Sir Gerard Brennan, ""Mandatory Sentencing: Rights and Wrongs"" (2001) 7(2) Australian Journal of Human Rights 3; D P Cumaraswamy, ""Mandatory Sentencing: the Individual and Social Costs"" (2001) 7(2) Australian Journal of Human Rights 7.  Such potential for injustice directs attention to the very essence of law and the implicit content of judicial power in a Constitutional structure for the ages.  As Windeyer J said in Cobiac v Liddy [1969] HCA 26; 119 CLR 257 at 269:  
""Especially when penalties are made rigid, not to be reduced or mitigated, it might seem improbable that Parliament would not retain a means of escaping the imposition of a penalty which must follow upon conviction, that it would abolish it, not directly but by a side wind. This is not because mercy, in Portia's sense, should season justice. It is that a capacity in special circumstances to avoid the rigidity of inexorable law is of the very essence of justice."" (emphasis added)
106The historical development of the common law has seen many offences accompanied by fixed and mandatory punishment, often capital.  Historical analysis does not, however, provide an exclusive premiss for a conclusion that in the present state of development of the common law and how it views the nature of, and content of, judicial power, there are no limits to the legitimate use of mandatory sentences.  The Commission sought to draw out these matters by reference to fundamental human rights:  the prohibition on cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment and the inherent concept of gross disproportionality therein:  Art 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and Art 3 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and Vinter & Ors v United Kingdom [2012] ECHR 61; the prohibition of arbitrary detention and the guarantee of a fair hearing:  Art 9 of the ICCPR; the principle of equal justice:  Art 14 of the ICCPR and Art 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and the right to a review of sentence:  Art 14 of the ICCPR.  
107No argument was put, nor could it be put, that these international instruments were binding in Australia without more.  What was put was the relevance of fundamental international norms to the development of the Australian common law, against which Constitutional norms and implications are to be recognised and articulated.  
108Constitutional principles, to a degree, are interpreted and applied having regard to changing circumstances of society:  Australian National Airways Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [1945] HCA 41; 71 CLR 29 at 81; Victoria v Commonwealth [1971] HCA 16; 122 CLR 353 at 396 - 397;  Singh v Commonwealth [2004] HCA 43; 222 CLR 322 at 385 [159].  The interpretation of a fundamental law by reference to its common law context, and the effect on the common law of the content of the fundamental law are deeply intertwined processes.  The relevant Constitutional norms here are those concerned with the functioning of the judicial branch of government and, as such, are peculiarly capable of being affected by, and affecting, the common law notions of judicial power, judicial method and inhering conceptions of justice and fairness.  
109The norms and conceptions of fairness, justice and equality before the law have informed the development of substantive and powerful legal and Constitutional principles:  see the principles and cases at [53] - [55] and [96] above.  To which can be added Kioa v West  [1985] HCA 81; 159 CLR 550 at 584 - 586, 601, 612 - 615.  
110Parliament's expression of view as to the seriousness of a matter or of the proper content of a societal norm will, subject to the process of judicial interpretation and to the constraints of any relevant Constitutional limitation, be law.  To the extent, however, that any relevant Constitutional limitation rests in whole or in part on human and legal conceptions such as fairness, justice and equality, the assessment of the content and reach of any such Constitutional limitation cannot be concluded, forestalled or foreclosed by Parliament's statement or assertion of the social norm or of its satisfaction of those conceptions.  That is for the Courts authorised to interpret the law and to decide questions of Constitutional validity.  
111The operation of norms of fairness, justice and equality before the law and their reflections in a lack of arbitrariness, and a lack of differential treatment or discrimination without a reasonable relation to a proper objective, characterise the judicial process and its expected outcomes.  
112If one were to approach these provisions here, shorn of the binding effect of Fraser Henleins and Palling and the majority in Ex parte Coorey, and if one were to assess the judicial process in the necessary operation of old s 233C and new s 236B, the following could be said.  
113One aspect of the context of the creation of the offences of people smuggling and the related aggravated offences was the need for significant deterrence for participation in serious crime. I have earlier referred to the significance and seriousness of the conduct, and the danger it poses, not least to the people who are smuggled.  The mandatory minimum sentences were intended to form part of that legislative structure of deterrence.  
114The geographical and historical context of the legislation would lead one to expect that seafarers of countries nearby to Australia, in particular Indonesia, might participate in the voyages of persons to Australia.  The physical, social and economic circumstances of such voyages were likely to include the following:  fishing vessels of various sizes, ages and conditions of seaworthiness, and crews of various ages and skills, often uneducated, illiterate and indigent, hailing from communities marked by those disadvantages.  The seafaring responsibilities of crew would be likely to vary from unskilled deckhand to master.  Of course, those on board may include those who are intimately involved at a commercial or organisational level with people smugglers.  
115Against such an obvious context the relevant provisions are cast widely and generally.  New s 233C only requires an offender to ""facilitate"" the smuggling to Australia of five people who have no lawful right to come.  Any member of the crew by the conduct of his or her shipboard duties would fall into that category.  Old s 232A also requires ""facilitation"", but involves an element of recklessness.  Once again any member of the crew would fall into that category.  
116The mandatory minimum penalties are severe, indeed harsh.  That is the will of Parliament:  for other than a repeat offence, say a first offence, imprisonment for five years (with a three year non-parole period), which may be inflicted upon an illiterate and indigent deckhand, in circumstances where he or she or someone like him or her could have been prosecuted under a provision whereby the sentencing judge would have the duty to assess all the offender's circumstances, including the objective seriousness of his or her offending before deciding on an appropriate sentence.  
117The offender (thus incarcerated for 3 to 5 years) could be justified in concluding, in a simple way, that, as a matter of substance, he or she had his or her sentence in a significant respect dictated, in advance, by a decision of the Australian executive government by its choice of one of two alternative charges, and that his or her stay in prison has been determined out of public view for reasons of administrative or political choice, and not law.  The offender could think that he or she has been treated in a way that was unequal to either someone charged under the other provision or to his or her legal responsibilities to the Australian community under the other provision.  
118That simple approach attracted the support in 1944 of Sir Frederick Jordan. To use and paraphrase the words of Sir Frederick Jordan, in a civilised community the exercise of such power to incarcerate should not be so transparently a choice for the Executive without the existence of any relevant differentiating factor between the two provisions, both dealing with substantially the same conduct.  As reasoning to a legal consequence, however, this approach is precluded by the authorities to which I have referred.  
119The norms and conceptions inhering in the exercise of judicial power incorporate from their roots in the common law the norms that now characterise international human rights - a rejection of inequality, arbitrariness, discrimination, unfairness, injustice and cruelty.  That the common law and legal punishment in earlier eras exhibited a severity that might shock today, does not mean that by the values and political and legal structures of the time any severity could not be justified, nor does it mean that contemporary conceptions of punishment need embrace any such severity.  Indeed, these considerations reveal the effect of changing circumstances on the content of law and its informing norms.  
120For mandatory minimum sentences to be unconstitutional, a Constitutional constraint upon Parliament must be recognised that the assessment of a just and appropriate sentence is ultimately a judicial task, by the deployment of judicial method.  The reconciliation of such a proposition with the authority of the Parliament to set societal norms involves deep questions of the relationship between Parliament's power and the inhering essence of law and judicial power.  The source of an affirmative answer to the question of the existence of such constraint may lie in the rooted strength of the conception of equal justice and of the rejection of any power in Parliament to require courts to make orders that are arbitrary, grossly disproportionate or cruel by reference to inhering norms of fairness, justice and equality.  
121Here, in relation to these offences, an illiterate and indigent deckhand having little or no knowledge of, or contact with, the organisers of the smuggling, and knowing little about the voyage in respect of which he or she was charged, pondering his or her incarceration for five years for a first offence, could legitimately conclude that, at a human level, he or she had been treated arbitrarily or grossly disproportionately or cruelly.  
122Once again, existing authority precludes such notions informing reasoning to a relevant legal consequence. 
123If I may respectfully say, it may be that a view as to the potential injustice of the operation of mandatory minimum sentences led to the direction on 27 August 2012 by the Commonwealth Attorney-General to the Director of Public Prosecutions under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth), s 8(1) that prosecutions under new s 233C were not to be instituted, carried on or continued against a crew member, unless it was a repeat offence, or the person's role extended beyond being a crew member or a death had occurred on the voyage.  If I may also respectfully say, the salutary amelioration of the potential arbitrary and harsh effect of s 233C on illiterate and indigent foreign seafarers by such direction rather makes Sir Frederick Jordan's point as to the central place of the Executive in the sentencing outcome under the section's operation with two overlapping provisions.
124The helpful submissions of the Commission founder on the same rocks as those of Mr Karim.
125The appeals must be dismissed.  
126The resentencing of the applicants therefore does not arise.  It was quite plain from the argument, however, that the applicants or some of them would be likely to seek special leave to appeal from the dismissal of the appeals.  In these circumstances, whilst it may not be appropriate to hypothesise what a differently constituted court might do on sentence, it is not inappropriate that I express my view that if the mandatory minimum sentence provision were held to be invalid, there would be grounds on which it could be argued that the sentences for these applicants were excessive.
127The orders that I propose are:
1. Grant leave to the Australian Human Rights Commission to intervene as amicus curiae.
2. The application for leave to appeal against sentence of Sakarias Alomalu be dismissed.
3. The applications for leave to appeal of Mr Mursid Karim, Mr Bimbi Yusuf Bin Lahaiya, Mr Bayu (aka Ilham Dahlan) and Mr Bonang Darius Magaming be granted.
4. The appeals of Mr Mursid Karim, Mr Bimbi Yusuf Bin Lahaiya, Mr Bayu (aka Ilham Dahlan) and Mr Bonang Darius Magaming be dismissed.
128McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of Allsop P in draft. I agree with his Honour's conclusion expressed in [94] for the reasons he gives.
129I would prefer to express no concluded view about the situation if these decisions were not binding on this Court. Although the criminal law initially developed as part of the common law it must now be viewed as primarily the province of the Parliament, both to define the conduct which will constitute an offence and the parameters within which an appropriate penalty for that offence may be determined by a court. It cannot be doubted that Parliament can fix the maximum penalty which may be imposed. If Parliament can provide the maximum penalty I would presently be inclined to the view that it may also provide the minimum penalty which may be imposed.
130With respect to the decision to prosecute it has also been accepted that it is the role of the executive to prosecute for an offence. Furthermore, it is the prosecutor who must determine the offence to be prosecuted. This will of course determine the parameters of the available penalty if the offence is proved. 
131When there is a choice between prosecuting either a Commonwealth or State offence it has been accepted that the executive has a discretion, which is not confined, to determine whether to prosecute under one or the other provision. It has also been accepted that any sentence which is imposed should reflect the sentence required for that offence without consideration of the penalty which may have been appropriate if proceedings had been brought for a breach of the other provision: R v El Helau (2010) 267 ALR 734; Staden v DPP (2011) 254 FLR 467; Pantagis v The Queen [2012] VSCA 160.
132With respect to the applications for leave to appeal against sentence I would also prefer not to express a view. In my judgment to do so would be artificial and unfair to the relevant individuals. It requires this Court to determine a sentence for offences where the prevailing pattern of sentences has been fixed by reference to legislation which is presently the law, but which, for this purpose, must be assumed to be invalid. Unless and until set aside by the High Court I do not believe any court should endeavour to identify an appropriate sentence other than in accordance with that legislation.
133I also believe that it would be unfair to the individual offender for this Court to determine the sentence which it would have imposed if it could have set aside the relevant legislation. It would have the effect of informing the relevant person that, but for the fact that the Parliament has provided a minimum term, the sentence which has been imposed is excessive thereby heightening any sense of personal injustice which they may feel. The true position is that the present sentences are just because they are the sentences which the law as provided by the Parliament requires be imposed. 
134For these reasons I agree with orders 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the orders proposed by Allsop P.
135HALL J:  I agree with orders 1, 2, 3 and 4 as proposed by the President, for the reasons set out in his Honour's judgment.
136BELLEW J:  I agree with orders 1, 2, 3 and 4 as proposed by the President, for the reasons set out in his Honour's judgment.

		15 February 2013",2013-02-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760970,KW v R [2013] NSWCCA 31,"Judgment
1On 30 March 2010 the applicant was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing five counts.  The charges were:
(i): aggravated indecent assault on a person under the age of 16 years (21 months) (the circumstance of aggravation being that the offence was committed on a child under the authority of the applicant), alleged to have been committed on or about 20 December 2008, an offence against s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900;
(ii), (iii) and (iv): produce child pornography, alleged to have been committed, respectively, on 20 December 2008, 21 December 2008 and 21 December 2008, offences against s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act;
(v): possess child pornography, alleged to have been committed on 14 January 2009, an offence against s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act.
In respect of each offence, the maximum penalty provided by statute is imprisonment for 10 years.  In respect of the first count, pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") a standard non-parole period of 8 years is prescribed.
2On arraignment, the applicant entered a plea of guilty to the fifth charge (possession of child pornography) and pleas of not guilty to all of the other charges.  A jury was empanelled and a trial took place.  On 8 April 2010, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to each of the four counts.
3There followed a lengthy delay, much of which was occasioned by the fact that the judge was, immediately following the trial, absent from the Court on an extended period (6 months) of leave.  On 9 March 2011 the applicant was sentenced by Hosking DCJ, as follows:
Count (i) (indecent assault, child under 10 years): imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 8 years, commencing on 7 April 2010;
Counts (ii), (iii) and (iv) (produce child pornography): imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months, commencing 7 April 2010, and therefore to be served concurrently with (and subsumed within) the previously imposed sentence;
Count (v) (possess child pornography): imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, also commencing on 7 April 2010, and also to be served concurrently with and subsumed within the first imposed sentence.
The overall sentence is therefore that imposed in respect of Count (i).  All other sentences are subsumed within that sentence.
4The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences.  He does not appeal against the convictions.  


The facts
5Ordinarily, the task of a judge sentencing following trial is to find the relevant facts, so long as those facts are not inconsistent with the jury's verdicts.  Here, because of the lengthy period between conviction and sentence, it was difficult for the judge to find the facts on that basis.  To assist him, two statements of facts, previously prepared for use in the Local Court, were put before him.  These substantially formed the basis for his fact finding, although he did also resort to his recollection of the evidence in the trial.  No objection is taken to this approach to finding the facts.  However, it has given rise to one ground of appeal.  (The statement of facts has the common deficiency of focussing on the investigation, or the manner in which the offences came to light, rather than on what the offender actually did.  The facts are recounted in a rather unenlightening manner.)
6The victim of the indecent assault offence and two of the produce child pornography offences was the applicant's daughter.  Prior to September 2006, the applicant and the victim's mother had lived together in a de facto relationship.  A son, aged about 6 in December 2008, and a daughter (the victim) aged about 21 months at that time, were born.  In September 2006 the applicant and his then de facto separated.  The applicant thereafter had regular access to the children; they stayed with him (at his mother's house) on alternate weekends and parts of school holidays.
7In about December 2008 the victim was sitting naked in a bathtub.  The applicant used his finger to penetrate the labia majora.  This constituted the indecent assault offence (Count (i)).  Using his mobile telephone, the applicant photographed the event.  The photograph shows the child sitting in the bathtub, with the applicant's finger penetrating her vagina.  This constituted the first offence of producing child pornography (Count (ii)).  The applicant took a second photograph of his daughter, seated, with her legs apart.  Central to the photograph, prominently displayed, is the child's vagina.  This constituted the second offence of producing child pornography (Count (iii)).  The third such offence (Count (iv)) was constituted by the applicant photographing the body of a young boy from the lower abdomen to above the knees.  The photograph shows the boy undressed, his penis exposed in the centre of the photograph (Count (iv)).  The applicant acknowledged that the subject of this photograph, whose face could not be seen, was his 6 year old son.
8The applicant was also in possession of a lap top computer and associated electronic and data storing devices.  Included in the material stored in these devices was a considerable volume of child pornography, in photographs, video and movie film form.  This constituted the offence the subject of Count (v), to which the applicant pleaded guilty.  
9A scale to grade child pornography, with ratings from one to ten in escalating order of gravity (or depravity) has been devised.  This is called ""the Copine Scale"".  The material on the computer included images fitting within various of these categories.  A detailed analysis of the categorisation of the material was provided to the sentencing judge.
10The Statement of Facts also contained some rather cryptic descriptions of the various images and material.  These were expanded upon by his Honour, who apparently viewed some or all of the images.  This Court was not invited to take that course.
11The applicant's offences came to light when he left his mobile telephone in a Centrelink office.  On 14 January 2009 it was found by a woman who, intending to attempt to locate its owner and return it, examined its contents.  In doing so, she observed the three photographs of the two children.  She handed the telephone to police.
12Police traced the telephone to the applicant.  On 15 January he was arrested and cautioned.  When informed of the reason for his arrest, the applicant said that he had taken the photographs because his children had eczema, and he intended sending the photographs to their mother to show her how the medication he had been using had been working.  In fact, the applicant gave various accounts and explanations for his possession of the material.  At one point he denied having seen the photograph the subject of Count (ii), and said that his son often used his telephone to take photographs of his sister.  He said that he could not clearly identify whether the hand in the photograph was that of an adult or that of his son.  He said that he did not have any other images of the kind.  He declined to allow police to remove the computer at his home without a search warrant.  
13Later that day a search warrant was executed at the applicant's home, and the computer equipment was located.  The applicant admitted ownership of the equipment and denied that it contained any pornographic material.  He was then released from custody pending further investigation and forensic examination of the computer equipment.  That examination revealed the images the subject of the count of possession of child pornography (Count (v)).
14On 19 January the applicant contacted police and asked to speak to one of the officers involved in the investigation.  He said that he now remembered the photograph of the finger in the child's vagina, and that he now recalled that his son was taking photographs and that he (the applicant) had put his finger in his daughter's vagina to remove some zinc and castor oil cream.  He was then asked about pornography on the computer equipment and said there were some ""video and stuff I was just looking at through LimeWire"".  (A psychiatric report, to which reference will be made below, described ""LimeWire"" as a ""peer to peer file sharing website"".)
15The applicant then left the police station but shortly after again rang the police officer and said that he now remembered that there were other files and material from LimeWire on the computer.  
16In a second interview, the applicant repeated that he had taken the photograph of the baby girl to send to the child's mother, to show how a new cream was working.  He gave a similar explanation for the photograph of his son.  He said that he had not in fact sent either photograph.  
Victim impact statement
17A Victim Impact Statement signed by the victim's mother was provided to the sentencing judge.  She gave it the heading ""Broken"".  She wrote of her frustration at not knowing precisely what had happened to her children, and the effect that that had upon her.  She described what she called a behavioural change in her son.  She said that he had changed from a happy enthusiastic child to an ""all round sad little boy"" lacking trust in adults.  She said he had lost a father and a grandmother all at once, for which he held a lot of anger and sadness.
18She said that her daughter was too young to give any account of the effect on her but said that her body language was revealing.  She said her daughter is very clingy and untrusting of anybody not within her family.  There was a good deal more in this vein but that is sufficient to give a flavour of what the victims' mother said was the impact of the offences on her family.
The applicant's personal circumstances
19The applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings.  Some medical evidence, including a psychiatric report, was tendered.  It is from this report that the applicant's personal history is to be obtained. 
20The psychiatrist, Dr Furst, took a detailed history from the applicant.  He was born in January 1977 and was almost 32 years of age at the time of the offences.  He told Dr Furst that his father was a violent alcoholic from whom his mother separated when the applicant was 4 years of age.  He did not see his father again for 10 years, when there was a brief reconciliation between his parents, and then not again for another 5 years.  He found his mother ""stifling"", to the point of ""emotional incestuous[ness]"".  He said that she imposed strong religious demands on him.
21He described himself as ""very intelligent"", and felt that he should be able to ""set his own boundaries"", and ""explore the World and see what society is all about"".  He self-diagnosed Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (a diagnosis that has not been formally confirmed).  The applicant told Dr Furst that he had downloaded the LimeWire material out of intellectual curiosity but said that he was ""repulsed"" by what he saw.  He understood that it was wrong to view the material.
22He described to Dr Furst a head injury as a pedestrian in 1995 (at age 18) and raised the possibility of brain damage.  Dr Furst diagnosed traumatic brain injury, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and pre-morbid anti-social personality traits.
23Although Dr Furst thought that the applicant had ""sufficient intelligence and presence of mind to understand that his actions were wrong"", he also considered that his cognitive deficits and personality change (presumably post brain injury) magnified his pre-existing anti-social tendencies and contributed to his offending behaviour.
The remarks on sentence
24The sentencing judge set out the facts in the manner I have described above.  In describing the offence the subject of Count (i) his Honour said:
""The photographs included one of a very young girl who appears to be sitting naked in a bathtub with a finger, the tip of which appears to me to be penetrating the child's labia majora."" (bold added)
25He referred to the evidence of the applicant's personal circumstances in a manner to which no objection is taken.  This included extensive reference to Dr Furst's report.  He referred to the Victim Impact Statement, but observed that he was not in a position to conclude that the behaviour of the children, or the mental state of the mother, were attributable to the offences with which he was dealing.  He determined that he could not take that material into account for sentencing purposes.  
26His Honour recognised that, in respect of the first count, because it was subject to a standard non-parole period and the provisions of Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, it was necessary that he assess where, on a scale of objective gravity, that offence lay.  He accepted a Crown submission (contrary to that advanced on behalf of the applicant) that that offence was significantly above the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of its kind.  Indeed, he said that there was ""no escaping that classification"".  That was predominantly because of the age of the child at the time of the offence.  
27Again, in relation to that offence, he said:
""In relation to Count 1 carrying as it does the standard non-parole period of 8 years for an offence in the mid-range of objective seriousness, in my view, I cannot see any way that I can avoid imposing that sentence on him as the non-parole period for Count 1.  Even for what the offender did that in my own view is a very severe penalty and is significantly more than I would have imposed as a non-parole period even for this offence.  However, I am bound by the requirements of Part 4 Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Because that is my view I am not prepared to impose an even higher non-parole period even though I have assessed what the offender did in relation to Count 1 as being above the mid-range.""
Accordingly, he went on to impose that sentence, and the other sentences to which I have referred to above.  
28It is clear that his Honour was significantly troubled by the standard non-parole period.  An offence carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years, with a standard non-parole period of 8 years, presents a particularly difficult sentencing exercise.  In the course of argument, his Honour had made it plain that he considered that the specification of a standard non-parole period of 8 years in respect of an offence that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years to be unwieldy and unworkable.  This was a case in which, by reason of the applicant's pleas of not guilty, the standard non-parole period legislation (the Sentencing Procedure Act, Pt 4 Div 1A) applied: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168.  However, the emphasis to be given to the standard non-parole period is now known to be significantly less than was believed when Way was decided: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.  The judge was sentencing before the latter decision was published.
29Because of the difficulties he perceived in sentencing in respect of Count (i), the judge determined to impose fully concurrent sentences in respect of the remaining counts.  Moreover, he considered himself precluded from giving effect to a finding, that he otherwise would have made, that special circumstances within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act existed.  Such a finding would justify a modification of the non-parole period in relation to the head sentence.  Section 44 in effect requires that the non-parole period of a sentence is to be not less than three-quarters of the total sentence, unless the court finds that there are special circumstances justifying departure from that proportion.  It does not impose any prohibition, prima facie or otherwise, on structuring a sentence in which the non-parole period is greater than three-quarters of the total sentence.  It is generally accepted that a variation in the statutory proportions that results in a non-parole period less than three-quarters of the head sentence is a benefit to the offender.  Here, because the standard non-parole period is four-fifths of the maximum available sentence, there was little room for the statutory proportions.  That is why the sentence imposed appears to be unbalanced.
30In his discussion of the objective seriousness of the first offence, the sentencing judge said:
""The learned Crown Prosecutor submitted, correctly in my view, inescapably in fact, that if the touching of an eight year old girl in the shower on the outside of her vagina comes close to the worst class of case then it must be the position that the offender to place his finger perhaps just into [the victim's] labia majora.  That is to say of a twenty-one month old girl and to take a photograph of it must fall significantly above the mid range of objective seriousness for this kind of offence."" (bold added)
The first part of this passage was a reference to a decision of this Court in GSH v The Queen; The Queen v GSH [2009] NSWCCA 214 in which it was said that:
""... it is difficult to justify a finding below the mid range for an offence under s 61M(2) constituted by the touching of the genitalia of a nine year old girl.""
31At the conclusion of sentencing, the Crown representative, very fairly and properly, drew attention to the manner in which his Honour had recounted the facts of Count (i).  He is recorded as saying:
""Your Honour when making comment in the facts about what's depicted in the photographs said that the photographs depicted that the offender's finger was penetrating the labia majora.  I just want to make it perfectly clear your Honour's not sentencing obviously for a case of sexual intercourse and I just want to make that perfectly clear that your Honour is sentencing for an offence of aggravated indecent assault.""
The point of this was to ensure that his Honour had not fallen into sentencing error of the kind identified in The Queen v de Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383.
32His Honour replied by saying that he was well aware of that, and that he had included that reference because it was what the applicant himself had told police.  He made it clear that he had not sentenced the applicant for a more serious offence than that of which he was convicted.  
The grounds of appeal
33The grounds of appeal are pleaded as follows:
""1. The learned judge erred in determining the sentence on Count 1 on the basis that the standard non-parole period mandated a particular sentence when the objective gravity of the offence was of or above the mid-range of objective gravity;
2. The learned judge erred in finding that the appellant (sic) had committed a more serious offence, that is aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under 10, than the offence with which he was charged and convicted, namely aggravated indecent assault with a child under 10;
3. The sentence imposed on Count 1 was manifestly excessive.""
Ground 1: standard non-parole period
34It may be said at the outset that the Crown concedes that Ground 1 has been made out.  That concession was inevitable having regard to the decision of the High Court in Muldrock, delivered after sentencing in this matter.  That has the consequence that the Court must set aside that sentence, and proceed to sentence the applicant.  However, there is also a flow-on effect on the subsequent sentences, in respect of the total concurrency of all sentences, and in respect of the judge's approach to the finding of special circumstances under s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act.  Muldrock makes it clear that the judge was not constrained, as he thought he was, to impose a sentence that began with the standard non-parole period.  
Ground 2: de Simoni error
35The substance of the complaint under Ground 2 is that the judge, on two occasions, referred to penetration of the child's vagina.  Penetration is not an element of an offence against s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act.  It is an element of the more serious offence of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years, which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years (Crimes Act, s 66A(1)), or, in its aggravated form, imprisonment for life (s 66A(2)) and a standard non-parole period of 15 years (Sentencing Procedure Act, s 54B, and the Table to Div 1A).  One circumstance of aggravation is that the victim is under the authority of the offender (s 66A(3)(d)).
36The circumstances giving rise to Ground 2 arise because of the manner in which the facts were put before the sentencing judge.  This included the evidence given in the trial.  In recounting the facts, he could scarcely have avoided the reference to penetration and given an accurate account of the facts as they were put before him and before the jury in the trial (see [24] above).  The second reference, in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offence (see [30] above) was again a reference to the facts that had been proved.  His Honour accepted that the offence was ""significantly above the mid-range of objective seriousness"".  Even without reference to penetration, it was inevitable that the offence was of the most serious of its kind.  It is notable that the second reference to penetration was qualified by the word ""just"", thus diminishing any lingering impression that he treated the offence as one of sexual intercourse.
37The sentence that he imposed, although now shown in accordance with Muldrock to have been tainted with error, demonstrates clearly that he sentenced for the very offence of which the applicant was convicted.
38Notwithstanding his Honour's references to penetration, I do not accept that he sentenced on the basis that the applicant had committed the more serious offence of sexual intercourse.  
39In any event, as it is necessary to re-sentence the applicant, it is not productive to consider that further.
Ground 3: manifest excess
40It follows from what I have said about Ground 1 that Ground 3 also must succeed.

Re-sentence
41Against the possibility of sentencing, affidavit material concerning the applicant's personal circumstances since sentencing was put before this Court.  Although I have carefully read this material and taken it into account, it discloses no relevant change in circumstances.
42I accept, as did the sentencing judge, that the offence the subject of Count (i) was a serious offence of its kind.  The age of the child alone is sufficient to warrant that assessment.
43There is no reason not to give effect to the finding of special circumstances that Hosking DCJ made, but felt unable to give effect to.  I would adopt that finding, and structure the sentences - predominantly the aggregate sentence - to reflect that finding.
44No challenge was made to the length of the sentences imposed in respect of Counts (ii)-(v).  However, one consequence of the result in relation to Ground 1, and that the sentence to be imposed in respect of Count (i) will be significantly reduced, is that total concurrency is no longer appropriate.  I consider this to be a matter which does call for some accumulation.
45I propose the following orders:
(1) Leave to appeal granted;
(2) Appeal allowed, sentences set aside;
(3) The applicant be re-sentenced as follows:
Count (v): imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months, commencing on 7 April 2010 and expiring on 6 January 2014, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, expiring on 6 January 2013;
Counts (ii)-(iv): imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year and 6 months, commencing on 7 January 2011 and expiring on 6 July 2012 (I would decline to set a non-parole period in respect of these offences because the sentence will be fully subsumed in those imposed in respect of Counts (i) and (v): see Sentencing Procedure Act s 45(1));
Count (i): imprisonment for 5 years and 6 months, commencing on 7 April 2011 and expiring on 6 October 2016, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months, expiring on 6 July 2015.
46The aggregate is a total sentence of 6 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months.  The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 6 July 2015.
47HARRISON J:  I agree with Simpson J.
48ADAMSON J:  I agree with Simpson J.

		21 February 2013",2013-02-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760971,Penza and Di Maria v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 21,"Judgment
1HOEBEN JA:Nature of proceedingsThe appellants appeal against their conviction for murder, pursuant to ss 5(1)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
2The appellants were jointly tried in July 2009 in the Supreme Court before Justice Latham and a jury.  The indictment charged each of the appellants with the murder of Christian Minotte on 17 April 2006 at Mount Pritchard.  The trial was heard over 13 court days.  After deliberating for approximately three and a half days, the jury returned guilty verdicts on 30 July 2009 in relation to both appellants.
3The appellants were sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 18 years with a non-parole period of 13 years.  In the case of Mr Penza, his sentence commenced on 27 July 2007 with the non-parole period expiring 26 July 2020, and the balance of term expiring 26 July 2025.  In the case of Mr Di Maria, his sentence commenced on 24 August 2007 with the non-parole period expiring 23 August 2020 and the balance of term expiring 23 August 2025.  Mr Di Maria was also sentenced in respect of three counts of ""goods in custody"" under s 257C(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900, two counts of ""use instrument"" under s 300(2) Crimes Act 1900 and one count of ""knowingly make a false statement"" under s 307B Crimes Act 1900.  The sentences imposed for those offences were wholly concurrent with the sentences for murder and have now expired.
4The trial was conducted by the Crown on the basis that the appellants went to the home of the deceased, armed with a firearm, with the intention of stealing drugs and/or money concealed in a wall cavity in the laundry of his home.  The deceased was a successful drug dealer who was known by Mr Penza, his step-son, to keep cash and drugs in his home.  At some stage, the deceased confronted Mr Di Maria and a struggle took place, culminating in the discharge of the firearm into the deceased's head.  On the Crown case, the evidence did not disclose which of the appellants was directly responsible for the fatal shooting.
5The Crown put its case in two alternative ways, relying on the doctrines of extended joint criminal enterprise and constructive murder (the ""felony murder rule"").  The Crown prosecutor's opening address included the following explanation of the ways in which the prosecution would seek to establish the appellants' liability for murder:
""It is the Crown case that Frank Penza and Joshua Di Maria entered a joint criminal enterprise to commit an armed robbery, or aggravated break and enter depending on whether they needed to break into the house at number 24 Oliphant Street or whether the deceased would let them into the house and it was their intention to steal items from 24 Oliphant Street, including the contents of the wall cavity, and any other items of value.  It is the Crown case that both accused would have contemplated the likelihood that the deceased would resist any attempt to rob him including their knowledge that the deceased was a drug dealer and their knowledge, particularly on the part of Frank Penza, which he could have communicated easily to Joshua Di Maria, that the deceased had firearms in his home.""  (T.22.12)
""The basis on which the Crown seeks to make both of them liable for murder is as follows:  The Crown relies principally on the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise, common purpose to establish the liability of both the accused for the offence of murder ...  It is the Crown case that both accused entered a joint criminal enterprise to commit an armed robbery in company or specially aggravated break and enter in company and that each of the accused contemplated the possibility in carrying out this enterprise that one or other would discharge the firearm as indeed did happen with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased.  In particular, because they knew they were robbing a man who was a drug dealer, who had guns at the property, who knew who they were and where it would take considerable control over the deceased in order to break open and steal the contents of that wall cavity.""  (T.23.8)
""On a final legal basis ... the Crown also relies on the doctrine of constructive murder.  In this particular state, persons who become involved in offences that involve the maximum penalty of 25 years and in particular in this case, robbery with a dangerous weapon carries 25 years ... can also be found guilty of murder on this constructive murder basis.""  (T.23.23)
6It should be noted that the appellants were ultimately sentenced on that latter basis of liability, i.e. felony murder, which was accepted by the Crown as the appropriate finding to make on the evidence (R v Penza and Di Maria [2010] NSWSC] 16 at [2]).
7The Crown accepted that it had to establish to the criminal standard of proof, that the appellants attended the deceased's home while at least one of them, to the knowledge of the other, was armed with a firearm.  Proof of this circumstance was a necessary aspect of the extended joint criminal enterprise case, as it founded the alleged contemplated possibility that one of the accused would discharge the firearm with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased.  That circumstance also constituted an element of both of the two foundational offences relied on to establish felony murder, and in this sense was a necessary aspect of the alternative felony murder case.  The offences of aggravated armed robbery in company and specially aggravated break enter and steal, contrary to  s97(2) and ss 105A and 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 respectively, both have as an element, that the accused was armed with a ""dangerous weapon"", which is defined to include a firearm (s 4 Crimes Act 1900).
8The Crown relied on a number of pieces of circumstantial evidence to prove that the appellants went to the deceased's home armed with a firearm.  In written and oral directions given to the jury, the trial judge summarised this circumstantial case and set out six areas of the evidence.  Those six areas were the subject of detailed challenge in the first ground of appeal.
9The respective defence cases did not dispute that the appellants were present at the deceased's home when the fatal shot was fired.  Nor was it disputed that at a point before the shooting, the appellants formed an intention to steal from the deceased.  To this end, the appellants accepted that they entered the laundry area of the deceased's premises and demolished a wall cavity in their search for drugs and money.  However, it was the appellants' case that neither of them was armed when they attended the deceased's home.
10The appellants relied upon the following grounds of appeal.
Ground of Appeal 1:  The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
Ground of Appeal 2:  The learned trial judge erred by failing to direct the jury that, in respect of felony murder, the act causing the death had to be voluntary.
Ground of Appeal 3:  The learned trial judge erred by failing to leave manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act for the jury's consideration.
Ground of Appeal 4(a):  The evidence relied on by the Crown to establish consciousness of guilt on the part of the appellants was inadmissible.Ground of Appeal 4(b):  The learned trial judge erred by directing the jury that they could engage in consciousness of guilt reasoning in relation to the appellants.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND CONDUCT OF TRIALThe Crown Case
11At about 7.30am on the morning of Monday, 17 April 2006 two heroin addicts, Danielle Thorn and Jeffrey Mills, drove to the deceased's home at 24 Oliphant Street, Mount Pritchard intending to buy heroin.  They approached the front door, which was unlocked and open, which was unusual.  Mr Mills stayed at the door while Ms Thorn went inside.  She called out and walked through the house to the back observing that the back door was ""wide open"".  She looked down the stairs and saw the deceased face down, partly on the grass and partly on the path.
12She called out to Mr Mills and he, having walked through the house, saw the deceased lying at the bottom of the stairs on his side.  Ms Thorn rang 000 and followed instructions which she was given to attempt to revive the deceased by using CPR.  She rolled the deceased over and observed that he had a rock in his hand, which rolled out and left his hand in a clawed position.  Mr Mills remained at the top of the stairs.
13Ambulance officers arrived and told them to wait for the police, who arrived a short time later.  Sergeant Young, one of the attending police officers, noted that Mr Mills seemed affected by drugs and observed an apparently fresh ""track"" mark on his arm.  Mr Mills had been there about 8.30pm the night before and had bought, as usual, a ""gram"" of heroin for which he generally paid $300 cash.
14Ms Thorn's boyfriend was the deceased's nephew, Daniel, who was also a heroin user.  Ms Thorn often purchased heroin and cocaine from the deceased and sometimes she asked him for drugs on credit.  She had last seen him at midnight.  Generally she knocked on the door and called out to him and sometimes she rang in advance.  She called out because ""sometimes he wouldn't answer until he knew who it was"".
15Ms Thorn was aware that the deceased slept in the bathroom because he was ""paranoid ... he would sleep right behind the door so he could keep the door closed and the toilet's there so he could flush his drugs down the toilet"".  The deceased told her that someone had gone to his house and threatened him.  He also thought the police were watching him.  In her opinion, he had been more paranoid in the past two months.
16The ambulance officers were told on arrival that the deceased had apparently fallen down the stairs.  One of them, Ms Symonds, noted that the deceased's right hand was stiff and in a claw-like position, giving the impression of having held something.  She saw a brick near the hand.
Dr Little - forensic pathologist
17Until Dr Little conducted a preliminary examination at the scene, it was thought that the deceased had died from a fall down the stairs at the back of his home.  Dr Little noted a gunshot wound to his head and a large number of less serious injuries to his face, arms and legs.
18The autopsy showed that the deceased had died from a gunshot wound.  The projectile entered the deceased's left parietal scalp, 15cms back from the midline of the forehead and 3cms down from the top of the head.  The entry hole was 4mm in diameter and the edge was abraded/grazed, as is common in such wounds.  The projectile - which Dr Little presumed was lead - from its appearance and the fact that it broke up inside the head - passed through the brain and into the skull on the opposite (right) side.  She considered it to be a ""distant range"" shot, as there was no evidence of the markings which are expected in either ""contact wounds or intermediate range wounds"".  The projectile passed through the left scalp and across to the right and slightly downward and was retrieved from the right side of the skull by Dr Little.
19In the course of the autopsy, Dr Little found a plastic bag containing seven coloured balloons lodged in his oesophagus, just above the stomach, which were later shown to be cocaine.  She opined that the bag had not been there long ""no more than a few minutes"", because otherwise it would have progressed further into the digestive tract.  
20Dr Little also found and identified about 51 separate abrasions/grazes on the body of the deceased, virtually all of which were fresh and ""non specific"" but were not consistent with having been punched or dragged.  She said that there were too many to be explained by one or two falls.  She gave detailed evidence of the particular grazes.  In particular, there was a graze on his forehead which was consistent with him having been hit with a blunt object, or having fallen against a blunt object.  Dr Little said:
""Potentially he could have not died straight away ... he was more likely to have stumbled and moved in a very uncoordinated fashion ...  it's quite possible that he could have been shot under the house and still made his own way out to where he was found.""  (T.300)
21Dr Little was unable to be of assistance as to where the deceased may have been immediately before the shot was fired.  She said:
""It would depend on where the person shooting him was standing.  For example, although it's a downward angle on the gunshot wound, if the person was in an elevated position in comparison to him, they could shoot him while he was standing, and similarly, he could have been crouching, sitting, lying.""  (T.300-T301)
22In answer to a jury question as to likely time of death, Dr Little provided a very qualified estimate which was 1.30am.
23The following question was asked and reply made by Dr Little:
""Q.  Please advise the technical definition of intermediate and long distant shot in terms of metres?   Are you able to pass any comment in relation to that question?A.  I can make some comments.  It may be better made by a ballistics expert, but I have done some reading around it.  Basically the only way you can really determine the exact distances for any one gun is to test fire it.  It depends very much on the gun.  It's different for handguns versus rifles.  It's different depending on the type of ammunition, particularly the type of powder with the ammunition.  That will give a different distance that you get.  The spray pattern that causes the tattooing that gives you the intermediate range one but on average for a .22 calibre weapon, which is what I understand this weapon was, depending whether it's a handgun or a rifle, it could be anything from half a metre to a metre.  That would be where the intermediate range ended and the distant range started.""  (T.556)
DNA and blood evidence
24Michelle Franco, a DNA expert, gave evidence.  This placed both of the appellants at the home of the deceased at the relevant time.  Until the trial, the evidence from Mr Penza in his ERISPs was that he was last at the deceased's place ""three weeks, probably a bit less"" and that he had last been in the laundry ""not lately, but probably before I moved out, returning all his tools"".
Ballistics
25The firearm, which discharged the fatal shot, was not found at the premises, nor was it ever recovered.  Evidence was given by Detective Sergeant O'Hagen, a ballistics expert.  Upstairs in the kitchen, which opened off the rear stairs and veranda, she located a discharged bullet, a ""concave gutter"" mark on the back door and a bullet mark on the wall above the stove.  She noted a trajectory from the gutter mark on the back door to the wall above the stove from where the bullet bounced off to the floor.  She could not say how close the gun was to the back door when it was fired, nor determine the calibre of the bullet because of the impact damage it had suffered.  There was no evidence as to when the gutter mark damage to the back door occurred or how old was the bullet mark above the stove.  
26Police located two spent cartridge cases on the laundry floor.  Each was .22 long/long rifle calibre.  They were identified as coming from two different manufacturers, Winchester and PMC.  Although it could be established that they had been discharged from the same firearm, the type of firearm could not be determined.
27There were fragments of a .22 calibre Winchester bullet lodged in the skull of the deceased.  Because the firearm used was not recovered, it was not possible to compare that bullet with the spent cartridges in the laundry in order to determine if they were from the same weapon.  Similarly, it was not possible to determine if the damaged bullet found on the kitchen floor came from either of the spent cartridges on the laundry floor.  A comparison of the bullet found in the deceased's skull with the bullet found on the kitchen floor was inconclusive in that it could not be determined that they were fired from the same weapon.  
28Detective Sergeant O'Hagan test fired the weapons seized from the deceased's premises and found them all in working order.  She itemised the substantial number of weapons found in the deceased's laundry cache.  That list included two target pistols, which had been recorded as having been stolen, together with a third firearm from a registered gun owner.  The third firearm stolen (which was not one of the weapons found on the premises) was a Pardini model SP calibre 22 LR pistol, which Detective Sergeant O'Hagan said was designed to fire .22 long rifle calibre ammunition.  
29Detective Sergeant O'Hagan from her observations at the post mortem noted that there was a rim of blackening around the wound but no sooting or strippling.  Given the absence of sooting and strippling, her opinion was that the shot to the deceased's head was not fired from ""close"" distance, but without knowing the weapon that was used, the conclusion was that it was not ""hard contact"".  It was impossible to say whether the shot was fired from more than 5, 10, 20 or even 30 cms away.
Searches
30Police officers searching the house located a number of items which confirmed the evidence of others. $4,500 was hidden in a cavity between the doorframe and the wall of the wardrobe in bedroom one.  Members of the deceased's family referred to the deceased hiding money around the house.  The bathroom was found to contain a mattress, milk crates and buckets of water.  Other witnesses referred to the deceased being ""paranoid"" and sleeping in the bathroom.  
31Senior Constable Keighran searched the basement of the deceased's house which was converted into a laundry.  There was a brick cavity wall beside the doorway.  The cavity seemed to have been broken open and there was debris on the ground.  The weapons previously referred to were found in that cavity.
Evidence from neighbours around 24 Oliphant Street
32Glen Pitt could see into the backyard of 24 Oliphant Street from his front door.  On the night of Easter Sunday, 16 April 2006, into the early hours of Monday he was awake.  At about 4.20am he heard ""voices like calling out to someone"" but could not make out the words - the speakers seemed to be slurring their words.  The shouting went on for about five minutes.  He agreed that it could have been two voices.
33On looking out his door, he saw a male on the back balcony of 26 Oliphant Street:
""It sounded like he was wanting somebody to come out of the house ... yelling.  Then I heard what sounded like somebody wrestling, then a bang on the fence, and then I heard three gunshots ...  I thought [the noise] was coming from the younger guy's place ... it sounded like somebody was either going into [the Colorbond fence] or going over it ... [He then] heard three bangs ... it sounded like a cap gun ...  Next I sort of took a peek out of my [bedroom] window ... I seen a figure standing on the back step which looked like he had a white shirt on ... He [was] on the back step of number 24, the older guy's place ... [at the top] of those stairs or the top of those stairs ... he looked a bit woggy ... European ... he stood there for probably a minute and then walked down the stairs and walked up the side of the house [between 24 and 26] and left.""  (T.337-339)
34The time lapse between the wrestling sound, the bang on the fence and the three shots was about a minute, maybe just over.  By ""wrestling"" he meant ""the sounds of the slapping of bare feet on the concrete"".  Mr Pitt thought that the time between the first shot and the next two was only a split second ... five, maybe three seconds"" (T.348).  He was, however, certain that he heard the noise from the fence before the shot.
35Donna Gaal lived about 150m down the hill from 24 Oliphant Street.  On Easter Sunday night she was awoken by male voices yelling, one of which said ""Come back here"".  She then heard shots, which she first thought were crackers [but a bit louder].  
""Q.  Are you sure it was two loud bangs?A.  Yes.
Q.  How close were they?A.  Very close.
Q.  Seconds?A.  Yes.
Q.  Minutes?A.  No.  Seconds.  Bang, bang.""  (T.254)
The shots came from the same direction as the voices.  She thought that happened at about 2-2.25am.  However, she also got up at about 4.15am, and may have been confused about which of those times involved the shots.  At the time of giving evidence, she thought it was 2.15am.
36Wade Hughes lived in the street behind the houses at 24 and 26 Oliphant Street and could see part of both houses.  He knew Frank Penza, who lived at 26, whom he had spoken to, and his father, who lived at 24.  On occasions he had seen Frank ""hop over the little fence"" out the front, which was between the houses.   Mr Hughes was aware of a period of time during which the deceased was not living at 24.  He saw the deceased out the front of 24 at about 8pm on Easter Sunday.  At around 1.30am he heard ""a couple of sounds ... like crackers"", not ""very loud"".  At about 2.15am he heard a loud car going down Miller Place.
37Robert Hervey lived across from 26 Oliphant Street.  At about 3.30 - 4am on Easter Monday morning he heard ""a clunking sound"".  He got up and looked out his window at Oliphant Street, and saw a person in a red hoodie walking with a limp towards 24.
38David Fausett lived near 24 Oliphant Street and could see it from his place.  On Easter Monday morning between 1.30 and 3am, he heard two gunshots.  Later at about 6.55am that morning, he heard what sounded like a woman crying in the backyard of 24.
Evidence from the deceased's clients
39Maria Kapathiou bought cocaine from the deceased on Easter Sunday morning at Cabramatta Railway Station.  She could not always get to his house, although she had been there as a friend, as well as a customer.  She recalled an occasion about six months before he died when having dropped her off at Bexley, after he had supplied her, he was ""jumped"" by three Lebanese guys.  He told her to run away and they then went for him.  He told her that they would get nothing from him, except fictitious phone numbers and maybe $1000 cash.
40Amie Pate had bought heroin from the deceased between midnight and 2am on the day he died.  She was regularly buying from him about five times a day.  In her experience, he always packaged his deals in coloured balloons.  She had knocked and called out her name because ""he wouldn't open the door unless he knew who you were ... or if you didn't say your name clearly"".  It was the same for Danielle Thorn.  He made up the deals himself and would not open the door while he was doing that.
41She saw on that occasion that he had ""a big bag of deals ... thousands of dollars worth of deals"" with him.  She also knew that he ""always had a lot of money ... thick wads of cash"" because he would not deal in less than $100 buys.  She said:
""A.  He didn't like people coming there in the early hours, so he would try to get you to, you know, get what you've got to get until the morning.
Q.  But was it uncommon for yourself and other girls that you knew to go there between midnight and 5am?A.  No that wasn't uncommon ... [but] he didn't like it ... but he was up and ready for it.""  (T.483)
The deceased told her he was paranoid and had been sleeping in the bathroom on and off for weeks.
42Richard Leonard was both a customer and a friend of the deceased.  He bought cocaine once or twice a week and had gone to the house 20 to 30 times.  The deceased asked him to look after the house on the night of Easter Sunday while he was out for dinner with his girlfriend and Mr Leonard had agreed to do so.  The arrangement was simply to be at the house.  He was not to sell drugs for the deceased.  The arrangement was cancelled when the girlfriend became ill.
43Sheree Thomas gave a statement to police, but did not give evidence at trial.  She said that she used to buy heroin from the deceased from about October 2005 and at least four times a day every week since then.  She said that both she and Danielle Thorn bought $600 worth of heroin daily from him.  She said that most of his customers were women, since he did not trust men.  He had told her that he wanted a break from selling drugs because he ""had enough of people stuffing him around, owing him money, people ringing him and coming to his house late at night"".  He was agitated, angry and prone to lose his temper.
44She had arranged to be dropped at the deceased's home after 1.30am on Easter Monday.  She knocked on the front door and said her name.  He opened it immediately.  She knew he would not open the door without the person identifying themselves.  She saw him carrying about 40 deals in a plastic bag.  She bought a half weight of heroin for $135.  She arranged to return in the morning and he told her not to bring anyone with her.
Evidence of the deceased's family members and associates
45Maria Minotte, the wife of the deceased, said that she had adopted Frank Penza and his sisters when each was a child and they had regarded the deceased as their father, calling him ""Papa"".  In early 2006 she was living next door to the deceased at 26 Oliphant Street with her son Patrick and Mr Penza.  She went overseas in early March, but stayed in contact with the deceased with weekly calls.
46She said that throughout their marriage the deceased never kept his money in banks and regularly hid money in whatever house he was then living.  He hid money in the rangehood at 24 Oliphant Street and told her about how he had made a cavity in the wall in the laundry.  On about eight or nine occasions she exchanged amounts of Australian dollars (just less than $10,000) for American dollars as requested by the deceased.  He was always careful to prevent anyone taking his money.
47At the time she left for overseas, the relationship between the deceased and Mr Penza had deteriorated.  The deceased wanted him to ""grow up"", be more responsible by paying his rent and the electricity bill, by not going into his home without permission and to generally act like a 25 year old.
48She had known Mr Di Maria for years, as a friend of her children and thus of the family.  He was invited to Christmas dinner in 2005.  
49The deceased had been threatened three times (at the end of January, mid-February and the end of March) by some ""Lebanese guys"" who wanted his money.  He called them ""terrorists"" - they wore balaclavas.  She said that these Lebanese persons had come to his house on three occasions and were demanding money.  He was sleeping in his bathroom with plywood against the door because he was frightened.  She said he was frightened, upset and furious about it.  
50She was aware that he had firearms.  She knew that he had a sawnoff gun.  She said ""I just saw the wooden stick cut off - one barrel, single barrel on it I think it was, it looked pretty old.  I've seen the gun"".  She estimated the length of the sawnoff firearm to be 30cms.  She said that she had given this weapon to him before she went overseas.  She said ""it was just under the bed"".  She said that he had other rifles and ""always loved firearms"".
51Phillip Minotte was a son of the deceased.  He regarded Frank Penza as a brother.  He had known him and Mr Di Maria since childhood.  He said that the deceased was making the false cavity in the laundry before he went overseas in January 2006 when Mr Penza was living next door.  The deceased told him he was going to keep guns there and he had two or three guns (a rifle, pistol and a shotgun) at the time Phillip left Australia.  Patrick (his brother) and Mr Penza knew of the cavity.  Phillip was aware of the deceased hiding money in the wardrobe inside the house.  The deceased complained to Phillip that he had ""been jumped by some Lebbos at Bexley"" and that he had been threatened by ""Lebbos"".  His father always locked the doors and ""you had to knock on the door to get in"".
52Daniel Minotte was the nephew of the deceased.  He was the boyfriend of Danielle Thorn and a heroin addict.  He bought heroin from the deceased a few times each day, usually a ""gram"" for $300.  Most of the time Danielle actually conducted the transactions.  He knew that the deceased would only supply people he knew. 
53Frances Minotte (who was not a relative of the deceased) was in virtually daily contact with the deceased and spoke to him by phone on Easter Sunday at about 6pm.  She said that the deceased usually had a lot of cash with him, was security conscious and was always locking the door when in the house.  She had never seen the front door left unlocked.  The back door was open.  She was aware that he sold heroin and presumed that he kept it in the laundry.
54Patrick Minotte was a son of the deceased who grew up with Mr Penza and regarded him as a brother.  He lived at 26 Oliphant Street with Mr Penza for about six months.  He knew his father had built an extra wall on the left as one entered the laundry as a ""secret hiding spot"" at a time when Mr Penza was living next door.  The cavity was ""covered in"" and it was necessary to break it to remove what had been walled up in the cavity.  There was no other way to get at it.  In Patrick's absence the deceased ""probably took a few things ... some guns, money and jewellery"" and hid them in the cavity.  Patrick thought that his father was storing ""a minimum of $US250,000"" in the cavity.  He said that his father would have broken into the cavity to get things out and then remade it.  However, generally he would wait until he had built up some money before attacking the false wall.
55He agreed that when he and Mr Penza were living at 26 Oliphant Street, they would go onto their back balcony and yell out to his father.  When he came out, they would jump over the fence into number 24.
56Frank Amil was a friend of the Minotte family and had known Mr Penza since he was about three.  On Tuesday, 18 April 2006 he went to the McLaughlin home where he saw Mr Penza.  He asked what had happened to the deceased.  Mr Penza said ""I think it might have been competition"".  Mr Amil asked Mr Penza about the keys to the deceased's house saying that he had to lock it up.  Mr Penza said that he did have the keys but had lost them.  
57Mr Penza told Mr Amil that the police had asked him directly whether he had killed his father.  Mr Penza said that on the night of the murder, he had been at the McLaughlin's home drinking and left at 1am and went to Patrick's (being 26 Oliphant Street).  He denied going there with anyone else.
58Karen Heath had been in a relationship with the deceased in 2004, although they did not live together.  In about February 2005 the deceased commenced making the laundry more secure, including doing brick work because that was where he kept his cash.  She also knew that he hid money under the mattress and in the rangehood.  On occasions when she was at the deceased's house, people telephoned and turned up late at night.  The deceased would then go to the laundry for these people.  While she was only aware after his death that he had firearms, he had told her that he would not run from anything he would ""always stand up to anybody"".  
Evidence from friends of the appellants
59Troy McLaughlin was a friend of Mr Penza.  Mr Penza was at his home drinking when Troy arrived on the afternoon of Easter Sunday.  Troy left to buy alcohol and later Mr Di Maria arrived.  He too was drinking.  They (together with Trent Martin and Adam McLaughlin) were in a granny flat at the house watching TV.  Troy went to bed at about 10.30pm.  Messrs Penza and Di Maria were still drinking.
60Adam McLaughlin gave evidence to similar effect.  He said that Mr Penza had been drinking bourbon and coke and that Mr Di Maria turned up with a bottle of Remy Martin. 
61Christine McLaughlin confirmed that first Mr Penza and then Mr Di Maria turned up at her home.  They watched football and drank.  Later they were with her and her husband inside the house and were noisy.  She said that Mr Penza was ""pretty pissed"" and that she offered to drive them, which they declined.  They left together at around 11pm.  Trent Martin confirmed that evidence.
62Toni Green was Mr Di Maria's girlfriend at the time.  She said that she had breakfast with Mr Di Maria on Easter Monday at about 8.30 - 9am.  She did not notice any different mood or injuries on him.  When they returned to his home, they found Mr Penza on the lounge just waking up.  He had no shirt on.  She did not notice any injuries or change from his usual mood.
63At about 9pm on Easter Tuesday, Mr Di Maria came to Subway where she worked and said that he was leaving for Malaysia immediately and that she should join him there as soon as she could.  In answer to her question why he was going that night, he asked ""If I loved him and if I trusted him"".  He gave her the keys to his Toyota Cressida which she left at her family home.
64She said that in the preceding weeks they had discussed going to Malaysia ""within the next couple of weeks"" but no date had been set.  She left Australia for Malaysia on 21 April 2006 and travelled with him to Bangkok, Rome, Milan and Sicily.  The last three destinations were not mentioned in the original discussion.  Mr Di Maria paid for everything using cash which he had.  A good deal of that cash was in US dollars.  When they were in Bangkok for the second time, she insisted that Mr Di Maria pay $3000 - $4000 for liposuction for her.  He also had some surgery on his nose.
65She returned to Australia alone about three months later after an argument, but Mr Di Maria paid for the ticket.  He did not return to Australia until substantially later.  Although they remained in contact, they later broke up.  At some stage in the relationship, Mr Di Maria told her that he had received a payment of about $30,000 - $40,000 as a result of an injury.
66Yasmin Nada was Mr Penza's girlfriend from November 2005 and she lived with him, Patrick Minotte and Patrick's girlfriend at 26 Oliphant Street from December 2005 until moving out on 30 March 2006.  She had met the deceased and understood him to be Mr Penza's stepfather.  
67Having spent Easter Sunday morning with Mr Penza, she dropped him at the McLaughlin's place around 2pm and next saw him at her parents' place at about 10 - 11 o'clock the following morning.  She and Mr Penza had spoken on the phone around 8am.  Mr Penza told her that after drinking at the McLaughlin's house, he had gone to the home of Mr Di Maria and had more drinks.  Mr Di Maria dropped him at her parents and she did not notice any scratches on him.  Later on the Monday afternoon, Mr Penza was rung by Mrs McLaughlin and told that the deceased was dead.  She said that he was ""too upset to talk about anything"".
68Wayne Clarke, a friend of Mr Penza, was visited at his home by him the day after the deceased was killed.  Mr Penza asked if he had heard about ""Papa"".  Mr Clarke noticed that Mr Penza had ""scratch marks ... on his arms and a couple on his neck"".  Mr Penza said that he had got them from fixing Phil's car.  When Mr Clarke saw Mr Penza at the wake for the deceased, the latter said that he had been at his girlfriend's house the night the deceased was killed and that ""he was upset and that he said that he was getting set up for Chris Minotte's murder"".
Other police/investigation evidence
69Ms Chan gave evidence concerning gunshot residue.  She said that such residue was volatile and recovery/identification of it depended on various factors.  The absence of it did not necessarily mean that the person or item had not been associated with a gun being fired.  She examined the vehicle used by Mr Penza and Mr Di Maria to go to and from the deceased's home and found no such residue.
70Mr Malone was the officer-in-charge.  He produced immigration records showing Mr Di Maria's departure from Australia on 18 April 2006 and the fact that there was no record of his returning using that name.  It was common ground that Mr Di Maria had returned to Australia under another name.  He produced identity documents in the name of ""Michael Shane Watkins"" which Mr Di Maria had obtained.  Mr Di Maria was arrested on 24 August 2007, having been initially pulled over by other police officers.  Mr Di Maria ran from the car and was pursued.  Mr Malone conducted both records of interview with Mr Penza.
Records of interview of Franco Penza
71Mr Penza agreed to recorded interviews with the investigating police on 18 April 2006 and on 6 June 2006.  He made no admissions as to his involvement in the death of the deceased.
72Relevant parts of the first ERISP were:  The deceased was selling heroin and cocaine from 24 Oliphant Street to at least 20 people per day, and also delivering it.  Mr Penza said that he did not know where the drugs were kept and when asked to guess, suggested ""his room or kitchen"".  He said that cash would ""probably"" be kept in the house but did not know where.  The last time he was at the deceased's house was ""three weeks probably a bit less"" and that he had last spoken to him ""probably four days ago"" as he was driving past.
73Mr Penza saw cuts on the deceased's arm a couple of months ago, i.e. during the last two or three months.  The deceased said that ""some Lebbos tried to get him ... it was due to a client that he had that set him up or something"".  He said the ""Lebbos"" were trying to get him and rob him.  Mr Penza said that he used to jump the fence between his house and that of the deceased.
74He said that on the Sunday night he was drinking at the McLaughlin's house and got ""pretty pissed"".  He said that he left after his ""cousin Mr Di Maria"" brought a bottle of Remy Martin.  He then went up to Mr Di Maria's house in Smithfield, kept drinking and crashed out there waking up at about 10 - 11am.  He then went to his girlfriend's and then to her mother's house for dinner.  After that he received the phone call about the deceased's death.
75Mr Penza could not say when he was last in the laundry area of the deceased's house, but ""not lately but probably before I moved out, returning all his tools"".  He said that the weapons he knew of were a machine gun (maybe an M4), a .22, a .32, a few shotguns and a target rifle/pistol.  He said that the deceased had ammunition ""in a suitcase"".  Mr Penza specifically denied having anything to do with killing the deceased.  
76Mr Penza's second ERISP provided the same information.
77It should be noted that although many witnesses referred to the deceased having significant quantities of drugs at the house, no narcotics or other drugs were located by the police despite a thorough search.
The defence cases
78Mr Di Maria gave sworn evidence in the trial.  Until then he had not given any account of the events of 16 - 17 April 2006.  The following is a summary of his evidence, both in chief and under cross-examination.
79On Easter Sunday he went to the McLaughlin's house in the evening at about 7pm having collected a bottle of Remy Martin from home.  Mr Penza was amongst those present.  The persons there continued to drink into the evening.  He estimated that he drank half a bottle of the spirits which he had brought mixed with coke.  He and Mr Penza left between 9 and 11pm and went to his home about 10 minutes away.  They continued to drink and watch TV.
80At about 3.30am (he noted the time from his TV) he and Mr Penza discussed getting cocaine from the deceased.  Mr Penza drove Mr Di Maria's car and parked on the deceased's front lawn.  They went down the drive to the front door and saw that no lights were on.  They knocked on the front door, got no answer and knocked harder for about 5 minutes.  In the absence of a response:
""Frank said that he is probably out with one of his girls, and he goes ""let's go, let's go help ourselves"".  He goes, you know, ""I know where it is"".""  (T.574)
81They went next door to 26 Oliphant Street, down the driveway, through the gate and up onto the back veranda.  Mr Di Maria called out ""Chris, Chris are you there?""  Mr Penza called out ""Papa, Papa"", both using loud voices again for about five minutes.  (T.574 - 576)
82Mr Penza then took him to a spot on the common fence and they jumped over into the yard of 24 Oliphant Street.  Mr Penza said that the drugs were in the laundry, which was open.  They entered and turned on the light.  Mr Penza indicated a cavity wall and attempted to put his hand in the gap at the top where the brickwork was broken.  Mr Di Maria estimated the size of the gap at 20cm x 5cm.  They began to attack the wall with a chisel, then a sledgehammer.  After about five minutes, Mr Penza reached in and grabbed a sandwich bag containing cash and put it down his pants.
83Mr Di Maria reached in and pulled the handle off a bag trying to remove it.  Mr Penza said ""Let's go, let's go"" and then Mr Di Maria heard the deceased say ""Hey what's going on?""  Mr Penza turned the light off and ran to the fence, then got over it.  The deceased said ""Come or come back, or come back here"".  The next thing which happened was:
""Chris has come into the laundry and turned the light on.  He - says ""What are you trying to steal from me"" and he has pointed the gun at me, and the gun was in his right hand.  I put my hands up.  He has pulled the trigger, tried to pull the trigger again, but it seemed to be either jammed or unloaded.  So he put it in his left hand, and there was like a bolt action thing, and he has unloaded it and the shell's casing has come out ...  I could tell it was a sawnoff, it had a bolt action.""  (T.581)
84Mr Di Maria then picked up a nearby brick, threw it at the deceased's head, although not as hard as he could.  He hit the deceased's forehead.  He was afraid of being shot and tackled the deceased around his torso and remaining upright, they struggled out of the laundry.  As Mr Di Maria had a fractured finger which had not healed, he could not make a tight fist but he got the gun above the deceased's head - they were both holding it, he on the barrel and the deceased on the stock/handle.  Then the deceased fell backwards with Mr Di Maria on him.  Mr Di Maria felt a heavy item hitting his head at the back.  The gun was still above their heads.  (T.581-584)
""He was smashing me in the back of the head with a hard object.  Every time he was using an aggressive voice, each time he hit me and I was starting to get dizzy and I couldn't hold back any more, so I got up off his body and grabbed a hold of his arm.""  (T.587)
They were then on their knees, the barrel was getting 
""Closer ... to my person ... I couldn't hold him any longer because I was really dizzy and I felt I was drunk and he was too strong, I couldn't hold him back.  The gun was basically pointed at me, so I'm holding him like that, I have let go of the right arm to push the gun back.""  (T.587)
85The evidence proceeded:
""Q.  So you let go with your left arm; is that what you have indicated?A.  Yes.
Q.  You have indicated moving your left arm to where your right hand was which was holding the gun?A.  Yes.
Q.  You pushed back with both hands?A.   Yeah.  I grabbed hold of Chris and pushed him.  As I done this Chris - as I was holding the right arm, his body was sort of twisted.
Q.  Twisted which way, in towards you?A.  Towards this way, towards me.  
Q.  So he's gone right into the left part of your body; is that what you mean?A.  Yeah his right to my left, yeah.  As we have fallen back I pushed the gun back and it went off.
Q.  It went off?A.  Yeah.
Q.  Do you know whether you pulled the trigger?A.  I don't know.
Q.  To your knowledge were you touching the trigger?A.  I don't know.  As I done that in the one motion it went off.
Q.  Do you know whether the gun or any part of it hit the ground?A.  No.
Q.  When you pushed his arm back how were you feeling in relation to what he was doing?A.  I was really dizzy, I could see like white dots and my ears were ringing from the sound of the gun.
...
Q.  When the gun went off was that when he was bending forward and you were on your knees?A.  Yeah that's right.
Q.  The gun has gone off and he's fallen back has he?A.  (No answer)
Q.  Did you fall with him - you're nodding.A.  Yes.
Q.  What did you do?A.  Chris fell we both fell.  I grabbed the gun.
Q.  You grabbed the gun did you?A.  I tried to snatch it, I snatched it.  I got up to run but I stumbled because I was too dizzy so I wasn't in a position to exit the premises.
Q.  Why not?A.  Because I was too dizzy and my ears were ringing yeah.
Q.  Did you know whether Chris had been shot fatally at that stage?A.  No, I wasn't sure.  No, I wasn't sure.""  (T.588-589)
86The deceased immediately fell to the ground letting go of the gun.
""Q.  Did you do anything with the gun?A.  Yes.
Q.  What did you do?A.  I reloaded it.
Q.  How did you do that?A.  With the mechanism on the side.
Q.  You're indicating backwards and forwards?A.  Yeah the same thing Chris done when it, when he had pointed it at me, I done the same thing.
Q.  Why did you reload the gun?A.  Because I was scared he was going to come after me and attack me.  I wasn't going to shoot him with it.  I was just scared and I wanted to go home that's what I wanted to do, go home.
Q.  When you reloaded the gun did it discharge?  Did you see anything come out of the gun?A.  Shell casing.
Q.  Where were you in the laundry when you reloaded the gun?A.  Just inside the doorway.
Q.  How long did you stay in the laundry for?A.   One minute, two minutes something like that.
Q.  Did you decide to leave?A.  Yeah eventually, yes.
Q.  Did you look to see where Chris Minotte was before you left?A.  No, I was in the laundry.  I panicked because I didn't see - he didn't come back and I thought that maybe it was possible that he was dead but I wasn't sure and I panicked.  My blood was all over the gun, there was blood on the hammer.
Q.  Which hammer?A.  The sledgehammer that was sitting there.  I didn't know what to do so I was scared.""  (T.590)
87Mr Di Maria collected the firearm and the hammer and then called out to Mr Penza who did not respond.  He left through the side gate and saw that Mr Penza was in the car with the lights on and on the driveway at the front of the deceased's house.  He got in the car with the firearm and told Mr Penza to drive away.  When the latter asked what happened, he said ""I think I shot him"".  Mr Penza kept asking if the deceased was all right, he was ""in shock"".  They then went to Mr Di Maria's house.
88Later that morning Mr Di Maria disposed of the hammer and the firearm, having ejected the bullet which was left in his car.  Between the seats he found the plastic bag with the money in it, which Mr Penza had put down his pants in the laundry.  It was mostly US currency (about $US40,000) with some Australian ($AU5,000).  He later met up with Toni Green, his girlfriend and then worked on a car.  He decided to go immediately to Malaysia being ""scared of Phillip Minotte and his family"".  He had been to Malaysia before in March, shortly after he suffered the displaced fracture to his right forefinger.
89He said that he remained overseas for many months.  During that time he was told by a friend that his house and that of Toni Green had been searched by the police and that he was a suspect in the murder of the deceased.  He had money sent to him from Australia and obtained a passport in another name (Watkins).  He later got a driver's licence, a Medicare card and had utilities connected in that name.  He also had made some inquires through a solicitor about handing himself over to the police.  He specifically denied going to the deceased's house armed, or with any intention to kill or seriously harm him.
90In cross-examination, he said that he knew the deceased dealt in drugs from his home but that he (Di Maria) mostly bought from Phillip or Patrick Minotte.  When buying from 24 Oliphant Street, it was not always the case that someone went down to the laundry.  He agreed that the plan was to ""grab some drugs out of the wall"" at 24 Oliphant Street.  When the deceased turned up, Mr Penza was between him and the deceased so that the deceased could not see what was going on, except for the rubble on the ground.
91He said that he had known the deceased for seven or eight years and had no issues with him.  Once the deceased put the light on he said ""Do you want to steal from me cunt?"" then pointed the gun straight at his chest.  Mr Di Maria said he was unarmed and had his hands above his head but the deceased pulled the trigger while still pointing it at him.  He never told Mr Penza of the circumstances in which the deceased was shot.
92He said that the reason he returned to Australia under another name and not through Sydney was because he was scared of Phillip Minotte and the threats the police officer, Mr Malone, was making ""to my mum ... basically saying I'm a murderer.  It was just intimidation, I don't know just scared me"" (T.670).
""Q.  Mr Di Maria, the situation is that prior to you going over to number 24, Frank Penza had told you about there being more than just drugs in that wall cavity hadn't he?A.  No sir.
Q.  He told you about the money that you could find in that wall cavity hadn't he?A.  No sir.
Q.  And also the guns?A.  No.
Q.  That you and Frank Penza had armed yourself prior to going over to that house?A.  No sir.
Q.  And that it was one of you, either you or Frank, who fired the shot into the house that rebounded off the kitchen door?A.  No sir.
Q.  That anything that Christian Minotte did was an attempt to defend himself from you two who were there to attack and rob him?A.  No sir.""  (T.674)
93The appellant, Frank Penza, neither gave nor called evidence at trial.
THE APPEALGround 1 - The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 94It was common ground that the Crown was obliged to prove an indispensable intermediate fact, namely that the appellants went to the deceased's home armed with a firearm.  This meant that the Crown had to exclude a reasonable possibility that one of the appellants obtained use of the firearm when they were at the deceased's home.  In that regard, there was no issue that the deceased kept firearms in the house and that firearms were found in the wall cavity when the premises were searched.  The deceased's wife gave evidence of a sawnoff rifle with a similar description to the weapon referred to in Mr Di Maria's evidence.
95The appellants submitted that because of the deficiencies in the Crown case, the verdict ought not be allowed to stand.  They submitted that the problems in the Crown case were not of the kind that were capable of resolution by reference to a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence.  They submitted that no part of the case against the appellants relied upon findings of credit to be made, either for or against a particular witness, by the jury.  In that regard, the submissions by the appellants largely ignored the evidence of Mr Di Maria on the basis that for the jury to have reached the verdict which it did, it must have substantially rejected that evidence.  
96The appellants submitted that the issue was ""whether the jury, acting reasonably, must have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellants"" (Knight v R [1992] HCA 56; 175 CLR 495 at [21]).
97It is common ground that the case against the appellants was wholly circumstantial.  There was no direct evidence that either of them had a firearm when they went to the deceased's house.  It was agreed at trial that ""unless the jury can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused were armed when they went to the premises, then a verdict of guilty in respect of either of them cannot arise""  (T.697.36).
98The appellants accepted that, although by necessity, it was necessary to treat each of the factual matters or circumstances separately, it was the ""combination and totality"" of those circumstances taken together from which the Court should consider the reasonableness or otherwise of the jury's verdict.  The appellants acknowledged that in some cases, no single circumstance alone might sustain a verdict but viewed in totality, the combination of circumstances might allow the drawing of an inference of guilt.  The appellants submitted that in this case not only was each of the circumstances of itself weak, but taken together they still allowed for reasonable inferences consistent with innocence.  They submitted that taken at its highest, the circumstances in the Crown case could not exclude as a reasonable hypothesis that both appellants went to the deceased's house, but did not go there while armed.  Nor could those circumstances exclude the hypothesis that the deceased was shot with the sawnoff rifle which his wife said he possessed at that time.
99The Crown case relied upon six areas of circumstantial evidence.  The trial judge summarised that evidence in her written directions to the jury as follows:
""The Crown cannot prove the offence of Murder (either by way of extended joint criminal enterprise or by way of felony murder) unless the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that one of the accused was armed with a firearm to the knowledge of the other, when they went to Mr Minotte's house in the early morning of 17 April 2006.
In the absence of direct evidence that one of the accused was armed, to the knowledge of the other accused, the Crown relies upon the following items of evidence to found that inference:
(a) The existence of the ""gutter"" mark in the back door, together with the depression left in the kitchen wall, beside the rangehood, and the projectile on the floor of the kitchen.
(b) Knowledge of the accused Penza that Mr Minotte possessed firearms and that he would resort to their use if threatened,
(c) Lies told by the accused Penza to police in both recorded interviews, namely, that he had not been to Mr Minotte's house on 17 April 2006 and that he knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding his death.
(d) Flight by the accused Di Maria in the evening of 18 April 2006.
(e) The adoption of a false name and creation of false identity documents by the accused Di Maria.
(f) Flight by the accused Di Maria when stopped by police on 24 August 2007.""
100At trial, the Crown relied heavily on the evidence of the trajectory of the bullet which left marks in the kitchen area.  The Crown prosecutor said that this was the most important piece of evidence from which the jury would draw the inference that the appellants arrived at the house armed.  
101In order to understand the submissions, it is necessary to say something about the layout of the house.  The laundry was located under the house.  There were stairs which led from the back veranda to the back yard and from there one could go to the laundry door.  From the veranda if one were to go inside the house through the backdoor, one would be walking into the kitchen area.  There was no access to the laundry by an internal staircase.  The only way of gaining access to the laundry from the kitchen area was by way of the veranda down the stairs to the backyard.  Thus the laundry door was some metres away and downstairs from the back door to the house.
102The Crown theory was that one of the appellants had fired a bullet into the house from the back veranda area, that this had caused the marks referred to and that this had occurred during the same incident which ended with the shooting of the deceased.  Implicit in that theory was that the person firing from that position, already had a firearm in his possession, which was consistent with a firearm having been brought with him, and not consistent with the firearm having been obtained from the laundry after arrival.  Consistent with that theory was the finding of two spent casings which came from the same firearm.  The submission was that the firearm having been discharged from a location outside the back door, one of the appellants had then descended the stairs to the laundry and at sometime thereafter had ejected the spent casing and used the firearm to shoot the deceased and had once again ejected a casing.  That scenario also explained the evidence of neighbours that they heard two shots.
103There are, however, a number of difficulties with the Crown case.  The first is that Detective Summerfield agreed that there had been some manipulation of the back door and kitchen area, in particular moving the door so that it was almost closed, in order to get the marks to line up, to establish the path which the police said this bullet took.  It is difficult to understand why the door would have been in that position at the time the shot was fired.
104It is also difficult to understand the circumstances in which a firearm would have been discharged into the kitchen area.  Inferentially, the discharge of a firearm in that way would have had to have occurred before the shooting of the deceased.  If it were intended to shoot at or warn off the deceased, one would have expected to have found a spent casing outside the back door, either because it had been automatically ejected or if it were a bolt action or lever action weapon, because it had been manually ejected thereby allowing another round into the breech.  It seems incongruous that a person who had fired into the kitchen, would then take the firearm down the back stairs into the laundry area without preparing the weapon to fire another round.  Yet two spent casings were found in the laundry.
105Alternatively, since the back stairs provided the only direct access from the kitchen to the laundry, one might have expected the person who discharged the firearm into the kitchen to keep those stairs under observation if there were some prospect of the deceased using them to gain access to the laundry.
106There are a number of other difficulties.  Detective Sergeant O'Hagen was unable to identify the calibre of the projectile found in the kitchen.  She said it was virtually impossible to identify the position from which the bullet was fired.  Where the bullet was fired from was heavily dependent on what type of pistol or rifle was used and the type of ammunition.  No testing, expert or otherwise, was performed to ascertain the age of the gutter mark on the doorway, or the bullet mark in the wall above the stove.  No test was carried out to confirm that the gutter mark had been made by a bullet.  The projectile found on the floor of the kitchen, may have been moved from its original position during the investigation because it was not located at an early point in the crime scene investigation.  The projectile could not be ballistically linked with the two casings found in the laundry or with the projectile which killed the deceased.  Its calibre could not be determined.
107The weapon which fired the fatal shot, remained unidentified.  The two spent casings, found in the laundry, could be used in a large number of different firearms, from pistols to rifles and could be used with firearms with different types of action, e.g. automatic, lever or bolt action.  Depending on the firearm, the spent cartridges might be expelled automatically by the weapon, require manual ejection such as with a lever or bolt action, or remain in the weapon itself such as with a revolver.  It was agreed that the bullet that caused the marks in the kitchen could not have been fired from the laundry.  
108It was not possible to say from the expert evidence that the projectile which killed the deceased matched the casings found on the laundry floor.  Similarly, it was impossible to conclude that the projectile found on the kitchen floor matched the casings found on the laundry floor.  It was not possible to say that there was any match between the projectile found in the kitchen and that which killed the deceased.
109Just as with the projectile in the kitchen, the casings in the laundry may have been moved, since a number of police were in the laundry before the casings were identified.  As with the kitchen, the police initially were not aware that there had been a shooting.  Moreover, there was no examination of the surrounding houses to see if a bullet may have damaged any of their walls.  A shot fired into the air could have gone anywhere and a projectile thus fired would be almost impossible to locate. 
110There is another difficulty.  If the marks in the kitchen describe a bullet's trajectory and if the bullet that made that mark came from the same weapon which shot the deceased and if the bullet making the trajectory marks was fired on the same night, and if that was during the same incident as the deceased's death, then that scenario is contrary to the evidence of the neighbours.  The neighbours all clearly heard more than one shot, in very quick succession.  Given the layout of the house, it is simply not possible that a firearm could have been discharged into the kitchen and within a second or two, discharge so as to cause the deceased's fatal wound.
111There was, of course, a scenario readily available which would explain the discharge of a firearm towards the kitchen on an earlier occasion.  There was evidence that the deceased had been the subject of violent and threatening standover tactics by ""Lebanese guys"" who were after his money.  According to his wife, they had visited the deceased at his home on at least three occasions and demanded money.  On one occasion, his wife observed injuries which were attributed by him to a beating received from these persons.  A shot could have been fired into the kitchen by one of these persons on an earlier occasion as a warning or threat.  Clearly the deceased was living in a state of fear as evidenced by sleeping in the bathroom with the door blocked.
112There was no evidence that either of the appellants possessed a firearm before the incident.  There was no evidence of where the appellants might have obtained a firearm late at night or early in the morning of the day on which the deceased was killed.
113There is a scenario consistent with innocence, which largely fits the available evidence, particularly that of the neighbours and the recent injuries found on the deceased.  That scenario involves the appellants going to the deceased's house to acquire drugs, shouting to him so as to indicate who they were and when they received no response, opportunistically deciding to steal drugs and money from him.   While doing so, the deceased confronted them and a scuffle ensued between him and one of the appellants leading to the discharge of the firearm and the deceased's death.  This is consistent with the partially demolished state of the cavity, i.e. that the appellants were in the process of breaking into the cavity in the laundry when they were confronted by the deceased.  It is consistent with the firearm described by the deceased's wife as having been given to him by her, being similar to that described by Mr Di Maria.  This weapon could not be found when the premises were searched by the police, although a number of other weapons were discovered.
114A similar scenario consistent with innocence would have the appellants going to the deceased's house to steal drugs and money, but without a firearm.  That scenario also largely fits the available evidence.
115The one piece of evidence which does not fit that scenario is the evidence that two shots were heard by the neighbours.  It may well have occurred that the deceased fired a shot before the scuffle which led to a further discharge of the weapon and his death.  In any event, such scenarios are equally consistent with the available evidence, if not more so, than that relied upon by the Crown which also cannot account for two shots being heard in close succession.
116In summary, the evidence on this aspect of the Crown case established the following:
Bullets and cartridge cases
That the spent casings found in the laundry were fired from the same weapon.
That it was not possible to determine whether either of the bullets came from either of the casings.
That the bullet causing death was a .22 round.
That there was evidence consistent with the bullet that killed the deceased coming from the sawnoff rifle.
That with respect to the bullet inside the house, it was not possible to determine the calibre.
That the deceased was the only person known to have a sawnoff rifle in his possession.
The trajectory
Even if the marks inside the house did show a bullet's trajectory, it was not possible to estimate when that had occurred.
There was nothing that could link the trajectory to the bullet found in the kitchen area by police.
There was nothing that could link the trajectory with the gunshot that killed the deceased.
There was nothing that linked the bullet in the kitchen with the bullet that killed the deceased.
Other possibilities for the bullet in the kitchen
The deceased because of the fact that he was a drug dealer was receiving threats, had been assaulted by a group wanting to extort money from him and lived in constant fear.
A large number of people knew that he dealt drugs from his house and came during the night to purchase drugs.
117The evidence as to the distance from which the deceased was shot is equivocal.  It is equally consistent with the hypothesis put forward by the Crown and with the evidence of Mr Di Maria.  Detective Sergeant O'Hagan was of the opinion that the shot to the deceased's head was not fired from ""close"" distance, but without knowing the weapon that was used, she was not able to say whether that meant the shot was fired from more than 5, 10, 20 or even 30 cm away.
118Dr Little, the forensic pathologist, said that the bullet had fragmented on its path through the head and as it was going from left to right it was going slightly downwards.  She ventured an opinion that the weapon firing that shot could have been anything from about half a metre to one metre away.  While that evidence would tend to favour the Crown scenario, it was so extensively qualified by Dr Little as to indicate that the evidence of Detective Sergeant O'Hagan should be preferred on this issue.
119Doctor Little conceded that such an assessment should be made by a ballistics expert, although she had done some reading on the subject.  She said that the only way you could really determine exact distances for any particular weapon was to test fire it and that it depended very much upon whether it was a handgun or a rifle.  She agreed that she would defer to the opinion of a ballistics expert.  The evidence of a ballistics expert was available and should be preferred.  The evidence of Detective Sergeant O'Hagan was the only reliable expert testimony on the subject.
120The deceased was found to have a number of pink and green balloons in his oesophagus.  These contained various amounts of illegal drugs.  At least one witness gave evidence of purchasing drugs from the deceased packaged in this form.  Dr Little gave the opinion of them having been swallowed shortly before death as they had not yet moved to the stomach.  
121This is inconsistent with the deceased being surprised by the appellants.  It strongly suggests that the deceased had some minutes within which to take precautions to prevent drugs being stolen from him.  His actions in this regard are consistent with the deceased hearing noises coming from the laundry, putting a quantity of drugs out of reach, arming himself and going to investigate.  It is consistent with the evidence of Mr Di Maria and supportive of a scenario consistent with innocence.
122The evidence of the neighbours does not support the Crown scenario.  The layout of the kitchen, back veranda stairs and laundry makes it most unlikely that a shot could have been fired into the kitchen, followed almost immediately by a second shot if it were that second shot which killed the deceased.
There were two shots, probably fired very close together - Hughes, Fausett, Gaal.
Mr Pitt heard a single bang like a cap gun, followed within a ""split second"" by two more bangs.
That before the shots there was some conversation between men: Gaal, Pitt.
There was some yelling before the shots:  Gaal, Pitt.
Part of the yelling was a male calling out to someone, like calling out ""hallo"" or hailing someone inside:  Pitt.
There was a male calling out ""Come back here"" before the shots:  Gaal.
There was the sound of something that sounded like wrestling, or the sound of someone slapping on the concrete:  Pitt.
There was a gap between the sound of a person jumping over the fence and the gunshots:  Pitt.
123None of that evidence would have assisted the jury on the question of whether they could find beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants went to the house armed.  Indeed, what evidence there is tends to suggest that the appellants were calling out to someone inside and that someone later was calling for another to ""come back"".
124It is not possible to say whether the deceased had money and/or drugs, other than those he had swallowed in his possession at the time of death.  To the extent that the jury were able to reason that money and/or drugs were taken, it did not assist in the resolution of the issue of whether the appellants arrived at the house armed.  Such evidence was equivocal.  There was evidence that the cavity had been broken into and general evidence about the deceased keeping large sums of money there, together with firearms.  If, as seems likely, Mr Di Maria acquired the money for his holiday from the deceased's house, that did not assist the jury in determining whether the appellants had arrived at the house armed.
125The second area of evidence relied upon by the Crown does not greatly advance the Crown case.  Although there is no evidence that Mr Penza told Mr Di Maria that the deceased possessed firearms and that he would resort to their use if threatened, an inference that he had done so could reasonably be drawn by the jury.  That having been said, it does not necessarily follow as a matter of logical inference, that the appellants would arm themselves before going to his house.  This is particularly so when there was no evidence that either one of them owned a firearm or had access to firearms.
126There is an equally available inference that because of their fear of him they would go to the deceased's house in order to ascertain whether he was at home and if not, look for drugs and money.  Although there was some evidence that relations between Mr Penza and the deceased had not been good in the months leading up to his death, there is no evidence of such a breakdown in relations as would lead Mr Penza to threaten the life of the deceased.
127Some support for the latter scenario, i.e. one consistent with innocence, emerges from the first ERISP completed by Mr Penza on 18 April 2006.  
""Q.107 Okay and how often, how would he sell it, would he leave the house or would people come to him or --A. He would leave the house and then he would have people go to the house.
Q.108 Okay and when he left the house, what, would he get in his car, or would he walk or what would he do?A.  Car.
...
Q.121 All right ... when he went out selling drugs would he go out by himself or would he go out with others?A.  Yeah by himself.
Q.122 Do you know where he would usually deal his drugs to?A.   From here to Bexley.
Q. 123 Yeah just to Bexley?A.  All over like yeah furthest he goes is Bexley.""
128These responses by Mr Penza ought be given considerable weight.  They were made at a time when he was not charged, before any trial was envisaged against him and before he had instructed counsel.  In those circumstances, his statement that he was aware that the deceased would go out at night could not be seen as a ruse by him to try to falsely prove that the deceased may not have been at the house when they arrived.  It is unlikely that this statement is an early attempt by Mr Penza to corroborate the defence which would be maintained by the appellants at trial.
129The last four areas of evidence raise the same issue and suffer from the same difficulty.  In the case of Mr Penza, the Crown submitted that the lies told by him in both his recorded interviews - that he had not been to the deceased's house on 17 April 2006 and that he knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding his death, were evidence of a consciousness of guilt and therefore were capable of proving that he and Mr Di Maria went to the deceased's house armed.
130It was common ground that Mr Penza had told lies to the police in his ERISPs in relation to those matters.  The lies were clearly intended to separate him from the scene of the incident.  Mr Penza had also told lies to Messrs Amil and Clarke as to his movements on that night.  He told Mr Amil that he had not been at the deceased's house that night and he told Mr Clarke that he was at his girlfriend's that night.
131In the context of a defence case which conceded that Mr Penza had formed an intention to steal from the deceased, and where he knew that the deceased had been shot in the course of a struggle with Mr Di Maria, there is a ready explanation for the lies that does not go to consciousness of guilt with respect to murder.  As his counsel put to the jury, he knew that he had done the wrong thing, when attempting to steal from his stepfather, and thereby causing his death.  This was a plausible alternative explanation for the lies.  In addition, there was evidence of a real basis for him to fear other family members.  This provided a continuing reason why he did not simply admit that he had gone there with Mr Di Maria to steal from the deceased.  
132The same submission is available in relation to the grazes and marks on his arms.  He told Mr Clarke that these had been caused when he was trying to fix Phillip Minotte's car.  Such marks as were described by Mr Clarke were also consistent with trying to break open the brickwork, concealing the wall cavity and with his blood which was found in the laundry.  It was an available and plausible inference that Mr Penza was trying to hide his involvement with the plan to steal and the ultimate death of the deceased.  That lie and the other lies did not compel a conclusion that if he told the truth, he would necessarily be admitting to murder.
133Leaving aside the question of the admissibility of the evidence as to lies (which forms the basis of another ground of appeal), its probative value was at best slight.  It certainly was consistent with a consciousness of guilt but a consciousness of guilt of a different offence, i.e., the actual or attempted robbery of the deceased and an involvement in his death, but not necessarily an involvement amounting to the offence of murder.  It was, of course, also consistent with a consciousness of guilt for the offence of murder.  The difficulty for the Crown is that there was nothing in the evidence concerning the lies which rendered this evidence more consistent with the Crown case of murder than with the defence hypothesis that they were engaged in the theft of money and drugs when as a result of series of unfortunate events, the deceased died.
134The same considerations apply to the evidence of flight in relation to Mr Di Maria.  The matters relied upon against him as indicating a consciousness of guilt were his departure for Malaysia on 18 April 2006, the adoption of a false name and the creation of a false identity when returning to Australia and his flight when stopped by police on 24 August 2007 after his return to Australia.
135The evidence of Mr Di Maria was that the motivation for his flight and other actions was a fear of retribution from members of the deceased's family, in particular the son Phillip.
136Those areas of evidence ((d), (e) and (f) in her Honour's written direction) are not capable of discerning between the existence of a consciousness of guilt, which might reasonably follow from the events described by Mr Di Maria (an attempted drug theft gone wrong, culminating in the death of the deceased following a struggle and the involuntary discharge of the firearm) or the scenario contended for by the Crown (a deliberate shooting of the deceased or felony murder).  There is no rational basis upon which the jury could have been satisfied that one scenario was to be preferred to the other.  Alternatively, (and this relates to Ground of Appeal 3), the evidence was not capable of discerning between a consciousness of guilt that might arise following the commission of murder as distinct from a consciousness of guilt that might follow upon liability for manslaughter.
137The appellants submitted that on this state of the evidence, the jury had no proper basis for preferring the scenario put forward by the Crown rather than that available to the defence since the evidence itself did not favour one over the other.  The appellants relied upon the following statements of principle:
""We accept that there may be some circumstances in which post-offence conduct is equally consistent with two or more possible offences or is otherwise intractably neutral.  Where that is so, it may not be open, even on the totality of the evidence, to draw an inference that the accused had a consciousness of guilt of some particular conduct at the time that he told lies or performed some act which the prosecution relies upon as constituting post-offence conduct.""  (R v Ciantar [2006] 16 VR 26 at [40] (Warren CJ, Chernov,Nettle, Neave and Redlich JJA)
138Martinez v WA [2007] A Crim R 389, a decision of the Western Australia Court of Appeal (Martin CJ; Steytler P and Miller JA) adopted that statement of principle in Ciantar:
""As we have said, the potential probative force of an Edwards lie rests in its potential to amount to an implied admission of guilt.  It can consequently never be intractably neutral in its effect, in the sense in which the phrase is used in the corroboration context, because it goes to the ultimate issue of guilt.  Accordingly, where the phrase is used in this context, it really means no more than that the lie is incapable of amounting to an implied admission of guilt because there is an innocent explanation for it that is just as likely as the inference of guilt which might be drawn from the lie.""
139Those statements of principle appear to develop what was said by the plurality (Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ) in Edwards v R  [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193 at 212:
""Whilst in many cases it may be a question for the jury whether a lie was told because the truth was perceived to be inconsistent with innocence or for some other reason, if it was established that there was a deliberate lie in this case about a material matter ...  The innocent explanation for that lie was so plausible that the lie could not have been probative of guilt.  Quite apart from our concerns about the existence of the lie and its materiality, this should have prevented the trial judge from concluding that the telling of the lie was capable of amounting to corroboration of the complainant's evidence.""
140I accept the submission of the appellants that the evidence as to the lies told by Mr Penza and the flight and attempts to avoid recognition by the police on the part of Mr Di Maria, were not capable of rationally affecting the assessment of the probability of the crucial fact in issue in these proceedings, i.e. whether the appellants were armed when they went to the deceased's house.  This is because the evidence was not able to differentiate in any meaningful way between the scenario put forward by the Crown and the equally plausible scenario relied on by the appellants.
141Such an approach is consistent with the observation by the plurality (Brennan, Dawson and Gaudron JJ) in Griffiths v R  [1994] HCA 55; 69 ALJR 77.  In a case involving a possible accidental shooting, the plurality said:
""In the present case, on the view of the evidence adopted by themajority, two schoolboys, best friends without any evidence ofhostility between them, were out in the mountains together with a gun; the gun went off and killed one boy and the other went away and tried to lay a false trail about the incident but, when acknowledging that he shot and killed the other, said it was an accident. On that evidence, the possibility that the death was due to ""accident"" - stumbling when the gun was cocked and loaded or some other kind of accident - was clearly raised. Evidence that the appellant gave false or different stories about his contacts with John Apps did not disprove that John's death was caused by ""accident"". Indeed, it is arguable that that evidence did not tend to disprove accident. The burden of disproof that rested on the Crown was substantial, not merely formal. ...""
142The test to be applied in considering whether a verdict is unreasonable for the purpose of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act is well known.  It was laid down by the majority of the High Court in M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 in the following terms at 493:
""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidenceto sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to concludethat the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which thecourt must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of theevidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonabledoubt that the accused was guilty.  But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.""
And (at 494 - 495):
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence . In doing so, the court is not substituting trialby a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question mustalways be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" 
143That test has been affirmed by the High Court as the appropriate test to apply in a number of cases:  MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [25], [45].  In SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Keifel JJ) said:
""11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:
""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".
12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""
13 The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""
Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter.
14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:
""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""""
144Applying those statements of principle to the evidence in this matter, leads me to conclude that the verdict of guilty was unreasonable in respect of the appellants and cannot be supported by the evidence.
145None of the matters identified by the Crown compelled a finding that either appellant was armed before arriving at the deceased's house.  There was no evidence of when the shot fired in the house occurred.  On the Crown case, the shot must have been fired through the backdoor and then some time later, the fatal shot fired downstairs near the laundry.  This not only does not explain how both spent casings ended up actually inside the laundry, but it does not help a jury understand how the sequence of events must have transpired and it is inconsistent with the evidence from the neighbours.
146For the Crown case to be correct, there must have been some discernible break between the shots fired.  However, the evidence from the neighbours is unanimous on this point.  All of them describe shots fired in rapid succession.  There was no appreciable time gap between the shots.  It would not have been possible, let alone plausible, for one of the appellants to have fired a shot through the back of the house and then almost immediately fired a fatal shot at the deceased, some metres away, downstairs, near or inside the laundry.
147On the other hand, there is a body of evidence which supports the proposition that the appellants were, at least initially, trying to buy drugs from the deceased when they thought he was home and it was only after they satisfied themselves that he was not at home that they had the courage to attempt to steal from him.  Alternatively, if they had from the beginning formed the intention of stealing drugs and money from the deceased, they did so on the basis that they would only attempt the theft if they could ascertain that he was not at home.
148The appellants had certainly done what they could in relation to making a noise to rouse whomever might be in the house.  The above alternatives provide the only reasonable explanation for the noise noted by the neighbours.  If the intention were to attend the premises armed and to overpower or dominate the deceased, why wake him?  If that were the plan, why be so loud as to wake the neighbours?  Why make the noise from the property next door where other members of the family lived, thereby risking waking people who could not only assist the deceased if needed, but might also identify the appellants.
149It needs to be remembered that before convicting the appellants, the jury had to be satisfied that there was a plan to rob the deceased while armed and that they contemplated the real possibility that as a consequence of the plan, the deceased might be shot.  Alternatively, the jury had to be satisfied that the appellants arrived at the house armed with a firearm intending to commit one of the specified felonies.  There was no evidence, direct or indirect, which would allow the jury to be satisfied as to those matters.
150Apart from the evidence of Mr Di Maria, there was no direct evidence of any plan at all.  So far as the Crown's circumstantial case is concerned, there was no evidence that supports the proposition that the appellants must have gone to the deceased's house to rob him, rather than to purchase drugs.  To the extent that there is any evidence, it supports the latter scenario.
People often came in the late night, or early morning to purchase drugs from the deceased.
The deceased sold to a large number of people he knew, including family members.
The appellants were looking to continue the party.
The evidence from the neighbours supports loud voices calling out, or ""hailing the deceased"" before any evidence of a struggle.
People needed to call out to the deceased before he would come and sell them drugs.
151The evidence supports the proposition that the appellants were checking to see if the deceased was home.
The calling out went on for some time, suggesting that they wanted to be sure, if he were inside, that he heard them.
They called out from the property next door where members of the deceased's family continued to live.
They had knocked already and called out with no answer.
The deceased did go out regularly to do drop-offs.
152None of the evidence compels a conclusion that to the extent that there was a plan, it involved anything more than stealing.  There was no evidence that the appellants had a firearm, let alone a .22 calibre weapon, or had access to such a weapon that may have fired the fatal shot.  Given the fairly detailed evidence of their whereabouts during most of the previous day, neither of them had much opportunity to obtain a weapon from another place.  There was no evidence from people who associated with them that either appellant had ever been seen in possession of a firearm of any kind, let alone a .22 sawnoff rifle, if that in fact were the weapon which fired the shot.  The deceased was only person who was known to have access to firearms.
153As indicated, I am satisfied that this ground of appeal should succeed.  The consequence of success on a ground of appeal so framed is the quashing of the conviction and the entry of a verdict of acquittal.  That conclusion renders it unnecessary to resolve the remaining grounds of appeal.  However, in deference to the detailed arguments which were put in relation to the other grounds of appeal, I propose to deal briefly with them.
Ground of Appeal 2:  The learned trial judge erred by failing to direct the jury that, in respect of felony murder, the act causing the death had to be voluntary.
154Although the parties placed emphasis on the antecedent issue of whether the accused came to the deceased's home armed, the appellants submitted that the evidence of Mr Di Maria also clearly raised the possibility of death being caused by an involuntary discharge of the firearm.  They submitted that there was an issue as to whether the act causing death (i.e. the discharge of the firearm) was in fact a voluntary act of the relevant appellant.  They submitted that the issue arose in circumstances where the only evidence of the precise circumstance of the shooting was given by Mr Di Maria, i.e. the Crown was unable to adduce evidence about the precise circumstances in which the deceased came to be shot.
155The appellants accepted that the issue did not arise in relation to the extended joint criminal enterprise case because the jury was directed that to find the appellants guilty on that basis, it had to be satisfied that one of the appellants ""deliberately discharged the firearm at Mr Minotte, intending to kill him or intending to cause really serious injury"".
156The appellants submitted that the issue did arise in relation to the felony murder case.  They submitted that the act or omission causing death in a felony murder must be a voluntary act.  They submitted that where the evidence raised voluntariness as an issue, the trial judge was obliged to put the issue properly to the jury.
157The appellants submitted that the trial judge was required to do three things:
Direct the jury that it had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act causing death was a voluntary or willed act of the accused.
Explain that identification of the act causing death was a question of fact for the jury.
Explain these concepts to the jury and identify the evidence that was relevant to the issue so that the direction might be given proper effect by the jury.
158To support this proposition, the appellants relied upon Ryan v R [1967] HCA 2; 121 CLR 205.  The facts of Ryan involved the accused entering a service station and demanding money while pointing a loaded and cocked sawnoff rifle at the attendant, without the safety catch applied.  While still pointing the rifle with one hand, he attempted to tie the attendant up with his other hand.  On the attendant's sudden movement, the accused's finger pressed the trigger without, according to the accused, ""intention on his part"".  The attendant was killed instantly.  The accused's defence to the charge that he murdered the attendant was that the killing, being criminal but accidental, was manslaughter.
159At pp 216 - 218 Barwick CJ said:
""In my opinion, the authorities establish, and it is consonant with principle, that an accused is not guilty of a crime if the deed which would constitute it was not done in exercise of his will to act. ...  If voluntariness is not conceded and the material to be submitted to the jury wheresoever derived provides a substantial basis for doubting whether the deed in question was a voluntary or willed act of the accused, the jury's attention must be specifically drawn to the necessity of deciding beyond all reasonable doubt that the deed charged as a crime was the voluntary or willed act of the accused. If it was not then for that reason, there being no defence of insanity, the accused must be acquitted. No doubt care will be taken by the presiding judge that the available material warrants the raising of this specific issue. In doing so, he will of course have in mind that the question for him is whether upon that material a jury would be entitled to entertain a reasonable doubt as to the voluntary quality of the act attributed to the accused. Also, the presiding judge where the circumstances of the case are like those of the instant case, will explain the difference between the third and fourth views (ante) so that the jury are given to understand the precise question to which they have relevantly to address themselves. Although a claim of involuntariness is no doubt easily raised, and may involve nice distinctions, the accused, if the material adduced warrants that course, is entitled to have the issue properly put to the jury.
In outlining the facts of this case, I have indicated that the material provided by the statement made by the accused by virtue of the right given him by s. 496 of the Crimes Act, and the evidence of the police officers would have been sufficient to call for consideration whether the act causing death, if it was the discharge of the gun, was the act of the applicant and to entitle the jury at least to remain in doubt whether that discharge was willed by the applicant and voluntary. 
I have said that these consequences followed, if the jury thought the discharge of the gun was the cause of death. That means that it would have been necessary, in my opinion, for the jury to have determined to their satisfaction what was the act which caused the death charged. Ordinarily, the identification of the act causing death gives no difficulty, a circumstance which may tend to obscure the logical and practical necessity to isolate that act, for it is of it, and it alone, that one or more of the several specified conditions or concomitants must be predicated if the terms of s 18 are to be satisfied.""
(The reference in the above quotation to the ""third and fourth views"", is a reference to a voluntary but unintentional act, as opposed to an involuntary or unwilled act discussed in the judgment at p 209.)
160The appellants noted that this statement of principle was approved by the plurality (Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Royall v The Queen [1991] HCA 27; 172 CLR 378 at 385 where Mason CJ said:
""It is convenient to deal initially with the question of causation. The applicant submits that neither the trial judge nor the Court of Criminal Appeal defined adequately the act done by the applicant which was alleged to have caused the death of the deceased, thereby creating difficulties in determining the issues of causation and intent, in particular the coincidence of act and intent. Ordinarily there is no occasion for a trial judge to spend much time on the identification of the act causing death, but there is a ""logical and practical necessity to isolate that act, for it is of it, and it alone, that one or more of the several specified conditions or concomitants must be predicated if the terms of s18 are to be satisfied"", to repeat the words of Barwick C.J. in Ryan v The Queen. In Ryan the trial judge's directions were deficient in that they failed to isolate the particular act or acts which the jury might identify as the cause of death. In that case there was room for argument about what was the act which caused death. Different considerations arose for determination in ascertaining whether Ryan's state of mind satisfied the requirements of s 18, depending upon which act was identified as the cause of death. The Crown case was that Ryan went to rob a service station. While he had his finger on the trigger of a loaded, cocked gun pointed at the deceased's back, with his other hand he tried to find a cord in his pocket. The deceased made a sudden movement, Ryan stepped back and the gun discharged, killing the deceased. If pressing the trigger was identified as the act causing death, the question was whether Ryan willed that act and intended to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm or whether it was an unwilled reflex movement. If, however, presentation of the gun was identified as the act causing death, the question was whether Ryan knew that in the circumstances the involuntary discharge of the gun was probable.  ...
In Ryan, the Chief Justice pointed out that ""the choice of the act causing death is not for the presiding judge or for the Court of Criminal Appeal: it is essentially a matter for the jury under proper direction"". So the question on this aspect of the present case is whether the trial judge adequately directed the jury as to the particular acts any one of which they might regard as the cause of the deceased's death. In this respect there was, in my view, just as there was in Ryan, a need for the trial judge to give specific and close attention to the identification of the various acts which, on the Crown case, might have been the cause of death. It is not to the point to say that in the present case the requirement of intent under s18 was the same, no matter which of the acts identified by the Crown was selected by the jury as the cause of death. The point is that, in ascertaining whether there was the requisite intent, different matters may need to be taken into account, depending upon which act is identified as the act which caused death."" 
161The appellants also relied on Murray v R [2002] HCA 26; 211 CLR 193, although they accepted that the result of that case depended upon the relevantly different Queensland statutory provision.  Nevertheless, the majority affirmed the obligation of the trial judge to give careful directions on voluntariness and causality:
""13 ... Although it is accurate to speak in murder cases of the ""act"" referred to in s 23(1)(a) as the ""act causing death"", it is for the jury to determine what act or acts were done by the accused and whether they or any of them caused death. Thus, in Ryan, Barwick CJ expressed the view that, on the facts of that case, ""the jury could choose the presentation of the gun in the circumstances [in which it was presented] or its subsequent discharge as the act causing death."" And on the view that the act causing death was the discharge of the gun, his Honour allowed that there were at least four possibilities, namely: 
1  voluntary discharge with the intention of harming the deceased; 2  voluntary discharge with the intention only of frightening the deceased; 3  voluntary discharge in panic with no specific intention either to do harm or to frighten the deceased; 4  discharge by the pressing of the trigger in a reflex, convulsive movement.
His Honour expressed the view, in relation to the fourth of those possibilities, that the accused's description of the killing as an ""accident"" was inconsistent with an admission that the gun was voluntarily discharged.
14 Subject to two matters which will be dealt with shortly, I think the analysis by Barwick CJ in Ryan is legally and logically correct and that that analysis is applicable in this case. The first, as has already been noted, is that Ryan was concerned with a charge of murder under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). At the relevant time, s 18(1) of that Act defined murder to include an act causing death that was done with reckless indifference to human life or done in an attempt to commit or during or immediately after the commission of an act obviously dangerous to human life. Thus, the act causing death could be identified by Taylor and Owen JJ as ""the presentation of the [loaded and cocked] rifle ... with the finger of the [accused] on the trigger in circumstances in which an attempt at resistance might well have been expected"". (Gaudron J)
...
89 I agree with Gaudron J that the identification of what was the relevant ""act"" and whether it was willed or not were questions for the jury. They were not questions of law for the judge. Even if the final ""act"" was a reflex action, it only took on its fatal character because of earlier acts of the appellant dangerous to human life. Thus, I agree with Gaudron J that if the jury came to the conclusion that the ultimate ""act"" that led to the depression of the trigger of the loaded gun pointed at the deceased could be described as a ""reflex"" act, it was still a question for the jury whether that act was properly to be viewed as having occurred ""independently of the exercise of the [appellant's] will.""  (Kirby J)
...
148 There will, obviously, be difficulty from time to time in identifying, for the purposes of s 23(1)(a), the relevant act. Equally, from time to time there will be difficulty in determining whether the evidence provides a sufficient basis for a direction as to either limb of s 23(1).  But such difficulties do not relieve a trial judge from the necessity of so directing, when required, and, as to the first of them, of identifying, that is to say, effectively isolating what on the evidence is capable of being regarded as the act causing death and as the unwilled act.  Everything that has relevantly occurred before it, including the earlier relations between the victim and the accused, and the latter's acts in placing himself in such a position as to give the ""act"" the capacity to inflict harm, will have much to say about its true nature, that is, whether it was willed or not, but those earlier acts will generally not constitute the ""act"" itself, or be a constituent part of it. It will be, however, for the jury so instructed, in reaching their verdict of guilty or not guilty, to determine whether in fact the prosecutor has negatived that the death resulted from an unwilled act (or accident).""  (Callinan J)
162The appellants submitted that in the context of this trial, those obligations on the part of the trial judge, subsisted irrespective of whether or not one of the appellants came to the house armed.  This was because identification of the act causing death was a matter for the jury, properly instructed, to determine.  They submitted that it was not without significance that in Ryan, Barwick CJ had reasoned that attending the crime scene with a firearm was too remote to form part of the act causing death.
""Whilst, of course, all that happenings of the evening antecedent to the discharge of the gun might be regarded for the purpose of deciding whether some act of the applicant which caused the death of the deceased qualified under one or more of the conditions of culpability for murder which are set out in s 18, they could not, in my opinion, be regarded in the aggregate as the act of the accused causing death.  Such a course, in my opinion, not merely lacks the requisite precision but fails to provide a subject of which one or more of the said conditions or concomitants could be predicated.  The earliest act of the applicant which, in my opinion, could have been selected by the jury as the act causing death was the presentation of the gun towards the back of the deceased after, at the applicant's bidding, he had turned around to enable his hands to be tied behind him.  Thus at the most, the jury could choose the presentation of the gun in the circumstances or its subsequent discharge as the act causing death.  For my part, I would think the latter might well have been the obvious choice when the difficulties which would arise in connection with the former, if the jury accepted the fourth view of the facts to which I earlier referred, are considered.""  (p 218)
163The appellants submitted that the directions given by the trial judge omitted to put the issue of voluntariness to the jury.  The appellants articulated their criticism of the directions given by the trial judge on this point as follows.
164In relation to the felony murder case, the jury was not directed that it had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act causing death was a voluntary or willed act of the accused.  The jury was not told that identification of the act causing death was a question of fact for its own determination.  These concepts were not explained to the jury, nor was the evidence relevant to the issue summed up for the jury's consideration.  The directions given on felony murder tended to convey the opposite impression to what the law required.  As the jury was directed, felony murder was established irrespective of how the weapon came to be discharged and regardless of whether the firing of the weapon was a ""deliberate act"".
165The jury was directed in writing as to the elements of the felony murder case in MFI 19 as follows:
""1. The accused each agreed to carry out an armed robbery in company on Mr Minotte, or they each agreed to break enter and steal, in company, from Mr Minotte's home while one of them was armed with a firearm;
2. That the offence was committed or there was an attempt to commit that offence;
3. During the course of committing the offence, or immediately after its commission, one of the accused discharged the firearm, causing Mr Minotte's death, and
4. The discharge of the firearm during the commission of the offence was a contingency (or possible happening) which the other accused had in mind, whether or not the gun was fired deliberately and whether or not the gun was discharged for the purposes of the joint criminal enterprise.""
166These directions were repeated in the summing up when it came to element (4) of the written direction.  The trial judge said (at SU 41):
""... and 4, that the discharge of the firearm during the commission of the offence was a contingency or a possibility - contingency does not mean much more than possibility - that the other accused had in mind whether or not the gun was fired deliberately, and whether or not the gun was discharged for the purposes of the agreement.
So that is where felony murder differs quite markedly from the extended joint criminal enterprise.  Once you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused were in fact committing a felony, and the gun was discharged in the course of committing that felony, and the death of Mr Minotte results, it does not matter how the gun was discharged.  Because the law takes the view that if you are in the process of committing a very serious offence and a death results, you should be liable for the consequences of the discharge of the gun.""
167These directions took the issue of voluntariness away from the jury's consideration.  In that sense, they were wrong in law and gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.  The jury would have been required to convict the appellant for murder on these directions, even had it formed the conclusion that death was caused by circumstances that did not involve a voluntary or willed act of the appellant (e.g. the gun discharged involuntarily during a struggle with the deceased).  This deprived the evidence of Mr Di Maria concerning the circumstances of the struggle and the fatal shot of any efficacy and thereby deprived him of an opportunity of being acquitted of murder.  
Ground 3:  The learned trial judge erred by failing to leave manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act for the jury's consideration.
168Manslaughter due to intoxication was left to the jury, but only as an alternative verdict to murder on the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise liability.  The jury was directed that there could be no alternative verdict of manslaughter in respect of the felony murder case (SU 41).  An alternative verdict of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act was not left for the jury's consideration.  The appellants submitted that this was an error of law and that the trial miscarried for this reason.  It is common ground that the trial judge was not asked to leave manslaughter to the jury.
169The appellants relied upon the summary of principle by Beazley JA (with whom James and Hall JJ agreed) in Blackwell v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 93; 208 A Crim 5 392:
""49 The overriding requirement of the criminal justice system is that an accused person have a fair trial according to law. If there has not been a fair trial there will have been a miscarriage of justice. A fair trial includes the entitlement of an accused person to have the jury directed in accordance with law: see Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107 per Barwick CJ, at 117. As Barwick CJ explained, this involves directing the jury as to the facts which might lead to an alternate available outcome other than the specific offence charged. Subject to the application of the proviso, an accused person who has not had a fair trial will be entitled to have a conviction set aside.
50 The question as to whether there has been a miscarriage of justice has been considered in circumstances where an alternative count should have been but was not left to the jury. Whether or not there has been a miscarriage of justice depends upon whether the appellate court is satisfied that a jury properly instructed, including on the alternative charge, would necessarily have returned a verdict on the principal charge: see Gilbert v R [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 and Gillard v R [2003] HCA 64; 219 CLR 1.
51 In Gilbert the appellant was charged with murder. However, the jury was erroneously instructed that there was no possibility that the appellant could be found guilty of manslaughter. The jury convicted the appellant of murder. On appeal to the High Court, the Crown submitted that as the jury had been correctly directed in respect of the elements of murder, the verdict demonstrated that they were satisfied of all the elements of murder, including the higher state of knowledge required for murder, as opposed to manslaughter: see R v Evans and Lewis [1969] VR 858 at 871. This proposition was rejected. Gleeson CJ and Gummow J, at [19], adopted the following statement of principle by Lord Tucker in Bullard v The Queen [1957] AC 635 at 644: 

""Every man on trial for murder has the right to have the issue of manslaughter left to the jury if there is any evidence upon which such a verdict can be given. To deprive him of this right must of necessity constitute a grave miscarriage of justice and it is idle to speculate what verdict the jury would have reached."" ""
170The appellants submitted that the evidence of Mr Di Maria was that the appellants did not come to the house of the deceased armed.  He also gave evidence that the deceased was shot either involuntarily or at the least, without intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm in the course of a struggle over the firearm.  They submitted that there was other evidence in the trial which supported this evidence.  They submitted that in those circumstances, the trial judge was obliged to leave manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act for the jury's consideration.
171The appellants submitted that the jury should have been left with a choice that a verdict of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act could be returned on the basis that the appellants agreed to commit a break and enter (simpliciter) offence and that one of them armed himself at the scene immediately before the shooting.  Alternatively, they submitted, manslaughter was available on the basis identified by the Crown prosecutor during an exchange with the trial judge:
""... Only one of the two offenders did the shooting.  If the other didn't contemplate the possibility of a shooting within intent to cause serious bodily harm, but did consider the possibility of some other lesser injury, then manslaughter could arise.""  (T.678)
172The appellants submitted that leaving manslaughter on this latter basis was considered in Gillard v R [2003] HCA 64; 219 CLR 1 (Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at [29], Gummow J at [32], Kirby at [74] ff, Hayne J at [106] and [125] ff).
173The appellants submitted that both limbs of the prosecution case were apt to raise the question of their liability for manslaughter.  Manslaughter was likely to arise in a case involving extended joint criminal enterprise murder, because of the possibility that an accused would lack the necessary foresight as to the intended consequences of the act causing death (Gillard v R).  In respect of felony murder, liability for manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act would potentially arise where there was an issue concerning the nature of the foundational offence - in particular, whether it was an offence punishable by imprisonment for life or 25 years or some lesser offence.  
174The reason why manslaughter was not left to the jury is tolerably clear.  On the appellants' case at trial, they were somewhat opportunistically attempting to steal drugs and money when they were confronted by the deceased, who was armed, and who attempted to shoot Mr Di Maria before a struggle ensued.  On Mr Di Maria's evidence, his actions were in self-defence and reasonable.
175As the submissions by the appellants make clear, however, the scenario described by Mr Di Maria was not the only one available on the evidence.  There were variations of that scenario and to that put forward by the Crown, which were consistent with manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act.  The most obvious of those was if the jury were satisfied that the appellants had armed themselves before going to the deceased's house but was not satisfied that the ""act"" which led to the deceased's death was done with one of the requisite intents for murder.
176As the authorities make clear, just because the jury entered a verdict of guilty on the murder charge, does not mean that if properly instructed on manslaughter, they would have necessarily returned the same verdict.  In Blackwell Beazley JA said:
""83 The evidence in relation to intoxication and the impulsivity of the appellant's behaviour raised an issue as to the nature of the appellant's intention. The jury's question to the judge reveals that it was actively concerned about that issue. In my opinion, it cannot be said that on the evidence, notwithstanding the error in respect of the alternative count, the appellant must have been convicted on the s 33 count. This was a matter where it was open to the jury to convict on an alternative count of reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm. It is an exemplar of Callinan J's observation in Gilbert, namely, that where there is choice of decisions to be made, the choice actually made will be affected by the choices offered.""
177I am satisfied that this ground of appeal has been made out.  For the reasons set out in the appellants' submissions, there was a proper basis for manslaughter to be left to the jury.
Rule 4
178The success of this Ground of Appeal and Ground of Appeal 2, gives rise to the question of whether the appellants should be entitled to rely upon these grounds, when no objection was taken at trial.
179Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules provides as follows:
""No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.""180Defence counsel at trial did not ask for a direction as to voluntariness in relation to felony murder and specifically eschewed any direction as to manslaughter.  Accordingly, I am of the opinion that leave is required.  Leave to rely on an error to which no objection was taken at trial will be granted where the appellant can demonstrate that the error led to a miscarriage of justice (R v Abusafiah [1991] NSWCCA 542; 21 NSWLR 531 at 536; R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20; 62 NSWLR 346 at [20]; R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385; 64 NSWLR 527 at [99]).
181I have concluded that as the jury were not instructed in respect of felony murder that the act causing death had to be voluntary, and as to the availability of the alternative verdict of manslaughter, this may have caused each appellant to lose a real chance (or a chance fairly open to him) of being found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter (R v Kanaan at [101]).  The fact that there was an obligation on the trial judge to give such direction (Pemble v The Queen) is further support for the grant of leave.
182As was said by the Court in Carney v R; Cambey v R [2011] NSWCCA 223 (Whealy JA; James and Hoeben JJ):
""69 It has been said that the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on the basis of one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which he could and should have raised at the first trial ( Darwiche at [170]). We would not wish to undermine this proposition. Where, however, the failure to leave the alternative verdict of manslaughter may have caused an accused to lose a real chance of being found not guilty of murder but guilty of the alternative charge, this places the case in a different category. We recognise that, as was probably the case here, the appellants' counsel may have been reluctant, as a matter of tactics, to see manslaughter left. But directions could have been framed by the trial judge so that it was left as an alternative verdict without unduly prejudicing the appellants in the case each wished to make. We have little doubt that had her Honour been asked to leave manslaughter, she would have done so, and that she would have crafted directions carefully to avoid any prejudice to the case presented by the appellants.""
183It follows that I consider that this is an appropriate case for leave to be granted to allow the appellants to pursue Grounds of Appeal 2 and 3.
Ground of Appeal 4(a):  The evidence relied on by the Crown to establish consciousness of guilt on the part of the appellants was inadmissible.Ground of Appeal 4(b):  The learned trial judge erred by directing the jury that they could engage in consciousness of guilt reasoning in relation to the appellants.
184When considering this ground of appeal, it needs to be kept in mind that the evidence of the lies told by Mr Penza and of flight and attempts to avoid apprehension by Mr Di Maria, was admitted without objection.  It should also be noted that although defence counsel had opened to the jury as to what their cases would be, this evidence was adduced before Mr Di Maria gave his evidence.
185The appellants submitted, by reference to the statements of principle in R v Ciantar, Martinez v WA and Edwards v The Queen previously set out ([137] - [139]), that the evidence of consciousness of guilt relied on against the appellants was not admissible because it was not capable of distinguishing between a consciousness of guilt which might reasonably follow from the murder of the deceased and that which might follow from the scenario described by Mr Di Maria, i.e. an attempted drug theft culminating in the death of the deceased.  The appellants submitted that the evidence was inadmissible because it was not relevant in the sense that it was not capable of rationally affecting the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue in the proceedings.
186Alternatively, the appellants submitted that the evidence should have been subject to a discretionary exclusion on the basis that its potential prejudicial effect (due to the risk of the evidence being given undue weight) far outweighed its very slight probative value - s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995.
187In order to assess this ground of appeal, it is necessary to set out the trial judge's directions as to consciousness of guilt.  Her Honour said:
""It is not disputed that Mr Di Maria left the country rather precipitously on 18 April and it is not disputed that he adopted a false name and returned to the country under that false name and had certain documents that were in false names.  And it is not disputed that he ran from the police when they stopped him on 24 August 2007.  So none of those things are disputed.  The real dispute is whether those items of evidence in combination lead to that one conclusion.
Now, let me just say something about items (c), (d), (e) and (f).  You will see that the Crown relies upon the fact that Mr Penza told lies in his interview with the police and the Crown relies on the circumstances surrounding Mr Di Maria's departure from Australia which in law we call ""evidence of flight"".
Now there are some further directions that I must give you about those particulars items of evidence and I am referring to (c), (d), (e) and (f).  They fall into the category of what the law calls ""consciousness of guilt"".  In other words the Crown says that the accused each behaved in the way they did because they knew that they had gone to number 24, armed with a firearm, and that they had killed Mr Minotte.  That is, they did those things out of a consciousness of guilt.
Now Mr Penza's lies to the police specifically that he did not go to the deceased's house on 17 April and he knew nothing about his death and Mr Di Maria's flight from Australia and his return under a false name with a false identity document and his attempt to run from the police when he was arrested, the Crown said they were all motivated by that consciousness of guilt.  But, before you could use that evidence in support of the inference the Crown asks you to draw, you have to be satisfied of the following things:
Firstly, that the conduct was deliberate.  It has not been suggested to you that the lies were not deliberate or that Mr Di Maria's flight from Australia was not deliberate.  So that will not I suggest unduly trouble you.  
Secondly, that the conduct relates to an issue that is material or relevant to the offence charged and again it is not suggested to you that Mr Penza's lies or Mr Di Maria's flight is not related to a relevant issue in the proceedings.
Thirdly, that the conduct reveals a knowledge of the offence or some aspect of it and that is not disputed either.  Indeed, both of the accused accepted that their conduct was in effect related to or revealed a knowledge by them of the fact that Mr Minotte had died, not that of course that they had necessarily been there armed but certainly it reveals a knowledge of the fact that Mr Minotte had died in circumstances that connected them to the death.
And lastly you have to be satisfied that the lie was told by Mr Penza and that Mr Di Maria fled the country because of them knew that the truth of the matter would implicate him in the commission of the offence or, to put it another way, because of a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth, and this last matter is the matter that is really in dispute, as it were, when it comes to your use of lies or flight for the purposes of drawing this inference.
I emphasise that you must be satisfied that what was in the mind of each of the accused was guilt of the offence charged - that is, guilt of the offence of murder and not some other crime.  It is not just a question of them feeling guilty over the circumstances in which Mr Minotte died if, for example, that death was occasioned by some accidental discharge of the gun.  That is not the kind of consciousness of guilt that we are talking about.  It has to be guilt of the offence of a murder and not some other offence.
You must remember that people do not always act rationally and that conduct of this sort might sometimes be explained in other ways.  There may be reasons for telling the lie and fleeing from the police apart from the realisation of guilt.
For example, such conduct may be the product of panic.  It may be to escape an unjust accusation.  It may be to protect some other person or to avoid a consequence unrelated to the offence and you have heard from Mr Di Maria at least that in his mind the motivation for his flight was a fear of Phillip Minotte, a fear of some retribution from members of the deceased's family and, whether or not you accept that, is a matter for you.  I am just pointing out that that is the explanation Mr Di Maria has given.
If you think there's a reasonable possibility that the conduct of the accused can be explained in such a way, then you cannot use it for the purpose of drawing the inference that the Crown asks you to draw.
If you are satisfied, however, that the accused's conduct cannot be explained in that way, then you are entitled to use that finding in combination with the other two factors (a) and (b) in order to draw the inference that the Crown asks you to draw.""  (SU 20 - 22)
188The submission as to consciousness of guilt was put to the jury by the Crown prosecutor as follows:
""As soon as Flight Centre opened he went there, booked a flight straight away.  Again, what's his reason to flee the country?  Because he could get into trouble for trying to steal some drugs.  There's no criminal offence of defending your own life, trying to save yourself.  He fled the country because he got the money.  He had got what he wanted and wanted to go and take advantage of it.  More than that, he never wanted to come and face up to what he'd done.
He came back into Australia under a completely different name.  No one even knew he was back.  You heard from Detective Malone he didn't even know how he got back in the country.  You know now because he has given evidence about it.  He changed his name to Michael Watkins.  He didn't want face you members of the jury and face this allegation.  Even on 24 August 2007 he'd run from the Police.  Why?  Because he was afraid that people would find out that he had to defend his own life from Christian Minotte or that people would find out he wanted to buy drugs or steal some drugs, or was his number one fear he'd be dealt with for trying to rob a man in the course of which either he or Frank Penza shot and deliberately killed Christian Minotte.  Was that what he was fleeing from?""  (T.709.35 - 710.6)
189The proposition put by the Crown prosecutor to the jury was that the reaction by the appellants in telling lies and by fleeing the jurisdiction were excessive when one took into account the facts of the deceased's death as put forward by them and were more consistent with them having committed murder.
190The appellants' submission receives support from what was said by Simpson J (with whom Ipp JA and Adams J agreed) in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 where her Honour said in relation to the principles applicable to the admissibility of evidence as to consciousness of guilt:
""23 To these I would add that the lie must be capable of being seen as indicating consciousness of guilt of the specific offence with which the accused is charged.
24 Two separate issues arise when the Crown tenders such evidence.  The first goes to the admission of the evidence. In order to admit the evidence tendered, the trial judge must be satisfied that it is capable of meeting the five conditions outlined.  If it is not so capable then the evidence is inadmissible. ...""
191It seems to me that care has to be taken when applying her Honour's fifth principle.  On the facts in Cook, it was clearly applicable.  There are, however, limits to its applicability.  It does not mean that in any case where there was evidence of consciousness of guilt with regard to a major crime, and the accused accepted that he or she had committed a minor crime that therefore evidence of consciousness of guilt would be inadmissible.  If there is a logical connection between the actions relied upon as evidencing a consciousness of guilt and the offence in respect of which that evidence is adduced, I would regard the evidence as admissible.
192In my opinion, such a logical connection existed here.  On either scenario, the actions of the appellants were motivated by their knowledge of the death of the deceased and the part they had played in the occasioning of his death.  It was a quintessential jury question as to whether it considered, as the Crown invited, that it was more consistent with them having committed the offence of murder.  It is also not without significance that no objection was taken to the evidence on the basis of inadmissibility.  I have concluded that the evidence was admissible.
193No challenge was made by the appellants to the directions given by the trial judge as to the use which the jury could make of the evidence, nor could there be.  Her Honour clearly and succinctly pointed out to the jury that it must be satisfied that what was in the mind of each of the appellants was consciousness of guilt of the offence charged before it could be taken into account.
194This ground of appeal raises another issue which was not addressed in submissions to the Court but in respect of which something needs to be said.  It relates to a difference of opinion which emerged in the Court as to whether the provisions of s 137 Evidence Act 1995 are mandatory, so that a trial judge has an obligation not to admit evidence coming within the section, even though no objection was taken to that evidence at trial.
195In Steve v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 213; (2009) 189 A Crim R 68 Beazley JA (with whom Hislop and Price JJ agreed) said:
""60 ... Even if some basis of relevance could be found (other than as tendency or propensity evidence) the evidence was prejudicial.  The trial judge was under an obligation to refuse to admit the evidence, if its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant:  Evidence Act, s 137.  Section 137 is mandatory in its terms and is not dependant upon objection being taken to the admission of the evidence.  As Heydon JA (as his Honour then was), stated in R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 186;  (2002) 130 A Crim R 44, at 47:
""... the terms of [s 137] are mandatory.  They must be complied with whether or not a party who might gain from their invocation actually invokes them.  It is notable that Pt 3.11 (in which s 137 appears) ... [is] not listed as among the provisions which the court may, with the parties' consent, dispense with:  s 190.""""
In FDP v R [2008] NSWCCA 317; 74 NSWLR 645 the Court (McClellan CJ at CL; Grove and Howie JJ) said:
""16 Because no objection was taken to the evidence, there was no occasion for the trial judge to consider the probative value of it or the danger of unfair prejudice arising from it; cf s 137 of the Evidence Act. Yet the appellant argues that the evidence to which the ground relates was either inadmissible or unfairly prejudicial such that it should never have been before the jury. Having regard to the issue raised in this appeal the Court brought to the attention of the parties, before the hearing, the decision in Steve v R [2008] NSWCCA 231 so that they could consider it and if necessary rely upon that decision or seek to distinguish it. The appellant embraced the decision. The Crown submitted that the decision should not be followed with regard to the interpretation of s 137 favoured by that Court.
17 In Steve this Court held that s 137 was mandatory so that a trial judge has an obligation to reject evidence where its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice notwithstanding that no objection had been taken to it during the course of the trial, see per Beazley JA at [60], quoting from Heydon JA in R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 186; (2002) 130 A Crim R 44, at 47, and at [82].
18 It should be noted that there is no reference to r 4 in the judgment of Beazley JA notwithstanding that no objection was taken to any of the evidence that was the subject of the grounds of appeal. It may be the case that the Crown did not rely upon r 4 as there is no reference to it in the summary of the Crown arguments contained in the judgment of her Honour.  Beazley JA concluded at [87] that ""the Court cannot be satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred"". But had r 4 been invoked, the appellant would have had to satisfy the Court that there had been a miscarriage of justice notwithstanding the failure of defence counsel to take any objection to the evidence: Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 per McHugh J at 319; R v Moussa [2001] NSWCCA 427; R v Villa [2005] NSWCCA 4 at [77].
19 Nor is there any reference in the reasoning of the Court to the decision of this Court in R v Reid [1990] NSWCCA 258 or the decision of the High Court in Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40; 217 CLR 1. It is apparent that the Court's attention was not brought to either of these important decisions that deal with the interpretation of evidentiary provisions in legislation in this State. We note that there is no reference to Reid in the judgment of Heydon J in Le and Dhanhoa was a judgment delivered after Le was decided.""
196The Court then at [20] - [28] analysed those decisions and others to arrive at the following conclusion:
""29 So far as s 137 is concerned, we do not understand how a trial judge could reliably undertake the balancing exercise that the section requires between the probative value of the evidence and the danger of unfair prejudice without a complete understanding of both the Crown and defence cases and the arguments to be addressed to the jury by the parties. Yet the section is engaged when the Crown first introduces the evidence that is later impugned in this Court. This difficulty is alone sufficient to lead us to the conclusion that s 137 cannot operate to oblige a judge to reject evidence that may later be seen in the context of the whole of the trial to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
30 Strictly speaking it was unnecessary for the Court in Steve to determine the issues raised by construing s 137 as it did. However, nothing we have written is to be taken as suggesting that the decision was in any way erroneous in finding that the trial miscarried by the reception of the evidence in the circumstances of that particular case. Nor does it necessary follow that a miscarriage of justice would not have been found had r 4 been applied. However, we respectfully disagree with the finding that the miscarriage of justice arose from the failure of the trial judge of his own motion to reject evidence to which no objection had been taken by the solicitor for the defence.""
197In Chand v R [2011] NSWCCA 53 with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Blanch J, I upheld a ground of appeal based on s 137 Evidence Act, even though objection had not be taken to the evidence at trial.  I did so because the Court was referred to the decision in Steve v R but was not referred to FDP.  Having now had the opportunity of reading both those decisions, I have no doubt as to the correctness of the reasoning in FDP and that on this issue, Le and Steve should not be followed.
198In Shepherd v R [2011] NSWCCA 245 the Court (Tobias AJA, Johnson and Hall JJ) confirmed the correctness of FDP as follows:
""30 This Court has held that s.137 of the Act does not impose an obligation on a trial judge to reject evidence to which no objection has been taken at trial by defence counsel: R v FDP [2008] NSWCCA 317; 74 NSWLR 645 at 652 [28]-[30]. We consider that this Court should be careful in the assessment of submissions made by reference to provisions of the Act which are said to apply, when no argument to that effect was made to the trial Judge (in particular by experienced counsel).""
199It follows that her Honour did not err in admitting the evidence as to consciousness of guilt without carrying out the balancing exercise mandated by s 137 Evidence Act 1995.  Since no miscarriage of justice was involved in the admission of the evidence I would, had it been necessary, have rejected this ground of appeal under r 4.
200This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Conclusion
201In this Court the Crown sought to formulate a case against the appellants which was not run at trial.  The Crown was not allowed to pursue that course.  On that issue I gratefully adopt the reasons of Campbell J at [215] - [225].
202For the reasons set out in the consideration of ground 1, the orders which I propose are as follows:
(1) Leave to appeal granted.(2) Appeal allowed.(3) The verdicts of guilty, entered on 30 July 2009 in respect of both appellants, should be quashed and in lieu thereof there should be entered a verdict of acquittal in favour of both appellants.
203CAMPBELL J:  I have had the great advantage of reading the judgment of Hoeben JA in draft.  With the exception of that aspect of Ground 4 dealt with by his Honour from [194] to [198], with great respect, I agree with his Honour's reasons and with his orders. Button J has arrived at a different view about whether a shot was fired into the deceased's kitchen on the night of his death. I acknowledge the force of his Honour's analysis. Had my view been like his, I would have arrived at the conclusions his Honour expresses at [268]-[270].  
204As it is a serious step for a Court of Criminal Appeal to set aside a conviction based on the verdict of a jury (MFA at 621 [51]), I wish to briefly state my own conclusion in that regard.
205As Hoeben JA points out at [142] by reference to the well known authorities there cited, the central issue to be decided by this Court is one of fact (M v R at 492-3 per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ). This being so, leave is required to advance Ground 1 (s 5(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912) and, in common with Hoeben JA, I would grant it.
206I wish to record that I have made my own independent assessment of the evidence and I have determined that notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which the jury might have convicted, nonetheless the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence (s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act), for the reasons advanced by Hoeben JA.
207In arriving at this conclusion, I have borne firmly in mind that the jury had the ""advantage"" of seeing and hearing Mr Di Maria give evidence. And I have had regard to the argument advanced on behalf of the Crown, based on R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 638 [48] per Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ, that a circumstantial case like this is not to be considered piecemeal (see also Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] [1984] HCA 7; 153 CLR 521 at 535; Plomp v The Queen [1963] HCA 44; 110 CLR 234 at 242). In Hillier the plurality said at 639[49] - [50]:
...the question for the Court of Appeal was whether, on the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that [Mr. Hillier] was guilty.
In that regard it is important to recognise that Mr Hillier gave evidence at his trial. The Court of Appeal made no reference to this evidence when considering whether the jury's verdict should be set aside. One question which the jury was bound to consider was what they made of Mr Hillier's evidence. Did they believe that Mr Hillier may have been telling the truth when he denied responsibility for Ms Hardwick's death? Or were they, as the verdict revealed, positively persuaded on a consideration of all of the evidence (including his) that he was not?  (Emphasis in the original)
208It should also be noted, for what it is worth, that Mr. Penza relied upon Mr Di Maria's evidence at the trial, although Mr Penza himself, as Hoeben JA has pointed out, did not give evidence.  
209I acknowledge that seeing and hearing Mr Di Maria give evidence is an advantage enjoyed by the jury, which cannot be recreated in this Court.  As in Hillier their verdict reveals that the jury must have rejected Mr Di Maria's evidence.  
210In my judgment, the rejection of Mr Di Maria's evidence is not a circumstance, whether taken alone, or in conjunction with all the other circumstances, from which it was open to the jury to draw the inference that the appellants went to the deceased's home armed. As Hoeben JA has pointed out in [94], all parties at the trial, from opening to verdict, proceeded on the basis that this was an indispensable intermediate fact required to be proved by the Crown to the jury's satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt before the jury could convict of murder. Moreover, the conclusions expressed by Hoeben JA at [150] - [152] (with the exception perhaps of the third bullet-point at the end of [150]) do not depend upon an acceptance of Mr Di Maria's truthfulness, and are not invalidated by the assumption that the jury rejected his evidence. Putting the third bullet-point to one side makes no difference. 
211Having reviewed the evidence myself, and having considered Hoeben JA's reasons, I doubt whether each accused was guilty of the crime of murder with which he was charged. In my judgment, this doubt is not capable of having been resolved at trial by the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence either of Mr Di Maria, or of all of the witnesses.
212As the High Court of Australia has recently observed, [t]he criminal standard of proof is a designedly exacting standard:  Douglass v The Queen [2012] HCA 34; 86 ALJR 1086 at 1096 [48]. In my judgment, considering the whole of the evidence, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that either accused was guilty of murder.  
213In my judgment, there [is] a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted (M v R at 494) in each case.  Accordingly, in my view, this Court is bound to act and to set aside the verdicts.  
214For the reasons given by Hoeben JA I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act is engaged and accordingly, like Hoeben JA, as I have said, I would quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal be entered in each case (s6(2) Criminal Appeal Act).
215Before leaving Ground 1 there is another matter about which I wish to say something. Perhaps in tacit recognition of the difficulties facing the Crown, learned counsel who appeared on the appeal sought to raise a new point. Properly, she acknowledged that this is a different basis than that on which the Crown case was run (Crown submissions page 9 [27] - 10 [30]).  The new point was described in the following terms:
...it is submitted that there was evidence in the Crown case that was capable of supporting a conviction for felony murder on the basis that the appellants armed themselves once in the laundry of the deceased's home from the cache of weapons in the cavity wall, which they had clearly substantially demolished at the time of the confrontation with the deceased.
It was not necessary for the Crown to prove that an intention to commit an armed robbery was present at the time they entered the premises.  Such an intention could have been formed at the time they located the guns in the cavity wall and when they realised the deceased was in fact at home.
216As McHugh J put it in Liftronic Pty Ltd v Unver [2001] HCA 24; 75 ALJR 867 at 875 [44] it is an elementary rule of law that a party is bound by the conduct of his or her case. The rule is not absolute, but the circumstances justifying an exception must be most exceptional:  University of Wollongong v Metwally [No. 2] [1985] HCA 28; 59 ALJR 481 at 483.
217In Suttor v Gundowda Pty Ltd (1950) 81 CLR 418 at 438, the Court said:
The circumstances in which an appellate court will entertain a point not raised in the court below are well established. Where a point is not taken in the court below and evidence could have been given there which by any possibility could have prevented the point from succeeding, it cannot be taken afterwards.  (Emphasis added)
218This rule applies equally to criminal cases: Crampton v The Queen [2000] HCA 60; 206 CLR 161 at 171 [12] - 173 [19] per Gleeson CJ; and Fingleton v The Queen [2005] HCA 34; 227 CLR 166 at 218 [147] - [148] per Kirby J. The application of the elementary rule, and it's exceptions, to criminal appeals is given effect to by rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules, which, as is well known, is in the following terms:
No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.
219During oral argument, Hoeben JA, as presiding judge, expressed the firm view that the Crown should be restricted to the way the Crown put the case at trial (23.35T; 2.5 - 25T; 26.35T). I agree that the Crown should not be given leave to raise this point for the first time on appeal. 
220At trial, in his closing address, the learned Crown prosecutor said (714.45T):
As I indicated to you right from the start of my address, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that one of [the accused] had that firearm at the time they went to the house.
221The learned trial judge directed the jury in the following terms (summing up page 12):
What does it mean to say that the Crown must prove the elements or the ingredients of an offence beyond reasonable doubt. Well, it is important that you understand that the Crown does not have to prove every single fact that might be in dispute in this trial, with one very important exception. And that one very important exception is whether one of the accused was, to the knowledge of the other, armed with a firearm when they went to the deceased's house. That is what, in the law, we call an essential intermediate fact.  Because of the way in which this trial has been run, the Crown must prove that essential intermediate fact beyond reasonable doubt, otherwise it cannot prove the offence of murder in the way that it has mounted it's case. (Emphasis added)
222During a short break in her Honour's summing up taken for the jury's benefit, they sent a note (MFI #20) which read:
If the accused went to the property unarmed but with the knowledge that the guns were there and an intention to arm themselves; is this the same by law as bring the gun with them?
As counsel acknowledges on appeal, the question raised an issue similar to, but not identical with, the new point that the Crown wishes to raise. The learned trial judge took the views of counsel. All, and in particular the Crown prosecutor, agreed that the jury should be dissuaded from following that line because it amounted to speculation having regard to the way the Crown put its case.
223With the concurrence of all counsel, her Honour provided the following answer to the jury's question:
The Crown case has been put squarely on the basis that the accused went to the premises armed; that they went there with a gun, so there is no other basis upon which you can consider the Crown case.
As I said, the Crown has to prove its case and prove it beyond reasonable doubt and the basis upon which your question is premised amounts to speculation. It's not the way in which the Crown case has been run. So, that is really a question that does not need to be answered in the context of this particular trial.
224Before us, the Crown sought to rely upon this new point in one of three ways: first, it was said to be a circumstance that would lead the court to find that the verdict was not unreasonable; alternatively, it was put that in the light of it that if the court was otherwise of the view that the verdict was unreasonable, there should be a new trial restricted to a charge of felony murder on the new basis; or, thirdly, an alternative charge of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act should be the subject of a re-trial, if there was room for doubt as to the foundational  crime.
225In my judgment, in all the circumstances of this case, leave should not be granted to raise this new point. It runs directly counter to the way the case was conducted by the prosecution at trial; the material I have cited demonstrates that the decision to confine the case was deliberately made by the Crown. Particularly having regard to the obligations of objectivity and fairness owed by prosecutors, the Crown ought not be permitted to resile from its considered position now. The question sought to be raised is a purely factual one, not involving any point of law. And the Crown has not demonstrated that there is no possibility that the new point could have been countered at the trial by evidence or argument, had it been raised; and I can think of no other basis upon which it could be said in the present case that there are most exceptional circumstances justifying a prosecution raising an entirely new case for the first time on appeal.
226Returning to [194] - [198] of Hoeben JA's judgment, I would prefer to reserve my position.  His Honour has exposed conflicting lines of authority in this Court about whether s.137 Evidence Act 1995 imposes a positive duty on a trial judge to exclude evidence of a type caught by it whether or not objection is taken. As his Honour points out, strictly, this aspect does not arise for the reasons expressed by his Honour at [192] - [193].  And, as the differences were not identified by counsel nor addressed by them, I would prefer to leave the resolution of the question to an appropriate case where the Court has had the benefit of full argument.
227BUTTON J:   I respectfully agree with Hoeben JA about grounds two to four, except for the following.  I prefer to adopt the approach of Campbell J of not seeking to resolve the question of the circumstances in which a trial judge should exercise the discretion to exclude evidence pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 in the absence of an application to do so.  I adopt that approach for the reasons given by Campbell J. 
228Turning to the disposition of the matter, upholding the appeals with regard to grounds two and three would, in each case, lead to an order for a new trial.  
229As for ground one, I also agree with Hoeben JA with regard to its disposition.  I respectfully agree with Hoeben JA about the applicable legal principles and the test to be applied by this Court.  I gratefully adopt the conspectus of the evidence and the course of the trial in the judgement of his Honour.  However, my analysis of the evidence that leads to the ultimate conclusion is slightly different.  Because my judgment rests on the foundations provided by Hoeben JA, I can be brief.
Crown case
230It was accepted by all parties at trial that, in order to succeed on the count of murder against each of the appellants, the Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that one or other of them went to the premises armed with a firearm, and that the other knew about that state of affairs.  
231Proof of that agreed indispensable intermediate fact was founded on a number of pieces of evidence, some of them more probative than others.  Central was the ballistics evidence, and the evidence of the neighbours as to what they had heard during the night in question.  In particular, the Crown submitted that two shots had been fired that night, and that one of them had been fired from the back verandah into the kitchen.  Acceptance of that proposition, it was submitted by the Crown at trial, would, in combination with other evidence, lead the jury to conclude that the appellants had been armed when they arrived.  
Number of shots fired?
232When the police attended the home of the deceased some hours after his death, there were two fired bullets present.  One was in the kitchen, and one could readily infer from the ballistics evidence that, at some stage, it had been fired from the back verandah into the home.  The other was in the skull of the deceased, whose body was found at the foot of the external stairs leading down from the back verandah to the laundry.
233Found in the laundry downstairs were two fired cartridge cases.  They were both from .22 calibre long ammunition.  Although they emanated from different manufacturers, Winchester and PMC, the ballistics evidence established that those fired cartridge cases had been discharged from the same firearm.  
234Every neighbour who gave evidence, and who heard shots, heard more than one.  Mr Pitt heard three, and thought that the time between the first shot and the next two was a split second, five maybe three seconds.  Ms Gaal heard two loud bangs, and thought they were separated by seconds and very close.  Mr Hughes heard a couple of sounds.  Mr Harvey heard no sounds that could be gunshots.  Mr Fausett heard two gunshots.  
235In short, two fired bullets located at the home; two fired cartridge cases found; the two fired cartridge cases discharged from the same firearm; and the preponderance of evidence from neighbours to the effect that two shots were discharged that evening.  On that material alone, I consider that it was well open to the jury to be satisfied that the bullet found in the kitchen had been discharged on the evening in question.
236However, the evidence did not end there.  The bullet fragments found in the skull of the deceased were from a round that was of .22 calibre and Winchester manufacturer.  The overwhelming inference is that those fragments were of a bullet that was a part of a live round that included the .22 Winchester fired cartridge case found in the laundry.  
237The bullet found in the kitchen could not be affirmatively matched to either cartridge case, or to the bullet in the skull of the deceased, or to a common firearm.  But nor was it in any way inconsistent with any of those matches.  Although, as a matter of forensic science, the bullet in the kitchen could not be established to have been fired from the same firearm as the fired cartridge cases, nor to have been fired from the same firearm as the bullet in the skull of the deceased, I consider that, in all the circumstances, that determination was well open to the tribunal of fact. 
238It is true that there was evidence that the deceased had been the subject of threats and attacks before.  However, it is noteworthy that the deceased had told others of those events, and given some detail about them, but had never mentioned any previous occasion upon which a shot had been discharged into his home, and which could therefore explain the bullet found in the kitchen.
239It would also be strange (although not impossible) for a person to leave a bullet that had previously been fired into his or her home lying on the kitchen floor for days, weeks or months.  
240It is true that, if the bullet in the kitchen was fired that night from the verandah, it must be linked to the PMC fired cartridge case found in the laundry.  That means that the weapon from which that bullet was discharged must have been a weapon from which fired cartridge cases are ejected manually for the hypothesis to hold true.  Were it otherwise, one would expect the fired cartridge case associated with the bullet in the kitchen to be found on or near the verandah.  
241Whilst it is true that it would be odd for a shot to have been fired from the verandah outside the kitchen and for the weapon not to be manually cleared until it was in the laundry, I consider that, in the context of a fast developing confrontation, such a state of affairs is not inconceivable.
242If the PMC fired cartridge case in the laundry is not associated with the bullet found in the kitchen, there must be a fired bullet somewhere associated with that fired cartridge case (subject to the evidence of Mr Di Maria, which I discuss below).  It is correct that the failure of the police to locate such a third bullet is not determinative of the matter, because the bullet could have travelled a long distance away from the home, and the search was, understandably, not extensive.  However, I consider that the failure to find a third bullet goes some distance to supporting the proposition that the fired bullet in the kitchen is associated with the PMC fired cartridge case found in the laundry.
243Mr Di Maria gave evidence.  His position was that only one shot was fired, and that was during a struggle between himself and the deceased.  How then could there be two fired cartridge cases from the same firearm found in the laundry?  His explanation was as follows.  When the deceased confronted Mr Di Maria, the deceased pulled the trigger of the sawn-off bolt-action rifle that the deceased was holding.  Nothing happened, and thereafter the deceased manually cleared the chamber by way of manipulating the bolt.  The result was that a fired cartridge case was ejected onto the floor of the laundry.  In other words, the deceased when he confronted Mr Di Maria did so with a firearm that had no live round in the chamber, but rather nothing more than a fired cartridge case.
244The deceased was a firearms enthusiast.  He collected and secreted a large number of them.  He was also a drug dealer who kept substantial amounts of drugs and money in his home.  He was deeply concerned about security, and indeed slept in a barricaded bathroom.  He was a man who was prepared to defend his possessions.  On the night in question, he had had time to swallow balloons filled with drugs before he was killed.  In all of those circumstances, I reject the proposition that such a person would confront an intruder with a firearm that was, in the immediate circumstances, useless because, for some reason, it was loaded with a fired cartridge case that had not been previously cleared from the chamber.  
245Mr Di Maria sought to explain the second fired cartridge case by evidence to the effect that, after the gun went off involuntarily and without an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on his part, he immediately re-loaded by manipulating the bolt.  That brought a fresh live cartridge into the chamber and discharged the fired cartridge case that was associated with the bullet that killed the deceased.  The net result was that two fired cartridge cases ended up on the laundry floor, although only one shot was fired that night.  
246Such a chain of events to explain the second fired cartridge case is possible.  However, the position of Mr Di Maria was that he and Mr Penza had travelled to the home of the deceased merely to buy drugs.  Mr Di Maria had nothing against the deceased.  Thereafter, believing that the deceased was away from his home, they decided to steal his drugs.  After that, in a struggle between the deceased and Mr Di Maria, the deceased was shot in the head, involuntarily and without any intention to inflict harm or kill.  
247It seems strange indeed that a man who has been involved in the accidental (to use an imprecise word) shooting of a man to whom he bore no animus should immediately re-load, rather than (as may be more likely) going to the assistance of the victim of the completely accidental shooting.
248In short, I reject the explanation of Mr Di Maria as to the presence of the two fired cartridge cases in the laundry, on two bases.  Of course, in order to convict Mr Di Maria and Mr Penza, the jury must have rejected most if not all of the evidence of Mr Di Maria as well.
249Quite apart from my rejection of the explanation of Mr Di Maria about the central question of the presence of the two fired cartridge cases in the laundry, I have read the whole of his evidence.  His assertions about a number of matters, including but not limited to his desire to hand himself in to the police, his feelings about the death of the deceased after it occurred, and his retention of the stolen money, strain credulity.  He did not fare well in cross-examination.  Based on an analysis of his evidence as a whole, I am comfortable in putting the whole of it to one side.  
250It is true that the general thrust of the evidence of the neighbours is that they heard the shots very close together.  That is, I accept, on its face inconsistent with the Crown proposition that the true course of events was, in all likelihood, as follows:  a bullet was discharged from the verandah into the kitchen as part of an attack on the deceased; the shooter and the firearm then travelled down the external stairs to the laundry; the fired cartridge case was cleared from the weapon in that location; a further bullet was discharged in that area, and it entered the skull of the deceased; and that second discharge was followed by the manual ejection of a further fired cartridge case onto the floor of the laundry. 
251I consider that there are two responses to that inconsistency.  The first is that, in a fast developing confrontation, it is not inconceivable that the firearm was discharged on the verandah, and then, very soon after, the shooter and the firearm travelled by way of the external stairs to the laundry, at which location the firearm was discharged a second time, fatally wounding the deceased.  It is true that the second shot could not have been a split second after the first in those circumstances.  But it could have been only a matter of some seconds afterwards.  The following examination of the evidence of the neighbours as a whole shows that such a scenario is not really inconsistent with their evidence.  
252As I have said above at [234], Mr Hughes heard two shots but did not give any evidence regarding the time between those shots.  Mr Harvey did not hear any sounds that could be identified as gunshots.  Mr Fausett heard two gunshots and also did not give any evidence regarding the time between the shots.  Ms Gaal heard two shots and described the time between them as ""very close"" and within ""seconds"". Finally, Mr Pitt heard three bangs and in cross-examination described the time between the first shot and, the second and third shots as ""quicker than 30 seconds, it was only a split second"" and ""five seconds, maybe three"" seconds.   
253The second response is that, as was said by Gummow and Callinan JJ in Velevski v The Queen [2002] HCA 4; (2002) 186 ALR 233 at [192], not every aspect of the Crown case must be able to be explained with perfect exactitude in order for a conviction to be maintained in the face of a ground such as the one under consideration.  
254In summary, every neighbour who gave evidence of having heard gunfire that night heard more than one shot.  That fact, combined with the ballistics evidence, persuades me that it was open to the jury to be satisfied that the bullet in the kitchen was fired from outside the home; that it was fired from the same firearm as the firearm that fired the bullet that caused the death of the deceased; and that the bullet in the kitchen was fired during the fatal incident.  I am satisfied of those propositions as well, if necessary to the criminal standard.  
Proof of armed arrival?
255That leads to consideration of the second question; namely, whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied that the firearm used to discharge those two shots had been brought to the home by one offender with the knowledge of the other, and not involved in the incident by some other mechanism.  It will be recalled that, at the trial, the Crown restricted itself to that proposition.  The Crown explicitly disavowed seeking a conviction based upon the proposition that the appellants had obtained the weapon at the home, whether from the arsenal in the laundry, or after having been confronted by the deceased, who was armed, and disarming him.  To put it another way, if the jury had had a reasonable doubt as to whether or not the firearm used was brought to the home or obtained at the home of the deceased, the jury should have acquitted both appellants.  That was the case even if the jury had been satisfied that, howsoever the firearm ended up at the scene, one of the foundational offences for extended joint criminal enterprise murder or extended joint criminal enterprise felony murder had been made out.
256I respectfully agree with the course adopted by Hoeben JA at the hearing of this appeal of restricting the Crown to reliance on the case as presented at trial, for the reasons given in the judgment of Campbell J.  
257Merely because I am satisfied that two shots were fired that night from the same weapon, and one of those shots was fired into the home, does not lead ineluctably to the proposition that one must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that weapon had been brought to the home on the evening in question.  
258The evidence established a number of matters.  The first was that a bullet had been fired from the back verandah into the kitchen.  The second was that the fatal shot had, almost certainly, been fired in the laundry.  The third was that there had been some sort of violence visited upon the deceased, based upon the injuries to his body that went beyond those that could have been caused by a fall, perhaps down the stairs.  The fourth is that the deceased had had time to swallow balloons containing drugs very shortly before he died.  The fifth is that, based upon the DNA evidence, the two appellants were there, at least at some stage, and had themselves suffered injuries.  The sixth is that, at some stage that morning, cash and drugs were robbed or stolen from the upstairs portion of the home of the deceased.
259Beyond that, it is difficult to discern with clarity what occurred.  As the learned Crown Prosecutor himself said to the jury in his final address ""[i]ndeed, every question or every riddle will not be solved in this matter"".
260Three further arguments were placed before the jury for or against the proposition that the appellants had arrived at the home armed.  The Crown submitted that Mr Penza knew that the deceased had access to firearms; that he knew that the deceased would not be averse to using them; and that it would have been a simple matter for Mr Penza to inform his close friend Mr Di Maria of that fact.  
261In contrast, the defence submitted that the evidence was that, prior to attending at the home of the deceased, the appellants engaged in a lengthy evening drinking session with friends.  It was only after that that they attended at the home.  It was submitted that those circumstances were more consistent with a spontaneous effort to buy drugs that developed into a spontaneous plan to steal whilst unarmed, rather than a predetermination to rob whilst armed.   
262Furthermore, the defence submitted that the noisy conduct of the appellants at the scene was hardly consistent with a plan to commit armed robbery.  One would hardly expect, it was submitted, the appellants to wish to attract attention to that offence.
263Ultimately, I consider that all three aspects have some force, but none of them is determinative.    
264Taking into account the whole of the evidence, I do not consider that it is reasonably possible that the appellants arrived unarmed, obtained a firearm from the cavity in the laundry, and then confronted the deceased.  The process of obtaining a weapon from inside the cavity by demolishing it with a sledgehammer or other implement would simply have been too loud and too lengthy to have permitted that to occur without attracting the attention and intervention of the deceased.
265However, I do consider that it is reasonably possible that the firearm that inflicted the fatal injury to the deceased was produced by him at the home, and not brought to the scene by the appellants.  It is to be recalled that he was a busy drug dealer who was obsessed with security to the point of sleeping in the bathroom.  He was in possession of an arsenal in the downstairs laundry, but to which he did not have ready access because of the method of concealment he had adopted.  He was known to possess at least one manually operated weapon.  More than one witness gave evidence that he was a man who, when it came to defending the fruits of his illicit labours, would not take a backward step.  The proposition that the two appellants would be unlikely to move from a relaxed evening of drinking and watching rugby league on television to an armed robbery of a close relative and friend with a loaded firearm has some force.
266In all the circumstances, I consider that it is reasonably possible that the deceased had ready access to a firearm and ammunition in the home that evening.  I also consider it reasonably possible that, at some stage, he confronted the appellants with a loaded firearm.
267It is quite true that it is not possible to formulate a chain of events founded on that proposition that explains with perfect precision all of the undisputed evidence in the trial.  Certainly, it is hard to see what reason the deceased would have had to fire a shot deliberately from the verandah into his own home.  Nor, if it be the case that it was the appellants who stole money and drugs from the upstairs part of the home, is it hard to imagine them delaying to do so after a man had been fatally shot in a home in a suburban street.  The same may be said about any attack on the cavity in the laundry that took place after the shooting.
268There are two answers to that impossibility.  The first is that it is not, of course, for the appellants to discharge any onus with regard to this ground.
269The second is that it seems to me that the following general hypothesis cannot be excluded beyond reasonable doubt: the deceased became aware of the appellants outside; fearing robbery, he swallowed the drug-filled balloons; he walked out on to the verandah armed with a loaded manually operated firearm and confronted them; a struggle developed between the three of them in that location; a shot was fired in the course of that struggle into the house; the melee moved quickly to the laundry; the weapon was cleared in that location; and the fatal shot was fired, whether by one of the appellants, or the deceased, and whether or not voluntarily or with an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm.
270On such a reasonably possible scenario, and recalling the basis upon which the Crown case was presented at trial, an indispensable intermediate fact within that case has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  Accordingly the Crown case has not been made out, and the appellants should be acquitted of murder.
271Speaking more generally, after having reviewed and reflected upon the whole of the evidence for myself, I am unable to say that I have no reasonable doubt about the correctness of the two convictions.  
Conclusion
272In short, I am satisfied to the criminal standard that two shots were fired from the same firearm during the fatal incident, and that one of them was fired from outside the home into the home.  However, proof of that fact does not of itself establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants travelled armed to the scene.  I experience a reasonable doubt about that fact.  Because of the way in which the trial was run, that means that I have a reasonable doubt about whether the offence of murder has been established.  That is a doubt that the jury should have shared.  Their advantage in assessing the witnesses giving their evidence in person does not alter that position.  That is especially so in light of the fact that the vast majority of the evidence in the Crown case was not disputed, but rather the subject of different interpretations.  And the proposition is strengthened by the fact that the jury and I have taken the same approach to the credibility of the evidence of Mr Di Maria. 
273It is for those reasons that I agree that ground one should be upheld, and that the conviction for murder entered against each appellant should be quashed, and a verdict of acquittal entered with regard to each appellant.

2ROTHMAN J: The applicant, Akin Sen, seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed on him by the District Court on 20 May 2011 for the offences of robbery in company (Count 1) and detain person in company with intent to obtain advantage (Count 2). If leave were granted, the applicant appeals the sentence. 

3The sole ground of appeal was disparity in the sentence between the applicant and his co-offender, Ms Amna Hamze. In relation to Count 1, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years, 4 months and 24 days with a non-parole period of 4 years and 18 days. For Count 2, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years, 4 months and 24 days, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 18 days. The sentences were to be served wholly concurrently, so the overall sentence was identical to the sentence for each count. 

4The co-offender was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years, 2 months and 30 days, with a non-parole period of 2 years, 1 month and 14 days. The applicant submits that he has a justified sense of grievance arising from the disparity in the sentence imposed upon him and his co-offender. Each of them was sentenced by the same judge. 

Brief summary of crime

5On 23 January 2008, the applicant and three other people (the co-offender and another man and woman) travelled to premises at Bidwill. This had been prearranged. One of the residents at that premises was Mr Boye. 

6The vehicles that transported the applicant, his co-offender and the two unnamed persons parked in the street of Mr Boye's premises. The two women approached Mr Boye and discussed collecting drugs. One of the women asked to use the toilet and entered the house. The applicant then approached the premises. Mr Boye, the applicant, his co-offender and the unnamed woman entered the house at the request of the unnamed woman. 

7The unnamed woman grabbed Mr Boye and the applicant pushed Mr Boye. They dragged him into the bedroom. Mr Boye noticed that the unnamed woman had a knife. She lunged at him and stabbed his forearm. The unnamed woman demanded to know the combination of the safe and Mr Boye's hiding spot for the drugs. The applicant pulled the safe off the wall around this time. The unnamed woman held the knife to Mr Boye, spun him around and stole his wallet from his back pocket. She pushed him on to the bed, tied his ankles together and stole his watch. A number of other items were also stolen from the premises. 

8His Honour assessed the applicant and the co-offender as having played a ""similar role in the facts which gave rise to slightly different offences"". His Honour remarked (ROS 12) that there was ""no immediate explanation as to why they were charged with different offences considering the very similar roles which they each played"". Further, his Honour found that there was no evidence that Mr Sen was aware that a knife was to be used in the commission of the offence. 

9The Crown has quite properly conceded that the respective criminality of each of Mr Sen and his co-offender was ""essentially the same"". The applicant and co-offender were charged with different offences, for which no explanation has been forthcoming. The co-offender was charged with the more serious offences, carrying a maximum sentence of 25 years' imprisonment and a standard non-parole period, while the maximum sentence for the offences with which the applicant was charged is 20 years' imprisonment, no standard non-parole period being prescribed.

Subjective circumstances

10Mr Sen left school at 16 years of age, having completed year 10. He commenced, but did not complete, a mechanical skills course at TAFE. While he had been employed intermittently in the intervening years, he had been substantially unemployed for the two-year period leading up to his arrest. 

11Mr Sen has a ""relatively brief and unremarkable criminal history"" (ROS 8). The sentencing judge concluded that Mr Sen suffers from bipolar disorder (ROS 9). His Honour declined, because there was no submission to that effect and no evidence to support it, to find the existence of any mental illness at the time of the commission of the offence. 

12Dr Teoh, a psychiatrist qualified by the applicant and whose report was before the sentencing judge as Annexure B to an affidavit of 3 November 2010, diagnosed Mr Sen as having Bipolar Mood Disorder (as per DSM-IV), which would cause unstable mood. The unstable mood can affect judgment. Dr Teoh's opinion was that:

""He could be impulsive and disinhibited during period of hypomania, and profoundly negative in his assessment and decision when he becomes depressed.""

13According to Dr Teoh, Mr Sen has a long history of psychiatric illness. He had a history of polysubstance abuse. Mr Sen's mother was diagnosed as bipolar and admitted as a consequence. Bipolar disorder is a condition with high genetic predisposition and Mr Sen had a history of significant depression in the background of unstable mood, which supports the diagnosis from an earlier age.

14Mr Sen also qualified Dr Furst, a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose report of 26 April 2011 was also before the Court below. 

15Mr Sen was 31 years old and lived with his mother. His father, to whom he was very close, died in May 2010. He was in a previous relationship from 1998 to 2004. Following the breakdown in the relationship, there were continuing disputes with his ex-girlfriend regarding their children. 

16During the course of that disputation, the feelings of uselessness manifested, and his ex-partner informed him that the children were not his, which devastated him. He has two daughters, living with his ex-partner, and with whom he has had no contact for four years, notwithstanding that he has established that he is the biological father. 

17As already stated, he has had significant issues with drug and alcohol abuse and the sentencing judge rejected evidence of remission.

18He is in a current relationship and his partner was pregnant at the time of the sentencing hearing.

19The sentencing judge considered that he was unable to conclude that Mr Sen had any genuine remorse or any ""reasonable prospects"" for rehabilitation. Nevertheless, the sentencing judge considered the applicant's rehabilitation prospects as ""at best fair"" (ROS 10.5 to 11.7). For that conclusion, his Honour relied substantially upon Mr Sen's attitude to the sentencing hearing, his failure to give oral evidence of remorse and his repeated assertion of a version of events that was significantly different from the agreed facts. 

20While his Honour considered that the opinion of an appropriately qualified medical practitioner as to the likely success of any drug and alcohol counselling was relevant to assessing the prospects of rehabilitation, his Honour rejected the opinion of Dr Furst, because Dr Furst was: unaware of Mr Sen's ""inconsistent drug history""; unaware of the falsity of Mr Sen's denial of recent drug use; and unaware of Mr Sen's persistent avoidance of the facts surrounding these offences. However, Dr Teoh also commented on this aspect and suggested that the applicant would benefit from appropriate psychiatric treatment.

Parity principle 

21As has been explained many times, the principle of parity in sentencing derives from the application of the fundamental principle of equal justice: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 86 ALJR 36; Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 (per Dawson and Gaudron JJ) at 301-302, citing with approval Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60.

22Equal justice is a fundamental norm (Green, supra) and an essential aspect of natural justice. It requires that like should be treated alike, and that which is unalike should be treated unalike in proportion to their ""unalikeness"": Andrews v Law Society of British Columbia [1989] 1 SCR 143, per McIntyre J, citing Aristotle's Ethica Nicomachea; R v Tiddy [1969] SASR 575.

23In Tiddy, supra, the South Australian Supreme Court said:

""... Where other things are equal persons concerned in the same crime should receive the same punishment; and where other things are not equal a due discrimination should be made."" 

24I reiterate my comments in Carruthers v R [2007] NSWCCA 276 with which Mason P and Hidden J agreed, in which the following was said:

""[19] The task of sentencing is a difficult one involving the reconciliation of sometimes conflicting goals including retribution, punishment, general and specific deterrence, protection of the community, rehabilitation, denunciation and accountability: see section 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Recitation of those goals immediately displays the tension between them. Moreover, sentencing is not a mathematical exercise (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 79 ALJR 1048); different sentencing judges will arrive at different results, within an appropriate range, that are nevertheless correct and so long as the result is consonant with consistency of approach and accords with the statutory regime, as much flexibility as possible must be allowed: Markarian, supra, at [27]; Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at 618 [5].

[20] Where, as here, reliance is placed upon the disparity of sentence between co-offenders particular principles apply. Those principles are well established. The principles that apply to parity in sentencing are a manifestation of the application of the principles of equal justice. They require that like should be treated alike and, where there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for such differences: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301 (per Dawson and Gaudron JJ); R v Tiddy [1969] SASR 575 at 577.

[21] Discrepancy is not, itself, sufficient to warrant intervention by an appellate court, unless, viewed objectively, the discrepancy is unjustifiable. The comparison is made between the objectively determined culpability of the offenders in their respective roles in the offence, together with the differences in the subjective factors that are applied to each offender. Where there are unjustifiable differences, an appellate court will not intervene to reduce a sentence to a level that would be inappropriate for the offence in question. The fixing of an inappropriate sentence, for the sake of parity, may bring the administration of justice into disrepute as much or more than retaining the disparity would: McKenna v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 113 at [48]- [55].""

Consideration 

25If there be a distinction in the respective criminal culpability of Mr Sen and Ms Hamze, it is not significant. Each has been involved in the same crime to the same, or an insignificantly different, degree. 

26No two offenders are identical. In this case, Mr Sen and Ms Hamze differ in their subjective circumstances. Each of Ms Hamze and Mr Sen were on conditional liberty at the time of the offence. Each had a criminal history, although Ms Hamze's criminal history is significantly more extensive than that of the applicant and it included a number of entries for dishonesty and violence. 

27Ms Hamze had suffered much as a child. She was sexually assaulted at 16 as a result of which she was subject to threats from her father for what he saw was the shame she had brought upon their family. She was sent to Lebanon, where she was forced into an arranged marriage to a man who proved to be violent and abusive. She was subsequently divorced for which she suffered the further opprobrium of her family. 

28Most significantly to the sentencing judge, Ms Hamze was suffering, on his view, psychological or psychiatric disorders at the time of the commission of the offence, whereas Mr Sen's bipolar disorder manifested, it was held, only after the offence. His Honour, as a consequence of this finding, reduced Ms Hamze's sentence significantly. 

29The Crown, in its submissions to this Court, submits that these ""factors taken together led the sentencing judge to impose a lesser sentence upon Ms Hamze than that imposed upon the applicant"". The applicant submits that the differences between the circumstances of the applicant and the co-offender can not lead to the difference in the sentences imposed on each, even if some difference is warranted.

30As the High Court said in Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 608 (per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ):

""To focus on the result of the sentencing task, to the exclusion of the reasons which support the result, is to depart from fundamental principles of equal justice. Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect.""

31Yet, the issue must be examined from the perspective of whether, objectively, the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance. Such a sense of grievance can be manifest even though there are reasons for some difference in sentence when the difference is greater than equal justice dictates. This is such a case. Moreover, I accept the sentencing judge's statement that ""the sentence [for Mr Sen] should [not] be lesser to a significant or any degree"", although the result implemented by his Honour was somewhat inconsistent with that expressed sentiment.

32In this case, the difference in the sentence imposed on Mr Sen is not implementing to an appropriate degree the difference in subjective circumstances, and, given that the objective criminality is the same, the appeal should be allowed, and the applicant re-sentenced.

33I take account of each of the subjective factors to which the sentencing judge has referred relating to both Mr Sen and, by comparison, Ms Hamze. I reiterate that sentencing judges should not impose sentences in ""days"", regardless of the arithmetic calculation arising from some discount or time already served. The latter should be accommodated by an appropriate commencement date for the sentence and, otherwise, the sentence or discount should be rounded.

34In my view an appropriate differential between Mr Sen and his co-offender to account for the different subjective circumstances is approximately 6 months in the head sentence, and, applying the parity principle, I would impose on the applicant a sentence of imprisonment of a head sentence of 4 years and 9 months. 

35I turn then to the issue of special circumstances. In order to find special circumstances, the Court should be satisfied that the circumstances are truly ""special"", namely, pertain distinctly or particularly to the offender being sentenced. Unlike his Honour the sentencing judge, and, in part at least, based on the additional evidence on which this Court may now rely, I take the view that the applicant needs a more substantial period of rehabilitation to complete in the community the drug dependence rehabilitation that he has now commenced in prison and, to the extent possible in that environment, successfully completed. 

36Further, it is important that the applicant have an extended period of supervision in the community to complete that rehabilitation and to effect a structure for the appropriate medication and treatment of his bipolar disorder. In those circumstances, I find special circumstances. 

37I propose that the Court issue the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal be granted;

(2)Appeal allowed;

(3)Sentence imposed on Mr Sen by the District Court on 20 May 2011 be quashed and in lieu thereof:

(i) Mr Sen be sentenced for each of the offences of robbery in company and aggravated detain for advantage without consent committed on 23 January 2008, to a non-parole period of 3 years' imprisonment, commencing 1 March 2011 and concluding 28 February 2014, with a balance of term of 1 year and 9 months, concluding 30 November 2015. Mr Sen is first eligible for release on parole on 28 February 2014.

2760974,"LANG, Dylan Craig v R [2013] NSWCCA 29","Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Rothman J.

2ROTHMAN J: Dylan Craig Lang (hereinafter, ""the applicant"") seeks leave to appeal (and if leave were granted, then appeals) the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court in Newcastle on 21 September 2011. 

3The applicant was sentenced by his Honour Justice Blanch, Chief Judge of the District Court, for one count of robbery armed with an offensive weapon, contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, and two counts of aggravated break and enter with intent to commit serious indictable offence, contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act. 

4Further, two charges were notified on a Form 1, being for a break, enter and steal committed on 23 August 2010 and a conspiracy to commit break, enter and steal committed on or about 3 September 2010.

5The learned Chief Judge imposed a sentence, for each offence of break and enter to commit serious indictable offence, of a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years, commencing, in relation to Count 2, on 2 June 2011 and, in relation to Count 3, on 2 June 2012. In relation to Count 1, the robbery armed with an offensive weapon, the Chief Judge imposed a term of imprisonment of 7 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing on 2 June 2013. The overall sentence imposed was a non-parole period of 5 years, as part of a head sentence of 9 years' imprisonment.

Grounds of appeal

6The applicant raises two grounds of appeal to justify the grant of leave and any subsequent appeal. Those grounds are:

(i)The applicant suffers a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon his co-offender, Mr Bonifasous Reuter;

(ii)The sentence imposed was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.

7If the sentence imposed were manifestly excessive, then the sentence would need to be corrected and the ground relating to disparity of sentence with the co-offender would need to relate to any corrected sentence. As a consequence, I will deal with the second ground before dealing with the allegation that there exists a justifiable sense of grievance. It is necessary to summarise the circumstances of the commission of the offence and the role of the applicant and Mr Reuter.

Circumstances of offences and offenders

8The robbery occurred on 25 March 2010, when the applicant and three others entered the garage of a Caltex Service Station at Maryland. They were wearing hoods and had their faces covered. Mr Reuter (hereinafter, ""the co-offender"") was holding a fake pistol and the applicant was holding a machete. They asked where all the money was and, once told a location, put the money in a bag.

9The applicant asked where the cigarettes were and the staff told him that the cigarettes were locked in a cabinet and access could not be gained to them. The applicant and his co-offenders left with $511.85 in cash.

10The first of the charged aggravated break and enter offences occurred on 26 August 2010 at a store in Rutherford. The applicant and two others had previously been to the store to examine its layout. At 11.56pm, the applicant and the two others smashed a glass panel and entered the store. They proceeded to smash cabinets and they took a variety of electrical items. Prior to the offence occurring, the applicant had contacted a number of people by telephone for the purpose of seeking to sell the items to be stolen.

11The second of the charged aggravated break and enter offences occurred on 27 August 2010. The applicant smashed a glass front door and a number of cabinets in a store. Items, including clothing, sunglasses and a small amount of cash, were stolen.

12The first matter notified on the Form 1 was an aggravated break, enter and steal committed on 23 August 2010. In that offence the applicant, with a number of others, entered premises by forcing the front door. That conduct triggered the security alarm. The applicant and others forced an internal door and removed a safe containing a number of banking documents.

13The second matter notified on the Form 1 involved the applicant telephoning another person and agreeing with that person to commit a break, enter and steal at Kawasaki Motorcycles in Broadmeadows.

14Because one of the grounds of appeal alleges a justifiable sense of grievance arising from the disparity in the sentences imposed upon the applicant and the co-offender, it is also necessary to look at the comparative subjective circumstances of the applicant and the co-offender. It is sufficient to summarise that comparison by a table that forms part of the written submissions of the applicant before the Court.

15While the sentencing judge's Remarks on Sentencing contain significant detail in relation to the foregoing subjective circumstances, the above summary is sufficient to understand the differences between the applicant and the co-offender upon which the applicant relies to submit that he has a justifiable sense of grievance at the disparity in the sentences imposed.

Manifest excess

16There are aspects of each of the grounds of appeal that overlap. Nevertheless the submissions that were made that rely upon a justifiable sense of grievance may, when so confined, be dealt with separately. Those submissions should be dealt with once it has been established that the sentence suffers from no other defect.

17In Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 231 at [6], Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said:

""Manifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion. A sentence is, or is not, unreasonable or plainly unjust; inadequacy or excess is, or is not, plainly apparent. It is a conclusion which does not depend upon attribution of identified specific error in the reasoning of the sentencing judge and which frequently does not admit of amplification except by stating the respect in which the sentence is inadequate or excessive. It may be inadequate or excessive because the wrong type of sentence has been imposed (for example, custodial rather than non-custodial) or because the sentence imposed is manifestly too long or too short. But to identify the type of error amounts to no more than a statement of the conclusion that has been reached. It is not a statement of reasons for arriving at the conclusion. A Court of Criminal Appeal is not obliged to employ any particular verbal formula so long as the substance of its conclusions and its reasons is made plain. The degree of elaboration that is appropriate or possible will vary from case to case.""

18Essentially the applicant seeks to utilise a number of tools to persuade the Court that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. First, the applicant relies upon the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. Secondly, the applicant relies upon sentencing statistics. 

19The guideline judgment of the Court in Henry envisages a head sentence that should generally fall between 4 to 5 years, allowing for a late plea and discount for plea. Nevertheless, there are a number of aspects of the Henry guideline which should be noted. 

20First, a guideline judgment is to be used by sentencing judges as a factor that allows sentences to be fixed, bearing in mind the need for consistency in sentencing. It is not a mandated outcome from which sentencing judges subtract or to which they add in a mathematical exercise. It is a ""check"" or ""guide"", not a ""rule"" or ""presumption"": R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252.

21The starting point (before applying a discount for the plea of guilty) that the sentencing judge used, without being precise, was significantly higher than the guideline judgment in Henry. Nevertheless, the circumstances of the offence and the circumstances of the offender were significantly more serious than those envisaged in Henry as the circumstances to which the guideline was to apply.

22The maximum sentence for the offence in question was 20 years' imprisonment and the Legislature set a standard non-parole period of 5 years' imprisonment for the aggravated break and enter, of which there were two counts. No standard non-parole period was set for the armed robbery. Yet the sentence imposed derived from a starting point of approximately 10 years' imprisonment for the armed robbery. Further, the armed robbery sentence expressly took into account a further break, enter and steal and a conspiracy to commit break, enter and steal on the Form 1. Given the objective seriousness of the robbery, while armed with an offensive weapon, taken by itself, this sentence was not manifestly excessive.

23Further, the two counts of aggravated break and enter were the subject of fixed terms of 2 years' imprisonment accumulated by 12 months (i.e. a total of 3 years' imprisonment for both offences). Likewise, the armed robbery sentence was accumulated on the sentences imposed for the two counts of aggravated break and enter in circumstances where the effect of the two sentences for aggravated break and enter was an additional imprisonment period of 2 years.

24In those circumstances, the overall sentence was not manifestly excessive. This ground of appeal should fail.

25The applicant also relied on statistics to further the submissions on manifest excess. As has been previously noted by the High Court and this Court, one must be very careful in utilising statistics for offences: Wong v R; Leung v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [59]; Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520. Such statistics are useful for the purpose of showing trends in sentencing, but each sentence must be imposed on the basis of the sentencing principles and not on the basis of an adherence to statistical averages; Hili at [54].

26Even on the statistics presented, the sentence imposed is within range, albeit at the higher end of the range, as is appropriate given the findings on objective criminality. Each offence (and the circumstances of the offender) is different. 

27Moreover, to follow statistical ranges blindly would be to constrain inappropriately the exercise of discretion reposed in a sentencing judge and render statistics a self-fulfilling limit on the intuition to be exercised in sentencing. Nothing in the statistical material contradicts the view otherwise reached.

Justifiable sense of grievance

28There are differences in the circumstances applicable to the applicant as against the co-offender. The conduct of each in the charged offences is similar and the differences, if any, in their conduct does not support a basis for a difference in the sentence.

29Further, each of the applicant and the co-offender were sentenced, in relation to the robbery, taking into account two offences notified on the Form 1. The difference in the offences notified on the Form 1 is not significant.

30However, without repeating each of the differences outlined in the table reproduced above, there are two significant differences that ought to be emphasised. Firstly, the applicant committed the armed robbery whilst on conditional liberty for two earlier aggravated robbery offences and an aggravated break and enter offence.

31Secondly, and most importantly, the applicant had a significant criminal history, including similar offences. The co-offender had no criminal history and, necessarily, was not on conditional liberty at the time of the commission of these offences.

32Further, the applicant was older than his co-offender. The sentencing judge, in sentencing the co-offender, described the applicant as ""the main leader"" in each of the offences (Co-offender's ROS, 15 February 2012, [25] at page 9).

33Each of the foregoing differences is significant and would have a substantial effect on the sentences to be imposed upon the applicant and the co-offender.

34The fact that the applicant had a record of prior convictions of the same kind as those for which he was charged and for which he was sentenced is not itself an aggravating feature in determining the sentence to be imposed. However, the nature and extent of the criminal history gives rise to the conclusion to which the High Court referred in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465. 

35In that respect, the criminal history for similar offences does not increase the objective seriousness of the offence committed but mean that ""retribution, deterrence and protection of society may indicate a more severe sentence is warranted"": see also R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 76; R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566.

36On the other hand, the co-offender's lack of prior convictions disclosed a hitherto good character, which the co-offender was entitled to have taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence. Further, as has been made clear by the High Court in Veen (No 2), supra, the absence of a prior record entitled the sentencing judge to give significant leniency in the sentence to be imposed on the co-offender.

37The sentencing judge was entitled, in relation to the co-offender, to take into account the lack of any criminal history to show that the offence in question was an uncharacteristic aberration and that there was little or no requirement for retribution, deterrence (specific or general) and protection of society.

38On the other hand, in the case of the applicant, the prior criminal record, for offences of the same kind, showed that retribution, deterrence and protection of society were significant factors to be taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence.

39In those circumstances, a significant discrepancy between the applicant and the co-offender is appropriate. Those factors alone would deny to the applicant an objectively determined justifiable sense of grievance with the disparity in sentences imposed.

40The applicant relies upon what is alleged to be an error in the understanding of the sentencing judge of the sentence imposed on the co-offender.

41In sentencing the co-offender, the sentencing judge, it is alleged, fixed the parity with the applicant on the basis that the applicant had been sentenced to the armed robbery offence to be served concurrently with the other offences.

42In sentencing the co-offender, the judge said:

""In Mr Lang's case his Honour ... imposed, for each of the two offences of break, enter and steal, fixed terms of 2 years imprisonment. The two fixed terms were partly accumulated so that, in effect, there was a sentence of 3 years for the break, enter and steal. Taking into account the other matters in sentencing Mr Lang for the armed robbery, his Honour sentenced him to 7 years imprisonment with a 3 year non-parole period. It is, as I said, important to take into account that Mr Lang [the applicant] had a very serious criminal record."" (Co-offender's ROS, 15 February 2012, [21] at page 8).

43His Honour then imposed the sentences and made the robbery offence wholly concurrent. In so doing, his Honour accumulated the two break, enter and steal offences by one month only (and did so deliberately) and imposed the sentence for the robbery so that it was wholly concurrent with the armed robbery offences. His Honour explained that approach when he said (ROS, [30] at page 11):

""I take into account, in making the aggravated break enter and steal sentences concurrent with the armed robbery offences, that Blanch J did the same in respect of the offender Lang.""

Later, after imposing the sentences, the sentencing judge addressed the co-offender in the following terms (ROS, [34] at page 12):

""Mr Reuter, you have got a gaol term as Mr Bruce realistically acknowledged. It is 3 ½ years, it is for the armed robbery and it takes into account the other break and enters and there is two sentences for the Joyce Mayne and the Switchboard. They run at the same time as that because the Judge sentencing Lang did the same so I have done the same there but I have given you a gaol term for the armed robbery because it is so serious and that gaol term is 3 ½ years and your minimum term is 1 year and 9 months which is half that. Normally a standard one would be 2 years and 7 months that you would have to stay in gaol but because of your age and your prospects of rehabilitation, then I have adjusted that to half so you will be eligible to be released in 1 year and 9 months from 27 January which, as I repeat, you will be eligible on 26 October 2013 do you understand that?""

44The applicant submits that the co-offender's sentencing judge fixed the co-offender's sentence on the basis of parity with the applicant on a basis which was mistaken, namely, that the robbery sentence was to be served concurrently with the two sentences for break, enter and steal. As a consequence, there is a disparity in the sentence.

45Sentencing is not a mathematical exercise. Properly understood, the applicant's submission is that he has a justifiable sense of grievance because the co-offender was sentenced, mistakenly, proportionate to a sentence that was not imposed upon the applicant. The effect of the applicant's submission is that he asks this Court to adjust his sentence so that, in effect, it would reflect the sentence that was mistakenly thought, by the co-offender's sentencing judge, to have been imposed on the applicant.

46The co-offender's sentencing judge overstated the level of concurrence in the applicant's sentence when he was dealing with the comparison. Nevertheless, there was still a significant degree of concurrence.

47As earlier stated, the accumulation as between the two aggravated break, enter and steal sentences was 12 months. Of the 3 year sentence imposed for the two break and enter offences, only 2 years of it was served cumulatively on the armed robbery offence, so that the overall sentence was for a period of 5 years non-parole period and a further period of 4 years in which he was eligible for parole. The sentence imposed on the applicant was cumulative on the 6-month sentence that he had been serving up until 1 June 2011.

48The co-offender was deliberately sentenced to a significantly less severe sentence than the applicant. That significantly less severe sentence was imposed for good reason.

49It is not clear, from the passage recited, that the sentencing judge, in sentencing the co-offender, misunderstood the overall sentence imposed on the applicant. He certainly misunderstood the degree of concurrency of individual sentences.

50Assuming, without deciding, that the sentencing judge, in sentencing the co-offender, misunderstood the overall sentence, it does not necessitate a finding that there is a justifiable sense of grievance or a breach of the parity principle.

51Sentencing is an intuitive process. The sentencing judge is required to synthesise a number of factors, some of which relate to goals that pull in different directions. Further, there is no one correct sentence and sentencing judges will differ as to the sentence to be imposed. Ultimately, the question must be whether the difference in sentence between the applicant and the co-offender gives rise, objectively, to a justifiable sense of grievance. The fact that the sentence was based on an incorrect understanding of the sentence imposed on the applicant does not alter the task of this Court.

52In my view, for the reasons I have already explained, and particularly for the leniency that was appropriate to be shown to the co-offender and the degree to which retribution and deterrence were significant factors in the case of the applicant, I do not consider that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance.

53For the foregoing reasons, I would propose that the Court makes the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted;

(2)Appeal dismissed.

54ADAMSON J: I agree with Rothman J.

2760975,"HAMMOND, Brian John v R [2013] NSWCCA 28","Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Rothman J.

2ROTHMAN J: Brian John Hammond, hereinafter the applicant, seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 14 October 2009. On that date, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 years, including a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.

3The foregoing sentence was imposed for the offence of aggravated assault with intent to take/drive motor vehicle (armed with an offensive weapon), contrary to s 154C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years' imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years' imprisonment. Pursuant to the terms of s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the District Court also dealt with a summary offence and sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of 9 months to be served wholly concurrently with the indictable offence. The charge dealt with under s 166 was a failure to submit to breath analysis.

Grounds of appeal

4The applicant was self-represented. The applicant raised two grounds of appeal, namely:

(i) ""I was not sentenced under the Mental Health Act"";

(ii) ""There was no finding of 'special or mitigating circumstances'.""

Circumstances of offence

5On 4 March 2009, the complainant was driving his Mazda car in Dubbo with friends. They pulled over and were speaking with a group of people whom they knew. The applicant was amongst that group. The applicant appeared intoxicated.

6The group asked for a lift. The applicant threatened to assault the complainant, physically, if the complainant did not give them a lift. The complainant agreed and the group got into the car, as the other passengers alighted. The applicant sat in the front seat and ordered the complainant to drive them to a park in East Dubbo. During the journey, the applicant continued to threaten the complainant.

7At the park, the passengers got out of the car. The applicant walked to the driver's door, opened the door and pulled the complainant out of the car. The applicant was holding a knife to the complainant's throat. One of the applicant's friends punched the complainant in the mouth. The applicant got in the driver's seat and drove off holding the knife to the complainant's stomach.

8The applicant's friends asked to get out of the car. The complainant could not leave the car, because the safety lock was engaged. The applicant received a phone call, during which call he said, ""I have some white boy's car and he's doing everything I say to do or I will kill him"". Later that day, the applicant was arrested. The police observed him to be well affected by drugs. The applicant refused to undertake a breath test.

Consideration of grounds of appeal

9Because the applicant is self-represented, I take a broader view of the first ground of appeal than might otherwise be appropriate. It seems that the applicant seeks to have the court find that his psychiatric condition was not appropriately taken into account by the sentencing judge. No occasion arises for the applicant to be sentenced under the Mental Health Act 2007.

10Psychiatric evidence was tendered to the sentencing judge. The evidence before the court was a report by Dr Allnutt dated 11 September 2009. I summarise Dr Allnutt's findings. The Aboriginal Legal Service (""ALS"") qualified Dr Allnutt on behalf of the applicant. The ALS represented the applicant on sentence.

11Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that when he saw the applicant:

""... he was not manifesting active symptoms of a significant psychiatric condition, that is, either a psychotic, mood or anxiety disorder.

He however did provide a history of long-term psychotic symptoms characterised by auditory hallucinations, referential ideas and persecutory delusions; he stated that he had previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia and on previous occasions had been prescribed Seroquel; while he had abused cannabis and alcohol from adolescence, he had only commenced using methamphetamines and amphetamines in August 2008; notwithstanding this, he described psychotic symptoms preceding that date; in my view, there would be reasonable grounds to be of the view that he likely suffers from a chronic psychotic disorder that occurs independent of substances but aggravated by substances such as a schizoaffective disorder or chronic paranoid schizophrenia.

He describes a long history of alcohol and cannabis abuse and more recently the abuse of amphetamines and methamphetamines consistent with a polysubstance abuse disorder and probable dependence which is currently in partial remission as a consequence of his incarceration.

He derives from difficult developmental circumstances; ...

I would not diagnose him however with a personality disorder.

He does not manifest any major medical problems...

The most significant stressor affecting him and which has been affecting him for the past two years has been separation from his children; ...

His functioning currently is adequate.

...

However in the absence of a clear account it is difficult to determine the relative contribution that the symptoms might have made to the offending; the alcohol and substances would have served as disinhibitors and probable aggravating factors with regard to his mental state; I am unable to provide any specific opinion with regard to the thought processes in relation to the offences and consequences of his actions because of his poor memory.

...

1.I believe your client is suitable for rehabilitation in particular drug and alcohol rehabilitation; in my view, the drug and alcohol rehabilitation should occur in a residential setting.

2.Your client should be referred to a psychiatrist; he has a chronic psychotic disorder and would benefit from psychiatric treatment.

3.Your client should abstain from the use of substances absolutely.""

12While it is possible, given the foregoing, that the applicant was suffering from some psychosis at the time of the commission of the offences, it could not be established, even on the balance of probabilities, that the psychosis had any effect on the commission of the offence or affected the applicant's decision-making at that time. Further, the foregoing establishes that at the time of sentencing the applicant was not affected by any psychosis in his behaviour or mental functioning.

13The applicant submits that evidence should have been adduced from a ""trained psychiatrist"", because that may have been more favourable than the opinion and recommendations of Dr Allnutt. No opinion is adduced on appeal to support the possibility of a more favourable outcome.

14To the extent that the ground of appeal raises the question of the competency of the efforts made on behalf of the applicant by his legal representative below, no relevant or appropriate criticism can be made of those efforts.

15The sentencing judge made extensive reference to Dr Allnutt's report and the pre-sentence report. His Honour was of the view that there was no ""real correlation between the circumstances of the offence and the offender's intoxication or ... mental situation"" (ROS 6). Such a finding was open to his Honour and is not challenged on appeal.

16As to the submission concerning the operation of the Mental Health Act, as already stated, there is no occasion, and was none at the time of sentencing, for the operation of Part 2 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.

17Further, as to the issues subsequently raised by the applicant regarding the quality or competence of his legal representation, an affidavit of his legal representative has been filed, being the legal representative representing the applicant at the Local Court, relating to fitness to be tried. The applicant's representative in the District Court attended Court during the appeal but was not questioned by either the applicant or the Crown. That representative did not provide an affidavit because of concerns relating to legal professional privilege, about which the applicant had not received independent advice.

18The transcript of the sentencing proceedings has been studied. There is no basis for a submission that it was conducted other than properly and competently. Further, there is no basis for suggesting that Dr Allnutt's opinion, qualified, as it was, by the ALS on behalf of the applicant, was any less helpful to the applicant then any other opinion would have been.

19The first ground of appeal, including any ground relating to the competence of the legal representative, must fail.

20The second ground of appeal relates to the absence of a finding as to special or mitigating circumstances. As earlier stated, the sentencing judge relied significantly upon the opinion of Dr Allnutt, which refers to the childhood of the applicant.

21The ""special circumstances"" to which reference is made are the circumstances warranting a longer period on parole than might otherwise be imposed. The sentence is significant and the period for which the applicant is eligible for parole is, likewise, significant. The material before the sentencing judge disclosed that there were no good prospects of rehabilitation, particularly in light of the applicant's age. Nevertheless, the applicant has 18 months during which rehabilitation can be effected and under which the applicant would be supervised. On the material before the Court below, and before this Court, that time period is sufficient time to effect the rehabilitation process to which Dr Allnutt refers.

22There is no warrant to interfere with the non-parole period imposed by the sentencing judge. It does not disclose error. Further, the absence of circumstances warranting a longer period of parole was recognised below, and no application was made for a finding of special circumstances. This Court in Ayoub and El Masri v R [2010] NSWCCA 196 held that a finding as to special circumstances was a matter of discretion and would be the subject of intervention by this Court only on one of the well-known bases for the overturning of an exercise of discretion. In the absence of a manifest requirement for a lengthier period of potential parole, it is not an error for a sentencing judge not to find special circumstances, particularly where the judge has not been requested to make such a finding.

23This ground of appeal must also fail.

24For the foregoing reasons, I propose that the Court make the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted;

(2)Appeal dismissed.

25BELLEW J: I agree with Rothman J.

2760998,Dean v Phung (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 116,"Judgment

Introduction

1By Notice of Motion filed on 25 October 2012 the plaintiff sought orders that:

""1. The Defendant pay the Plaintiff's costs of the Plaintiff's application to amend his Statement of Claim, heard by Deputy Registrar Howard on 14 October 2010.

2. The Defendant pay the Plaintiff interest, at the rate prescribed by Section 101 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005, on his costs the subject of the costs order of Hislop J made on 30 June 2011 as assessed or agreed from 3 August 2011 until payment of that interest.""

2The application arose in proceedings brought by the plaintiff to recover damages for dental injuries sustained whilst under the care of the defendant, a dentist.

3The background to the application is set out in the plaintiff's written submissions as follows:

""2. The trial of these proceedings first commenced before Johnson J, and proceeded together with an action brought by the workers compensation insurer of the plaintiff's former employer, in whose employ the plaintiff suffered the dental injuries which brought him under the care of the defendant. In its action, the workers compensation insurer was seeking to recover amounts paid to, for or on behalf of the plaintiff pursuant to its obligation under the Workers Compensation Act 1987, on the basis that, inter alia, the defendant had performed the dental work on the plaintiff for the purposes of financial gain rather than the plaintiff's therapeutic benefit.

3. During the course of the proceedings before Johnson J the defendant's senior counsel stated to the court that the defendant conceded that 'none of the treatment [he provided to the plaintiff] was reasonably necessary.'

4. When the plaintiff's proceedings against the defendant first came before Johnson J they were framed in contract and negligence. No allegation as to the commission of an intentional tort was made. During the course of the proceedings before Johnson J the defendant admitted liability to the plaintiff. As the proceedings before Johnson J were on the question of liability, only, the plaintiff withdrew, upon the admission being made, and the workers compensation insurer's proceedings continued.

5. Justice Johnson later took the view that he ought not to hear the plaintiff's case on damages, hence that aspect of the matter ultimately coming before your Honour.

6. On the strength of the defendant's admission before Johnson J, that none of the treatment had been reasonably necessary, the plaintiff brought an application to amend his pleading to plead the intentional tort of battery on the basis that any consent obtained by the defendant from the plaintiff to the performance of the dental procedures was vitiated by fraud.

7. The application to amend the pleading came before Assistant Registrar Howard on 14 October 2010. It was resisted by the defendant. Assistant Registrar Howard granted the leave sought and reserved the question of the costs of that application to the trial judge. Those reserved costs were not subsumed into the general costs order made by Your Honour when delivering judgment in the matter because the defendant requested that they be determined separately. The question as to who should pay the costs of the plaintiff's application to amend therefore remains undetermined.

8. None of the costs ordered by your Honour to be paid by the defendant have yet been paid. The plaintiff's costs and disbursements on a solicitor and client basis in the amount of $495,082.08 were paid by the plaintiff out of the proceeds of his verdict on 3 August 2011.""

4No transcript of the application before Assistant Registrar Howard is available. 

Evidence

5The defendant appeared in person to oppose the application. He sought to tender in evidence decisions of proceedings against him in the Dental Tribunal of New South Wales dated 18 May 2012 and 20 November 2012, photocopies of pages of textbooks, medical reports and a statement made by him to the Tribunal on 10 July 2012 dealing, inter alia, with his financial situation.

6The defendant submitted the documents should be admitted on the application as 

""... at the time of the Supreme Court proceedings all the evidence there is against me in regard to all the damage to Mr Dean. It looks like it has come from me ... but in the Dental Tribunal, which is all specialist tribunal, it find out I did not cause any damage to the temporomandibular joint ... all the damage to Mr Dean is from the temporomandibular joint and all the cost is to the temporomandibular joint, which was not caused by me. I was not the person who caused all the trouble to Mr Dean, it was the accident that caused him the damage and I do not understand why I have to pay for all those damages.""

7The tender of the documents, save for such of the medical reports as were in evidence in the principal proceedings and the defendant's statement (except paragraphs 27 to 30) was opposed by the plaintiff on the basis

""Dr Phung seeks to revisit matters which have already been determined by this Court, and in which Dr Phung imposes decisions of the Dental Tribunal of New South Wales, which, in my submission, are irrelevant to the matters your Honour must consider for the determination of this application..."" [The defendant] seeks to reopen matters which have been the subject of final determination by this Court. The question of costs per se only relates to costs of the application to amend. The application to amend did not have anything to do with the extent or nature of the damage but the characterisation of the defendant's acts for the purpose of determining whether the assessment of damages should be governed by the Civil Liability Act or be at large.

The second prayer in the Notice of Motion simply seeks interest in respect of the costs, based upon a costs order which was made by your Honour. To that extent that is the subject of a final determination. So on any view of it, in my submission, the reports have no relevance to any matters in issue on this application.""

8I upheld the plaintiff's submissions and rejected the tender of the documents save for the plaintiff's statement (excluding paragraphs 27 to 30).

The costs of the amendment

9The defendant submitted that the application to amend was an indulgence in respect of which he should not be burdened with further costs. 

10The plaintiff submitted:

'13. In circumstances where a plaintiff seeks to amend his pleading on the basis of material already available, or reasonably available, to him at the time the original pleading was filed, courts will frequently order him to pay the costs of the application on the basis that he is being granted an ""indulgence"". This is not such a case. The basis of the plaintiff's application to amend, ultimately being the basis of his success in the Court of Appeal, was the concession which came from the defendant, through his counsel, in the proceedings before Johnson J. The plaintiff's decision, on the basis of that admission, to seek to amend his claim was not only appropriate, but correct. The defendant's concessions, at the commencement of the trial before your Honour, only go to demonstrate that the plaintiff's application to amend ought never to have been resisted. The costs of the motion ought follow the event. As Gleeson CJ said in Ohn v. Walton (1995) 36 NSWLR 77 at 79: 

The usual rationale of making a costs order is that it is just and reasonable that the successful party should be reimbursed for costs incurred, in the absence of grounds connected with the charge or conduct of the proceedings which make it unjust or unreasonable that there should be such reimbursement.

14. To similar effect is McHugh J's statement of principle in Oshlack v Richmond River Council (1998) 193 CLR 72 at [69]. As already noted, the principle is given statutory force by UCPR 42.1. 

15. In the plaintiff's respectful submission, there is nothing in the plaintiff's conduct of the proceedings which makes it unjust or unreasonable that he should receive reimbursement for the costs incurred by him in bringing his application to amend.'

11In my opinion the appropriate order, in the exercise of my discretion, is that each party bear his own costs of the plaintiff's application to amend for the following reasons:

a) the original statement of claim was filed on 18 December 2008. It pleaded, inter alia, the following particulars of breach in paragraphs 10 and 11:
""e) Providing dental and related treatment which was not required.

(f) Advising the plaintiff to undergo treatment which he did not require. ""

and continued:

""12. The treatment was performed without the plaintiff giving his informed consent and was an assault and battery and trespass to the person of the plaintiff. 

13. By reason of the aforesaid breaches of contract and/or negligence and/or assault and battery and trespass to the person of the plaintiff by the defendant, the plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injury, loss and damage.""

b) these allegations were essentially maintained in the subsequent statement of claim,

c) part of the amendment related to a claim for aggravated damages which was not pressed,

d) the plaintiff's legal representatives were aware that the workers compensation insurer was asserting the defendant had performed the dental work on the plaintiff for the purpose of financial gain rather than the plaintiffs therapeutic benefit,

f) at the trial the plaintiff failed on the amended claim but this was reversed on appeal. The matter involved a degree of complexity. It was not inappropriate for the defendant to oppose the application for amendment,

g) these circumstances, in the usual course, would be likely to attract a costs order against the plaintiff on the basis he was seeking an indulgence- Ritchie's Uniform Civil Procedure (NSW) s 64.5, s 64.45, r 42.1.25, 42.7.15, para 10(13) above,

h) however as the plaintiff ultimately succeeded in the Court of Appeal on the pleading as ultimately pressed, and having regard to UCPR 42.1 and 42.7, the appropriate order, in my opinion, is that each party bear his own costs.

The interest claim

12The Civil Procedure Act 2005 provides 

""101(4) The court may order that interest is to be paid on any amount payable under an order for the payment of costs.
101(5) interest under subsection (4) is to be calculated, at the prescribed rate or at such other rate as the court may order, as from: 
(a) the date or dates on which the costs concerned were paid, or
(b) such later date as the court may order.""

13The purpose of an award of interest on costs is to compensate a successful litigant for having been out of pocket for legal costs that would otherwise have earned interest or been used in a commercial enterprise - see the cases summarised by Einstein J in Australian Development Corporation Pty Limited v White Constructions (ACT) Pty Limited [2002] NSWSC 280. 

14There is no requirement on the applicant to show a ""special"" case - Australian Development Corporation Pty Limited at [23]-[28]; Grogan v Thiess Contractors Pty Limited [2000] NSWSC 1101 at [10], Puntoriero v Water Administration Ministerial Corporation [2002] NSWSC 217 at [10] or to demonstrate that the circumstances of the case are ""out of the ordinary"" - Lahoud v Lahoud [2006] NSWSC 126 at [82]; Davies v Kuring-gai Municipal Council [2003] NSWSC 1010 at [7].

15The defendant submitted, essentially, that it would be unjust to award interest on costs against him as his financial position was parlous, he was unrepresented and it was unclear whether an insurer would cover the interest claimed.

16The plaintiff submitted that the fact the defendant was unrepresented and that it was unclear whether an insurer would cover the interest claimed was irrelevant. 

17As to the defendants alleged impecuniosity the plaintiff submitted:

a) The defendant's capacity to pay interest is irrelevant to whether or not an order for its payment should be made because of the compensatory purpose of such an order. 

b) If capacity to pay is relevant, any difficulty the defendant will have in meeting an order in respect of interest should militate in favour of the making of such an order, having regard to the almost inevitable consequent delay in the payment of the costs on which that interest is sought. 

c) The evidence before the Court does not establish that the defendant is incapable of meeting a costs order or an order that interest be paid on those costs. This is because the evidence is silent as to the defendant's total asset position. There is a possibility an insurer may be liable to pay the costs and interest.

d) The plaintiff has sought assessment of the costs. The assessment has not yet been completed. There have been lengthy but unsuccessful attempts to agree on costs. However no significant delay in the plaintiff's pursuit of the costs order has occurred and it was reasonable to endeavour to resolve such matters by consent rather than to proceed immediately to an assessment resulting in additional costs being incurred.

e) The plaintiff has been out of pocket in a substantial sum since 3 August 2011. The plaintiff should be entitled to interest on costs from that date. 

18I accept the plaintiff's submissions. In my opinion it is appropriate to exercise the discretion in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the award of interest.

Costs

19The costs of the application before the Court were not sought in the Notice of Motion filed on 25 October 2012. Counsel for the plaintiff dealt with this when opening his case. He said 'I should state at the outset that there should have been an additional prayer that the applicant seeks the costs of this motion in the event that he is successful.' Costs need not be specifically claimed in a notice of motion (UCPR 18.3(2)) though it is advisable to do so when a respondent is unrepresented. As both parties enjoyed a degree of success on the application, in my opinion the appropriate order for the costs of the Notice of Motion filed on 25 October 2012 is that each party bear his own costs. 

Orders

20I make the following Orders:

(a) Each party to bear his own costs of the plaintiff's application to amend his Statement of Claim, heard by Deputy Registrar Howard on 14 October 2010.

(b) The defendant pay the plaintiff interest, at the rate prescribed by s 101 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005, on the costs the subject of the costs order of Hislop J made on 30 June 2011 as assessed or agreed from 3 August 2011 until payment.

(c) Each party to bear his own costs of the Notice of Motion filed on 25 October 2012.

2760999,"DIEP, Danny v R [2013] NSWCCA 39","Judgment

1McClellan JA: I agree with Hidden J.

2Hidden J: After a plea of guilty in the Local Court, the applicant, Danny Tunduc Diep, was committed for sentence in the District Court for the offence of robbery with the intentional infliction of actual bodily harm, an offence under s 95(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. Bennett DCJ sentenced him to imprisonment for 4 years and 9 months, comprising a non-parole period of 2 ½ years and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months, commencing on the date of his arrest, 3 May 2011. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 

Facts 

3The applicant had a gambling addiction. Late in the evening of Monday 1 May 2011, he and a co-offender, Albert Bao-An Phan, went to the Canterbury/Hurlstone Park RSL Club, where they played the gaming machines until the small hours of the morning of 2 May. From there they went to the Wests/Ashfield Club at Ashfield. They played one of the poker machines at that club. They observed the victim playing another machine, saw that he had several thousand dollars in credit, and discussed robbing him.

4About an hour and a half later they followed the victim to the cashier area and saw him collect cash in an amount in excess of $2,000. They left the club and waited in the car park area. They saw the victim get in to a car and drive off, and they followed him in Phan's car.

5The victim drove to a unit complex in Elizabeth Street Ashfield, where he lived. The applicant and Phan followed him into the unit block, and to his unit on the third floor. As the victim was about to unlock his front door, he was seized around his throat and punched repeatedly to the face and head. He fell to the ground, screaming for help. The applicant and Phan searched him, took the money he had, and returned to Phan's car. They drove to a McDonald's outlet in Stanmore, where they bought some food and washed blood from their hands. They then travelled to Star City Casino, and used the victim's money to gamble there. 

6The victim's partner found him where he had fallen, and called police and ambulance. He was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, where he was found to have a fracture of the left nasal bone (causing deviation of the nose to the right), a fracture to the right medial orbit wall and soft tissue hematoma through the right frontal system. He was discharged from hospital later that day, but returned on 9 May 2011 for surgery during which a closed reduction of his nasal bones was performed. He was discharged later that same day.

7The applicant and Phan were arrested on 3 May 2011. Phan made an admission of having robbed a man in company with the applicant but, having been taken to Fairfield Police Station, he declined to participate in an electronically recorded interview. The applicant agreed to be interviewed, and made significant admissions. In particular, he admitted that at the Ashfield club they had been ""watching people's credits"" and that, when they saw the victim's credit, they discussed robbing him because they had both been losing. He admitted that they had followed the victim to his home, where they had assaulted him. He described his memory of the assault as ""a bit fuzzy"", but said that both of them had participated in it, using their hands. He added that both of them searched the victim for his money while he was lying on the floor.

8In assessing the gravity of the offence, Judge Bennett judge found as aggravating features that there had been ""a degree of planning and organisation"", and that the victim was vulnerable because of the time of day and the location where the attack occurred, together with the fact that he was alone. He noted that the victim was given no opportunity to surrender his money but was immediately set upon. 

Plea/Assistance

9As I have said, the applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court. On the evidence in the sentence proceedings, his Honour found him to be genuinely remorseful. He noted that he had readily admitted his role in the offence and had ""not sought to avoid responsibility for having taken part in the planning, the execution, and the attack upon this vulnerable victim"". 

10At the time the applicant was sentenced, Phan was yet to be dealt with. Apart from disclosing the conduct of Phan and himself in the recorded interview, the applicant had agreed to give evidence against Phan. For his assistance to the authorities in this respect and his early plea of guilty, his Honour allowed a combined discount of sentence of 40%, of which 15% was referable to the assistance. It was from a starting point of 8 years imprisonment that his Honour arrived at the discounted figure of 4 years and 9 months. As is apparent, in specifying a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months his Honour found special circumstances. 

Subjective case 

11The applicant was 20 years old at the time of the offence, and is now 21. He has no prior convictions. His family background is unremarkable, his Honour noting that his parents provided him with ""a caring and loving environment."" He has three brothers, and no one in his family had been involved in criminal activity. He completed his secondary education and had commenced a university course. He had been consistently employed in a variety of positions. Testimonials in evidence described him as a willing worker, active in his community, and as a courteous, reliable and diligent young man.

12However, from about the age of 18 he had developed what his Honour described as a ""major and recurrent"" gambling problem. He gambled in various forms, developing a pattern where he would exhaust his available funds, withdraw from gambling for a short time to recoup his losses, and then return to it. He was said to have had periods of depression during times when he suffered gambling losses. In the light of the whole of the subjective material his Honour observed:

""He is an articulate and intelligent young man. It is a tragedy of mammoth proportion that he has placed himself in his present predicament.""

13His Honour was not persuaded that the applicant's gambling addiction mitigated his offence, but he saw in it some explanation for his conduct and found that it provided ""a scope for assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation."" His Honour accepted those prospects to be ""strong"", finding that there was ""little prospect of him committing further offences in the light of the experience he had gained from this."" 

Co-offender

14Phan subsequently pleaded guilty to the same offence and was sentenced by Sides DCJ. His case on sentence was that he did not participate in the assault on the victim, which was perpetrated by the applicant only. Judge Sides sentenced him on that basis, while noting that he did nothing to assist the victim and took advantage of the situation by joining with the applicant in the removal of the victim's money, driving the two of them from the scene and sharing the proceeds.

15Phan is only a few months younger than the applicant. He did not have a clear criminal history, having been convicted in June 2010 of two counts of larceny as a servant, for which he was ordered to perform community service. Otherwise, his subjective case was similar to the applicant's. He had a satisfactory upbringing, had completed his Higher School Certificate and had embarked upon a university course. However, he also had developed a gambling problem. His Honour found him to be remorseful, and concluded that his prospects of rehabilitation were ""very good"". He allowed a 25% reduction of sentence for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty.

16Judge Sides had Judge Bennett's remarks on sentence. His Honour noted the similarities in the cases of the two offenders, but also the differences between them. He observed that the applicant had no prior criminal history and had received an additional discount of sentence of 15% for his assistance to the authorities. He also noted that the applicant was sentenced on the basis that he was not the sole perpetrator of the violence upon the victim. This, of course, was not his approach to the sentence of Phan, so that he saw the applicant's criminality as ""somewhat greater"" than Phan's ""because he was the actual perpetrator of the corporal violence ... ."" 

17Phan was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. While his Honour did not specify his starting point for sentence, it must have been 5 years and 8 months.

The application

18Counsel for the applicant, Mr Russell, relied on a number of grounds of the application. For the most part these amounted to particulars of a general submission that the sentence is manifestly excessive. It was put that the sentence failed to give adequate weight to the applicant's age, his gambling addiction, his remorse, his plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities, and his prospects of rehabilitation. It was also put that the offence was ""principally opportunistic"", and that Judge Bennett was in error in characterising it as involving a degree of planning and organisation.

19It is clear from his remarks that his Honour had regard to all those subjective features. As to the objective gravity of the offence, to describe it as ""opportunistic"" does not alter the fact that it was by no means spontaneous. It may have lacked professionalism, but it was clearly open to his Honour to conclude that it involved a degree of planning. 

20All that said, given the applicant's youth and favourable subjective case, while having regard to the undoubted seriousness of the offence, the starting point of 8 years imprisonment is high. However, I find it unnecessary to determine whether the sentence is manifestly excessive because I am persuaded that the remaining ground of the application, challenging the relativity of the applicant's sentence with that passed upon Phan, is made out. The intervention of this court on that basis, in my view, is an appropriate and sufficient way to ensure justice to the applicant.

21The two offenders were sentenced on different factual bases. This is yet another case emphasising the importance of co-offenders being dealt with by the same judge. That said, while allowing for the fact that Phan was sentenced on the basis that he did not participate in the violence inflicted upon the victim, the difference in the starting point of sentence for the two men is marked: 8 years in the case of the applicant, and 6 years and 8 months in the case of Phan. Even if Phan did not inflict any violence upon the victim, he was, of course, criminally responsible for it as a participant in the joint criminal enterprise. Accepting that some difference in the starting points was justified on that basis, the extent of the difference cannot be sustained. 

22In the event, the sentence of 4 years and 3 months passed upon Phan was 6 months less than the applicant's, and Phan's non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months was less than the applicant's by 3 months. Unlike the applicant, Phan did not have the benefit of a clear criminal history and, unlike the applicant, he had not provided assistance to the authorities, a course which earned the applicant an additional 15% reduction of sentence. In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the proportionality between the two sentences is such as to engender in the applicant a justifiable sense of grievance which this court should set right.

23That said, the gravity of the offence is such that only a relatively modest reduction of sentence would be appropriate. I would set a starting point of sentence at 6 ½ years imprisonment. Maintaining Judge Bennett's discount for the applicant's plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities, that term would be reduced to a little under 3 years and 11 months. I would round that off at 4 years. Also maintaining his Honour's finding of special circumstances, I would set a non-parole period of 2 years. 

24Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would quash the sentence passed in the District Court and, in lieu, would sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing on 3 May 2011 and expiring on 2 May 2013, and a balance of term of 2 years, commencing on 3 May 2013 and expiring on 2 May 2015.

2761004,"SMART, Gary v R [2013] NSWCCA 37","Judgment

1McClellan JA: I agree with Hidden J.

2Hidden J: The applicant, Gary Smart, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a number of firearms offences, and had a number of further firearms offences taken into account on a Form 1. The charges to which he pleaded guilty were the following:

2 charges of manufacturing a sub-machine gun, an offence under s 50A(2) of the Firearms Act 1996, carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment (sequences 1 and 30);

unauthorised possession of the sub-machine gun the subject of sequence 1, an offence under s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996, carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 3 years (sequence 3);

unauthorised possession of a .22 calibre Stirling self-loading rifle, another offence under s 7(1) of the Firearms Act (sequence 6);

unauthorised possession of a .410 calibre pistol, yet another offence under s 7(1) of the Firearms Act (sequence 10);

unauthorised possession of 7 pistol magazines, an offence under s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, also carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 3 years (sequence 14);

unauthorised possession of a silencer, a further offence under s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act (sequence 27).

On the Form 1 were 7 offences of possessing an unregistered firearm (s 
36(1) of the Firearms Act) and 16 offences of not keeping a firearm safely (s 39(1)(a) of the Act).

3The applicant was sentenced to terms aggregating imprisonment for 12 ½ years, with an effective non-parole period of 7 ½ years, dating from the day of his arrest, 10 December 2009. He seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. The individual sentences, and the structure of them, will be better understood after a summary of the facts.

Facts 

4In September 2009 police set up a task force to investigate the manufacture of machine guns. On 10 December 2009 a search warrant was executed at the applicant's home at Blacktown. He admitted that he had illegal guns at his home and that he had manufactured a sub-machine gun. 

5In a shed at the back of the house, which was locked, police found various items used in the manufacture of a sub-machine gun. In a vice on a workbench they found a partially assembled sub-machine gun attached to a magazine (sequence 1). Also found were documents containing instructions and plans relating to the non-commercial manufacture of sub-machine guns, together with hand drawn diagrams of a weapon similar to that which was located in the vice. The applicant was not authorised by licence to possess that sub-machine gun (sequence 3). He admitted to police having test fired the weapon, using .45 calibre ammunition, and showed police an area in the backyard where he had done so.

6Also found in the shed were the Stirling rifle (sequence 6) and the .410 calibre pistol (sequence 10), 7 pistol magazines (sequence 14) and the silencer (sequence 27). The .410 calibre pistol was classified as a prohibited pistol, because it was of a calibre greater than .38 and had a barrel less than the minimum length prescribed under the Firearms Act. The applicant did not have a licence to possess any of these items. 

7The 7 offences of possessing an unregistered firearm on the Form 1 related to the sub-machine gun and the Stirling rifle, together with 4 other rifles and a shotgun which were also found at the premises. The 16 charges on the Form 1 of not keeping a firearm safely related to those 7 weapons, together with other rifles which, apparently, were licenced.

8In phone calls intercepted by police on the day before the search, it emerged that the applicant had manufactured another sub-machine gun (sequence 30), which he had given to a co-offender, Nick Andropoloulos. A person known as Paul wanted to buy two firearms from the offender. The applicant asked Andropoloulos to return the weapon so that he could sell it to Paul (or to someone else through Paul as an intermediary). Police found that sub-machine gun at the premises of Andropoloulos at Cranebrook. They noted that both sub-machine guns were strikingly similar, having the same design and having apparently been manufactured by similar techniques. 

9In a recorded interview with the police, the applicant said that he might have sold the machine gun found in the shed, although he declined to say to whom he would have sold it and said he had no idea for how much. He told police that he was a trained fitter and machinist, and that firearms had long been a hobby of his. He said that he had no purpose in manufacturing machine guns except as a hobby. 

10The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. He said that Andropoloulos was to pay him $1,000 for the machine gun he gave him, but he never received the money. It also emerged that he had test fired both machine guns shortly before his arrest. He had test fired the weapon found in the shed just before partially disassembling it, and the sentencing judge inferred that he was intending to do further work upon it to refine it. He had obtained the 7 magazines which police found to make machine guns, causing his Honour to observe that the two offences the subject of sequences 1 and 30 could not attract leniency ""on the basis of being an isolated aberration."" His Honour also noted that both weapons were relatively small, so as to be readily concealed. This he described as ""one feature that would make them attractive to those engaged in illegal activities such as armed robberies and home invasions, to mention but two."" 

11It was the applicant's case on sentence, enunciated in his evidence and in the history he supplied to a forensic psychologist, that he was under pressure from Andropoloulos to make sub-machine guns. As to the weapon he had supplied to Andropoloulos, he claimed that he believed that he wanted it for protection. He said that Andropoloulos was associated with an outlaw motorcycle gang, that he believed him to be dangerous, and that he feared possible harm to himself and his family if he did not comply with his wishes. 

12His Honour rejected this account for reasons he supplied in detailed remarks on sentence. He expressed himself to be satisfied that the applicant manufactured the machine guns ""as part of a small scale business to make and sell about 7 such items and not in response to pressure from his co-offender."" He noted that the applicant had given the sub-machine gun to Andropoloulos in the expectation that he would be paid for it and found that, when he was not paid, he asked Andropoloulos to return it because he expected to be able to sell it, along with the weapon found in his shed, to the man Paul. He was satisfied that the applicant's manufacture of the 2 weapons and his possession of the one found in the shed ""were premeditated offences committed so that he could earn money by employing his skills for illegitimate purposes."" 

13In his remarks his Honour quoted the following passage from the statement of facts:

""The sub-machine guns being manufactured by the offender at the time of his arrest are classed as 'prohibited firearms' by the Firearms Act NSW. Sub-machine guns typically only have military and law enforcement applications. Sub-machine guns are classified as prohibited firearms due to their devastating firing capabilities. Such firearms are designed to fire multiple rounds through a single depression of the trigger. It is the experience of Detectives from the Firearms & Organised Crime Squad that firearms such as these are highly sought after and prized by members of organised criminal groups.

The two sub-machine guns manufactured by the offender were chambered in .45ACP. This is a high calibre pistol round that carries massive amounts of energy relative to other pistol rounds. In NSW, pistols alone chambered in calibres in excess of .38 or 9mm are classified as prohibited pistols due to their devastating ballistic capabilities."" 

The sentences

14His Honour concluded that some accumulation of sentence was called for. He noted that the offence of unauthorised possession of the sub-machine gun found in the shed (sequence 3) was ""inexorably connected"" with the offence of manufacturing that weapon (sequence 1), calling for a concurrent sentence. He had taken into account the unauthorised possession of the 7 magazines (sequence 14) in determining the criminality of the two manufacturing offences (sequences 1 and 30), and decided that the sentence for sequence 14 should also be concurrent with other sentences. He determined that had the offences of unauthorised possession of the Stirling rifle (sequence 6) and of the silencer (sequence 27) stood alone, he would have passed suspended sentences in respect of them and, for that reason, concluded that the sentences for those two offences should also be concurrent with other sentences. As will be seen, he also passed a concurrent sentence for the possession of the .410 calibre pistol (sequence 10). 

15The sentences imposed, then, were as follows:

Sequences 6 and 27 (rifle and silencer): fixed terms of 12 months, commencing on 10 December 2009. 

Sequence 14 (magazines): fixed term of 21 months, also commencing on 10 December 2009.

Sequence 10 (.410 pistol): 34 months with a non-parole period of 18 months, again commencing on 10 December 2009.

Sequence 3 (possession of sub-machine gun): 4 years with a non-parole period of 27 months, commencing on 10 June 2010. 

Sequence 30 (manufacture sub-machine gun): 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years, also commencing on 10 June 2010.

Sequence 1 (manufacture sub-machine gun), taking into account the matters on the Form 1: 10 years with a non-parole period of 5 years, commencing on 10 June 2012.

16It will be seen that the sentences for sequences 3 and 30 were accumulated upon the previous sentences to the extent of 6 months. The sentence for sequence 1, which also had to reflect the criminality of the Form 1 matters, was accumulated by a further 2 years. The aggregate sentence, as I have said, was 12 ½ years with a non-parole period of 7 ½ years.

Subjective case 

17The applicant was 43 years old at the time of the offences, and is now 45. He had a minor matter on his criminal history which is of no significance, and his Honour treated him as a first offender. He and his sister were adopted. His personal background was unexceptional, and his employment history creditable. Indeed, while in custody he had been working in responsible positions. His Honour noted his extensive voluntary work with sporting clubs and his assistance to his parents, both of whom had significant health problems.

18He was married and fathered a son, but the marriage ended in 2001. At the time of his arrest he had been maintaining regular contact with his son and meeting his financial obligations to him. He had a second relationship with a woman who had mental health and substance abuse problems. That relationship ended in 2007. He had set up his own business, but it failed and caused him financial hardship. 

19His Honour received a report from Mr Sam Borenstein, psychologist, who concluded that at the time of the offences the applicant was suffering ""an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood consequent to the failure of his marriage, failure of a business venture, and financial hardship associated with same, and the failure of his second relationship ..."" This report is the subject of the first ground of the application.

20His Honour noted that the applicant had co-operated with police by making admissions, and found that he was entitled to an additional measure of leniency because of a matter attracting the operation of s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. For that matter, and in recognition of the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty, he allowed a reduction of sentence of 27.5%. In the light of all the evidence, and notwithstanding his findings about the applicant's criminality, his Honour concluded that his prospects of rehabilitation and of not re-offending were good. 

The application

21Counsel for the applicant, Mr Brady, argued the application on two bases: that his Honour failed to have adequate regard to the evidence of the applicant's psychological condition, and that the sentences are manifestly excessive. 

Psychological evidence

22I have set out above the conclusion of Mr Borenstein, the psychologist, that at the time of the offences the applicant was suffering from an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. In addition to the stressors in his life arising from the breakdown of his relationships and his financial difficulties, Mr Borenstein noted the death in 1990 of the applicant's maternal grandfather, with whom he had developed a bond from a very early age. In the light of the history he obtained and the applicant's account of the offences, Mr Borenstein expressed this opinion:

""Mr Smart's judgment at the time of the offence was impaired by virtue of his chronically depressed and anxious state, following sustaining significant losses, which activated core attachment difficulties, the result of his adopted status and losing the only man in his life with whom he felt close, namely his maternal grandfather in 1990.""

23In his evidence the applicant attested to the truth of the history he had provided to Mr Borenstein. Mr Borenstein reported that he continued to suffer symptoms of depression while in custody, and the applicant gave evidence that he had not had any professional intervention for his condition within the prison system and was confined to twice weekly discussions with a chaplain. 

24As I have said, his Honour rejected the applicant's account of the circumstances of his involvement in the offences. In his remarks he referred to Mr Borenstein's opinion that the applicant's judgment was impaired at the relevant time and subjected it to critical analysis in the light of his own findings. This led his Honour to observe:

""... there is no credible evidence justifying a conclusion that, at the time of committing any of the seven offences, the offender did not know what he was doing or did not fully appreciate the consequences of his conduct."" 

25For the purpose of the application Mr Brady accepted his Honour's findings about the applicant's involvement, and his conclusion that he knew what he was doing and appreciated the consequences of his conduct. He submitted, however, that that conclusion still leaves room for an assessment of the bearing of the applicant's psychological condition on the sentencing process. In particular, he argued, the fact that the applicant was aware of the nature and consequences of his actions did not necessarily mean that his judgment was not impaired. 

26He relied on a passage from the judgment of Simpson J, with whom Hunt AJA and Rothman J agreed, in Benitez v R [2006] NSWCCA 21, 160 A Crim R 166, at [33] - [42], in which her Honour reviewed authorities on the bearing of mental illness on sentence. Relevantly to the issue in that case, she emphasised that for mental illness to have such a bearing it was not necessary to show that it was the cause, or even a cause, of the commission of the crime. The error identified in the approach of the sentencing judge was his conclusion that the offender's depressive illness was irrelevant to the sentencing process because it was not causative of his offences. 

27Her Honour noted that mental illness may bear on the weight to be given to general and specific deterrence, as well as considerations of rehabilitation. In fact, her Honour found that the offender's illness did have some bearing upon the commission of the offences but, because he ""acted with knowledge of what he was doing and of the gravity of his actions"", it was a matter which could not ""weigh too heavily"", citing the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL (as he then was) in R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 51: see her Honour's judgment at [41] - [42].

28In the present case his Honour accepted that the applicant suffered the condition which Mr Borenstein identified. What his Honour found, however, was that it had no bearing upon his commission of these crimes. Plainly enough, Mr Borenstein's opinion was influenced by the applicant's account of the circumstances of his offending, an account which his Honour found to be sanitised. His Honour's conclusion was well open to him. 

29His Honour also decided that the offences required ""particular weight to be given to general deterrence."" That view was also open, notwithstanding the applicant's psychological condition, given his Honour's finding about the nature of his criminality. As he noted towards the end of his remarks, the applicant ""was motivated by profit."" As to specific deterrence, his Honour's finding was favourable to the applicant. 

30None of this is to say that the applicant's psychological condition was ignored in the sentencing process. Clearly, his Honour took it into account as part of his subjective case and, in particular, found that his continuing symptoms of depression were ""likely to make his time in custody more burdensome."" His Honour's approach to this issue was consistent with the authorities, conveniently summarised by McClellan CJ at CL in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, 79 NSWLR 1, at [177].

31An important case on this issue, to which Simpson J referred in Benitez, is R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. It is pertinent to repeat some observations of Gleeson CJ, with whom Allen and Sully JJ agreed, in that case. His Honour said (at 71) that ""the question of the relationship, if any, between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence, goes to the circumstances of the individual case to be taken into account in the application of the relevant principles."" One of those principles had been enunciated by his Honour a little earlier in the judgment (at 68):

""It is ... erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances. In every case, what is called for is the making of a discretionary decision in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, and in the light of the purposes to be served by the sentencing exercise.""

32This ground of appeal is not made out.

Manifestly excessive?

33Mr Brady submitted that the individual sentences are excessive, as is the aggregate sentence. In his written submissions he set out a table showing the starting point of the sentence (rounded off) for each offence before the 27.5% reduction to which I have referred. It is unnecessary to set out the figures in relation to the fixed term sentences for sequences 6 (.22 rifle), 27 (silencer) and 14 (magazines). However, the figures for the remaining offences should be noted:

sequence 10 (.410 pistol): starting point of 47 months (discounted sentence 34 months);

sequence 3 (possession of sub-machine gun in shed): starting point of 5 ½ years (discounted sentence 4 years);

sequence 30 (manufacture sub-machine gun - Andropoloulos): starting point of 11 years (discounted sentence 8 years);

sequence 1 (manufacture sub-machine gun in shed) with Form 1 matters: starting point of 13 years and 9 months (discounted sentence 10 years).

The aggregate sentence of 12 ½ years with a non-parole period of 7 ½ years would be derived from a starting point of 17 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 10 years and 4 months.

34Plainly enough, the longest sentences are those for manufacturing the sub-machine guns, and it is those offences which led to the larger measure of accumulation. It appears that there are no Judicial Commission statistics in respect of sentence for that offence, and counsel could refer us to no decision of this court dealing with it. This may well be the first time the court has encountered it.

35Mr Brady acknowledged the seriousness of the offences, but submitted that the sentences for them, both individually and in their aggregate, failed to give adequate weight to the applicant's favourable subjective case which I have outlined. This, of course, included the fact that he was a mature man of prior good character who, his Honour found, was remorseful and unlikely to re-offend, and who faced more burdensome conditions of custody because of his psychological condition. 

36Nevertheless, the whole pattern of offending revealed by the committal charges and the Form 1 matters was very serious. Particularly was this so of the manufacture of the two sub-machine guns. On his Honour's findings, these were destined for sale and, if they had been sold, there would have been delivered into hands of members of the community, probably the criminal fraternity, two extremely dangerous weapons. Moreover, as his Honour also found, if the applicant had not been apprehended, more weapons of that kind would have been manufactured and sold. Of course, the applicant stood for sentence for no more than two charges of manufacturing sub-machine guns but, as his Honour observed, they could not be characterised as an isolated aberration.

37The sentences for the two offences of manufacturing sub-machine guns must be viewed against a maximum sentence for each of them of 20 years imprisonment (with no standard non-parole period). The maximum sentences for each of the other offences is 14 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 3 years. The 10 year sentence for the manufacturing of a sub-machine gun the subject of sequence 1, derived from a starting point of almost 14 years, is undoubtedly high, but the sentence for that offence had to embrace the criminality of the Form 1 matters. It was accumulated by 2 years upon the 8 year sentence, derived from a starting point of 11 years, for the other manufacturing offence (sequence 30), so that the latter sentence was largely subsumed within the former. 

38The 4 year sentence for possession of the sub-machine gun at the shed (sequence 3) was wholly subsumed within the sentence for sequence 30, and was accumulated by only 6 months upon the 34 month sentence for possession of the .410 pistol (sequence 10). The fixed terms of imprisonment for the remaining offences were wholly subsumed within the sentence for that pistol offence.

39A finding of special circumstances led to a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period for the sentences in respect of sequences 1, 3, 10 and 30, with a marked reduction of the proportion for the two manufacturing offences: in each case a non-parole period of 5 years. That generous allowance for special circumstances is also reflected in the aggregate sentence. 

40The sentencing judge was confronted with a very difficult task, particularly determining the appropriate sentences in the uncharted territory of the offence of manufacturing a sub-machine gun. The case was made the more difficult by the need to balance the gravity of the offences against the applicant's favourable subjective case. The sentencing outcome is undoubtedly severe but, after careful reflection, I am not persuaded that it was beyond the bounds of the proper exercise of his Honour's discretion. This ground is not made out.

41I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

42Adamson J: I agree with Hidden J.

1McClellan CJ at CL: I agree with Button J.

2Garling J: I agree with the judgment of Button J.

3Button J: This is a series of appeals and applications for leave to appeal against sentence that were heard together. The position is complicated by the fact that in the case of Mr Truong there is an application for leave to appeal against sentence by the offender, but no Crown appeal; in the case of Mr Nguyen there is an application for leave to appeal against sentence by the offender and a Crown appeal against sentence; and in the case of Mr Le there is a Crown appeal against sentence, but no application for leave to appeal against sentence by the offender. For ease of comprehension, I shall not refer to the offenders as applicants or respondents, but rather by name. 

Morgan Truong v R

Offences

4Mr Truong was sentenced by Judge Lakatos SC in the District Court of New South Wales on 5 August 2011. He pleaded guilty to two offences. The second of those contained four matters on a Form 1. 

5The first offence was knowingly take part in the sale of a prohibited firearm, namely a Bruni pistol. That was an offence against s 51(1A) of the Firearms Act 1996. The offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years.

6The second offence was knowingly take part in the sale of a prohibited pistol, namely a .25 calibre Melior pistol. Again, that was an offence against s 51(1A) of the Firearms Act. It also attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years.

7As indicated, four offences were contained on a Form 1 and to be taken into account with count two. The first was offering to take part in the sale of a pistol to a person unauthorised to possess it, namely a 9mm Beretta self-loading pistol. That offence was brought pursuant to s 51(1A) of the Firearms Act, and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years.

8There were two offences of selling ammunition without seeing a buyer's license or permit. Those two offences were brought pursuant to s 65(1) of the Firearms Act, and carried a maximum penalty of a $5,500 fine. 

9The fourth and final offence on the Form 1 was conspiracy to knowingly take part in the supply of firearms, namely pistols. That was a common law offence with no maximum penalty. (It is noteworthy that s 51C of the Firearms Act creates an offence of conspiring to commit an offence against the Firearms Act in any place outside of New South Wales and imposes a maximum penalty identical to the penalty for the subject matter of the conspiracy. However, that provision is not apposite to the present appeal. There is no analogue in the Firearms Act of s 26 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985). The substantive offence is created by s 51(1) of the Firearms Act and has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. No standard non-parole period attaches to the offence. 

Objective features

10The facts can be summarised very briefly. As for count one, on 5 June 2010 the co-offender Mr Le agreed to supply Mr Truong with the firearm in question, a Bruni semi-automatic pistol, for the sum of $5,000. Mr Truong agreed to supply it to the co-offender Mr Nguyen for the sum of $7,500. Mr Nguyen agreed to supply the pistol to an undercover operative for the sum of $9,500. The arrangements were put into effect on 7 June 2010, and Mr Truong netted $2,500. 

11As for count two, later in the same month Mr Le agreed to supply Mr Truong with a .25 calibre Melior semi-automatic pistol for an unspecified amount. Mr Truong agreed to supply Mr Nguyen with the pistol for $7,500. Mr Nguyen agreed to supply the undercover operative with the pistol for $8,000. The agreements were fulfilled on 22 June 2010. It is not clear on the evidence how much profit Mr Truong made.

12The facts of the four offences on the Form 1 were as follows. As for the first, on 16 May 2010, Mr Truong offered to supply the Beretta pistol to Mr Nguyen for $7,500. Very soon afterwards, Mr Nguyen offered to sell the same firearm to the undercover operative for $10,000. For some reason, the transaction did not proceed. 

13The second offence on the Form 1 was committed between 9 and 10 June 2010. It will be recalled that that was shortly after the occasion when count one was committed. Mr Le supplied Mr Truong with three .38 calibre rounds. Mr Truong supplied them to Mr Nguyen, who in turn supplied them to the undercover operative. 

14The third offence on the Form 1 featured a supply of ammunition on 22 June 2010, the same day upon which count two occurred. Again, Mr Le supplied Mr Truong with six .25 calibre rounds. Those were supplied to Mr Nguyen, who in turn supplied them to the undercover operative. 

15The final offence on the Form 1 was the conspiracy. In short, on 6 July 2010, Mr Le informed Mr Truong that he would be able to obtain at least five firearms in Queensland. Mr Truong contacted Mr Nguyen, and informed Mr Nguyen that he, Mr Truong, would shortly be obtaining five firearms for sale. Mr Nguyen informed the undercover operative. Mr Le did indeed travel to Queensland, and on return was arrested. He was found to have possession of three replica pistols, and it was his intention to modify those pistols in order to make them operable. 

Subjective features

16Mr Truong pleaded guilty at an early stage and received a 25 per cent discount as a result. That discount is not impugned by either party to this appeal. 

17On arrest, Mr Truong made full admissions. His Honour found that he was remorseful. 

18His Honour accepted that the background to the offending of Mr Truong was that Mr Le owed Mr Truong some thousands of dollars. Being involved in these illicit transactions was a way for Mr Truong to seek to regain the sum in which he was out of pocket. 

19Mr Truong had enjoyed a basically happy and stable upbringing, and was in a loving relationship at the time of the offences and as at the date of sentence. He had left school in Year 10, and had had unskilled jobs. At one stage he had been unemployed, but there was a deal of evidence to demonstrate that he was a highly regarded worker. Over the years he had suffered from a serious gambling problem. He had also used cocaine, but his Honour was not persuaded that it had played any great role in his commission of the offences. In custody, he had been a quiet prisoner who was open to doing courses in order to further his rehabilitation. 

20The criminal record of Mr Truong was not unblemished. However, it was quite short. In 2008 he was charged with dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime, and received a bond for six months. In 2009 he was charged with driving whilst his license was suspended. He received a bond for 12 months for the offence. He was subject to that bond when he committed the offences under consideration. 

Sentences imposed

21Annexed to this judgment is a diagram that seeks to explain the structure of the sentences imposed upon Mr Truong in a readily comprehensible form.

22With regard to count one, which related to the Bruni pistol, his Honour imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 4 years, to date from 22 July 2010 and expire on 21 July 2014, with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 3 years, to date from 22 July 2010 and expire on 21 July 2013. 

23With regard to count two, which related to the Melior pistol and took into account the Form 1, his Honour imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 8 years, to date from 22 July 2010 and expire on 22 July 2018, with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 5 years, to date from 22 July 1010 and expire on 21 July 2015. 

24It can be seen that the sentence for count one is wholly concurrent with the sentence for count two. Furthermore, it is apparent that special circumstances were found with regard to count two; if that had not been the case, the non-parole period for the offence would have been imprisonment for 6 years.

GROUNDS OF APPEAL OF TRUONG

25Six grounds of appeal were notified. I shall deal with each of them in turn. 

Ground One

""His Honour the learned sentencing Judge erred in his application of section 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 (5 October 2011), a decision passed after imposition of sentence in this matter by his Honour, held that section 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, was not framed in mandatory terms and that the standard non-parole period was not an appropriate starting point for the deliberation of sentence. His Honour at the time of sentence did not have the assistance of the reasoning of the High Court and was in error in his application of section 54B(2) of that Act.""

Background and Submissions

26This ground was founded upon the following portions of the remarks on sentence:

""Way's Case in the legislation says that the standard non-parole period applies to a mid-range case where an offender is convicted after trial and without any adjustment for any of the factors in s 21A including special circumstances and common law factors.

The offender has pleaded guilty and therefore there are reasons why the non-parole period should not be applied but as the courts have said, it is still relevant as a reference point or guidepost.

...

I consider, based on all those matters, that the offences fall below, but not substantially below, the mid-range of objective seriousness and the appropriate starting point is a non-parole period of eight years. I have noted that the offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and this, accordingly, warrants a twenty five per cent discount for its utilitarian value.

There are, as I have said, subjective factors which warrant a reduction of that non-parole period and also justify a finding of special circumstances.""

27Senior counsel for Mr Truong submitted that the process adopted by his Honour is inconsistent with the approach discussed in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. In short, it was submitted that the approach adopted by his Honour was too structured and prescriptive. 

28Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that his Honour correctly referred to the standard non-parole period as nothing more than a guidepost. She referred to Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 in support of the proposition that it will be rare for remarks on sentence that predate the judgment in Muldrock v The Queen and refer to the standard non-parole period as a guidepost to be found to be erroneous by this Court. She submitted that, in truth, what occurred was an instinctive synthesis in accordance with Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357. 

Determination

29I respectfully suggest that, for ease of comprehension, grounds of appeal to this Court are formulated more pithily than the ground under consideration.

30I consider that this ground can be dealt with quickly and without reviewing the history of this Court's reaction to the decision in Muldrock v The Queen over the past 16 months. Such a review is contained in R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [9] - [21] and ""After Muldrock - sentencing for standard non-parole period offences in NSW"" (2010) 24(10) Judicial Officers' Bulletin 81 by R A Hulme J. 

31It seems to me that the submissions of senior counsel for Mr Truong have a degree of force. Whilst it is true that his Honour referred to the standard non-parole period as a reference point or guidepost, the latter extract from the remarks on sentence is suggestive to me of an approach that is not consistent with the principles enunciated in Muldrock v The Queen and Markarian v The Queen. Although it is a matter of interpretation, I consider that it is open to infer that, with regard to count two, his Honour took as a starting point the standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years; made a finding that the objective seriousness of the offence fell below, but not substantially below, the mid-range of objective seriousness; as a result took as a starting point a non-parole period of imprisonment for 8 years (that point being below, but not substantially below, the standard non-parole period of 10 years); reduced that non-parole period by 25 per cent in order to reflect the utilitarian discount, arriving at a non-parole period of imprisonment for 6 years; and, finally, reduced that period of time by 1 year in order to reflect subjective features and special circumstances. 

32I consider that such an approach was overly prescriptive and inconsistent with the approach explained in Muldrock v The Queen, even bearing in mind the reference by his Honour to the standard non-parole period as a guidepost and the note of caution sounded in Butler v R at [26]. 

33I emphasise that my opinion that this ground should be upheld is not founded on the mere fact that the remarks on sentence were delivered before the judgment in Muldrock v The Queen. As Davies J (with whom Whealy JA and Rothman J agreed) said in Butler v R, simply because remarks on sentence predate Muldrock v The Queen does not found a ground of appeal. That is especially the case when there has been a plea of guilty, and as a result the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as a guidepost.

34To the contrary, I consider that the ground should be upheld because, in this particular case, it is tolerably clear that his Honour has engaged in a process of reasoning that is rigid to the point of being inconsistent with Muldrock v The Queen and Markarian v The Queen. 

35In short, I would uphold this ground of appeal. Whether it would result in the reduction of any aspect of the sentence structure of Mr Truong is an entirely separate question, and depends upon the application by this Court of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. I shall deal with that question at the end of my consideration of all the grounds of appeal of Mr Truong. 

36In short, I would uphold ground one. 

Ground Two

""His Honour the learned sentencing judge was misled by the presentation of inaccurate 'agreed facts'. This led his Honour to treat the offences of knowingly take part in the sale of a prohibited firearm as being more serious than was actually the case.""

Background and submissions

37This ground averted two errors of fact, one with regard to the Bruni pistol and one with regard to the Melior pistol. It is convenient to deal with them separately.

The first submission

38This was founded on confusion that developed in the proceedings on sentence. It requires a little explanation. In a nutshell, the question was whether the Bruni pistol, the subject of count one, could actually fire live rounds. There was no dispute that that firearm was originally designed to fire blanks or gas cartridges only. However, the ballistics expert who examined it provided a report that was ambiguous as to whether or not, when he examined the firearm, it had been modified so as to permit the discharge of live rounds. 

39In the proceedings on sentence of Mr Truong, his Honour was provided with an agreed statement of facts to the effect that the Bruni pistol was capable of firing live rounds. As one would expect, his Honour made a finding in the remarks on sentence to that effect.

40In subsequent proceedings on sentence pertaining to the co-offender Mr Nguyen, counsel for Mr Nguyen challenged the proposition that the Bruni pistol was capable of firing live rounds. The Crown conceded that it was not, and Mr Nguyen was accordingly sentenced upon that basis. So was, it seems, the offender Mr Le. 

41In light of those subsequent events, this part of the ground as originally formulated was to the effect that Mr Truong had been sentenced on a basis that was factually wrong. In response, senior counsel for the Crown sought to read an affidavit that was intended to establish the contrary proposition; in other words, that his Honour had not been misled, and the Bruni pistol was indeed capable of firing live rounds, and that the error was in truth in the proceedings on sentence of Mr Nguyen and Mr Le, who received an unearned benefit as a result. In the event, the affidavit was not read, but senior counsel for Mr Truong accepted that, in truth, his complaint was that Mr Truong had not received the benefit of the erroneous concession by the Crown that Mr Nguyen and Mr Le had received in their proceedings on sentence. 

42In short, the submission of senior counsel for Mr Truong was that, to borrow a well-known phrase used in discussing erroneous disparity of sentence, Mr Truong would experience a ""justifiable sense of grievance"" about the fact that his co-offenders were sentenced on a factually erroneous basis that may have led them to receiving shorter sentences than they would otherwise have received, but that the error did not occur in his case. 

Determination

43This part of ground two can be disposed of shortly. It seems that Mr Nguyen and Mr Le received a benefit erroneously, initially founded on an ambiguous report of an expert. Of course there is no Crown appeal on that basis with regard to their sentences. But it is nevertheless regrettable that it could be that facts that were objectively incorrect played a role in them receiving a sentence less than they would have received if the facts had been correct. 

44Nothing can, or should, be done about the sentences imposed on Mr Nguyen and Mr Le. However, I reject without difficulty the proposition that that error, far from being corrected, should be extended by way of some reduction in the sentence of Mr Truong, in order to reflect the putative reduction that may have occurred in the sentences of Mr Nguyen and Mr Le. I do not accept that, far from correcting the error, this Court should knowingly replicate it, in circumstances where there is no dispute that the Bruni pistol was indeed capable of firing live rounds. 

45It follows that I would not uphold this part of ground two.

The second submission

46Secondly, senior counsel for Mr Truong submitted that there had also been an erroneous finding of fact with regard to the Melior pistol. The background is that that firearm, when sold, was not in working order. The shear pin had been replaced with a bent piece of wire and the slide of that semi-automatic pistol was fractured. The ballistics expert made it clear in his report that that was the case. However, after the expert replaced the damaged mechanism, he found that the firearm could fire projectiles. 

47In the latter stage of the remarks on sentence, his Honour said:

""As I have noted, the handgun in count two, the Melior, was in fact inoperative. I infer that the defect was easily remediable given the sale was made in a criminal milieu and notions of Sellers Warranty and Fair Trading Act obligations are more likely to give way to swift revenge if a customer who is the prospective user of an illegal handgun feels aggrieved or cheated.""

48Senior counsel for Mr Truong submitted that that finding was erroneous. He sought to call in aid evidence given by the co-offender Mr Nguyen on a different day before a different Judge, but I consider that his Honour can hardly be criticised for not making findings of fact that take into account evidence that was not before his Honour. 

49In short, the complaints of senior counsel for Mr Truong as I understand them with regard to the Melior were first, that the agreed facts were incorrect to the extent that they may have suggested that, at the time of sale, the Melior was in working order; and, secondly, the finding of fact of his Honour that that inoperative firearm could be readily repaired was not reasonably open. 

50Senior counsel for the Crown emphasised the undeniable proposition that the Judge sentenced Mr Truong on the basis that the Melior was inoperative. She also emphasised that there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that Mr Truong had any belief that the Melior was not functional.

Determination

51This part of ground two can be dealt with briefly as well. His Honour was perfectly aware that the Melior was inoperative at the time of sale, and referred to that fact explicitly in the remarks on sentence. 

52As for the ease with which its defects could be repaired, his Honour drew an inference that one would not dare to sell a seriously defective firearm for a substantial sum of money to a person whom one believed to be part of the criminal milieu unless any defect was readily corrected. That inference was reasonably open. So was the finding of fact that was founded upon it. 

53It follows that I would not uphold the second part of ground two.

Ground Three

""His Honour the learned sentencing judge misinterpreted the facts relating to the second matter on the Form 1, and incorrectly associated the ammunition supplied with either of the pistols the subject of the two substantive counts. This artificially increased the criminality involved in that count.""

Background and submissions

54It will be recalled that the second matter on the Form 1 was selling ammunition between 9 and 10 June 2010. In the remarks on sentence, his Honour said that the facts of that charge were as follows:

""In relation to the sell ammunition without licence offence, the second matter on the Form 1, the brief facts are that on the evening of 9 June, Mr Le met the offender in Silverwater where Le supplied ammunition for the pistol to Mr Truong, the offender. He drove to Mr Nguyen's place where he supplied that ammunition to Mr Nguyen. On 10 June, Mr Nguyen drove his vehicle to the Meadowbank wharf car park, met the relevant police officer and supplied three Smith and Wesson .38 calibre rounds to him. That was, monitored both physically and electronically.""

55Senior counsel for Mr Truong emphasises the phrase ""for the pistol"" in that extracted portion.

56It will be recalled that the firearm that was sold on 7 June 2010 was the Bruni pistol, which is the subject matter of count one. It was not a weapon capable of firing .38 calibre ammunition. The Bruni pistol was only capable of firing .32 calibre ammunition. 

57In contrast to the extract, in the latter part of the remarks on sentence, when assessing the objective gravity of the offences, his Honour said ""[n]ext, the weapons were supplied but not with ammunition. That is a matter which bears upon the issue.""

58Senior counsel for Mr Truong submitted that his Honour must have taken into account the incorrect proposition that the .38 calibre rounds could be used in the Bruni pistol as a matter of aggravation. He submitted that that would have led the second offence on the Form 1 to have wrongly inflated the sentence imposed for count two. In short he submitted that that sentence should be somewhat reduced in order to reflect the factual error that his Honour had made. 

59Senior counsel for the Crown noted that the portion of the remarks on sentence now complained of is derived verbatim from the facts to which Mr Truong agreed at first instance and that, in the circumstances, this Court should be slow to permit him to complain successfully about it now. She also invited attention to the latter extract from the remarks on sentence to which I have referred, and which stands for the opposite proposition. Finally, she submitted that his Honour made no connection between the offences contained in the counts with the offence in the Form 1 under consideration.

Determination

60This ground can be disposed of shortly as well. Quite apart from the difficulties that confront an applicant who seeks to impugn findings of fact contained in remarks on sentence that are themselves directly based on facts to which he or she has agreed at first instance, I consider that it is neither here nor there whether the three .38 calibre rounds could be used in the Bruni pistol itself. The fact is that they could be used in countless handguns that are circulating illegally in the community. To my mind, it matters not whether that ammunition could be used in the particular handgun in the supply of which Mr Truong had played a role, or some other handgun. Furthermore, there was no evidence upon which it could be inferred that his Honour took into account the proposition that that ammunition could be used in that pistol as an aggravating feature. If anything, the latter portion of the remarks on sentence is to the contrary.

61In short, I would not uphold ground three.

Ground Four

""The effective sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.""

62Senior counsel for Mr Truong submitted that a combination of factors had resulted in a sentence that is manifestly excessive. First, there had been the overly prescriptive approach to the standard non-parole period, which, he submitted, would have led to a sentence more severe than would otherwise have been imposed. Secondly, he referred to the ""factual errors"" with regard to the serviceability of the two firearms, though by the end of the hearing I understood it to be accepted that the Bruni pistol was indeed serviceable and his Honour had understood that the Melior pistol was indeed inoperable at the time of sale. Thirdly, it was submitted that the mistake of fact about the three .38 calibre cartridges had played the same role. In short, it was submitted that all of those matters must have had an effect on his Honour, with the result that the sentence is manifestly excessive.

63To the contrary, senior counsel for the Crown emphasised a number of matters. First, his Honour had imposed wholly concurrent sentences on the two counts, which extended a substantial degree of leniency to Mr Truong. Secondly, the second count needed to reflect the significant criminality encompassed by the offences on the Form 1. Thirdly, although the criminal record of Mr Truong was not of the greatest seriousness, it was a matter of aggravation that he had been subject to the bond for the driving offence when he committed these offences. Fourthly, special circumstances were found that reduced the operative non-parole period by one year. Fifthly, the offences were undoubtedly part of organised criminal activity. Sixthly, the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and the standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years demonstrate that Parliament regards such offences as nothing other than grave. In short, she submitted that the sentences, whether viewed individually or as a whole, are not manifestly excessive.

Determination

64This ground can be dealt with quickly and without detailed reference to other decisions of this Court, although nothing in R v Dunn [2003] NSWCCA 169, R v Goktas [2004] NSWCCA 296 or R v Howard [2004] NSWCCA 348 (to all of which his Honour referred in the remarks on sentence) is helpful to the submission of senior counsel for Mr Truong in support of this ground.

65The fact is that Mr Truong was dealt with for two offences whereby handguns were illegally provided. It was only through good fortune that they were not disseminated into the community. Of course, Mr Truong had no idea that the ultimate purchaser was an undercover operative, and thought that the weapons and ammunition were being provided to a criminal. Not only that, Mr Truong engaged in a conspiracy to sell five further pistols. He also agreed to supply a Beretta pistol, although that transaction did not proceed. And he supplied, on at least two occasions, live ammunition. The motivation for the offences was a desire to profit, and the sums received by Mr Truong in return for his criminality were not insubstantial. 

66In short, Mr Truong engaged in the business of the professional supply of deadly weapons. Every single one of the firearms that Mr Truong supplied, or offered to supply, or conspired to supply, could have fallen into the hands of a hardened criminal, or a desperate drug addict, or a mentally disturbed person, but for the interposition of the police. In any of those cases, the outcome could have been fatal; indeed, catastrophic. Events in Australia and overseas demonstrate the ghastly consequences of illicit lethal weapons being at large in the community. Parliament has indicated by way of the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period that those who profit from trading in lethal weapons should receive condign punishment. Semi-automatic pistols are especially pernicious, not only because they are able to be readily concealed, but also because they are capable of firing projectiles in quick succession. 

67As for the structure of the sentences themselves, his Honour extended a noteworthy degree of leniency by making the two sentences wholly concurrent. Many judges at first instance would have made the sentence for count two partly cumulative upon the sentence for count one, at least to some degree. 

68The submission that the sentences, whether individually or in their total effect, are manifestly excessive cannot be sustained. It follows that I would not uphold ground four. 

Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act

69I have upheld ground one, and accordingly consideration needs to be given to re-sentence. Senior counsel for Mr Truong did not provide any fresh evidence upon which he relied as to the progress or otherwise of Mr Truong since the date of sentence. 

70Quite apart from being satisfied that the sentences are not manifestly excessive, I am also satisfied that no lesser sentence is warranted in law. There is no need for me to repeat what I have said about the seriousness of offences of trading in illicit semi-automatic weapons. Accordingly, although ground one has been upheld, I consider that that fact should have no effect in reducing either head sentence or either non-parole period. 

Orders

71I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.



R v Hoang Minh Le

Offences and Objective features 

72As indicated above, there is no application for leave to appeal against sentence by Mr Le. However, there is a Crown appeal against the sentences imposed upon Mr Le.

73It is convenient to deal with the offences and their objective features together. 

74Mr Le was sentenced for six offences by Judge Sides QC in the District Court on 13 February 2012. I shall discuss them in the order in which they were discussed in the remarks on sentence. There were also four offences on a Form 1. 

75The first was selling the Bruni pistol on 7 June 2010. This was the same pistol discussed by me with regard to Mr Truong. It will be recalled that Mr Le supplied the pistol for $5,000 to Mr Truong, who supplied it to Mr Nguyen, who supplied it to the undercover operative. It was not clear from the evidence how much Mr Le had paid to obtain the pistol. As noted above, his Honour approached the matter (wrongly, as it turns out) on the basis that the Bruni pistol could not discharge live rounds, but merely an explosive irritant. 

76This offence was brought pursuant to s 51(1A) of the Firearms Act. It carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years. 

77On 9 June 2010, Mr Le supplied Mr Truong with the three .38 calibre rounds referred to by me above. Mr Truong supplied them to Mr Nguyen, who then supplied them to the undercover operative. This offence carried a maximum penalty of a $5,500 fine. It was dealt with on a Form 1 that was taken into account with regard to the Melior pistol offence discussed immediately below. 

78On 22 June 2010, Mr Le supplied Mr Truong with the Melior .25 calibre pistol. Mr Truong supplied it to Mr Nguyen, who supplied it to the undercover operative. This offence was brought pursuant to s 51(1A) of the Firearms Act. It carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years. 

79As I have said, this was the offence to which the Form 1 was attached. It will be recalled that that Melior pistol was not in working order when supplied to the undercover operative, but the ballistics officer made it so. 

80On the same day, Mr Le gave Mr Truong six .25 calibre rounds. Mr Truong supplied them to Mr Nguyen, who supplied them to the undercover operative. This offence was also contained on the Form 1. It also carried a $5,500 fine. 

81On 6 July 2010, Mr Le offered to sell the five firearms that he was proposing to obtain in Queensland to Mr Truong. It will be recalled that, on the return of Mr Le from Queensland, the police found three replica pistols in the boot of his car. Those events gave rise to a charge of offering to sell a pistol, pursuant to s 51(1A) of the Firearms Act. The maximum penalty of that offence is 20 years and there is a standard non-parole period of 10 years. That offence was taken into account on the Form 1 as well.

82Mr Le was also sentenced for two offences of manufacturing a firearm. Pursuant to s 50A(2) of the Firearms Act, the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years. Those charges were based upon some telephone intercepts, and also upon what Mr Le told police during an ERISP on 22 July 2010. He informed them that he had undertaken some work on the Bruni pistol, including replacing the handle and polishing the firearm. Although in the interview he denied modifying the barrel, it is recorded in the remarks on sentence that the Crown accepted the plea on the basis that it was indeed Mr Le who had done so. In relation to the Melior pistol, Mr Le admitted to the police that he had received that firearm in parts, and had put it together using new screws. He had also fixed the trigger and slide and modified the handle. 

83On 22 July 2010, police executed a search warrant at the home of Mr Le and arrested him. During that search they found an unassembled pistol in a shed. It was found to be an imitation pistol. As a result, Mr Le was dealt with for possessing a firearm. Pursuant to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act, that offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 3 years. 

84Finally, during the execution of the search warrant, police located 42.34 grams of methylamphetamine. The street value of that drug was around $5,000. Indicia of supply were also located. The home of Mr Le was fortified and secured in such a way as to give rise to an inference that he was a drug dealer who feared for his safety and possessions. 

85Finally, during the search, the police located a taser. Mr Le claimed to have it for his own protection. Pursuant to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, the offence of possessing that item carries a maximum penalty of 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 3 years. That offence was placed on the Form 1. 

86In short, Mr Le was sentenced for six substantive offences, and four offences were taken into account on a Form 1. Five of the substantive offences were to do with firearms, and one was an offence of supplying drugs. The Form 1 offences were to do with ammunition, firearms, and a taser. 

Subjective features

87Mr Le was 27 years old when he stood for sentence. He had been born in a refugee camp and came to Australia at the age of five. His upbringing had been marred by the behaviour of his father, who was a violent alcoholic. Despite the mistreatment he suffered at his father's hands, his death traumatised Mr Le, and induced in him a major depressive disorder. He used amphetamines as a means of self-medication. 

88Mr Le left school in Year 10, and had a number of unskilled jobs. His employment history was described by his Honour as ""spasmodic"". His mother was shown to be ill. His Honour did not extend leniency on that specific basis, although it was taken into account as part of the subjective background, and it was accepted that custody would be more burdensome for Mr Le as a result. 

89The learned sentencing Judge placed emphasis on the fact that Mr Le had no prior convictions, and had never been in custody before. While on bail for these offences, he had not offended further. 

90His Honour accepted that these were offences that constituted planned and organised criminal activity. However, his Honour also found that the motivation of the offences was financial stress rather than greed.

91His Honour found that, to some degree at least, the two offences of manufacturing a firearm would not have been detected without the admissions made by Mr Le in his ERISP.

Sentences imposed

92I shall briefly detail the sentences that were imposed. Again, annexed to this judgment is a diagram that seeks to explain the structure of the sentences imposed in a readily comprehensible form.

93For the offence of possessing the imitation pistol, a head sentence of 1 year 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 months was imposed. Although the remarks on sentence refer to that sentence commencing on 16 February 2012, I infer that that is a typographical error, and that the sentence in truth commenced on 6 February 2012. So much is clear from the portion of the remarks on sentence immediately preceding the imposition of that sentence. 

94For the offence of manufacturing the Bruni pistol, a head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year was imposed. That sentence commenced on 6 February 2012. 

95For the offence of manufacturing the Melior pistol, a head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year was imposed. That sentence commenced on 6 May 2012. 

96For the offence of supplying methylamphetamine, a head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months was imposed. That sentence commenced on 6 November 2012. 

97For the offence of selling the Bruni pistol, a head sentence of 3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 9 months was imposed. That sentence commences on 6 November 2013. 

98For the offence of selling the Melior pistol (which included the four matters on the Form 1), a head sentence of imprisonment for 4 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years was imposed. That sentence commences on 6 May 2015. 

99A number of aspects of the sentencing structure may be noted. 

100First, the total head sentence is imprisonment for 7 years 9 months, and the total non-parole period is imprisonment for 5 years 3 months. 

101Secondly, the sentence for the offence of possessing a firearm is wholly concurrent with one of the sentences for manufacturing a firearm. In turn, the period in custody referable to those two offences is 3 months. The period in custody referable to the second manufacture firearm sentence is 6 months. The period in custody referable to the drug supply sentence is 12 months. The period in custody referable to the sentence for selling the Bruni pistol is 18 months. The period in custody referable to the selling of the Melior pistol is 2 years. 

102Thirdly, the ratio between the head sentence and non-parole period of each sentence is in most cases 50 per cent, and in the case of the two offences of selling a firearm it is 50 per cent and 44 per cent.

103Fourthly and finally, the ratio between the total non-parole period and total head sentence is a little under 68 per cent. 

GROUNDS OF APPEAL OF LE

104The Crown pressed a number of grounds of appeal. I shall deal with them in turn. The original ground of appeal was manifest inadequacy. That ground will be considered in conjunction with the final ground. 

105Ground one was abandoned.

Ground Two

""The Judge erred in his assessment of the seriousness of the offences of manufacturing and selling firearms [sequences 1, 3 and 12].""

106In the remarks on sentence, his Honour said:

""[E]ach offence is towards the lower end of their respective range, but not at the bottom of their respective range.""

It was submitted that that finding was an error on the part of his Honour. In particular it was submitted that, with regard to the manufacture of the Melior pistol, Mr Le had worked on it with an eye to making it operational (even though, at the time of sale, that was not in fact the case), and believed that he had achieved his goal. It was also noted that his Honour had accepted that the offences were premeditated and part of organised criminal activity. 

107It was also submitted by the Crown that that characterisation by his Honour could not apply to the offences that encompassed the criminality of selling two pistols.

108Senior counsel for Mr Le submitted that that characterisation was open to his Honour, and this Court would be very slow to interfere with it.

109Senior counsel for Mr Le referred to Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282, in which Spigelman CJ said at [37]:

""Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour. In my opinion it was open, although I have some hesitation in deciding so and find it to be at the lower end of the range which could reasonably be held to be so characterised.""

110Senior counsel for Mr Le submitted that, in short, there was no complaint about the characterisation as it applied to the work done on the Bruni pistol. As for the Melior pistol, it was objectively unable to operate when sold. As for the sale offences, on the facts as agreed between the parties, that pistol was capable of firing an irritant only, and not live rounds. Again, as for the Melior pistol, he emphasised that it was not functional when sold. 

Determination

111The offence of manufacturing a firearm in s 50A(2) is as follows: 

""A person who manufactures a prohibited firearm or pistol is guilty of an offence under this subsection unless the person is authorised by a licence or permit to manufacture the prohibited firearm or pistol.""

The definition of manufacture is contained in s 50A(5) and is as follows:

""In this section: 

manufacture a firearm includes assemble a firearm from firearm parts."" 


The criminality encompassed by the offence can extend from a very sophisticated operation at the one end of the spectrum to a relatively minor adjustment to a pre-existing firearm at the other. Here, it is true that Mr Le received the Melior pistol in parts and assembled it. He also sought to fix the slide by the relatively primitive measure of inserting wire from a coat hanger. He also added a piece of leather to the handle. But the simple fact is that that firearm when sold was not in working order. 

112As for the Bruni pistol, he had hardly built it from scratch. 

113As for the offences of selling the two pistols, on the facts placed before his Honour the Bruni pistol fired only irritants, and the Melior pistol when sold fired nothing. 

114Of course, minds may differ as to the objective characterisation of offences, both generally and in this particular case. But I am not persuaded that the characterisation provided by his Honour was not open to the evaluative judgment of his Honour. 

115It follows that I would not uphold ground two.

Ground Three

""The Judge erred in failing to have regard to the guidepost provided by the applicable standard non-parole periods for the offences of selling firearms [sequences 1 and 3].""

Background and submissions

116Although this ground is expressed as a failure to have regard to the standard non-parole period for the offences of selling firearms, the written submissions were:

""the sentences imposed do not reflect that the Judge had due regard to it as a governing guidepost"" [emphasis added]

117The submission as I understand it was, in short, that although his Honour had indeed explicitly referred to the applicable standard non-parole period of 10 years with regard to those two offences, and the fact that the sentences were being imposed after the decision in Muldrock v The Queen, in truth the sentences actually imposed erroneously failed to give appropriate weight to the standard non-parole period. 

118Senior counsel for Mr Le submitted that the ground is really a submission in support of manifest inadequacy, in that submissions about whether due regard has been given to a factor in sentencing concede that some regard has been given, and require an evaluation of the sentence actually imposed in order to determine whether that regard was sufficient. 

Determination

119I respectfully agree with the submission of senior counsel for Mr Le. Such an approach is consistent with what I have said in the past, most particularly in Hanania v R [2012] NSWCCA 220 with the agreement of Hoeben JA and Johnson J. 

120It follows that I shall consider the submissions of senior counsel for the Crown about the relationship between the standard non-parole period for the offence of selling a pistol and the non-parole periods actually imposed when I come to consider the latter grounds. 

121I would not uphold ground three as a separate ground. 

Ground Four

""The Judge erred in imposing individual sentences that were manifestly inadequate as to their term and non-parole period.""

Background and submissions

122The Crown submissions in support of this ground had a number of aspects. 

123First, it was noted that, in many cases, the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period was 50 per cent or less. 

124Secondly, it was submitted that the shortness of the non-parole periods limited the degree to which accumulation could sensibly occur. 

125Thirdly, senior counsel for the Crown focussed on the two offences of selling pistols. It will be recalled that the two offences of selling the pistols carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. And yet with regard to the selling of the Bruni pistol, a head sentence of 3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of only 1 year 9 months was imposed. With regard to the selling of the Melior pistol, a head sentence of 4 years 6 months with a non-parole period of only 2 years was imposed. 

126Fourthly, with regard to the manufacturing of the Melior pistol, it will be recalled that there was a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. And yet a head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year was imposed. That was, it was submitted, indicative of error. 

127Senior counsel for Mr Le submitted that there was nothing erroneous about the head sentences or the non-parole periods. He submitted that the ratio between the individual non-parole periods and the head sentences of around 50 per cent was not only open to the discretion of his Honour, but also had to be considered in the context of the ratio between the total non-parole period and the total head sentence, which is 68 per cent. That is hardly a substantial reduction from the statutory ratio of 75 per cent. 

128Focusing on the three sentences that were the subject of particular attack by the Crown, he submitted that the manufacturing of the Melior pistol was in truth primitive, and resulted in a firearm that in any event could not fire live rounds. As for the selling of the two pistols, he submitted that the offences, although motivated by financial gain, were relatively unprofessional. They were committed by a young man of prior good character who had suffered an unsatisfactory background and sunk into depression upon the death of his father. In all of the circumstances, the sentences could not be said to be manifestly inadequate. 

Determination

129There is a degree of artificiality, with respect, in seeking to analyse the length of individual head sentences and non-parole periods within an overarching sentencing structure in order to demonstrate that one or more of them were manifestly inadequate. After all, if a sentence were longer, but maintained its position in the structure, it could well be that that would have no operative effect on the time that an offender is to spend in custody. By way of example, if the sentence for manufacturing the Melior pistol had been a head sentence of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 2 years (as opposed to a head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year), it can be seen that, unless its position in the structure were also altered, that would have no effect whatsoever on the period in custody actually to be served by Mr Le. This Court should not concern itself with altering sentences to no practical effect, except in unusual circumstances. 

130Furthermore, there is a degree of artificiality in discussing the ratio between individual non-parole periods and individual head sentences within an overarching structure. Again, the operative ratio that determines how long Mr Le must spend in custody and how long he may spend on parole is that between the total non-parole period and the total head sentence. As I have indicated, the reduction in the total non-parole period on the basis of special circumstances was in truth quite small.

131In discussing the submission on behalf of Mr Truong that the sentences imposed upon him were manifestly excessive, I have emphasised the seriousness of these kinds of offences. This Court has done so on many occasions in the past: see Cunningham v R [2005] NSWCCA 416 at [22] - [23] and R v Howard at [65].

132On the other hand, it was appropriate for the lack of prior or subsequent criminality on the part of Mr Le to be reflected in the sentences to be imposed to a substantial degree. 

133Finally, it needs to be borne in mind that one of the major aims of the adoption of a sentencing structure that features both partial accumulation and partial concurrence with regard to a large number of offences, such as the one under consideration, is to avoid the imposition of a crushing sentence upon an offender. 

134Undertaking the analysis of individual sentences upon which this ground is founded, I consider it is true that the head sentences could be characterised as lenient. And it is also true that the ratios between the individual non-parole periods and the individual head sentences could be described as generous. But it is well known that neither of those characteristics of a sentence are sufficient to found a ground of manifest inadequacy. I am not satisfied that the latter characterisation can be applied to the individual sentences. 

135It follows that I would not uphold ground four.

Ground Five

""The Judge erred in failing to impose an appropriate overall sentence to reflect totality.""

Background and submissions

136This ground focussed in particular on the first four sentences in the structure.

137It can be seen that the offence of possessing a firearm is wholly concurrent with the offence of manufacturing the Bruni pistol. In turn, only three months in custody is wholly referable to the latter offence. Only six months in custody is referable to manufacturing the Melior pistol. And only 12 months in custody is referable to supplying methylamphetamine.

138It was submitted by senior counsel for the Crown that the drug offence was completely separate from the firearm offences. It was also submitted that the manufacture of the Bruni pistol and the Melior pistol was separate and discrete from the sale of those firearms. The same submission was made with regard to the possession of the firearm at the home of Mr Le. 

139It was submitted that the lack of sufficient accumulation could not be divorced from the submission that the sentences themselves were too short. If the sentences had been longer, it was submitted, there could have been a greater degree of accumulation without the structure becoming distorted.

140Senior counsel for the Mr Le submitted that this was not a complaint about an absence of partial accumulation on the part of the Crown. Rather, what was being complained about was the degree of accumulation. He submitted that such a ground will not easily attract favour, due to the long-standing and wide discretion accorded to sentencing judges in determining questions of whether to partially accumulate and, if so, to what degree. He re-emphasised the subjective features in submitting that it could not be said that his Honour fell into error with regard to the structure of the first four offences.

Determination

141It is true that the sentence for the possession of a firearm in the shed of the home of Mr Le is wholly concurrent with another sentence. But I consider that that was well open to the discretion of his Honour. The firearm was an imitation pistol that was in pieces. It was open to his Honour to take the approach that that offence was connected with the overarching criminality encompassed in the other firearm offences.

142It is also true that the offence of manufacturing the Bruni pistol led to a solely referable period in custody of only three months, and the offence of manufacturing the Melior pistol led to a wholly referable period in custody of only six months. I accept that that was lenient, in light of the maximum penalty of imprisonment of 20 years. 

143On the other hand, as I have indicated, the manufacturing of the Bruni pistol led to, on the facts as presented to his Honour, a firearm that fired only irritants. Manufacturing of the Melior pistol led to a firearm that could not fire anything. In each case, the manufacturing was unsophisticated, and, with regard to the attempted repair of the fractured slide of the Melior, could be said to be primitive.

144Finally, I do not accept the submission that the manufacturing of the Bruni pistol and Melior pistol can be regarded as separate and discrete from the selling of those two firearms.

145In short, I do not consider that the structure of the two manufacturing offences demonstrates error. 

146Finally, I accept that the drug offence was separate from the firearm offences. I also accept that the fact that only 12 months is solely referable to the sentence in custody is a lenient result. I am not satisfied that such an operative position in the structure was not open to the discretion of his Honour and demonstrates error.

147It follows that I would not uphold ground five.

Ground Six

""The sentence is manifestly inadequate.""

Background and submissions

148This was the ground originally notified by the Crown. It calls for consideration of the total head sentence and the total non-parole period, though of course consideration needs to be given to the sentences that go to make up those total periods. 

149Particular focus was placed upon the sentences for the selling of the two pistols. It was submitted that, in the context of a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years, the non-parole period of 1 year 9 months and the non-parole period of 2 years were manifestly inadequate. Emphasis was placed upon the proposition that these were supplies of firearms for substantial sums of money, and accompanied by the provision of ammunition.

150It was also submitted that the drug offence was hardly a trivial one. It was accompanied by indicia of supply and security measures that suggested that Mr Le was hardly a user who merely on occasions supplied to friends and acquaintances. 

151In short, even accepting that the subjective circumstances had a degree of force, it was submitted that the total sentence of imprisonment for 7 years 9 months with a total non-parole period of 5 years 3 months failed to reflect the criminality of Mr Le.

152Because of the way in which the Crown's written submissions were structured, senior counsel for Mr Le did not provide separate written submissions about this ground. Nor was he called upon by this Court to address this ground orally.

Determination

153Considering the offences of selling the two pistols, it is true that the non-parole periods are notably short, when one compares them to the standard non-parole periods. But it needs to be recalled that they took their place in an overarching sentencing structure that imposed a not insignificant total head sentence and total non-parole period on a young man who had admitted his crimes, pleaded guilty at an early stage, suffered an unsatisfactory upbringing, and who had not offended before or since these offences.

154As for the overarching sentence structure that results in the total head sentence and the total non-parole period, reflection on the diagram leads to the conclusion that it was constructed by a most experienced sentencing Judge who took care to create a complex structure pertaining to six separate offences. 

155I accept that the sentences imposed for the offences of selling the pistols, and in particular the non-parole periods, are lenient. I also consider that the sentencing structure as a whole amply reflects the subjective features of this matter. But it is well established that such attributes of a sentence do not establish manifest inadequacy. Considering the total head sentence and the total non-parole period, I am not satisfied that the Crown has made good that characterisation. 

156It follows that I would not uphold ground six. 

Orders

157The order I propose in this matter is:

(1)Crown appeal dismissed.




Huy Nguyen v R; R v Huy Nguyen

Offences and objective features

158By way of overview, Mr Nguyen was dealt with for a large number of serious drug and firearm offences. Seven were committed for sentence to the District Court. Six were contained upon a Form 1. Nine driving offences were contained on a certificate pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

159On 18 October 2011, in the District Court of New South Wales, Judge Johnstone imposed an aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years with an aggregate non-parole period of imprisonment for 6 years. Clearly enough, special circumstances were found that led to a variation of the statutory ratio to 67 per cent. His Honour also provided a number of indicative sentences, which I shall detail shortly.

160I shall discuss each of the offences in the order in which his Honour dealt with them. I commence with the offences that were before his Honour for sentence. It is convenient to include a brief summary of the objective features of the offence as I do so. 

161Again, annexed to this judgment is a diagram that seeks to explain the structure of the sentences in a readily comprehensible form.

162The first offence was that Mr Nguyen supplied methylamphetamine on three or more occasions between 26 March 2010 and 20 April 2010. Pursuant to s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, that offence carried with it a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years. It has no standard non-parole period. On five separate occasions, Mr Nguyen supplied an undercover operative with the drug. The total amount supplied was 14.14 grams. The amount of money received was $7,700. The purity of the drug was between 64 and 78 per cent.

163The second charge was in identical terms, and related to the period between 28 April and 26 May 2010. Five separate supplies of the same drug were provided to the same undercover operative. The total amount of methylamphetamine was 13.42 grams, and the amount of money obtained was $7,200. The purity of the drug was between 64 and 78 per cent.

164The third offence was supplying the Bruni pistol on 7 June 2010. As noted before, pursuant to s 51(1A) of the Firearms Act, that offence attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years, and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. It will be recalled that this pistol had been supplied by Mr Le to Mr Truong, who in turn supplied it to Mr Nguyen, who supplied it to the undercover operative. The sum of $9,500 was received. Mr Nguyen profited in the amount of $2,000 from this transaction. 

165The fourth offence was in identical terms. It occurred on 22 June 2010, and the subject matter was the Melior pistol. The purchase price was $8,000. Mr Nguyen had himself purchased the firearm for $7,500, leading to a profit of $500. 

166The fifth offence was knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime. It was brought pursuant to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. That offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years with no standard non-parole period. It arose by way of the police executing a search warrant at the home of Mr Nguyen on 22 July 2010. There they found a large bundle of banknotes, amounting to $50,700 cash. 

167The sixth offence was supplying methylamphetamine. Pursuant to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the offence attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years and no standard non-parole period. This offence was founded on the finding of 19.1 grams of methylamphetamine at the home of Mr Nguyen when the search warrant was executed on 22 July 2010. The drug had a purity of 75.5 per cent. 

168Finally, the seventh offence was one of possessing an unauthorised prohibited pistol. Pursuant to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act, that offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years, and a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 3 years. Again, to state matters succinctly, when the police executed the search warrant at the home of Mr Nguyen on 22 July 2010, they located a .32 calibre Colt pistol fitted with a magazine contained five rounds of ammunition. In other words, the pistol was loaded, although it is not clear whether there was a live round in the chamber. 

169The s 166 Certificate contained nine driving offences. Each offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 18 months. These offences arose from Mr Nguyen driving a motor vehicle, whilst disqualified, to meetings with an undercover police officer for the purposes of supplying prohibited drugs. There is no need for me to discuss them in detail in this judgment. 

170There was a Form 1 that was attached to the fourth offence, that is, the selling of the Melior pistol. Six offences were contained on the Form 1. The first was offering to sell a Beretta 9mm pistol. That offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years. The facts of the offer to sell the Beretta pistol were that on 16 May 2010 the offender offered to sell to an undercover police officer the firearm at a price of $10,000. However, the sale never eventuated. 

171The second offence on the Form 1 was selling ammunition without seeing the license or permit of the buyer. That offence carried a fine only. The selling of the ammunition was the provision of the three Smith and Wesson .38 calibre rounds on 10 June 2010 to the undercover operative. 

172The third offence on the Form 1 was an identical charge of selling ammunition. It was alleged that between 22 June 2010 and 22 July 2010, Mr Nguyen supplied six .25 calibre rounds to the undercover operative. 

173The fourth offence on the Form 1 was conspiring to sell five pistols. That offence was said to have taken place between 6 July 2010 and 22 July 2010. The subject matter of this offence was the five pistols that, it will be recalled, Mr Le proposed to obtain in Queensland. The maximum penalty of the common law offence of conspiracy is at large. 

174The fifth offence on the Form 1 was possessing ammunition without holding a license or permit to do so. The maximum penalty for this offence was a fine. Again, this charge arose from the execution of the search warrant on 22 July 2010, and related to the finding of a box containing 35 Winchester .32 calibre rounds. 

175Finally, the sixth offence on the Form 1 was selling a prohibited .22 calibre pistol without a license between 14 October 2009 and 16 October 2009. Pursuant to s 51(2A) of the Firearms Act, that offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years. To state the facts succinctly, Mr Nguyen sold a .22 calibre pistol fitted with a silencer to a man called Wijeyakumar for $3,500. 

Subjective features

176Mr Nguyen pleaded guilty to all offences. He received a discount of 25 per cent in return for doing so. That discount is impugned by neither party to this appeal. His Honour accepted that Mr Nguyen was remorseful. 

177Mr Nguyen was 28 years of age when he stood for sentence. Although as a child he suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, his background had generally been a happy one. Perhaps as a result of his condition, he left school in Year 10 and enrolled in TAFE, but did not complete any course there. He had ""more or less"" regular employment. 

178In his early twenties he was introduced to drugs by friends and quickly became addicted to crystal methylamphetamine and heroin. In 2009 he was admitted to a drug rehabilitation centre. After that he entered a methadone programme. At the time of the offences he was taking methadone, but also continuing to abuse heroin.

179The criminal record of Mr Nguyen was lengthy. It featured convictions for possessing a prohibited drug, a number of property offences, and a large number of driving offences. It is true that, at the time of the commission of the offences under discussion, he was subject to a bond imposed in the Local Court for three charges of possessing a prohibited drug. On the other hand, it seems that Mr Nguyen had only received one custodial disposition in his life, namely a control order of 8 months with a non-parole period of a little over 1 month. Although he had been subject to a sentence of imprisonment by way of periodic detention for 3 months as a result of a shoplifting offence, it is noteworthy that he had never been sentenced to full-time imprisonment in an adult gaol before. 

180By the date of sentence, Mr Nguyen claimed to be drug free and to have been able to use his time in custody whilst bail refused to think more clearly about the course his life had taken. He gave evidence on the proceedings on sentence that all of the offences were motivated by a desperate desire to obtain money for drugs. 

Sentences imposed

181As noted above, his Honour adopted the procedure of imposing an aggregate sentence, pursuant to s 53A of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In doing so, his Honour provided indicative head sentences for each individual offence.

182With regard to the first offence of ongoing supply, there was an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for 5 years. With regard to the second offence of ongoing supply, there was an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for 5 years. With regard to the third offence of selling the Bruni pistol, there was an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for 3 years. With regard to the fourth offence of selling the Melior pistol, there was an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for 5 years. With regard to the fifth offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime, there was an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years. With regard to the sixth offence of supplying methylamphetamine, based on the prohibited drug found at the home of Mr Nguyen, an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years was provided. Finally, with regard to the seventh offence of possessing the Colt pistol at his home, an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for 5 years was provided.

183His Honour did not provide indicative non-parole periods with regard to the offences that carried standard non-parole periods. That founds a ground of appeal in the Crown appeal.

NGUYEN APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE

184Two grounds were pressed at the hearing of the appeal.

Ground Two

""His Honour erred in his assessment of the serviceability of the pistols which were the subject of the third and fourth sequences"".

185This ground focused upon findings of fact made by his Honour in the remarks on sentence about the operability of the Bruni and the Melior pistols. 

Background and submissions regarding Bruni pistol

186With regard to the Bruni pistol, the agreed statement of facts was to the effect that that weapon could never fire a live round. The solicitor then appearing for the Crown expressly conceded that, and informed his Honour that the information to the contrary previously provided to Judge Lakatos SC was incorrect. 

187However, in the remarks on sentence, his Honour said:

""Nevertheless, in this particular case, the sale in the Form 1 offence involved a serviceable weapon, and the degree to which the two other firearms sold were unserviceable was not major, and they were both readily capable of being made operable. One of them was fitted with a silencer.""

188It was submitted that, with regard to the Bruni pistol, that finding was not reasonably open on the evidence. As I have indicated, on the evidence before his Honour, the Bruni pistol was not capable of being made operable in the sense of firing live rounds.

189With regard to the Bruni pistol, senior counsel for the Crown submitted that, even if there was an error in that finding of fact on the evidence, the Bruni pistol was capable of firing both gas and liquid product, and perhaps that could be more dangerous in some circumstances.

Determination regarding Bruni pistol

190In a sense this ground is highly artificial, for a number of reasons. The first is that, as I have indicated, in the appeal of Mr Truong, it was accepted by both parties that in fact the agreed facts in the proceedings on sentence of Mr Nguyen were incorrect, and the Bruni pistol was indeed capable of firing live rounds. However, no concession to that effect was made by counsel for Mr Nguyen, and the ground was maintained. Furthermore, the Crown accepted that Mr Nguyen was entitled to have his sentence determined on the basis of the evidence placed before his Honour, even if that evidence was in truth erroneous. 

191The second artificial aspect of the submission is that no sentence was actually imposed for the selling of the Bruni pistol. An indicative head sentence of 3 years was provided, but in truth only one sentence was actually imposed: the aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years and the aggregate non-parole period of imprisonment for 6 years. In other words, even if the indicative head sentence of imprisonment for 3 years were reduced to reflect this finding of fact, the ground would only be efficacious if the aggregate head sentence were also reduced. 

192The third artificial aspect is that, on any analysis, the indicative head sentence of imprisonment for 3 years with regard to an offence that carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and, more importantly, a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years, must be characterised as markedly lenient.

193In short, his Honour referred to the fact that Bruni pistol was not capable of discharging live rounds as at the date of its sale. It seems that, by way of a slip, his Honour referred to it as being ""readily capable of being made operable"". A markedly lenient indicative head sentence was provided for that offence. Should this Court, even if it accepts that an error of fact has been made (on the evidence before his Honour), uphold the appeal in the sense of reducing, even to a small degree, the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period? 

194The answer to that question can be found in my discussion of the next ground of appeal of Mr Nguyen: namely, that the aggregate head sentence and aggregate non-parole period are manifestly excessive. It is also to be found in my discussion of the last ground of appeal in the Crown appeal regarding Mr Nguyen, namely that the aggregate head sentence and aggregate non-parole period are manifestly inadequate. It is also to be found in my discussion of the submission by Mr Truong that the total sentence imposed upon him was manifestly excessive.

195It suffices to say at this stage, that I consider that an error of fact has been established. And I am prepared to accept that the potential serviceability of the Bruni pistol could have been a material fact that was given some weight by his Honour in setting the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period. In other words, I am prepared to proceed on the basis that the error has some materiality. I therefore uphold this part of ground two. But it is convenient to move immediately to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 

Section 6(3) with regard to the Bruni pistol error

196The question is whether, error having been established with regard to the finding of fact that, on the evidence, the Bruni pistol was readily capable of being made operable, a lesser sentence is warranted in law. 

197This question can be disposed of quickly. It suffices to say that Mr Nguyen was heavily involved in the trafficking of firearms for money, and at the same time the supply of prohibited drugs for significant sums. In truth, there is only one question about quantum that arises with regard to the aggregate head sentence of 9 years and the aggregate non-parole period of 6 years: whether they are manifestly inadequate or very close to it. 

198I am affirmatively satisfied that, even if one accepts the possibility that the error with regard to the operability of the Bruni pistol is a material one, and had an effect on the sentence ultimately imposed, no lesser sentence is warranted in law than that actually imposed by his Honour. 

Background and submissions regarding Melior pistol

199The second question of fact that is said not have been reasonably open is the finding of his Honour that the Melior pistol was readily capable of being made operable. 

200In the statement of facts at [93], it was said of the Melior pistol:

""At the time of examination the firearm was not in working order due to the sear pin being replaced with a bent piece of wire and the slide being fractured. ... A substitute sear pin and slide was used in the firearm and the firearm was successfully test fired.""

201Counsel for Mr Nguyen invited attention to the following passage of cross-examination of Mr Nguyen in the proceedings on sentence at T13.14: 

""Q. No, but you couldn't say with any certainty that it would be easily able to be made working, would you agree with that?

A. Well if they can get the part for it and this and that, source the part, be worth more than the gun itself.""

202In short, counsel for Mr Nguyen submitted that the finding that the Melior pistol was readily capable of being made operable was not reasonably open. He submitted that one could infer that replacing the sear pin and fractured slide was not a simple or quick process.

203The Crown submitted that the finding was reasonably open. 

Determination

204To the passage in cross-examination relied upon by counsel for Mr Nguyen may be added the following:

""Q. But you don't have any knowledge to know whether it could easily be fixed or not do you?

A. No because I'm not a technician, I'm not a gun technician.""

205The ballistics report simply stated that replacing the fractured slide and the sear pin permitted the gun to operate. There was no evidence before his Honour whether that was a lengthy and complicated operation or a simple one. The evidence of Mr Nguyen that such a task would cost more than the gun itself does not fit comfortably with his general assertion that he knew little or nothing of firearms, and in my opinion can be put to one side. I also consider that his Honour was entitled to infer that Mr Nguyen would be unlikely to dare to sell to a man whom he believed to be a criminal buyer in firearms an item that could not be repaired at all, or only after a great deal of time and trouble. 

206On the evidence before his Honour, I consider that it was reasonably open to find that the Melior could be readily made operable. 

207Accordingly, this part of ground two fails.

208In summary with regard to ground two, I consider that a finding of fact about the Bruni pistol that was not reasonably open has been established. In that sense I would uphold ground two. However, the establishment of that error cannot lead to reduction in the aggregate sentence imposed. 

Ground Three

""The sentence is manifestly excessive.""

209This ground can be determined without a detailed conspectus of the background (beyond that which I have already provided) and the submissions of the parties.

210Mr Nguyen faced seven serious charges. A Form 1 contained two further serious charges and five less serious ones. He was obviously heavily involved in the selling of prohibited firearms, and also took part in the selling of prohibited drugs. Despite the assertions that he was a drug addict desperate for money in order to feed his addiction, it is noteworthy that he had over $50,000 cash in his home. His criminal record was by no means unblemished. And yet he received an aggregate head sentence of 9 years and an aggregate non-parole period of 6 years. 

211In the circumstances, the only real question is whether such a sentence is manifestly inadequate. I respectfully reject as unsustainable the proposition that such a sentence is manifestly excessive. Ground three is not made out. 

212It follows that the appeal against sentence of Mr Nguyen should be dismissed. 

CROWN APPEAL REGARDING NGUYEN

213Five grounds of appeal were notified and relied upon at the hearing. I shall deal with each of them in turn. 

Ground One

""The Judge erred in not indicating what non-parole periods he would have applied for offences 3, 4 and 7.""

214This ground can be disposed of quickly. It is quite true that his Honour failed to provide indicative non-parole periods with regard to the offences that attracted a standard non-parole period. That was contrary to s 54B(4A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which is as follows:

""When determining an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for one or more offences, the court is to indicate, for those offences to which a standard non-parole period applies, the standard non-parole period (or a longer or shorter non-parole period) that it would have set in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) for each such offence to which the aggregate sentence relates had it set a separate sentence of imprisonment for that offence.""

215However, s 54B(5) is apposite:

""The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate the sentence.""

216Furthermore, the transcript of the proceedings on sentence on 18 October 2011 reveals that the solicitor then appearing for the Crown did not assist his Honour with regard to the very issue about which complaint is now made in this Court. 

217Thirdly, setting non-parole periods for the indicative sentences would have no effect on the sentence imposed upon and to be served by Mr Nguyen. 

218Finally, it is to be recalled that it is the aggregate head sentence and aggregate non-parole period that can be the subject of appeal, not the indicative sentences: see R v Rae [2013] NSWCCA 9 at [32] - [34], PD v R [2012] NSWCCA 242 at [44] and R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 at [17]. 

219For all of those reasons, I would not uphold ground one. 

Ground Two

""The Judge erred in failing to have regard to the guidepost provided by the applicable standard non-parole periods for offences 3 and 4.""

220This ground may be disposed of quickly as well. In the written submissions of the Crown, the assertion in the ground that his Honour failed to have regard to the standard non-parole periods for offences three and four elided into the proposition that his Honour failed to have ""due regard"" to the standard non-parole periods. 

221It was accepted that, in the remarks on sentence, his Honour referred to having regard to the standard non-parole periods for the third, fourth and seventh offences, and also explicitly referred to the then recent decision in Muldrock v The Queen. Indeed, just before sentence was pronounced, his Honour invited the parties to make any submissions they wished with regard to that very case. 

222In truth, as I understand this ground, it asserts that the indicative head sentences are not properly reflective of the standard non-parole periods for the offences in question. That asserted error has itself, it is submitted, infected the aggregate head sentence and aggregate non-parole period that can be the subject of appeal. It follows that I shall deal with this question as a particular of ground five. 

223I would not uphold ground two as a separate ground. 

Ground Three

""The indicative sentences failed to reflect the findings of objective seriousness.""

Background and submissions

224In the remarks on sentence, his Honour described the drug and firearm offences as ""objectively serious"". A little later, with regard to the drug offences, his Honour said:

""I am satisfied that the drug offences involved trafficking to a substantial degree. This was not a street level operation. This offender was engaged in a sophisticated operation involving the regular supply of significant amounts of illegal drugs.""

225It was submitted that a review of the indicative head sentences demonstrates that they simply fail to reflect those characterisations of the objective seriousness of the offences. For example, it was submitted that it could not be the case that the selling of the Bruni pistol, which constituted the third offence, could properly have an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for 3 years, in the context of a 20 year maximum penalty and a 10 year standard non-parole period. Furthermore, the selling of the Melior pistol, which was reflected in the fourth offence, and which took into account the offences on the Form 1, two of which were serious, could not properly be visited with an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for 5 years. Again, with regard to the drug offences, it was noted that the two ongoing supplies had a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years, and yet resulted in two indicative head sentences of imprisonment for 5 years.

226Finally, the supply of methylamphetamine encompassed in the sixth offence, again a serious example of an offence that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years, could hardly be adequately reflected in an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years. 

227These submissions have a substantial degree of force. However, it must be remembered that the indicative head sentences cannot be the subject of an appeal to this Court. It is only the aggregate head sentence and aggregate non-parole period that can be the subject of an appeal. It follows that it is not a matter of this Court analysing each indicative sentence and determining whether it is erroneous. Rather, it is a matter of looking at the whole of the sentencing structure in order to determine whether the aggregate sentence can stand or not.

228For that reason, I shall regard these submissions as a particular of ground five, and an explanation by the Crown of how it is the error asserted in ground five is said to have arisen. They will be taken into account when I come to consider ground five. 

229I would not uphold this ground as a separate ground.

Ground Four

""The Judge erred in his approach to accumulation.""

230The submissions in support of this ground are a detailed examination of the remarks his Honour made as to which offences would be approached with an eye to at least some accumulation, and which offences would be the subject of concurrence, whether complete or very substantial.

231But it is clear that the process of aggregate sentencing, unlike traditional sentencing, does not permit of a mathematical analysis of the degrees to which partial and complete concurrence or accumulation have been adopted by a sentencing judge. All one can really do is look at each of the individual offences for which the offender was to be dealt, consider the indicative sentences (though I appreciate that it is the submission of the Crown that many of these were erroneous as well), and then determine whether the aggregate head sentence and aggregate non-parole period are erroneous in light of that background. The whole point of aggregate sentencing is to free sentencing judges from the task of creating elaborate sentence structures. A logical consequence of that is that this Court is not in a position to undertake an analysis of explicit questions of concurrence and accumulation in the same way that it can analyse traditional sentencing structures.

232For those reasons, I shall approach ground four, again, as a particular of ground five. All of the submissions made by the Crown with regard to this ground will be taken into account when I turn to ground five.

233It follows that I would not uphold ground four as a separate ground.

Ground Five

""The sentence is manifestly inadequate.""

234To recap, Mr Nguyen faced seven offences to which he had pleaded guilty in the Local Court. All of them were serious. Two of them had a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years. Contained on a Form 1 were two further serious offences, and a number of other offences. 

235With regard to the firearm offences, looked as a whole, the matter can be summarised as follows: on separate occasions, Mr Nguyen sold three pistols (the Bruni pistol, the Melior pistol, and a pistol with a silencer); he offered to sell a Beretta pistol; he conspired to sell five pistols; he possessed at his home a loaded Colt pistol; and he also sold and possessed ammunition. 

236Quite apart from that, he supplied methylamphetamine of high purity on a number of occasions and netted as a result $14,900. He also possessed for supply at his home a not insignificant amount of methylamphetamine. 

237To complete the picture, he had over $50,000 cash in his home.

238Is it conceivable that an aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years and an aggregate non-parole period of imprisonment for 6 years adequately reflects the criminality of Mr Nguyen? 

239On the other hand, he pleaded guilty in the Local Court and received a 25 per cent discount. Two of the serious matters were contained on a Form 1. He was found to be remorseful. He was sentenced on the basis that one of the guns could not fire live rounds at all, and the other was in no state to do so when sold. His Honour approached the matter on the basis that Mr Nguyen was not a professional seller of prohibited drugs and prohibited firearms, but rather a desperate drug addict. His criminal record, although not unblemished, on analysis is not that serious, and could be interpreted as the typical record of a drug addict rather than a professional criminal. His prospects of rehabilitation were found to be good. 

240The starting point adopted by his Honour must mathematically have been an aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for 12 years with an aggregate non-parole period of imprisonment for 8 years. That, on any reckoning, is not an insubstantial sentence to begin with regarding a person whose previous criminality did not remotely approach that encompassed in the offences under consideration. 

241It can be said without the need for deep analysis that many of the indicative head sentences are lenient. It can also be said that, considering all of the criminality of Mr Nguyen, the aggregate head sentence and aggregate non-parole period are notably lenient. It can finally be said that, speaking for myself, I would have imposed a longer aggregate head sentence and a longer aggregate non-parole period on Mr Nguyen. However, it is well known that the establishment of all of those propositions does not of itself lead to a successful Crown appeal on the ground of manifest inadequacy.

242I have given earnest consideration to this question. Ultimately, I have come to the view that the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period are on the cusp of being manifestly inadequate. In the end, I have decided that the aggregate sentence was open to the discretion of his Honour. I consider that that is the case if his Honour was giving full weight to the subjective features, and approaching the matter mercifully, as of course his Honour was entitled to do. 

243It follows that, on the basis that the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period just managed to come within the discretion available to his Honour, I would not uphold ground five.

Orders

244I propose the following orders in the matter of Mr Nguyen:

(1)Leave to appeal granted to the applicant Mr Nguyen.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

(3)Crown appeal against sentence dismissed.

		25 February 2013",2013-02-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761020,State of New South Wales v TD [2013] NSWCA 32,"HEADNOTE[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]
In 2001 the respondent was charged with robbery and assault with intent to rob. Her fitness to be tried was in doubt and a special hearing under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (NSW) was held.  On 2 May 2002 Woods DCJ found, on the limited evidence available, that she had committed the offence of assault with intent to rob.  His Honour set a ""limiting term"" of 20 months pursuant to ss 22(1)(c) and 23(1) of that Act, and ordered that she be detained at Mulawa Correctional Centre.
Section 24 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act relevantly provided:
""(1) If in respect of a person a Court has nominated a limiting term, the Court:
(a) must refer the person to the Mental Health Review Tribunal, and(b) may make such order with respect to the custody of the person as the Court considers appropriate.""
Pursuant to a referral, the Mental Health Review Tribunal determined that she was suffering from a mental illness.  Pursuant to s 27, on 24 June 2002 Woods DCJ ordered that the respondent be taken to and detained in a hospital.
For 16 days in July 2002, the appellant detained the respondent in cell 16 of D Ward at Long Bay Prison.  Although the cell was described as part of Long Bay Prison Hospital, it was not gazetted as a hospital.
The respondent brought proceedings in the Supreme Court for damages for unlawful imprisonment.  The appellant (state) contended that the nomination of a limiting term deprived the respondent of her liberty.  The appellant further contended that once the respondent had been lawfully deprived of her liberty, she could only complain of the place in which she was detained, which was said to be an insufficient complaint to make out the tort of false imprisonment.  The primary judge upheld the respondent's claim and awarded damages.
The issues for determination on appeal were:
(i) whether, on the proper construction of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, the determination of a limiting term deprived the respondent of her liberty, and(ii) if so, whether the respondent had nevertheless made out the elements of the tort of false imprisonment.
The Court held, dismissing the appeal:
In relation to (i)1. Once the Court had nominated a limiting term, s 24(1)(b) required the Court to order that the respondent be held in custody.  The word ""may"" in s 24(1)(b) only gave the Court discretion to determine the terms of the custodial order.  There was no discretion to order that the respondent not be detained at all.  Nor does the power under s 27 to identify the place of detention include a power to release the person. Accordingly, the respondent, once subject to a limiting term, was deprived of her liberty: [3] (Bathurst CJ); [43], [46] - [47] (Basten JA, Hoeben JA agreeing).
2. Nothing in the statutory language indicates that a s 24(1)(b) order loses its force once the power to make a new order under s 27 is enlivened.  However, there is no need to express any concluded view on the matter: [84] - [86] (Barrett JA).
3. Neither s 23 nor s 24 expressly require that a person the subject of a limiting term must be kept in custody for the entirety of the term.  Even if they do, once an order under s 27 is made, it becomes the only lawful authority for continued detention of the person; the order under s 24(1)(b) is spent: [108] - [109] (Sackville AJA).
R v AN (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 218; 66 NSWLR 523 considered.
In relation to (ii)4. An order entitling the State to deprive a person of his or her liberty did not justify detention in any place the State, or its relevant officer, deemed appropriate, desirable or convenient.  The lawfulness of the detention depended upon compliance with the terms of the order.  The order made under s 27 required the respondent to be detained in a hospital.  There was no order or authority justifying detention in a prison, which is where the respondent was ultimately detained.  The mere fact that the respondent could and should have been detained in another place did not prevent the detention being unlawful.  The necessary elements of the tort of unlawful imprisonment were thus made out: [4]-[5] (Bathurst CJ); [54], [64], [74] - [76] (Basten JA, Hoeben JA agreeing); [88], [93] (Barrett JA); [106] (Sackville AJA). 
Cobbett v Grey (1849) 4 Exch 729; 154 ER 1409; Kelleher v Corrective Services Commission of NSW (1987) 8 NSWLR 423 discussed; R v Templeton [1956] VLR 709; Day v The Queen [1984] HCA 3; 153 CLR 475 referred to; Regina v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison; Ex parte Hague [1992] 1 AC 58 distinguished.




			Judgment
1BATHURST CJ:  I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of Basten JA, Barrett JA, Hoeben JA and Sackville AJA in draft.
2As Basten JA and Barrett JA have pointed out, the principal submission of the State was that by the time the District Court had made an order under s 27(1) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (""the Act"") specifying the place of detention of the respondent, the respondent had already been deprived of her liberty by virtue of an earlier order for her detention under s 24 of the Act.  The State contended that in these circumstances her detention at a place other than that specified in the order under s 27(1) of the Act, whilst unlawful, did not deprive her of her liberty.  As such, the State submitted that it was not liable for the tort of wrongful imprisonment.
3In that context, the State contended that the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v AN (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 218; (2006) 66 NSWLR 523 was incorrect to the extent that it determined that s 27 of the Act conferred power on the Court in its discretion to make an order for detention.  Instead, the State contended that the power to do so resided in s 24 of the Act following nomination of a limiting term under s 23.  On this view, s 27 of the Act merely enables the making of an order as to the place of custody.
4This submission was advanced to support the proposition that detention in a place other than that nominated in the order under s 27 of the Act could not give rise to the alleged liability.  This is because an order for custody had already been made under s 24 and the respondent had been detained as a result of that order.
5The analysis carried out by Basten JA and Barrett JA demonstrates, in my opinion, that this proposition is incorrect.  I would only add that I do not consider that the decision of the House of Lords in Regina v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison;  Ex parte Hague [1992] 1 AC 58 is contrary to their analysis.  I agree with Basten JA that what was determinative in that case was the provision of s 12(1) of the Prison Act 1952 (UK), which provided that a prisoner sentenced to imprisonment ""may be lawfully confined in any prison.""  So much was clear from the speech of Lord Bridge of Harwich (at 163-164), the speech of Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle (at 175) and the judgment of Taylor LJ in the Court of Appeal, Regina v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison;  Ex parte Hague [1992] 1 AC 58 at 119-120.  As Lord Jauncey pointed out (at 175), one of the distinguishing features of Ex parte Hague and the 19th Century cases of Cobbett v Grey (1850) 4 Exch 729 and Osborne v Milman (1886) 17 QBD 514, referred to by Basten JA and Barrett JA in their judgments, was that in the latter cases there was a statutory requirement as to where the prisoners should be confined.  That is the effect of the order under s 27 of the Act in the present case.
6In these circumstances it is not necessary to decide if R v AN (No 2) supra correctly states the scope of s 27 of the Act.  In that case James J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, imposed an order for detention under s 24(1)(b) of the Act and made a direction as to the place of detention under s 27(b):  R v AN (No 2) supra at [86]-[87].  What was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case as to the power to make an order under s 27(b) of the Act for detention was dicta.  To the extent that this Court disagreed, it would also be dicta.  In my opinion, the question should be dealt with in a case where it directly arises.
7Subject to these matters, I agree with the reasons of Basten JA, Barrett JA and Sackville AJA and the orders which they propose.
8BASTEN JA:  The State of New South Wales accepts that, for two periods totalling some 16 days in July 2002, it unlawfully detained the respondent in a prison, rather than a hospital.  Whilst conceding that the respondent may then have been entitled to orders remedying the situation, the State denied that it was liable in damages for her unlawful imprisonment.  The reason for that conclusion, the State submitted, lay in the respondent's liability to deprivation of her liberty in any event.
9The State's submission was rejected by Hall J in the Common Law Division: TD v State of New South Wales [2010] NSWSC 368.  That judgment was given in answer to a separate question as to liability.  Quantum is no longer in issue, the respondent's entitlement (if upheld) having been agreed in an amount of $80,000.  Both because of the amount involved and because the judgment below was not final but interlocutory, the State sought and obtained a grant of leave to appeal.  For the reasons which follow, the appeal should be dismissed.
10The primary judge made an order prohibiting disclosure of information tending to identify the plaintiff in the proceedings before him (the present respondent), pursuant to s 72 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).  It is common ground that the same approach should apply in relation to the proceedings in this Court.  However, s 72 having been repealed, an order to the same effect should be made under s 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW).
(1) Background11The present claim for unlawful imprisonment arose out of an allegation that in November 2000 the respondent snatched a bag containing $15 from a 78-year-old female pensioner.  The act caused an abrasion to the arm of the victim.  In July 2001 the respondent was indicted on a charge of robbery and in November 2001 on a further (alternative) charge of assault with intent to rob.
12The respondent is an Aboriginal woman who suffered from chronic schizophrenia and a mild to moderate developmental disability.  The present proceedings were brought by the Protective Commissioner as her tutor.
13In July 2001, the first charge came before Hock DCJ for a determination as to the respondent's fitness to be tried, in accordance with s 14 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (NSW) (since renamed the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990(NSW)).  She was found unfit to be tried and was referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal"") for that body to determine whether she would become fit to be tried within 12 months from the date of the determination of Judge Hock.
14A further fitness hearing was conducted in respect of the second charge.  Backhouse DCJ found the respondent unfit to be tried and she was referred to the Tribunal to determine whether she would be fit to stand trial within 12 months.  In respect of each matter, the Tribunal determined that she would not become fit to be tried within the respective 12 month periods.
15The findings of the Tribunal triggered a power in the Attorney General (acting with the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions) to decide that a ""special hearing"" should be held in respect of each offence or that no further proceedings would be brought: Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, s 18.  The Attorney directed that a special hearing be conducted.  Upon completion of that hearing, Woods DCJ found that, on the limited evidence available, the respondent had committed the second offence, namely assault with intent to rob.  On 2 May 2002, he further concluded that, if fit to be tried and found guilty, a sentence of imprisonment would have been imposed and nominated the term (known as a ""limiting term"") of 20 months, pursuant to ss 22(1)(c) and 23(1).  The limiting term was fixed to commence on 24 November 2000, being (presumably - the evidence before this Court was unclear) the date when the respondent was taken into custody, and to expire on 23 July 2002, a little less than three months after the completion of the special hearing.
16As a result of the nomination of a limiting term, the Court was required to refer the respondent to the Tribunal for it to determine whether the respondent was suffering from mental illness and, if so, whether treatment was available in a hospital and whether she agreed to go to a hospital: s 24.  Pending a determination by the Tribunal, Judge Woods directed that the respondent be detained at Mulawa Correctional Centre.
17On 30 May 2002 the Tribunal determined that the respondent was suffering from mental illness (chronic schizophrenia) and was mildly to moderately intellectually disabled.  On 24 June 2002 Woods DCJ ordered that the respondent be taken to and detained in a hospital.
18On 1 July 2002 the respondent was transferred to Long Bay Prison and detained in D Ward, cell 16, which, although described as part of Long Bay Prison Hospital, was not gazetted as a hospital under the Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW) (since replaced by the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW)).  She remained there until 12 July 2002.
19On 12 July 2002 the Tribunal reclassified the respondent as a ""continued treatment patient"", under s 89(1) of the Mental Health Act.  She was then transferred to Rozelle Hospital.  However, she immediately absconded and, upon recapture, after being briefly returned to Rozelle Hospital, was transferred back to D Ward, cell 16, at Long Bay.  From 12 July until 16 July 2002 she remained in that cell at Long Bay.  On 16 July 2002, she was discharged from Long Bay and taken to a lodge in Darlinghurst where a placement for her had been found.
20The chronology of events set out above is derived from the agreed statement of facts tendered before the primary judge.  The critical paragraph in that document (par 34) should be set out in full.
""On 4 June 1999 there was published in the NSW Government Gazette, No 66, an order by the Director-General of the Department of Health declaring beds 1-15, only, of the East Wing of D Ward, Long Bay Prison Hospital, to be a 'hospital' pursuant to s 208 of the Mental Health Act 1990.  During both the First Detention Period [being 1-12 July] and Second Detention Period, [12-16 July] cell 16 within D Ward did not form part of a 'hospital' within the meaning of the MHCP Act or the Mental Health Act 1990.""
(2) State's submissions and decision of primary judge21The State's contention was that the nomination of a limiting term, pursuant to s 23 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, had the effect of depriving the respondent of her liberty.  Whilst acknowledging that the Court was thereupon required to refer the respondent to the Tribunal and that the Tribunal was to make findings under s 24 which would result in a further order of the Court under s 27, the State said that the only purpose of the further process was to identify the place of detention.  Once the Tribunal had made its findings, the orders available to the Court under s 27 assumed that the person would continue to be detained, but required that the order specify whether it be in a prison, hospital or other place.  It was not open to the court, the State submitted, to release the prisoner.  (Sections 24 and 27 are set out at [40] and [42] below.)
22The question of release was to be determined pursuant to the provisions of the Mental Health Act.  Once an order had been made under s 27, the person in detention became a ""forensic patient"" within the meaning of that term in the Dictionary to the Mental Health Act.  A forensic patient detained in a hospital or other place became subject to review under s 80(2) to determine whether he or she had become fit to be tried for an offence and whether ""the safety of the person or any member of the public will be seriously endangered by the person's release"".  If satisfied that the person had not become fit to be tried and that neither her safety nor that of any member of the public would be seriously endangered by her release, the Tribunal was required to make a recommendation to the Minister for the person's release: s 80(4).  In the case of a recommendation for release, further steps would be taken by the Minister, including notification of the Attorney General, who may indicate objection to release: s 84.  It followed, the State submitted, that the question of release of any person subject to a limiting term was in the hands of the Minister, and the critical criterion to be assessed by the Tribunal was dangerousness.  That scheme, it was said, was inconsistent with any residual discretion in the court to order release, once the limiting term had been nominated and was running.
23The final step in the State's argument was that the respondent, having lost her entitlement to liberty at the relevant time, could only complain about the place in which she was detained.  That, it was submitted, was a question as to the conditions of detention, a factor which did not go to the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the detention itself, for the purposes of the tort of false imprisonment.
24The primary judge took a different view.  The conclusion, with which the State took issue on appeal, was expressed in the following terms:
""[94] At the time of the making of the order under s 27, the plaintiff had not, by reason of the limiting term, been deprived of her right to liberty.  The order made under s 24 was not a final order but was an interim order.  Her detention, its nature and place for the period of the limiting term was determined at the point in time at which the power under s 27 was exercised by the District Court.
[95] In other words, the order made by Woods DCJ was both an order for the plaintiff's detention and an order that specified both the nature and the place of the plaintiff's detention ('a hospital').  It did not authorise her detention in any other place that could have been ordered under s 27(b).  The distinction between a place that is a 'hospital' as declared and some other place is, of course, one of importance, not only from the perspective of the treatment of a person with mental illness but as a matter of law in determining what constitutes lawful detention.""
25In reaching that conclusion, the primary judge considered himself bound by authority to take a different view from that proposed by the State of the operation of those provisions. 
26The authorities upon which reliance was placed treated the use of the word ""may"" in the chapeau to s 27 as conferring a discretionary power which did not involve an obligation to make one of the orders specified in paragraphs (a) and (b), as appropriate.  Thus, in R v Adams [2003] NSWSC 142; 58 NSWLR 1 at [31] Sperling J stated that the Court ""might not be obliged to make any order at all"".  However that was not a course proposed in that case and it is clear that no final view was being expressed as to that possibility.  
27The primary judge also referred to the authority of Regina v AN (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 218; 66 NSWLR 523.  The procedural history of AN (No 2) was complex and included an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal from the limiting order made in the District Court.  That appeal was upheld and the limiting order was varied, but the Court did not make any order with respect to the custody of the appellant pursuant to s 24(1)(b), pending a determination by the Tribunal.  The principal issue in AN (No 2) was whether the Court, differently constituted, could make an order of the kind which had clearly been intended to be made on the earlier occasion: at [43].  In the principal judgment, delivered by James J, reference was made to the submission that no order for detention could be made under s 27 if there were no extant order requiring the person to be detained in custody: at [45].  Against the possibility that no order were to be made under s 24(1)(b), James J concluded that there was a power conferred by s 27 allowing the Court to order ""both detention and a place of detention"", rather than ""merely ... a power to order a place of detention"": at [47]-[48].  The former, broader, power involved the assumption that there was a power to determine whether a person be detained: at [48].  His Honour returned to that issue at [55], stating:
""The making of orders under s 24(1)(b) which are merely interim orders and cease to have effect on the Court being notified of the determination of the Tribunal, would be consistent with the Court, on being notified of the determination of the Tribunal, having power under s 27 to make an order for the detention of the person in question.""
28He then stated that if no order were made under s 27, ""and if there is no continuing order under s 24(1)(b), the applicant would be entitled to be released, there being no warrant for his being held in custody"": at [57].  Noting (at [59]) that the legislation used the word ""may"" in conferring a power to make an order with respect to custody in s 24(1)(b), but used the mandatory form ""must"" in dealing with the referral to the Tribunal under s 24(1)(a), James J held that ""the conclusion is inescapable that in the Act, when the legislature intended to confer a power which the donee of the power would be obliged to exercise, the legislature used the word 'must' and where the legislature intended to confer a power which the donee of the power might, at its discretion, exercise or not exercise, the legislature used the word 'may'"": at [60].  (There was an erroneous reference in [59] to s 24(2), when s 24(1)(b) was intended, but nothing turns on that.)
29James J clearly adopted that construction as central to his reasoning, concluding that if the Court did not make an order under s 27, the applicant would be entitled to be released: at [77].
30The primary judge concluded, in accordance with orthodox principle, that he was bound to follow the construction adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal: at [86].  Recognising that it might be necessary to challenge the reasoning in AN (No 2) in order to succeed in the present appeal, the Court was invited to sit a five judge bench.  For the reasons set out below, the construction adopted in AN (No 2) was erroneous, but that conclusion does not dictate the outcome of the present case.
(3) Proper construction of section 2731There are three principles of statutory construction which all have work to do in the present case.  First, close attention must be paid to the language used in the legislation.  Secondly, in taking that course it is appropriate to bear in mind that the building blocks of communication are not words but sentences.  Thirdly, attention must be paid to the context in which the language is used.  All of these principles are subsumed within the direction in s 33 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) to adopt a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act.
32The issue of construction turns on the variable use in the legislation of mandatory and directory terminology.  Specifically the question turns on the use of the word ""may"" in s 27.  There are numerous examples of the variable use of the word ""may"" in statutes: DC Pearce and RS Geddes Statutory Interpretation in Australia (7th ed, 2011) at [11.6]-[11.12].  
33As will be seen, the two limbs of s 24(1) (set out at [40] below) adopt both mandatory and directory language respectively.  However, the use of ""must"" in paragraph (a) is readily explained by the fact that there are only two possibilities available, that is either to refer the person to the Tribunal or not to do so.  The mandatory form is used because only one of the alternatives is permitted.  The circumstances in relation to an ""order with respect to the custody of the person"" envisages a range of possible orders.  The use of ""may"" to confer a power does not necessarily import a discretion not to exercise the power if engaged.  Thus, it is well understood that the power may be attended by an obligation to consider its exercise, or in fact to exercise it: Julius v Bishop of Oxford (1880) 5 App Cas 214; Finance Facilities Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1971] HCA 12; 127 CLR 106.  In the latter case, Windeyer J, dealing with a power in relation to assessment of income tax which stated that ""the Commissioner may allow ... a private company ... a further rebate"" in its assessment in certain circumstances, stated at 134:
""Here the scope of the permission or power given is circumscribed.  Conditions precedent for its exercise are specified as alternatives.  The question then is, must the permitted power be exercised if one of those conditions be fulfilled?
This does not depend on the abstract meaning of the word 'may' but [on] whether the particular context of words and circumstance make it not only an empowering word but indicate circumstances in which the power is to be exercised - so that in those events the 'may' becomes a 'must'.""
34A broader inquiry into the occasions on which the drafter of the legislation used ""must"" or ""may"" suggests a degree of flexibility which is unlikely to be determinative of the scope of a particular power as to the circumstances in which it need not be exercised.  The best guide to the proper construction of a particular provision is to be derived from a contextual reading of the various provisions, by reference to the underlying purpose and structure of the legislation.
35The Act provides for an inquiry to be undertaken where a question arises as to the fitness of a person to be tried for an alleged offence, whether before or after arraignment: ss 8 and 9.  The powers of the court, available before the inquiry is conducted, include the power to grant bail or to remand the accused in custody for a period not exceeding 28 days: s 10(3).  The question of fitness to be tried is then determined either by a jury or by the judge if the person so elects: ss 11 and 11A.  Where the person is found unfit to be tried the person must be referred to the Tribunal which must decide whether the person will become fit to be tried within a period of 12 months: ss 14(a) and 16.  Whilst that process is underway, there is again power to grant bail or remand the person in custody: s 14(b)(ii) and (iii).  
36After determining whether the person will become fit to be tried and whether the person is suffering from mental illness or from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital, the Tribunal is required to notify the court of its determination: s 16(3).  If the finding is that the person will not become fit within the specified period, the Tribunal must also notify the Attorney: s 16(4).  In the case of a person found likely to become fit within the specified period, the court has a further power to grant bail: s 17(2).  Alternatively, the court may order that the person be detained in a hospital or another place, depending on the finding as to mental illness or mental condition made by the Tribunal: s 17(3).  Although it is said that the court ""may take the action set out in subsection (2) or (3)"" the section clearly requires that the status of the person, whether to be held in custody or granted bail, must be determined and the court must make an order under one provision or the other: s 17(1).
37With respect to a person who will not be fit to plead within 12 months, the Attorney is then given alternative powers, namely to direct that a special hearing be conducted or that no further proceedings will be taken: s 18(a) and (b).  Again the power to take one step or the other is conferred by the word ""may"" but it is clear that the obligation to take one step or the other is mandatory: if the person could be left in a legal limbo, one would expect the legislation to refer expressly to that possibility.  The nature of a special hearing is identified in the following terms:
""19 Court to hold special hearing on direction of Attorney General
(1) If the Attorney General directs that a special hearing be conducted in respect of an offence with which a person is charged, the appropriate Court must, as soon as practicable after the Attorney General so directs, conduct a special hearing for the purpose of ensuring, despite the unfitness of the person to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, that the person is acquitted unless it can be proved to the requisite criminal standard of proof that, on the limited evidence available, the person committed the offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to the offence charged.""
38Where no further proceedings are to be taken, the Court must order the release of the person: s 20.
39The outcome of a special hearing is defined in the following terms:
""22 Verdicts at special hearing
(1) The verdicts available to the jury or the Court at a special hearing include the following:
(a) not guilty of the offence charged;(b) not guilty on the ground of mental illness;(c) that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed the offence charged;(d) that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed an offence available as an alternative to the offence charged.""
40Where the person is found to have committed the offence charged, the following steps are required:
""23 Procedure after completion of special hearing
(1) If, following a special hearing, it is found on the limited evidence available that an accused person committed the offence charged or some other offence available as an alternative, the Court:
(a) must indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence which the person is found to have committed, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment; and(b) where the Court would have imposed such a sentence, must nominate a term, in this section referred to as a limiting term, in respect of that offence, being the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence....
(4) In nominating a limiting term in respect of a person or imposing any other penalty or making any other order, the Court may, if it thinks fit, take into account the periods, if any, of the person's custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods related to the offence).
(5) A limiting term nominated in respect of a person takes effect from the time when it is nominated unless the Court, after taking into account the periods, if any, of the person's custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods related to the offence), directs that the term be taken to have commenced at an earlier time.
24 Consequences of nomination of limiting term
(1) If in respect of a person a Court has nominated a limiting term, the Court:
(a) must refer the person to the Mental Health Review Tribunal, and(b) may make such order with respect to the custody of the person as the Court considers appropriate.
(2) If a Court refers a person to the Tribunal, the Tribunal must determine whether or not:
(a) the person is suffering from mental illness; or(b) the person is suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital and, where the person is not in a hospital, whether or not the person objects to being detained in a hospital.
(3) The Tribunal must notify the Court which referred the person to it of its determination with respect to the person.""
41Although the statute speaks in terms of the court nominating a limiting term, it is clear that the term is to be treated as equivalent to a sentence in the sense that it requires a deprivation of liberty.  The statute envisages that the term may be reduced by any period of custody or detention which has already occurred: s 23(4).  In describing the term as ""taking effect"" from a specific date, it is envisaged that there will be a continuing period of custody or detention.  In these circumstances, the power in s 24(1)(b) to make an order ""with respect to"" the custody of the person, without any reference to a power to grant bail, is not discretionary in the sense that the person need not be subject to custody.  The order will no doubt identify the period of custody by reference to the term nominated, the date from which the term takes, or has taken, effect and the date upon which it expires.  It may also be appropriate to order the place in which the person is to be detained.  In that provision, ""may"" indicates a conferral of power to make orders, the terms of which will vary with the circumstances of the case, but not the imposition of a discretion to order that the person not be held in custody.
42The further function of the Tribunal under s 24(2) involves a repeat of the function of the Tribunal in respect of the period pending a determination as to whether there should be a special hearing, under s 16(2).  Once the Tribunal has notified the court of its determination, further powers are conferred on the court. 
""27 Orders Court may make following determination of Mental Health Review Tribunal after limiting term is imposed
If a Court is notified by the Mental Health Review Tribunal of its determination in respect of a person under section 24(3), the Court may
(a) if the Tribunal has determined that the person is suffering from mental illness or that the person is suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital and that the person, not being in a hospital, does not object to being detained in a hospital-order that the person be taken to and detained in a hospital; or(b) if the Tribunal has determined that the person is not suffering from mental illness or from a mental condition referred to in paragraph (a) or that the person is suffering from such a mental condition but that the person objects to being detained in a hospital-order that the person be detained in a place other than a hospital.""
43The purpose of the power conferred by s 27 is to allow the court to determine the place in which the person is to be detained.  The terms of the order are constrained by the determination made by the Tribunal, which will engage either of the alternatives specified.  The use of ""may"" involves the conferral of a power, to be exercised according to the circumstances of the case.  There is no indication that the power is discretionary in the sense that the court may decline to order that the person be detained at all.
44Thereafter the court has no further role in respect of the detention of the person, just as it would have no further role in respect of detention after imposing a sentence of imprisonment.  The person would thereafter be a ""forensic patient"" and subject to the Mental Health Act, Ch 5.  The key provisions of the Mental Health Act, as in force at the relevant time, were as follows:
""79 Other legislation relating to criminal proceedings involving persons who may be mentally ill or suffering from some other mental condition
The Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 contains provisions relating to persons involved in criminal proceedings who may be mentally ill or suffering from some other mental condition. Some functions of the Tribunal relating to such persons are contained in this Chapter.
80 Tribunal to review cases of persons found unfit to be tried
(1) This section applies:
(a) to an accused person who has been found, after an inquiry by a court, to be unfit to be tried for an offence and ordered (under section 17 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990) to be detained in a hospital or some other place, and(b) to an accused person in respect of whom, after a special hearing by a court, a limiting term has been imposed and who has been ordered (under section 27 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990) to be detained in a hospital or other place.
(2) The Tribunal must, as soon as practicable after the making of any such order, review the person's case and determine whether, in its opinion:
(a) the person has become fit to be tried for an offence, and(b) the safety of the person or any member of the public will be seriously endangered by the person's release.
(3) If the Tribunal is of the opinion that a person has become fit to be tried for an offence, it must notify the Attorney General accordingly and at the same time furnish a copy of the notification to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
(4) If the Tribunal is of the opinion that a person has not become fit to be tried for an offence and is satisfied, on the evidence available to it, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release, the Tribunal must make a recommendation to the Minister for the person's release.
89 Classification as continued treatment patient
(1) The Tribunal, after reviewing under this Chapter the case of a forensic patient who would, by virtue of the operation of this Act or any other law, cease to be a forensic patient within 6 months after the date of the review and who is:
(a) a person who has been detained in a hospital, prison or other place following a special hearing under section 19 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, or(b) a person who, while serving a sentence of imprisonment has been transferred to a hospital from a prison,
may classify the person as a continued treatment patient.
(2) If, after reviewing under this Chapter the case of any such person the Tribunal classifies the person as a continued treatment patient, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to make any recommendation that would otherwise be required to be made as a consequence of the review.""
45Section 17 (referred to in s 80(1)(a)) deals with persons found to be fit to be tried within 12 months and is not relevant for present purposes.  (The operation of s 80 in respect of such persons is obscure, but no inference relevant for present purposes can be drawn from that operation.  The purpose of s 80(2)(a) and (3) in respect of a person who has already been dealt with pursuant to a special hearing is similarly obscure and may be disregarded.)  The obligation of the Tribunal was to recommend release on finding that the person will not be a serious danger to herself or others: s 80(4).  That recommendation was made to the Minister.  The procedures for consideration of the recommendation were dealt with in s 84 and, if release is to occur, it is undertaken by ""the prescribed authority"", the identity of whom was not discussed in submissions, but was clearly not a court: see Mental Health Regulation 2000 (NSW), cl 19(1).  
46The scheme of the two Acts is thus inconsistent with the proposition that a person subject to a limiting term, once imposed, can be released from detention by a court.  It follows that the power under s 27 to identify the place of detention does not include a power to release the person.  The imposition of the limiting term will lead, in the case of a person previously on remand, to an order with respect to his or her custody, pursuant to s 24(1)(b).  It is only the place of custody which is to be varied following the determination as to the person's mental state, made by the Tribunal pursuant to a referral under s 24(1)(a). 
47The approach adopted by the State, as summarised above, should be accepted.  The reasoning in AN (No 2) is in this respect clearly wrong and should not be followed.
(4) Lawfulness of detention48It follows that the imposition of a limiting term had the effect, as the State submitted, that the respondent was no longer entitled to be at large.  However, it does not follow that her detention at any particular point in time was lawful.  
49The contention of the State that the tort of unlawful imprisonment was not made out in these circumstances was based on two propositions.  The first was that because, during the relevant period, the respondent had not been entitled to her liberty, she had no claim to damages.  She had no entitlement to ""residual liberty"".  The second proposition was that once deprived of one's liberty, the detention does not become unlawful because of unlawful treatment or the imposition of unlawful conditions.
(a) elements of tort50In identifying the elements of the tort, the State referred to a statement from C Sappideen and P Vines, Fleming's The Law of Torts (10th ed, 2011) at [2.80]:
""The action for false imprisonment protects the interest in freedom from physical restraint and coercion against the wrong of intentionally and without lawful justification subjecting another to a total restraint of movement by either causing that person's confinement or preventing that person from leaving the place in which he or she is.""
51In Darcy v State of New South Wales [2011] NSWCA 413, after setting out that passage from Fleming, Whealy JA (with whom Allsop P and Beazley JA agreed) noted that the elements of the tort of false imprisonment ""require proof by the plaintiff of a restraint imposed by the defendant which amounts to imprisonment"" and that ""[u]pon the proof of such imprisonment, the defendant, to escape liability, needs to establish legal justification"": at [143].  (In contradistinction to the facts in Darcy, there was no question of the respondent consenting to being detained in a prison, even if that were, in principle, possible.)
52In acknowledging that the respondent was unlawfully detained, the State conceded that she would, at the relevant time, have had public law remedies available to her to require compliance with the orders of Judge Woods.  However, it was submitted, correctly, that an entitlement to orders in the nature of prerogative relief did not carry with it an entitlement to damages.  The point in issue, however, was slightly different: the question was whether, assuming that relief in the nature of habeas corpus could have been obtained, the conditions of engagement were different from the elements of the tort of false imprisonment.  In support of the latter contention, the State called in aid the reasoning of Black CJ in Ruddock v Vadarlis [2001] FCA 1329; 110 FCR 491, dealing with the availability of relief for asylum seekers rescued by the MV Tampa, but not permitted to disembark in Australia.  His Honour held:
""[69] When this question arises in the context of habeas corpus, however, it may well require a different answer than when it arises in other contexts, such as false imprisonment.  It is clear from the authorities that, unlike an action for false imprisonment, it is not necessary to show actual detention and complete loss of freedom to found the issue of a writ of habeas corpus.  Rather, custody or control are the requisite elements ....
[70] It is important, too, that a distinction is drawn between the elements of the remedy of habeas corpus and those of false imprisonment.  The first is based on an action for release in order to be brought before the Court; the second is a tort involving the notion of fault and the attribution of liability....""
53Putting to one side the question of the need for complete loss of freedom, which is not in issue in the present case, the point of distinction between the remedies is somewhat fragile.  True it is that the procedural purpose of habeas corpus is to bring the person before the court, but the substantive issue on application for the writ concerns the lawfulness of the applicant's detention.  Nor is it entirely correct to say that the tort of false imprisonment involves fault or some other special element concerning attribution of liability.  The tort is, as noted by Kirby J in Ruddock v Taylor [2005] HCA 48; 222 CLR 612 at [140], one of strict liability.  Kirby J continued: ""the focus of this civil wrong is on the vindication of liberty and reparation to the victim, rather than upon the presence or absence of moral wrongdoing on the part of the defendant"". 
54There is no doubt about the complete deprivation of liberty; it follows that the State was required to justify the lawfulness of the respondent's detention.  It did so by reliance on the order made by Judge Woods.  However, an order entitling the State to deprive a person of his or her liberty does not justify detention in any place the State, or its relevant officer, deems appropriate, desirable or convenient.  The lawfulness of the detention depends upon compliance with the terms of the order.
(b) residual liberty and conditions of detention55In support of both propositions on which it relied, the State called in aid the reasoning of the House of Lords in Regina v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison; Ex parte Hague [1992] 1 AC 58.  Mr Hague was a prisoner serving a sentence of 15 years at Parkhurst Prison when the Deputy Governor, believing him to be a troublemaker, ordered that he be transferred to Wormwood Scrubs and held for 28 days in segregation from other prisoners: at 155-156.  He challenged the legality of his segregation and sought damages for false imprisonment.  The Court of Appeal held that the segregation order was invalid (because the Governor of one prison had no power to order segregation in another prison) but refused damages for unlawful imprisonment.
56On appeal to the House of Lords, Lord Bridge of Harwich concluded that a prisoner lawfully within a prison could not complain that his legal rights were infringed ""by a restraint which confines him at any particular time within a particular part of the prison"": at 162-163.  Lord Bridge considered the case that the claimant was unlawfully imprisoned involved either a claim based on some form of ""residual liberty"" or a claim that breach of prison rules could result in the imprisonment becoming unlawful.  Since neither of these claims could be justified, he concluded that the action was based on a breach of the prison rules, which was not an available cause of action: at 163 and 165-166.
57The reliance of the State on Ex parte Hague is not determinative of this case.  Critical to the conclusion in that case that the imprisonment was not unlawful were the terms of s 12(1) of the Prison Act 1952 (UK), which provided that a person sentenced to imprisonment ""may be lawfully confined in any prison"": Ex parte Hague at 162.  
58The circumstances of the present case bear a similarity to those of Cobbett v Grey (1849) 4 Exch 729; 154 ER 1409.  The complaint upon which Mr Cobbett was successful was that the defendants ""compelled him to go from and out of a certain room in the Queen's Prison, called No 2, where he was of right lodged, to and along divers passages, &c, into another part of the prison more confined, dark and insalubrious, being part of the said Queen's Prison limited by law as a prison or place for the separate confinement of debtors remanded ... on the ground of fraud ..."": at 1409.  The case did not turn on the difference in the conditions of confinement (or the company to be had in those conditions), but rather on the legal distinction between the liabilities to custody in the two parts of the prison.  The claims for trespass and false imprisonment were upheld.  
59The State submitted that Cobbett had not been followed in Ex parte Hague.  However, that submission should not be accepted: the House of Lords in Hague recognised the principle in Cobbett, but found it inapplicable in the circumstances in issue before it.
60The second full opinion in Ex parte Hague was delivered by Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle, in the course of which he dealt with two cases relied on by the applicant, including Cobbett (at 175D-E):
""The two remaining 19th century cases were Cobbett v Grey (1850) 4 Exch 729 and Osborne v Milman (1886) 17 QBD 514, in both of which prisoners complained that they were falsely imprisoned in a part of a prison in which they could not lawfully be confined.  In Arbon v Anderson [1943] KB 252, 254, Goddard LJ analysed these two cases and concluded that both related to the nature of the imprisonment rather than to the conditions thereof.  In [Hague in the Court of Appeal [1992] 1 AC at 118H-120C] Taylor LJ again analysed the two cases and concluded that both depended upon the strict classification of prisoners at the time and the statutory requirements as to where they should be confined dependent upon their classification.  I entirely agree with his careful analysis of these two cases and do not feel that I can usefully add anything thereto.""
61Thus, Lord Jauncey accepted the distinction drawn by Goddard LJ in Arbon between the conditions of imprisonment and the nature of the imprisonment: see also Collins v Downs (1982, unrep, NSWSC, Roden J).  To be imprisoned in the wrong part of a prison, where there is strict classification, according to law, is a false imprisonment for which damages may be awarded.  There is nothing in Hague which throws doubt upon that distinction: on the contrary, it was upheld.
62The circumstances in respect of the respondent are somewhat stronger than those in Cobbett.  This was not a case in which she was held in one part of a prison, rather than another.  Rather, she was held in a prison when the law required that she be detained in a hospital.  The fact that she may have been treated in the same way as she would have been in a hospital (as to which there was no material before the Court) might affect the quantum of damages, but not the answer to the legal question.  
63In Kelleher v Corrective Services Commission of NSW (1987) 8 NSWLR 423, an unlawful transfer of a prisoner from the Central Industrial Prison to Goulburn Training Centre was held not to affect the validity or operation of a lawful order for his committal to prison pending trial and the authority of the consequential warrant.  The trial judge (Lee J) had declared that the transfer was ""without lawful authority"" and had ordered that Mr Kelleher be returned to his former custody at the Central Industrial Prison.  An appeal from those orders was dismissed.  (There was no claim for damages in respect of the period during which he was held at Goulburn Training Centre.)  
64Prior to Kelleher, the circumstances in which a person, lawfully committed to a prison pursuant to a valid warrant, may thereafter cease to be held in lawful custody, had been considered in R v Templeton [1956] VLR 709 and Day v The Queen [1984] HCA 3; 153 CLR 475.  These cases demonstrate that the lawfulness of the custody will turn upon (i) the relevant statutory provisions, (ii) the terms of the order or warrant of commitment and (iii) the manner in which what had commenced as lawful custody may have become unlawful: Powch v The Queen [1987] HCA 41; 163 CLR 496 at 498 (Mason CJ, delivering the judgment of the Court).  These factors need to be addressed in turn.
(i) relevant statutory provisions65The Act under which the order was made, the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, defined a hospital as having the same meaning as in the Mental Health Act: s 3(1).  The relevant definitions, to be found in the Dictionary to the Mental Health Act, provided as follows:
""hospital means:
(a) any premises the subject of an order in force under section 208 by which the premises are declared to be a hospital, or(b) an authorised hospital.
...
authorised hospital means premises in respect of which a licence has been granted to any person under Division 2 of Part 1 of Chapter 8.""
66There was little reference in the course of argument as to the legal consequences of being detained in a prison rather than a hospital.  For example, not having been committed to a correctional centre, the respondent was not an ""inmate"" within the terms of s 4(1) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW).  She was not, therefore, in the custody of the general manager of the correctional centre in which she was held: s 72(1).  In 2005 that Act was amended to give the Commissioner the care, control and management of ""offenders"" held in custody in accordance with Parts 2, 3 or 4 of that Act: s 232(1)(a1).  However, she would not have fallen within that provision either. It is at least doubtful whether any person in control of a prison or any correctional officer exercising functions under the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act had any power with respect to the respondent at all.  It is inconsistent with the structure of that legislation that any person may be detained in a prison, lawfully, unless they are committed to a correctional centre by warrant or order of a court.  There is, therefore, at least doubt as to whether it was correct to say that she had no right to be released from prison.  The standard provisions relating to warrants in respect of persons committed to a correctional centre (see ss 261 and 262) were not applicable.  
67The provisions of the Mental Health Act dealing with forensic patients held in Long Bay Prison Hospital (s 95(3) and (4)) were also not applicable to her because she was not so detained.  
68Nor was there any warrant for her transfer to a hospital, as distinct from the order of Judge Woods.  The process by which a person would be transferred from a prison to a hospital, pursuant to an order of the kind made in this case, was not explored.  Thus, whilst the legal consequences of the respondent's detention in a prison rather than a hospital cannot be finally determined, they are not to be dismissed by the factual assertion that the cell in which she was detained was in fact next to a cell which was a gazetted hospital.
(ii) terms of order69Judge Woods, on nominating a limiting term, and before the determination of the Tribunal, ordered that the respondent be detained at Mulawa Correctional Centre.  That order, made under s 24(1)(b), was the subject of a warrant executed by a clerk of the District Court.  Following notification of the determination of the Tribunal, a further order was made by Judge Woods, on 24 June 2002.  There was no warrant or other authority for a transfer.  The order was in the following terms:
""In accordance with s 27 of the said Act, I therefore order that [the respondent] be taken to and detained in a hospital.""
70This order should be construed (there being no submission to the contrary) as picking up the language of the statute under which it was made.  The order did not permit or authorise detention in any place which was not a hospital under the Mental Health Act.  Had it purported to do so, there might have been a question as to its validity.
71There was no dispute that the order made by Judge Woods on 24 June 2002 was valid and effective in its terms.  It required the respondent to be detained in a hospital, which included any premises falling within the definition in the Mental Health Act.  No overriding statutory provision was relied upon, permitting her detention in a prison.  On that basis, the State, appropriately, conceded that her detention was unlawful. 
(iii) manner in which custody became unlawful72The respondent was not initially detained in compliance with the valid order of 24 June 2002.  From 24 June 2002 until she was transferred to a lodge on 16 July 2002, the respondent was held in a hospital only for a short period on 12 July 2002.  No issue was raised as to the validity of the detention between 24 June and 1 July 2002 when she continued to be held at Mulawa.  For the remainder of the period, she was detained in a prison.  
(5) Conclusions73It may be accepted that, other than in truly exceptional circumstances, lawful detention will not cease to be such because of the conditions in which the person is held.  As demonstrated by Cobbett v Grey, and accepted in Ex parte Hague, that does not mean that a person can be held otherwise than in a place to which he or she is committed.  The schemes provided for detention in this State under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act and the Mental Health Act, in relation to forensic patients, and under the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act in respect of prisoners, support that conclusion.
74The authority to detain the respondent depended upon a combination of the limiting term nominated by Judge Woods on 2 May 2002 and, following the notification of the Tribunal's determination of 30 May 2002, the requirement that the detention be at a place ordered by the District Court pursuant to s 27 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act.  Thus, from 24 June 2002 the respondent was to be detained in a hospital.
75During the periods complained of, the respondent was not held in a hospital, but in a prison.  There was no lawful order or authority justifying detention in a prison, nor did the statutory scheme for detention of inmates and offenders operate with respect to the respondent.  Accordingly that detention was, as conceded by the State, unlawful.
76The mere fact that the respondent could and should have been detained in another place did not prevent the detention being unlawful.  The necessary elements of the tort of unlawful imprisonment were thus established.  It follows that the decision of the primary judge was correct and the appeal must be dismissed.
77The Court should make the following orders:
(1) Dismiss the appeal.
(2) Order the appellant to pay the respondent's costs in this Court.
78BARRETT JA:  As Basten JA explains at [54] of his reasons, it was for the appellant, as defendant in the Common Law Division proceedings, to show that it had lawful justification for the involuntary detention to which the respondent was subjected during the relevant period in July 2002, that is, detention in the particular cell at Long Bay that was not part of a ""hospital"" as defined by the Mental Health Act 1990.
79The primary judge decided that the appellant had failed to establish such lawful justification.  His Honour's decision was correct.
80Such authority as the appellant had to detain the respondent came from the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 as in force at the relevant time.  The applicable provisions of that Act are set out in the judgment of Basten JA and need not be repeated.  
81The making by the District Court of the orders of 2 May 2002 and 24 June 2002 caused the appellant to have statutory power (as well as a statutory duty) to deal with the respondent in accordance with the orders.
82The order of 2 May 2002 directed that the respondent ""be detained at Mulawa Correctional Centre"".  This was, in terms of s 24(1)(b) of the Act, ""an order with respect to the custody of the person"" and therefore an order authorised by that section.
83The order of 24 June 2002 was that the respondent ""be taken to and detained in a hospital"".  That order was in precisely the terms contemplated and allowed by s 27(a).  By force of s 3(1), ""hospital"" had, in s 27(a), the same meaning as in the Mental Health Act 1990.
84It was said in R v AN (No 2)  [2006] NSWCCA 218; (2006) 66 NSWLR 523 at [55] that an order under s 24(1)(b) ceased to have effect once the power to make a new order under s 27 was enlivened; and that this was so whether or not that power was exercised.  That matter is of continuing importance because those and related provisions remain in force in what is now the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.  
85I must say that I see nothing in the statutory language to indicate that a s 24(1)(b) order somehow loses the force the Act gives it just because the court becomes able to act anew under s 27.  It seems clear enough, however, that, once the court does so act and, pursuant to s 27, orders either that the person be taken to and detained in a hospital or that the person be taken to and detained at some other place, that new order supersedes and displaces the earlier s 24(1)(b) order.  
86There is no need to express any concluded view on these matters.  The point of significance, for present purposes, is that neither the order made under s 24(1)(b) on 2 May 2002 nor the order made under s 27(a) on 24 June 2002 directed or permitted detention of the respondent at the place at which she was in fact held during the relevant period in July 2002.  One order specified Mulawa  Correctional Centre; the other a ""hospital"" in the Mental Health Act sense.  The particular cell at Long Bay was within neither of these specifications.
87In Scavage v Tateham (1601) Cro Eliz 829; 78 ER 1056, a justice of the peace held a suspect in the justice's own house rather than in the common gaol of the county which was subject to gaol delivery.  In Yorke v Chapman (1839) Ad & E 207; 113 ER 80, a person imprisoned for debt and held in a strong room of the debtors' prison alleged that the conditions for close confinement in that room were not satisfied.  Cobbett v Gray (1849) 4 Exch 729; 154 ER 1409 was a case in which a person was held in one part of a prison when the authority for his imprisonment allowed confinement only in another part.  In Osborne v Milman (1887) 18 QBD 471, a person committed to prison for practising as a solicitor without being duly qualified was subjected to labour as a convicted criminal when the law required that he be treated as ""a misdemeanant of the first division"".
88In each of those cases, an action for false imprisonment was held to be maintainable on the footing that lawful authority for detention in one place or of one kind did not extend to detention in another place or of another kind.
89A sentence of imprisonment may, by statute, have the effect that the person concerned may not only be held in custody but also placed in any prison and under any conditions there prevailing, according to administrative decisions duly made.  In his article ""Administrative segregation of prisoners: powers, principles of review and remedies"" (1996) 20(3) Melbourne University Law Review 639, Matthew Groves summarised the general position thus (at 660n):
""Australian statutes tend to create a presumption placing anyone subject to a sentence of imprisonment in the legal custody of, and subject to the directions of, the head of the corrections department. That person is normally also given a power to locate and transfer prisoners as he or she thinks fit.""
90The New South Wales provisions referred to by the learned author were s 27 and s 39(1) of the Prisons Act 1952 (now repealed) which he saw as having the same broad operation as s 12(1) of the Prison Act 1952 (UK), the provision pivotal to the decision of the House of Lords in R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison; Ex parte Hague [1992] 1 AC 58:
""A prisoner, whether sentenced to imprisonment or committed to prison on remand or pending trial or otherwise, may be lawfully confined in any prison.""  
91New South Wales provisions affecting persons sentenced to imprisonment and creating administrative discretions concerning placement and conditions are now found in the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 and regulations thereunder.  Section 232(1) of the Act states that the Commissioner of Corrective Services ""has the care, control and management"" of all offenders held in custody pursuant to Parts 2, 3 and 4 of the Act.  The Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008 makes detailed provision with respect to the exercise of that function.  Extensive as the statutory authority is, however, it obviously has  limits.  The Commissioner could not, for instance, follow the example in Scavage v Tateham (above) by detaining a prisoner in the Commissioner's own house.     
92The respondent, of course, was not a person upon whom a sentence of imprisonment had been imposed.  The District Court had conducted a ""special hearing"" under s 19 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act.  Having done so, the court acted pursuant to s 23(1)(b) to nominate a ""limiting term"".  That nomination had the effect that certain further statutory processes were required and certain statutory powers became exercisable.  It did not, of itself, authorise or justify detention.
93Among the statutory powers that became exercisable were those created by s 24(1)(b) and s 27(a).  Orders were made under those sections.  They authorised detention of the respondent at particular places only.  Neither the court's nomination of a ""limiting term"" nor any other circumstance created any kind of overarching authority to detain that existed independently of the specific authority arising under each of s 24(1)(b) and s 27(a).
94By proving that the District Court had nominated a ""limiting term"" and had made the orders of 2 May 2002 and 24 June 2002, the appellant did not establish lawful justification for the detention in the particular cell at Long Bay to which the respondent was subjected in  July 2002.  Proof of those matters did not warrant a conclusion that that detention was in accordance with the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act as in force at the relevant time or otherwise authorised by law.
95The orders that Basten JA proposes should be made.
96HOEBEN JA:  I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Basten JA.  I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour.
97As Basten JA has observed (at [30]), the correctness or otherwise of the reasoning in Reg v AN (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 218; 66 NSWLR 523 does not dictate the outcome of the present appeal.  For that reason, I do not think it necessary to express a view as to whether the reasoning is correct.
98SACKVILLE AJA:  I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Basten JA.  I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour.  I wish briefly to state my reasons for agreeing with the orders.  I do not repeat Basten JA's account of the facts and the relevant legislation.
99On 2 May 2002, Woods DCJ made orders as follows:
(i) an order under s 23(1)(b) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure Act 1990 (""MH (CP) Act"") nominating a limiting term of 20 months in respect of the offence found to have been committed by the respondent;
(ii) an order under s 23(5) of the MH (CP) Act, directing that the limiting terms be taken to have commenced on 24 November 2000, with an expiration date of 23 July 2002;
(iii) an order under s 24(1) of the MH (CP) Act, referring the respondent to the Mental Health Review Tribunal; and
(iv) an order under s 24(1)(b) of the MH (CP) Act, directing that the respondent be detained at the Mulawa Correctional Centre.
100On 24 June 2002, his Honour made an order under s 27(a) of the MH (CP) Act in the following terms:
""In the matter of [TD], the Court has received a notification from the Mental Health Review Tribunal under section 24(3) of the [MH (CP) Act] that she is a person suffering from a mental illness.
In accordance with s 27 of the said Act, I therefore order that [TD] be taken to and detained in a hospital.""
101The State's arguments proceeded by the following steps:
(i) The orders of 2 May 2002 (""First Order"") required the respondent to be kept in custody until the expiry of the limiting term on 23 July 2002.
(ii) The effect of the First Order was that the respondent was deprived of her liberty until she ceased to be a ""forensic patient"" by reason of the expiry of the limiting term: Mental Health Act 1990, s 103(a).
(iii) The order of 24 June 2002 (""Second Order"") merely nominated the place at which the respondent was to be detained until the expiry of the limiting term.  The Second Order did not deprive the respondent of her liberty; the deprivation occurred by reason of the First Order.
(iv) The placement of the respondent in a prison rather than a hospital admittedly contravened the terms of the Second Order and was therefore unlawful.  Nonetheless, the unlawful placement did not deny the respondent the liberty she no longer had.
(v) It is an essential element of an action for false imprisonment that the defendant's acts deprive the plaintiff of his or her liberty.  In this case, the acts of the State, although unlawful, did not deprive the respondent of her liberty.  Accordingly, while she may have had public law remedies available (such as a writ of habeas corpus), the respondent's action based on false imprisonment had to fail.
102I agree with Basten JA that even if the first three steps of the State's argument are accepted, it does not follow that the respondent's claim in false imprisonment must fail.  Mr Craddock SC, who appeared with Mr Beckett for the State, acknowledged that the decision in Cobbett v Grey (1849) 4 Exch 729; 154 ER 1409, was squarely against the State's argument.
103In that case an order was made under a rule having the force of statute for the confinement of a debtor in a particular part of a prison appropriate to his classification.  The custodian removed the debtor to a different, less salubrious part of the prison limited by law to debtors of a different classification (those who failed to file a statement of affairs).  It was held that the removal of a prisoner from one part of a prison to another in which by law he could not be confined was a trespass: at 736; 1412, per Parke B.
104Later authorities distinguish between the situation in Cobbett v Grey and that in which a prisoner is lawfully confined within the defined bounds of a prison but is moved by the custodian, without the sanction of prison rules, from one part of the prison to another, where the regime is more stringent.  In the latter case, as shown by Reg v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison; Ex parte Hague [1992] 1 AC 58, the prisoner cannot claim damages for false imprisonment.  The critical factor in Ex parte Hague, was that the governing legislation provided that the prisoner ""may be lawfully confined in any prison"": at 162-163, per Lord Bridge; at 175, per Lord Jauncey.  Thus the claim in Ex parte Hague concerned merely the conditions of imprisonment, rather than the nature of the imprisonment: at 176, citing Arbon v Anderson [1943] KB 252, at 254, per Goddard LJ.
105The basis of this distinction is that the tort of false imprisonment has two ingredients: ""the fact of imprisonment and the absence of lawful authority to justify it"": Ex parte Hague, at 162.  As Allsop P observed in Darcy v State of New South Wales [2011] NSWCA 413, at [2]:
""[t]he question of lawful justification for the detention of a person is a question of the utmost importance.  It involves the recognition of the importance of the liberty of the subject, an aspect of society and human rights recognised, indeed cherished, by the common law.""
It is not surprising that the law carefully scrutinises the terms of an order providing for a person's detention or imprisonment to ensure that he or she is kept in custody in an authorised place of confinement.
106In the present case, the First Order provided for the respondent to be detained at Mulawa Correctional Centre.  The Second Order provided that the respondent was to be detained in a hospital.  The Second Order, insofar as it stipulated a hospital as the place of detention rather than a prison, clearly supplanted the First Order.  Whatever the continuing effect of the First Order or the specification of Mulawa Correctional Centre as the place of detention, it could no longer justify the detention of the respondent in a prison.  Accordingly, the respondent's detention in a prison, once the Second Order had come into effect, was unlawful.  The unlawful detention concerned the nature of the respondent's imprisonment, not the conditions of her imprisonment within an institution to which she was lawfully confined.  It  follows that, in accordance with the authorities, the respondent established the elements of the tort of false imprisonment and the primary Judge was correct so to hold.
107As Basten JA has noted (at [30]), the correctness or otherwise of the reasoning in Reg v AN (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 218; 66 NSWLR 523, does not dictate the outcome of the present appeal.  For that reason, I do not think it necessary to express a view as to whether the reasoning is correct.  However, I make the following observations.
108Neither s 23 nor s 24 of the MH (CP) Act expressly provides that a person in respect of whom the Court has nominated a limiting term must be kept in custody for the entirety of that term.  Section 24(1)(b), which provides that the Court ""may make such order with respect to the custody of the person as the Court considers appropriate"", also does not expressly state that the order is to be made on the basis that the person will necessarily be held in custody until the expiry of the limiting term.
109It may well be that when the legislation is read as a whole, the powers conferred by ss 24 and 27 of the MH (CP) Act are to be construed as limited to determining where the person is to be kept in custody and the conditions under which he or she is to be detained, rather than permitting the person to be released from custody before the expiry of the limiting term.  But that does not necessarily mean that an order under s 24(1)(b) cannot be expressed to continue only until a further order is made under s 27.  If an order under s 24(1)(b) can be made in this form, once an order under s 27 is made the only lawful authority for the continued detention of the person would be the s 27 order.  In these circumstances, the original order made under s 24(1)(b) would be spent.

2761024,Marshall v Megna; Megna v Tory; Tory v Megna [2013] NSWCA 30,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellants, Mr Marshall and Mr Tory, were involved in the publication and distribution of a circular under the auspices of a non-existent organisation, the Drummoyne Council Ratepayers Association. Between 1998 and 2003, approximately 28 such circulars were distributed in the Drummoyne municipality.

The respondents, Mr Megna and Mr Lloyd, brought defamation proceedings against the appellants, alleging that the publications contained defamatory imputations of them. A jury found that the circulars contained 54 defamatory imputations of Mr Megna and 35 of Mr Lloyd. The trial judge entered verdicts in favour of each of the respondents for some but not all imputations contained in the circulars. 

The appellants appealed against her Honour's rejection of their defence of qualified privilege. The respondents cross-appealed against that part of her Honour's decision upholding the defence of qualified privilege.

On appeal to this Court, eight issues arose for determination: 

(1)Whether the imputations on the appeal were published on an occasion of qualified privilege?

(2) If so, whether the imputations on the appeal were relevant to the occasion of qualified privilege?

(3) Whether her Honour erred in finding that the imputations on the cross-appeal were published on an occasion of qualified privilege?

(4) Whether the appellants were motivated by malice?

(5) Whether the defences of qualified privilege and fair comment were made out in respect of the imputations alleged in the cross-claim?

(6) Whether her Honour erred in holding that the claim based on the first circular was statute-barred?

(7) Whether the damages awarded were excessive? 

(8) Whether her Honour erred in ordering that the appellants pay the whole of the respondents' costs?

In the proceedings before this Court, s 78B Notices were issued to the Attorneys General of the States and Territories pursuant to the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) because of the appellants submission on the scope of qualified privilege. None of the Attorneys General sought to intervene.

The Court dismissed the appeal and allowed the cross-appeal.

Held per Beazley JA, Allsop P and Hoeben JA agreeing:

In respect of (1):

i.None of the imputations were published on an occasion of qualified privilege: [133], [134].

ii.The trial judge erred in finding that 'public interest' in a topic is sufficient to found an occasion of qualified privilege: [133]. There is no duty for any person to convey their personal political views nor is there any reciprocal interest in persons receiving such unsolicited comments: [133].
Cited: Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25; 189 CLR 520; Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1977] 2 NSWLR 749.

iii.The requirement of reciprocity means that only in exceptional cases will the publication of defamatory matter to the general public attract the privilege: [37].
Cited: Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25; 189 CLR 520.

iv.The principle stated in the 'election cases' did not apply as there was no pending election: [109].

v.There is no independent third category of qualified privilege attaching to political comment, that does not fall within the 'election cases', and in respect of which there is no requirement of reasonableness: [120]. 
Cited: Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25; 189 CLR 520; Roberts v Bass [2002] HCA 57; 212 CLR 1; The Korean Times Pty Ltd & Anor v Un Dok Pak [2011] NSWCA 365.

In respect of (2) and (3):

i.For there to be an occasion of qualified privilege which protects a person from liability for defamatory publications, there must be a sufficient connection to the privileged occasion to attract the defence: [147]. Anything ""not relevant and pertinent"" to the discharge of the duty or the safeguarding of the interest, which creates the privilege will not be protected: [153].
Cited: Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309; Bashford v Information Australia (Newsletters) Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 5; 218 CLR 366.

ii.Inaccurate statements or excessive or extravagant language do not of themselves prevent there being a sufficient connection to the privileged occasion: [148], [156].
Cited: Bashford v Information Australia (Newsletters) Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 5; 218 CLR 366; Cush v Dillon [2011] HCA 30; 243 CLR 298, Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309

iii.In determining whether a sufficient connection exists, the text containing the defamatory imputations must be read in the context of the item in which they arose: [176]. 

In respect of (4)

iv.The matters complained of were actuated by an improper motive: [297]. The factors relevant to this conclusion included the personal interest in the dissemination of the circulars, the language and tone of the matters demonstrated that the authors 'harboured ill will, bias and prejudice', the anonymity of the authorship, the deception involved in its publication under the auspices of a non-existent organisation and the repetitive and crushing nature of the campaign against the respondents: [288]-[289].

In respect of (5)

i.The defence of qualified privilege was made out by the first respondent as the matter complained of was in response to an attack: [305]. An occasion existed to repel the appellants' circulars, which characterised the respondent as dishonest, self-interested, corrupt and incompetent: [314]. The respondent's publication was in reply to this occasion because it criticised the first appellant's conduct as a Councillor: [314].

ii.The defence of comment was made out because two conditions were satisfied: [325]-[326]. First, the defamatory matter was ""recognisable as comment and not as a statement of fact"" by the reader of the publication: [315]. For example, the defamatory matter must be seen as a ""deduction, inference, conclusion, criticism, remark, observation, etc"": [314]. Second, the matter was proper material for comment because it related to a matter of public interest: [306]. Although the trial judge gave limited attention to this defence, her conclusion that the defence was made out is upheld: [317], [323].
Cited: Defamation Act 1974, s 30-32; Lloyd-Jones v Allen [2012] NSWCA 230; Clarke v Norton [1910] VLR 494.

In respect of (6)

iii.An award of damages for defamation involves an evaluative/ discretionary assessment of the harm caused to reputation and the hurt and distress of the defamation: [336], [338].
Cited: Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd v Mahommed [2010] NSWCA 335; 278 ALR 232; Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 52; 216 CLR 327.

iv.The trial judge did not err in considering each circular separately and making an award of damages in respect of each, regardless of the number of imputations conveyed by the particular matter complained of: [327].
Cited: Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd v Mahommed [2010] NSWCA 335; 278 ALR 232.

v.Appellate intervention is only warranted when the ""amount awarded is so high or so low that it is outside the range of what could reasonably be regarded as appropriate to the circumstances of the case"": [332]. The trial judge's determination was outside an appropriate discretionary range: [339].
Cited: Carson v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd [1993] HCA 31; 178 CLR 44.

vi.Damages fall to be reassessed in this case because of the Court's conclusion on qualified privilege and malice: [334].

In respect of (7)

vii.The relevant limitation period for a defamation claim is six years: [343].
Cited: Limitation Act 1969, s 14.

viii.Distribution and publication are not, or at least are not usually contemporaneous: [329], [330]. Publication only occurs when the matter is read and comprehended by someone: [329].
Cited: Dow Jones and Company Inc v Gutnick [2002] HCA 56; 210 CLR 575. 

ix.The trial judge did not err in finding that the first circular subject of the proceedings was statute barred because there was no evidence from which an inference could be drawn that persons read the circular on or after 8 April 1998: [330].

In respect of (8)

i.This ground of appeal became redundant due to the nature of the disposition of this appeal. The ordinary rule that costs follow the event should apply: [349].

HOEBEN JA: concurring reasons

[398]

1ALLSOP P: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Beazley JA to be delivered. I agree with the orders proposed by her Honour and subject to what follows with her reasons. I agree with her Honour's view that none of the communications was made on an occasion of qualified privilege. Whilst I agree with her Honour's reasons in this regard, I would prefer to express aspects of the reasoning in my own words. 

2There being no occasion of qualified privilege, it is unnecessary to express any views as to the individual communications and imputations and whether they were relevant to or sufficiently connected with the occasion, assuming the correctness of the primary judge's views on qualified privilege. Nevertheless, if it be necessary to engage in this task, generally, I am content to agree with Beazley JA's approach and conclusions in this respect.

Qualified Privilege

3Reciprocity of duty and interest is the hallmark of the common law defence of qualified privilege; it is essential: Cush v Dillon [2011] HCA 30; 243 CLR 298 at 305 [11]; Bashford v Information Australia (Newsletters) Pty Limited [2004] HCA 5; 218 CLR 366 at 373 [9] and 416-417 [136]-[137]; Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309 at 334; Papaconstuntinos v Holmes à Court [2012] HCA 53; 293 ALR 215 at [8] and cases at footnote 5; Roberts v Bass [2002] HCA 57; 212 CLR 1 at 26 [62].

4The informing legal policy is the protection of freedom of communication. The recognition of its importance means that in some circumstances freedom of communication is more important than an individual's right to the protection of his or her reputation: Cush v Dillon at 305 [12]; Aktas v Westpac Banking Corporation [2010] HCA 25; 241 CLR 79 at 89 [22]; Justin v Associated Newspapers Ltd [1967] 1 NSWR 61 at 75.

5The concept of reciprocity of interest or duty and the cognate notions involved such as the common convenience and welfare of society, public or private duty whether legal or moral, and the relevant community of interest of the parties are general and stated at a high level of abstraction: Bashford at 373 [10]. Their application to a particular given conclusion requires close scrutiny of the facts of the case, the situation of the parties and the relationships and circumstances leading up to and surrounding the publication: Guise v Kouvelis [1947] HCA 13; 74 CLR 102 at 116-117; Bashford at 373 [10].

6The individualisation of the broad and general concepts and principles to a particular conclusion through close scrutiny of the facts is effected by the application of the informing notions and the legal policy of the privilege to those facts: Guise v Kouvelis at 116-117. The process of reduction from the general principles to the particular question of the existence of an occasion of privilege is an evaluative one directed at assessing whether a social or moral right or duty existed: Baird v Wallace-James (1916) 85 LJPC 193 at 198; Guise v Kouvelis at 117. The correct answer is not dictated by a bright line rule enabling logical deduction or application. It is reached by ascertainment of a category of circumstance, being the existence of a sufficient community of interest to justify the recognition of an occasion of privilege, that has an indeterminate reference: Aktas at 89 [22], J Stone, The Province and Function of Law (Harvard University Press, 1950) at 185-186. The process was described by Jordan CJ in Andreyevich v Kosovich (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 357 at 363 as the ascertainment, through the evidence, that ""the givers and the receivers of the defamatory information had a special and reciprocal interest in its subject matter, of such a kind that it was desirable as a matter of public policy, in the general interests of the whole community ... that it should be made with impunity, notwithstanding that it was defamatory of a third party."" The word ""interest"" is used in the broad popular sense, referring not to a matter of gossip or curiosity, but to a matter of substance beyond mere news value. The interest is to be definite, not vague or insubstantial, though it may be direct or indirect. It must be ""of so tangible a nature that for the common convenience and welfare of society it is expedient to protect it"": Howe v Lees [1910] HCA 67; 11 CLR 361 at 377 and 398; Andreyevich at 363-364.

7Political subject matter provides fertile ground for the interplay of these general considerations apposite to the privilege. The informing legal policy of freedom of communication is vital to the health and well-being of democratic civil society. The common convenience and welfare of our society and the health of its political life depend ultimately on freedom of choice, which in turn depends upon the free availability and exchange, of information and ideas relevant to political and social choice. At one level of abstraction, all persons entitled to vote and indeed those who are not yet but will be so entitled, have a common community interest in the exchange of information and opinions on society, politics, government and politicians. Without more, however, it would be a surprising conclusion (without a broadly framed protection for any communication about politics) that an occasion of qualified privilege arose in respect of the dissemination of information or opinions relevant to politics from any person in Australia to any number of other persons in Australia. Such would be to posit shared public political interest as the foundation of qualified privilege however large or anonymous the group to whom the dissemination took place. More would need to be known about the circumstances, though it is to be noted that, as shown by the discussion in the judgment of McHugh J in Stephens v West Australian Newspapers Ltd [1994] HCA 45; 182 CLR 211 at 261-264, qualified privilege may attach to publications to the world at large.

8The common law has recognised the importance of the political process in the ambit of qualified privilege in the so-called election cases to which I will come in due course.

9It was the perceived Constitutional importance of political discourse that saw the development of a Constitutional principle constraining the authority of Parliaments and the Executive in the exercise of their respective powers and the moulding of the law of defamation by reference to Constitutional imperatives in such cases as Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25; 189 CLR 520.

10The principles enunciated in the judgment of the Court in Lange (later modified, irrelevantly for present purposes, in Coleman v Power [2004] HCA 39; 220 CLR 1, and, as to which, see also later cases such as APLA Limited v Legal Services Commissioner (NSW) [2005] HCA 44; 224 CLR 322; and Wotton v Queensland [2012] HCA 2; 285 ALR 1) developed from a series of cases in which the underlying Constitutional principles, their elements and effects, including upon the common law of defamation, were variously expressed: see Australian Capital Television Pty Limited v The Commonwealth [1992] HCA 45; 177 CLR 106; Nationwide News Pty Limited v Wills [1992] HCA 46; 177 CLR 1; Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Ltd [1994] HCA 46; 182 CLR 104; and Stephens.

11In Stephens, McHugh J, if I may be permitted respectfully to say, after a discussion of qualified privilege of great clarity and assistance at 260-264, propounded a development of the common law of qualified privilege based on the appropriateness of recognising the freedom of discussion of the exercise of public functions and powers vested in public officials. These were not expressions of view of the existing state of the common law, but were an expression of his Honour's view as to the appropriate adaption of the common law of qualified privilege to changes in the conditions in Australian society. The primary judge set these passages out at [141] and [142] of her reasons. McHugh J said at 264-265:

""In the last decade of the twentieth century, the quality of life and the freedom of the ordinary individual in Australia are highly dependent on the exercise of functions and powers vested in public representatives and officials by a vast legal and bureaucratic apparatus funded by public moneys. How, when, why and where those functions and powers are or are not exercised are matters that are of real and legitimate interest to every member of the community. Information concerning the exercise of those functions and powers is of vital concern to the community. So is the performance of the public representatives and officials who are invested with them. It follows in my opinion that the general public has a legitimate interest in receiving information concerning matters relevant to the exercise of public functions and powers vested in public representatives and officials. Moreover, a narrow view should not be taken of the matters about which the general public has an interest in receiving information. With the increasing integration of the social, economic and political life of Australia, it is difficult to contend that the exercise or failure to exercise public functions or powers at any particular level of government or administration, or in any part of the country, is not of relevant interest to the public of Australia generally. If this legitimate interest of the public is to be properly served, it must also follow that on occasions persons with special knowledge concerning the exercise of public functions or powers or the performance by public representatives or officials of their duties will have a corresponding duty or interest to communicate information concerning such functions, powers and performances to members of the general public. In Jenoure v Delmege [1891] AC 73 at 77, Lord Macnaghten said that '[t]o protect those who are not able to protect themselves is a duty which everyone owes to society'.

Accordingly, it is now appropriate for the common law to declare that it is for 'the common convenience and welfare' of Australian society that the existing categories of qualified privilege be extended to protect communications made to the general public by persons with special knowledge concerning the exercise of public functions or powers or the performance of their duties by public representatives or officials invested with those functions and powers. The scientist who discovers that lack of governmental action is threatening the environment, the 'whistleblower' who observes the bureaucratic or ministerial 'cover up', and the investigative journalist who finds that grants of public money have been distributed contrary to the public interest are examples of persons who have special knowledge of matters affecting the exercise of public functions or powers or the performance of duties by public representatives or officials. If such persons, acting honestly, inform the general public of what they know about such matters, their publications will be made on an occasion of qualified privilege. The defence of qualified privilege will be available even if the information is subsequently proved to be incorrect. Thus, the occasion will still be privileged even if the 'whistleblower' mistakenly but honestly publishes information which defames another person or the scientist or journalist honestly overlooks some fact which undermines the thesis of his or her claim. The publication of erroneous information may be evidence of malice in some cases. But by itself an error in the published information will not destroy the occasion of privilege.""


12This way of putting the matter does not depend upon reasonableness of the communication. McHugh J propounded a broad category of qualified privilege based on the honest dissemination to the general public of special knowledge concerning the exercise of public functions or powers or the performance by public representatives or officials of their duties.

13These views of McHugh J were a minority view. The majority (Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in a joint judgment, and Deane J in a separate judgment) expressed the matter differently.

14One of the expressed tasks of the Court in Lange was to reconsider previous statements of principle in order to (see 556):

""... settle both constitutional doctrine and the contemporary common law of Australia governing the defence of qualified privilege in actions of libel and slander.""

15After a discussion of the Constitutional principles at 557-568, the Court turned to defamation at 568-575. The Court recognised at 569-570 that the law of defamation, as it stood, imposed an undue burden on the required freedom of communication because:

""... the law as so understood arguably provides no appropriate defence for a person who mistakenly but honestly publishes government or political matter to a large audience. In Lang v Willis (1934) 52 CLR 637, this Court held that election speeches made to large audiences of unidentified persons are not necessarily privileged even if the speeches deal with matters of general interest to the electors. In that respect, the common law as hitherto understood in Australia has simply reflected the English common law.""

16The Court then, at 570, recognised the need for reciprocity of interest or duty as the essential element to qualified privilege. It continued, however (at 570):

""Only in exceptional cases has the common law recognised an interest or duty to publish defamatory matter to the general public. However, the common law doctrine as expounded in Australia must now be seen as imposing an unreasonable restraint on that freedom of communication, especially communication concerning government and political matters, which ""the common convenience and welfare of society"" now requires. Equally, the system of government prescribed by the Constitution would be impaired if a wider freedom for members of the public to give and to receive information concerning government and political matters were not recognised. The ""varying conditions of society"" of which Cockburn CJ spoke in Wason v Walter (1868) LR 4 QB 73 at 93 now evoke a broadening of the common law rules of qualified privilege."" (Citations omitted.)

17Immediately following this passage, the Court set out part of what McHugh J had said in Stephens, being the first of the two paragraphs set out above. This was not done as a statement of operative principle, but as an explanation of why it had come about that the varying conditions of society required a broadening of the common law rules of qualified privilege. The Court then went on to say (at 571):

""However, the common law of defamation can and ought to be developed to take into account the varied conditions to which McHugh J referred. The common law rules of qualified privilege will then properly reflect the requirements of ss 7, 24, 64, 128 and related sections of the Constitution.""

18The Court then formulated, at 571-575, an extended common law rule for qualified privilege by recognising, conformably with the Constitution, the interest in each member of the Australian community in disseminating and receiving information, opinions and arguments concerning government and political matters in Australia. The expression of the matter at 571-572 was as follows:

""Accordingly, this Court should now declare that each member of the Australian community has an interest in disseminating and receiving information, opinions and arguments concerning government and political matters that affect the people of Australia. The duty to disseminate such information is simply the correlative of the interest in receiving it. The common convenience and welfare of Australian society are advanced by discussion - the giving and receiving of information - about government and political matters. The interest that each member of the Australian community has in such a discussion extends the categories of qualified privilege. Consequently, those categories now must be recognised as protecting a communication made to the public on a government or political matter. It may be that, in some respects, the common law defence as so extended goes beyond what is required for the common law of defamation to be compatible with the freedom of communication required by the Constitution. For example, discussion of matters concerning the United Nations or other countries may be protected by the extended defence of qualified privilege, even if those discussions cannot illuminate the choice for electors at federal elections or in amending the Constitution or cannot throw light on the administration of federal government. 

Similarly, discussion of government or politics at State or Territory level and even at local government level is amenable to protection by the extended category of qualified privilege, whether or not it bears on matters at the federal level. Of course, the discussion of matters at State, Territory or local level might bear on the choice that the people have to make in federal elections or in voting to amend the Constitution, and on their evaluation of the performance of federal Ministers and their departments. The existence of national political parties operating at federal, State, Territory and local government levels, the financial dependence of State, Territory and local governments on federal funding and policies, and the increasing integration of social, economic and political matters in Australia make this conclusion inevitable. Thus, the extended category of common law qualified privilege ensures conformity with the requirements of the Constitution. The real question is as to the conditions upon which this extended category of common law qualified privilege should depend. 

At common law, once an occasion of qualified privilege is found to exist, the privilege traditionally protects a communication made on that occasion unless the plaintiff is actuated by malice in making the communication. But, apart from a few exceptional cases, the common law categories of qualified privilege protect only occasions where defamatory matter is published to a limited number of recipients."" (Citations omitted.)

19The conditions of exercise of the privilege were then fashioned. The expression of those conditions was preceded by further discussion of the common law of qualified privilege at 572, including discussion of the protection of qualified privilege only when publication is to a limited number of recipients. The Court said at 572:

""If a publication is made to a large audience, a claim of qualified privilege at common law is rejected unless, exceptionally, the members of the audience all have an interest in knowing the truth. Publication beyond what was reasonably sufficient for the occasion of qualified privilege is unprotected. Because privileged occasions are ordinarily occasions of limited publication - more often than not occasions of publication to a single person - the common law has seen honesty of purpose in the publisher as the appropriate protection for individual reputation. As long as the publisher honestly and without malice uses the occasion for the purpose for which it is given, that person escapes liability even though the publication is false and defamatory. But a test devised for situations where usually only one person receives the publication is unlikely to be appropriate when the publication is to tens of thousands, or more, of readers, listeners or viewers."" (Citations omitted.)

20The Court then stated that the criterion for application of the broader category of qualified privilege was to be reasonableness (573):

""... reasonableness of conduct seems the appropriate criterion to apply when the occasion of the publication of defamatory matter is said to be an occasion of qualified privilege solely by reason of the relevance of the matter published to the discussion of government or political matters. But reasonableness of conduct is imported as an element only when the extended category of qualified privilege is invoked to protect a publication that would otherwise be held to have been made to too wide an audience."" (Emphasis added.)

21This was not a rule laid down only for mass media (however one defines such an innominate class), though there was a recognition of the need to protect communications of a political kind to a wide audience. It was a fashioned extension to the common law of qualified privilege based on a Constitutionally founded interest in all in the community to disseminate and receive information, opinions and argument concerning government and politics as long as the conduct is reasonable.

22The extension of qualified privilege in Lange resulted in the existence of qualified privilege relating to political matters in two categories: first, the category concerning communications among or to electors in the course of an election, such as recognised in Braddock v Bevins [1948] 1 KB 580; and, secondly, the category in Lange.

23In Roberts v Bass [2002] HCA 57; 212 CLR 1, this distinction was noted: see Gleeson CJ at 9-10 in particular. However, in the light of how the case had been presented the Court did not attempt to reconcile or harmonise the two categories by any reformulation of the law. Nor did the Court recognise a third category concerning non-mass media political communication based on either the views of McHugh J in Stephens or of the Court in Lange shorn of the condition of exercise of reasonableness.

24The first category, the election cases, was referred to or discussed in Roberts v Bass: Gleeson CJ at 12-14 [11]-[14]; Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ at 29 [72]-[73], Kirby J at 61 [167] and Hayne J at [222]-[223]. It is founded on the honest statement of what is believed to be the truth, unqualified or conditioned by reasonableness, but as Gleeson CJ said in Bass at [14] ""in the course of an election contest."" See also Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ at [73] in the passages cited by Beazley JA. I agree with the expression of views of Beazley JA as to the substantive limits of the election cases.

25There is no basis to conclude from either Lange or Roberts v Bass that the election cases have established a category of qualified privilege otherwise not previously recognised based on the public interest in the dissemination of information or opinions about governmental or political matters shorn of any condition of exercise of reasonableness. I also agree with the views of Beazley JA in this regard. I also refer to and agree with the analysis of Nicholas J in The Korean Times Pty Ltd v Un Dok Pak [2011] NSWCA 365 at [90]-[101] and in Lloyd-Jones v Allen [2012] NSWCA 230 at [49]-[62].

26With the utmost respect to the primary judge, I cannot agree that any of these communications was made on occasions of qualified privilege. There was no election campaign under way, in any substantive sense. The election cases such as Braddock v Bevins do not avail the appellants. The Lange category and its condition of reasonableness was, understandably, eschewed by the appellants.

27The essential underpinning of legal reasoning of the primary judge that led her Honour to conclude that there were occasions of qualified privilege is to be found at [141]-[146] of her reasons. In those paragraphs, the primary judge, in substance, applied the second paragraph from the extract from the judgment of McHugh J in Stephens. That led her Honour to the conclusion that it mattered not that the statements were not made in the course of an election since they concerned the exercise of functions and powers by public representatives. The interest of electors in having information about their representatives was continuous and so the community of interest existed.

28That, with respect, is a significant departure from, or development of, Lange and Braddock v Bevins. It was made because of a perception that the statement of principle by McHugh J in Stephens as to the operative principle (as opposed to the articulation of why the common law should be developed) was approved by the High Court. It was not. To adopt this course is to fashion a category of qualified privilege based on the interest of all in the community in the manner expressed by the Court in Lange, without the condition of reasonableness. That development requires the rearticulation of Lange in the light of the election cases. That is a matter for the High Court. If I may say with respect to the views of Beazley JA in this regard, it may be that there are powerful considerations in favour of such a rearticulation and that suggest that McHugh J's views in Stephens have great force. That, however, is for the High Court. 

29Here anonymous pamphlets from a non-existent organisation were placed indiscriminately in the letterboxes of complete strangers, albeit in the local government area of Drummoyne. Thus, the recipients were strangers who lived or worked in Drummoyne. It can be accepted that many had the right (and duty) to vote in Council elections. There was no election called or in contemplation.

30The error in the primary judge's conclusions as to the existence of occasions of qualified privilege can be seen at [181]-[185] of her Honour's reasons. There it was said that if the content of the circulars related to the affairs and administration of the Council then each occasion would have been of qualified privilege. The necessary reciprocity in that subject matter was between Mr Marshall and Mr Tory (as the anonymous distributors) and anyone else in the Council area to whom the material was disseminated. At [189] the primary judge said:

""For the purpose of the first question, I will proceed upon the basis (as mentioned earlier in this judgment) that Mr Marshall was a Councillor on the Council; that Mr Tory had a relevant interest in Council matters; and that the circulars were distributed to recipients who were ratepayers and residents of the Drummoyne municipality, and had a legitimate interest in receiving information (and opinion or comment) on the functioning of the Council and its Councillors including its Mayor.""

31This approach goes beyond the existing categories of qualified privilege (that is the election cases and Lange). This approach posits information about the functioning of local government as a sufficient basis for reciprocity between, on the one hand, unidentified persons and, on the other, complete strangers whose only connection with the subject matter is that they live or work in the local government area, accepting that many will be electors in the area. To conclude that such is an occasion of qualified privilege is to fashion a broad category of qualified privilege based on shared presumed political interest, without the conditioning of reasonableness articulated in Lange. If it were correct, it would apply Australia-wide to dissemination of political views and opinions to all Australians about national politics without any condition of exercise of reasonableness.

32The primary judge expressed the view at [134] that Braddock v Bevins was not an authority limited to circumstances where there is an election. The words of the Court of Appeal were plainly in the context of an election. At 590, the Court referred to ""a good deal of authority for the view that qualified privilege extends to communications by one elector to another in relation to a candidate at an impending election."" The Court then said that it would be curious if the interest and duty between electors were to be seen as higher than between elector and candidate. The framework of analysis was expressly an impending election. The statement of principle at 592 (quoted by the primary judge at [76] of her reasons) was made in that express framework and should be understood as authority for that. This is how Gleeson CJ understood the matter in Roberts v Bass at 13 [14]. Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ at 29 [72] said that the assumption made by the parties that Braddock v Bevins gave effect to the common law of Australia was correctly made. Gleeson CJ had earlier (at 9 [4]) expressed the terms of the assumption of the parties: the category of common law privilege recognised in Braddock v Bevins ""[relates] to communications to thousands of electors in the course of an election"".

33In my view none of the communications was made on an occasion of qualified privilege.

A procedural question

34As Beazley JA puts it at [155] the argument about the politically founded category of qualified privilege was ""raised ... in an alarmingly non-specific way"". Her Honour has accepted that it was raised. For my part, that is a charitable view. This Court has said on a number of occasions that judges should be presented with issues with clarity: see by way of example, Nowlan v Marson Transport [2001] NSWCA 346; 53 NSWLR 116 at [28] - [29] approving White v Overland [2001] FCA 1333 at [4]. The Parliament has also said so, in effect, in the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), ss 56-60. Parties and counsel have a basal obligation to be clear about what issues are being raised for disposition. If issues are raised obliquely or hesitatingly and are not grasped by a trial judge, a party cannot complain in this Court. Efficient disposition of issues in litigation depends upon the clear identification of issues.

Damages

35I agree with the views of Beazley JA on damages. I would only add that I do not think that any award for Mr Megna could exceed the figure proposed by her Honour.

36BEAZLEY JA: 

Introduction 

The appeal proceedings

37This is an appeal from the decision of Simpson J in which her Honour entered verdicts in favour of each of the respondents, Mr Megna and Mr Lloyd, and awarded them damages for some but not all imputations contained in a series of circulars published by each of the appellants, Mr Marshall and Mr Tory. Her Honour awarded the first respondent, Mr Megna, damages in the sum of $395,000 and the second respondent, Mr Lloyd, damages in the sum of $220,000. 

38The appellants submitted that the circulars containing the imputations, on which the respondents succeeded, were each published on an occasion of qualified privilege contrary to the findings of her Honour and that her Honour further erred in finding that the communications were not relevant to the occasion. The appellants also appealed against the quantum of damages awarded and against her Honour's costs orders. 

39The respondents cross-appealed against her Honour's findings that other publications upon which they sued were published on an occasion of qualified privilege. The respondents also cross-appealed against her Honour's finding that the publications found to be published on an occasion of qualified privilege were not motivated by malice. The respondents also contended that the first matter complained of was not defeated by reason of the Limitation Act 1969, s 14.

40The trial judge also dismissed a cross-claim, brought by Mr Marshall against Mr Megna, in which he alleged he had been defamed by two articles in a publication entitled Veritas published by Mr Megna. In his defence to the cross-claim, Mr Megna pleaded that the imputations were made on an occasion of qualified privilege and were also protected by the defence of comment pursuant to the Defamation Act 1974, ss 30-32. Her Honour found that each publication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege and that the second publication was protected by the defence of comment.

41Mr Marshall has appealed against the dismissal of the cross-claim on the ground that her Honour either failed to consider or erred in her findings both on qualified privilege and comment. 

42It will be convenient at this point to identify the imputations subject of the appeal and the cross-appeal. 

43The imputations the subject of the appeal were: 6(a), 8(b), 8(c), 12(a), 12(b), 12(c), 12(d), 14(a), 14(b), 14(c), 14(d), 14(e), 18(a), 24(a), 24(c), 24(d), 24(e), 24(f), 26(a), 26(b), 26(c), 26(d), 26(f), 26(g), 28(b), 28(c), 28(d), 30(a), 32(e) and 32(f).

44The imputations subject of the cross-appeal, being those in respect of which her Honour held were published on an occasion of qualified privilege were: 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(d), 2(e), 4(a), 4(b), 4(c), 6(c), 6(d), 6(e), 8(a), 10(a), 10(b), 10(c), 10(d), 10(e), 10(f), 10(g), 16(a), 16(b), 18(b), 18(c), 18(d), 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), 22(a), 22(b), 22(c), 22(d), 22(e), 22(f), 22(g), 28(a), 28(e), 28(f), 28(g), 30(b), 30(c), 30(d). 30(e), 32(a), 32(b), 32(c), 32(d), 34(a), 34(b), 34(c), 34(d), 34(e), 34(f), 34(g) and 34(h).

Procedural issues

Further amended notice of appeal

45At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal, Mr Marshall sought leave to further amend his amended notice of appeal by amending ground 4, adding a new ground 6 and amending ground 7 (which had been numbered 6 in the amended notice of appeal). The respondents objected to leave being granted in respect of grounds 4 and 6. They raised no objection to the amendment to the renumbered ground 7. 

46The Court refused leave in respect of the proposed amendments relating to grounds 4 and 6 at the time that the application was made, but reserved its reasons until the final judgment in the matter. The reasons below are the Court's reasons for its decision to refuse leave to amend those grounds. 

47The amendments sought to be made were as follows (the underlined portion of ground 4 being the proposed amendment to that ground). The new ground 6 is also underlined, so as to accord with the format of the proposed further amended cross-claim:

""4: The Court erred in failing to consider whether the imputations conveyed by the matter complained of in the first cross claim was conveyed as fact or comment. The Court should have held that the imputations were not conveyed as fact nor comment, and the first cross respondent knew that the subject matters were neither fact nor comment to either part of the first cross claim.

...

6. Conduct of respondents and their Legal Representatives when appearing before Justice Studdert 7A hearing and before Justice Simpson in the Trial in that in both instances evidence was tendered which was obtained by improper and illegal means and put to both Judges as if it had been legally and properly obtained and in doing so the barristers for both respondents lied continuously to each Judge when they were fully aware of the impropriety of the evidence being presented, and relied upon, by the respondents."" 

48The proposed amendment to ground 4 was intended to be supported by an affidavit of Mr Marshall of 12 pages with nearly 190 pages of annexures. It appears that some at least of this material is new material that was not in evidence in either part of the proceedings at first instance.

49The respondents objected to ground 4 on the basis it made no juridical sense. The proposed amendment pleaded that the imputations were neither fact nor comment. On that basis, there was ""no terrain left"". An imputation could be pleaded as either fact or comment. As the respondents pointed out, this proposed pleading, in effect, confused the issues of comment and qualified privilege. 

50Mr Marshall submitted that there was confusion in the submissions as to whether what was pleaded in the cross-claim was comment or fact. He contended, however, that it was in fact ""fiction"" and informed the Court that he had provided all the details of how Mr Megna had knowingly written ""a whole load of lies"".

51The respondents' submission in respect of ground 4 is correct and, for that reason alone, leave should be refused to amend ground 4. The proposed introduction of new evidence is a further reason to reject this amendment.

52The proposed new ground 6 was intended to be supported by an affidavit of Mr Marshall of 62 pages with another 330 pages of annexures.

53The respondents submitted that the issue raised by the proposed new ground 6 had not been raised at trial so that it was contrary to both principal and justice for the matter to be raised on appeal for the first time: see Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33; 162 CLR 1. Further, Mr Marshall had not raised this issue in his appeal against the jury verdict in the s 7A trial: see Tory v Megna [2007] NSWCA 13, notwithstanding that part of the complaint raised in proposed new ground 6 relates to the conduct of the s 7A trial.

54Mr Marshall responded that he had attempted ""in broad detail ... to uncover the facts of what took place"". He also said that ""all of these facts were not available"" to him at the time of the s 7A trial because of the ""craft"" with which counsel for the opposing parties had conducted that hearing.

55Again, the respondents' submission must be accepted. Not only was the issue proposed to be raised in this new ground not raised in the trial below, it was totally unrelated to the issues on the appeal. For both reasons, this ground was rejected.

56A complication arose in the course of the hearing of the appeal. The appellants contended that the extended defence of qualified privilege, articulated in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25; 189 CLR 520, applied to all publications on government and political matters but the requirement that the publisher's conduct be reasonable only applied to cases of publication by the mass media. The complication that this argument raised was twofold. First, there was a question as to whether the argument had been advanced at first instance. The second was whether the argument raised a constitutional issue. 

57Although these issues arose on the cross-appeal, it is convenient to deal with them at the outset because they throw up for consideration the basis upon which the trial judge determined that the defence of qualified privilege applied. It also gives rise to another complication. If the appellants do not succeed in defending their success on qualified privilege on the imputations subject of the cross-appeal, they ought not to succeed on their argument on qualified privilege on the appeal. The respondents did not file a notice of contention in respect of her Honour's findings of qualified privilege in relation to the imputations that are the subject of the appeal. However, given that the arguments of both the appellants and the respondents on the question of qualified privilege were overarching, it is appropriate to overlook that irregularity, being only one of many of which all parties were guilty in this matter. 

58During the course of the opening address to the trial judge, senior counsel for the respondents informed her Honour that the appellants, in an interlocutory hearing, had informed the Court that they relied upon the common law defence of qualified privilege that did not include any aspect of reasonableness. Senior counsel continued, ""It is common law qualified privilege other than as contained in Lange"". Senior counsel for the appellants responded to this as follows: 

""That's basically right. My friend, I think, puts it necessarily in a summary way and, therefore, perhaps an overly simplistic way.

What is said by the High Court in Lange is still relevant to the question of the availability of common law qualified privilege as a defence, but not as extended in Lange so as to include a requirement of reasonableness. There's a case referred to in Roberts v Bass in the High Court called Braddock v Bevins, which is the common law qualified privilege defence - and which you Honour is no doubt familiar with. My friend is right to the extent that he says I'm not proposing to adduce any evidence of reasonableness because it forms some elements of the defence that is raised by paragraph 39."" 

59The trial judge, at [21], understood from this exchange that the appellants' sole defence was that of qualified privilege at common law, including as articulated in Braddock v Bevins [1948] 1 KB 580, adopted by the High Court in Roberts v Bass [2002] HCA 57; 212 CLR 1 and applied by this Court in Bennette v Cohen [2009] NSWCA 60 and Fraser v Holmes [2009] NSWCA 36. Her Honour, at [2], added: 

""A related defence, concerning the publication of defamatory material on political issues (see Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25; (1997) 189 CLR 520) has not been invoked and expressly disclaimed. The substantial difference between what are, in effect, two strands of the same defence, is that the defence as explained in Lange requires proof, by the defendant, of reasonableness of conduct. Given that the Lange defence is not invoked, it is not necessary, in this case, for either defendant to establish that his conduct was reasonable.""

60The appellants submitted that they had argued a wider case than identified by the respondents in the extract above at [58], and as had been stated by her Honour at [21] of the primary judgment. The respondents accepted this may have been so, although the precise parameters of the argument before the trial judge remained obscure. The appellants nonetheless identified two arguments they said were properly before the Court. First, whether there was an occasion of qualified privilege that did not require reasonableness. Secondly, whether the principle laid down in the 'election cases' extends beyond the period in which an election is being conducted. I am satisfied that the second of these arguments was advanced in the Court below and it appears from [21] of the primary judgment, that some version of the first was also argued. 

61The appellants also submitted that if the cases relating to political comment in respect of elections was confined to the election period, the law required development so as to be compatible with the constitutional freedom of political communication recognised in Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Ltd [1994] HCA 46; 182 CLR 104 and further articulated in Lange. This led to the Court requiring notices to be given to the Attorneys General of the States and Territories pursuant to the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), s 78B. None of the Attorneys General sought to intervene in the proceedings in this Court. The extent to which the Court needs to deal with the questions raised in the s 78B notices will be considered later in these reasons. 

Brief background of facts and history of the proceedings

62Mr Megna was the Mayor of Drummoyne Local Council (the Council). Mr Lloyd was the General Manager. Mr Marshall was a resident and a one-time councillor on the Council. Mr Tory was a resident.

63From about 1998 onwards, a circular was distributed in the Drummoyne municipality, purportedly under the auspices of the Drummoyne Council Ratepayers Association. There was no such organisation. Over a period of five and a half years from 1998 to 2003, approximately 28 circulars were distributed in the Drummoyne municipality. The circulars dealt with matters relating to local government issues in the Drummoyne municipality. Mr Megna and Mr Lloyd brought proceedings against Mr Marshall and Mr Tory alleging that these publications contained defamatory imputations of them.

64Although there was no evidence of the actual extent of the distribution of the circulars, the evidence disclosed that there were about 12,000 rateable properties in the Drummoyne municipality and about 30,000 residents. Subsequently, with the merger of Drummoyne Council with Concord Council to form the City of Canada Bay Council in 2000, an additional 10,000 rateable properties were added to the local government area, increasing the population by approximately 25,000 persons. 

65There was some evidence of publication outside the Drummoyne municipality, admitted over objection. However, the respondents confined their argument on the appeal to publication within the Drummoyne municipality, but submitted that the recipients of the circulars were not necessarily residents or ratepayers. This argument was directed to denying a reciprocity of duty and interest which was at the heart of their argument on qualified privilege. The evidence disclosed that 20 per cent of ratepayers in the Drummoyne municipality were businesses. Whilst there were no figures of the percentage of persons employed in businesses who were also residents, the evidence disclosed that approximately half the employees of the Council itself were not residents. The respondents submitted that it could be inferred that that figure would be replicated in other businesses in the area. The respondents submitted that residents and persons engaged in businesses in the Drummoyne municipality, including employees, who were not ratepayers, had no necessary interest in the affairs of the Council or the conduct of the Mayor and the General Manager in respect of Council affairs. 

66The appellants did not accept that the extent of the publication was to all ratepaying properties in the local government areas and contended that the evidence of publication was somewhat limited. They pointed to Mr Megna's evidence that he received from or was shown copies of the circular by his mother-in-law, who was a local resident, and from members of Council staff who lived within the municipality and that he was told about the circulars by residents in Concord. However, in evidence to which the appellants did not refer, Mr Megna also said that he had seen Mr Marshall distribute the letters in a number of streets in the municipality and that on those occasions he had seen Mr Marshall place a circular in each letterbox in the street. There was also evidence from Mr Lloyd, who did not live in the municipality, that he was shown copies of the circulars when employees of the Council brought them into work. 

67Mr Megna pleaded that he had been defamed in 17 circulars conveying 60 imputations. Mr Lloyd pleaded he had been defamed in 15 circulars conveying 35 imputations. 

68In a trial before a jury conducted pursuant to the Defamation Act, s 7A, the jury found that the matters complained of contained 54 defamatory imputations of Mr Megna and 35 of Mr Lloyd. The imputations defamatory of Mr Megna included that he was incompetent as Mayor, was a sneak and, as Mayor of the Drummoyne municipality, manipulated the Council's agenda to prevent residents being able to address the Council about the performance of the General Manager. The principal defamatory imputation of Mr Lloyd was that he was incompetent as a General Manager. As is apparent from the period over which the defamatory conduct occurred and the number of publications involved, the campaign was prolonged and, on the finding of the trial judge, particularly vitriolic. 

69The jury made no finding as to the authorship of the circulars. Rather, the relevant guilty publication found against both Mr Marshall and Mr Tory was that they distributed the circulars. There was some evidence before the jury that Mr Marshall also had some involvement in printing the circulars. However, her Honour observed, at [7], that it is not known what the jury made of that evidence. 

70Following the jury's verdict and in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Defamation Act, defences were filed by Mr Marshall and Mr Tory in which they pleaded the defamatory publications were made on occasions of qualified privilege. Mr Marshall and Mr Tory pleaded a limitation defence in respect of the defamatory imputations contained in the first circular: see the Limitation Act, s 14. Mr Marshall also pleaded fair comment. In response to the qualified privilege defence, Mr Megna and Mr Lloyd denied that the publications were made on occasions of qualified privilege and pleaded that they were motivated by malice. 

71The trial judge rejected the qualified privilege defence in respect of the imputations identified at [43] above as the imputations on the appeal. Her Honour upheld the defence of qualified privilege in respect of the imputations identified at [44] above as the imputations on the cross-appeal. Her Honour also rejected that the appellants were motivated by malice. Her Honour held that the first matter complained of was statute-barred. The result of her Honour's determination was that Mr Megna was successful in respect of 26 imputations in 10 circulars and Mr Lloyd was successful in respect of 7 imputations in 5 circulars. 

72On Mr Marshall's cross-claim the trial judge upheld the defences of qualified privilege and fair comment. 

73Although the above sufficiently states the outcome of the hearing, it is useful at this point to set out the issues identified by the trial judge as arising for determination and her conclusion in respect of each issue. The issues were as follows: 

(1) Whether the publications were made on an occasion of qualified privilege. Her Honour considered there were three strands to that inquiry: reciprocity of duty and interest, relevance to the occasion and malice: see at [50] and [175]. 

(2) The meaning of 'communication' for the purposes of the defence of qualified privilege. Her Honour held that a communication had to have content, that is, it had to convey information or state an opinion: see at [59] and [118]. 

(3) The relationship between the question of relevance to the privileged occasion and malice: see at [51]. Her Honour accepted, at [86], that the assessment of relevance to the occasion and questions of malice could share an evidentiary foundation.

(4) Whether an occasion of qualified privilege may be defeated by excessive language. Her Honour concluded that the tone of a publication did not disqualify the occasion as one of qualified privilege: see at [129].

(5) Whether the principle stated in the 'election cases' was confined to the period of an election campaign. Her Honour concluded that the 'election cases' were not so confined: see at [134]-[146].

(6) Whether the defence of qualified privilege was available where there was widespread distribution. Her Honour accepted that there was in fact widespread distribution in this case but that such distribution did not defeat the defence in the circumstances where those who lived and worked in the municipality had an interest in the affairs of the Council: see at [147]-[152]. 

(7) Whether the fact that the publications were volunteered denied the occasion of privilege. Her Honour held that it was not the law that there had to be a 'pressing need' for a volunteered statement for the defence of qualified privilege to be available: see at [159]-[162]. This view of the legal position in respect of volunteered statements has subsequently been held by the High Court to be correct: see Papaconstuntinos v Holmes à Court [2012] HCA 53; 293 ALR 215. 

(8) Whether the defence of qualified privilege was available in a case where the authorship was anonymous. Her Honour rejected that the defence was unavailable in such circumstances: see at [167]-[171]. 

(9) Whether the abusive tone of the publications established malice. Her Honour held that the tone of the publications did not establish malice and that malice had not otherwise been made out: see at [598]-[602]; [611].

Issues on the appeal and cross-appeal

74The following issues arose for determination on the appeal and the cross-appeal:

(1) Whether the imputations on the appeal were published on an occasion of qualified privilege;

(2) If so, whether the imputations on the appeal were relevant to the occasion of qualified privilege;

(3) Whether her Honour erred in finding that the imputations on the cross-appeal were published on an occasion of qualified privilege;

(4) Whether the appellants were motivated by malice;

(5) Whether the defences of qualified privilege and fair comment were made out in respect of the imputations alleged in the cross-claim;

(6) Whether her Honour erred in holding that the claim based on the first circular was statute-barred;

(7) Whether the damages awarded were excessive;

(8) Whether her Honour erred in ordering that the appellants pay the whole of the respondents' costs.

Qualified privilege

Principles governing common law qualified privilege

75Before considering the principles that govern the defence of common law qualified privilege, a reference to the position taken by the appellants and respondents respectively is helpful so as to understand the basis upon which each sought to analyse the authorities. The appellants contended that her Honour had correctly recognised that there was no distinction, for the purposes of the defence of qualified privilege, between an 'election case' and a 'political discussion' case. Their ultimate argument was that there was a species of qualified privilege for political comment outside what was described as 'the election period' that was not qualified by the requirement of reasonableness. The respondents submitted that there was no such category and that her Honour had erred in finding that 'public interest' in a topic was sufficient to found an occasion of qualified privilege. 

76A person who publishes defamatory matter is protected from liability if the publication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege: see the Defamation Act, s 22 (which preserved the common law defence of qualified privilege). Legal discourse concerning the defence of qualified privilege usually commences with the following statement of Parke B in Toogood v Spyring (1834) 1 Cr M & R 181:

""If fairly warranted by any reasonable occasion or exigency, and honestly made, such communications are protected for the common convenience and welfare of society; and the law has not restricted the right to make them within any narrow limits.""

This statement, albeit well entrenched in the jurisprudence of the law of qualified privilege, is properly to be understood as a statement of the policy behind qualified privilege and not as a complete statement of the law on the subject: Papaconstuntinos v Holmes a Court at [28]-[29]. 

77An observation to like effect is to be found in the reasons of the plurality in Cush v Dillon [2011] HCA 30; 243 CLR 298 at [12], where their Honours said: 

""The defence of qualified privilege is based upon notions of public policy, that freedom of communication may in some circumstances assume more importance than an individual's right to the protection of his or her reputation. The question of whether the person making a defamatory statement was subject to some duty or was acting in the protection of some interest, in making the statement, is to be understood in this light.""

78In Aktas v Westpac Banking Corporation Limited [2010] HCA 25; 241 CLR 79, the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ) noted, at [22], that: 

""In Justin v Associated Newspapers Ltd, Walsh JA said that the 'broad principle' underlying qualified privilege is that occasions exist in which it is desirable as a matter of public policy that freedom of communication should be given priority over the right of the individual to protection against loss of reputation. It also has been said that the categories (if there be utility in a system of categories) of occasions of qualified privilege are not closed and cannot be rendered exact. Cases of reciprocity, or as Griffith CJ put it, 'community of interest', supply a recognised category, which in turn has an indeterminate reference. The limits of that range of reference in a given case are to be placed by regard to the 'broad principle' identified by Walsh JA and to the remarks of Dixon J in Guise v Kouvelis as follows:

'But the very width of the principles governing qualified privilege for defamation makes it more necessary, in deciding how they apply, to make a close scrutiny of the circumstances of the case, of the situation of the parties, of the relations of all concerned and of the events leading up to and surrounding the publication.'"" (citations omitted)

79Kiefel J, after referring, at [89], to the ""public interest in maintaining freedom of communications which are necessary to everyday life"" and noting that the law regarded it as ""preferable 'that individuals should occasionally suffer than that freedom of communication between persons in certain relations should be in any way impeded'"", stated, at [95]-[96]:

""For the defence of qualified privilege to apply there must, in the circumstances surrounding the publication of the defamatory matter, be an 'occasion' for the communication in question, as the passage from Toogood v Spyring cited above requires. In addition, the communication must be necessary to that occasion ('fairly warranted') and made with honest purpose.

In determining whether there was an occasion for the making of the statement communicated, attention is principally directed to the interest the defendant had in making it. Earlier in his judgment Parke B referred to such an occasion arising where the statement is:

'fairly made by a person in the discharge of some public or private duty, whether legal or moral, or in the conduct of his own affairs, in matters where his interest is concerned.'

In such cases, he explained, the occasion allows for the qualified defence."" (citations omitted)

80Reference should also be made to the recent High Court decision Harbour Radio Pty Ltd v Trad [2012] HCA 44; 86 ALJR 1256. The issue in that case was the nature of the reciprocity of interest where there has been a public reply to public criticism. Nonetheless, the observation of the plurality (Gummow, Hayne and Bell JJ), at [20], is relevant to the circumstances of the present case, which involved publication to a large number of people:

""... it is only in exceptional cases that the common law has recognised an interest or duty to publish defamatory matter to the general public"": see Lange at 570.

81Their Honours made the further comment, at [27], that whilst the use of vigorous language was a characteristic of public debate in Australia, ""in the conduct of public affairs the law, in general, does not encourage persuasion by public vilification and by an abdication of reason"". 

82In Lange, the Court observed, at 570, that the basis of the common law rule was that reciprocity of interest or duty was essential to a claim of qualified privilege at common law. For that reason it was only in exceptional cases that a publication of defamatory matter to the general public attracted the privilege. The Court explained why this was so, at 572:

""[A]part from a few exceptional cases, the common law categories of qualified privilege protect only occasions where defamatory matter is published to a limited number of recipients. If a publication is made to a large audience, a claim of qualified privilege at common law is rejected unless, exceptionally, the members of the audience all have an interest in knowing the truth.""

83It will be necessary to return to Lange later in these reasons. 

84The trial judge's decision in this case predated the High Court's decisions in Atkas, Cush v Dillon, Papaconstuntinos and Harbour Radio v Trad. It was not suggested that these decisions changed or modified the principles relating to qualified privilege at common law, which have been well worked out in the case law. For that reason, I consider it sufficient to refer only to a small number of cases where the principle has been discussed. 

85It is convenient to commence with Andreyevich v Kosovich (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 357 and Bashford v Information Australia (Newsletters) Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 5; 218 CLR 366. 

86In Andreyevich v Kosovich, Jordan CJ stated, at 363:

""To succeed [in their defence of qualified privilege], it was necessary that [the defendants] should show by evidence that both the givers and the receivers of the defamatory information had a special and reciprocal interest in its subject matter, of such a kind that it was desirable as a matter of public policy, in the general interests of the whole community of New South Wales, that it should be made with impunity, notwithstanding that it was defamatory of a third party.""

87This statement was directly adopted by McHugh J in Bashford, at [55], where his Honour stated:

""It is of the first importance to understand that references to concepts such as 'the common convenience and welfare of society' and similar phrases record a result and explain why the communication and the relevant duty or interest gave rise to an occasion of qualified privilege. Such concepts are not the determinants of whether the occasion is privileged. They must be distinguished from the question whether society would recognise a duty or interest in the publisher making, and the recipient receiving, the communication in question.""

88His Honour then quoted the passage from Andreyevich v Kosovich to which I have just referred and continued, at [55]:

""It is only when the defendant has a duty to publish or an interest in publishing the particular communication and the recipient has a corresponding duty or interest that the occasion is privileged. It is only when this reciprocity of duty and interest is present that the common law regards publication of the communication as being for the common convenience and welfare of society.""

89Although his Honour was in dissent and his statement relating to volunteered statements was rejected in Papaconstuntinos v Holmes à Court, the observations just quoted are accepted statements of general principle. See also Gummow J in Bashford at [140], who also adopted the above passage from the judgment of Jordan CJ in Andreyevich v Kosovich.

90In Moit v Bristow [2005] NSWCA 322, McColl JA (Beazley JA and Campbell AJA (as his Honour then was) agreeing) stated, at [78]-[79]: 

""In order to determine whether a publication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege, the court examines all the circumstances of the case. These include the nature of the defamatory communication, the status or position of the publisher, the number of recipients and the nature of any interest they had in receiving it, and the time, place and manner of, and reason for, the publication. After considering these matters, the court makes a judgment as to whether the publisher had a duty or interest that justified making the publication and whether the recipients, or some of them, had a duty to receive or interest in receiving it: Bashford per McHugh J at [54]; see also Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ at [10]; Gummow J at [139]; Callinan J at [235]. 

In order to establish a publication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege, the publisher must call evidence which establishes 'that both the givers and the receivers of the defamatory information had a special and reciprocal interest in its subject matter, of such a kind that it was desirable as a matter of public policy, in the general interests of the whole community of New South Wales, that it should be made with impunity, notwithstanding that it was defamatory of a third party': Andreyevich v Kosovich (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 357 at 363 per Jordan CJ; applied in Bashford by McHugh J at [55]; by Gummow J at [140].""

91In Bennette v Cohen, at [25], Ipp JA set out a number of propositions that his Honour considered were to be derived from the authorities relating to qualified privilege, not including the extended form of privilege referred to in Lange: 

""(a) The test for common law qualified privilege is usually expressed at a very high level of generality and abstraction;
(b) In practice, however, the close scrutiny required of all the circumstances of each case results in common law qualified privilege having a relatively limited or narrow practical application;
(c) The scrutiny required depends on the facts of each case and there is no closed set of criteria that must be applied or considered, and;
(d) Guidelines have been established that assist in the scrutiny that is required. These include:

(i) As a matter of public policy, it must be in the general interest of the whole community that the type of material in question be published, notwithstanding that it is defamatory of a third party;
(ii) The occasion must not be used for some purpose or motive foreign to the interest that protects the making of the statement. Further, there must be a significant connection between the defamatory material and the privileged occasion;
(iii) The interest that gives rise to qualified privilege must be real and direct;
(iv) ... 
(v) If a publication is made to a large audience, a claim of qualified privilege at common law will fail unless the members of the audience all have an interest in knowing the truth, and;
(vi) The interest should not give officious and interfering persons a wide licence to defame.""

92Campbell JA, at [206], expressed agreement with these propositions. His Honour also commented upon the relationship between public interest and qualified privilege. Campbell JA, at [207], stated:

""It seems uncontroversial that the notion of the public interest operates as a means of limiting the sorts of reciprocal duty or interest that can give rise to qualified privilege. However one does not enquire whether the particular statement that was defamatory was made in circumstances such that the reciprocal interest of the maker and recipient of the statement was such that the making of that statement itself advanced the welfare of society and the public interest. Rather, the requirement of public interest, for the existence of qualified privilege operates at a higher level of generality, that the duty or interest of both maker and recipient is such that it is in the public interest that a person should be free to make that type of statement in the type of circumstances where the particular statement in question was made."" (original emphasis)

93His Honour added, at [209], that the case law bore out that it was:

""... by reference to the type of communication involved in the defamatory utterance, rather than the particular defamatory utterance itself, that the public interest is to be gauged"": see Toogood v Spyring

94After the trial judge's review of the authorities, her Honour stated, at [175], that the proper questions to ask, in determining whether the defence of qualified privilege had been made out, were as follows:

""● were the circumstances (Moit, Baird) in which the communication was published (including, importantly, the subject matter of the communication and the identity of the publisher and the recipients) such as to give rise to the requisite duty or interest in the publisher, and the reciprocal interest in the recipient in receiving the publication, thus creating an occasion of qualified privilege?

● if the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, was the particular statement of which complaint is made sufficiently relevant (Adam v Ward, Braddock v Bevins, Mowlds v Fergusson, Bellino; contra Horrocks v Lowe) germane (Adam v Ward) or did it have sufficient connection (Bashford) to that occasion?

(if the answer to either of the preceding questions is in the negative, then there is no call to proceed further. There is no defence of qualified privilege.)

● if the answer to both preceding questions is in the affirmative, was the publisher actuated by express malice?""

(Her Honour had earlier, at [50], identified the same tripartite enquiry.)

95Before turning to the issues on the appeal two further matters should be noted. First, a question that concerned her Honour was the intemperate language used and whether that was sufficient to deny what otherwise might have been an occasion of qualified privilege: see judgment at [53]. In this regard, at [58], her Honour referred to the following passage in Gatley on Libel and Slander, 11th ed (2008), para 14.4, quoting Huntley v Ward (1859) 6 CB (NS) 514 at 517: 

""In such cases, no matter how harsh, hasty, untrue or libellous the publication would be, but for the circumstances, the law declares it privileged because the amount of public inconvenience from the restriction of freedom of speech or writing would far outbalance that arising from the infliction of a private injury."" (italics added)

96The second matter related to what are referred to as the 'election cases'. In this regard, the respondents accepted that there was a defence of qualified privilege at common law that applied to some aspects of publication about candidates in elections. This was recognised in Braddock v Bevins, where the Court stated, at 590:

""... there is a good deal of authority for the view that qualified privilege extends to communications by one elector to another in relation to a candidate at an impending election.""

The Court further observed, at 590-591, that there was no distinction between the interest and duty existing between electors and the interest and duty existing between an elector and a candidate. 

97The principle stated in Braddock v Bevins was accepted in Roberts v Bass as good law in Australia. 

Trial judge's reasons

98In answering the first of the questions posed (see at [94] above), her Honour held that the imputations subject of the cross-appeal were published on occasions of qualified privilege. 

99The respondents' essential complaint was that her Honour applied a wrong test of public or legitimate interest in determining that question rather than determining whether there was a reciprocal duty and interest in the communication and receipt of the information. 

100The appellants submitted that a communication on a political or government matter was an occasion of qualified privilege in respect of which there was no requirement of reasonableness as there was in the case of mass media publications. 

101As is apparent, the arguments advanced by the parties were in separate universes of legal discourse. 

102Her Honour, as I understand it, found the relevant publications were made on occasions of common law qualified privilege, analogous to the 'election cases'. However, so as to ensure her Honour's reasoning is correctly understood, it is appropriate to set out the particular sections of her judgment where she makes express reference to this question.

103The first relevant section is found at [279]-[291], where her Honour was dealing with the fourth matter complained of which appeared in a circular dated August 1998 and was headed ""POLITICAL BULL"". At the time, Mr Megna was seeking pre-selection by the Liberal Party as a candidate in the State election. Her Honour explained, at [283], that the tenor of the circular was to question Mr Megna's motives about the construction of a pedestrian crossing in his electorate at a time when he was considering pre-selection for a state Liberal Party seat in an upcoming election. Her Honour considered that the clear suggestion in the article was that Mr Megna lacked bona fides and that his clear motivation in making the announcement was to further his own political ambitions.

104After recording the imputation conveyed by the article, namely:

""8(a): that as Mayor of the Council Mr Megna provided information which he knew to be false for an article in a local newspaper""

her Honour stated:

""285 Despite the DCRA heading, and the usual slogan, this item could in no way be perceived as directed to the affairs or performance of the Council. It was a direct attack upon Mr Megna in the context of his political ambitions. References to him as Mayor were incidental to that. That does not mean that it is not a subject matter that gives rise to an occasion of qualified privilege. Indeed, the conduct and record of candidates for political office is precisely the kind of subject matter that has repeatedly been held to give rise to such an occasion (Braddock v Bevins, Roberts v Bass, Fraser v Holmes). 

286 There is, I accept, something incongruous about a finding that, in a circular proclaiming itself to be concerned with affairs of local government, an occasion of qualified privilege exists to protect a discussion of the merits of a candidate for State political office. But there are two answers to that: as I have said above, the title and slogan of the circulars is not determinative of the existence of such an occasion; and, in my view, the evidence shows that there existed considerable overlap between the relevant State electorate and the Drummoyne municipality. Accordingly, residents and ratepayers of the Drummoyne municipality had an interest in receiving information about any such candidate. As I have said above, the occasion of qualified privilege has to be determined by reference to the content of the individual item. Here, the context is concerned with the suitability of Mr Megna as a potential elected representative in State Parliament. That classically creates an occasion of qualified privilege. 

287 I am satisfied that this was an issue on which Mr Marshall and Mr Tory had an interest in communicating information. 

288 The question of reciprocity, however, needs further consideration. The evidence did not disclose directly the electorate in which Mr Megna's ambitions lay. However, it was implicit in the cross-examination, and from all of the material, including Mr Megna's history, and I am prepared to infer that it was an electorate that, at least, overlapped significantly, with the Drummoyne municipality. Accordingly, residents and ratepayers of the Council had the requisite interest in receiving information concerning Mr Megna's integrity and suitability as a candidate. 

289 The occasion of qualified privilege is thus established.""

105The second portion of her Honour's judgment to which the respondent referred was the seventeenth matter complained of, being a publication in August/September 2003 entitled ""Michael Megna - You asked for it!"". The item referred to an article in a local newspaper to which the authors of the circular stated they were responding. The item characterised conduct of Mr Megna as involving ""deception, self interest, political corruptness, manipulation, lie after lie, payback, cheating and straight out public dishonesty"". There were then a number of pages of specific allegations. The relevant election was not due until 2004. It was in that context her Honour made the following findings:

""[595] Unusually, the factual context in which this circular was published is relatively simple and uncontroversial. Mr Megna had declared an intention to contest local government elections scheduled to be held in 2004. The introduction (whether factually accurate or inaccurate) was directed entirely to his candidature, and his suitability for election by residents and ratepayers of the municipality. 

[596] This is a classic occasion of qualified privilege. There is nothing in the introduction (from which all imputations are derived) that is irrelevant to that. 

[597] Accordingly, subject to the question of malice, these imputations were published under qualified privilege."" (emphasis added)

The respondents' argument

106The respondents accepted, as did the appellants, that her Honour's review of the law relating to the defence of qualified privilege at common law was substantially correct. The respondents submitted that her Honour appeared to accept that, provided the subject matter of the matters complained of was of legitimate interest to the residents and ratepayers of the municipality, the publications were protected by common law qualified privilege. They submitted that the error in this approach was that her Honour elided the difference between public interest and the special and reciprocal interest, which must be established if a defamatory utterance is protected by the defence of qualified privilege: see Andreyevich v Kosovich. The respondents also contended that her Honour erred in finding that the principles discussed in the 'election cases': see Braddock v Bevins, applied outside the 'election period'.

107The respondents emphasised the need to look at all the circumstances in determining whether the publication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege. They contended that the privilege was not attracted in this case having regard to the following circumstances: the fact that the circulars were distributed to every letterbox in the municipality; the anonymity of the editors and publishers of the circulars; and that the circulars were published under the auspices of a non-existent, fictitious organisation, with the attendant deceitfulness that that involved. 

108The fact that the editors and publishers of the circulars were anonymous and that the circulars were published under the auspices of a non-existent, fictitious organisation was of some importance to the respondents' argument that the matters complained of were not published on an occasion of qualified privilege. The respondents submitted that the appellants, whom they contended were the authors or involved in the authorship of the circulars, engaged in an apparent arms' length analysis of Council matters when, in fact, they were posturing behind the existence of a fictitious, non-existent organisation. 

109This factor was said to have an even more sinister aspect, in that, in posing as an organisation of concerned citizens commenting on Council matters of importance to residents and businesses in the municipality, the circulars were setting up a smokescreen as to the real intent in the publication, namely, the disparagement of the Mayor and the General Manager in strident and vituperative terms. The respondents submitted that the deceitfulness of the publications was exemplified by the praise given in them to Mr Marshall in particular, in contrast to the treatment of Mr Megna, especially at election time, in circumstances when Mr Marshall had an unrevealed connection with the publications, namely, that Mr Marshall distributed the circulars. 

110The respondents submitted that the trial judge erred in that her Honour did not consider all the circumstances and therefore did not consider the question of special and reciprocal interest. Rather, they submitted that her Honour determined the question of qualified privilege only on the basis of there being a public interest in particular information. The respondents submitted that the authorities are clear that public interest, of itself, is not sufficient to establish the defence of qualified privilege. The respondents focused on a number of passages in her Honour's judgment, which they contended were illustrative of the error. These are discussed below. 

111The respondents further contended that, as a general rule, an unrestricted publication does not attract the defence of qualified privilege: see Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1977] 2 NSWLR 749 and Lange. In advancing this argument, the respondents acknowledged that publication to a wide audience may attract the privilege, as occurred in Bashford. However, in that case, a special and reciprocal interest was found in circumstances where the recipients of the information were subscribers to a specialist publication on occupational health and safety in which the defamatory imputations were published. The respondents submitted that the publications in this case were not of that kind. Although the circulars were directed to ratepayers in the municipality, the mode of circulation was by way of a letterbox drop to houses and businesses in the area. It could be assumed, therefore, that the residential population would be a mix of permanent residents, residents on the verge of leaving the municipality with no ongoing interest in the affairs of the Council, tenants, visitors, and other persons whose presence in the municipality was transitory for some reason or another. 

112They further argued that not all ratepayers would be residents in the municipality, if in fact the publication came to the notice of those persons. Likewise, it could not be said that all persons within the business community had an interest in the administration of the affairs of the Council. For example, employees, tradespersons and delivery drivers could not be assumed to have any interest at all in such affairs, but yet may have read the publications, given their indiscriminate distribution. Accordingly, given the wide general publication and the content of the published material, the privilege did not apply in this case.

113The respondents accepted that, in accordance with principle, the public proceedings of a local council in council chambers, where councillors and the general manager engage in discussion of matters of council business, would be an occasion of qualified privilege. The respondents also accepted that a complaint made by a ratepayer about some aspect of council's business would also be protected by qualified privilege. However, they submitted that qualified privilege would not protect the distribution of a ratepayer's complaint to residents in the municipality. The respondents submitted that the trial judge erred in concluding that, provided the subject matter of the communication was of legitimate interest to ratepayers, the privilege was attracted. The error, in the respondents' submission, was that, as previously mentioned, her Honour elided the concept of the public interest and the special and reciprocal interest necessary to attract the privilege.

114The respondents next submitted that given the extent of the publication, the privilege would only have been attracted if the matter fell within the extended category of qualified privilege within the High Court's characterisation in Lange. In this regard, the respondents accepted that the law of defamation generally does not inhibit vigorous debate as to matters of political or governmental interest. However, they contended that defamation of a person on an occasion of political debate was not protected by the privilege unless it fell within the 'election case' category, which they argued did not apply, or was within the Lange extension. 

115Two matters flowed from the argument on the Lange extension. First, if the matter fell within the extended category of qualified privilege, it was necessary for the trial judge to have determined the reasonableness of the publication. She did not do so, because reasonableness was eschewed. Secondly, the respondents contended that the appellants had expressly disavowed any reliance on the extended category. That meant that the claim for qualified privilege must fail, as the distribution was too extensive for there to have been the necessary reciprocity of interest or duty. The respondents accepted that the content of most of the publications contained information about the affairs and administration of the Council and in that respect would have attracted the Lange defence if the test of reasonableness was made out.

116This last submission led to a consideration of the next matter, namely, what is the ""interest"" that falls to be protected by the defence of qualified privilege. Given that the privilege is available where there is a reciprocity of duty or interest, there can be no closed category of cases that would constitute an interest for this purpose. 

117In Howe v Lees, in a passage quoted with approval by Gummow J at 421 in Bashford, Higgins J stated, at 398, of the word 'interest': 

""[T]he word 'interest', as used in the cases, is not used in any technical sense. It is used in the broadest popular sense, as when we say that a man is 'interested' in knowing a fact - not interested in it as a matter of gossip or curiosity, but as a matter of substance apart from its mere quality as news"".

See also Gatley on Libel and Slander, par 14.13.

118The respondents accepted that, in general terms, a relevant interest would be where the provision of the information would assist the recipient to make an important decision or to decide upon a particular course of action: see Austin v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (1985) 3 NSWLR 354 at 358. They contended that this description related to one side only of the duty or interest requirement. There has to be a reciprocity of duty or interest. This was demonstrated in Bashford and Bennette v Cohen. They argued against there being any such reciprocity in this case, and in any event, none was argued by the appellants. 

119The respondents submitted that whatever explanation or description was given to an interest that fell within the privilege, it was established law that a relevant interest did not exist merely because a publication was in respect of public interest: see Morosi v Mirror Newspapers where the Court (Moffitt P, Hope and Reynolds JJA) stated, at 778: 

""It is apparent from these decisions and dicta that, at common law, a publication in a newspaper is not the subject of qualified privilege merely because it gives the public information concerning a matter in respect of which the public is interested. Something more is needed which is said in some circumstances to constitute a duty, and in other circumstances an interest, on the part of the newspaper to communicate the information.""

120The Court further stated, at 792: 

""Newspapers play an important role in our society, but that role does not call for an unrestricted licence to defame people, simply because it can be shown that the defamatory material was part of an article or other form of publication on a matter of public interest, and that the publication was not malicious. Defamatory publications on matters of public interest are protected under the common law, and by statute, in various ways, but something more than mere public interest is required. It may be truth; or it may be reasonableness, in all the circumstances, of the conduct of the publisher in making the publication; or it may be some other requirement.""

121The respondent submitted that her Honour's erroneous approach can be discerned from a consideration of the following passages of her judgment:

""[181] In general terms, what was published by Mr Marshall was published because of his interest, as a Councillor himself, in the affairs of the Council, and was published by him to electors, ratepayers and residents of the municipality, and, (probably) occasionally to others (such as employees of businesses) who used Council facilities, and were affected to some degree, by the manner in which the Council was administered. If the content of the circulars were uniformly the affairs and administration of the Council, it would be a relatively short and easy step to conclude that the occasion of each publication was one of qualified privilege. But that the general purpose of the circulars, as proclaimed in the heading and slogan, was to deal with affairs and administration of the Council, does not necessarily mean that every item in every circular, when examined, contained information about Council business. The mere fact that the circulars bore the banner heading, and the slogan, that they did, does not mean that the entirety of their contents related to those matters. Each item must be considered individually.

...

[184] The evidence on the whole establishes to my satisfaction that, where the subject matter of any item is properly to be seen as Council business and affairs, the necessary reciprocity of interest in that subject matter between Mr Marshall and those to whom the circulars were distributed is demonstrated. In this respect the analogy with election cases is obvious. It does not, however, necessarily follow that each (or, indeed any) individual item is properly to be construed as directed to that subject matter. 

[185] Because Mr Tory is a resident and ratepayer, I am satisfied that he, too, had an interest on that basis alone in communicating with residents and ratepayers with respect to Council affairs. The evidence shows that he has taken an active interest in Council affairs. To some extent, that enhances his interest.

...

[189] For the purpose of the first question, I will proceed upon the basis (as mentioned earlier in this judgment) that Mr Marshall was a Councillor on the Council; that Mr Tory had a relevant interest in Council matters; and that the circulars were distributed to recipients who were ratepayers and residents of the Drummoyne municipality, and had a legitimate interest in receiving information (and opinion or comment) on the functioning of the Council and its Councillors including its Mayor."" (emphases added)

122The respondents next referred to a number of individual publications and her Honour's determination in respect of them as further exemplifications of the error they alleged. 

123The first matter complained of contained two sections giving rise to defamatory imputations. In respect of the second of those, the material appeared under a heading, ""CHUMMY CHUMS, COMFY COMFORT"". Her Honour summarised the content of the publication as follows:

""205 This item opened with reference to a Council business paper that advised that three named Councillors (one of whom was Mr Megna) had recently completed an annual performance review of Mr Lloyd. It went on to assert that Mr Lloyd had been in the position for four years but: 

'... no one can recall when the last annual review was undertaken!' (bold and underlining in original)

206 It said that there had been no previous review in three years, at least in public and then: 

'The fact is - there wasn't one!'

207 The item went on to query the composition of the group selected to conduct the review, suggesting (in scarcely veiled terms) a lack of transparency and impartiality. It asserted that the terms of the contract remained confidential. It queried the credentials of Mr Megna and another Councillor to conduct the review. It concluded with a series of rhetorical questions plainly suggesting that the review was conducted in circumstances less than impartial, and ended with these words: 

'Sounds a bit too 'clubby' for this Association, almost 'goo goo', except for the seriousness of the matter.'""

124The defamatory imputations arising from the publication were:

""● 2(a): that as Mayor of the Council Mr Megna had not been impartial in his appraisal of the performance of Mr Lloyd;

● 2(b): that as Mayor of the Council Mr Megna had not acted in the interests of residents;

● 2(c): that as Mayor of the Council Mr Megna had engaged in personal favouritism in his attitude to the performance of the Council's General Manager.""

125Her Honour held that the matter was published on an occasion of qualified privilege, for the following reasons:

""[215] In my opinion, it can been seen from the terms of the circular itself that the issues it raised concerned the administration of the Council - compliance with the terms of Mr Lloyd's contract of employment, a system for ensuring that the annual review clause it contained was implemented, and that the review was carried out in an impartial and unbiased fashion, were matters of legitimate concern to residents and ratepayers of the municipality. 

[216] The terms of Mr Lloyd's contract, compliance with its conditions, and Mr Lloyd's performance, are all matters on which Mr Marshall and Mr Tory had an interest in informing residents and ratepayers and on which residents and ratepayers had a reciprocal interest in receiving information."" (emphases added)

126The respondents submitted that her Honour's reference to ""legitimate concern"" was synonymous with the public interest.

127The next example related to the third matter complained of. Her Honour observed, at [239], that observations concerning Mr Lloyd's competence as general manager ""[gave] rise to an occasion of qualified privilege"". Her Honour continued, at [240]:

""... it is, nevertheless, a subject matter of relevance to ratepayers and residents. Even on that characterisation, the item was published on an occasion of qualified privilege.""

128The error in this paragraph, according to the respondents, was that her Honour was using the concept of relevance to determine that the publication was on an occasion of qualified privilege. That is, she had determined that because the material was relevant, there was thereby a reciprocity of interest. The respondents contended, however, that relevance does not create the occasion of qualified privilege. Rather, the question of relevance only comes into play if the publisher of the defamatory material has first established that the publication was on an occasion of qualified privilege. 

129Other paragraphs that the respondents asserted exemplified the error were: 

""[258] The meeting times of Council are a matter within the general topic of Council affairs; specifically, the manner in which significant changes to meeting times is brought about is a matter on which Mr Marshall and Mr Tory had an interest in communicating with residents and ratepayers, and residents and ratepayers had a reciprocal interest in receiving. This item was, and these imputations were, published on an occasion of qualified privilege.

...

[276] I am satisfied that the issue of the sale of the land was a matter of significant interest to Mr Marshall and Mr Tory, to the residents and ratepayers of Drummoyne, and therefore created an occasion of qualified privilege. I am further satisfied that what was contained in this item was relevant to that occasion.

...

[286] There is, I accept, something incongruous about a finding that, in a circular proclaiming itself to be concerned with affairs of local government, an occasion of qualified privilege exists to protect a discussion of the merits of a candidate for State political office. But there are two answers to that: as I have said above, the title and slogan of the circulars is not determinative of the existence of such an occasion; and, in my view, the evidence shows that there existed considerable overlap between the relevant State electorate and the Drummoyne municipality. Accordingly, residents and ratepayers of the Drummoyne municipality had an interest in receiving information about any such candidate. As I have said above, the occasion of qualified privilege has to be determined by reference to the content of the individual item. Here, the context is concerned with the suitability of Mr Megna as a potential elected representative in State Parliament. That classically creates an occasion of qualified privilege.""

130At [318], her Honour used the language of ""legitimate interest"" in relation to the impact of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games on traffic and business in the municipality. Her Honour found, at [381], that:

""The remaining question is whether what was published in this circular was relevant to the occasion of qualified privilege. I am satisfied that it was.""

131Her Honour stated, at [396]: 

""The present issue is not whether Mr Lloyd or the author of the circular was right or wrong, but whether the issue was of sufficient public interest to create an occasion of qualified privilege. I am satisfied that it was. This was a matter of considerable debate and division within the municipality."" (emphasis added)

132Her Honour held, at [410], that the advertising of general meetings to allow interested residents and ratepayers to attend was ""a matter of sufficient interest to those residents and ratepayers"" as to be an occasion of qualified privilege. At [435], her Honour made reference to a matter being of ""legitimate interest to residents"". Likewise, at [517]-[522], her Honour referred to a number of matters that were ""legitimate questions""; ""of legitimate interest to residents and ratepayers""; and of ""legitimate public interest ... published on an occasion of qualified interest"".

133Another example, which perhaps summarises her Honour's approach, is to be found at [539]:

""Again somewhat reluctantly, I am satisfied that either the subject matter of access to Council files by Councillors, or the integrity and probity of the Council's Mayor and General Manager, are legitimate subject matters for the communication of information between Mr Marshall and Mr Tory and residents and ratepayers. Accordingly, these imputations were published on an occasion of qualified privilege.""

134Simpson J included in her review of the case law a reference to the judgment of McHugh J in Stephens v West Australian Newspapers Ltd [1994] HCA 45; 182 CLR 211. Her Honour did so in respect of the 'election cases', which I discuss below in a different context. However, I deal with her Honour's reference to Stephens at this point as it provides a significant insight to her overall reasoning on the question of qualified privilege. Her Honour referred to the following remarks of McHugh J at 261-262:

""As the decided cases show, however, circumstances may exist where the interest of the general public in a particular subject is such that a defence of qualified privilege is available even though the communication is made to the general public by means of a newspaper or other medium of general circulation. If a subject is one of public interest, members of the public have the requisite interest in receiving information on that subject from persons who have a corresponding interest or duty to communicate that information to the general public. If such information is published in good faith, both the author and the publisher of the article are protected 'for the common convenience and welfare of society'."" 

At 264-265, his Honour said: 

""In the last decade of the 20th century, the quality of life and the freedom of the ordinary individual in Australia are highly dependent on the exercise of functions and powers vested in public representatives and officials by a vast legal and bureaucratic apparatus funded by public moneys. How, when, why and where those functions and powers are or are not exercised are matters that are of real and legitimate interest to every member of the community. Information concerning the exercise of those functions and powers is of vital concern to the community. So is the performance of the public representatives and officials who are invested with them. It follows in my opinion that the general public has a legitimate interest in receiving information concerning matters relevant to the exercise of public functions and powers vested in public representatives and officials. Moreover, a narrow view should not be taken of the matters about which the general public has an interest in receiving information. With the increasing integration of the social, economic and political life of Australia, it is difficult to contend that the exercise or failure to exercise public functions or powers at any particular level of government or administration, or in any part of the country, is not of relevant interest to the public of Australia generally. If this legitimate interest of the public is to be properly served, it must also follow that on occasions persons with special knowledge concerning the exercise of public functions or powers or the performance by public representatives or officials of their duties will have a corresponding duty or interest to communicate information concerning such functions, powers and performances to members of the general public ...

Accordingly, it is now appropriate for the common law to declare that it is for 'the common convenience and welfare' of Australian society that the existing categories of qualified privilege be extended to protect communications made to the general public by persons with special knowledge concerning the exercise of public functions or powers or the performance of their duties by public representatives or officials invested with those functions and powers."" 

135The following matters should be noted in respect of her Honour's reference to McHugh J's judgment in Stephens v West Australian Newspapers Ltd. First, Stephens v West Australian Newspapers Ltd predated the decision in Lange which is discussed below. Secondly, McHugh J joined in the Court decision in Lange. Thirdly, most importantly for the present discussion, although the second of the paragraphs referred to above was quoted by the Court in Lange, the last paragraph was not. When one has regard to the entirety of her Honour's judgment, it is hard to resist the conclusion that her Honour was influenced by the terms in which McHugh J characterised an occasion of common law qualified privilege. With respect to her Honour, and subject to the matter raised in the s 78B notice, the position is now as stated in Lange.

136If the respondents are correct that her Honour was in effect applying a general notion of public interest as being sufficient to establish an occasion of qualified privilege, then their submission should be upheld. However, it is not clear that is what her Honour did. As I have indicated, her Honour appeared to accept that, analogously with the 'election cases', there was a form of 'public interest' that was sufficient of itself to be an occasion of qualified privilege. As I understand the respondents' argument, that is how they interpret her Honour's reasons. 

137The respondents submitted that the common law qualified privilege that attaches to statements on government and political matters in respect of election matters applies only during ""the election period"", which, on the respondents' argument, was the period from the close of nominations until the election. In support of this submission, the respondents advanced the following propositions. First, the relevant interest is one directed to electors making an informed choice as to the person for whom they vote. That choice is made at the end of the election period. Secondly, the candidates are not necessarily known until nominations close. Thirdly, it is not until the group of candidates is finally known that the policies of the various candidates can be properly assessed against the policies being advanced by other candidates. This is so notwithstanding that some candidates may have been electioneering at an earlier point of time

138On the assumption that these propositions were correct, the respondents submitted that her Honour's apparent reliance upon the privilege that protects defamatory matter directed at a political candidate, at [285]-[288] and [595]-[597] (set out above at [104]-[105]), was erroneous, because the publications fell outside the election period.

The appellants' argument

139The appellants submitted that the principles stated in the 'election cases' are an exposition of the traditional common law defence of qualified privilege and that the principles so expounded are not confined to publications made in the election period. The appellants submitted that Lange, at 561, was authority for this proposition and support for it was also to be found in the comments of the plurality in Roberts v Bass. Mr Tory accepted that he had not invoked the extended Lange defence of qualified privilege. Rather, his argument had been that there was a common law defence of qualified privilege discussed in Lange that did not require reasonableness. As I understand Mr Marshall to have adopted the arguments advanced by Mr Tory, it is not necessary to distinguish between the submissions of the appellants on this issue. 

140Mr Tory conceded that if reasonableness was a requirement of the occasion of qualified privilege that he invoked, he had not made out any such case. Although Mr Marshall did not make the same concession, it is apparent from the material before the Court that Mr Marshall had not attempted to make out a case of reasonableness at trial. However, the appellants contended that the requirement of reasonableness, enunciated in Lange as a necessary condition for an occasion of qualified privilege in the extended sense, only applied in the case of mass media publications. They contended that their case at trial was that the circulars were not mass media publications, so that it was not necessary for them to establish the reasonableness of the matters complained of. 

141In short, the appellants submitted Lange established that if the subject matter of the communication was political discussion, it was not necessary to examine all the circumstances to determine whether it was an occasion of qualified privilege in the sense discussed in the authorities such as: Andreyevich v Kosovich; Guise v Kouvelis [1947] HCA 13; 74 CLR 102; and Bashford. Rather, a communication on political or government matters itself was an occasion of qualified privilege and it was only where the publication was to the public at large that there was a requirement of reasonableness. As the submission was finally articulated it was that the proposition the appellants advanced, ""flowed from Lange itself"" and ""from Roberts v Bass properly understood"". 

142The appellants submitted that at trial they had also invoked the principles stated in Braddock v Bevins, which had been recognised by the High Court in Roberts v Bass and, if necessary, they relied on those principles on the appeal. Subject to the matter referred to in the next paragraph, the appellants accepted that if Lange did not stand for the proposition they advanced, their defence was reliant upon the principles stated in Braddock v Bevins. It was inherent in this argument that the 'election cases' were not confined to the election period as the respondents had submitted. 

143The appellants also contended that if Lange was not authority for the proposition that a publication on a matter of political or government interest was itself an occasion of qualified privilege, or the 'election cases' were in fact confined to the election period, the law should be developed so as to encompass that proposition. This argument raised what was referred to in the course of the appeal as the 'Constitutional Issue'. 

144The following questions emerge from these submissions;

(1) Is the principle stated in the 'election cases' confined to the election period?

(2) Is there an independent category of qualified privilege involving dissemination of political matter that does not import the requirement of reasonableness? 

(3) If not, should the law be developed so as to encompass such a category?

Is the principle stated in the 'election cases' confined to the election period?

145Although none of the authorities make specific reference to the time over which the privilege afforded by the 'election cases' extends, they all involved situations where the publications were made during the election period. However, in support of their submission that the 'election cases' involved the protection of political comment not restricted in time, the appellants relied upon comments in Lange especially, at 561, where the Court stated: 

""If the freedom is to effectively serve the purpose of ss 7 and 24 and related sections [of the Constitution], it cannot be confined to the election period. Most of the matters necessary to enable 'the people' to make an informed choice will occur during the period between the holding of one, and the calling of the next, election. If the freedom to receive and disseminate information were confined to election periods, the electors would be deprived of the greater part of the information necessary to make an effective choice at the election."" (emphasis added)

146That the Court in Lange was stating a general principle in this passage is not borne out by Roberts v Bass, where there are various statements indicating that the 'election cases' are confined to a period that is at least proximate to the holding of an election, even if not as closely confined as the respondents submitted. Thus, Gleeson CJ observed, at [14]:

""As Braddock v Bevins makes clear, when, in the course of an election contest, political views damaging to the reputation of a candidate, deliberately intended to harm his or her prospects of election, are published, what attracts the qualified privilege is interest in the honest expression of views, no matter how strongly put, and no matter how unreasonable they may be. The purpose of the privilege is not to protect dishonesty, or to permit the communication of anything that is represented to be a view, whether or not it is in fact genuinely held."" (emphasis added)

147The plurality (Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ) observed, at [73], that Lange: 

""... was not concerned with statements made by electors or candidates or those working for a candidate, during an election, to electors in a State electorate, concerning the record and suitability of a candidate for election to a State Parliament"". (emphasis added)

148Their Honours, in the same paragraph, made the following observations in respect of statements made during an election period: 

""Such statements are at the heart of the freedom of communication protected by the Constitution. They are published to a comparatively small audience, most of whom have an immediate and direct interest in receiving information, arguments, facts and opinions concerning the candidates and their policies. In that context and constitutional framework, the application of traditional qualified privilege requires a holding that qualified privilege attaches to statements by electors, candidates and their helpers published to the electors of a State electorate on matters relevant to the record and suitability of candidates for the election."" (emphasis added)

149The statement in Lange, at 561, upon which the appellants relied, was made in the context of the Court considering whether the law of defamation was inconsistent with the Constitution insofar as it fettered comment on political and government matters. In that context the Court held, at 571, that the law of defamation needed to be developed to take into account the legitimate interest of all members of the Australian community in being informed on such matters. However, that interest did not give rise to an unfettered right to make statements on such matters. The Court considered that the necessary condition attaching to the exercise of the right to make such statements was reasonableness. The Court's remarks that communications on such matters was not to be confined to the election period are to be read in the context of communications on political and government matters to a mass and indiscriminate audience. 

150Not only was the Court in Lange not concerned with the traditional category of common law qualified privilege of the type found in the 'election cases', it is apparent from the passages from Roberts v Bass referred to above that the High Court viewed those cases as involving a recognised occasion of common law privilege, relating to a certain period, involving identifiable persons and with a content that related to the election or the election campaign. 

151The question immediately under consideration is whether the traditional defence of common qualified privilege, recognised in the species of case referred to as the 'election cases', is confined to a period that bears a relationship to the holding of an election. In my opinion, it would be too prescriptive and arbitrary to find that it was confined to the period after nominations close, as argued by the respondents. It is well known that electioneering by candidates frequently occurs before that period and, in any event, electors may be unaware, and indeed are unlikely to be aware of the date that nominations close. It would be strange if the protection given by the privilege to comments of the type recognised in the 'election cases' was not available during the course of active electioneering for an upcoming election notwithstanding that the date for the election had not been set. 

152At the other end of the spectrum, it would stretch the limits of the law of defamation for the principle to apply to comments made at any time between set election periods, as occurs in some States, and in local government elections, or even between the end of one election and the anticipated next election dates. To allow the protection to apply for such unrestricted periods, would, in my opinion, be inconsistent with its underlying rationale, which is discernable in the comments of the plurality (Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ) in Roberts v Bass, at [73]. 

153Given, as I consider is the case, there will be no precise rule as to when the period during which the privilege will attach other than that the statements must be made proximate to an election, which has been called or is otherwise to be held, the question whether the privilege attaches will involve a factual inquiry and an evaluation of the circumstances to see whether the communication was on an occasion of qualified privilege. 

154If I am correct in this conclusion, the matters complained of in this case were not protected by the privilege discussed in the 'election cases'. Rather, they were all part of a sustained campaign over a long period of time, and were either entirely unrelated to an election or, in the case of the comments relating to Mr Megna, standing for pre-selection for State election, were made in respect of an election that was not to be held until the following year. 

155That leads to a consideration of the second of the three questions outlined at [144] above, which is one of the two central issues raised in the s 78B Notice. As this matter was raised in the Court below, albeit in an alarmingly non-specific way, it is appropriate to express my views on the proposition now advanced. I say alarming, because it is inappropriate and indeed unfair, that a trial judge should have been led into determining a matter without having been advised of the precise way the argument was being put and without the benefit of submissions relevant to the argument being advanced. 

Is there a privilege for political comment without the requirement of reasonableness?

156Senior counsel for Mr Tory submitted that the Court in Lange, at 571, recognised an occasion of qualified privilege in respect of political speech, unfettered by a requirement of reasonableness. In considering the passage upon which Mr Tory relied, it is necessary to consider the context in which the Court made its comments, which commences in the Court's reasons at 560-561. The passage is lengthy and part of it has already been subject of discussion in these reasons. Nonetheless, it needs to be set out in full:

""Communications concerning political or government matters between the electors and the elected representatives, between the electors and the candidates for election and between the electors themselves were central to the system of representative government, as it was understood at federation. While the system of representative government for which the Constitution provides does not expressly mention freedom of communication, it can hardly be doubted, given the history of representative government and the holding of elections under that system in Australia prior to federation, that the elections for which the Constitution provides were intended to be free elections in the sense explained by Birch. Furthermore, because the choice given by ss 7 and 24 must be a true choice with 'an opportunity to gain an appreciation of the available alternatives', as Dawson J pointed out in Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth, legislative power cannot support an absolute denial of access by the people to relevant information about the functioning of government in Australia and about the policies of political parties and candidates for election.

That being so, ss 7 and 24 and the related sections of the Constitution necessarily protect that freedom of communication between the people concerning political or government matters which enables the people to exercise a free and informed choice as electors. Those sections do not confer personal rights on individuals. Rather they preclude the curtailment of the protected freedom by the exercise of legislative or executive power. As Deane J said in Theophanous, they are 'a limitation or confinement of laws and powers [which] gives rise to a pro tanto immunity on the part of the citizen from being adversely affected by those laws or by the exercise of those powers rather than to a 'right' in the strict sense'. In Cunliffe v The Commonwealth, Brennan J pointed out that the freedom confers no rights on individuals and, to the extent that the freedom rests upon implication, that implication defines the nature and extent of the freedom. His Honour said:

'The implication is negative in nature: it invalidates laws and consequently creates an area of immunity from legal control, particularly from legislative control.'

If the freedom is to effectively serve the purpose of ss 7 and 24 and related sections, it cannot be confined to the election period. Most of the matters necessary to enable 'the people' to make an informed choice will occur during the period between the holding of one, and the calling of the next, election. If the freedom to receive and disseminate information were confined to election periods, the electors would be deprived of the greater part of the information necessary to make an effective choice at the election."" (citations omitted) (emphasis added).

157Lange confirmed the traditional category of qualified privilege, which except for a limited category of cases, protected publications to a limited audience where the circumstances established a reciprocity of duty and interest: Lange at 572. The Court referred to Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309 and Loveday v Sun Newspapers Ltd [1938] HCA 28; 59 CLR 503, each of which involved publications in reply to attacks on a plaintiff to the world at large as being within the limited category of cases: see Harbour Radio v Trad. 

158Lange then held that, consistently with the constitutional freedom of political communication, there was also recognised an extended form of qualified privilege which protects a publication, made to a mass audience, that deals with government and political matters, provided that the publisher's conduct is reasonable: Lange at 573. As the Court had earlier stated, at 571, such protection is available because:

""... the Australian community has an interest in disseminating and receiving information, opinions and arguments concerning government and political matters that affect the people of Australia. The duty to disseminate such information is simply the correlative of the interest in receiving it. The common convenience and welfare of Australian society are advanced by discussion - the giving and receiving of information - about government and political matters. The interest that each member of the Australian community has in such a discussion extends the categories of qualified privilege."" (emphasis added)

159The protection afforded by the extended category of qualified privilege was stated to apply to discussion of government and political matters, at both State and local government level, regardless of whether the discussion bore on matters at the federal level: Lange at 571. 

160At 572, the Court analysed the conditions upon which the extended category of qualified privilege should depend. Their Honours first noted that, at common law, the defence was available provided that a publication was made honestly and without malice. That test, however, was not appropriate where the publication was in respect of government or political matters to a large audience. Rather, as their Honours concluded, at 573, ""reasonableness of conduct"" was the ""appropriate criterion"" when the privilege was claimed for a publication in relation to government and political matters. Their Honours, at 573, added:

""But reasonableness of conduct is imported as an element only when the extended category of qualified privilege is invoked to protect a publication that would otherwise be held to have been made to too wide an audience.""

161The Court emphasised that ""[r]easonableness of conduct"" was only a required element where a publication as to government or political matters would not otherwise have attracted the defence. 

162The appellants relied upon the portion of the passage, at 571, that is emphasised above, as establishing that communications on political and government matters are occasions of privilege without the need to examine all of the circumstances. 

163The appellants submitted that support for their argument was also to be found in Roberts v Bass. That case was concerned with malice. Nonetheless, various observations were made in the judgments of Gleeson CJ and the plurality relating to qualified privilege generally, which touch upon the question presently in issue. Gleeson CJ, in particular, noted that there appeared to be a present incongruity in the law relating to political discussion. As his Honour observed, at [3]: 

""The need for the common law to conform to the Constitution is difficult to reconcile with the co-existence of two significantly different tests for qualified privilege in the context of political debate: the first, the test for common law qualified privilege as recognised in Braddock v Bevins; the second, the test formulated by this Court in Lange."" (citation omitted)

164His Honour expressed a similar concern, at [4], when he stated: 

""If ... there is one category of common law privilege relating to communications to thousands of electors in the course of an election, of the kind recognised in Braddock v Bevins, and another category relating to communications to the general public about political matters, of the kind recognised in Lange, then it seems clear that there is a substantial difference between them. Why this should be so, as a matter of principle, is difficult to understand. The law of defamation, including the law as to qualified privilege, strikes a balance between competing interests. Those interests include the public interest in freedom of political debate, which is essential to the functioning of representative democracy. Why should the balance that applies when a newspaper with a wide circulation publishes an article about the Prime Minister, or the Leader of the Opposition, differ from the balance that applies when someone distributes throughout an electorate a pamphlet urging electors to vote against the sitting member?"" 

165These passages do not support the appellants' argument. Apart from drawing attention to the incongruity to which I have referred, the Chief Justice's comments confirm the substantial difference that exists between the traditional defence of qualified privilege of which the 'election cases' form part, and the defence as extended in Lange. There is nothing in these passages that would suggest that there is an independent category of qualified privilege attaching to political comment, that do not fall within the 'election cases', and in respect of which there is no requirement of reasonableness. 

166The plurality in Roberts v Bass, at [68]-[69], further observed that:

""Three points in particular should be noted concerning the development of the defence of qualified privilege in Lange. First, in extending the law of qualified privilege to protect publications concerning governmental and political matters to mass audiences, the Court imposed as a condition of the extended privilege that the publisher's conduct be reasonable. But the Court emphasised: 

'reasonableness of conduct is imported as an element only when the extended category of qualified privilege is invoked to protect a publication that would otherwise be held to have been made to too wide an audience. For example, reasonableness of conduct is not an element of that qualified privilege which protects a member of the public who makes a complaint to a Minister concerning the administration of his or her department. Reasonableness of conduct is an element for the judge to consider only when a publication concerning a government or political matter is made in circumstances that, under the English common law, would have failed to attract a defence of qualified privilege.'

Secondly, in Lange, the Court held that, having regard to the subject matters of government and politics, the motive of causing political damage to the plaintiff or his or her party is not an improper motive that would destroy a defence of qualified privilege. The Court also held that the vigour of an attack or the pungency of a defamatory statement concerning such matters cannot, without more, discharge the plaintiff's onus on the issue of malice. Thirdly, in some respects the Court's development of the law of qualified privilege extended beyond what was required for conformity with the constitutional norm. 

The present case concerns publications relating to the record and policies of a candidate for election to State Parliament for the seat of Florey. They were directed to, and generally received by, a limited class of persons the electors in the seat of Florey. As will appear, the traditional common law defence of qualified privilege protects such publications because the reciprocity of interest required for the traditional defence is present. As will also appear, given the decision in Lange, that privilege will not be lost because the publisher intends to cause political damage to the candidate or his or her party. Nor will the privilege be lost merely because of the vigour of an attack on a candidate for election to Parliament that is contained in a defamatory statement concerning the record and policies of the candidate. Without more, the vigour of the attack is not evidence of improper motive. As pointed out below, the privilege will be lost only if it is used for a purpose other than that for which it is granted in this case, the communicating of information, arguments, facts and opinions concerning Bass and his policies to the electors of Florey. Thus, although the common law rules of defamation make defamatory statements concerning a candidate for election actionable and impose a burden on an elector's freedom of communication, those rules also protect an elector who uses the occasion for the purpose that gives rise to the constitutional freedom. Hence the burden does not affect what is required to give effect to the constitutional freedom."" (citations omitted)

167In my opinion, these passages do not support the appellants' argument. Rather, they are a confirmation of the existence of the two categories of qualified privilege. However, the appellants relied upon the further observations of the plurality, at [73], that Lange did not ""exhaustively [define] the constitutional freedom's impact on the law of defamation"". Rather Lange had ""dealt with publications to the general public by the general media concerning 'government and political matters'"" and not with statements made during an election by electors or candidates, or those working for a candidate, ""concerning the record and suitability of a candidate for election to a State Parliament"". In respect of traditional common law qualified privilege, including its application to the election cases, their Honours observed that statements falling into these categories:

""... are at the heart of the freedom of communication protected by the Constitution. They are published to a comparatively small audience, most of whom have an immediate and direct interest in receiving information, arguments, facts and opinions concerning the candidates and their policies. In that context and constitutional framework, the application of traditional qualified privilege requires a holding that qualified privilege attaches to statements by electors, candidates and their helpers published to the electors of a State electorate on matters relevant to the record and suitability of candidates for the election.""

Consideration 

168The appellants' argument, as I understand it, required acceptance of the following propositions. First, Lange recognised the constitutional protection of freedom of communication concerning political or government matters. Secondly, that freedom was not confined to the election period. Thirdly, there was a reciprocity in the provision and receipt of such communications. It was not necessary, therefore, in such cases to consider all the circumstances to determine whether there was an occasion of qualified privilege. Fourthly, given that the High Court recognised that discussion of government or political matters at State and local government levels was amenable to protection by the extended category, it followed that discussion on those matters fell within the recognised and accepted constitutional freedom concerning political or government matters generally. Finally, and most importantly for the appellants' argument, the requirement of reasonableness only applied in respect of communications in the mass media. 

169It cannot be accepted that the Court's statement in Lange, at 560-561, provides support for the appellants' argument that there is a constitutionally protected freedom of communications concerning political or governmental matters:

""... between the electors and the elected representatives, between the electors and the candidates for election and between the electors themselves"". 

170In the context of directing attention to such communications, the Court stated, at 561, that the constitutional freedom enjoyed by such persons was not confined to the election period. Those remarks were made in a section of the judgment where the Court expressed its recognition of traditional common law qualified privilege, of which the 'election cases' are a species. The question which arises, therefore, is whether the Court was thereby saying that publications on political and government matters, not being mass media publications, were protected occasions of qualified privilege of an independent category from the traditional defence. 

171As I have indicated, this was the subject of comment in Roberts v Bass. I have expressed my opinion as to the nature of the observations made by Gleeson CJ at [3]-[4]. His Honour's comments, at [14], recognised that the 'election cases' involve the application of traditional qualified privilege. To the extent the plurality made a comment on the 'election cases', they did so by way of observation, at [73], that Lange:

""... was not concerned with statements made by electors or candidates or those working for a candidate, during an election, to electors in a State electorate, concerning the record and suitability of a candidate for election to a State Parliament.""

172It should be noted that comments in Roberts v Bass, to which I have referred, were obiter, as the Court confined the parties to the basis upon which the proceedings had been conducted at first instance and on appeal, namely, whether any defence of qualified privilege was defeated by malice.

173An apparent attempt to carve out or create a third area of qualified privilege, not within the traditional common law approach and unaffected by the requirement of reasonableness, was rejected by Basten JA in The Korean Times Pty Ltd & Anor v Un Dok Pak [2011] NSWCA 365. His Honour, at [30], considered that it was apparent from Roberts v Bass ""that there [was] no room for some third category of cases, limited only by a requirement of honesty of purpose"". Rather, as his Honour explained, at [33]:

""... there may be cases, like the present one and Roberts v Bass, where a defendant whose publication appears to fall squarely within the scope of the expanded doctrine, seeks to rely upon the traditional scope of the defence, thus avoiding the need to prove the reasonableness of their conduct. That there may be an area of overlap, does not, however, demonstrate that there is a third category, involving an extension of the conventional area, but governed only by an exclusion for malice or abuse of purpose.""

174In my opinion, neither Lange nor Roberts v Bass provides support for the appellants' argument. Neither case creates or supports an argument for the existence of an independent category of case, which does not fall within the traditional category of qualified privilege and which is unconfined by the requirement of reasonableness. Although in The Korean Times v Un Dok Pak, I did not join in the comments of Basten JA to which I have just referred as I considered the case was properly determined on a different basis, I agree with his Honour's remarks that the authorities do not establish a third category of qualified privilege. 

175The appellants did not argue in the Court below that their conduct was reasonable, and accepted in this Court that they had not made out a case of reasonableness. It follows, therefore, that their claim that the publications were protected by an independent category of qualified privilege that did not require reasonableness, fails. 

Separate position of Mr Lloyd

176Mr Lloyd submitted that even if it was sufficient for the appellants to establish a public interest or legitimate concern that the ratepayers and residents would have in the affairs of the Council, his position was different, as he was not an elected member of the Council, but was a public official.

177In my opinion, the principle articulated in the 'election cases' does not extend to Mr Lloyd regardless of what period of time is encompassed by that category of case. He was not an elected representative and was not running for public office. Accordingly, his case fell to be determined solely on the basis of whether there was the necessary reciprocity of duty and interest in the making and receiving of the publications in question. For the reasons already given, I consider that her Honour erred in finding that it was sufficient for the appellants to establish that there was a public interest in the content of the matters complained of.

Conclusion on qualified privilege

178As will be seen from what I have said, the appellants argued that the imputations subject of the cross-appeal were protected by the defence of qualified privilege on a limited basis as had been found by the trial judge. I have concluded that on the present state of the law, there is no such available protection. It follows, therefore, that the respondents should succeed on this aspect of their cross-appeal. This was not a case where the recipients of the information in the publications were members of, for example, an existing ratepayers association, thereby demonstrating that they had an active interest in the affairs of the Council. These were the views of one or two people only. In my view, there is no duty for any person to convey their personal political views nor is there any reciprocal interest in persons receiving such unsolicited comments. As the paragraphs referred to demonstrate, the trial judge considered the occasion was one of qualified privilege because the matters complained of were legitimately matters of public concern. However, as was established in Lange and Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Ltd, that is not sufficient for the purposes of the traditional common law defence. 

179Her Honour should have applied the same approach to the imputations subject of the appeal. Although her Honour held that those imputations were not protected by the defence of qualified privilege, she did so on a different basis, as is discussed below. Given what I consider to be the correct approach to the law of qualified privilege on the present High Court authorities, her Honour should have found that the defence of qualified privilege failed in respect of all imputations for the reasons I have given. I do not consider it to be either necessary or appropriate to enter into the further question whether the law should be developed so as to encompass a category of case of political comment, which will be protected by the defence of qualified privilege without the requirement of reasonableness. I would only comment that I would be surprised if the law was developed in the way propounded by the appellants, so as to establish an unconstrained right to publish defamatory material in respect of political comment. 

Challenge on the appeal to trial judge's rejection of qualified privilege and relevance

180The appellants appealed against her Honour's finding that imputations 6(a), 8(b), 8(c), 12(a), 12(b), 12(c), 12(d), 14(a), 14(b), 14(c), 14(d), 14(e), 18(a), 24(a), 24(c), 24(d), 24(e), 24(f), 26(a), 26(b), 26(c), 26(d), 26(f), 26(g), 28(b), 28(c), 28(d), 30(a), 32(e) and 32(f) were not published on an occasion of qualified privilege. The appellants' complaint was that her Honour erred in finding that, except in respect of imputations 8(b) and 8(c), there was no occasion of qualified privilege and that these imputations were not relevant to the occasion in respect of which they were published. 

181The appellants' case on the appeal only arises if I am wrong in concluding that the defence of qualified privilege failed in respect of all imputations. 

182Mr Marshall's submissions on the appeal comprised submissions filed under the hand of Mr Hmelnitsky of counsel dated 27 May 2011 and his further oral submissions on the hearing of the appeal, by which time Mr Marshall was conducting his own case. 

183Mr Tory was not initially an active party to the appeal, having filed a submitting appearance. However, he was granted leave to withdraw the submitting appearance on certain conditions, including that the appeal be conducted on the grounds of appeal and the submissions already filed under the hand of Mr Hmelnitsky. 

184The focus of Mr Tory's argument was that her Honour erred in her articulation of the test for relevance. Indeed, this was described by senior counsel for Mr Tory as being ""the narrow point ... raised by the appeal"" and the only point to which oral argument was addressed. However, I do not understand that the challenge to her Honour's finding that there was no occasion of qualified privilege was abandoned. If it was, Mr Tory's argument in respect of all imputations the subject of the appeal, other than 8(b) and 8(c), would fail. In any event, as Mr Marshall's appeal challenges her Honour's finding that there was no occasion of qualified privilege in respect of the imputations subject of the appeal other than 8(b) and 8(c), it is necessary to consider that challenge also. In dealing with the first aspect of the appeal, that is whether her Honour erred in finding that there was no occasion of qualified privilege, any reference to the imputations subject of the appeal should now be read so as to exclude those two imputations identified above. 

Occasion of qualified privilege 

185The appellants contended that in finding that there was no occasion of qualified privilege her Honour did not reject the defence because there was no interest or duty in communicating the material in the matters complained of. Rather, she rejected the defence because of the language used and the lack of any internal logic in the circulars. The appellants' submission also recognised that her Honour did not consider that the tone or actual language used was so extreme so as to deny the availability of the defence. To the extent Mr Marshall's oral submission contended otherwise, that is, that her Honour rejected the defence because of the ""vituperative"" tone of the circulars, that submission should be rejected.

186The appellants submitted that her Honour's error was typified by her reasoning in respect of the twelfth matter complained of, being the circular dated September 1999 headed ""COUNCIL AMALGAMATION"", which conveyed imputations 24(a)-(f) (set out in full below at [244]). Essentially the imputations conveyed were that both respondents were dishonest in their respective capacities of Mayor and General Manager. 

187The appellants pointed out that the trial judge had earlier found, at [446], in relation to the eleventh matter complained of, that the question of Council amalgamation was a matter ""of very considerable concern to residents and ratepayers in the municipality"" and that the imputations conveyed by that matter were published on an occasion of qualified privilege. However, in dealing with the imputations subject of the appeal, the appellants complained her Honour erred in separating out from the article as a whole that part of the article from which the imputations arose so as to determine whether those aspects conveyed either information or an opinion. 

188The appellants contended that the task required to be undertaken when assessing whether a matter was subject of an occasion of qualified privilege was to assess the matter complained of as a whole. I agree with that particular submission. Whether her Honour transgressed in that way is a different question, to which I will return. 

189The appellant also submitted that it was ""beside the point"" whether the content of the article could be labelled ""facts"" or ""information"". They contended that it was sufficient that ""the content of the circular which gave rise to the imputations was on the subject matter of the privileged occasion and was relevant to it. No more was required"". This submission is also correct in that it refers to the content of the circulars. 

190However, as I understand her Honour's reasoning on the imputations subject of the appeal, her finding was that the content of each particular item, in reality bore no or such little connection with the purported subject matter that there was no occasion of qualified privilege. It was in this respect that her Honour, at [468], referred to there being ""no semblance of communication of information"" conveyed on that subject matter. Thus, although the twelfth matter complained of appeared under the banner ""COUNCIL AMALGAMATION"", her Honour considered that there was but the barest or most superficial connection with that subject matter. Whilst that is strictly the matter in question on the second of the two issues raised on this aspect of the appeal, her Honour was, in effect stating, the particular item was not about council amalgamations at all. This was in contrast to the eleventh matter complained of, where the content of the article was in fact about that matter, and in respect of which her Honour found that there was an occasion of qualified privilege. 

191Accordingly, the generalised attack made on her Honour's findings in respect of the imputations subject of the appeal, fails. I will consider the balance of the imputations in dealing with the question of relevance, as her Honour used essentially the same approach to the determination of that question, that is, by reference to the question whether any information or opinion was conveyed in the matters complained of. 

Relevance 

192For there to be an occasion of qualified privilege which protects a person from liability for defamatory publications, there must be a sufficient connection to the privileged occasion to attract the defence. As the plurality explained in Bashford, at [22], an occasion of qualified privilege does not give a licence to defame. Rather:

""It denies the inference of malice that ordinarily follows from showing that false and injurious words have been published""

193A wrong or inaccurate statement of fact does not, of itself, sever the necessary connection with the privileged occasion or prevent the privileged occasion from arising. In Bashford, the matter complained of incorrectly stated that the plaintiff had been found guilty of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), s 52 whereas the party that had engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct had been a company controlled by the plaintiff and his wife. Notwithstanding that the published matter was inaccurate, it was held to be sufficiently connected, or in the language used in that case, at [29], ""did not alter or reduce the connection between the privileged occasion and the defamatory matter"". 

194French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ made a similar observation in Cush v Dillon, at [19], when they observed that:

""...[there] may be limits to what may be said upon a subject on an occasion of qualified privilege and that those limits are to be tested by the connection of the statement to the subject.""

195In Cush v Dillon, it was held that an occasion of privilege arose in circumstances where the defendant had a duty to disclose information relating to staffing matters in a statutory body and the recipient of the information had a duty to receive it. The defamatory matter was publication of a comment that the general manager and a staff member were having an affair. It was held that the terms of the matter complained of were such as to elevate the subject matter from there being a rumour of the affair to the fact of an affair. That statement was not true and not believed by the defendant to be true. The plaintiff had conceded that the occasion of privilege extended to the communication of the existence of a rumour. The plurality held, at [23], that: 

""It could not ... then be suggested that the communication of the fact of an affair was less relevant to the matters discussed than a rumour. The error inherent in the statement does not deny the privilege."" 

196Hayne and Bell JJ made the same point, noting, at [52], that an inaccuracy in relation to the subject matter, which is otherwise relevant, will not necessarily render the statement ""irrelevant to the privileged occasion"". Their Honours referred to the statement of Dixon J in Guise v Kouvelis, at 118, that, for the connection to be severed the words used must be ""so foreign to the occasion that they must be held extraneous or irrelevant"".

197Gummow J also made the same point in Bashford, at [126], observing that it was well established that the inaccuracy of an imputation was no bar to the availability of the defence of qualified privilege arising out of a reciprocal duty or interest. As his Honour explained:

""This is because the particular relationship between the defendant and the person in receipt of the communication, and the advantages which the law deems are to be had from free communication within such a relationship, enjoy a significance over and above the accuracy of the defamatory imputation in question.""

See also Bashford at [27]-[30] and [199].

198These statements reflect the remarks of Earl Loreburn in Adam v Ward at 320-321, to which the plurality in Cush v Dillon referred. Earl Loreburn commented that anything ""not relevant and pertinent"" to the discharge of the duty or the safeguarding of the interest, which creates the privilege will not be protected. Accordingly, it was necessary to determine, in a particular case, whether what the defendant published went ""beyond what was germane and reasonably appropriate to the occasion"". 

199Other descriptions of the necessary connection were used in Adam v Ward. Lord Dunedin, at 327, used the expression ""quite unconnected with and irrelevant to the main statement"". Lord Atkinson, at 340, referred to ""foreign and irrelevant"" matter and Lord Shaw of Dunfermline, at 348, to a matter which was ""not in any reasonable sense germane"" to what was being conveyed in the discharge of the duty or the protection of interest.

200In Cush v Dillon, French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ did not determine whether there was any difference of substance in the various statements in Adam v Ward. Rather, at [22], they accepted, as had been said in Toogood v Spyring, that a narrow view should not be taken of what constitutes a sufficient connection, otherwise the scope of the defence may be unduly restricted. 

201Likewise, the use of excessive or extravagant language does not prevent there being a sufficient connection to the privileged occasion. In Cush v Dillon French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ accepted, at [24], the distinction drawn by Lord Esher MR in Nevill v Fine Arts and General Insurance Co [1895] 2 QB 156 at 170 between an excessive statement, which nonetheless was relevant to the privileged occasion, and the circumstances in which an excessive statement, made within the privileged occasion, may nonetheless be evidence of malice. Earl Loreburn had also noted this distinction in Adam v Ward when his Lordship observed, at 321, that exaggerated words used on an occasion of privilege may be evidence of malice but ""the two things are different"". The question of malice is considered below. The present point is that the language used, of itself even if excessive, is not the determinant of whether there is a sufficient connection between the defamatory material and the privileged occasion. 

202The question whether defamatory material was relevant to the occasion was considered by Heydon J in Papaconstuntinos at [75] ff. His Honour considered that two inquiries emerged from the statement of Parke B in Toogood v Spyring: first, whether there was a privileged occasion at all; and secondly, whether the legitimate purposes of the occasion were exceeded. His Honour considered that the factual analysis of each may overlap and further noted that these two inquiries were separate from malice. His Honour referred to the following passage in Andreyevich v Kosovich at 361-362, where Jordan CJ said: 

""If, at the trial of a defamation action, facts are established which satisfy the Judge that the occasion of the publication complained of was one of qualified privilege, the defendant is entitled to a verdict, save to the extent to which it appears to the Judge that the defamatory matter exceeded what was reasonably incidental to the legitimate purposes of the occasion, or that its publication was wider than was reasonably proper to serve those purposes, or (if, in the opinion of the Judge, there is evidence of express malice) unless it is established by the plaintiff to the satisfaction of the jury that the defamatory statement was animated by express malice."" (Heydon J's emphasis)

203Heydon J continued that Jordan CJ's reference to ""occasion"", ""reasonably incidental"" and ""malice"" identified three separate inquiries, the first two of which were raised by the statement of Parke B in Toogood v Spyring. His Honour noted that defamatory material was not ""'reasonably incidental to the legitimate purposes of the occasion' ... where the defamatory material is extraneous to the occasion because it is irrelevant or not germane"". Thus, an evaluation of the material is required, questions of ""judgment and degree"" being involved: Bellino v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1996] HCA 47; 185 CLR 183 at 246-248 per Gaudron J. 

204Heydon J, at [76], also explained the distinction between the enquiry as to whether there was an occasion of privilege and the question of malice:

""The distinction between the question whether an occasion was privileged and the question whether what happened on that occasion was reasonably incidental to its legitimate purposes can be drawn as follows. A privileged occasion is an occasion on which the defendant has an interest in making or a duty to make a defamatory statement. The requirement that what was stated must have been reasonably incidental to the legitimate purposes of the occasion goes to how that privileged occasion was used. The latter requirement is different from malice, though the evidence going to that requirement can also go to the malice issue."" (citations omitted)

205Finally, it is important to note that Heydon J, at [77], expressed the view that:

""... the terms of the defamatory material are relevant to the question whether the occasion was privileged and to the question whether the defamatory matter exceeded what was reasonably incidental to the legitimate purposes of the occasion."" 

His Honour recognised that this statement was contrary to what was sometimes said in the authorities. That comment appears to indicate that in his Honour's view, it was possible that the language may be in such intemperate terms as to exceed what was legitimate for the occasion. This understanding of his Honour's remarks is supported by his Honour's references to Bellino. 

Appellants' submissions

206The appellants submitted that the test applied by her Honour as to the necessary connection between the matters complained of and the occasion was wrong. They contended that, for an occasion not to be privileged, or for the occasion not to extend to the defamatory material, it was necessary to establish that there was no connection at all between the matters complained of and the occasion. 

207The appellants submitted that in order for material to be found to be irrelevant to the occasion of qualified privilege, the material must be ""truly unconnected with the subject matter of the occasion"" (Bashford at [43] per Hodgson JA), that is, it must be ""so foreign to the occasion"" that the material must be held to be ""extraneous or irrelevant"": Guise v Kouvelis at 118. They submitted that their argument found support in the comment in Cush v Dillon, at [22], that a narrow view should not be taken of what is relevant. The appellants contended this was the test that had been applied by Hodgson JA in the Court of Appeal in Bashford. In short, they submitted that the test was one of ""no connection"", that is, a statement had to be totally outside the subject matter of the occasion of the privilege before it could be said that the occasion of privilege was thereby defeated or did not arise.

208The appellant submitted that if any other test was applied, the defence of qualified privilege would, in effect, become ""illusory"": see Horrocks v Lowe [1975] AC 135 at 151 per Lord Diplock, and would be the subject of varying evaluative interpretations by trial judges so as to be time-consuming in its proof and uncertain in its outcome. They submitted, by reference to the present case, that if too stringent a test was required, it would impede the ability of persons to make a contribution to political debate, being an occasion of qualified privilege meant to protect individuals engaging in such conduct. The other party was relevantly protected by being able to respond in kind: see Harbour Radio v Trad at [116].

209In the passage in Horrocks v Lowe upon which the appellants relied, Lord Diplock, at 151, referred to material that was irrelevant to the occasion of privilege in that it was ""not really necessary to the fulfilment of the particular duty or the protection of the particular interest upon which the privilege was founded"". In his Lordship's opinion, such material may be evidence that the publication was for an improper purpose, thus affording evidence of malice. 

Resolution of trial judge's approach to relevance in respect of the imputations subject of the appeal

210The trial judge held, in respect of the imputations subject of the appeal, that the defamatory statements were not made on an occasion of qualified privilege. This was primarily because the content of the relevant circulars could not be characterised as being sufficiently informative in a sense of conveying either information or opinion on the subject matter of the occasion. The appellants referred to the passages in her Honour's judgment in respect of each of the imputations subject of the appeal. It is therefore necessary to deal separately with each of the matters complained of that gave rise to those imputations. The extracts below from the matters complained of are reproduced verbatim.

211At [249], her Honour was dealing with imputations 6(a) and 6(b), which were in the following terms: 

""● 6(a): that as Mayor of the Council Mr Megna is incompetent;

● 6(b): that as General Manager of the Council Mr Lloyd is incompetent.""

212The imputations were said to arise from the final paragraph (bolded below) of the third matter complained of, which was contained in a circular dated May 1998 and appeared under the heading ""MESSAGE FROM THE MAYOR, '98"" as follows:

""Drummoyne Council Autumn news publication arrived recently. What a 'gooby' sugarine type of dribble engulfs that newsletter. Have you ever seen anything other than insignificant back-slapping content in these quarterly issues from our Council. The only problem we have is that it is issued at your cost, the ratepayer. Worse still, this issue carries a photo of the unregistered architect appointed to the Civic Centre refurbishment by the general manager (see our March '98 circular).

Megna has again referred to his worn out cassette tape for the usual clichés in his derogatory comments about this circular. We answer. This circular is not anonymous. It is published by a group of concerned residents of this Municipality who have been lied to by Megna, Councillors and Council Management and who wish to make public the atrocious decision-making, lies and waste of public moneys in this Council.

This Association has no need to justify itself, it is not the Mayor or the Council General Manager, is not a community elected representative and is irrelevant in the scheme of all things local. Megna may level any amount of criticism at this Association, but it is he and Lloyd who are to answer to ratepayers, and already the latter are very aware of who and where the problems are. The truth will validate our circulars.

Megna invites constructive criticism. He and Lloyd have now had a long time in office to iniatiate the first 'turning of the soil' in rectification of so many matters in this Municipality. We haven't even seen the first shovel full yet! Plenty of talk, determinations, meetings, initiatives, but nothing real at all. We see no community leadership of a tackling of the major issues, just 'feet in the trough'. We all know just what is to be done. 

Megna, in particular, bristles when under criticism, and yet invites it to be constructive. His involvement in so many items is real, but he cannot rectify, he just attends. The fact is that both Megna and Lloyd have not shown they possess the skills necessary for their respective positions. That is clear."" (emphasis added)

213Her Honour considered, at [244], that the reference to the Association not having to justify itself was what she would term ""self defence"". Her Honour accepted, at [248], that each of the paragraphs in the matter complained of came under the ""general rubric of Council affairs and management"", but ""on a more specific level the subject matter [was] fluid"". In this regard, her Honour noted that the first paragraph was an attack on the Council newsletter; the second concerned apparent hostilities between the purported Ratepayers Association and some members of the Council, including Mr Megna; the third and fourth paragraphs were largely a criticism of Mr Megna and Mr Lloyd in their respective capacities of Mayor and General Manager; and the final paragraph, from which the imputations arose, was a comment upon their performances. 

214Her Honour held, at [249], that the matter complained of was not published on an occasion of qualified privilege for, essentially, two reasons. First, no, or at least very little, factual information was conveyed. Secondly, no rational opinion was conveyed. Her Honour's reasoning, at [249], was as follows:

""Because the defamatory imputations were conveyed by the last paragraph, consideration of the occasion of qualified privilege must focus upon what is contained therein, perhaps allowing some reference to the immediately preceding paragraph. The criticisms made are non-specific, but that does not necessarily prevent an occasion being subject to qualified privilege if the necessary interest and reciprocity are present. But analysis of the item demonstrates that there is, in reality, very little (if anything) in the way of factual information contained in these paragraphs. Nor is there any rational opinion conveyed. Although the competence of Mr Megna as Mayor and Mr Lloyd as General Manager are both subjects which justify the communication of information or opinion, to create an occasion of qualified privilege it is necessary that the communication have some content. This item fails to meet that basic requirement. There is no occasion of qualified privilege. If there were such an occasion, the imputations of incompetence (or the single sentence that conveys those imputations) would have the necessary relevance.""

215The appellants submitted that neither of these matters, that is, information and rational opinion, needed to be conveyed for the matter complained of to have the necessary connection with the privileged occasion. They submitted that the circular was directed to pointing out that, contrary to the assertion that had been made in the communication from the Mayor, the Association did not need to justify itself, as it was not a community of elected representatives. Further, it had a legitimate reason for existing, namely, to draw to the attention of ratepayers the Council's appalling administration. The fact that the views expressed therein were strident did not mean that there was no or insufficient connection with the subject matter of the occasion, namely, political debate relating to the Council and its affairs, including the conduct of the respondents. This was not just an unseemly argument between two individuals. Indeed, the appellants submitted her Honour recognised that the material was relevant to the occasion. Her Honour's error was in finding that as the material had no content, the occasion was not privileged. 

216A superficial reading of the trial judge's reasons, at [249], might suggest that her Honour separated out, from the matter complained of as a whole, that part that gave rise to the imputations, to ascertain whether those matters conveyed information or opinion that would given rise to a privileged occasion. Such an approach may have led her Honour into error but I do not consider her Honour erred in that way. Rather, it is apparent from her Honour's reasoning that she had regard to the whole of the item and was not satisfied that that material was published on an occasion of qualified privilege. I see no error in her Honour's evaluation either of the matter complained of as a whole or the relevance of the imputations. 

217The appellants next referred to the fourth matter complained of contained in a circular dated August 1998, which appeared under the heading ""LEP DRAFT AMENDMENTS"". The article was in the following terms:

""The Council's monthly meeting on 21/7/98 proposed amendments to the Drummoyne Local Environment Plan 1986. It is in draft form at present on display. Briefly and in part, it's meant to encourage freehold commercial and shop owner/operators to develop/improve their properties/businesses.

In summary, despite efforts by Cnrs [F] and Marshall (in tandem with local property owners' advices) to improve Floor Space Ratios in Five Dock, Councillors voted only marginal increases to the FSR. There will also be some small changes in Drummoyne. We've relegated this article to brevity status as it has become quite evident that Council Management's view of a changed Drummoyne, in particular, leaves much to be desired. Do they really believe investors are to come rushing forth to clamour for freehold and business purchases and development without carparking resolvement, without a total package, a 10 year Plan, a comprehensive package involving all aspects? Why would Five Dock freehold owners demolish their buildings or complete major alterations if only to gain a slight increase in floor space ratios in a replacement building? A dope could see that they won't. So, Council, again have done nothing worthwhile to assist!

The smirks from Lloyd and Megna were noted at the meeting when one Councillor commenced a preamble about underground carparks. How on earth could that be paid for or even receive approval consent, the smirks revealed? neither had a clue. Those smirks did reveal one thing, i.e., Neither possess the ability required in their respective positions. We know it. residents are starting to know it, and they both know it!"" (emphasis added)

218The article gave rise to the following imputations: 

""● 8(b): that as Mayor of the Council Mr Megna is incompetent;

● 8(c): that as General Manager of the Council Mr Lloyd is incompetent."" 

219Her Honour accepted, at [296], that the publication of information concerning the debate and the issues referred to gave rise to an occasion of qualified privilege, but that the last paragraph (see bolded portion above) which gave rise to the imputations was not. Her Honour's reasons were as follows: 

""I am satisfied that the publication of information concerning the debate, and the issues, gave rise to an occasion of qualified privilege. The first two of the three paragraphs of this item are directed to that subject matter, and were therefore published under qualified privilege. However, the last paragraph, from which the imputations arise, is not directed (ie relevant or germane) to that subject. They were therefore not published on an occasion of qualified privilege. Even if it could be held that they were published on such an occasion by reason of the association with the first two, protected, paragraphs, it is not shown that the reaction of Mr Megna and Mr Lloyd to an apparently extraneous comment about underground car parks - or the inference of incompetence drawn by the author of the item from 'smirks' was relevant to that occasion."" 

220The appellants submitted her Honour erred in finding that the topic of underground car parks was extraneous to the occasion. In this regard, there was evidence there had been discussion of underground car parks at the Council meeting to which the circular was directed. They submitted that the reference to the respondents' conduct in ""smirking"" when this issue was raised was indicative that they did not know what they were doing, that is, they were incompetent, otherwise they would have taken the discussion seriously. 

221Her Honour's approach in disconnecting the paragraph from which the imputations arose from the general content of the item, and from the evidence that there had been discussion about car parks at the meeting, was, in my opinion, erroneous. The question for determination therefore is whether the defamatory comments were relevant to the occasion subject of the portion of the article found by her Honour to be protected by the defence of qualified privilege. This in turn depends, in my opinion whether her Honour correctly found that the reference in the defamatory paragraph to car parking was ""extraneous"" to the occasion. 

222In my opinion, it was not. The item was about commercial development to be permitted in the proposed amendment to the Local Environmental Plan including what was to be allowed by way of floor space ratios. Questions of car parking were also in issue, as was stated in the protected portion of the article. The defamatory comments clearly imputed to the respondents a reaction to that topic that demonstrated their incompetence. It follows that her Honour erred on the question of relevance in respect of imputations 8(b) and 8(c). 

223The appellants next challenged her Honour's findings in respect of the sixth and seventh matters complained of. It is convenient to deal with them together. The sixth matter complained of related to imputations 12(a) and 12(b), in respect of which the appellants did not address any particular submission, and imputations 12(c) and 12(d). 

224Imputations 12(a) and (b) arose out of an item in the October 1998 circular entitled ""SAME MAYOR, SPLIT COUNCIL"". This item reported that Mr Megna had been re-elected as Mayor for a third term and that Mr Lloyd had been reappointed as General Manager for a five-year term. The respondents were described as ""a cosy and matey team"". The item also alleged that they had been responsible for a trading loss by Council of $857,000 in the last financial year. The first paragraph of the item, upon which the imputations were based, stated:

""For Megna, greed is good. Talk about ego! The man really believes he is best for this Municipality and takes whatever his mits can grab! A taker, not a giver. You are the pawns.""

225The article continued as follows:

""The Meeting gallery has to sit through Megna's appalling 'thank you' speech, something that should have been taped for delivery to every ratepayer with their next garbage advices. A shocker. It spewed politics, a sewerage delivery upon the Labor Party councillors, backhanders for John Murphy's Council resignation and his own character, same for John Murray, and, of course, indication that the forthcoming Council By-Election cost would restrict Council's ability to provide ratepayers with those services we would expect to be normal.

Now how did we know that would be used as a Council excuse to avoid doing things in this Municipality! A greasy address indeed, full of self opinionated interests. You know - 'I am the greatest' type stuff. What did this all have to do with Megna's job for this community? Zero, and the gallery had to sit through the lot! Putrid! Listen Megna, if things were attended to properly in this district and you did your job, without the lies and inefficiencies, this Association wouldn't need to exist.

Drummoyne Council is now split up and down. Labor Councillors wanted the Mayor's job this time round, in terms of arrangements and precedent. Megna, with his Liberal mates (and therefore voting majority), seized upon the opportunity for public profile in his run-up to the next State Govt. elections in March 1999. Feelings between the factions are filthy. All of this muck, and we, the community, is expected to pay their wages and put up with it. What an insufferable lot!""

226The imputations conveyed by this item were:

""● 12(a): that as Mayor of the Council Mr Megna is motivated primarily by personal greed;

● 12(b): that as Mayor of the Council Mr Megna lies routinely to the ratepayers.""

227Her Honour, at [327], considered that it was difficult to discern any subject matter upon which any information was, or was purported to be, communicated. Her Honour considered that the item referred only to Mr Megna without any factual underpinning which could give it the colour of the communication of information. In this regard, her Honour considered that the item resembled the publication referred to in Motyka v Gojan [2007] NSWSC 31. Her Honour's intended reference was to Motyka, at [192], where James J considered that the matter complained of with which he was dealing conveyed:

""... very little factual information and is almost entirely devoted to accusing Dr Motyka of being a dishonest, shameful person, of being a devil, of poking his nose into everything, of denigrating everyone, treating everyone as idiots and breaking up organisations, doing the devil's work, being a pillager-savage, terrorising persons, telling lies, perpetrating evil and injustice and persecuting others.""

228The reference to the ""arrangements and precedent"", whereby the Labor Councillors wanted the position of Mayor, related to a convention, of which Mr Megna gave evidence, that the mayoralty alternated between the two parties because the Council was routinely evenly divided in numbers of Liberal and Labor Councillors. Notwithstanding these references to matters that were occurring within the Council, her Honour held, at [330], that the item was devoid of any information or expression of opinion so as to qualify for an occasion of qualified privilege. Her Honour further held, at [332], that even if the item was published on an occasion of qualified privilege, the passage upon which the imputations were based had no relevance to the occasion. Rather, they merely constituted an attack upon Mr Megna, his integrity and his ego. 

229Imputations 12(c) and 12(d) also arose out of the series of articles commencing in September 1998. There were three items, each published on a separate occasion and entitled ""COUNCILLOR'S DOMESTIC DISPUTE"". The first appeared in the September 1998 circular, in the following terms:

""Out of the 'blue' at the above meeting, Cr. Marshall queried a legal fee to Council of a little under $600, appearing on a recent list of Council's Vouchers (cheques). Simple query? Turns out to be a fee due to Council's solicitors, not for Council business, but relating to a domestic dispute between Cr. [M] and her neighbour of many years. Nothing to do with Council. We understood the matter has been listed in the Local Court to resolve. No worries though, Council will pay, i.e. you will pay. Not bad if you can get away with it. But hang on, there must be more to it, mustn't there? We'll wait for Council's explanation at the next meeting. It should be a ripper as we now have the neighbour's story."" (original emphasis) 

230Although this item was not sued upon, the appellants submitted that her Honour had regard to it in respect of the following two items, the first contained in the October 1998 circular and the second contained the December/January 1999 circular.

231The matter complained of in the October 1998 circular, being the sixth matter sued upon, was in the following terms:

""COUNCILLOR""S DOMESTIC DISPUTE:

In our September Circular, we raised the matter of a domestic dispute between Cr. [M] and her neighbour. Item 1 of Ordinary Council Meeting on 15/9/98, raised by Cr. Marshall, proposed 'that legal action commenced in Burwood Court, in relation to the neighbour, be discontinued'. Council's solicitor advised the meeting (according to Lloyd on the business paper) that 'the Court proceedings cannot be discontinued.' But, this Association asks, why not? Of course it can, at any time. Council is really after this ratepayer. Anyone with Court experience will know the Court can discontinue upon request.

So what's the story? Why are you, the ratepayers, paying for a Councillor's domestic dispute? We never found out! Cr. Marshall stood at the meeting to raise issues. A verbal slanging match then ensued between he [Mr Marshall] and Megna. Marshall merely wanted the matter publicly discussed. We certainly want to know the Council's view. We already know the neighbour's.

Cr. Marshall had gone to the trouble of obtaining a document from the neighbour's solicitor, and commenced to advise the meeting of its contents, Lloyd, (sitting next to Megna as usual at all meetings for prompting purposes), immediately had a heart attack. The body language was acrobatic, it was fantastic to watch. The smirk turned to dismay. The gallery heard his whispered gulping plea to Megna: 'rule him out of order'! Megna dutifully responded, 'you're out of order, Cr Marshall, sit down, sit down, you're out of order'. Megna then hastily moved to Item 2 without breath. Lloyd was left chewing his pencil end fervorently, sweat forming. We still await the Council's explanation. That will come, even if we have to obtain a Court extract in the end. Council cannot stop that. Real juicy stuff, you'll get the answer soon."" 

232The imputations arising out of this item were:

""● 12(c): that as Mayor of the Council Mr Megna acted jointly with Mr Lloyd to prevent ratepayers discovering the truth about a court case taken by the Council;

● 12(d): that as General Manager of the Council Mr Lloyd acted jointly with Mr Megna to prevent ratepayers discovering the truth about a court case taken by the Council.""

233Her Honour, at [337], stated that it was impossible, from a mere reading of the article, to discern the subject matter upon which this item purported to give information. Rather, as her Honour saw it, the item read as an attack upon each of the respondents. Her Honour accepted that if the subject matter in this item related to the Council's conduct in pursuing a complaint against one of its residents, in circumstances where the person making the complaint was a member of Council and a close personal and political associate of Mr Megna, it would have been sufficient for the purposes of a defence of qualified privilege. However, her Honour held, at [342], that the item did not purport to give any such information relating to that matter. Rather, her Honour observed, at [342], that the item asked questions and levelled abuse at the respondents. In her Honour's opinion, ""[o]n no level could [the item] be construed as communicating information to interested residents or ratepayers"". For that reason, her Honour, at [343], considered that the defence of qualified privilege failed ""at the first hurdle"".

234The matter complained of in the December/January 1999 circular, being the seventh matter complained of, was in the following terms:

""COUNCILLOR'S DOMESTIC DISPUTE:

Remember this domestic dispute between Cr. [M] and her neighbours of 20 years? As we reported in our Sept and Oct. Circulars, it was supposed to be over a noisy swimming pool pump/filter. Well, not really. [M] just doesn't like the bloke. Noise readings for this pump were not available to the Court (fact is, they didn't exist - unsatisfactory ones that is), prior to or during the Court hearings, and the pump had been there for 15 years with no previous complaints. The pump noise was merely an excuse.

Not to worry, [M] is pretty chummy with forgetful Megna. And he's the mayor. And they are both Liberal. So between them they got the Council involved and Council issued a Summons on the neighbours. Dogs? Nah, that's the system. The Council took on the neighbours, not McIntyre, as should have occurred.

The story gets better. Cr. Marshall (DMRA) at the council meeting on 15/9/98, asked why Council was involved. Lloyd told Megna to rule him 'out of order', and Megna did. Chummy? They blocked Marshall. It should be noted that the business paper for that meeting (Item 1), in a 'Note from the Gen. Man.', stated 'the Court proceedings cannot be discontinued' (they really had it in for this neighbour). This was, of course, absolute bull!!

Well, at the Court, the Council's solicitor was made aware of the contents of Lloyd's business paper statements of 15/9/98. The solicitor exploded, denying ever having advised Lloyd of matters which were printed in that Paper. Trouble was that this solicitor's denial was made in the presence of the neighbours' barrister!!! In other words, at that very moment, it was evident Lloyd had lied in the business paper! That also means he lied to you, the ratepayers, members of the gallery and his own Councillors. The Paper is meant to be a truthful account of Council's position in everything which is discussed at meetings.

For those who are critical of our Circulars, who dismiss it as rubbish, who can't believe the truth when it's amplified as a neon sign before your very eyes, and who say such things and then don't attend any Council meetings whatsoever, why don't you do something about this? What would you prefer, for us, as co-residents, to also ignore the suppose 'rubbish', not to lift a finger to do something about things like this, to hide it from public knowledge? Get real! The neighbour was going to be left to rot. He would have had to pay thousands for a Lloyd like! The bludger!

At least, Cr Tsirekas, after we brought the matter to public attention, rose to the occasion at the November monthly meeting. He surprisingly questioned Lloyd as to why this situation occurred, who was responsible, and what will be the cost to Council, and, therefore you, the ratepayer. At last, is Angelo rising to the potential we thought did exist? C'mon mate, get the answers, please. We'll then reinstate you to a councillor with some guts, a great chance for you. December's meeting saw Lloyd's absence. The same question was posed to Council's David Furlong. He advised answers to Councillor's question would be sent to the Councillor who asked the question, i.e. no one else will be told, no other councillor, nor member of the Public. The fleas will run berserk! Doesn't matter, we'll get the whole truth and publise it! You need to know just what this grubby matter has cost you as a ratepayer. 

This is a story to amplify the grubs we have on our Council, and reasons for our continual criticism. God knows how many other matters slip through without our knowledge. It could have cost the neighbour thousands. Instead, it will cost you. We have a liar as our general manager, as deliberate a lie as the day is long. It took the Magistrate 1 minute to dismiss the proceedings as a joke! And Councillors (all except one) voted for renewal of Lloyd's contract for 5 years in September. His salary, $113,040 p.a. plus, plus, plus!!! The Court awarded all costs to be paid by the Council, naturally!! A shocking story!"" (original emphasis) 

235The following imputations arose from this item:

""● 14(a): that as Mayor of the Council Mr Megna committed Council resources to supporting another Councillor in a private dispute with a neighbour because he was a crony of that other Councillor;

● 14(d): that as General Manager of the Council Mr Lloyd lied to the Council and ratepayers;

● 14(e): that as General Manager of the Council Mr Lloyd acted jointly with Mr Megna to prevent the public finding out that there was no proper basis for legal action begun by the Council."" 

236Her Honour, at [352], held that these imputations were not published on an occasion of qualified privilege. Her Honour accepted that the subject matter of the article in relation to the complaints, Council's handling of the matters and the conduct of the respondents in relation to those matters were all subject matters of legitimate concern to ratepayers. However, her Honour held that the item could not be construed as conveying information in relation to any of those subject matters. Rather, each was ""a mere diatribe from which no sensible information can be derived"". Accordingly, the imputations were not published on an occasion of qualified privilege. 

237Her Honour approached the matter complained of giving rise to imputations 14(b) and 14(c) in the same way. That is, as on her Honour's assessment, because no information on Council matters was conveyed by that part of the item that gave rise to the imputation or imputations, there was no occasion of qualified privilege. 

238If there is a category of qualified privilege arising out of the category of legitimate public interest per se, the sixth and seventh matters complained of fell into that category and there was sufficient connection in the defamatory comments made of the respondents to those occasions. However, for the reasons already given, I do not consider there is any such separate category. 

239The ninth matter complained of arose out of the circular of March 1999 and included an item headed ""LIES AND MORE LIES, KEEP 'EM COMING"":

""You'd think Megna would quietly shrink away into oblivion. Doesn't he get the message? He gave his State Parliament aspirations the flick by not standing for the Liberal Party candidature for the forthcoming State Elections (or did the Liberals finally produce the axe for his abyssmal by-election showing) and he's about as on the nose in his Council duties as could possibly be. Nope. There he is, slap bang on the front page of the Dist. News issue dated 23/2/99, clothed in glorious colour, in the middle of Five Dock shopping centre.

The article heading? 'Megna ready for the Boom, Development Applications Flooding In.' As you know, Megna and his Liberal mates had sufficient voting numbers on Council for success in having shopping centre floor space ratios slightly increased, ever so slightly. The believed this was sufficient to attract investors/developers into the centres to allow re-development and introduction of the much-needed new facilities.""

240This article gave rise to imputation 18(a) as follows:

""... that as Mayor of the Council Mr Megna is a liar.""

241Her Honour's finding, at [415]-[416], in respect of the ninth matter complained of giving rise to imputation 18(a) was that the item did not ""purport to communicate information"", but rather was the expression of the author's ""trenchant opinion"" as to Mr Megna's parliamentary ambitions and of Mr Megna personally. Her Honour considered that the balance of the item repeated criticisms of Mr Megna's stance in relation to floor space ratios, suggesting that the slight increase allowed would be insufficient to attract investors to the area. Her Honour further held that the heading to the item, ""LIES AND MORE LIES, KEEP 'EM COMING"", from which the imputation derived, was not relevant to that subject matter. For both reasons, her Honour considered that the defence of qualified privilege failed. Her Honour considered, at [417], that even if it could reasonably be held that the article was published on an occasion of qualified privilege, the heading was not relevant to those issues. 

242The assessment made by her Honour was clearly open. The article questioned whether the floor space ratio introduced in the amended Local Environmental Plan would be sufficient to introduce investment into the municipality. Whilst the effect of the article was to suggest that it was unlikely that would be the case, it is apparent from the article as a whole, that the author did not know whether or not a large number of development applications were being lodged. There are a number of statements in the authorities that an occasion of qualified privilege is not to be an occasion of abuse. Although a wrong or inaccurate statement will not destroy the privilege, it could not necessarily be said that readers of this item had an interest in being informed of material that was inherently speculative, so as to protect a blatant defamation on the basis that the matter complained of was published on an occasion of qualified privilege. 

243The appellants separately challenged the item in the twelfth matter complained of being the circular of September 1999 in which the following item headed ""COUNCIL AMALGAMATION"" appeared. As her Honour observed, the article was lengthy and I will only refer to the relevant portions. Accordingly, I will refer only to those portions to which her Honour referred in her judgment. 

""Welcome to the ratepayers of Concord Municipality. For the first time, you receive a copy of this Circular as a result of Concord ... and Drummoyne ... Councils' decision, without any discussion or public input whatsoever, to proceed 'to pursue discussion on amalgamation.' The process is nothing but fraud, but is given legitimacy by Harry Woods, State Minister for Local Government. Guess what? Our month-long initial investigation into 'Concord', its Mayor and Councillors, throws up just as much of the same muck as that in 'Drummoyne'. We look forward to publishing most of it in the forthcoming months prior to the next election, to show you just what incompetents decide Local Government policy in both areas and what they do with your money. 'Drummoyne' had Mayor Megna, (until Sept. 8th), a proven and continuous public liar, Lloyd (general manager) the same, and a group of ineffective and politically controlled Liberal and Labor Councillors ...

To the amalgamation! ... the Carr Labor Government ... has taken away local democracy from you and given both Councils the opportunity to amalgamate ...

... Amalgamation is nothing more than a blatant attempt by the Carr Govt. to seize a gigantic slab of power over local individuals, to take away those individual's right to local democracy, their one source of available input as 'grass root' level, and dilute it into a smaller number of far larger Councils throughout this State. That's control. That's what this is about. And the Liberals? They want it TOO! Here we have a Liberal Mayor 'crawling' to his political opposition superiors at a State level, without backbone, absolutely aware of the negative attitude of Drummoyne Municipality residents toward this sham ...

For good riddance, these Councillors voted on your behalf, without consultation, to cancel the Council elections in Sept., the only time in 4 years in which you are able to deal with inept Councillors. You also had your Constitutional Referendum decision of 1998, to vote for a new Mayor scrubbed. They call that democracy? And who paid to that Drummoyne Referendum back in Nov. '98? Of Course, YOU DID! The mug resident! More Council waste ...

... In fact, both Councils' staff have already been told that there will be no staff redundancies. Based upon Megna's feeble record, how could we believe anything he says about anything?"" (original emphasis)

244This item conveyed the following imputations:

""● 24(a): that as Mayor of the Council Mr Megna is a continuous public liar;

● 24(b): that Mr Megna is dishonest in his public office as Mayor of the Council;

● 24(c): that as Mayor of the Council Mr Megna lacks credibility;

● 24(d): that as Mayor of the Council Mr Megna practices deceit at every Council meeting;

● 24(e): that as General Manager of the Council Mr Lloyd is a proven continuous public liar; 

● 24(f): that as General Manager of the Council Mr Lloyd is dishonest.""

245The trial judge considered, at [468], in respect of imputations 24(a) and 24(e), that there was ""no semblance of communication of information on a matter relevant to recipients"". Accordingly, the imputations were not published on an occasion of qualified privilege. Her Honour added that there was nothing in the content of the publication that was relevant to any such occasion.

246Her Honour next dealt with imputations 24(b) and 24(f), noting that those imputations derived from the passage concerning the deferral of elections. Her Honour considered, at [469], that those imputations were not published on an occasion of qualified privilege, and were not relevant to any such occasion.

247Her Honour, in respect of imputation 24(c), held, at [470]-[471], that the imputation, which derived from the reference in the item to Mr Megna's ""feeble record"" followed by the query ""how could we believe anything he says about anything?"", was an attack upon Mr Megna, notwithstanding that the item purported to communicate information on the subject of the Council amalgamation.

248In my opinion, there was sufficient connection between the defamatory imputations and the subject matter of the item. 

249The appellants next challenged her Honour's findings in respect of the twelfth, thirteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth matters complained of, being publications under the following respective headings: ""LIAR, LIAR, LIAR LIES AGAIN"" (the twelfth matter complained of); ""$5,000 REWARD"" (the thirteenth matter complained of); ""WHY?"" (the fifteenth matter complained of); and ""RECENT COURT CASE - MEGNA AND MARSHALL"" (the sixteenth matter complained of). The appellants contended these matters concerned a continuing public dispute between Mr Marshall and Mr Megna. The trial judge rejected the appellants' argument that there was a relevant interest in the subject matter. It will be convenient to deal with these matters together.

250Although the appellants submitted that these items should be considered together, it is preferable to first consider the twelfth and thirteenth matters complained of, as her Honour's finding in respect of each was that there was no foundation laid for proving the truth of the matters alleged. 

251The item in the twelfth matter complained of, presently under consideration, was: 

""LIAR, LIAR, LIAR LIES AGAIN:

Back to Megna. As you may recall, and for the benefit of Concord residents, we released the story of Megna's delivery of criminally defamatory circulars on the evening of 27th May in Abbotsford, Chiswick and Drummoyne Unit areas. The circulars were a direct copy of this Ratepayers' Circular, but defaming many in the Drummoyne Municipality, including local Labor State Member for Drummoyne, John Murray. Megna's circular was written by Cr [L], and was a 'payback' for information released over 18 months of publication in Our Ratepayers' Circular. [L] assisted its delivery.

Megna was apprehended by 2 Drummoyne Councillors and 2 residents in a back street of Abbotsford. A Police Report is now held by our members, and it confirms the witnessing of the delivered circulars by a police officer. Tabled and public fact! Well, like the liar he is, 2 weeks later, Megna issued his own personal letter, signed by him, advising, 'I strenuously deny all the accusations made against myself by the above Senior Citizens Club and the above Ratepayers' Association ... the claims made by both these organisations are highly defamatory, devoid of any truth and totally lacking in evidence.'

Megna even denied the matter to his own Rotary Colleagues, and to his own Liberal Party members, But the Police were called whilst Megna was being detained by the 4 apprehenders (recorded fact), and the report clearly confirms results of the Police investigation. Not bad for one who is a Mayor. As we have been saying for 18 months, Megna is a liar, and you should visit Council meetings if only to witness the mouthful of deceit spewed out each time. We are sure he doesn't even know when he is and isn't lying. 

At the time of writing, Drummoyne and Five Dock shopping centres have been the subject locations for many stickers in prominent positions. They say: 'Mayor of Drummoyne Megna is a liar'. It would appear others, apart from our Association members, are upset with him. This Association is not responsible for these stickers. One apprehending Councillor and Cr Tserakis (Labor) have continually asked for debate on the Mayor's apprehension. Megna and Lloyd block any debate, advising 'it is a private matter'. It may well be. But hang on, if so, why are Council employees (CanBay) and not Megna himself being used to remove the stickers which are replaced a couple of days later. What is the cost to ratepayers? We have the feeling the stickers matter will become a lot more stickier yet!"" (original emphases) 

252This article was held to convey imputa",2013-02-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2761025,"AYACHE, Baiyan v R [2013] NSWCCA 41","Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Rothman J.

2ROTHMAN J: The applicant, Baiyan Ayache, seeks leave to appeal a sentence imposed by the District Court on 18 November 2011. If leave were granted, the applicant appeals the sentence imposed on the same grounds as that upon which the applicant relies for the grant of leave.

3The applicant pleaded guilty to the supply of a prohibited drug (249.9 grams of methylamphetamine) in contravention of s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1986. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 15 years' imprisonment. The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 5 years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 15 October 2011.

4There was one offence notified on a Form 1, being possession of prohibited drug (6.7 grams cannabis leaf).

5Two grounds of appeal are raised:

(1)His Honour erred in not holding that the applicant was entitled to a discount of 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea;

(2)The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

Circumstances of the offence

6A search warrant was executed on the applicant's home at Merrylands on 3 November 2010 as well as the applicant's business in Greystanes.

7During the search, a number of small resealable plastic bags were discovered at the applicant's home, containing cannabis leaves and methylamphetamine. There were also Tupperware containers in the freezer containing methylamphetamine.

8When the police conducted the search at Greystanes, the applicant took them through the premises, during the course of which he said to the police: ""I'll just give it to you"", whereupon the applicant retrieved the Tupperware container from a cupboard. He then identified the contents of the container as: ""Scales and speed"". A large amount of resealable bags were also obtained from the shop.

9After being taken to the Police Station and being informed that he was to be subject to a strip-search, the applicant retrieved two Tupperware containers from inside his pants, containing green and pink pills. The police asked the applicant what they were and the applicant said they were ""Speed Balls"". The applicant told the police that he had placed the drugs in his pants when he saw the police in his shop.

10The total amount of drugs found in the possession of the applicant was 0.1 grams below the commercial quantity (i.e. 249.9 grams of methylamphetamine).

11The applicant entered a plea of guilty at the first available opportunity on 20 July 2011, when the matter was called in the Local Court. He confirmed that plea in the District Court, when the matter came before it, namely 18 November 2011.

Ground 1: Entitlement to a discount of 25 per cent

12It is accepted by both parties, as it must be, that the applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. The sentencing judge accepted that proposition. The sentencing judge, relevantly, said:

""The Court reduced his sentence by about 25 per cent to reflect the utility of his early guilty plea. The Court is satisfied on the material before it that the conditions referred to in subpara 21A(3)(i) have been met and that he is remorseful and, accordingly, the sentence was reduced further to reflect that remorse. (ROS, 1)

...

The combination of circumstances of this case satisfies the Court beyond a reasonable doubt that the Offender was involved in supplying drugs to users himself or to a wholesaler who would then on-sell them to people who would use them. In terms of the distribution chain before an actual user, therefore the Offender was either on the lowest or second-lowest rung of the drug trafficking hierarchy.

Although an isolated aberration, the amount of drug, the form in which it took and the fact that it was distributed between three locations indicates, in the Court's view, that he was involved in drug trafficking to a substantial degree. The Court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence was premeditated and that he must have appreciated that he was enmeshing himself in organisation [sic] criminal activity. The fact that this was not for greed but rather to provide drugs for his own usage, that it developed in the context previously noted is a matter that is borne in mind.

The evidence before the Court satisfies it that his prospects of rehabilitation and not re-offending are very good."" (ROS, 12-13)

13The gravamen of the submission on this ground is that the use, by the sentencing judge, of the expression ""about 25 per cent"" (ROS, 1) indicates that his Honour allowed a discount of less than 25 per cent and not the full 25 per cent and in so doing his Honour fell into error. The applicant submits that there is ""no explanation as to why the discount fell below the highest end of the range"".

14In my opinion, this submission is wholly without merit. Sentencing is a process of intuitive synthesis. It is not a mathematical exercise. The discount for a plea of guilty was dealt with in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [152], Spigelman CJ said:

""In my opinion, the appropriate range for a discount is from 10-25 percent.""

In the conclusion, the Chief Justice (with whom the remainder of the Court, Wood CJ at CL, Foster AJA, Grove and James JJ, agreed), at [160], relevantly said:

""(ii) Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant - contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value - but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last mentioned matter. Where other matters are regarded as appropriate to be quantified in a particular case, e.g. assistance to authorities, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate. 

(iii) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 percent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge."" (Emphasis added.)

15There is nothing in the remarks on sentence of the sentencing judge to suggest that the term ""about 25 per cent"" was less than 25 per cent. It may well have been more than 25 per cent. Far more importantly, the proposition that there must be mathematical precision of the kind for which the applicant contends cannot be supported.

16The maximum sentence available to be imposed was 25 years' imprisonment. The sentencing judge allowed a discount of about 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea and allowed a further reduction (there being no complaint as to two stage sentencing) for remorse.

17The reduction for remorse was not quantified. Nor should it have been.

18As earlier stated, the process of sentencing is intuitive. The sentencing judge was entitled to describe the discount at the highest end of the range as ""about 25 per cent"" when it was being applied in circumstances where other matters were being taken into account which required a reduction in what might otherwise have been an appropriate sentence. The alternative would be to encourage sentencing judges to impose sentences, which include years, months and days, a practice which has been uniformly deprecated. This ground of appeal fails. 

Ground 2: Manifest excess

19The applicant submits that in light of the applicant's compelling subjective case, the sentence is manifestly excessive. The sentencing judge found that the applicant had a compelling subjective case and listed numerous positive findings as to the subjective circumstances of the applicant. In addition to those matters, the applicant submits that the sentence was manifestly excessive because insufficient attention was paid to the low purity of the drug and the applicant's limited role in supply: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2006) 228 CLR 357.

20The applicant also submits that, when compared with the sentencing statistics for this offence, the sentence was outside the range available.

21His Honour, the sentencing judge, referred to the statistics on sentencing. Further, the sentencing judge referred to a number of judgments and the circumstances associated with sentences imposed for similar or the same offences. His Honour summarised a number of those, at length, in the course of arriving at the sentence to be imposed.

22Moreover, the sentencing judge made specific and detailed reference to the purity of the drug and the fact that it had been cut to a significant degree by the addition of sugar. Plainly, the sentencing judge also took into account the nature of the applicant's drug addiction and its short term rather than chronic nature and the positive aspects of his attitude to life in fixing a non-parole period of 2 years in a head sentence of 5 years.

23As this Court said in Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33]:

""To establish that a sentence is manifestly excessive an applicant has to demonstrate that the sentence was 'unreasonable or plainly unjust' (Dinsdale [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325). This has to be established in a context where there is no single correct sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle. Most pertinently the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it may have exercised its discretion in a manner different from that of the sentencing judge. (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 at [26] - [28])."" (Per Hoeben J (with whom Tobias JA and James J agreed).)

24In my view the sentence imposed on the applicant was within range and is not manifestly excessive. The sentencing judge has made no error. I would propose that the Court make the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted;

(2)Appeal dismissed.

25ADAMSON J: I agree with Rothman J.

2761044,R v Karimi; R v Khoury; R v Mir (No. 1) [2013] NSWSC 156,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: By Notice of Motion filed 27 February 2013, the Accused, Mohammad Jawad Karimi (""Karimi""), makes application for severance of four counts from the indictment and seeks a separate trial with respect to those four counts.

2An amended indictment presented on 28 February 2013 charges Karimi and others with the following offences:

(a) Count 1 - John Khoury (""Khoury"") and Karimi - on 29 June 2010 at Villawood, conspiring amongst themselves and others to rob Ernesto Bertolli whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, a shortened firearm.

(b) Count 2 - Khoury and Karimi - on 29 June 2010 at Ashcroft, breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a serious indictable offence therein, larceny of a laptop computer and a plastic container, in circumstances of special aggravation, namely at the time of the offence, wounding James Stiff.

(c) Count 3 - In the alternative to Count 2 - Khoury and Karimi - on 29 June 2010 at Ashcroft, being armed with an offensive weapon, a machete, robbing James Stiff of a laptop computer and a plastic container and, at the time of the offence, wounding James Stiff.

(d) Count 4 - Khoury only - on 1 July 2010 at Chester Hill, recruiting Tomasi Natuba to carry out a criminal activity, namely robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon.

(e) Count 5 - Khoury, Karimi and Mahdi Mir (""Mir"") - on 1 July 2010 at Warwick Farm, being armed with an offensive weapon, a meat cleaver, robbing Maxine Rogers of a mobile phone and laptop computer.

(f) Count 6 - Khoury, Karimi and Mir - on or about 1 July 2010 at Lurnea, murdering Kesley Burgess.

(g) Count 7 - in the alternative to Count 6 with respect to Khoury only - on or about 3 July 2010, knowing the persons to have committed the murder of Kesley Burgess, receiving, harbouring, maintaining and assisting those persons known to him.

(h) Count 8 - Khoury, Karimi and Mir - on 1 July 2010 at Lurnea, being armed with an offensive weapon, a meat cleaver, robbing Tracey Burgess of a handbag.

(i) Count 9 - Khoury and Karimi - on or about 3 July 2010, conspiring amongst themselves and other persons to murder an unknown person.

(j) Count 10 - in the alternative to Count 9 with respect to Karimi only - on 4 July 2010 at Miller, while in company of other persons, possessing an offensive weapon, a shortened .22 calibre long rifle, with intent to commit an indictable offence, affray.

(k) Count 11 - Karimi only - on 4 July 2010 at Miller, possessing a firearm, a shortened .22 calibre long rifle, without being authorised to do so by a licence or permit.

(l) Count 12 - Khoury only - between 29 June 2010 and 4 July 2010 at Villawood, possessing a firearm, a shortened .22 calibre long rifle, without being authorised to do so by a licence of permit.

3The severance application made by counsel for Karimi relates to Counts 1, 9, 10 and 11. No severance or separate trial application has been made by the co-accused, Khoury and Mir.

4Mr Wasilenia, counsel for Karimi, accepted that it was the Crown's prerogative to present an indictment where a number of offences have been alleged to have been committed by two or more accused if the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character. He emphasised that this is subject to a Judge's discretion to order that the proceedings not be heard together under s.29(3) Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

Section 29 Criminal Procedure Act 1986

5Section 29 is in the following terms:

""29 When more than one offence may be heard at the same time

(1) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to 2 or more offences alleged to have been committed by the same accused person in any of the following circumstances:

(a) the accused person and the prosecutor consent,

(b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances,

(c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character.

(2) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to offences alleged to have been committed by 2 or more accused persons in any of the following circumstances:

(a) the accused persons and the prosecutor consent,

(b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances,

(c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character.

(3) Proceedings related to 2 or more offences or 2 or more accused persons may not be heard together if the court is of the opinion that the matters ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice.""

6It is important to bear in mind that the interests of justice in s.29(3) involve more than the interests of an accused person, and that the interests of the Crown, the witnesses and the public must also be considered: Osman v R [2006] NSWCCA 196 at [22].

7Submissions were directed to the terms of s.29(1)(b) and (c) and the discretionary provision contained in s.29(3) of the Act.

8The Crown submitted that the offences charged against Karimi arise out of the same set of circumstances or that they form, or are part of, a series of offences of the same or a similar character.

9In support of the application, Mr Wasilenia sought to contrast aspects of Counts 1, 9, 10 and 11 with other counts in the amended indictment. He submitted, in any event, that the Court should be of the opinion that Counts 1, 9, 10 and 11 ought be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice. 

The Crown Case

10Submissions were made by reference to the Crown Case Statement dated 1 August 2012. 

11It is the Crown case that the Accused Khoury planned to shut down drug dealers within the Liverpool, Warwick Farm and Villawood areas by committing home invasions to take their drugs. For this purpose, the Crown alleges that associates of Khoury (including Karimi) were involved in these activities, together with other persons who were recruited for that purpose. The Accused Mir is alleged to have become involved in these criminal activities on 1 July 2010. 

12Counts 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 relate directly to the carrying out of home invasions for the purpose of obtaining drugs and money.

13With respect to Count 1, the Crown alleges that Khoury and Karimi and others conspired to commit an armed robbery by way of a home invasion for the purpose of obtaining a firearm desired by Khoury. To this end, the Crown alleges that a number of persons who were involved in the later home invasions entered premises at Lakemba, although not succeeding in obtaining the relevant firearm. 

14Counts 9, 10 and 11 are not alleged by the Crown to involve a home invasion. Rather, the Crown alleges that some members of the same group who had planned or undertaken home invasions became involved in a proposed confrontation with persons. Count 9 is an allegation that Khoury, Karimi and others conspired to murder an unknown person in this context. 

15Evidence to be adduced by the Crown in support of Counts 9, 10 and 11 includes telephone intercept evidence, and evidence of persons said to have been involved in this activity, including Anaterea Tamapua (""Tamapua""). The Crown alleges that telephone intercepts record Karimi and Khoury planning such a confrontation with mention made in recorded conversations (involving Karimi) that firearms and ""choppers"" were required.

16It is the Crown case that on 4 July 2010, within hours of these conversations, police stopped a Ford Laser vehicle at Miller in which four persons, including Karimi and Tamapua, were seated. Karimi was seated in the rear of the vehicle next to Richard Vergara (""Vergara""). The Crown alleges that a search of the vehicle revealed a black-handled machete in the rear offside foot well where Vergara was seated, together with a purple bag containing a shortened .22 calibre long rifle, which was loaded and in working order with one round of ammunition in the breach, on the rear seat between Karimi and Vergara.

17The Crown anticipates that Tamapua will give evidence that the machete was the one used by Vergara to wound James Stiff in the Ashcroft offences (Counts 2 and 3) and the firearm had been stored at the Villawood compound where Khoury lived. Tamapua also states that Karimi had told him that he had already loaded the firearm.

18The Crown contends that the machete is consistent with the weapon described by members of the Stiff family as being used against them in the Ashcroft offences. Further, and importantly, subsequent analysis of the stained area on the tip of the blade of the machete identified a partial DNA profile from blood that matches the DNA profile of James Stiff. 

19The shortened .22 calibre long rifle was subsequently analysed. DNA was recovered from the trigger area of the firearm that originates from at least two individuals. The Crown alleges that Khoury has the same profile as the major component of the DNA mixture.

20Also located in Karimi's clothing following the stopping of the Ford Laser vehicle was a mobile phone used in various conversations which had been intercepted on 3 and 4 July 2010. 

Submissions on Application

21Written submissions were furnished by counsel for Karimi and the Crown for the purpose of this application. Those submissions are on file and it is not necessary to recite them in detail in this judgment.

22Put shortly, Mr Wasilenia submitted that:

(a) the conspiracy charges contained in Counts 1 and 9 involved a different subject matter to the other charges (not being allegations of planned home invasions to obtain drugs or money);

(b) the nature of directions to be given to a jury with respect to the conspiracy charges in Counts 1 and 9 would be different to directions concerning other charges (involving joint criminal enterprise), so that complex and potentially confusing directions would be given to the jury with respect to the different classes of offences charged;

(c) whilst acknowledging that the location of the firearm and machete in the Ford Laser vehicle would be admissible in the trial for other counts (including Counts 2 and 3), this evidence could be adduced without Counts 9, 10 and 11 being joined, the latter course involving allegations of serious crimes against Karimi which were not otherwise related to the remaining charges;

(d) it was necessary to keep in mind the charge of murder contained in Count 6 which involves an allegation that Kesley Burgess was murdered by use of meat cleavers in the course of a home invasion, a scenario which it was submitted was likely to arouse hostility, strong emotions or excite revulsion;

(e) the Crown evidence in support of Counts 1, 9, 10 and 11 is not admissible with respect to the other counts - this was an attempt to adduce tendency or propensity evidence in circumstances where the Crown had not given notice of an intention to lead such evidence;

(f) substantial prejudice would result to Karimi if the trial proceeded upon all counts contained in the amended indictment.

23The Crown pointed to the interrelationship between the machete and firearm located in the Ford Laser vehicle and earlier offences, together with the conversations involving Karimi and others which preceded the stopping of the vehicle, which were capable of linking Karimi and others to these items and thus to other offences charged on the indictment. Likewise, the location of the mobile phone on Karimi provided an evidentiary link to relevant calls.

24The Crown submitted that the telephone intercepts concerning Counts 9, 10 and 11 were capable of establishing that Karimi was aware that the group had access to a firearm and other weapons and that members of the group were prepared to use the weapons. This was said to be relevant to the Crown demonstrating with respect to Counts 2 and 3, that Karimi contemplated the wounding of a person as a possible incident in the execution of the Ashcroft home invasion and, with respect to Count 6, the Crown establishing that Karimi contemplated infliction of grievous bodily harm to a person as a possible incident in the execution of the Lurnea home invasion.

25The Crown contended that these matters did not involve an attempt to rely upon tendency or propensity evidence. 

26With respect to Count 1, the Crown submitted that this involved a conspiracy to commit an armed home invasion involving the same personnel who carried out the Ashcroft home invasion later that evening, having available to them the .22 shortened firearm and machete later found in the Ford Laser vehicle with Karimi and others on 4 July 2010.

27The Crown submitted that the provisions in s.29(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 had been satisfied and that the Court should not form the opinion, for the purposes of s.29(3), that Counts 1, 9, 10 and 11 ought be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice.

Determination

28I am satisfied that Count 1 satisfies the requirements of s.29(1)(b) and (c) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. This count involves an alleged home invasion involving the same group of home invaders as participated in the Ashcroft offences alleged to have occurred later on 29 June 2010 (Counts 2 and 3). The fact that the suggested motive for this offence was to obtain a firearm, rather than drugs and money, does not materially affect the position. This was the first in a series of alleged offences which were of the same or a similar character.

29The fact that Count 1 involves a charge of conspiracy, and thus the need for directions relevant to that count, does not materially assist Karimi on this application. It will be for the Court to direct the jury in this respect. I am not of the opinion that Count 1 ought be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice.

30Counts 9, 10 and 11 do not involve allegations of planned or performed home invasions. However, on the Crown case, there are inextricable links between persons involved in other offences contained in the amended indictment and items utilised in those earlier offences. The Crown alleges that the .22 shortened firearm and machete located in the Ford Laser on 4 July 2010 were weapons available at the time of the offence contained in Count 1, and that the machete was utilised in the Ashcroft offences (contained in Counts 2 and 3). Telephone intercepts late on the evening of 3 July 2010 record Karimi discussing with others the provision of firearms and ""choppers"" in the hours before the stopping of the vehicle on 4 July 2010. 

31Counsel for Karimi concedes that evidence of the location of the .22 shortened firearm and the machete in the vehicle, in the presence of Karimi and others, would be admissible with respect to other counts in the amended indictment.

32In circumstances where, within a period of days, it is alleged that persons were involved in planned criminal activities involving the use of weapons, including the .22 shortened firearm and the machete, and that there are links between these persons and weapons, I am satisfied that it can be said that the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character. The linkage between persons and items and the readiness of members of the group, on the Crown case, to utilise these weapons are factors pertinent to this conclusion.

33I do not consider that the Crown case is appropriately characterised as involving an attempt to rely upon tendency or propensity evidence. On the Crown case, there are direct links between persons, items and offences. Further, the evidence concerning the .22 shortened firearm and machete and their availability and use at the times of Counts 2, 3 and 6, are capable of bearing upon the state of mind of Karimi with respect to those counts.

34I am satisfied that the requirements of s.29(1) have been met with respect to Counts 9, 10 and 11. I am not persuaded that the interests of justice require that these counts be heard and determined separately. The jury will be directed concerning the use of evidence adduced at the trial, by reference to the elements of the various offences charged in the amended indictment. I accept that the subject matter of Count 6 is capable of arousing strong emotions, however the jury will be given appropriate directions in that respect.

35In circumstances where, subject to any further area of objection, the evidence relevant to Counts 9, 10 and 11 will be before the jury for purposes which, in one way or another, relate to the proof of earlier counts, then the interests of justice will not be compromised by Karimi standing trial at the same time for the offences charged in Counts 9, 10 and 11.

36I refused the application to sever Counts 1, 9, 10 and 11 in respect of the Accused Karimi.

37The Notice of Motion is dismissed.

		04 October 2013",2013-03-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761045,R v Ross Edward Seller; R v Patrick David McCarthy [2013] NSWCCA 42,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: Each of the respondents Patrick David McCarthy (""Mr McCarthy"") and Ross Edward Seller (""Mr Seller"") were charged on indictment that between about 24 May 2001 and about 30 December 2002 they conspired with each other and various other persons with the intention of dishonestly influencing a Commonwealth public official, the Commissioner of Taxation, in the exercise of his duties as a public official contrary to s 135.4(7) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).

2By orders made on 17 August 2012, the primary judge permanently stayed proceedings on the indictment and ordered that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (""the CDPP"") pay the costs of Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy on the stay applications with certain limited exceptions (""the costs order"").

3The basis for the stay was that the disclosure by the Australian Crime Commission (""the ACC"") of certain transcripts of evidence given by Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy before the ACC compromised their right to a fair trial in accordance with ""the adversarial process"". The primary judge held it was not appropriate for a trial to go ahead in these circumstances because it would be ""an offence to the administration of justice"" (judgment at [258]-[259]).

4By Notice of Appeal dated 31 August 2012, the appellant appealed against the stay ordered by the primary judge and the costs order. The appeal was purportedly brought as of right under s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. No argument was addressed on the question as to whether the reference to the Director of Public Prosecutions in that subsection included the CDPP. However, as the questions raised are of general public importance it is appropriate that to the extent necessary leave should be granted.

The legislative background

5To understand the judgment of the primary judge, the issues raised on the appeal and the parties' submissions it is necessary to have regard to certain of the provisions of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) (""the Act"") and at least some of its legislative history.

6Section 7A of the Act sets out the functions of the ACC. Of particular relevance for present purposes are s 7A(a), (b) and (c) which provide that the ACC is:

""7A(a) to collect, correlate, analyse and disseminate criminal information and intelligence and to maintain a national database of that information and intelligence;

(b) to undertake, when authorised by the Board, intelligence operations;

(c) to investigate, when authorised by the Board, matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity"".

7Division 1A of Pt II of the Act deals with the performance of the functions and exercise of powers by the ACC. Section 12(1) provides as follows:

""12(1) Where the ACC, in carrying out an ACC operation/investigation, obtains evidence of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, being evidence that would be admissible in a prosecution for the offence, the CEO must assemble the evidence and give it to:

(a) the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or the State, as the case requires; or

(b) the relevant law enforcement agency; or

(c) any person or authority (other than a law enforcement agency) who is authorised by or under a law of the Commonwealth or of the State or Territory to prosecute the offence.""

8There are two things to note about this section. First, the obligation is limited to admissible evidence. Second, the obligation includes dissemination to relevant law enforcement agencies. The expression law enforcement agency is defined in s 4 of the Act as follows:

""law enforcement agency means:

(a) the Australian Federal Police;

(b) a Police Force of a State; or

(c) any other authority or person responsible for the enforcement of the laws of the Commonwealth or of the States.""

9The predecessor Act, the National Crime Authority Act 1984 (Cth) (""the NCA Act"") contained a similar definition of law enforcement agency. However, s 12(1) was in somewhat different terms. It provided as follows:

""12.(1) The Authority shall -

(a) in performing the functions referred to in paragraph 11(1)(b) and in sub-section 11(2), assemble any evidence of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory, or of an offence against a law of a State, that it obtains in the course of its investigations, being evidence that would be admissible in the prosecution of a person for that offence, and furnish that evidence to the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or of the State or to the relevant law enforcement agency; and

(b) in performing the function referred to in paragraph 11(1)(d), endeavour to ensure that any evidence of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory, or of an offence against a law of a State, that is obtained in the course of investigations of a kind referred to in that paragraph, being evidence that would be admissible in the prosecution of a person for that offence, is assembled and furnished to the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or of the State or to the relevant law enforcement agency.""

10However, that section was amended by the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act 1991 (Cth) which repealed the then existing s 12(1) and replaced it with a provision in substantially the same form as appears in the Act. The Explanatory Memorandum explained the amendment in the following terms:

""Schedule 2 amends subsection 12(1) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984. The amendment enables evidence collected by the NCA to be assembled and given to those authorised to prosecute Commonwealth, State or Territory offences. At present the evidence can only be given to the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or a State or a law enforcement agency. This change will streamline procedures which were originally designed for a prosecutions system which had the Attorney-General as the central authority. Now the Commonwealth, States and Northern Territory use a separate prosecuting authority. The amendment has been recommended by the Inter-Governmental Committee for the NCA. The Committee recommended similar amendments to State and Northern Territory legislation.""

11Division 2 of Pt II of the Act deals with examinations. Section 24A empowers an examiner to conduct an examination for the purpose of a special ACC operation/investigation. Such an operation/investigation is defined in s 4. There is no issue in the present case as to the power of the examiner in question to conduct the examinations which occurred. 

12Section 25A of the Act deals with the conduct of examination. Of particular relevance are s 25A(3), (9)-(11) which provide as follows:

""25A(3) An examination before an examiner must be held in private and the examiner may give directions as to the persons who may be present during the examination or a part of the examination.

...

(9) An examiner may direct that:

(a) any evidence given before the examiner; or

(b) the contents of any document, or a description of any thing, produced to the examiner; or

(c) any information that might enable a person who has given evidence before the examiner to be identified; or

(d) the fact that any person has given or may be about to give evidence at an examination;

must not be published, or must not be published except in such manner, and to such persons, as the examiner specifies. The examiner must give such a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been, or may be, charged with an offence.

(10) Subject to subsection (11), the CEO may, in writing, vary or revoke a direction under subsection (9).

(11) The CEO must not vary or revoke a direction if to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence.""

13Subsections 25A(1), (7), (8), (10), (11) and (15) did not appear in the equivalent provisions in the NCA Act. Subject to that, the equivalent provisions were in substantially the same form.

14Section 30 of the Act deals with the obligation to answer questions asked by an examiner. So far as relevant it provides as follows:

""30(2) A person appearing as a witness at an examination before an examiner shall not:

(a) when required pursuant to section 28 either to take an oath or make an affirmation - refuse or fail to comply with the requirement;

(b) refuse or fail to answer a question that he or she is required to answer by the examiner; or

(c) refuse or fail to produce a document or thing that he or she was required to produce by a summons under this Act served on him or her as prescribed.

...

(4) Subsection (5) limits the use that can be made of any answers given at an examination before an examiner, or documents or things produced at an examination before an examiner. That subsection only applies if:

(a) a person appearing as a witness at an examination before an examiner:

(i) answers a question that he or she is required to answer by the examiner; or

(ii) produces a document or thing that he or she was required to produce by a summons under this Act served on him or her as prescribed; and

(b) in the case of the production of a document that is, or forms part of, a record of an existing or past business - the document sets out details of earnings received by the person in respect of his or her employment and does not set out any other information; and

(c) before answering the question or producing the document or thing, the person claims that the answer, or the production of the document or thing, might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty.

(5) The answer, or the document or thing, is not admissible in evidence against the person in:

(a) a criminal proceeding; or

(b) a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty;

other than:

(c) confiscation proceedings; or

(d) a proceeding in respect of:

(i) in the case of an answer - the falsity of the answer; or

(ii) in the case of the production of a document - the falsity of any statement contained in the document.""

15The sections are to be contrasted with the corresponding provisions in the NCA Act which relevantly were in the following terms:

""30(2) A person appearing as a witness at a hearing before the Authority shall not, without reasonable excuse - 

(a) when required pursuant to section 28 either to take an oath or make an affirmation - refuse or fail to comply with the requirement;

(b) refuse or fail to answer a question that he is required to answer by the member or acting member presiding at the hearing; or

...

(4) Subject to sub-sections (5), (7) and (9), it is a reasonable excuse for the purposes of sub-section (2) for a natural person -

(a) to refuse or fail to answer a question put to him at a hearing before the Authority; or

(b) to refuse or fail to produce a document or thing that he was required to produce at a hearing before the Authority,

that the answer to the question, or the production of the document or thing, as the case may be, might tend to incriminate him.

(5) It is not a reasonable excuse for the purposes of sub-section (2) for a person -

(a) to refuse or fail to answer a question put to him at a hearing before the Authority; or

(b) to refuse or fail to produce a document or thing that he was required to produce at a hearing before the Authority, 

that the answer to the question or the production of the document or thing might tend to prove his guilt of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory if the Director of Public Prosecutions has given to the person an undertaking in writing that any answer given or document or thing produced, as the case may be, or any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the answer or the production of the first-mentioned document or thing, will not be used in evidence in any proceedings against him for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory other than proceedings in respect of the falsity of evidence given by the person and the Director of Public Prosecutions states in the undertaking -

(c) that, in his opinion, there are special grounds that in the public interest require that answers be given or documents or things be produced by that person; and

(d) the general nature of those grounds.""

16These sections relatively clearly provided an immunity from both direct self-incrimination and indirect or derivative self-incrimination. However, the National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Act 2001 (Cth) amended s 30(1)-(2) and repealed s 30(4)-(11) to insert provisions in substantially the same form as now appear in the Act. The Explanatory Memorandum stated the reason for the amendment in the following terms:

""Use immunity and self-incrimination

Proposed subsection 30(5) limits the use that can be made of certain evidence and applies if one of the situations set out in proposed subsection 30(4) exists. (Proposed subsection 30(4) re-enacts the existing circumstances in which a person may claim the privilege against self-incrimination.)

Proposed subsection 30(5) applies if:

before answering a question that the person is required to answer at a hearing before the Authority;

before producing, in answer to a summons, a document that sets out details of earnings received by the person in respect of his or her employment and does not set out any other information; or

before producing a thing in answer to a summons;

the person claims that the answer or the production of the document or thing might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty.

When proposed subsection 30(5) applies, the answer or the document or thing is not admissible in evidence against the person in a criminal proceeding or a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty other than in a proceeding in respect of the falsity of the answer or the falsity of any statement in the document, as the case may be.

Proposed subsection 30(5) will mean that, in the circumstances set out in proposed subsection 30(4), the answer, document or thing, cannot be used as evidence against the person, except in limited circumstances. However, contrary to the current position, any evidence that is derived from that answer, document or thing may be used against the person. The Authority is unique in nature and has a critical role in the fight against serious and organised crime. This means that the public interest in the Authority having full and effective investigatory powers, and to enable, in any subsequent court proceedings, the use against the person of incriminating material derived from the evidence given to the Authority, outweigh the merits of affording full protection to self-incriminatory material. The proposed provision is comparable to section 68 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989.""

17Finally, at the relevant time, s 59(7) and s 59(8) provided as follows:

""59(7) The CEO may give to:

(a) any law enforcement agency; or

(b) any foreign law enforcement agency; or

(c) any other agency or body of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory prescribed by the regulations;

any information that is in the ACC's possession and that is relevant to the activities of that agency or body if:

(d) it appears to the CEO to be appropriate to do so; and

(e) to do so would not be contrary to a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that would otherwise apply.

(8) The CEO may, whenever it appears to the CEO to be appropriate to do so, furnish to authorities and persons responsible for taking civil remedies by or on behalf of the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory any information that has come into the possession of the ACC and that may be relevant for the purposes of so taking such remedies in respect of matters connected with, or arising out of, offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory, as the case may be.""

Factual background

18The factual background to the application is summarised in the judgment of the primary judge. The primary facts are not controversial although a number of inferences drawn by the primary judge are disputed by the appellant.

19Mr McCarthy was examined by the ACC for four days over the period 14 May 2007 to 17 May 2007, on 30 July 2007 and on 12 and 13 September 2007. Mr Seller was examined on 31 July 2007, and on 13 and 14 September 2007. The summons served on each of them required them to give evidence on matters relevant to the offences for which they were ultimately charged.

20A Mr Quincy Tang, an officer of the Australian Tax Office (""ATO""), was seconded to the ACC and was present on some occasions during the examination of Mr McCarthy and on other occasions observed the examination from a separate room. His role was to provide financial analysis for the ACC in respect of the investigation into Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller. The primary judge found, and it was not disputed, that the evidence of Messrs McCarthy and Seller was of interest to him and relevant for him in cross-checking his analysis.

21Mr Tang left the ACC and returned to the ATO in 2009. It is proposed he give evidence on behalf of the Crown at the trial. The primary judge's findings in respect of Mr Tang were as follows:

""[27] Mr Tang has had access to the transcripts of examination of Mr McCarthy, although he may not have accessed all of them. He has been given access to transcripts of the examinations of all other witnesses examined by the Crime Commission. Although he could not recall with precision which transcripts of Mr McCarthy's examinations he had had access to, he was able to say that he had had access to such transcripts as he had requested. The same situation applies to the transcript of the examination of Mr Seller.

[28] I am satisfied that the reality is, with respect to Mr McCarthy and to Mr Seller, that Mr Tang attended or else observed and listened to most of the examinations conducted by the Crime Commission of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller. He had access to all of the transcripts of those examinations, and he had read some of those transcripts although the evidence does not permit a finding as to which ones. His access to the transcripts was for the purpose of undertaking his duties with the Crime Commission and ultimately to inform any of the evidence which he may give at the trials of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller. 

...

[30] After he returned to the ATO, Mr Tang viewed transcripts of a number of the examinations of witnesses. His purpose in so doing was to establish financial transactional material. He could not recall in his evidence whether this included the transcript of Mr McCarthy's and Mr Seller's evidence. On the probabilities, having regard to the nature of his ongoing duties and the content of his statements of evidence, I am satisfied that they did.""

22At the outset of his examination Mr McCarthy claimed privilege against self-incrimination in the manner provided for in s 30(4) of the Act. At the conclusion of his examination on 17 May 2007, the examiner gave a direction pursuant to s 25A(9) of the Act. That direction restricted distribution of the transcript of Mr McCarthy's evidence and certain documents produced by him to a number of persons or bodies including prosecution authorities. However, on the concluding day of his examination a further direction was made permitting distribution only to members of staff of the ACC and to the ATO for the purpose of its functions. In these circumstances there was, at least from that time to 22 August 2008, no authority to distribute the transcript of Mr McCarthy's evidence to the CDPP. 

23There had been no distribution of any part of the evidence given by Mr McCarthy prior to the direction given by the examiner at the conclusion of the examination. However, on 18 December 2007, material was provided by the ACC to the CDPP by way of a CD which included transcripts of the examinations of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller. The distribution of Mr McCarthy's evidence was contrary to the direction made by the examiner at the conclusion of the examination.

24On 22 August 2008, a delegate of the Chief Executive Officer of the ACC varied the direction made by the examiner in relation to Mr McCarthy. The variation permitted the distribution of the evidence given by Mr McCarthy in May 2007 to, amongst others, prosecution authorities. The variation was made under the power conferred in s 25A(10). The variation did not cover the evidence given by Mr McCarthy in July and September 2007.

25On 7 December 2009, the transcripts of the examinations of each of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller were made available to the CDPP in MS Word form.

26On 6 March 2012, a further variation was made to the previous directions by another delegate of the Chief Executive Officer. The variation occurred after the arraignment of Mr McCarthy and, as stated above, after the information had been supplied to the CDPP. The varied direction allowed distribution to, amongst others, the prosecuting authorities and its lawyers for use in any court proceedings brought against Mr McCarthy. The varied direction stated that the restriction on the admissibility of the material in court proceedings contained in s 30(5) of the Act applied but otherwise did not limit its use.

27Although the examination of Mr Seller was scheduled to commence on 31 July 2007, no evidence in fact was taken from him until 13 September 2007. Mr Seller claimed privilege against self-incrimination in the manner prescribed by s 30(4) of the Act. On the conclusion of the examination on 14 September 2007, the examiner made a direction under s 25A(9) of the Act that the evidence of Mr Seller and the documents produced by him not be distributed except to the Chief Executive Officer and staff of the ACC. The direction provided that it may be varied by the Chief Executive Officer but that such variation must not prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or the fair trial of a person who has been, or may be, charged with an offence. The direction was varied on 7 December 2007, to permit publication to:

""...any prosecution authority, the staff of such an authority, and counsel appointed by such an authority, to provide advice and in relation to the prosecution of offences for which they are responsible against Ross Seller, Patrick McCarthy, or Phillip Egglishaw.""

The power relied on in the direction to make the variation was a power conferred on the Chief Executive Officer by s 25A(10) of the Act. The authorisation to disseminate was on condition that the disseminated material be securely stored and not uploaded to any electronic storage system and not further published. Contrary to this direction, the CDPP stored the transcripts electronically on a computer drive within its system.

28As I indicated, the transcript of Mr Seller's evidence was provided to the CDPP on 18 December 2007. As the primary judge found, the decision to supply the information to the CDPP was made relying on the powers conferred on the Chief Executive Officer by s 59(7) of the Act. The record of decision created by the ACC and signed by the delegate of the Chief Executive Officer stated that the delegate was satisfied that the information was relevant to the activities of the CDPP.

The findings and conclusions of the primary judge

29The primary judge made factual findings in the terms outlined above. In addition, he made certain findings as to the use made of the material which have been challenged on appeal.

30The primary judge concluded that by 26 February 2009, the ACC, pursuant to s 12 of the Act, had provided a complete brief of evidence to the CDPP. A Mr Corkery, the CDPP officer in charge of the case, examined the brief for the purpose of determining which if any offences had been committed by Mr Seller and/or Mr McCarthy. The primary judge accepted that Mr Corkery did not read any of the transcripts of the evidence of either Mr McCarthy or Mr Seller. He also accepted that they had not been read by senior or junior counsel retained by the appellant.

31In considering the extent of the dissemination of the transcripts of the evidence of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller to officers of the CDPP, the primary judge referred to communications which indicated co-operation in the conduct of the investigation of the events surrounding the prosecution of Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy. The primary judge referred to various communications passing between the ACC and the CDPP and briefing papers supplied by the ACC to the CDPP in 2007. In particular, a briefing paper of 25 May 2007 made reference to material which had been derived from the evidence of Mr McCarthy and further information which it was hoped to be derived from his examination.

32The primary judge accepted that it was unlikely that any officers of the CDPP had access to the hard copy version of the transcripts which were stored in the office of Mr Corkery. However, he concluded that the position was not the same in relation to the electronically stored version. He referred to the fact that a number of identified officers had access to the electronically stored transcripts. No evidence was led from them as to whether or not they had access and no explanation was given as to the absence of any such evidence. In these circumstances, the primary judge was not prepared to conclude that there had not been access to the transcripts in electronic form.

33The ultimate conclusion of the primary judge on this issue was in the following terms:

""[125] I draw these conclusions with respect to the officers of the CDPP, other than Mr Corkery:

(a) each of the named officers were authorised to access the electronic file of the transcripts of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller;

(b) each of the officers at Director, Senior Assistant Director, Assistant Director or Assistant Deputy Director level, except for Ms Alexandrou, had supervisory and oversight roles with respect to Ms Shouldice and Mr Corkery, whilst they were worked on Operation Polbream, including recommending or approving the charges to be preferred and prosecuted against Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller;

(c) Ms Shouldice was, at one time, the CDPP case officer who was responsible for providing advice to the CDPP with respect to Operation Polbream and also for providing advice to and liaising with the Crime Commission with respect to Operation Polbream;

(d) the officers in (b) and (c), each had an interest and duties to perform, with respect to Operation Polbream, which meant that the nature of the defence likely to be raised by Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller, and the strength of the Crown case, having regard to what Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller said, was relevant to their functions and the decisions which were made, for which they were responsible or in which decisions they had a role to play; 

(e) there was no other source of information about the likely defences of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller except the transcripts of evidence and any documents which relied upon them;

(f) I would infer, from the foregoing, that it is likely that one or more of these officers read all or part of the transcripts of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller;

(g) the absence of evidence, which only the CDPP or the officers could provide, serves to strengthen the inference which I am prepared to draw;

(h) the legal officers and legal assistants, except for Ms Phang, who were authorised to have electronic access to those transcripts, were unlikely to have had access in the absence of a specific task being delegated to them by Mr Corkery which required them to access those transcripts;

(i) Mr Corkery denies giving any such specific tasks to any subordinate, except Ms Phang. I accept that evidence;

(j) it seems clear that Ms Phang was involved in the process of obtaining and copying transcripts for the purpose of them being provided to the solicitors for Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller, as part of the pre-trial disclosure process. Clearly, in the course of so doing, it is likely that she glanced at, and perhaps read, parts of the transcript for the purposes of ensuring that they were being correctly provided. I do not regard any such access as anything more than the minimum necessary to achieve the above task. Such access was neither meaningful nor significant. It is irrelevant for the purposes of this case.""

34I have already referred to the fact that the transcripts were available to Mr Quincy Tang and that it is proposed that he give evidence in the proceedings against Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy. The statements of evidence of Mr Tang proposed to be led at the trial of Messrs McCarthy and Seller were tendered at the hearing before the primary judge. His Honour reached the following conclusions in respect of that evidence:

""[136] These statements, together with the extent of the participation of Mr Tang in assisting Crime Commission officers to prepare for the compulsory examinations of Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy, leads me to conclude that Mr Tang has been one of the principal investigators of the whisky schemes, including investigating the conduct of Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy. He has been largely responsible for the compilation of the financial material which underlays an understanding of the whisky schemes and which, in large part, underlays the proof of the Crown case about the falsity of the statements made by Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy to officers of the ATO. The statements are those of an expert, the purpose of which is to objectively prove facts, against which the truth and accuracy of the statements made by the applicants will be tested.

...

[140] There is nothing apparent from the contents of his statements, which suggests that he has directly drawn specific information from the compulsory examinations of Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy as a basis, or source, of the conclusions which he has expressed in those statements. 

[141] However, I would readily conclude, that having heard or having read the evidence given at the compulsory examinations, particularly the evidence about the flow charts or diagrams shown to each of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller, which presented a complete picture of all of the steps involved in the transactions, in the interpretation of the documents with which he was provided, Mr Tang was materially assisted in the preparation of his statements of evidence. 

[142] By way of an analogy, a person who is required to piece together a jigsaw puzzle, does so entirely by the process of sorting the pieces, and then fitting them together. However, if that person has, albeit for a brief period, had the benefit of seeing the entire finished picture of the jigsaw puzzle, the task of identifying the various pieces of the jigsaw and then fitting them together, is much easier, and is much more readily achieved even if the complete picture is no longer in front of them.

[143] It is not possible for me to conclude, notwithstanding the terms in which the statements of Mr Tang are expressed, that his attendance at, listening to, and reading the transcripts of evidence of the compulsory examinations of Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy, together with looking at the documents which were tendered as a part of that examination, could have been completely put out of his mind when preparing the statements. I am satisfied that his knowledge of this material has contributed in a significant although indirect way to his evidence, and the conclusions which he expresses.""

35The primary judge reviewed the transcripts of the evidence of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller and made the following findings in respect of the evidence of Mr McCarthy:

""[59] This necessarily brief summary is sufficient to conclude that the compulsory examination of Mr McCarthy touched upon factual matters, the proof of which are necessary to sustain the criminal charge. 

[60] The examination also covered his view, and understanding, of the nature and structure of the arrangements, including the roles and functions of each of the relevant entities, and whether the ventures were accompanied by features of dishonesty. 

[61] These were matters about which Mr McCarthy had a right to silence and which engaged his privilege against self-incrimination generally, and also in respect of the specific charge which he now faces. As well, these are matters which may be relevant to any defence which he advances at trial.""

Similar conclusions were reached in relation to Mr Seller:

""[79] I am satisfied that the contents of the compulsory examination of Mr Seller dealt with factual matters which were central to the charge that he has now been confronted with, and to his defence of that charge.

[80] In particular, as with Mr McCarthy, the compulsory examination covered his view of the nature and structure of the arrangements and, to a limited extent, whether there were any features of dishonesty involved with various parts of the ventures.

[81] I am also satisfied with respect to the compulsory examination of Mr Seller, similarly to that of Mr McCarthy, that the contents of his examination clearly engaged his privilege against self-incrimination, both generally and in respect of the specific charge with which he is now confronted and required him to answer questions which he, ordinarily, was entitled to decline to give answers to.""

These conclusions were not challenged on appeal.

36The primary judge concluded that the Act did not authorise supply of the transcripts of evidence to the CDPP. In reaching that conclusion he placed particular reliance on the decision of the majority of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Australian Crime Commission v OK [2010] FCAFC 61; (2010) 185 FCR 258, and the decision of this Court in R v CB, MP v R [2011] NSWCCA 264. The primary judge drew the following conclusion from these judgments:

""[203] From all of the authorities to which I have made reference, but in particular the cases of OK and CB, I draw the following conclusions:

(a) the privilege against self-incrimination is an entrenched common law right which is deeply ingrained in the law;

(b) section 30 of the ACC Act abrogates that common law privilege;

(c) sections 30(4) and 30(5) of the ACC Act provide a limited compensation by retaining a protection against direct use of the evidence (or documents) obtained by compulsory process;

(d) section 25A of the ACC Act in general, and section 25A(9) in particular, protects against derivative use of the evidence (or documents) obtained by compulsory process where that derivative use might prejudice the fair trial of a person who may be charged with an offence;

(e) interference with justice by way of the prejudicing of a fair trial must be a practical, rather than a theoretical, reality;

(f) there is no practical reality that the course of justice and a fair trial would be interfered with, by reason only of the witness being required to answer questions, including disclosure of their defence, but only so long as an appropriate direction is in force under s25A(9) which preserves the confidentiality of the examination; and

(g) the right to a fair trial will be compromised if information relevant to a person's defence in any form, including derivative information, has been, or there was a real risk that it would be, communicated to prosecution authorities.""

37In these circumstances, the primary judge concluded that in the case of Mr McCarthy, the dissemination of the material was not authorised because up to March 2012 it contravened the examiner's directions, and thereafter, it was not in accordance with ""the principles established in OK"" (judgment at [249]). In the case of Mr Seller, the dissemination of the material was wrong because the direction of December 2007 was not authorised by the Act (judgment at [252]). The primary judge concluded that the effect was to impact adversely on a fair trial (judgment at [251]). His ultimate conclusion was expressed as follows:

""[253] The question then becomes what order, if any, ought be made was a matter of the exercise of discretion. I have found that:

(a) there has been indirect and derivative use of compulsorily obtained material;

(b) that derivative use was wrong because either it was contrary to a direction of the Examiner, or else because the relevant variation of the Examiner's direction was not authorised by the ACC Act;

(c) the transcripts of the evidence obtained during the compulsory examination contain material which would otherwise be caught by each applicant's privilege against self-incrimination, and which, but for the provisions of s 30 of the ACC Act would not be available to anyone except each applicant and their lawyer, unless each applicant waived their privilege; and

(d) the derivative use has provided the CDPP with the transcript of the examination and material derived from them. It has also assisted one of the witnesses upon whom reliance will be placed as part of the prosecution case.""

38In these circumstances the primary judge concluded that a permanent stay of the proceedings was appropriate. The primary judge concluded that the ACC deprived Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller of a ""fair trial in accordance with the adversarial process"" (judgment at [255]). This was because Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller lost their entitlement to have the contents of their examinations, in which they were obliged to forego their privilege against self-incrimination and which contained evidence relevant to their defence, kept confidential from the prosecution so that their right to a fair trial was ensured (judgment at [256]-[257]). The primary judge also concluded that a trial in those circumstances would be ""an offence to the administration of justice"" (judgment at [259]).

39The primary judge also awarded costs against the ACC subject to certain exceptions.

The grounds of appeal

40The appellant relied on the following grounds of appeal:

""Variation of non-publication direction - McCarthy

1. His Honour erred in holding that with respect to examinations of Patrick McCarthy conducted under Part II Division 2 of the Australian Crime Commission Act ('ACC Act') communication of the content of the examinations to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions ('CDPP') was 'wrong':

1.1. up to 6 March 2012 because it contravened a s.25A(9) direction made by the examiner on 13 September 2007 and

1.2. after 6 March 2012 because the variation made on that date, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Crime Commission ('CEO of the ACC'), to the examiner's direction of 13 September 2007 was not authorised by the ACC Act [249].

2. His Honour ought to have held that:

2.1. the CEO of the ACC on 6 March 2012 was not prohibited by s.25A(11) from varying the examiner's non-publication direction of 13 September 2007 with respect to Patrick McCarthy;

2.2. the examiner's non-publication direction of 13 September 2007, to the extent that it remained operative up to 6 March 2012, was effectively and lawfully varied by the CEO of the ACC on 6 March 2012 pursuant to s.25A(11), to permit dissemination of the content of the examinations to the CDPP;

2.3. in the alternative to 2.1 and 2.2, the disseminations prior to 6 March 2012 of the contents of the examinations of Patrick McCarthy themselves constituted variations by the CEO of the examiner's non-publication direction made on 13 September 2007 and such variations were lawful and effective and did not contravene s.25A(11).

3. His Honour erred in holding that, in relation to the examinations of Patrick McCarthy in May, June and September 2007, the examiner's s.25A(9) non-publication direction of 13 September 2007 (which did not permit dissemination of the examination contents to the CDPP) was material to the Respondent's stay application notwithstanding the variations to that direction made by the CEO under s.25A(10) on 22 August 2008, on 10 March 2009 and on 6 March 2012 [249(a)].

Variation of non-publication direction - Seller

4. His Honour erred in holding that communications by the CEO of the ACC to the CDPP of the content of the examinations of Ross Seller remained prohibited under the examiner's s.25A(9) direction of 14 September 2007 notwithstanding that the CEO varied the said non-publication direction on 7 December 2007 to permit such communication to the CDPP [250].

5. His Honour ought to have held:

5.1. that the CEO of the ACC on 7 December 2007 was not prohibited by s.25A(11) from varying the examiner's non-publication direction of 14 September 2007 with respect to Ross Seller;

5.2. that the variation on 7 December 2007 was made lawfully and effectively and

5.3. that the dissemination thereafter by the CEO of the contents of the examination of Ross Seller to the CDPP was permitted pursuant to s.59(7) of the ACC Act.

Making and varying non-publication orders - generally

6. His Honour erred in holding that the fair trial of the Respondents would be prejudiced within the meaning of sub-sections (9) and (11) of s.25A by the communication from the CEO of the ACC to the CDPP of the content of the examinations because the CDPP would be able to make derivative use of the examinations to gain information relevant to the Respondents' defences to the charges [203(g)], [246] and [248].

7. His Honour ought to have held that:

7.1. the words 'prejudice [to] the fair trial of a person who has been, or may be, charged with an offence' in sub-ss.(9) and (11) of s.25A do not include or extend to the dissemination under s.59(7) to the CDPP of the content of examinations which have been conducted prior to the examinee being charged;

7.2. dissemination to the CDPP of the content of examinations which have been conducted prior to charges having been laid is not capable of causing ""prejudice [to] the fair trial"" of the examinee, within the meaning of sub-ss.(9) and (11) of s.25A, because the ACC does not provide any protection to, or immunity of, the examinee with respect to derivative use of answers given which may tend to incriminate the examinee [188].

8. His Honour ought to have held, contrary to dicta in R v CB [2011] NSWCCA 264 at paragraphs [103] and [111], that:

8.1. the statutory authorisation by the CEO of the ACC, under s.59(7), to disseminate the content of examinations to the CDPP is not capable of being limited and is not limited by the terms of s.25A(9) itself and is only limited to the extent of any direction for non-publication or limited publication actually made by an examiner under s.25A(9) and not varied or revoked by the CEO of the ACC under s.25A(11) and

8.2. the relevant principle of law limiting the actions of the ACC with respect to examination of persons concerns examinations conducted after the examinee has been charged and is to the effect that such examinations may in appropriate cases be restrained by the Court as an interference with the administration of justice in relation to the charge (Hammond v Commonwealth (1982) 152 CLR 188) and that if a s.25A(9) direction has in fact been made and remains in force preventing dissemination to the prosecution then interference with the administration of justice may not arise.

Derivative use through statements of Mr Tang

9. His Honour erred in holding with respect to Mr Quincy Tang that:

9.1. to the extent Mr Tang used or had reference to the content of the examinations of the Respondents such use was 'wrong' because it breached non-publication directions made by the examiner pursuant to s.29A(9) or because, in so far as such directions were varied on 6 March 2012 (in relation to Patrick McCarthy) and on 7 December 2007 (in relation to Ross Seller) the variations were not authorised by the Act and were invalid [253] and

9.2. Mr Tang's use of and reference to the content of the examinations was a derivative use which contravened an obligation of the examiner pursuant to s.25A(9) to prevent distribution of the content of the examinations [254] and of the CEO not to vary or revoke the examiner's direction.

10. His Honour ought to have held with respect to Mr Quincy Tang that:

10.1. any use made by Mr Tang of the contents of the examinations of the Respondent whilst he was seconded to the ACC up until 2009 and any access that he had to the contents during that time was not in breach of any non-publication direction made with respect to the said examinations;

10.2. the variations to the non-publication directions made by the CEO of the ACC on 6 March 2012 (in relation to Patrick McCarthy) and on 7 December 2007 (in relation to Ross Seller) were valid and effective;

10.3. in so far as any of Mr Tang's preparation of witness statements with the assistance of the content of the examinations of the Respondents and his provision of those witness statements to the CDPP constituted or led to a derivative use by the CDPP of the answers given in the examinations, such derivative use was permissible having regard to the variations referred to in Ground 10.2.

Findings of fact concerning derivative use

11. His Honour erred in:

11.1. finding that it was likely one or more of Mr Joliffe, Mr Murphy, Mr Shaw, Ms Ryan and Ms Shouldice (all officers of the CDPP) read all or part of the transcripts of examination of the Respondents [117], [125(b) and (c)] and

11.2. failing to have regard to the evidence of Martin Corkery that he was the person in the CDP's office responsible for the prosecution of the Respondents and that neither he nor to his knowledge anyone else within the Office had read the examination transcripts.

12. His Honour ought to have held that the Respondents failed to discharge their burden of proving that any of the CDPP officers had read or made any material use of the transcripts.

Findings of irremediable prejudice to fair trial

13. His Honour erred in holding that by reason of such departures from the requirements of the ACC Act as were found:

13.1. the Respondents' right to a fair trial had thereby been compromised [255]-[258], [261];

13.2. their trial would be an offence to the administration of justice [259] and

13.3. the trial should be permanently stayed [257], [261].

Costs

14. His Honour erred in ordering that the CDPP pay the Respondents' costs of the application.

15. His Honour ought to have held that the Court had no power to award costs against the Crown in the absence of any express or implied statutory authorisation.""

The parties' submissions

A The Crown

41The Crown submitted that no prejudice to a fair trial or interference with the administration of justice could be found upon the basis of decisions such as Hammond v The Commonwealth [1982] HCA 42; (1982) 152 CLR 188. This is because such cases concern a compulsory examination of persons without the benefit of the privilege against self-incrimination after charges have been laid against them, which is contrary to the position in the present case. The Crown submitted these cases proceeded on the basis that a continuation of the examination would constitute an interference with the administration of justice and that could only occur if the acts in question (in this case the examinations and the dissemination) took place after charges had been laid. The Crown submitted that there was no independent concept of a fair trial and if the legislature had effectively abrogated the privilege against derivative use of self-incriminating material, then there was no basis for complaint about dissemination of the information to the prosecuting authorities.

42The Crown placed particular reliance on the fact that in considering the phrase ""might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence"" in s 25A(9) and s 25A(11), and in construing s 59(7) and s 59(8) of the Act, it was necessary to have regard to s 30(5). The effect of s 30(5) was to abrogate any protection against, or immunity from, derivative use of self-incriminating answers given in a compulsory examination under the Act. In that context the Crown relied upon the legislative history surrounding the introduction of s 30(5) to the Act and the Explanatory Memorandum to which I have referred in pars [15] and [16] above.

43The Crown accepted that the word ""might"" in the phrase in question qualified both the expression ""prejudice the safety or reputation"" and the words ""prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence"". However, it submitted that the power to specify the nature of the direction meant that any direction was to be given with variable stringency having regard to the circumstances of each particular case. The Crown submitted that different directions may be called for in the case of a person charged as distinct from those in relation to a person who might be charged. It submitted that in the former case it may be necessary, consistent with Hammond supra and OK supra, to direct that incriminating material not be distributed outside the ACC. However, in the case of a person not charged, the risk of a trial being unfair would generally be avoided by a direction prohibiting publication to the press or the public at large. It submitted that such a direction would have been adequate in the present case.

44So far as subs 59(7) and 59(8) of the Act were concerned, the Crown submitted that they conferred a general power of variation or revocation and were not subject to the limitation contained in the concluding phrase in s 25A(9) and s 25A(11).

45The Crown pointed to the fact that the only issue in OK supra was whether an examination of a charged person could continue in circumstances where there was in fact a non-publication direction preventing publication of the contents of the examination to prosecuting authorities or the police. The Crown submitted the case did not decide that an examiner would be generally required under s 25A(9) to prevent dissemination to the prosecuting authorities, or prevent the Chief Executive Officer revoking or varying a non-publication order to that effect. Further, it submitted that OK supra did not decide the scope of the phrase in question or that it would be engaged if dissemination to the authorities would permit derivative use to be made to formulate the Crown case, to gather evidence or anticipate defences.

46The Crown also pointed to the fact that CB supra was a case where a non-publication order had been made. The issue in that case was whether a stay of proceedings should be granted when an examination had continued after charge, but where the information so obtained could not be distributed to the prosecuting authorities by reason of the non-publication orders. The Court in that case declined a stay.

47However, the Crown submitted that the particular passages in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in CB supra (with which Buddin and Johnson JJ agreed) on which the primary judge relied in reaching his conclusions, overstated the effect of s 25A(9) and s 25A(11). The Crown submitted that it does so by concluding that those subsections prohibited in all cases (including both pre and post-charge examinations), the provision of information obtained during such examinations to prosecuting authorities.

48The Crown submitted that at least in the case where dissemination of the material in question predated the charge, there were strong indications in the Act that ""dissemination of the content to prosecuting authorities would not, for the purpose of the Act, constitute a risk of prejudice to the fair trial of the examinee or call for a non-publication direction to prevent the prosecution receiving the material"". It submitted that the legislature deliberately refrained from conferring derivative use immunity on the examinee and the conclusion contended for would, in effect, reinstate it contrary to Parliament's intention. It submitted that the interpretation was not logical because prejudice could equally result from the use of the material by the ACC. Finally, it submitted that if s 25A(9) and s 25A(11) were intended to have the suggested effect, it would have been expressly stated by the legislature.

49Senior counsel for the Crown submitted at the hearing that the common law placed two restraints on the legislature freely taking away the privilege against self-incrimination. The first, it submitted, was the need for a clear statement of legislative intention: Potter v Minahan [1908] HCA 63; (1908) 7 CLR 277. The second was that in cases such as Hammond supra, removal of the privilege could lead to interference with the administration of justice. However, he submitted that it has been established that the legislature can take away the privilege with the use of clear words and that this was the position in the present case. He referred to Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21; (1989) 166 CLR 486; Daniels Corporation International Pty Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49; (2002) 213 CLR 543 and NSW Food Authority v Nutricia Australia Pty Limited [2008] NSWCCA 252; (2008) 72 NSWLR 456.

50The Crown submitted that as the stay imposed by the primary judge was dependent on his incorrect construction of s 25A(9) and s 25A(11), it should not have been granted and the appeal should be allowed.

51The Crown also submitted that the expression ""law enforcement agency"" in s 59(7) of the Act was wide enough to include the CDPP and that there was no need to read the expression to exclude that body. It submitted that the express reference in s 12(1)(c) of the Act to any person or authority authorised to prosecute an offence, in addition to the reference to law enforcement agency in s 12(1)(b), was inserted as a matter of precaution and did not affect the construction of s 59(7) for which it contended.

52So far as the proposed evidence of Mr Tang was concerned, the Crown pointed out that Mr Tang had compiled the financial analysis of the transactions whilst he was seconded to the ACC. It was submitted that it was implicit in s 25A(5) that staff at the ACC were entitled to be present during the examination and that it would be surprising in these circumstances if they were prohibited from giving any evidence. At the hearing, senior counsel for the Crown submitted that all that the evidence of Mr Tang involved was an analysis of financial documentation and in those circumstances calling him would not prejudice a fair trial.

53The Crown submitted that the conclusions of the primary judge as to the use made of the transcripts by officers of the CDPP were erroneous. So far as Mr Corkery's predecessor as case officer, Ms Shouldice, was concerned, it was submitted there was no direct evidence that she had read the transcripts and no evidence of anything written or said by her which indicated that she had. It was conceded that she had read briefings from the CDPP which contained secondary reference to material derived from the examinations. It submitted that the bases the primary judge identified to support his conclusion were insufficient, particularly having regard to the evidence of Mr Corkery that Ms Shouldice did not say anything to him about the contents of the transcripts. 

54The Crown also submitted that the primary judge did not have a sufficient basis for inferring that the transcripts had been read by other officers of the CDPP. It also pointed out that the judge made no findings as to which part of the transcripts had been read or their significance to the prosecution. It submitted that this highlighted the difficulty of finding that the dissemination from the ACC to the CDPP might prejudice a fair trial.

B Mr Seller

55Mr Seller emphasised that the judgment was a discretionary one and that there was a need to demonstrate error. He pointed to the exceptional nature of the power vested in the ACC and submitted that the concluding phrases in s 25A(9) and s 25A(11) denoted a concern by the legislature to preserve both an individual's fundamental rights and the integrity of the curial process itself. He submitted that the dissemination of the compulsorily obtained evidence in advance of the prosecution compromised his right to a fair trial and was apt, absent an appropriate remedial order, to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

56Mr Seller submitted that there were two assumptions underpinning the analysis of s 25A(9) and (11) in the decision of the majority in OK supra. First, for what he (Mr Seller) described as the safeguards to be effective, they must be read as qualifying other provisions of the Act concerning the dissemination of compulsorily acquired material. Second, the safeguards will not have that effect if they are ignored. He submitted the same assumption underpinned the decision of this Court in CB supra. He also submitted that the use of the word ""might"" in each of the subsections indicated that the subsections were concerned with a possibility of prejudice to a fair trial, whilst the requirement to make a direction in those circumstances indicated that they were designed to eliminate the risk of such possible prejudice.

57Mr Seller submitted that the primary judge did not incorrectly assume that the Act deprived the prosecution of derivative use of an examinee's answers. He submitted that the primary judge was correct in concluding that s 25A(9) protects against derivative use where it might prejudice a fair trial, and further, the right to a fair trial will be compromised where information relating to a person's defences has been communicated to prosecutorial authorities. He submitted that although a general immunity against derivative use has been abolished, the significance of s 25A(9) and (11) was unaffected by the amendment which abolished the general immunity. Further, he submitted that to limit the operation of the protection to circumstances where a charge had been laid was contrary to the express words contained in the subsections. At the hearing, senior counsel for Mr Seller submitted that there remained two protections, one contained in s 30(4) and s 30(5)(a) and (b), and the other contained in s 25A(9) and (11). He described them as two level or multilayer protections and submitted that the protections contained in s 30(4) and s 30(5)(a) and (b) did not exhaust the risk of a fair trial not occurring.

58Mr Seller also submitted that s 59(7) could not authorise dissemination as the CDPP was not a law enforcement agency, which he submitted was a body concerned with the investigation and prevention of criminal offences. He submitted the CDPP was an independent body with an authority to determine whether or not to prosecute offences and a power and duty to carry forward such prosecutions. He submitted that the construction for which he contended was supported by the express reference in s 12(1)(c) of the Act to prosecution authorities in contrast with s 59(7). Senior counsel for Mr Seller submitted that the decisions of the Federal Court in AA Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2005] FCA 1178; (2005) 219 ALR 666 and Dunn v Australian Crime Commission [2008] FCA 424; (2008) 69 ATR 280 to the contrary were incorrect and reached without the benefit of detailed argument on the question.

59In these circumstances, Mr Seller submitted that the information should not have been disseminated and the primary judge was justified in ordering a stay. He submitted that once the information was disclosed to the CDPP, any future prosecution would necessarily involve an abuse of the Court's process. He submitted that it was impossible to now assert that such a right had not been prejudiced.

60In this context, senior counsel for Mr Seller placed particular reliance on the statement in par [111] of the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in CB supra:

""The right to a fair trial will only be compromised if information relevant to a person's defence in any form including derivative information is available to the prosecution.""

However he acknowledged that the word ""will"" in that sentence should in fact be read as ""could"".

61Senior counsel for Mr Seller pointed out in this context that one of the real prejudices suffered by the examinee was the inability to know what use had been made of the material. In that context he emphasised what was said by Spigelman CJ in John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324; (2004) 61 NSWLR 344 at [22]-[23] that it was an elementary right of every accused to a fair trial; that is, one fair as between prosecutor and accused.

62So far as the presence of Mr Tang at the examination was concerned, Mr Seller pointed to the finding by the primary judge in par [143] of his judgment that the evidence of the compulsory examination of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller contributed in a significant way to the evidence of Mr Tang. Mr Seller contended that this demonstrated prejudice to the respondents such that a fair trial was not possible.

C Mr McCarthy

63Mr McCarthy emphasised that the provision of his evidence to the CDPP was contrary to the directions given by the examiner. He submitted the primary judge was correct in inferring the transcript had been accessed by officers of the CDPP. He pointed to the absence of evidence from relevant officers of the ACC or any other evidence of who accessed the database.

64Mr McCarthy submitted that the importance of Hammond supra was the reference by Gibbs CJ to the fact that a detailed examination of a person in relation to an alleged offence is very likely to prejudice him in his defence. 

65Mr McCarthy pointed to the fact that the regime in s 25A of the Act is a regime specific to compulsory examinations. He submitted the protection was necessary having regard to the extensive powers conferred on the ACC. 

66Mr McCarthy submitted that the appellant failed to distinguish between derivative use by the ACC for the purpose of obtaining admissible evidence and derivative use by the CDPP.

67Mr McCarthy accepted that Mr Tang was entitled to look at the transcripts of examination, seek documents and provide analyses. However, he submitted that Mr Tang was prevented from being a prosecution witness because his conclusions may depend on what he heard and his evidence may be tailored to negate defences.

68Mr McCarthy submitted that the notions of fair trial and prejudice in the context of s 25A must have a broad operation. He submitted, relying on what was said by the High Court in Gedeon v Commissioner of New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] HCA 43; (2008) 236 CLR 120, that the expressions ""prejudice"" and ""fair trial"" are ""used to identify a criterion the satisfaction of which enlivens the exercise of the statutory power or discretion in question. If the criterion be not satisfied then the decision purportedly made in exercise of the power or discretion will have been made without the necessary statutory authority required of the decision maker"" (Gedeon supra at [43]).

69Otherwise Mr McCarthy adopted the submissions of Mr Seller.

Consideration

(a) The factual findings of the primary judge on the use of the transcripts by the CDPP - Grounds 11 and 12 of the Notice of Appeal

70It is convenient to deal with these grounds first.

71I have set out the conclusions and reasoning of the primary judge in pars [30]-[33] above. I do not think he was in error in reaching his conclusion. The inference that the transcripts had been read by officers of the CDPP was available to be drawn. As the primary judge pointed out, the CDPP and the ACC were co-operating in the investigation. The briefing paper to which he referred in par [84] of his judgment set out in considerable detail the investigation into the activities of the respondents that had been conducted up to that time and an estimated dollar value of the alleged fraud committed. The briefing paper also recommended a series of charges. On 6 December 2007, the ACC wrote to the CDPP for the attention of Ms Shouldice enclosing a substantially similar updated briefing paper. The letter also sought advice as to whether the available evidence was sufficient to support charges at least one of which was similar to the charges the subject of the ultimate indictment.

72It was on the following day that the non-publication orders in respect of the transcript of the evidence of Mr Seller was varied to permit dissemination to the CDPP. Further, as I indicated, one of the reasons for the exercise of the power under s 59(7) to make the transcripts available was that it was relevant to the activities of the CDPP.

73Further, on 4 December 2009, a Ms Phang of the CDPP requested the ACC make a Word version of the transcripts available. 

74This material, in my view, is capable of justifying an inference that officers of the CDPP read material which the ACC indicated was relevant to their task. The primary judge was entitled, in these circumstances, to more comfortably draw this inference where knowledge of material to rebut that inference was only in the possession of the ACC or the CDPP and such evidence was not forthcoming: Vetter v Lake Macquarie City Council [2001] HCA 12; (2001) 202 CLR 439 at [34].

75It follows, in my opinion, that Grounds 11 and 12 of the Notice of Appeal are not made out.

(b) The scope of s 25A - Grounds 1 - 9

76Fundamental to the Crown appeal was its submission that in circumstances where derivative immunity had been abolished, pre-charge distribution of examinations of potential accused to prosecutorial authorities could never prejudice a fair trial.

77I agree with the Crown's submission that cases such as Hammond supra do not directly assist the respondents in the present case. What was decided in that case was that once it was accepted that the plaintiff will be bound to answer questions designed to establish that he is guilty of an offence with which he is charged, there is a real risk that the administration of justice would be interfered with: Hammond supra at 198 per Gibbs CJ, with whom Mason J agreed. The principle as stated in that case, in my view, is dependent on court proceedings being in existence as there can be no interference with the administration of justice unless and until that occurs. However, it is relevant to the present case that the reason for the interference was the likelihood that any answers would prejudice the defence of the examinee at the trial. In Hammond supra at 198, Gibbs CJ stated the position in the following terms:

""Once it is accepted that the plaintiff will be bound, on pain of punishment, to answer questions designed to establish that he is guilty of the offence with which he is charged, it seems to me inescapably to follow, in the circumstances of this case, that there is a real risk that the administration of justice will be interfered with. It is clear that the questions will be put and pressed. It is true that the examination will take place in private, and that the answers may not be used at the criminal trial. Nevertheless, the fact that the plaintiff has been examined, in detail, as to the circumstances of the alleged offence, is very likely to prejudice him in his defence.""

See also Deane J at 206.

78The reason such an examination in the case of a charged person constituted an interference with the administration of justice was restated by Gibbs CJ in Sorby v The Commonwealth [1983] HCA 10; (1983) 152 CLR 281 at 294:

""In the absence of binding authority the matter must be approached from the standpoint of principle. If a witness is compelled to answer questions which may show that he has committed a crime with which he may be charged, his answers may place him in real and appreciable danger of conviction, notwithstanding that the answers themselves may not be given in evidence. The traditional objection that exists to allowing the executive to compel a man to convict himself out of his own mouth applies even when the words of the witness may not be used as an admission. It is a cardinal principle of our system of justice that the Crown must prove the guilt of an accused person, and the protection which that principle affords to the liberty of the individual will be weakened if power exists to compel a suspected person to confess his guilt. Moreover the existence of such a power tends to lead to abuse and to 'the concomitant moral deterioration in methods of obtaining evidence and in the general administration of justice'.""(Citation omitted)

79Notwithstanding, it is well established that the legislature is entitled to abrogate the privilege: Sorby supra at 294-295, 300; Pyneboard Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9; (1983) 152 CLR 328 at 341; Hamilton supra; Daniels supra at [11]. The position was summarised by Mason J in Hamilton supra at 494 in the following terms:

""It is plain that an examination under s.541 while charges are pending may expose the witness to the risks mentioned. To the extent only that under the section rights of an accused person are denied and protections removed, an examination may even amount to an interference with the administration of criminal justice. But it is well established that Parliament is able to 'interfere' with established common law protections, including the right to refuse to answer questions the answers to which may tend to incriminate the person asked: see Hammond v. The Commonwealth; Sorby. There has been a long history of legislation governing examinations in bankruptcy and under the Companies Acts which abrogate or qualify the right of the person examined to refuse to answer questions on the ground that the answers may incriminate him.""(Citations omitted)

80Further, it is clear in my opinion that the legislature has abrogated the privilege against indirect or derivative self-incrimination in the present case. Although s 30 of the Act does not expressly do so, having regard to the repeal of the protection against such use contained in s 30(5) of the predecessor legislation, such immunity has been abrogated by necessary implication. Although it is correct that a clear expression of legislative intent is required to take away a common law right, such an expression of intention can arise by necessary implication: Sorby supra at 305.

81The conclusion that I have reached from a consideration of the words of the Act is consistent with the statement of legislative purpose referred to in the Explanatory Memorandum, which I have extracted in par [16] above. This interpretation is consistent with the interpretation placed on the section by Weinberg J in A v Boulton [2004] FCA 56; (2004) 204 ALR 598 at [91]-[125], affirmed on appeal in A v Boulton [2004] FCAFC 101; (2004) 136 FCR 420 at [65]-[72]. I would follow that decision unless convinced it was plainly wrong. I am not so convinced. To the contrary I believe it is correct.

82In Boulton supra, Weinberg J rejected the submission that the principle stated in Hammond supra at 198, should be extended to persons about to be charged. He pointed out there was no certainty that a person about to be charged would be charged, and further, that there could not be an interference with the administration of justice or contempt of court when proceedings were not on foot: Boulton supra at [129]-[136]. I agree, but that does not deal with the question of dissemination of an examination which was held or the scope of s 25A of the Act. Boulton supra was an application for a declaration that the applicant was entitled to refuse to answer questions at an examination on the grounds they might incriminate him notwithstanding the provisions of s 30. No issue concerning s 25A of the Act arose.

83As the primary judge pointed out, s 25A of the Act has been the subject of judicial consideration by the Full Court of the Federal Court and by this Court. Each of those cases concerned charged examinees in respect of whom non-publication orders had been made. In OK supra, the examinee sought to restrain any further examination. The minority judge, Spender J, would have made such an order, but the majority, Emmett and Jacobsen JJ, declined to do so expressing the view that s 25A provided adequate protection to the charged person.

84The majority in OK supra took the view that there was an obligation on the examiner to give a direction where the failure to do so might prejudice the fair trial of a person charged with an offence. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer of the ACC was obliged not to vary such a direction if the variation had that effect. Their Honours stated the position in the following terms:

""[75] Under s 25A(9), an examiner may direct that any evidence given before the examiner must not be published, or must not be published except in such manner, and to such persons, as the examiner specifies. The examiner must give such a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been, or may be, charged with an offence. A person who makes a publication in contravention of a direction given under s 25A(9) is guilty of an offence. Under s 25A(10), the CEO may vary or revoke a direction under s 25A(9). However, the CEO must not vary or revoke a direction if to do so might prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been, or may be, charged with an offence."" (Emphasis in original)

85Their Honours stated that the purpose of s 25A was to manage the risk of prejudice to a fair trial. In that context they made the following remarks:

""[107] A significant difference between the circumstances of Hammond's Case and the circumstances of the present case is the regime that is now provided for in s 25A of the Commission Act. Under the Commission Act generally, and s 25A in particular, the risk of prejudice to a fair trial is to be managed by confining the persons to whom answers given by a witness can be disclosed, not by confining the questions that might be put to the witness. The Commission Act provides its own statutory safeguards to avoid risk to the fair trial of such a charge. On its true construction, the Commission Act permits an examination to continue on a subject matter directly related to a pending charge so long as the protective prohibitions contemplated by s 25A(3) and (9) have been put in place. Such principle as might relevantly be drawn from Hammond's Case is displaced by the express provisions of the Commission Act. 

...

[109] The objects of the Commission Act could be seriously impaired if its investigations had to stop for an indeterminate period because charges had been laid. The public interest requires the investigation of a federally relevant criminal activity to continue. The right to a fair trial will not be compromised merely by the asking of questions of an accused person in circumstances where appropriate confidentiality is ensured. The public interest in the administration of justice, in particular to the right to a fair trial, is preserved by the statutory safeguards referred to in [43] above. In this way the legislation achieves a balance between the public interest in the investigation of federally related criminal activity and the public interest in the right of an accused person to a fair trial. Compromise, if any, would occur by reason of the deployment or dissemination of information obtained in a way that poses a real risk to a fair trial. A non-publication direction made under s 25A of the Commission Act remains operative unless and until it is varied or revoked. Such a direction binds the Board, the Commission and the CEO when disseminating, under s 12 or s 59, any information gathered at an examination conducted subject to such a direction.""

86The majority in OK did not differentiate between the position of a person charged or a person who may be charged. That is consistent with the words of the section. However, it was not necessary for the Court to consider what might prejudice a fair trial of a person who had not been charged but who might be charged in the future, or whether the abrogation of the privilege against indirect or derivative self-incrimination coupled with the limited protection offered by s 30(4) and (5) had any effect on the obligation to give a direction under s 25A(9) and (11).

87Importantly, their Honours held that the powers and obligations imposed by s 12(1) on the Chief Executive Officer and the Commission, and the power of dissemination granted to the Chief Executive Officer by s 59(7), must be read subject to any direction given under s 25A(9): OK supra at [108].

88CB supra concerned an application for a stay of proceedings by persons whose examination had continued after charges had been laid but whilst a direction under s 25A was in place.

89In CB supra, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) expressed his agreement with the opinion of the majority in OK. In particular, he agreed that the powers and duties under s 12 and the power conferred on the Chief Executive Officer under s 59(7) were subject to any direction under s 25A(9): CB supra at [110]. His Honour went on to make the following remarks:

""[111] Provided the knowledge of the proceedings in the Commission are adequately protected an accused person's entitlement to a fair trial in accordance with the adversarial process will be ensured. The situation is no different whether at the time of the Commission hearing a charge has not been laid or the criminal process had commenced. The right to a fair trial will only be compromised if information relevant to a person's defence in any form, including any derivative information, is available to the prosecution.

...

[128] Although I accept that questions were asked of the appellant during his examination relating to matters relevant to the charges, accepting as I do that the majority decision in OK should be followed, provided the information obtained was effectively protected as the Commission acknowledged it should be, the mere fact that an examination has occurred could not justify a permanent stay. Even if, and the evidence does not establish this fact, it was the case that questions were asked which required the appellant to disclose his defence, this would not of itself have the consequence that the appellant would be denied 'a fair trial.' Only if it can be shown that either the relevant information has been, or there was a real risk that it would be communicated to the prosecution, could it be concluded that the exceptional step of granting a permanent stay should be taken.""

90It is important to note that in par [111] of his judgment in CB supra, his Honour did not distinguish between the position pre-charge and post-charge.

91At the end of the day s 25A must be construed having regard to the words used taking into account its legislative history and context: Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Limited v Commissioner of Territory Revenue [2009] HCA 41; (2009) 239 CLR 27 at 31; Commissioner of Taxation v Consolidated Media Holdings Ltd [2012] HCA 55; (2012) 293 ALR 257 at [39]. The parties accepted that the word ""might"" qualified both limbs of the concluding phrase of s 25A(9) and s 25A(11); ""the safety or reputation of a person"" and ""the fair trial of a person"". The word ""might"" in those circumstances means a real risk as distinct from one that is remote or fanciful: cf Hammond supra at 196.

92The more difficult question is what constitutes prejudice to a fair trial for the purpose of the subsection. The concept is not capable of precise definition. In the passage of Sorby supra cited in par [78] above, Gibbs CJ suggested a fair trial would be compromised if a person was obliged to incriminate him or herself.

93In Environment Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co Pty Limited [1993] HCA 74; (1993) 178 CLR 477 at 501, Mason CJ and Toohey J, citing with approval the principle expressed by Viscount Sankey in Woolmington v Director of Public Prosecutions [1935] AC 462 at 481-482, stated that it was a fundamental principle of the common law that the onus rests on the Crown of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is complemented by ""the elementary principle that no accused person can be compelled by process of law to admit the offence with which he or she is charged"". However, their Honours had reservations that the protection against production of incriminating books and documents was an essential element in the accusatorial system of justice: Caltex supra at 503. Their Honours also made it clear that the principle could be abrogated: Caltex supra at 503. McHugh J, at 545, cited three justifications for the privilege which were consistent with it being conducive to a fair trial. The first was the need to protect human dignity and freedom. In respect of that justification, he made the following remarks at 546:

""This justification is closely associated with concern at the possibility of abuse of the power by the Crown which, as I have pointed out, was the historical reason for the privilege. But the desire to protect the human dignity of the accused is a separate and important justification of the privilege. A rule which requires the prosecution to prove the guilt of an accused in the course of a judicial proceeding without reliance on his or her incriminating answers compulsorily obtained ensures that the prosecution must treat the accused as an innocent person whose rights as a human being must be respected. The 'show trials' of the totalitarian state are hardly possible in a system where the accused cannot be compelled to incriminate him or herself and the plea of not guilty at the commencement of the trial puts the Crown to proof of every issue and entitles the accused to a presumption of innocence until a guilty verdict displaces that presumption."" (Citations omitted)

His Honour also stated that a further justification for the privilege was that it maintained the integrity of the accusatorial system by forcing the prosecution to rely upon independent evidence rather than the self-incrimination of the accused.

94Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ dissented on the question of whether a corporation was entitled to privilege against self-incrimination. At 527, their Honours cited with approval the passage from the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Sorby supra, which I have referred above in par [78]. Their Honours also made the following comments at 532:

""The privilege against self-incrimination confers an immunity which is deeply embedded in the law. In the end, it is based upon the deep-seated belief that those who allege the commission of a crime should prove it themselves and should not be able to compel the accused to provide proof against himself.""(Citations omitted)

See also Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v De Vonk [1995] FCA 994; (1995) 61 FCR 564.

95In Lodhi v R [2007] NSWCCA 360; (2007) 179 A Crim R 470, [74], Spigelman CJ emphasised that the High Court had not recognised the right to a fair trial as a freestanding right. Nevertheless, in Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57; (1992) 177 CLR 292, at least four members of the Court seemed to take the view that although there had been no attempt to list exhaustively the attributes to a fair trial and that the concept was one which was impossible to formulate exhaustively in advance, nonetheless the right was ingrained in the legal system of this country: Dietrich supra at 301 (Mason CJ and McHugh J), 327-328 (Deane J), 353 (Toohey J).

96In Nutricia supra, Spigelman CJ, with whom Hidden and Latham JJ agreed, pointed out that the judgment of Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Caltex supra on this issue was not affected by their conclusion that self-incrimination immunity was available to a corporation. His Honour, after referring to Caltex supra, made the following remarks:

""[155] The accusatory system is, in my opinion, a fundamental element of our traditional method of determining criminal guilt. A public authority which formally alleges criminal conduct by a person must prove it. As recognised in the reasons of Mason CJ and Toohey J set out at 474 [67]-[68] supra and the observations of Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ set out at 490 [153] supra, the accusatory system is not co-extensive with the privilege against self-incrimination. It is derived, as many other aspects of our criminal procedure are derived, from the recognition of the imbalance of power between the State and its citizens. That imbalance extends to corporations.""

97His Honour, however, concluded that indirect or derivative use of material compulsorily obtained was not necessarily sufficient to constitute ""a relevant alteration or abridgment of the accusatory system"". He stated the position was reasonably clear where derivative use impinges on a rule of substantive law such as privilege against self-incrimination, but the accusatory system was not such a rule: Nutricia supra at [164]-[165]. At [172], he considered the issue of derivative use raised questions of fact and degree. He also expressed the view at [124] and [134]-[135] that the commencement of proceedings usually makes a critical difference to the weight to be given to the public interest in the enforcement of the regulatory scheme. However, at [102], his Honour emphasised that the principle of a fair trial was not engaged in that case.

98Having regard to these authorities, it would seem to me that if the privilege against indirect or derivative self-incrimination had not been abrogated, s 25A(9) and s 25A(11) would require a direction to be made prohibiting the dissemination of self-incriminating material to prosecuting authorities both in the case of a person charged and a person who might be charged. This is because the use of such material by the Crown might prejudice a fair trial in the sense discussed by Gibbs CJ in Hammond supra and Sorby supra, and by the members of the High Court in Caltex supra in the passages to which I have referred above. Prior to the 2001 amendments, the Act provided two safeguards to a person being examined; first, that the undertaking provided for in s 30(5) be given and, second, the requirement for a direction under s 25A(9).

99The question remains whether the amendment to s 30, which had the effect of abrogating the privilege against indirect incrimination, leads to the conclusion that a fair trial for the purpose of s 25A of the Act could not be compromised by the disclosure of direct or indirect incriminating material to prosecuting authorities. In these circumstances the question is whether the only protection to which an accused or potential accused is entitled is that, at least in the case of answers given and in respect of some documents, the material would not be admissible in evidence. The Crown argued this was the effect of the amendment, at least when the material was disseminated prior to a charge being brought. 

100I do not agree. Where a statute is amended both the act which is amended and the amending act must be read together as a combined statement of the will of the legislature as a consequence of which the effect of the amending act may be to alter the meaning which the remaining provisions of the amended act bore before the making of the amendments: Commissioner of Stamps (SA) v Telegraph Investment Co Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 44; (1995) 184 CLR 453 at 463; Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 7th ed (2011) LexisNexis at [7.23]. However, it does not seem to me that the amendment to s 30 compels a conclusion that s 25A(9) has no application in the case of dissemination of self-incriminating material to prosecutorial authorities.

101As I indicated, the legislation as originally enacted contained two safeguards, the first in the original s 30 and the second in s 25A. As was said in OK supra at [109], the object of s 25A was to preserve a statutory safeguard to the right to a fair trial. If it was intended that the amending legislation was to take away that right, such an intention in my opinion, would need to have been clearly expressed: Potter supra at 304.

102That does not mean that s 25A would prohibit all derivative use of the material. So, for example, I do not believe a fair trial generally will be prejudiced by the use of information obtained during the course of an examination to obtain admissible evidence. Thus, answers which would tend to indicate the availability of admissible evidence could properly be used for this purpose. For example, in cases such as the present this may include the location of bank accounts. Further, it does not seem to me that the use by the prosecution of documents produced during the course of an examination which supported the Crown case, usually would compromise a fair trial. However, the question of whether derivative use of such material could have that effect will always depend on the material in question and the circumstances of its use.

103This in my opinion is consistent with what was said by Mason CJ and Toohey J in Caltex supra at 503, and by Spigelman CJ in Nutricia supra at [164]-[174] (see pars [93] and [96] above). It is also consistent with what was said by McClellan CJ at CL in CB supra at [99]. It also means that s 25A would not preclude the ACC from carrying out the investigatory functions imposed on it by s 7A and s 12 of the Act. 

104The position is different in my opinion if the provision of the material in question discloses defences or explanations of transactions by the accused which he or she may raise at a trial, and possibly evidence or information which would tend to show that documents or transactions apparently regular on their face in fact tend to support the proposed charges. This would be contrary to the principles stated by Gibbs CJ in Sorby supra, and by Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Caltex supra, that the onus is on the Crown to prove its case and that the prosecution must prove it without reliance on incriminating answers. To provide to prosecutorial authorities material compulsorily obtained relating to such matters could compromise a fair trial in accordance with these principles.

105As McClellan CJ at CL pointed out in CB supra at [111], the principles are the same whether the material is provided before or after charge. The risk to a fair trial as envisaged by s 25A(9) and (11) is the same irrespective of when charges are brought. In the case of pre-charge dissemination the risk will only materialise when charges are in fact brought. That does not mean that courts may not take a different approach in assessing what, if any, relief should be given if the dissemination is pre or post-charge. It is simply to say that the statute itself looks in each case to possible prejudice to a fair trial, and the requirement of a direction does not differentiate between pre and post-charge dissemination.

106Two matters must be emphasised. First, it is impossible to state generally the nature and type of dissemination which might prejudice a fair trial. It will depend in all cases on the nature of the material to be disseminated, the function of the person or body to whom the material is to be disseminated and in some cases the timing of the dissemination. Secondly and importantly, s 25A(9) and s 25A(11) of the Act are directed to the question of whether the material might prejudice a fair trial. Any relief given as a result of dissemination contrary to a direction or in circumstances where a direction should have been given, would depend upon whether in fact the dissemination has compromised the accused's rights to a fair trial and what steps are necessary to alleviate the position. I do not understand McClellan CJ at CL to be saying anything different in pars [111] and [128] of his judgment in CB supra. In particular, I do not understand him to say that in all cases where information relating to a defence is furnished to prosecutorial authorities, a stay should be granted. If that is what his Honour was saying, I would respectfully disagree. 

107In each of OK supra and CB supra, the Court held the power in s 59(7) of the Act was subject to a direction given pursuant to s 25A(9). I respectfully agree for the reasons given in those cases.

108Applying these principles, the primary judge's findings concerning the nature of the material supplied to the CDPP justified his conclusion that dissemination to the CDPP might prejudice a fair trial and that it should not have taken place having regard to the requirements of s 25A(9). This relates, in particular, to the primary judge's conclusions in pars [60] and [61] in relation to Mr McCarthy and his conclusions in pars [79] and [81] in relation to Mr Seller.

109In these circumstances it is unnecessary to deal with the argument that the CDPP is not a law enforcement office for the purpose of s 59(7) of the Act.

(c) Should a stay have been granted?

110As I have stated, the fact that dissemination took place in contravention of a direction or in circumstances where a direction should have been given, does not automatically entitle the accused to a stay. The principles on which a permanent stay is granted are set out in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in CB supra and it is unnecessary to repeat them. I would merely add what was said by Mason CJ in Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 30, where the Chief Justice indicated his agreement with Richardson J in Moevao v Department of Labour (1980) 1 NZLR 464 at 482 that the justification for a stay is to prevent the court process being employed in a manner inconsistent with the recognised purpose of the administration of criminal justice and so constituting an abuse of process. Further, a stay will only be granted in an extreme case and the fundamental defect which warrants a stay must be such that there is nothing a trial judge can do to relieve against its unfair consequences: The Queen v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 605.

111The primary judge concluded at [258] that the conduct of the ACC and the CDPP in disseminating and reading the material deprived the respondents of the protection which the law ensured, such that any trial would not be fair and so a stay should be granted.

112With the greatest respect to his Honour, he erred in the exercise of his discretion in failing to consider whether in fact the dissemination of the material and its reading by some officers of the CDPP resulted in a fundamental defect in the trial process such that a stay should be ordered. The primary judge, whilst correctly concluding that there was a risk of prejudice such that a direction should have been given, did not consider whether such prejudice had in fact occurred. It is apparent from the conclusion in par [203] of his judgment that he took the view that a stay should be granted whenever there was communication of a person's defence in any form including derivative information to prosecutorial authorities, or where there was a real risk that such communication would occur: judgment at [203](g). It may be that the primary judge in reaching this conclusion was following what he perceived to be the reasoning in par [111] of the judgment in CB supra. As I indicated, I do not believe that that was what was being said in par [111] of the judgment in CB supra, and if it was, I do not believe it to be correct.

113In the present case Mr Corkery has been the case officer since 2008. The primary judge accepted that he did not read the transcripts in carrying out his functions as case officer. Mr Corkery also said that he was not told anything about the content of the examinations by his predecessor Ms Shouldice. It was not suggested to Mr Corkery that any of his superiors referred to in par [125](b) of the judgment of the primary judge discussed the transcripts with him. Further, the primary judge accepted that counsel retained by the CDPP have not had access to the transcripts or any information concerning their contents.

114In these circumstances, there was no evidence before his Honour to justify his conclusion that the trial would suffer from a fundamental defect as a result of the delivery of the transcripts to the CDPP. Further, there is no evidence to suggest use will be made of the transcripts in the future. In these circumstances the delivery of the material to the CDPP and the finding by the primary judge that one or more of certain officers may have read the transcripts does not justify a permanent stay.

115There remains the evidence proposed to be given by Mr Tang. I have considered this evidence and it consists of no more than an analysis by an accountant of the financial consequences of certain transactions evidenced in documents considered by him. Even if it be accepted that Mr Tang derived some form of improper advantage from hearing the evidence of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller and seeing their transcripts, this would not justify a permanent stay. At most it would lead to the exclusion of his evidence. That is a matter for the trial judge to consider.

116In these circumstances the appeal should be allowed and the stay granted by the primary judge be set aside. It follows that irrespective of whether the primary judge had power to make the costs order the subject of Grounds 14 and 15 of the Notice of Appeal, that order should also be set aside.

117I should add that it would not be appropriate for the CDPP to make any use of the transcripts in the future conduct of this case. If I were of the opinion that there was a threat that this would occur, I would have made the setting aside of the stay subject to an undertaking by the Director that no further use would be made of them. However, in the circumstances, I do not consider this to be necessary.

Orders

118The orders I would make are as follows:

1 Grant leave to appeal.

2 Appeal allowed.

3 The orders that the primary judge made on 17 August 2012 be set aside and in lieu thereof the motion filed by the first respondent on 27 February 2012 and by the second respondent on 28 February 2012, be dismissed.

119McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice for the reasons he gives.

120The Chief Justice is correct in his understanding of [111] and [128] of my judgment in R v CB which he discusses at [106] and [112] of his judgment. However, I accept that my remarks in R v CB may have been more readily understood if I had used the word ""could"" rather than ""will"" when speaking of the circumstances in which the right to a fair trial may be compromised.

121ROTHMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice and I agree with the orders he proposes.

122I also agree with the reasons given by the Chief Justice as to why, in the circumstances of this case, a permanent stay of proceedings should not have been granted (see [110] and following).

123Otherwise, I agree generally with the reasons of the Chief Justice and would seek to add some comment on some aspects. It is unnecessary to reiterate the facts or the legislative background to these proceedings. I use the same abbreviations as the Chief Justice has used.

124The Act is not concerned, other than peripherally, with the conduct of criminal trials. Nor has the legislature sought to constrain the power or jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (or any other court) to ensure a fair trial. The Act primarily concerns the investigation of suspected criminal conduct. The provisions abrogating the right to silence are to render more efficacious that primary purpose. The provisions empowering the Commission to prohibit or qualify publication of material obtained compulsorily during the investigative process seek to limit the unfairness that the process, by the abrogation of that right, may cause a subsequent trial.

125It is in that context that the relationship between the abrogation of the right to silence under the Act and the power or jurisdiction of a court to make orders preventing an unfair trial must be considered. The Act does not affect the Court's power or jurisdiction over the curial process. Rather, it provides a mechanism by which the Commission can act to ameliorate potential unfairness in the curial process, the final determination of which rests with the Court.

126Further, if, in contravention of an order of the Commission restricting publication, a prosecuting authority were to obtain and utilise material, a court would need to deal with any tender of the material (or derived material) under the provisions of s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995. Even if the Commission were to permit a prosecuting authority to obtain material and there were no unlawfulness or impropriety in its receipt, a court may, nevertheless, need to deal with the tender of material under one or more of the discretionary exclusionary provisions in the Evidence Act (for example, s 90, s 137).

127In other words, without qualifying the comments of the Chief Justice at [106], the primary consideration of a court in determining whether to take steps to prevent or to prohibit an unfair trial is the effect of the dissemination of the acquired material on the trial. The effect may be identical whether or not there is a contravention of a non-publication order and does not depend upon a contravention. If there were a contravention, then the court that deals with the alleged unfairness has an additional layer of discretion to exercise, but the ultimate question, as to whether or not to grant a stay, remains the same.

128On my analysis, the Act does not affect the exercise of discretion of a court in granting a permanent stay. It is not for the Commission (or any of its officers) to determine, in a manner that would bind or affect the court, whether a publication or use of material would or might lead to an unfair trial.

129The legislature in enacting these provisions has not abrogated or affected the power or jurisdiction of the court to grant a stay. It has abrogated the right to silence for the purpose of the Act and implemented provisions that are intended to prevent a trial from miscarrying.

130It is also in that context that the principle of construction or presumption that Parliament does not intend to modify or abrogate fundamental rights must be approached. As stated by the Chief Justice, the rationale for that approach was expressed by the High Court in Potter v Minahan at 304. This rationale was reiterated in Bropho v State of Western Australia [1990] HCA 24; (1990) 171 CLR 1 at 18 (per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ), Coco v The Queen [1994] HCA 15; (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437 (per Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) and Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers Union [2004] HCA 40; (2004) 221 CLR 309. In the last mentioned judgment, Gleeson CJ, after reciting the passage in Coco, said:

""[21] The joint judgment in Coco went on to identify as the rationale for the presumption against modification or abrogation of fundamental rights an assumption that it is highly improbable that Parliament would ""overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general system of law"" without expressing its intention with ""irresistible clearness"". In R v Home Secretary; Ex parte Pierson, Lord Steyn described the presumption as an aspect of the principle of legality which governs the relations between Parliament, the executive and the courts. The presumption is not merely a common sense guide to what a Parliament in a liberal democracy is likely to have intended; it is a working hypothesis, the existence of which is known both to Parliament and the courts, upon which statutory language will be interpreted. The hypothesis is an aspect of the rule of law.""

131The judgment of Gleeson CJ in Electrolux went on to recognise that, in the legislation there being examined, the common law rights were of a kind frequently modified by statute. Such is not the situation in this appeal. I would, in those circumstances, take the view that any abrogation of common law rights in the Act would require express words or words of necessary intendment. I understand the Chief Justice's reasons at [80] to be to that effect, and agree with his conclusion therein, because of the legislative history described by the Chief Justice and the context of a discretion in the Court, unaffected by the legislation.

132There may be circumstances, not yet encountered, where the abrogation of rights and the consequent unfairness is so fundamental as to involve issues arising under Chapter III of the Constitution. That is not the case here. Otherwise, I agree that the legislature always retains the capacity to abrogate rights.

133I comment on some other matters of detail. First, I agree with the conclusion of the Chief Justice as to the availability of inferences to which he refers at [74]. The drawing of the inference by the primary judge was available on the evidence adduced. It did not require proof beyond reasonable doubt. Further, it is an inference drawn against the Crown: see RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3; (2000) 199 CLR 620 at [22], [27] and [28].

134Secondly, I take the view that it is unnecessary, in the present case, to express a view as to material that would not be prejudicial to a fair trial on any general basis. Each case will depend upon its own facts. At [102], the Chief Justice expresses a tentative view. I leave such an issue for another occasion.

135The reason for the foregoing qualification is that ultimately it may not be the disclosure of the defence, per se, that causes the prejudice, but the disclosure of material (whether or not admissible, or whether of a state of mind, or other fact incapable of independent proof) the effect of which is to render the Crown case able to be proved, where, otherwise, it would not be. It will be a matter initially for the trial judge, on a case-by-case basis, to determine whether sufficient unfair prejudice is created, whether any exceptional orders are warranted and, if so, which orders.

136Lastly, I comment on derivate use privilege and the documents in this case. In my view, the use of the testimony at ACC, if used, would have been only to facilitate the discovery of the money trail or its confirmation. As the primary judge put it (at [142]), it enabled the jigsaw puzzle to be completed more easily.

137The assumption in the primary judge's analogy is that all of the pieces of the puzzle are available and, without the ACC testimony, the puzzle could have been solved by the application of sufficient time, energy and intelligence. Even in the United States, where derivative use privilege (more colourfully designated Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine), derived from illegal search, has constitutional sanction, there are long-standing exceptions to its application in circumstances including inevitable discovery (expounded in Somer v US (1943) 138 F2d 790; Wayne v US (1963) 318 F2d 205 [cert.den 375 US 860] or independent source (see Silverthorne Lumber Co v US (1920) 251 US 385), or where the material is significantly distinguishable from the illegal discovery (see Wong Sun v US (1963) 371 US 471). In my view, the discovery of the money trail was inevitable, given that all of the documents had already been independently obtained. A similar approach has been taken in the United States: see US v Kraus (1921) 270 F 578.

138I reiterate my agreement with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice and, subject to the foregoing, with his reasons therefor.

		01 March 2013",2013-02-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761053,"PHAN, Thanh Dinh v R [2013] NSWCCA 49","Judgment

1McCLELLAN JA: I agree with Hidden J.

2HIDDEN J: The applicant, Thanh Dinh Phan, pleaded guilty in the District Court to two charges of importing a commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine, an offence under s 307.11(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment. Williams DCJ sentenced him on the first count to imprisonment for 8 years, commencing on 28 February 2011, and on the second count to imprisonment for 11 years, commencing on 28 February 2012. His Honour fixed a non-parole period of 8 years. The overall sentence, then, was 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years, commencing on 28 February 2011. The sentences were accumulated upon sentences which the applicant was already serving, and the significance of that commencement date will become apparent. He seeks leave to appeal against the sentences. 

3Given the limited scope of the application, it is unnecessary to examine in any detail the facts of the offences or the applicant's subjective case. Judge Williams also dealt with several co-offenders, charged with different but related offences, but no question of parity arises and their cases need not be considered.

4The two offences occurred in March 2007. Two consignments, both containing very large quantities of pseudoephedrine, arrived in Australia. Judge Williams was satisfied that the applicant was the principal in the importation, describing him as ""the business end in Australia of whatever was occurring elsewhere."" 

5Significantly, at the time these offences were committed the applicant was on bail in respect of similar offences, albeit less serious, committed in 2003. He and his wife were involved in the importation of pseudoephedrine, then an offence under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), and a conspiracy to possess pseudoephedrine as a precursor to the manufacture of methylamphetamine, an offence under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1986 (NSW). For those offences Charteris DCJ imposed partly cumulative sentences aggregating 7 ½ years with an effective non-parole period of 4 ½, years, dating from 1 September 2006. That non-parole period expired on 28 February 2011 and, as I have said, it was on that date that the first of the sentences imposed by Judge Williams was directed to commence. 

6Subjectively, the applicant was a mature man, born in Vietnam but settling in this country in 1986. He was well educated, and worked as a pharmacist for some years before a gambling habit led him into considerable debt. It was in those circumstances, it seems, that he became involved in criminal activity. He and his wife have a daughter. 

7Psychological reports identified a chronic gambling addiction, together with symptoms of major depression. At the time of sentence he enjoyed strong family support, and members of his family were caring for his daughter. However, he and his wife were incarcerated in different prisons a considerable distance apart, and his opportunity to enjoy visits from his daughter was limited. 

The application

8Counsel for the applicant, Mr Odgers SC, argued the application on one ground only: that the sentencing judge erred in the determination of the non-parole period.

9Mr Odgers noted that the non-parole period of 8 years was two-thirds of the overall sentence of 12 years imposed by his Honour, within the range of what was then seen as the normal ratio between head sentence and non-parole period for Commonwealth offences. The sentences were passed on 3 July 2009, before the High Court put paid to any notion of a ""norm"" in that ratio in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45, 242 CLR 520. It was in the effect of the accumulation of that aggregate sentence upon the non-parole period which the applicant was then serving, Mr Odgers submitted, that his Honour fell into error. The result of that accumulation was a total sentence for all offences of 16 ½ years with an overall non-parole period of 12 ½ years, dating from 1 September 2006. That overall non-parole period was almost 76% of the total sentence. Mr Odgers argued that his Honour had overlooked the fact that that would be the result of the manner in which the sentences were structured.

10He noted that the proportion between the effective non-parole period of 4 ½ years and the aggregate sentence of 7 ½ years imposed by Judge Charteris for the 2003 offences was 60%, and he argued that there was no reason why a similar proportion should not have been maintained in the structure of the sentences imposed by Judge Williams for the 2007 offences. He acknowledged that the fact that those later offences were committed whilst on bail for the earlier offences was a serious aggravating circumstance, but he argued that effect was given to that circumstance in the determination of the head sentences and the decision that they should be served wholly cumulatively upon the non-parole period for the earlier offences. 

11Mr Odgers raised as a related consideration the fact that, after the applicant was sentenced by Judge Charteris in October 2007, the pendency of the present charges meant that he remained in the remand section of Goulburn Correctional Centre, where he was held, until Judge Williams passed sentence in July 2009. As a result, for that period of over 1 ½ years he endured the conditions of remand without being able to progress through the classification system. This, Mr Odgers submitted, was a matter properly to be taken into account, citing R v Jerrard (1991) 56 A Crim R 297. Mr Odgers also relied upon the fact that the applicant, being held at that prison, was largely deprived of contact with his daughter. He noted that, after sentence was passed, Judge Williams recommended that he be moved to a Sydney gaol to facilitate access to the child. 

12Mr Odgers referred to the plurality judgment in Hili at [40], where their Honours held that the determination of a recognisance release order in respect of a sentence for a Commonwealth offence should be guided by the principles identified in Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623, Deakin v The Queen (1984) 11 A Crim R 88 and Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525. The effect of those familiar decisions is that the setting of a non-parole period is governed not merely by considerations of rehabilitation, but must also reflect the need for retribution and deterrence. As their Honours went on to say in Hili at [41], one consideration in that case ""critical to the making of recognisance release orders was the determination of what was the period of imprisonment that justice required that each offender must serve in custody."" Nevertheless, Mr Odgers emphasised the ameliorative value of a non-parole period, in the interests of both the offender and the community, referred to in Bugmy in the majority judgment at 537 and in the dissenting judgment of Mason CJ and McHugh J at 531 - 2.

13Mr Odgers referred to the favourable aspects of the applicant's case and submitted that, in all the circumstances of the case, the ratio of the overall non-parole period to the total sentence of a little over 75% was ""simply too high.""

14It is clear from Judge Williams' remarks that he was aware of the issue of totality in the manner in which he structured the sentences. When dealing with the applicant, he said at [56]:

""As far as Thanh Dinh Phan is concerned there also needs to be a substantial element of specific deterrence given that these are two serious offences committed whilst on bail for similar behaviour of a similar level of seriousness but involving substantially lesser penalties on the previous occasion. In his case, however, having determined appropriate sentences for the two offences before me, I need to consider the question of cumulation of penalty for each offence, the question of cumulation on those sentences on his existing sentences and then look at the question of the overall totality. I agree that it would be inappropriate to impose a crushing sentence, that is, one without any degree of hope or rehabilitation.""

15While his Honour did not expressly refer to the non-parole period in that passage, I would not infer that he overlooked it. Since Hili it is clear that, subject to the principles developed by longstanding authority, the discretion of a sentencing judge in determining the proportion between sentence and non-parole period is at large. The applicant's criminality was of a high order and, notwithstanding the favourable features of his subjective case, it called for salutary punishment. An aggregate sentence cumulative upon the non-parole period the applicant was already serving was entirely appropriate, and the practical result of that accumulation was within the proper exercise of his Honour's discretion. The total sentence still leaves the applicant with a substantial period of parole eligibility, 4 years.

16I am not persuaded that his Honour fell into error in his approach to the matter. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

17HISLOP J: I agree with Hidden J.

		05 March 2013",2013-03-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761062,R v Philip LOUTAN [2013] NSWDC 101,"SENTENCE CORRECTION


1On 30 November 2012 I sentenced Philip Loutan to a period of 4 years and 9 months imprisonment. I took the unusual step of fixing an exceptionally low non-parole period. It was one that represented the 5 months or so that he had already spent in custody. That sentence reflected my clear intention, stated a number of times, that he should be released immediately. My reasons for having that intention are set out in previous judgments. Mr Loutan himself would clearly understand from what I had said to him in those judgments that he would be released immediately.

2Unfortunately what was overlooked by counsel and by me was that, in fixing a sentence of over 3 years, I do not have the power to fix the non parole period. That power lies with the Parole Authority, which of course is an independent body and exercises its own discretion. The error was picked up a few weeks after the sentence by the Corrective Services Department. That department pointed out the irregularity and the fact that Mr Loutan was at large when he should be in custody, because I had no power to grant him parole.

3Mr C. Eliopoulos, who appears for Mr Loutan, has applied to me to re open the sentence proceedings. I have that power under s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I have re-opened them. Mr Eliopoulos argues that in order to give effect to my intention I need to reduce his client's sentence to 3 years. Mr D. I. Curran, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, acknowledges that my intention in sentencing Mr Loutan was clear, and that this is quite an exceptional case so far as the offender's rehabilitation is concerned. He does not oppose, in those special circumstances, the course proposed by Mr Eliopoulos.

4There are two issues which concern me in re-opening the proceedings. One is that the power to re-open the proceedings may be exercised where I have ""imposed a penalty that is contrary to law"" or ""failed to impose a penalty that is required to be imposed by law"". 

5On one view there has been no legal error on my part. I have announced the sentence, and simply had no power to order that he be released on parole. However, the authorities have made it clear that the section is to be given a broad interpretation. It has been described as a remedial or beneficial provision which should be construed broadly. A court may re-sentence an offender entirely in order to produce the result which the sentencing judge originally intended to be achieved. I am of the view that I do have the power in those circumstances because my original intention was clearly frustrated in the sentence which I imposed.

6The second concern that I have is that I had assessed the appropriate sentences with respect to one of the supplies of a prohibited drug, being 113 ecstasy tablets, as being 4 years. I also assessed 4 years as being the appropriate sentence for the supply of 5 grams of cocaine. Clearly it seems to me that I overlooked, in assessing those sentences and in imposing the ultimate aggregate sentence, the fact that they would deprive me of the power to order Mr Loutan's release on immediate parole, which was my intention.

7I am aware that it is somewhat artificial for me to assess an appropriate sentence as 4 years and then to re-assess it as 3 years. Nevertheless I propose to do that in the circumstances of this case. There are two main reasons for that. One is that the result of the assessment is a frustration of my original intention in releasing Mr Loutan. The second reason is that Mr Loutan has been acting under the impression for a long time now that if he stayed out of trouble during adjournments, he would be released without any further custody. To my mind it would be a serious injustice to send him back into prison now.

8For those two reasons I propose to take the somewhat artificial course of indicating that the appropriate sentences for the two offences, one committed on 11 December 2004, the other committed on 21 December 2011, are 3 years. 

9I also formally re-open the proceedings under s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and under s 53A of that Act I impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to those offences of 3 years to commence on 10 December 2011 and to expire on 9 December 2014. The non-parole period remains at 5 months and 7 days, which commenced on 10 December 2011 and expired on 16 May 2012. The balance of the term is 2 years, 6 months and 23 days, which commenced on 17 May 2012, and will expire on 9 December 2014.

10Under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I make an order directing that Mr Loutan be released on parole forthwith. The conditions of the parole are these:

(1)That he be of good behaviour.

(2)That he keep the Parole Authority informed of his residential address.

(3)That he attend court if he receives notification to do so.

(4)That he accept all reasonable recommendations and directions of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service and accept their supervision, including any direction regarding intervention and monitoring regarding drug treatment, in particular random urinalysis.

11I direct that Mr Loutan present himself to the Probation and Parole Service office at Dee Why on or before next Friday 15 March 2013.

12I otherwise confirm the orders which I made on 30 November 2012.

HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Curran, Mr Eliopoulos, are there any other orders I need to make?
CURRAN: No, your Honour.
ELIOPOULOS: No, your Honour.

13Mr Loutan, you have heard that. I have given my reasons. I have had to re-assess the sentences as 3 years for the two drug supplies. As I said, somewhat artificial, but it was a major frustration of my intention, which, as I said, was that you be released forthwith, and also a serious injustice to you. 

14So that your sentence overall is now 3 years. It commenced, as we know, 10 December 2011 when you went into custody and it will expire now on 9 December 2014. So your sentence expires 9 December 2014 at the end of next year.

15The non-parole period is the same. It commenced on 10/12/11. It expired last year on 16 May, and you have been on parole since 17 May 2012 and that expires on 9 December 2014, when your sentence expires. 

16I have directed you to turn up to Dee Why on or before Friday of next week. The conditions are the same: stay out of trouble, keep them informed of your address. If you get a notice, turn up at court, do not be chased and accept those reasonable recommendations and directions and let them help you. Does that all make sense?

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. I understand.
HIS HONOUR: And how is it going?
OFFENDER: Very good.
HIS HONOUR: Still going well? Good. And you've got work somewhere else? You're not working as a chef, where are you working?
OFFENDER: No. I am so happy, I have a job, HMAS Kuttabul Navy Base.
HIS HONOUR: That's right, Kuttabul, good.
OFFENDER: I assist welders, and engineers, and yeah, I'm learning a lot, and I'm very happy.
HIS HONOUR: Have you got a trade in that?
OFFENDER: No, I'm actually a chef by trade.
HIS HONOUR: Your trade is a chef, I knew that you're a chef.
OFFENDER: That's right.
HIS HONOUR: So you're a welder's assistant, or something like that?
OFFENDER: Yes. I thought I'd give something different a go, and I'm very happy.
HIS HONOUR: That's good. All right, Mr Loutan, that's very good.
I have made the parole order, so I do not think I need to do anything else. I will sign the order, which will go downstairs. Keep up the good work, Mr Loutan.
OFFENDER: Thank you, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Thank you both for your assistance.

		03 July 2013",2013-03-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761079,Brown v R [2013] NSWCCA 44,"Judgment
1BATHURST CJ:  I agree with the orders proposed by Fullerton J and with her Honour's reasons.
2FULLERTON J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Maiden DCJ on 17 August 2012 for the supply of a prohibited drug, namely 16.4 grams of methylamphetamine, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 
3The maximum penalty for that offence is 15 years imprisonment.  Each of the three related offences the subject of a s 166 certificate carried maximum penalties of 2 years imprisonment. 
4After allowing a discount of 25 per cent for the plea of guilty and a finding of special circumstances, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months to date from 6 June 2012 and to expire on 5 November 2014 with a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months to expire on 5 February 2016.  His Honour dealt with three related offences on the s 166 certificate under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
The facts
5On 26 May 2011 the applicant booked into a room at the Aloha Motor Inn at Merewether in Newcastle.  While he was absent from the room, a member of staff entered the room and discovered what appeared to be illicit drugs together with other drug paraphernalia.  The police were informed and attended with a search warrant.  Police located $5020 in cash bundled into lots of $1000 together with five resealable bags, three of which contained the methylamphetamine, the subject of the supply charge.  The remaining two bags contained cannabis, the subject of the first offence on the s 166 certificate.  Traces of a white crystalline substance and two loose pieces of cannabis were also located in the room together with scales, mobile telephones, plastic bags and containers indicative of drug supply. 
6The applicant returned to the room during the search at which time he was found in possession of $1620 which, together with the money already located in the room, was the second of the offences on the s 166 certificate.  Also located was a document containing a list of names and numbers, three resealable bags containing traces of methylamphetamine and an orange tablet later found to be morphine, which was the third offence on the s 166 certificate. 
7The applicant was arrested and remanded in custody.
8On 5 August 2011 he was released to bail on condition that he enter into the residential rehabilitation program at the Bennelong Haven Rehabilitation Centre at Kempsey (""the Bennelong Centre""), that he was not to leave the institution until the completion of the rehabilitation course otherwise than for the purposes of attending court or the offices of his legal representatives, and that he obey all lawful instructions of the program supervisors.  The applicant remained a full-time resident at the Bennelong Centre until 18 November 2011, a period of 105 days. 
9On 17 November 2011 the applicant's bail was varied on condition that he transfer to a residential rehabilitation program conducted by the Australian Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (ACADD) at their facility in Newcastle (""the ACADD Facility"").  He remained a full-time resident of the Family Drug and Alcohol Recovery program operated from that facility for a period of 152 days.  On 19 April 2012 the applicant's bail was varied, on this occasion to permit him to participate in the transitional program run by ACADD and to reside at an address in Toukley for a period of 120 days whilst a participant in that community-based program.  He remained subject to that bail condition until the date of sentence on 17 August 2012.
Grounds of appeal
10The notice of appeal cited two grounds:(1) The sentencing judge erred by failing to allow the applicant a discount upon his sentence for the quasi-custody served in rehabilitation. 
(2) The sentencing judge erred by failing to have regard to the applicant's mental health condition. 
11On the appeal, counsel for the applicant advised that Ground 2 of the appeal would not be pressed in light of the Crown's concession that the sentencing judge was in error by failing to take into consideration, in the applicant's favour, the time spent in both residential rehabilitation centres and that it would be necessary for this Court to move to re-sentence. 
Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred by failing to allow the applicant a discount upon his sentence for the quasi-custody served in rehabilitation  
12The applicant tendered on sentence documentary evidence relating to the rehabilitation programs conducted at both residential facilities, together with reports on his progress as a participant in those programs.
13A letter from Ms Morris, Administration Assistant at the Bennelong Centre, detailed the progress of the applicant whilst a participant in the program conducted from that Centre, summarised as follows:(i) His adherence to rules was good; general demeanour pleasant; attitude to chores good; speaking at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings very good; interaction with others good and attitude to rehabilitation good;
(ii) He demonstrated a willingness to change and accept advice, he attended all meetings, activities and groups held at this Centre; and
(iii) He returned five negative drug tests.
14The evidence concerning the operations of the Bennelong Centre also established that residents of that Centre are not permitted to leave for the first three months and thereafter only with the permission of staff members.  In addition, residents are subject to supervised random drug and alcohol testing and any breach of the rules can result in the loss of privileges or discharge from the program.  
15Evidence tendered at sentence relating to the residential program conducted at the ACADD Facility indicated that in a regime similar to that which operates at the Bennelong Centre, participants are required to:(i) Attend a minimum of five meetings of 12 step programs per week (under supervision);
(ii) Attend domestic violence course and relationship counselling; 
...
(v) Participate in all in-house groups and meetings; 
...
16Additional documents tendered on sentence from Christa Bidgood, Founder and Program Co-ordinator of the ACADD Facility advised that:(i) The Centre has three live-in managers available at all times and has nine security cameras monitoring the facility.  There are restricted times that a client can leave to shop for personal needs otherwise they may only leave for medical, Probation and Parole Service and Job Network appointments. 
(ii) Weekend activities and leave must be approved by staff and only family visitors are allowed in after their belongings are searched.
(iii) Regular room checks and random drug tests are conducted.  
(iv) Swearing and raised voices are disciplined.   
17As to the applicant's progress whilst a participant in the program Ms Bidgood advised in a letter dated 4 April 2012:In total [the applicant] has achieved 8 months recovery from active addiction.
...
This has significantly changed [his] attitudes toward his past life to develop a new and healthier outlook on life.  [He] is ready to meet his responsibilities to set up a family home with his partner... 
18In a letter dated 1 August 2012 she reported:...[The applicant] was assessed on his voluntary request to extend his recovery and continue with a more intense program to gain greater stability and foundation to recovery [from his drug addiction]...
...[The applicant] now blends into the community as a responsible and upstanding citizen in the community.
19In his sentencing remarks, his Honour referred to the material from the ACADD Facility stating that:Having read the material from ACADD initially and with the further material that was tendered on the last occasion, I am unable to find that, in fact, the offender was in quasi custody, simply on those authorities.
The establishments that the Court has accepted that would be considered an offender being in quasi custody have or must be equated to a prison environment.  This particular establishment does not appear to have that regime.
20While his Honour did not refer directly to the evidence relating to the Bennelong Centre, his remarks appear to be directed towards the residential rehabilitation programs participated in by the applicant at both facilities. 
21In expressing the view that any quasi-custody must be equated to a prison environment, his Honour did not refer to any authorities nor, it seems, was he referred to Renshaw v R [2012] NSWCCA 91 where Hoeben J reviewed the collected authorities as to the relevance of quasi-custody on sentence as follows:[30] In Regina v Campbell [1999] NSWCCA 76 Kirby J (with whom Grove J agreed) said on a similar issue:
""24 The last complaint was the failure by his Honour to take account of the time spent by the applicant undergoing rehabilitation. It was appropriate that the applicant should have received recognition, and credit for the time spent in rehabilitation. In R v Eastway (CCA, unreported, 19 May 1992), the Court consisting of Gleeson CJ, Hunt CJ at CL and Mathews J, identified the reasons for doing so. The rehabilitation courses are residential. Persons who undergo them are subject to discipline and restrictions. The Court determined, in that case, that the prisoner should be given credit for half the time spent in rehabilitation. In some cases the proportion has been somewhat higher, as high as 75 percent.
25 Here his Honour did not advert to this aspect, although unquestionably his Honour was aware that the applicant had undergone rehabilitation. It is not apparent from his remarks on sentence that credit was given to the applicant for time spent in rehabilitation. This was an important matter which ought not to have been left to inference. Therefore, I am prepared to find there was error, justifying intervention by this Court, and the setting aside of the sentence. I would therefore give leave to appeal.""
[31] In R v Delaney [2003] NSWCCA 342 James J (with whom Santow JA agreed, Barr J dissenting) said: 
""19 It was submitted before this Court on behalf of the applicant that her Honour had erred in refusing to take into account the periods the applicant had spent in The Salvation Army programs.
20 Counsel for the applicant referred to decisions of this Court in R v Eastway (unreported 19 May 1992) especially at pp 6 to 7 per Hunt CJ at CL; R v Campbell (unreported 12 April 1999) especially per Kirby J at paras 24 and 25; R v Thompson (unreported [2000] 362) especially per James J at [30].
.... 
22 In my opinion, her Honour did err in refusing to take into account the time which the applicant had spent in The Salvation Army programs. The programs both in Sydney and Canberra were residential programs. In his letter of 4 April 2002 Major Harmer referred to the strict discipline expected of clients who enter the William Booth program and in his affidavit of 10 November 2003 Major Harmer reiterated that The Salvation Army program is very strict. The letter from Mr Fairhall listed the activities comprised in the program in which the applicant was participating, including carrying out regular community and housekeeping chores as required. In my opinion, the conditions of the residential programs in which the applicant was participating amounted to conditions of quasi-custody.""
[32] Similarly, in Hughes v R [2008] NSWCCA 48 Grove J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed) said:
""37 Ground 1 is focussed upon the pre-sentence entry by the applicant into rehabilitation programmes. He was in a residential programme conducted by WHOS for twenty days but he transferred to the Salvation Army Bridge Programme in order to avail himself of the one-to-one counselling available there. A letter from Mr Muendel, the Director, indicated his good response to that programme and suggested that it might profitably be completed, however his Honour declined to permit adjournment for that purpose so that the applicant participated in the latter programme from 12 December 2006 until he was committed into custody on 13 February 2007. It would appear then, that the applicant lived within the confines of residential rehabilitation facilities for about 103 days. It is apparent from Mr Muendel's report and his Honour's findings that the applicant made beneficial use of his opportunities.
38 It is appropriate for an offender to receive recognition and credit for time spent in rehabilitation which has been productive: R v Eastaway (unreported, NSWCCA 19 May 1992). An allowance of approximately 50 percent of the credit that would be given in respect of pre-sentence custody has been endorsed: R v Douglas (unreported, NSWCCA 4 March 1997). Pre-sentence custody and the similar concept of rehabilitation ""custody"" is preferably catered for by backdating of the commencement date of sentence: R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588. What is here involved is therefore a potential backdating of a little over fifty days. I would reject the Crown submission that this ground should be rejected because that period is de minimis.""
22I am satisfied that the residential rehabilitation program in which the applicant participated is indistinguishable from that with which this Court was concerned in Renshaw, R v Campbell [1999] NSWCCA 76 and Hughes v R [2008] NSWCCA 48; 185 A Crim R 155 and, accordingly, that the sentencing judge was in error in failing to acknowledge the rehabilitation undertaken by the applicant as quasi-custody.   
23In Campbell, the Court was satisfied that error resulted from the failure of the sentencing judge to take into consideration the 12 months the applicant had spent in residential rehabilitation while in Hughes, 103 days in residential rehabilitation was taken into account on re-sentence by backdating the sentence.    
24On re-sentence, the applicant's counsel submitted a discretionary range of between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of the actual time spent in residential rehabilitation, based on the circumstances of the individual case, was expressly recognised as allowable in Campbell at [24].
25In Truss v R [2008] NSWCCA 325, the applicant had spent six months in quasi-custody before being discharged for returning a positive drug test.  Notwithstanding, Latham J allowed for a reduction equivalent to 50 per cent of the time spent in quasi-custody on being satisfied that the treatment in the program had yielded a successful, albeit not a sustained result.   
26In R v Marschall [2002] NSWCCA 197; 129 A Crim R 381 Smart AJ referred to the sentencing considerations that should be taken when determining the extent of a reduction on account of time spent in quasi-custody, namely the applicant's participation in, and the benefit derived from residential rehabilitation, even if in qualified terms, was relevant in determining the discount which would be applied in the sentencing exercise.  His Honour held at [30] that:...Whether any credit should be given and the amount of any credit will depend on all the circumstances, including that the treatment has not yielded a successful result...
27In this case, I am satisfied that the extended period of residential rehabilitation (totalling 257 days) in which the applicant participated without blemish or breach, coupled with the content of the pre-sentence report dated 2 August 2012, both of which confirmed that the applicant successfully completed both residential rehabilitation programs, and his successful transition to a community-based rehabilitation program (including regular attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings) has demonstrated a level of determination to abstain from his illicit drug use.  In addressing what he recognised as the motivating cause of his drug offending, the risk of his future offending may be significantly reduced.  For these reasons I am satisfied he is entitled to a discounted sentence at the top of the available discretionary range. 
28I am conscious of the need to ensure that in applying a sentence reduction of the time spent in quasi-custody that the resulting sentence does not fail to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence (see R v Delaney [2003] NSWCCA 342; 59 NSWLR 1). 
29On re-sentence I am guided by the decision of Street CJ in R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588, referred to more recently by Grove J in Hughes at [38] as to the approach to best achieve that result.  I propose to backdate the commencement date of the sentence imposed against the applicant by a period of 193 days (being 75 per cent of 257 days). 
30The orders I propose are as follows:
1. Grant leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on 17 August 2012.
2. Allow the appeal.
3. Vary the sentence imposed on 17 August 2012 by directing that the non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months commence on 26 November 2011 and to expire on 25 May 2014 and otherwise confirm the sentencing orders. 
31BEECH JONES J:  I agree with Fullerton J and the orders her Honour proposes.

2761080,Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Steadman [2013] NSWSC 170,"Judgment

1The plaintiff moves upon an amended summons seeking an extended supervision order (""the order"") with regard to the defendant pursuant to the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (""the Act"").

2The defendant was represented by a solicitor and counsel at the hearing. It was made clear that the defendant does not wish to be heard against the propositions that various necessary matters fall within the definitions contained in the Act; that the test in the legislation that is a precondition for the making of such an order has been made out; and that the order should be made. The only point of dispute between the parties requiring determination by me is as to the duration of the order. The plaintiff submits that it should be for 5 years. The defendant submits that it should be for 3 years. Due to the fact that, in truth, the only matter in dispute is whether the order should extend for an extra 24 months, I can be briefer than if the making of the order were comprehensively disputed by the defendant.

3A number of minor disputes between the parties as to the precise conditions of the order were resolved before and during the hearing. After the end of the hearing, the plaintiff filed on 4 March 2013 an amended schedule that reflects the resolution of those disputes and contains the precise conditions of any order that I would make.

Review of evidence

Convictions

4The defendant was born in March 1994, and has just turned 69. He was first convicted of a criminal offence in 1953, when he was dealt with for three charges of stealing in a Children's Court. In August 1958, when he was aged 14, he was charged with indecent assault on a female aged six years, found guilty, and committed to an institution. The facts of that offence are not now available. Since then he has been convicted of a number of sexual offences against many female children.

5In 1960, he was convicted of a common assault against an 11 year old girl committed when he was aged 16 years. The charge took that form, but the underlying facts had an undeniable sexual flavour. The facts are that the defendant confronted the victim at the front door of her home. He entered the home with his penis exposed. He grabbed the victim and attempted to push her into a bedroom. She was able to free herself and scream help. He grabbed her again, and placed both hands on her throat. The defendant was committed to an institution for that offence. 

6In 1993, he was convicted of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent in the District Court of New South Wales at Lismore after a trial by jury. The victim was a girl aged 11 years. She was the young friend of the daughter of a woman with whom the defendant was living. The facts were that, during one evening when the victim was sleeping over at the home of the defendant, he placed his hand down the front of her underpants and inserted one of his fingers into her vagina. The sentencing judge was unable to determine whether the offence was committed on the spur of the moment, or had been the subject of some planning. His Honour found that there had been a breach of trust. The defendant was sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years 8 months with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 2 years. 

7In 2009 in the District Court of New South Wales at Tamworth, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated indecent assault upon a person under the age of 16 and two counts of indecent assault upon persons under 10. Taken into account on a Form 1 was a charge of possessing child pornography.

8There were three separate female victims, two aged 9 years, and one aged 10 years. They were the ""step granddaughters"" of the defendant. The offences were committed between February and May 2007. With regard to the first offence, the defendant touched the genitals of the victim whilst her parents were absent. There was evidence of the defendant telling the victim to tell no one, and also promising her ""treats"". With regard to the second offence, the defendant touched the genitals of the victim on a trip to a local council tip. There was a degree of planning, because the defendant asked the victim not to wear any underpants before embarking on the journey. On the same occasion, the defendant requested that the victim take photographs of his penis. The third count was founded on the fact that the defendant fondled the genitals of the victim whilst she was lying on a seat in his van. At least some of the child pornography was generated by the defendant himself from his interactions with the victims. 

9The defendant received a total head sentence of imprisonment for 5 years 5 months with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 4 years 2 months. The sentencing judge noted that the defendant displayed little appreciation of the seriousness of what he had done and was not entitled to leniency in light of his record. His Honour recommended that the defendant receive treatment in prison.

10For reasons that will become clear shortly, the defendant was not released on parole at the end of the non-parole period of that sentence. Indeed, he remained in custody until shortly before the expiry of the total head sentence. He was released to parole on 10 September 2012. The sentence expired in its entirety on 10 December 2012. Since that date the defendant has been subject to interim orders pursuant to the Act.

11The defendant has a long record for offences that are not of a sexual nature. None of them are of the greatest seriousness.

Allegations

12Quite apart from the offences of which the defendant has been convicted, there have been various other allegations of sexual crimes against three other children. It has been asserted at various times over the years that he committed offences in March 1993, February 1999, and between May and August 2007. With regard to the latter allegation, the defendant was acquitted at trial in the District Court of New South Wales. Finally, an intellectually disabled woman has claimed that the defendant sexually assaulted her. None of these allegations resulted in convictions.

Personal circumstances of the defendant

13Since his release to parole on 10 September 2012 the defendant has been living in a halfway house for released prisoners at Malabar. It is not a therapeutic community. It seems that he has not breached his parole, or the interim orders, or any Child Protection Order, since his release. More generally, he has complied with conditions of parole in the past. 

14The defendant has no friends or family with whom he is in contact. He has no contact with his three former wives, and his surviving sister wishes to have nothing to do with him.

15The plans of the defendant for the future are unclear, but include living a quiet life somewhere in country New South Wales. He does not wish to live in Sydney, due, he says, to its association in his mind with the Granville train disaster in 1977, in which he was involved. Although he has held a number of unskilled positions over the years, he does not propose to work, and is in receipt of the age pension. He enjoys gardening.

16He has no issues with drugs or alcohol. He has never been diagnosed with a major psychiatric disorder. He suffers from high blood pressure for which he is medicated, some loss of hearing, and a bad back. For a man of his age, his health is good.

Attitudes of the defendant

17The various positions of the defendant with regard to the offences of which he has been convicted are that he cannot remember the matter; that he has been the subject of false allegations based on ill-feeling towards him; or that he has pleaded guilty under pressure from incompetent lawyers.

18The defendant has no, or virtually no, insight into his long-standing proclivity to commit sexual crimes against young girls. Although he has been prepared to seek treatment with regard to claimed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (""PTSD""), said to have arisen from his involvement in the train disaster, he has refused treatment with regard to that proclivity. That is the case both when he has been in custody and when he has been at liberty in the community. It is noteworthy that the material before me reveals that the defendant adamantly refused treatment when he was still a boy in 1960, well over half a century ago. 

19The sole exception to the attitude of the defendant that has been maintained over many decades is as follows. Before being sentenced in 2009, the defendant saw a probation and parole officer for the preparation of a pre-sentence report dated 3 April 2009. In that report, it is said:

""Mr. Stanton [as the defendant was then known] was initially closed to conversation in relation to his offending. He did, however, arrive at a point of admission of his offending and his inability to control ""the urges"" that he had in relation to his sexual offending. He admitted he needed assistance in addressing his offending behaviour and indicated he was willing to undertake programs specifically to address this area of criminogenic need."" 

Later, the defendant denied that he had ever met the author of that report. 

20It is true that, in late 2011 and early 2012, the defendant attended a program designed to increase motivation and readiness to engage in a sexual offenders program. However, in summary, during that attendance the defendant did nothing to address the real issue.

21In short there is a complete and long-standing lack of insight into the issue, and an entrenched refusal to seek to deal with it. 

22As at the date of the hearing, it seems that the defendant was not prepared to take anti-libidinal medication. A dispute between the parties as to orders in that regard was resolved. The position of the plaintiff is that there should not be an order that the defendant take such medication unless he consents to doing so.

23Finally with regard to the attitudes of the defendant, it is to say the least of concern that, in the mid 1990s, the pre-release plans of the defendant included involving himself in Camp Quality, a well-known charity directed towards helping children suffering from cancer.

Recent psychological and psychiatric reports

24Although there have been a large number of reports written about the defendant over many years, it is only necessary to refer to three of them in detail. A psychologist evaluated the defendant shortly before his release, and two psychiatrists recently saw the defendant pursuant to a court order for the purpose of these proceedings.

25Mr Sheehan is a senior specialist psychologist within Corrective Services New South Wales. He saw the defendant on 6 and 7 June 2012, and prepared a report of 21 June 2012. That document is very much directed towards a risk assessment of the defendant.

26With regard to actuarial assessment by way of Static 99, a well-known instrument for indicating the risk of sexual recidivism, Mr Sheehan placed the defendant in the ""moderate-high risk category"".

27With regard to dynamic risk factors, Mr Sheehan noted that there were five domains: sexual violence history, psychological adjustment, mental disorder, social adjustment and manageability. Mr Sheehan expressed the opinion that the defendant had ""exhibited relevant risk factors in all five domains"".

28In short, Mr Sheehan expressed the opinion that ""the overall totality of evidence suggests that Mr Steadman remains in the moderate-high risk category of sexual offending relative to other adult male sexual offenders.""

29As for what would be envisaged if the defendant were to be in the community subject to an order, Mr Sheehan referred to a requirement that the defendant live in one place and not travel spontaneously, a monitoring of his social contacts, limitation on his access to vulnerable children, and the encouragement of an appropriate lifestyle that could extend beyond supervision.

30Doctor Allnutt saw the defendant on 27 November 2012, and prepared a report shortly thereafter, the salient feature of which were as follows.

31The history to which I have referred above was reviewed by the doctor. Dr Allnutt noted that, at the time of the interview, the defendant expressed a preparedness to seek treatment for any sexual problems he may have. He claimed that his sex drive was diminished.

32Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that, based on the history given, the defendant is indeed suffering from PTSD.

33In considering the risk of further offending in the future, Dr Allnutt placed emphasis on a number of factors. First, the sexual offending of the defendant commenced when he was 14 years of age, and is last proven to have occurred when he was 63 years of age. Secondly, the offending has taken a number of forms, including digital penetration, fellatio, and obtaining pornographic photographs of his victims. The offences also on occasion featured the use of force. Thirdly, the offences have occurred in public and private places. Fourthly, access to the victims has been achieved in a variety of ways, including as stranger, acquaintance and step-grandfather.

34With regard to actuarial assessment of the risk of future offending, Dr Allnutt also used Static 99. He emphasised that it is to be used as a guide only. Dr Allnutt noted that, if one does not take into account as an ameliorative factor the advanced age of the defendant (a possible approach, in light of the fact that he committed the last set of offences at the age of 63), the defendant would be at a high risk of re-offending. If one takes into account the age of the defendant, then he would be, according to Static 99, at a higher than average risk of re-offending.

35Finally, Dr Allnutt took into account that it seems that, in the future, the defendant will maintain a position of outright denial, or, at least, minimisation of his sexual offending against young girls. Dr Allnutt also referred to isolation as a factor that significantly increases the risk of re-offending.

36In short, Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that:

""He manifests a long term propensity to serious sexual offending that requires monitoring at this stage; there are a number of current factors that perpetuate his risk, predominantly because he has not yet engaged in a therapeutic and rehabilitation program, some of which are ambiguous due to his limited self-report; he has some protective factors predominantly his capacity to engage in rehabilitation should [he] choose to engage.""

37With regard to the length of any order, Dr Allnutt was reluctant to express an opinion, on the basis that that was a legal question that involves a restriction upon liberty.

38Doctor Roberts saw the defendant on 26 November 2012 and prepared a report dated 11 December 2012. He cast doubt on the existence of PTSD relating to the train disaster. He noted, for example, that in the past the defendant had indicated a readiness not only to be near railway stations and lines but even to be a passenger on trains. He emphasised that the last offences were committed when the defendant was 63 years of age, and was cautious in those circumstances about regarding his current age as a protective factor. He diagnosed the defendant as suffering from ""Paedophilia, Sexually Attracted to Females"", and expressed the expectation that that diagnosis will persist indefinitely.

39Dr Roberts contended that the risk of re-offending fell within the moderate to high range, and at the higher end of that range. Dr Roberts expressed the view that the defendant is either insightless, or in denial, or dishonest. He expressed the opinion that any order should be of the maximum duration. He said:

""It is therefore expected that unsupervised, Mr Steadman would not be motivated to take any steps whatsoever to mitigate what would ordinarily be considered to represent circumstances which have the potential to place him at high risk of inappropriate sexual contact with children.""


Submissions of the plaintiff

40As I have indicated, by the time of the hearing before me there was a simple, discrete point of dispute between the parties that required determination. The plaintiff made eight submissions in support of the proposition that the order should be for 5 years.

41First, the conditions proposed do not constitute an overly burdensome restriction upon the liberty of the defendant.

42Secondly, if the defendant is compliant, one would expect the conditions to be substantially less onerous at the end of the period of 5 years than they were at the beginning.

43Thirdly, Dr Allnutt was not prepared to express a firm opinion either way. In contrast, Dr Roberts was unequivocal that the order should be for the maximum period.

44Fourthly, it seems that the defendant will not currently consent to taking anti-libidinal medication, a necessary pre-condition of him receiving it.

45Fifthly, it is clear that the defendant will be socially isolated. He will probably be physically isolated as well, bearing in mind his desire to live in the country. That will increase the prospect of re-offending.

46Sixthly, merely because the plaintiff has the ability to seek further supervision of the defendant in the future is no reason not to make an order for five years now, if that is the appropriate order on the evidence.

47Seventhly, there is a real risk, it was submitted, that the defendant will inveigle himself into the life of a person who is close to children. That could be, for example, an older person who has grandchildren. It is noteworthy that that is precisely how the defendant committed the offences for which he was sentenced in 2009.

48Eighthly and finally, it was submitted that, whilst rehabilitation is a purpose of the Act, the primary purpose is the protection of the community. 

49In short it was submitted that, in all the circumstances, an order for 5 years was warranted.

Submissions of the defendant

50In response, six submissions were made. 

51First, the period of 3 years to which consent is effectively being given is not an insubstantial one. 

52Secondly, one should not forget that there will be continuous practical restrictions upon the liberty of the defendant. 

53Thirdly, counsel for the defendant submitted that it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to demonstrate that the order should extend for 5 years, as opposed to it being incumbent upon the defendant to demonstrate that it should exist for only 3 years.

54Fourthly, based on past history, it seems likely that the defendant will be compliant with any such order, whatever its length. 

55Fifthly, the conditions of the order will themselves guard against the defendant having an opportunity to develop relationships that will provide him with access to children.

56Sixthly, and perhaps most importantly, there is no restriction upon the plaintiff in the future seeking to vary an existing order of 3 years, including as to its duration, or indeed seeking a further order for a substantial period towards the end of the initial order. 

57In short it was submitted that a period of 3 years is, at least at this stage, sufficient.

The statute

58The objects of the Act are set out in s 3:

""Objects of Act

(1) The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community.

(2) Another object of this Act is to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation.""

59The test contained in ss 9(2)-(2A) of the Act is as follows:

""Determination of application for extended supervision order

...

(2) An extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(2A) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence.""

60Section 9(3) of the Act contains a list of matters to which I must have regard before determining whether to make the order sought by the plaintiff. It is convenient to set those matters out as follows:

""Determination of application for extended supervision order

...

(3) In determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant: 

(a) the safety of the community,

(b) the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7 (4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender's participation in any such examination,

(c) the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender's participation in any such assessment,

(d) the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further serious sex offence,

(d1) any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community,

(e) any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender's participation in any such programs,

(f) the level of the offender's compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order,

(g) the level of the offender's compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004,

(h) the offender's criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,

(h1) the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender,

(i) any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature.""

61Section 13 of the Act is as follows:

""Supervision order may be varied or revoked

(1) The Supreme Court may at any time vary or revoke an extended supervision order or interim supervision order on the application of the State of New South Wales or the offender.

(1A) The period of an order must not be varied so that the period is greater than that otherwise permitted under this Part.

(2) For the purpose of ascertaining whether to make such an application in relation to an extended supervision order, the Commissioner of Corrective Services must provide the Attorney General with a report on the offender at intervals of not more than 12 months.""


Determination - making the order

62Although the defendant does not oppose the making of an order, and made no submissions seeking to persuade me not do so, I have applied my own independent judgment to the question.

63The offences of which the defendant was convicted in 2009 fall within the definition of a ""serious sex offence"" in s 5 of the Act.

64The plaintiff has complied with the various procedures set out in s 6 of the Act with regard to an application for an order.

65I have approached the requirement of satisfaction ""to a high degree of probability"" as constituting an elevated standard of proof that falls between the criminal standard and the civil standard, in accordance with Tillman v Attorney General for the State of New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 327; (2007) 178 A Crim R 133.

66As for what is involved in the concept of ""unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence"" I respectfully adopt what was said by Davies J in State of New South Wales v Richardson (No. 2) [2011] NSWSC 276 at [90]:

""Two things seem to me significant when assessing the evidence and the likelihood of re-offending. The first is the higher standard of proof imposed by the words ""a high degree of probability"". The second is the notion that ""unacceptable risk"" involves a balancing exercise between the commission of a serious sexual offence and the likelihood of that risk coming to fruition on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the Defendant either because he will be detained beyond the period of his sentence although he has not committed any further offence or he will be subject to an onerous supervision order, on the other hand. It is because of that balancing exercise that it is open to the Court to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that there is an unacceptable risk but that the result of that finding (either a continuing detention order or a supervision order) may vary in a given situation. That is also because s 17(3) provides for the further assessment that if the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk a supervision order will not be adequate to meet the risk.""

That analysis is equally applicable to the test contained in s 9(2), as the words of s 17(3) and s 9(2) are identical. 

67I have made an independent assessment of all of the factors in s 9(3) of the Act. I do not propose to advert to the factor in each of the sub-paragraphs seriatim, because I consider that I have dealt with each of them in the judgment as a whole.

68I am satisfied that the defendant has a chronic tendency to commit sexual offences against female children that has existed for well over 50 years. I come to that conclusion even though there was a break of substantial duration in the proven offending of the defendant. That tendency puts the safety of the public at risk. 

69I accept the diagnosis of Dr Roberts that the defendant suffers from paedophilia, characterised by sexual attraction to female children. 

70With regard to the attitude of the defendant to that condition, I am satisfied that he either denies its existence, or accepts its existence and is happy with it and has no desire to change it. Either way, as a result of his entrenched position, he has received no treatment for it.

71The age of the defendant is relevant but, in light of the offending when he was 63 years of age, hardly determinative as to whether he is likely to re-offend. I do not consider that the lifelong sexual attraction to young girls of the defendant has dissipated with age. I consider that he may well seek to act upon his sexual attraction to young girls in the future. 

72I consider that there is certainly a risk to the community that the defendant may inveigle himself into sustained contact with children, either directly or (perhaps more likely) indirectly by way of, for example, a relationship of friendship or affection with an older person with grandchildren, and take the opportunity to commit serious sexual offences against them.

73In short, with regard to the test contained in s 9(2) of the Act, as supplemented by s 9(2A) of the same Act, I am ""satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if [he] is not kept under supervision."" 

74It follows that I propose to make an extended supervision order with regard to the defendant. The conditions will be those in the amended schedule to which I referred at [3] and which is attached to this judgment. 

Determination - length of order

Review of cases

75It is convenient to review briefly some recent cases in which the length of an order arose as a discrete point for determination. Of course, each case will turn to a large degree on its own facts.

76In State of New South Wales v Bastian [2011] NSWSC 641, the plaintiff sought an extended supervision order for a period of 3 years. The experts had reached divergent conclusions, one expert opining that a period of 3 years was appropriate and the other recommending that a period of 5 years was required. In the course of determining that an appropriate duration of the order was 3 years, Hoeben J said the following at [64] - [65]:

""As both the psychiatrists acknowledge, the defendant's risk is chronic. Notwithstanding his age, his libido is high and he continues to fantasise about young boys. In light of the evidence of the court appointed psychiatrists as to his physical health, the State now seeks an order for extended supervision of 3 years. 

I am satisfied that an order of 3 years would facilitate monitoring and review of the defendant's risk as suggested by Dr Ellis. There is then a further 6 months period for review and consolidation or, if necessary, a further application under the Act.""

77In State of New South Wales v Conway [2011] NSWSC 925, an extended supervision order was made for a period of 3 years. That order was made in circumstances where the plaintiff had sought an order for 5 years and the defendant contended for the lesser period of 3 years. Despite expert opinion to the contrary of the period ultimately imposed, Hidden J observed the following at [28]:

""Nevertheless, as [the expert] properly observed, this decision is a legal one, not a clinical one. After careful consideration, I am persuaded by [counsel for the defendant's] submission that 3 years is a significant period in which to monitor the defendant in the community, and provide significant scope for professional intervention. That lesser period, in my view, would provide a greater incentive for the defendant to pursue his rehabilitation and, in particular, to commit himself genuinely to treatment.""

78In State of New South Wales v De La Torre [2011] NSWSC 1263, the defendant did not oppose the making of an order, but submitted that it should only be for 3 years. However, the experts that were appointed by the Court both agreed that it was appropriate in that case that an extended supervision order be for a period of 5 years. In those circumstances, Garling J ordered that the extended supervision order be for a period of 5 years.

79In State of New South Wales v Darrego [2011] NSWSC 1449, the plaintiff sought an order for a period of 5 years, and the defendant submitted that it should be for a period of 3 years. In that case, the experts were not unanimous in their recommendations as to the length of any extended supervision order. Ultimately, Fullerton J imposed an extended supervision order for a period of 5 years whilst noting at [87]:

""The question of the duration of a supervision order was specifically posed for each of the court-appointed psychiatrists. Ultimately, however, the question whether a five-year term or some shorter term should be imposed is a question for the Court. Unlike the psychiatrists, I am obliged to take in to consideration a number of competing considerations in determining the appropriate length of the supervision order, with all of the limitations inherent in a predictive exercise of that kind.""

80In State of New South Wales v Scerri [2012] NSWSC 271, the plaintiff sought an order for a period of 5 years, whereas the defendant contended for an order for a period of 3 years. Adams J ultimately imposed an order for a period of 3 years despite observing at [34] that ""[m]y expectation is, as indeed the doctors opine, that it will be in all the likelihood necessary to extend it"". 

Resolution

81The submissions of the plaintiff have a degree of force. It seems that the defendant will be very socially isolated, and perhaps geographically isolated as well. He has set his face against receiving treatment for his profoundly antisocial condition. There is a risk that he will be able to manipulate himself into a position where he has access to children.

82On the other hand, 3 years is not a period of short duration. The conditions of the order that I will make are a significant erosion of the liberty of the defendant. Nothing precludes the plaintiff from applying to amend such an order during its duration, including as to its length. Nor does anything preclude the plaintiff from seeking a further order of substantial length towards the end of the order I will make. At that stage the position as to the need for extension will be clearer than it is today. Whilst I accept that those processes, if necessary, will involve time, trouble, and expense, and those considerations deserve to be given some weight, they are not determinative.

83Considering the purposes of the Act, taking into account all of the evidence, and balancing the competing positions of the parties, I propose to make the order, and it will expire 3 years from today.

2761081,"MARTIN, Alexandra Jane v R [2013] NSWCCA 24","Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: For the reasons given by Beech-Jones J, I joined in the making of the orders on 7 February 2013.

2FULLERTON J: I agree with Beech-Jones J.

3BEECH-JONES J: On 24 May 2012 the appellant, Alexandra Jane Martin, appeared before the District Court and maintained her plea of guilty to a single charge of break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence, namely assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to s 112(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence was committed on 10 December 2011. The sentence hearing was adjourned until 30 May 2012. On that date the appellant was convicted. She was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 15 months, comprised of a non-parole period of 6 months commencing on 30 May 2012 and expiring on 29 November 2012 with a balance of term of nine months set to expire on 29 August 2013. 

4On 25 June 2012 the appellant filed an application for leave to appeal against her sentence. On 17 July 2012 she was granted bail pending the hearing of her application for leave to appeal (R v Alexandra Jane Martin [2012] NSWSC 801). The bail conditions required her, inter alia, to report to the police three times per week and to be of good behaviour. There was no suggestion that she did not comply with those conditions. 

5The application for leave to appeal was listed before this Court on 7 February 2012. At the conclusion of argument the Court made orders granting the application for leave to appeal, allowing the appeal and setting aside the orders of the District Court made on 30 May 2012. In lieu of those orders the Court directed the applicant to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of six months pursuant to s 9(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the ""Sentencing Act""). 

6These are my reasons for joining in the Court's orders. 

Circumstances of the offences

7Tendered before the sentencing judge was an agreed statement of facts. The events disclosed in the agreed statement of facts were supplemented by evidence given by the appellant before the sentencing judge. The sentencing judge accepted her evidence. 

8On the evening of 9 December 2011 the appellant and her then boyfriend were socialising with friends. The appellant had been seeing her boyfriend for over two years. She lived with him and his family. 

9After drinking cocktails at a local RSL club the group moved to a nearby hotel. The appellant and her boyfriend became involved in an argument. He became violent. She stated that he applied a ""headlock and dragged me to the riverbank"" and then ""threw me down the hill"". The bouncers at the hotel intervened and called the police. The police let the appellant's boyfriend leave. They escorted her back into the hotel to her friends. 

10In her evidence before the sentencing judge the appellant stated that the police then took her to the house that she lived in with her boyfriend and his family in South Dubbo, but there was no-one home. The police returned her to the hotel. She stated that she and her friends later returned to the residence where she was living. She said that her boyfriend came home. He was banging on the door and was very angry. He eventually ran in ""trying to get to me"". He was restrained and left. She stated that her friend then came to console her. Around 4am she left in a car with one of her friends to purchase some cigarettes. 

11The sentencing judge did not recount all these facts, instead stating that, after her boyfriend had left the hotel where he had been violent towards her, the appellant ""went to the home of friends"". I understand this to be an attempt to summarise the effect of her evidence. 

12In any event, while in the car on the journey to purchase cigarettes the appellant observed her boyfriend's vehicle outside the victim's home. The victim was a former friend of the appellant. 

13The appellant went to the front door of the premises and opened the screen door. She pounded on a glass panel of the door. She broke one of the panels. The sentencing judge stated that he was satisfied that she did not ""originally intend to break"" the panel. She put her hand inside the door and opened it. As she did so she cut her hand. 

14The appellant walked inside the premises and came across the victim who was exiting her bathroom. About this time her boyfriend appeared from the victim's bedroom, wearing only his underpants. The sentencing judge found that what happened next was that ""[t]here was some brief conversation and the [appellant] punched the victim three or four times to the face"". I understand this to be a short form summary of what the appellant stated in her evidence before the sentencing judge, namely:

""I stood in the doorway then [the victim] walked out of her bedroom in undies and a singlet. I then - she was walking to me and I was walking to her and I was just, I was saying [to the victim] 'Can you please get him out so I can speak to him.' There were words, she was standing in my sort of - I was just wanting to get to [my boyfriend].

.... 

Q Where you able to get past [the victim]? 
A No I wasn't. 

Q Why weren't you able to get past [the victim]?
A She kept stepping in front of me. 

Q What happened then?
A I pushed her in the face to get her out of my road. I then stupidly punched her in the face three to four times."" 

15The appellant's boyfriend restrained her and took her to a car. She was driven away from the scene by her friend. The police and an ambulance attended. According to the sentencing judge the victim sustained ""bleeding, bruising and an injury to the left orbital floor"". She did not require surgery. The tip of her nose was broken. By the time the appellant was sentenced it had healed completely. A photograph of the victim showed significant bruising around her left eye. The sentencing judge noted that the victim was ""not hospitalised for any extensive period"".

16The police sought to speak to the appellant. She read from a prepared statement when she spoke to them. She admitted to breaking the glass panel on the door and punching the victim to the face. 

The applicant's subjective case 

17The applicant presented a strong subjective case. This was her first conviction. At the time of the offence she was 20 years of age. She was the youngest of three children. Her parents had separated when she was approximately four years old. At the time of sentencing she had moved from Dubbo to Sydney. She was living with her mother, and her mother's partner, a former Detective Chief Inspector in the police force. She was working full time as a barista.

18The appellant was educated to a year 11 standard. She had been in full time work since leaving school. After moving back to Sydney she commenced studying a community services course at TAFE two nights a week. She hoped to pursue a career in the community sector. 

19As I have stated, at the time of the offence she had been in a relationship with her boyfriend for approximately two years. The pre-sentence report described the relationship as ""tumultuous"". It had ceased by the time she was being sentenced. 

20Tendered at the sentencing hearing were character references from a medical specialist, the appellant's employer in Sydney, her mother's partner and a doctor in Orange. All the authors were fully aware of the circumstances surrounding the offence. They confirmed that they knew the appellant very well. They described her as calm and the offence as being completely out of character. 

21The pre-sentence report indicated that the appellant was unlikely to require or benefit from supervision because she was ""satisfactorily addressing"" the issues that had brought her before the Court through ""alcohol abstinence and participation in counselling"". It concluded: 

""[The appellant] presented as a driven young woman of quiet demeanour. It would appear that following the consumption of alcohol (to the point of intoxication) and the culmination of events that eventually led to her relationship breakdown with her partner at the time, she engaged in behaviours that were largely out of character. Overall she presented as aware of the impact of her actions and has sought intervention to address any outstanding emotional issues. She is further encouraged by having the support of her family and the continued prospect of ongoing stable employment.""

Sentencing judgment

22I have already summarised the facts surrounding the offence which are reflected in the primary findings of fact made by the sentencing judge. I note the following six additional matters concerning the sentencing judgment. 

23First, the sentencing judge noted that the appellant was entitled to the full 25% discount by reason of her entering a plea of guilty at the earliest occasion (see R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383).

24Second, his Honour found that the offence was aggravated by reason of the fact that it occurred in the victim's home (see s 21A(2)(eb) of the Sentencing Act). There is no challenge to that conclusion. 

25Third, the sentencing judge was satisfied that the appellant was remorseful for her actions. 

26Fourth, the sentencing judge accepted that there was ""very little likelihood of [the appellant] ever reoffending"". 

27Fifth, having regard to the references tendered on the appellant's behalf the sentencing judge accepted that the offence was ""very much out of character"". 

28Sixth, the sentencing judge accepted that the appellant's actions were not premeditated. 

29Despite these matters, the sentencing judge imposed a full time custodial sentence. The sentencing judge referred to s 5 of the Sentencing Act and stated that he was ""firmly of the opinion that no other sentence other than a sentence of custody is appropriate."" Next the sentencing judge determined the length of the sentence and considered that the ""appropriate starting point"" was twenty months, which was then reduced having regard to the appellant's plea of guilty. Finally the sentencing judge considered that, given the circumstances of the offender, the nature of the injuries suffered, and the need for general deterrence it was not appropriate to suspend the sentence. However, his Honour also considered that a finding of special circumstances was appropriate having regard to the fact that it was the appellant's first time in custody, and what the sentencing judge considered was the ""need for some type of supervision"". 

Grounds of appeal

30Ground one of the appellant's appeal contended that the sentencing judge erred in failing to have regard to what was said to be a mitigating factor, namely the domestic violence perpetrated upon the appellant on the evening of the offence by her then-boyfriend. This ground of appeal needs to be considered with ground two of the appeal which asserted that the sentencing judge had erred in concluding that the case warranted the significant application of considerations of general deterrence, because his Honour erred in his assessment of the facts. 

31I have already adverted to the findings of fact made by the sentencing judge which involved an acceptance of the appellant's evidence as to the circumstances which led to her assaulting the victim. The sentencing judge stated: 

""As will be obvious from my findings of fact I accept a good deal of what [the appellant] told me about the events that led her to be pounding on the victim's door in the early hours of the morning of 10 December 2011. I am prepared to accept that [her former boyfriend] was aggressive towards her, although I note that police did not take any action against him save for separating the two of them. I accept that [the appellant] when she says that she felt very upset and angry when she saw [her former boyfriend's] vehicle outside the victim's home. I also accept she initially wanted to confront [her former boyfriend] rather than the victim.""

32Despite these findings, when later considering the question of general deterrence the sentencing judge stated:

""I have no difficulty whatsoever accepting that there is that very significant issue of general deterrence. I have dealt with far too many matters in my time as a judicial officer both in this jurisdiction and another where people far too quickly resort to violence over some personal insult or slur."" 
(emphasis added)


33It was submitted this part of the sentencing judgment mischaracterised the circumstances of the offence. In particular, it was submitted that the reference to people being ""too [quick] to resort to"" violence over some ""personal insult or slur"" is an inaccurate description of what occurred. 

34I accept that submission. It was erroneous of his Honour to equate the circumstances of the offence committed by the appellant with some extreme response to a relatively minor personal insult or slur. The appellant was subjected to violence at the hands of her boyfriend and then confronted by his infidelity with her former friend. These circumstances represented a far more emotionally challenging situation than the sentencing judge was prepared to accept. Once it is accepted that this was an incident completely out of character then it follows that the characterisation of it as a ""quick resort to violence"" over a personal insult was wrong. 

35The balance of the submissions on this ground on behalf of the appellant referred to the event as having occurred in the context of a ""history of emotional and physical abuse"" of the appellant at the hands of her ex-boyfriend. The findings of the sentencing judge do not support such a characterisation of the history of the relationship and the evidence given by the appellant did not seek to place it in that context. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that grounds one and two are made out. 

36Ground three of the appeal asserts that his Honour erred in determining where, in the objective scale of criminality, this offence lay by reference to ""'routine' matters that [came] before [the] Court"". This ground refers to the following passage in the sentencing judgment:

""I am of the opinion in all of the circumstances that this matter is in the range of being slightly below the halfway mark on the scale of seriousness of matters of this sort that routinely come before the criminal courts.""

37It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that this approach was erroneous in that what is ""routine"" is said not to provide any relevant bench mark as to the appropriate penalty. This was said to be particularly so in a case such as this where the circumstances were ""quite unusual"" in that the appellant was 20 years old, had no criminal history, no tendency towards violence, and was said to be motivated, or at least affected, by having been physically abused by her partner. 

38Prior to the High Court's decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, it was customary when imposing sentences for offences carrying a standard non-parole period to make some assessment as to where the particular offence stood in comparison with ""the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" as referred to in s 54A(2) of the Sentencing Act. Following the decision in Muldrock it is unclear whether such a classification is required, permitted, or prohibited (see R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [19] per Basten JA). 

39The offence committed by the appellant does not carry a standard non-parole period. In such cases an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence is appropriate. In R v Sivell [2009] NSWCCA 286 at [32] Fullerton J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J agreed) stated:

""....it is sufficient for a sentencing judge to make an assessment of objective criminality by reference to the maximum penalty, and to those other features of the particular offending that bear upon the gravity of the offence having regard to the circumstances of its commission, on a broad gradient of seriousness."" 

40Further, McClellan CJ at CL added (at [5]):

""Where a standard non parole period is not provided for an offence, the objective seriousness of the offence does not, of itself, direct attention to any particular type of punishment or term of imprisonment which must both be determined after all of the relevant matters, both objective and subjective, which inform the seriousness of the offence have been considered."" 

41In this case his Honour's reference to ""matters of this sort that routinely come before the criminal courts"" suggests that the mischaracterisation of the circumstances upheld by grounds one and two affected this assessment. It is unlikely that his Honour had so many cases that were truly similar to the circumstances of this offence that they had become ""routine"". Instead it is more likely that the reference to the circumstances of the offence as ""routine"" is attributable to his Honour's misdescription of the offence as a quick resort to violence ""over some personal insult or slur"". The true circumstances of this offence could not be characterised as ""slightly below the halfway mark on the scale of objective seriousness"". I would uphold ground three of the appeal. 

42Ground four of the appeal argues that the sentence was manifestly excessive. I have already upheld the grounds of appeal which take issue with his Honour's characterisation of the objective seriousness of the offence. In my view, it was not open to his Honour to characterise this offence as anything other than involving a low level of criminality for the types of offences contemplated by s 112(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. Insofar as the appellant had broken and entered into the victim's premises it was an act which was neither premeditated nor motivated by opportunism, personal gain, or violent intent. Instead, it was the outcome of an out of character emotional response to having been mistreated by her ex-boyfriend earlier in the evening, coupled with learning that his vehicle was outside the victim's home at 4.30am in the morning. The circumstances in which she came to assault the victim similarly involved an emotional response to a distressing experience. In stating that, it is clear that the victim did not provoke the appellant and is in no way to be taken as having contributed to the attack upon her. The circumstance of being assaulted in her own home would have been upsetting and clearly caused her significant pain and distress. 

43The combination of the circumstances of the offence, the findings of remorse and that the appellant's conduct was out of character, coupled with the finding that there was very little likelihood that she would ever reoffend, meant that in this case it was not open to his Honour to be ""satisfied"" that ""having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than prison [was] appropriate"" (s 5(1) of the Sentencing Act). 

44This is an unusual outcome in that offences involving a violation of a person's home and the infliction of violence almost invariably attract a custodial sentence. Nevertheless the command in s 5(1) of the Sentencing Act is an extremely important protection designed to ensure that persons such as the appellant, ie young adults of good character, are not incarcerated with all the adverse consequences that can flow to them, their families and the wider community unless the objective circumstances of the offence truly require it. It follows that I would also uphold ground four of the appeal.

Resentencing

45The consequence of finding error on the part of the sentencing judge was that the Court was required to undertake a resentencing of the appellant. To that end, evidence was read on the appeal from the appellant as to her circumstances since the time she was sentenced, along with an affidavit from her mother and her mother's partner. 

46The appellant stated that after her release on bail she returned to her work as a barista. She later obtained casual work at a retail store and has since been offered a permanent casual position. Since her release on bail her alcohol consumption has been minimal and she has been receiving counselling. She stated that the result of being incarcerated was that she was unable to complete her TAFE course. She has discovered that, even if she were to resume it, it would be extremely difficult for her to find work in the community sector by reason of her criminal conviction. In the immediate future she plans to enrol in a beauty course at TAFE. The appellant stated that she found her time in gaol ""very difficult and overwhelming"" and that she felt ""traumatised"". 

47The appellant's mother described visiting her daughter in gaol on weekends. Her daughter has been living with her in Darlinghurst since her release on bail. She states that her daughter's behaviour since her release has been exemplary. She notes that her daughter only rarely consumes alcohol and rarely socialises. She is concerned that her daughter seems depressed and listless and has difficulties sleeping most nights. The appellant's mother's evidence is supported by an affidavit from her partner. 

48This affidavit material serves to reinforce that which was apparent at the time of sentencing would be likely to occur if she were incarcerated. For the purpose of the re-sentencing exercise it reveals that the appellant has already suffered significant punishment and that she has been of good behaviour since being released on bail. 

49I was of the view, that if the sentencing exercise had been undertaken afresh as from 30 May 2012, the appropriate penalty would be to direct the appellant to enter a bond to be of good behaviour of 12 months, pursuant to s 9(1) of the Sentencing Act. However, given the period of time the appellant spent in custody and the fact that she has been of good behaviour from the time of her release on bail to the hearing of the appeal, I joined in the orders providing that the period of the bond be six months from 7 February 2013.

2761083,Police v Pines [2013] NSWLC 3,"Judgment

Introduction and history of the proceedings
1This matter came before me on 31 January 2013 when the solicitor for the accused made application that I mark the papers ""no jurisdiction"". As I understand the submission that was advanced to me it was based upon s 33(2) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (MHFP Act). The accused sought to put detailed submissions before me, and the delay in the delivery of this decision is partly a result in the delay in the receipt of those submissions.

2In order to consider the submission made on behalf of the accused it is necessary to outline the history of the proceedings in so far as the court record is concerned. I do not have available to me the transcript of any aspect of the proceedings.

3The evidence tendered to me and the notations on the court file indicate the following. Police allege that on 22 October 2011 the accused committed some 10 offences. They are: malicious damage (3 counts), Assault police officer in execution of duty occasioning actual bodily harm (1 count), behave in an offensive manner in a public place (1 count), Use offensive language in a public place (1 count), Assault police officer in the execution of duty (3 counts), Resist or hinder police in execution of duty (1 count).

4It appears from the material before me that the police who arrested the accused on 22 October 2011 took the accused to the Prince of Wales Hospital under s 22 of the Mental Health Act 2007. The court attendance notices that were issued in relation to the alleged offences were returnable on 23 November 2011 at Central. 

5The papers indicate that the accused appeared on 23 November 2011 from custody. The file indicates that on that day a letter was presented to the Court dated 23 November 2011 under the hand of Dr Laurie Power, a Senior Consultant Psychiatrist at the Prince of Wales Hospital. The letter contains the following:
""Mr Pine is a young man who has Bipolar Affective Disorder with manic lapses. He was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital on the 6th September 2011 with a manic episode. Prior to his admission I understand he committed a serious crime for which he is charged. I believe that at the time of his crime he was mentally ill. He has improved greatly during his admission and is fit for discharge soon. On discharge the plan is to see him on a regular basis, initially once to twice a week, with regular acute care team follow up and a possible case manager and community treatment order......I would recommend to the court that he be returned to the Prince of Wales Hospital, so that he can continue his treatment.""

6It appears given the date mentioned in the letter, that the ""serious crime"" referred to was not one of the alleged offences that were before the Court on 23 November 2011.

7The Court papers for 23 November 2011 contain the following handwritten note: ""Sect 33 taken by police officer and detained in mental facility for treatment."" This is an apparent reference to s 33 of the MHFP Act. On the file is a copy of the order made under s 33(1)(a) of the MHFP Act signed by the Registrar. The terms of the order are as follows: ""The defendant is to be taken by police, or a prescribed person as ordered by the Court and detained in the mental health facility for assessment in accordance with the Mental Health Act 2007."" Both the order and the court papers indicated that the proceedings were adjourned to 13 December 2011.

8The discharge summary from the hospital is before me and it records the fact that the accused was discharged from the Prince of Wales Hospital on 25 November 2011. It noted that he had a court date on 13 December 2011 and that the accused had been advised to seek legal advice.

9The court papers indicate that on 13 December 2011 when the proceedings were mentioned at Central, the accused did not appear. He was legally represented, the papers noted that he had been, ""discharged from (indecipherable)"" on 25 November 2011. The papers indicated that the accused had his bail continued and the matter was adjourned to 17 January 2012 for plea or mention. There was a direction for the Registrar to notify the accused to attend or a warrant for his arrest would issue.

10The court papers indicate that on 17 January 2012 the proceedings were mentioned at Central. There was no appearance of the accused and the legal representative sought, and was granted, leave to withdraw. The papers were marked ""warrants to issue"" although it does not appear that there was any action taken under s 196 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

11On 22 October 2012 the accused appeared at Waverley Court having been arrested under the warrant that had been issued at Central on 17 January 2012. Bail was refused, pleas of not guilty were entered, and the matter was listed for reply to the brief on 28 November 2012. It appears that later that day bail was in fact granted to the accused.

12The proceedings were next before the Court on 28 November 2012. I am unable to determine precisely what happened on that occasion apart from the fact that bail was varied and the proceedings were adjourned to 18 December 2012.

13On 18 December 2012 the accused appeared on bail, his pleas of not guilty were maintained and the proceedings were adjourned to 8 January 2013. 

14On 8 January 2013 the proceedings were adjourned to the Downing Centre to fix a date for hearing, as the estimate of the hearing date was more than a day.

15On 10 January 2013 the proceedings were adjourned to 17 January 2013 with the papers noting ""Q of jurisdiction as s.33(1)(a) order made 6 months (indecipherable)"".

16On 17 January 2013 the proceedings were adjourned to 31 January 2013 for hearing with the notation ""on Q of jurisdiction s.32"". 

17As I indicated at the outset, the proceedings were argued before me on 31 January.

18The material before me is silent as to what the hospital did once it determined the accused was no longer to be detained as a mentally ill person, apart from discharging him on 25 November 2011 and advising him of his court date and to seek legal advice. All I know is the accused was discharged from the hospital and did not appear in court on the adjourned date. He was discharged from the mental health facility only two days after the making of the order. A warrant was issued for his arrest on 17 January 2012 but he was not brought before the court upon execution of that warrant until 22 October 2012. That was more than 6 months after the making of the order. The question arises as to whether in those circumstances the charges were dismissed by operation of the statute.

The statutory provisions
19The starting point is section 33 of the MHFP Act. It is contained in Part 3 of that legislation and applies to summary offences and indictable offences triable summarily before a magistrate.

20That section relevantly provides as follows:

Mentally ill persons 
(1)     If, at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a Magistrate, it appears to the Magistrate that the defendant is a mentally ill person, the Magistrate (without derogating from any other order the Magistrate may make in relation to the defendant, whether by way of adjournment, the granting of bail in accordance with the Bail Act 1978 or otherwise): 
(a)   may order that the defendant be taken to, and detained in, a mental health facility for assessment, or 
(b)   may order that the defendant be taken to, and detained in, a mental health facility for assessment and that, if the defendant is found on assessment at the mental health facility not to be a mentally ill person or mentally disordered person, the person be brought back before a Magistrate or an authorised officer, or
(c)   may discharge the defendant, unconditionally or subject to conditions, into the care of a responsible person.
…
(2)     If a defendant is dealt with at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a Magistrate or authorised officer in accordance with this section, the charge which gave rise to the proceedings, on the expiration of the period of 6 months after the date on which the defendant is so dealt with, is to be taken to have been dismissed unless, within that period, the defendant is brought before a Magistrate to be further dealt with in relation to the charge.
(3)     If a defendant is brought before a Magistrate to be further dealt with in relation to a charge as referred to in subsection (2), the Magistrate must, in dealing with the charge, take account of any period during which the defendant was in a mental health facility as a consequence of an order made under this section.
(4)     The fact that charges are to be taken to have been dismissed under subsection (2) does not constitute a finding that the charges against the defendant are proven or otherwise.
…
(6)     In this section, a reference to an “authorised officer” is a reference to an authorised officer within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
21The argument advanced on behalf of the accused is that an order was made under s 33(1)(a) of the MHFP Act on 23 November 2011, and he was not brought before a magistrate within the 6 month period referred to in s 33(2) of the MHFP Act. The submission on behalf of the accused is that it is immaterial that the proceedings involving the accused were listed before a magistrate in the 6 month period, if the accused is not physically brought before a magistrate in that period, the charge or charges to which the order related are taken to have been dismissed.

22In my opinion it is appropriate in considering the submission made on behalf of the accused, to have regard to s 32 of the Mental Health Act 2007 as it interacts with s 33 of the MH FP Act. 

23Section 32 of the Mental Health Act provides a mechanism whereby if an order is made under s 33(1)(a) of the MHFP Act, and an accused is assessed as not being mentally ill, the accused may be brought back before the Court. Section 32 of the Mental Health Act provides as follows:

Detention on order of Magistrate or bail officer
(1) This section applies to a person detained in a mental health facility under this Part who is required not to be detained or further detained in the facility and who was taken to the facility:

(a) by a police officer under this Division after being apprehended by a police officer because the officer believed the person to be committing or to have recently committed an offence, or 
(b) on the order of a Magistrate or an authorised officer under section 33 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. 
(2) An authorised medical officer must release the person into the custody of any relevant person who is present at the mental health facility to ascertain the results of any examination or examinations of the person.
(3) If a relevant person is not so present when the authorised medical officer becomes aware that the person must not be detained or further detained, the authorised medical officer must, as soon as practicable, notify a police officer at the appropriate police station that the person will not be further detained.
(4) The authorised medical officer may take any of the following actions in relation to a person (other than a person referred to in subsection (5)), after considering any matter communicated by a police officer as to the intended apprehension of the person by a police officer:

(a) detain the person for a period not exceeding one hour pending the person's apprehension by a police officer,
(b) admit the person in accordance with this Act as a voluntary patient,
(c) discharge the person, in so far as it may be possible to do so, into the care of the person's primary carer, 
(d) discharge the person. 
(5) If the person is a person ordered to be brought back before a court under section 33 (1) (b) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990: (a) it is the duty of the police officer notified by the authorised medical officer to ensure that a police officer attends the mental health facility and apprehends the person as soon as practicable after notification, and (b) the authorised medical officer must detain the person pending the person's apprehension by a police officer. 
(6) A police officer may apprehend a person under this section without a warrant.
(7) In subsections (2) and (3): ""relevant person"" means: (a) if the detained person was taken to the mental health facility on an order under section 33 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, any person (including a police officer) charged by the order with taking the person from the facility, or (b) in any other case, a police officer. 

24Section 32 of the Mental Health Act draws a distinction between persons in relation to whom an order is made under s 33(1)(b) of the MHFP Act and persons to whom an order under another subsection is made. Where an order, as here, is made under s 33(1)(a) of the MHFP Act, the authorised medical officer upon determining the person may no longer be detained as a mentally ill person, is to release the person into the custody of what the section refers to as a ""relevant person"" if that person is at the mental health facility. Where an order is made under s 33(1)(a) of the MHFP Act, such a person is any person including a police officer charged by the order with taking the person from the facility, or a police officer. There is some ambiguity in the provision because where an order is made under s 33(1)(a) there is no person named in the order, ""charged with taking the person from the facility"". 

25If a ""relevant person"" is not present at the mental health facility when the authorised medical officer becomes aware that the person must not be further detained, the authorised medical officer must as soon as practicable, notify a police officer at the appropriate police station that the person will not be further detained (see s 32(3)).

26Where a person is the subject of an order under section 33 of the MHFP Act, other than an order under s 33(1)(b) of the Act, the authorised medical officer may detain a person for up to an hour pending the person's apprehension by a police officer. That power exists no doubt to ensure that an accused person can be brought before a magistrate where an order under s 33(1)(a) MHFP has been made. However, where the order is not made under s 33(1)(b) of the MHFP Act, there is no duty under the Act on a police officer who has been contacted by the authorised medical officer to attend and apprehend the person. Contrast this with the situation under s 32(5) of the Mental Health Act. Where the order is made under s 33(1)(a) of the MHFP Act there are other options available to the authorised medical officer (see s 32(4)).

27Section 32 of the Mental Health Act provides a mechanism whereby a person dealt with under s 33(1)(a) or (b) of the MHFP Act may physically be taken back before a magistrate. That provision is clearly concerned with the physical return of the person so that the person is before a magistrate.

28Section 33(2) of the MHFP Act provides that the charges are taken to be dismissed unless the defendant is brought before a magistrate in the 6 month period.

Academic Consideration of s 33 of the MHFP Act
29I am not aware of any higher court consideration of the s 33(2) of the MHFP Act. I have considered the second reading speech and the explanatory notes in relation to the legislation none of which shed any light on the issue. (I note in passing the legislation was at the time it was initially passed called the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990).

30There has been some discussion in academic writing on s 33 of the MHFP Act which suggests that an order under s 33(1)(a) is a final order in relation to a charge as the order itself does not provide for the accused to return to a magistrate if found not to be mentally ill.

31Section 33 of the MHFP Act has been considered in Crime and Mental Health Law in New South Wales by Dan Howard and Dr Bruce Westmore (2nd edition) published by Lexis Nexis Butterworths. In that publication the learned authors quote from New South Wales Law Reform Commission Consultation Paper 7, which was published in 2010. That discussion paper describes s 33 of the MHFP Act as allowing the involuntary admission of an offender diverted from criminal proceedings. The learned authors point out that the following comment appears in the discussion paper;

""the power [under section 33 (1) (a)] to refer the defendant for assessment without requiring that he or she be returned to court is generally used for low-level offending where the magistrate would, in the event that the charges were proven, probably discharge the defendant without conviction.""

32The discussion contained in Crime and Mental Health Law in New South Wales, supports the view that an order under s 33(1)(a) of the MHFP Act is a final order disposing to finality of a charge as it does not of itself provide for the return of an accused to Court if found not to be mentally ill.

33The NSW Law Reform Commission also discussed s 33 of the MHFP Act and its interaction with the Mental Health Act in greater detail in its report no. 135 titled ""People with Cognitive and Mental Health in the Criminal Justice System: Diversion"". The Commission discussed the uncertainty surrounding orders made under the section, in particular in relation to orders under s 33(1)(a), and whether or not an order made under that section is a ""final order"" in terms of the charge brought against an accused. The Report notes that an order under s 33(1)(a) of the MHFP Act is viewed by some judicial officers as a final order in relation to the charge brought against an accused. This is in keeping with the comment from the Commission's discussion paper, which I have set out above.

Conclusion
34In my opinion an order made under s.33(1)(a) is not a final order in relation to a charge brought against an accused. The analysis I set out earlier of s 32 of the Mental Health Act demonstrates that the section does provide a mechanism for the return to Court of a person who is subject to such an order but is not found to be mentally ill. The mechanism is such that it may be that such a person is not returned to a magistrate, but a mechanism is provided. This is particularly so because where the order is under s 33(1)(a) the medical officer can only detain the person for an hour and there is no duty on a police officer who may be contacted to attend the hospital.

35In my opinion the fact that when a magistrate decides to send a person for assessment under s 33 of the MHFP Act, a person need only appear to be mentally ill, is another reason suggesting that an order under s 33(1)(a) is not a final order. At the time the order is made a magistrate is unlikely to have available a medical diagnosis of the accused, and the provision is engaged if it simply appears to a magistrate that an accused is mentally ill. It would be surprising if a final order could be made on the basis of simply how an accused appeared.

36I turn to consider the ordinary meaning of the words used in s 33(2) of the MHFP Act. In my opinion there can be no doubt that the phrase ""If a defendant is dealt with at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a Magistrate in accordance with this section"", is simply a reference to the taking of the accused to a mental health facility in accordance with an order made under s 33(1)(a) (or (b)). There is simply no other action needed for the accused to be dealt with under the section. Where the order is made under s 33(1)(a) the manner in which an accused is then to be dealt with, once taken to the mental health facility, is not governed by the terms of the order or the MHFP Act, but in accordance with the provisions of the Mental Health Act. See my earlier analysis.

37Here the evidence is that the accused was taken to and detained in a mental health facility for assessment in accordance with the order made. In my opinion the accused was dealt with in accordance with the section.

38The phrase ""brought before a magistrate"" contained in s 33(2) contains ordinary common English words. The word ""brought"" is the past participle of the word ""bring"". The Concise Oxford Dictionary relevantly defines ""bring"" to mean ""carry or accompany to a place"". The word ""bring"" involves the physical movement of something. Relevantly the word ""before"" is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary to mean, ""in front of"". When regard is had to the definitions of those words, the ordinary English meaning of the phrase ""brought before a magistrate"", in my opinion, is that the person concerned is to be physically brought in front of a magistrate. The mere listing of proceedings before a magistrate does not equate, in my opinion, with bringing a person before a magistrate. 

39I am conscious that the object of s 33 of the MHFP is to provide for diversion of persons from the criminal justice system, in relation to summary offences or indictable offences triable summarily, who at the time they are before the Court, appear to be mentally ill. The deemed dismissal of the charges under s 33(2), if such a person has not been brought before the Court within 6 months of an order being made under s 33, may well have been intended by the legislature only to apply where a person remained in a mental health facility for 6 months or more. While that may well have been the legislative intention, the words used in the section do not reflect that intention, and I can see no other provisions in the statute that restrict the ordinary English meaning of the phrase. It would have been very easy for the legislature to qualify the provisions in s 33(2), by requiring some inquiry as to the reason why the person had not been brought before the Court, yet there is no such qualification. 

40In arriving at this conclusion I have had regard to s 33 of the Interpretation Act 1987, which requires that ""a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule... shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote the purpose or object."" To insert in s 33(2) of the MHFP Act a requirement that the charges are only to be taken to be dismissed if the accused was detained for the 6 month period in a mental health facility, involves a fundamental amendment to the terms of the provision and that requirement does not arise by implication.

41Section 33(2) of the MHFP Act, in my opinion, operates to deem dismissed the charges if an accused, in relation to whom an order was made under s 33(1)(a) of the MHFP Act, is not physically brought before a magistrate within the 6 month period specified in the section. The section does not invite any inquiry as to why the person was not brought before a magistrate. If the person is not so brought, the charges are taken to be dismissed by operation of the statutory provision.

42In my opinion, it follows that there are no charges before the court as they are taken to be dismissed by operation of the statutory provision, as the accused was not brought before a magistrate within 6 months of the making of the order. It matters not that he was not detained in a mental health facility for that period, or that it appears on the evidence before me, that having been discharged from that facility, he failed to appear at court. It follows, in my opinion, that the Court has no jurisdiction as the charges are deemed to have been dismissed by operation of the statute. Whether further charges may still be brought against the accused is a matter which I do not need to consider.

43This analysis of s 33 of the MHFP Act means that police and prosecuting authorities, in relation to accused persons charged with summary offences or indictable offences to be tried summarily, and in relation to whom an order is made under s 33, in particular s 33 (1)(a), will need to monitor the assessment and treatment of such a person. They will need to liaise closely with the mental health facility to which the person has been taken for assessment to ensure that if the person is no longer to be detained by that facility, they are brought before a magistrate in the 6 month period.

2761084,Boyd v R [2013] NSWCCA 52,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Button J.

2BELLEW J: I agree with Button J.

3BUTTON J: On 1 June 2011, the applicant was arraigned in the District Court of New South Wales at Parramatta before her Honour Judge Ashford and a jury panel. The indictment contained a single count averring that on 29 January 2009 the applicant supplied a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug; namely, 893 grams of methylamphetamine. The applicant pleaded not guilty, the jury was empanelled, and the trial commenced.

4On 8 June 2011, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Subsequently, her Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment with a head sentence of 7 years 6 months and a non-parole period of 4 years to date from 29 May 2011.

5The applicant seeks leave to appeal against conviction and has notified a single ground with regard to a question of fact: that the verdict of the jury is unreasonable or unable to be supported. That ground is resisted by the Crown.

6There is also a single ground seeking leave to appeal against sentence, founded only on an asserted inadequacy in the backdate granted by her Honour. The Crown does not resist that adjustment. Accordingly, if the ground of appeal against conviction is not upheld, the application for leave to appeal against sentence can be dealt with briefly at the end of this judgment.

Appeal against conviction

7The ground of appeal against conviction calls for a consideration of the evidence as a whole. It is convenient to analyse the Crown case by first identifying matters that were and were not in dispute at the trial. The evidence will be analysed generally in chronological order.

Crown case - undisputed facts

8On 27 January 2009 at 6:52pm, the applicant engaged in an intercepted telephone conversation with a Mr Farrar. It was obvious from the terms of the conversation that they were friends. Mr Farrar informed the applicant that ""me mate from Mussie"" was intending to come over the following day. It was agreed between Mr Farrar and the applicant that that person should attend ""tomorrow night"". The applicant said ""Yeah I should have it all serviced for him"". Mr Farrar referred to another person attending as well. Towards the end of the conversation, Mr Farrar referred to ""what we talked about you, you know eh?"", and the applicant replied ""yeah"".

9On 27 January 2009 at 10:40pm, an SMS message was sent from the mobile phone of the applicant to the mobile phone of Mr Farrar. The message was ""Bro see you on weekend 100%"".

10On 28 January 2009 at 7:21am, a further telephone conversation took place between Mr Farrar and the applicant. The applicant asked ""Can they come?"", and a little later Mr Farrar replied ""Yeah, yeah. Yep."" The applicant requested that the visitor under discussion attend at 3pm. The applicant said ""And um what, what ya said last time he's gonna do, eh?"", and Mr Farrar replied ""yeah, yeah, yep."" Mr Farrar said ""There's that and I'll just when, when I come down, when Azza comes down um what's there like fifteen I think"". And the applicant replied ""Alright"". Mr Farrar said ""And then, and then when I go on holidays it should be the rest when I get back"", and the applicant indicated his assent.

11On 28 January 2009 at 11:36am, a further telephone conversation took place between Mr Farrar and the applicant. Amongst other things, Mr Farrar said ""Oi three tomorrow he said. Is that all right?"", and the applicant replied ""Yeah"".

12On 29 January 2009 at 10:10am, an SMS was sent from the mobile telephone of Mr Farrar to the mobile telephone of the applicant. The message consisted only of the mobile telephone number of a Mr Hobbs. Mr Hobbs lived in Aberdeen, a township near Muswellbrook.

13On 29 January 2009 at 10:12am, a telephone conversation took place between Mr Farrar and the applicant. Mr Farrar said ""That's Old Mate's number."" As to the question as to whether the person under the discussion would ""be there"", Mr Farrar said ""He will but - it'll be good"", and the applicant replied ""Alright mate"".

14On 29 January 2009 between 10:25am and 2:56pm, a number of curt SMS messages passed between the mobile telephones of the applicant and Mr Hobbs. An arrangement was made to meet at the Hungry Jack's restaurant at Wentworthville. The last message was sent from the mobile telephone of Mr Hobbs to that of the applicant, and was ""Yeh im here"".

15On 29 January 2009 at 12.49pm, the vehicle of Mr Hobbs entered the carpark of Westfield Parramatta.

16On 29 January 2009 at 1:21pm, a receipt was generated at the Pulse Pharmacy at Westfield Parramatta. It referred to a number of items, including two amounts of Glucodin.

17On 29 January 2009 at 1:22pm, two CCTV photographs from Westfield Parramatta show images of Mr Hobbs strolling through that shopping centre, apparently with a female companion. In his right hand he is holding something that appears to be white and perhaps green, and is very generally consistent with the appearance of a shopping bag.

18On 29 January 2009 at 3pm, the police conducted surveillance of the Hungry Jack's restaurant at Wentworthville. Detective Mackay was the operator of a video camera that was trained on the scene. During the video recording of events, Detective Mackay also provided a contemporaneous oral commentary about what he was seeing.

19Detective Kiem was also one of the police undertaking surveillance at that location.

20Mr Hobbs arrived at the restaurant in a red Nissan. The applicant arrived in a black BMW. Mr Hobbs alighted from his vehicle with something in his hand. He approached a vehicle that was, in fact, an unmarked police car. He sought to open one of its doors, but then returned to the Nissan.

21The applicant and his female companion alighted and entered the restaurant. The Nissan was driven to a spot adjacent to the BMW. Mr Hobbs and a female companion then alighted from the Nissan and entered the restaurant. Shortly after, the applicant and Mr Hobbs met at the front of the restaurant. The two men shook hands. 

22The applicant returned to his BMW. Mr Hobbs returned to the Nissan. He then walked the short distance to the vehicle of the applicant and was carrying something in his right hand. Mr Hobbs entered the motor vehicle of the applicant. The applicant then drove the vehicle to a position some distance from where he had originally parked, but still within the car park of the restaurant. Mr Hobbs then alighted from the BMW and walked back to the Nissan. He then drove the Nissan and parked it so that it was adjacent to the BMW in its new position. 

23Mr Hobbs then alighted from the Nissan again. He entered the vehicle of the applicant a second time. After a short time, he left the BMW a second time and returned to the Nissan. The details of the latter movement were hotly disputed at the trial and are discussed in more depth later in my judgment. 

24Mr Hobbs then drove out of the car park, and police followed him. His motor vehicle was under continuous surveillance. He was observed to stop at a service station and purchase some ice (and to be perfectly clear, I refer to frozen water, not crystal methylamphetamine). He placed the ice in an esky in the boot of his motor vehicle.

25The surveillance of Mr Hobbs continued until he was arrested at 3.45pm at Hornsby. His motor vehicle was searched and $10,000 in cash was located in the glove box. Located in the boot of the motor vehicle was an esky. Inside the esky was a green, blue and white shopping bag with the markings of Pulse Pharmacy. Located in the plastic bag was the receipt generated at 1.21pm. Also contained in the shopping bag were two plastic containers. They contained methylamphetamine in the quantity to which the count in the indictment referred.

26No fingerprints or DNA evidence that could be linked to the applicant were located on any item found in the motor vehicle of Mr Hobbs. 

27The applicant was not followed by police on that day. Indeed, he was not arrested until months later. There was no evidence of anything found in his vehicle, or anywhere else, that could support the Crown contention.

28On 29 January 2009 at 4:20pm, an SMS was sent from the mobile telephone of Mr Farrar to that of the applicant. It was ""Did he come?"". Two minutes later, ""Yeah bra can u come tomorrow"" was sent in reply.

29On 30 January 2009 at 11:52am, Mr Farrar and the applicant had another telephone conversation. During the course of it, Mr Farrar asked ""Did he just give you five 0 yesterday?"", and the applicant replied in the affirmative. Thereafter Mr Farrar said ""Oh fuckin' I can't get hold of him"", And a little later ""Nah. Yeah I'm just ah, I'm just wonderin' whether he got home or not."" To that, the applicant replied ""Oh yeah. Fuck"", Mr Farrar said ""Cock sucker. Fuck!"", and the applicant said ""Shit eh.""

30A police officer with expertise with regard to the trade in illicit drugs gave evidence that it is commonly believed in the drug milieu that cooling methylamphetamine by way of ice preserves it. He also gave evidence that the amount of drug seized from the boot of the motor vehicle of Mr Hobbs would be worth somewhere between $70,000 and $80,000.

Crown case - matters in dispute

31Detective Mackay gave evidence that, whilst observing the events at the restaurant, he saw Mr Hobbs alight from the BMW the second time with a plastic bag in his hand. The submission of the Crown about that evidence was that the applicant had supplied the drugs to Mr Hobbs in the BMW, and that Mr Hobbs was taking them back to his vehicle.

32That evidence was the subject of attack in cross-examination by senior counsel for the applicant. He made the following points. First, whilst providing the audio commentary, Detective Mackay made no mention of seeing anything in the hand of Mr Hobbs when he left the motor vehicle of the applicant after it had been moved. Secondly, Detective Mackay made no contemporaneous note or any other record of what he claimed in evidence to have seen, despite the ready availability of his diary, in which he had recorded other observations that day. Thirdly, to the contrary, Detective Mackay said to his colleagues in the surveillance commentary that, although he had seen Mr Hobbs take something to the motor vehicle of the applicant on the first occasion, he ""did not see him take a package"" from that motor vehicle on the second occasion. 

33One of the explanations given by the detective for those seeming lapses was ""I had a lot of things going on in my mind"".

34To be clear, neither the Crown at trial nor in this Court denied that each of those three matters were aspects of the behaviour of Detective Mackay on the day.

35Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that, even looking at the surveillance video very carefully, one could not see Mr Hobbs leaving the vehicle of the applicant the second time with anything in his hand, contrary to the evidence of Detective Mackay.

36In short, senior counsel for the applicant bluntly put to Detective Mackay in cross-examination that his evidence was a fabrication, and made the same submission to the jury in his final address. That proposition was in turn disputed by the Crown at trial.

37Detective Kiem gave evidence that, whilst undertaking surveillance duties at Hungry Jack's, she observed Mr Hobbs standing at the boot of his motor vehicle. That was after he had left the vehicle of the applicant for a second time. She said that the boot was up and she saw Mr Hobbs ""moving or positioning an Esky in the back of the boot"". Again, that evidence was the subject of attack.

38In cross-examination, senior counsel for the applicant made two points. The first was that the video camera being used by Detective Mackay showed nothing of Mr Hobbs standing at the rear of his motor vehicle with the boot open. That was because the video camera panned across the scene and followed the motor vehicle of the applicant as it left the car park. When the video camera left the view of the Nissan, Mr Hobbs could not be seen at its rear. When the camera returned to his vehicle, again he could not be seen there.

39Secondly, Detective Kiem agreed that the video, when played in Court, showed that ""as you're passing to the rear of that red Nissan the man Hobbs is unsighted?"" and ""probably more importantly, the boot lid is closed is it not?"" In short, the witness agreed that the video showed that as she walked past the vehicle the boot lid remained closed. And yet, when being cross-examined some months before, and at a time when the witness had not had the opportunity to see the video, she had given evidence on oath that the boot lid was ""Still open as I walked past.""

40Again, senior counsel for the applicant did not put to the witness that she was mistaken or confused. He bluntly submitted that the evidence was fabricated, and nothing more than an inculpatory reconstruction of what was subsequently found by police to be in the boot of the vehicle of Mr Hobbs. The same submission was made to the jury.

41The Crown disputed the proposition that the evidence of the witness had been fabricated.

42Again, there was no dispute by the Crown at trial about the fact that the video did not show Mr Hobbs at the boot of his motor vehicle and thereby corroborate the evidence of Detective Kiem. The point was simply made that a video camera can only focus on one thing at a time, and it happened not to be focused there at the relevant time. Nor was there dispute about the transcript of what Detective Kiem had said on a previous occasion. As for the discrepancy about whether the boot lid was open or closed at the relevant time, the Crown Prosecutor sought to explain it in his final address by way of a detailed analysis of the video. Due to the fact that the segments of the video under discussion were not recorded with precision, it is not possible to reconstruct that analysis.

43As noted above, the applicant was not arrested until months later. Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that that was because, the police in truth not having seen anything that could amount to evidence of supply by the applicant, they were in no position to do so. He submitted that the evidence of police that the delay was ""due to an ongoing investigation"" was another fabrication.

44Finally, with regard to disputed matters, the video was played in this Court more than once. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that, looking at it carefully and in slow motion, one can indeed see something in the hand of Mr Hobbs when he leaves the vehicle of the applicant the second time. Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that one can see no such thing.

Aspects of trial

45Mr Farrar and Mr Hobbs gave evidence for neither party. The applicant did not give evidence, called no witnesses, and did not raise character.

46Although the focus of the single ground is very much on the evidence before the jury, it is necessary to detail one direction that her Honour gave the jury, in order to understand the submissions of senior counsel for the applicant in support of the ground. At the end of the summing-up, and contrary to the repeated submissions of the Crown at trial, her Honour said:

""Well I think as has fairly been put by defence counsel those links in the chain are essential in proving the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt. That is, acceptance of Mackay and acceptance of Kiem; the first one being of Mackay in relation to the supply matter and the second one of Kiem being in relation to the evidence of the plastic bag in the boot and the open boot and esky. So those two links again are essential matters upon which you must consider."" 

47In his final address to the jury, senior counsel for the applicant made a forthright attack upon the Crown case as described above. However, he did not provide for the consideration of the jury a rational alternative hypothesis consistent with innocence and with the undisputed facts. For example, he did not submit that perhaps it was Mr Hobbs who had supplied the applicant with something illicit in return for the cash in the glove box, and therefore the whole Crown case was misconceived.

Submissions in this Court

48Senior counsel for the applicant conceded that an analysis of all the evidence, including but not limited to the behaviour of the applicant at the scene, could lead to a conclusion that the state of affairs was ""certainly suspicious"". But, he submitted, it could not amount to proof beyond reasonable doubt of the offence charged. In particular, he submitted that the reasonable possibility that Mr Hobbs had the drugs in the boot before he attended at the restaurant cannot be ruled out.

49He reiterated his attack on the evidence of Detective Mackay and Detective Kiem. He submitted that the direction in the summing-up that I have extracted was correct. In other words, he submitted that the propositions that Mr Hobbs had indeed been seen to have something in his hand when he left the vehicle of the applicant the second time (as sworn to by Detective Mackay), and that Mr Hobbs had indeed been seen standing at the boot of his vehicle moving around an esky (as sworn to by Detective Kiem), were indispensable intermediate facts that needed to be proven beyond reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the tribunal of fact before a verdict of guilty could be returned. He relied upon the well-known decision of Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) [1984] HCA 7; (1984) 153 CLR 521. 

50He submitted in short that this Court, undertaking its own independent evaluation of the whole of the evidence, including the surveillance video, would not permit the conviction to stand.

51The Crown submitted that the evidence of Detective Mackay, far from being of great assistance to the Crown case, left it open to valid criticism. But he submitted that an examination of all of the evidence in the Crown case, looked at in its entirety, amply supported the verdict of guilty. He submitted that the evidence of Detective Kiem was substantially less amenable to criticism than the evidence of Detective Mackay.

52As for the direction that elevated the thrust of the evidence of the two detectives to the level of being indispensable intermediate facts, he submitted that that direction of her Honour was wrong. The Crown case, he submitted, was a circumstantial one, and there was a plethora of evidence, even if one were to discount fully the evidence of the two detectives, that there had been an illicit exchange between Mr Hobbs and the applicant of the drugs found in the boot of the Nissan. The evidence of the two detectives was not ""a link in the chain"". There was nothing about that evidence, or the Crown case as a whole, that required acceptance of it to the criminal standard at an intermediate stage of analysis.

53His ancillary submission about the direction was as follows. Because the jury returned a verdict of guilty, it must be that the jury was indeed satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the evidence of Detective Mackay and Detective Kiem. That finding has an important role to play with regard to the ground, because the jury had the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses give evidence, in contrast to the position of this Court. He submitted that, in combination with the verdict, the direction (although wrongful) served to show that the jury had made a positive finding about the credibility of both police officers that this Court would be very slow to contradict.

Determination

Applicable legal principle

54There is no need for me to recount the development of the jurisprudence of the High Court of Australia with regard to this ground. It commenced in modern times with M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487; developed in subsequent cases such as MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 and R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618; and culminated most recently in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400. Although there have been changes in terminology, and emphasis, the fundamental task of this Court with regard to such a ground has not been the subject of radical reformulation over the past 19 years.

55Nor is there a need to quote at length from the judgments. It suffices to set out a number of basal propositions derived from the judgment of the plurality in SKA v The Queen.

56First, the starting point is that the jury is, in our criminal justice system, the primary body entrusted with resolving questions of guilt or innocence. In fulfilling that role, the jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses give evidence.

57Secondly, the question is whether this Court thinks that the evidence was such that it was open to the jury to be satisfied that the guilt of the applicant had been proven beyond reasonable doubt.

58Thirdly, the question is not whether there was, at law, evidence to sustain the conviction. That is a separate question.

59Fourthly, this Court must undertake an independent analysis of the evidence as a whole, both ""as to its sufficiency and quality"". In doing so, this Court must undertake a weighing up of any competing evidence.

60Fifthly, a doubt experienced by this Court will be, in most cases, a doubt that should have been shared by the jury. An exception to that proposition arises when the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by this Court.

My approach to the disputed matters

61As I have said, the surveillance video was played in open court more than once. It certainly shows the presence and movements of the two vehicles and of the applicant and Mr Hobbs at the restaurant. It does show that, on the first occasion that Mr Hobbs moved from his motor vehicle to the motor vehicle of the applicant, Mr Hobbs had something in his hand. However, as for the stage when Mr Hobbs left the vehicle of the applicant the second time and returned to his own motor vehicle, I was simply unable to see clearly whether anything was in his hand or not.

62Secondly, the criticisms of the evidence of Detective Mackay have a degree of force. It will be recalled that, despite his evidence that he saw something noteworthy and important, he made no mention of it to his colleagues at the time, and made no other record of having seen it. Indeed, he explicitly said in the commentary that he had not seen that very event. His explanations in the witness box for that state of affairs did not demand acceptance. Whilst making no finding confirmatory of the allegations of senior counsel for the applicant, I am comfortable in putting the evidence of Detective Mackay to one side, and analysing the ground on the basis of the other evidence.

63Thirdly, it is true that the criticisms of the evidence of Detective Kiem are not as powerful. But it is very unfortunate that the objective record in the form of a video recording of what was said to have occurred at the boot of the Nissan shows nothing of what Detective Kiem says she observed. It is also important that, when giving evidence some months before about what she had observed, Detective Kiem had sworn to significant things that were inconsistent with what the surveillance video showed. In all the circumstances, whilst I do not put her evidence to one side, I do not accord it substantial probative weight.

64I am quite aware that, in light of the direction in the summing-up and the verdict, that approach of mine must be different from that adopted by the jury. I shall return to that divergence, if necessary, later in my judgement.

65My approach to the evidence of those two witnesses calls for consideration at this stage of the submission by senior counsel for the applicant that this Court, in its evaluation of the evidence, is fettered by the direction given by her Honour to the jury. That is because acceptance of such a submission would mean that, as a result of my approach to the evidence of the two witnesses, the ground must be upheld.

The direction

66I respectfully consider that the direction was incorrect and should not have been given.

67The Crown case was a circumstantial one. It relied upon all of the evidence to establish the proposition that, on the day and at the place of particularised in the indictment, the applicant had supplied not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. That could potentially be proven in a number of ways. Not the least of them were: the telephone conversations before and after the meeting; the transmission and receipt of the SMS messages; the undisputed behaviour of the applicant and Mr Hobbs at Hungry Jack's; the behaviour of Mr Hobbs after the meeting; and all of the items located in his motor vehicle.

68It is certainly the case that acceptance of the proposition that Mr Hobbs was seen to leave the vehicle of the applicant the second time with something in his hand would bolster the Crown case. But acceptance of the proposition was not an essential prerequisite for proof of the offence. Nor was acceptance of the proposition that, shortly after he left the vehicle of the applicant, Mr Hobbs was seen to be standing at the boot of his motor vehicle doing something with an esky. Still less was acceptance of either of those propositions to the criminal standard necessary, and an indispensable intermediate point upon the path towards the destination of being satisfied to the same standard that the offence had been proven.

69The disputed observations of which the two detectives gave evidence were matters that the jury needed to evaluate, along with all of the other facts, to determine whether the offence had been made out to the criminal standard. The two disputed events were not, in my opinion, in a special category.

70In short, considering the matters that were the subject of the direction, in the context both of all of the other evidence in the case and the count in the indictment, I respectfully consider that it was an error to direct the jury as her Honour did. The question that then arises is whether, in its independent evaluation of the whole of the evidence for the purposes of the ground, this Court is constrained to apply a direction that it considers to be wrong.

71The parties did not provide the Court with authorities as to the correct approach to the direction. But it is noteworthy that, in discussing a direction that a trial judge had given to a jury limiting the temporal basis upon which a verdict of guilty could be founded, the plurality in SKA v The Queen said at [22]: 

""On appeal, the task of the Court of Criminal Appeal was to make an independent assessment of the whole of the evidence, to determine whether the verdicts of guilty could be supported. There is no doubt that the Court of Criminal Appeal was not bound by the ruling of the trial judge concerning the date of the 2006 offences. However, the Court of Criminal Appeal was required to form an opinion as to the date of the 2006 offences in order to weigh the whole of the evidence.""

72I do not accept the proposition that this Court, having come to the view that an error occurred at first instance with regard to a direction, should compound that error on appeal. Having come to the conclusion that the direction about indispensable intermediate facts was wrong, it would be remarkable if this Court were required, in effect, to direct itself in accordance with it. 

73In short, I am persuaded that the direction should not have been given. I do not consider that it fetters the approach of this Court to the evidence. Therefore I do not consider that my approach to the evidence of the two witnesses intrinsically leads to the success of the ground.

Evaluation of evidence

74I consider that a number of inferences can be drawn from the undisputed evidence.

75First, before the afternoon of 29 January 2009, a meeting was in the process of being set up at which an illicit transaction was to take place whereby the applicant would give or sell something to Mr Hobbs. I refer to the fact that the applicant was to meet a man whose mobile number he did not possess; that neither he nor Mr Farrar referred by name to that man at any stage; that Mr Farrar, with the concurrence of the applicant, referred to what was to occur elliptically on the telephone; that there were numerical references in the conversations between Mr Farrar and the applicant; that the applicant and Mr Hobbs communicated only by short SMS messages before the meeting, although each had the mobile telephone number of the other; and that, in the first conversation, the applicant referred guardedly to the fact that he ""should have it all serviced for him."" The latter statement shows that the applicant was intending to provide something that required preparation to Mr Hobbs.

76Secondly, I am satisfied that the illicit event that had been arranged did come to fruition. The movements of the applicant and Mr Hobbs, and of their vehicles, support that proposition, including of course that Mr Hobbs entered the vehicle of the applicant not once but twice. So does the fact that, on the first occasion, Mr Hobbs entered the vehicle of the applicant with something in his hand.

77Thirdly, it was impossible for Mr Hobbs to obtain the illicit drugs between the time when he left the restaurant and the time when he was arrested and they were found in the boot of his motor vehicle. That is because, as I have said, he was under continuous surveillance. That means that he possessed the drugs when he drove away from the Hungry Jack's. Is it reasonably possible that he possessed the drugs before he arrived there?

78The inference can be drawn that the Pulse Pharmacy shopping bag in which the drugs were located was obtained at 1:21pm. It would be unlikely (though not impossible) for a person to obtain an item such as illicit drugs before 1.21pm and thereafter place that item in a shopping bag that was purchased subsequently. Furthermore, if it be the case that Mr Hobbs possessed the illicit drugs before he arrived at Westfield Parramatta, and left them in his vehicle some time shortly after 12.49pm whilst he walked through the shopping centre with his female companion, that would be a strangely risky thing to do with regard to so valuable a commodity.

79It is true that the police did not have Mr Hobbs under surveillance before he arrived at the Hungry Jack's. It is also true that quite some time passed between the time when Mr Hobbs was observed at the shopping centre and when he arrived at the fast food restaurant. Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that it was quite possible that he had obtained the drugs after being at the shopping centre and before arriving at the restaurant. But in analysing that proposition one may query why a person would be driving around with a very valuable quantity of drugs stashed in his boot; why he would be leaving it there to enter a fast food restaurant with his companion; and why, on two occasions thereafter, he would be leaving it to enter the vehicle of a person whom he did not know.

80Furthermore, in determining whether what had occurred at the restaurant involved the applicant supplying Mr Hobbs with the drugs in question, it is important to recall two aspects of the telephone conversations that took place between Mr Farrar and the applicant after the meeting. The first was a reference by Mr Farrar to whether or not the applicant had received ""the five 0"". The second was the concern expressed by Mr Farrar and the applicant about the inability to contact Mr Hobbs after the meeting.

81The first reference supports the inference that the applicant had received something that can be expressed numerically from Mr Hobbs at the meeting. That item could, perhaps, be a firearm (expressed numerically by way of its calibre or other characteristic), or illicit drugs (expressed numerically with regard to weight, whether by way of the metric system or the imperial system). And it certainly could be a substantial sum of money: $50,000. It will be recalled that the police expert gave evidence that the drugs found in the boot of the Nissan were worth between $70,000 and $80,000.

82As for the second aspect, it is open to the interpretation that Mr Farrar and the applicant were concerned that Mr Hobbs may have been arrested, and that that event could have adverse consequences for themselves. That may include, for example, Mr Hobbs inculpating them verbally. It could also include them being inculpated by something found to be in the possession of Mr Hobbs on arrest.

83It is also noteworthy that Mr Hobbs obtained the ice from the service station directly after his meeting with the applicant, and not before it.

84It is true that a sum such as $50,000 is not precisely consistent with the estimate of value provided in the expert evidence of the police officer. It is also true that the finding of $10,000 cash in the glove box of Mr Hobbs is not explained on the Crown case. It is also true that no scientific evidence linked the applicant with the items found in the motor vehicle. Finally, because the applicant was not arrested until some months later, there is no evidence that he possessed very soon after the meeting any item (such as a large amount of cash) that is supportive of the Crown case. I have taken into account all of those countervailing factors, but do not regard them as determinative.

85Reflecting upon all of the evidence as a whole, I consider that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, on the date and at the place particularised in the indictment, the applicant had supplied a commercial quantity of the prohibited drug to Mr Hobbs. In particular, I consider that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant supplied to Mr Hobbs the quantity of methylamphetamine located in the boot of the motor vehicle of Mr Hobbs.

86Evaluating all of the evidence that I have recounted, I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the applicant of the count contained in the indictment. To be clear, I have come to that conclusion even though, as part of my evaluation of the evidence, I have put the evidence of Detective Mackay to one side, and accorded the evidence of Detective Kiem little probative value.

87In light of my own satisfaction that the offence has been proven beyond reasonable doubt, there is no need for me to revisit the issue discussed in [64] with regard to the evidence of the two detectives. That is because there is no doubt on my part that requires resolution in accordance with the fifth proposition in [60].

88It follows that I would grant leave to appeal against the conviction, but dismiss the appeal against conviction. 

Appeal against sentence

89The Crown agrees with the proposition of the applicant that the commencement date of the sentence should be 14 January 2011 as opposed to 29 May 2011. The submission of the applicant is founded upon a detailed examination of his custodial history, and the reasons why he was in custody at various points. Because of the position of the Crown, there is no need for this Court to engage in an analysis of that history. In light of the concession by the Crown, I consider that it is appropriate for the adjustment sought by the applicant to be made.

Orders

90I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal against conviction granted.

(2)Appeal against conviction dismissed.

(3)Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 

(4)Appeal against sentence allowed.

(5)Quash the commencement date of the sentence of 29 May 2011.

(6)In substitution, impose a new commencement date of 14 January 2011. As a result, the first date upon which the applicant will be eligible for release upon parole will be 13 January 2015.

		11 March 2013",2013-03-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761090,Edwards v R [2013] NSWCCA 54,"Judgment
1JOHNSON J:  I agree with Harrison J.
2HARRISON J: The applicant came before Flannery DCJ for sentence on 30 March 2012 following his plea of guilty to four counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial benefit by deception contrary to s 134.2 Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).  The maximum penalty for each offence is 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $66,000.  Four further offences on a s 16BA schedule were taken into account.  The applicant was sentenced to a total head sentence of imprisonment for 4 years and 3 months commencing on 30 March 2012 and expiring on 29 June 2016 with a non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months expiring on 29 May 2014.
3The applicant seeks leave to appeal to this Court against the severity of the sentence imposed by her Honour on several grounds.  The applicant specifically abandoned grounds 11 and 12 at the hearing of his application in this Court.  The remaining 10 grounds of appeal are referred to later in these reasons.
4Her Honour found that between 9 July 2004 and 4 January 2006 the applicant had lodged 27 Business Activity Statements with the Australian Tax Office in which he falsely claimed refunds for goods and services tax to which he was not entitled.  These statements were lodged by the applicant on behalf of three companies of which he was the sole director and shareholder and on behalf of himself personally.  The statements were based on a claimed total business expenditure of $6,726,852 reported for four of his businesses.  The figure was a complete fabrication, as the nominated entities were not engaged in any trading.
5The applicant claimed total GST refunds of $540,898.  He received $380,724 relating to counts 1 to 4 on the indictment.  Four claims totalling $160,174 were stopped before any payment was made.  The applicant was not entitled to any of these monies.
6The applicant appeared without legal assistance in this Court by video link from Cessnock Gaol.  With limited exceptions, he relied upon his written submissions without significant additional oral argument.
Ground 1:  Her Honour was not properly informed due to incompetent representation by the appellant's legal team    
7The Crown has characterised this ground as a complaint that the applicant was incompetently represented at the sentencing proceedings so as to lead to a miscarriage of justice in accordance with the relevant authorities.  Whether or not that perception is correct, the applicant offered no submissions under this ground that advanced such a contention.  He has not set out what are said to be the facts, material or circumstances that were allegedly not drawn to her Honour's attention at the time or how that led to an unjust result.
8The applicant was represented at the sentencing proceedings by counsel and solicitor.  He gave evidence.  I am not able to discern from the applicant's submissions what, if any, particular or general allegations of professional incompetence he purports to rely upon in aid of the present ground.  The Crown has taken a somewhat beneficial approach to these submissions and has identified two matters that might qualify as complaints of this type.  One is counsel's failure to object to her Honour seeing an inaccurate bail record that included at least one serious matter with which the applicant had been charged but in respect of which he had not been convicted at the time of the sentencing proceedings.  The other was related to the issues raised in grounds 11 and 12 that have been abandoned.
9Her Honour indicated that she would not take into account any then current matters that were disclosed in the applicant's criminal history. Her Honour's remarks on sentence contain nothing that either expressly or by implication suggests that she did so.  Her reference to the applicant's criminal history was cursory and in any event concluded with a finding that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable.  Having regard to the seriousness of the then outstanding matter it is apparent that it formed no part of her Honour's assessment of the applicant or the sentence that she imposed.
10It is clear from R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685 that this Court has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice.  What amounts to such a miscarriage has to be considered in the light of the way in which the criminal justice system operates.  In that case, Gleeson CJ said this:
""As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence.
However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of 'flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice.  It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision.  When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.""
11In Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; (2006) 80 ALJR 614; 162 A Crim R 301, Gummow and Hayne JJ said at [25]:
""... But an appeal against conviction must ultimately focus upon the trial and conviction of the accused person not the professional standards of the accused's counsel. Was what happened, or did not happen, at trial a miscarriage of justice?""
12Their Honours continued at [27] in these terms:
""... For the reasons given in TKWJ, the inquiry about miscarriage must be an objective inquiry, not an examination of what trial counsel for an accused did or did not know or think about. The critical question is what did or did not happen at trial, not why that came about.""
13In TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; (2002) 212 CLR 124 at [79], McHugh J said:
""... Accordingly, 'it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence'. The appellant must show that the failing or error of counsel was a material irregularity and that there is a significant possibility that it affected the outcome of the trial.""
14These principles have been applied in sentencing proceedings: see Munro v R [2006] NSWCCA 350 at [23] - [24].
15I have reviewed the transcript of the sentencing proceedings and her Honour's remarks on sentence in some detail.  I am unable to discern any relationship between anything done or not done by counsel appearing for the applicant and the existence of a possible miscarriage of justice.  At least one significant reason for this is to be found in the very fair and balanced way that her Honour dealt with the applicant's counsel and with the case he was presenting for the applicant.  His failure to object to the tender of material that included reference to the fact that the applicant was facing serious charges may have been unfortunate but it did not in the scheme of the proceedings as a whole amount to a material irregularity.  Moreover, and in my view critically, the error did not give rise to a possibility, let alone a significant possibility, that the outcome of the sentencing proceedings was thereby adversely affected.
16The applicant has not established that there was even the faintest possibility that the conduct of his counsel led to a miscarriage of justice.  This ground is not made out.
Ground 2:  Her Honour failed to consider the appellant's accountant was actually bankrupt himself and unreliable in advice. (Incompetent legal)
17This ground appears to raise the importance of alleged shortcomings of the applicant's accountant and the fact that the applicant relied on his advice when committing the subject offences.  The applicant referred to what he described as his own ""fiscal naivety"" in oral submissions in this Court.  That phrase is also to be found in a pre-sentence report prepared by Michael Taylor that was tendered before her Honour.  Mr Taylor said this concerning the applicant's attitude to the offences:
""Whilst verbalising an acceptance of his guilt, so far as he considers himself 'ultimately responsible' for his company's financial circumstances, Mr Edwards tended to claim some fiscal naivety and shift some blame to poor advice/guidance he received from an accountant.  He claimed that he is most concerned and worried about the consequences of these proceedings.""
18A later pre-sentence report written by Trevor Rogers indicated that:
""When questioned regarding the offences before the Court, he appeared to minimise his accountability by continuing to deflect blame upon incorrect advice he had apparently been given.""
19Her Honour did not accept this.  She referred to the applicant's concerns in her sentencing remarks as follows:
""... Mr Gleeson who appeared for the offender, although accepting that the offences were serious, pointed to his client's evidence that he had committed the offences to keep afloat his legitimate business, which employed six people, after it started to suffer financially in 2004, in seeking to dispute the Crown assertion that the offences were committed for reasons of greed.
...
However, he gave a different explanation, not only to the author of the pre-sentence report of 10 September 2010, but also to the author of the pre-sentence report of 14 November 2010, to the effect that he had received poor advice or guidance from an accountant.  An explanation that is hard to reconcile with the explanation he now gives, unsupported as it is by any detail or documentary evidence.
It is also difficult to understand how an accountant could be blamed for what were blatant frauds upon the Tax office.""
20The applicant submitted that he obtained an affidavit prior to the sentencing hearing and presented it to his legal team outlining the shortcomings of his accountant.  That affidavit was not relied upon before her Honour.  It has not been referred to in this Court.  An affidavit by Scott Andrew Atkins sworn 17 February 2012 that was relied upon at the hearing of this appeal does not advance the applicant's claim that he received poor advice from his accountant.
21In his written submissions, the applicant maintained that he ""was of the understanding that his companies were able to trade with each other"".  His submissions make reference to having ""consulted his accountant in 2009 as per file and attached affidavit.""  However, the offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty were completed by no later than April 2006.  The applicant said that he ""ultimately signed all tax office submissions and accepted responsibility"" but ""was unclear as to if he acted 'recklessly' or not, hence committing and guilty of fraud"".  
22The applicant makes no comprehensible case of reliance on any specified poor advice that led him to commit the offences.  There was in fact no evidence before her Honour that the applicant's accountant or financial adviser had given him any particular advice at all, and certainly no evidence of the respects in which he alleged that such advice was faulty.  Her Honour was entitled to form and to express the views that she did.  There is no basis to find that any miscarriage of justice occurred in the circumstances.  This ground is not made out.
Ground 3:  Her Honour did not consider the offender committed one act of recklessness or error
23The applicant's submissions in support of this ground were brief and in the following terms:
""The appellant admitted at the earliest instance January 2006 that he had made a 'mistake' or error outlined in detail in the previous submission No 2.  This offence should be considered as one of error of judgment as the offender's companies were not set up to correctly trade with each other.  The appellant was fiscally and naïve as he explained in his pre-sentence reports, also the appellant relied on poor advice as supported in the affidavit.""
24The offending conduct occurred over a period from October 2004 to April 2006.  Dishonesty is an element of the offence.  The applicant pleaded guilty.  The statement of facts tendered before her Honour included the following material:
""21.  On 9 January 2006 the ATO contacted the Offender in order to verify the lodgement and non-capital purchases of $249,304 claimed in the BAS lodged for Security Broker for the period October-December 2005.
22.  In answering the ATO's questions, the Offender spoke in some detail about the nature of this business.  He stated that it was a new business that had recently started up selling monitored security alarms.  He claimed that the business turned over $250,000 in sales, and that he was responsible for preparing the BASs for this business.  The Offender stated that he would like to check the BAS to see if it contained any mistakes.
23.  On 13 January 2006 a fax was received from the Offender stating that he had made an error on the October to December 2005 BAS for Security Broker, and his refund should be reduced from $19,274 to Nil.  The explanation given was 'The non-capital purchases were made on account and their payment did not actually fall in this quarter.'
24.  In January 2006 the ATO advised the Offender that a number of his entities were now under review and requested he make his business records available to the ATO for review.  The Offender replied that he could not address the issue for six weeks as he was too busy at that time.  He was asked to furnish his bank statements in the interim, however nothing was ever received by the ATO to support any of the claims.
25.  Despite repeated attempts by the ATO, contact with the Offender could not be re-established.  The Offender's business telephone number was subsequently disconnected.""
25The offences involved ""more than a degree of planning"" as her Honour found.  The applicant's scheme was not, however, particularly sophisticated.  Whatever be the most accurate characterisation of the offences, they could not on any reasonable view be described as one act of recklessness.  This ground is not made out.
Ground 4:  Her Honour should have allowed for the appellant cooperating with law enforcement authorities
26Section 16A(2)(h) of the Crimes Act 1914 is in these terms:
""(2) In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court:
...
(h) the degree to which the person has co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or of other offences;...""
27Her Honour made the following finding:
""The offender did not cooperate with law enforcement agencies, although he did indicate that he was now prepared to make arrangements to repay the money.""
28Her Honour did not fall into error.  This ground is not made out.
Ground 5:  Her Honour did not consider the first instance punishment the ATO inflicted on the appellant
Ground 6:  Her Honour did not consider the delay from January 2006 - September 2008
29The applicant contended that he had suffered as the result of ""the protracted nature of the ATO bringing any proceedings to a head.""  He submitted that it ""was almost three years before [he] was raided and informed of any investigation and almost five years before charges or proceedings started.""  He submitted that by this time he ""had dealt with the debt by way of bankruptcy and suffered significant stress and social issues in his life as [he] stated in evidence"".  He said, ""the brakes had been applied to all aspects of [his] life"".  He relied upon what was said by Tim Watson-Munro in his report dated 12 March 2012 when he said:
""Certainly the protracted nature of these proceedings appears to have had a telling impact upon him to the point where he is now seeing a psychiatrist on a regular basis and being treated with psychotropic medication for his sleep.""
30Street CJ stated the relevant principles in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 as follows:
""Moreover, where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence, to the circumstances that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense and to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on subsequent occasion, and to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach - passage of time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner.""
31This principle has been affirmed by the High Court in Mill v R [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59.
32It is clear that her Honour did take account of the delay in this matter.  She discounted the significance of delay in the period between January 2006 and September 2008.  She explained her reasons for doing so in these terms:
""The offences were committed between 9 July 2004 and 4 January 2006.  As the facts indicate, an audit was conducted in February 2006 and the matter was then referred to the criminal section of the Tax Office.  In September 2008, an officer from the Tax Office was present during the execution of a  search warrant at the offender's house.  He spoke to the offender and told him that criminal proceedings were most likely going to be instituted.
The offender was charged on 19 April 2010.  Unlike McGuiness [2008] NSWCCA 80, this is not a case where an offender after making full admissions of guilt to the Tax Office and entering into an arrangement to repay the agency, is lulled into a belief that the matter will be resolved without the intervention of the criminal law.
However, as the offender was left in what the authorities describe as uncertain suspense between September 2008 and April 2010 and, as sentencing for stale crimes calls for a flexibility of approach, it being in the public interest that those suspected of serious crime be brought to justice quickly, I propose to take the delay between September 2008 and April 2010 into account when sentencing the offender.""
33The applicant has not attempted to demonstrate, in the light of these remarks, and the clear indication that her Honour knew and understood the authorities, and applied them in this case, how she fell into any error.  I do not consider that she did so.  These grounds are not made out.
Ground 7:  Her Honour did not consider the loss of profession of the appellant. (Again the appellant's legal team and Crown were informed prior to sentence)
34Prior to his conviction the applicant worked in the security industry.  He maintains that his anticipated inability to renew his security licence or to find work in that industry should have been taken into account in his favour by her Honour when passing sentence.
35However, no evidence of this contention was led at the sentencing hearing.  The applicant did give evidence of his work in ""security and electrical"" and of having worked in ""security"".  That was the extent of any evidence in this respect.
36Undoubtedly a court can take account of extra-curial punishment amounting to the ""loss or detriment imposed on an offender by persons other than the sentencing court, for the purpose of punishing the offender for his offence or at least by reason of the offender having committed the offence"": Silvano v R (2008) 184 A Crim R 593 at [29].  Such an approach necessarily requires the existence of evidence upon the basis of which to proceed.  There was none in this case.
37This ground is also not made out.
Ground 8:  Her Honour did not consider that the offender had excellent prospects of rehabilitation
38Her Honour's finding was relevantly as follows:
""It is hard to be too optimistic about the offender's prospects of rehabilitation in circumstances where I have not accepted his explanation for committing the offences.  However, he is forty, his offending commenced at a relatively advanced stage of his life, he is seeing a psychologist for his problems and Mr Watson-Munro has some optimism that if he continues to have the support that he presently has, his prognosis is positive.  In those circumstances, I accept that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable.""
39It is entirely understandable that the applicant should not agree with her Honour's opinion.  However, her finding that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable is discretionary.  The applicant has not identified, and I am otherwise unable to find, any basis upon which it could be suggested that her discretion miscarried.  This ground is not made out.
Ground 9:  Calculating the degree of criminality
40The applicant submitted that his degree of criminality should be regarded as ""low"".  Counsel for the applicant at the sentencing hearing conceded that the objective seriousness of the offences was ""clear[ly] high"".  Her Honour referred to the submissions of counsel for both sides on this topic in her remarks on sentence.  Her conclusions were stated in this way:
""I agree with the Crown that the offender's criminality is significant, as the period over which each count was committed was months, rather than days or weeks; the amounts the subject of counts 1, 2 and 3 were not insignificant; the commission of the offences involved more than a degree of planning, although I accept not much sophistication as once registered for GST, a refund can be claimed by lodging the Business Activity Statement without the need to lodge any supporting documentation, and, as I have found that at least the bulk of the proceeds of the offences were used by him for his own purposes.""
41Her Honour imposed partially cumulative sentences.  She was clearly aware that she was dealing with offences that formed part of a course of conduct and that she was required to sentence in accordance with Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610.
42The applicant has not identified any error in her Honour's approach.  This ground is not made out.
Ground 10:  Her Honour erred when considering custody and recognizance released order
43The applicant submitted that his case involved ""exceptional and very special circumstances"" and that ""a custodial sentence when considering all the circumstances is unjust and unsafe.""  For reasons that will by now be apparent, that submission is entirely without merit and should be rejected.  The decision of this Court in O'Meara v R [2009] NSWCCA 90 should be noted in this context.
44This ground is not made out.
Orders
45In my opinion the following orders should be made:
1. Grant leave to appeal against sentence.
  2.  Dismiss the appeal. 
46ADAMSON J:  I agree with Harrison J.

2761102,R v Clarke [2013] NSWDC 335,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Ms Clarke, my practice is to tell people in advance what sentence I propose to impose. In your case in respect of the accessory after the fact to the armed robbery I propose to sentence you to one year, seven months and two weeks imprisonment which will be suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In respect of the offence of receiving stolen property I propose to sentence you to twelve months imprisonment, that too will be suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I will explain in the course of my remarks on sentencing but had I imposed full term custodial sentences in relation to those sentences, there would have been partial accumulation of one sentence on the other, but it would not have amounted to a sentence of imprisonment of more than two years.
	
	
	You can take a seat thank you very much and I will release you from custody when you agree to the undertaking that I will be asking of you.
	
	
	In the Court of Criminal Appeal decision of Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121, the then learned Chief Judge at Common Law Justice Wood discussed a number of matters relevant to the then Crown appeal at Bar concerning the relevance of rehabilitation in the sentencing of offenders. I raise this matter in the context of the very helpful submissions provided to me by the learned Crown Prosecutor about the purposes of sentencing which appear in s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the oft quoted remarks of the majority of the Court in Veen (No 2) v R the decision of the High Court in 1988 where four of the seven purposes of sentencing now in s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were identified and were said sometimes to be signposts pointing in opposing directions.
	
	
	Justice Wood in Blackman and Walters was considering a very serious case of home invasion where a number of very serious crimes were committed, where the sentencing judge had in respect of at least two of the respondents to the Crown appeal fixed terms of imprisonment which were suspended pursuant to the then recently introduced s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I draw no parallels with that sentencing exercise and this as such. The case involved far different criminality than that with which I am now concerned. But what the learned Chief Judge approved in his remarks on sentencing were the observations of the late Chief Justice King in the decision of Yardley and Betts. In that judgment from the full Bench of the South Australian Supreme Court in 1979 he extracted this statement of principle, which he adopted:
	


“The protection of the community is also contributed to by the successful rehabilitation of offenders. This aspect of sentencing should never be lost sight of and it assumes a particular importance in the case of first offenders and others who have not developed settled criminal habits. If a sentence had the effect of turning an offender towards a criminal way of life, the protection of the community is to that extent impaired. If the sentence induces or assists an order (sic) to avoid offending in future the protection of the community is to that extent enhanced. To say that the criminal law exists for the protection of the community is not to say that severity is to be regarded as the sentencing norm.”


	
	Of course as the Crown and I discussed the purposes of sentencing in s 3A, all of which I have to take into account in this sentencing exercise, will not necessarily be accorded the same weight. In some sentencing exercises some of the purposes of sentencing will be totally irrelevant. It is the case, as was submitted by learned counsel for the accused, that a term of imprisonment, albeit suspended, carries with it in the appropriate case an inherent quality of deterrence both personal and general and such is the case here. I must say in passing that I do not believe the prisoner is a threat to the community and thus protection of the community from the offender is a matter of little moment.
	
	
	This prisoner pleaded guilty to two offences committed in March 2012. One was an offence of accessory after the fact to robbery, the robbery being committed whilst the principal offender was armed with an offensive weapon and the other offence was receiving stolen property. The maximum penalty pursuant to s 349(2) Crimes Act 1900 in relation to the accessory after the fact offence, I am informed and I take it as correct, is a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. There is no standard non‑parole period. The receiving offence carries a maximum penalty pursuant to s 188 (1) Crimes Act 1900 a ten year imprisonment maximum penalty, there is no standard non‑parole period.
	
	
	The prisoner pleaded guilty to both offences in the Local Court and there is no dispute that the prisoner is entitled to a discount of twenty-five per cent upon the otherwise appropriate sentence for the utilitarian benefit of a plea of guilty pursuant to the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton and other cases that have been decided since.
	
	
	The principal crime, if I may call it simply armed robbery, was committed at Sylvania on 5 March. It was the armed robbery of a chemist shop where the principal offender was armed with a tyre iron and the principal offender stole a sum of cash, the facts say $2,000, and a quantity of prescription medication. The statement of facts goes into a great deal of detail about matters pertinent to the identification of the prisoner and the co-accused as the principal offenders and the character of the offence committed by the principal offender who is Khalil Nadji, a gentleman who had known the prisoner since childhood and had been living with her in her public accommodation at Caringbah for a period of two months before the commission of the offence. The relevance of the prisoner’s subjective circumstances to the manner in which, and the reason for which, this crime was committed I will deal with shortly.
	
	
	The statement of facts says at its conclusion that the prisoner, who was present in the car park a short distance from the pharmacy, in fact in her own car, did not intentionally encourage or assist the co-accused prior to or at the time of the commission of the offence and it is clear from two sources that the prisoner was concerned as to the fact that her then partner was contemplating committing some crime within the pharmacy and that she did not know precisely what he was going to do. The sources of information in relation to those matters include a statement she made to the police in her electronic interview of 15 March 2012 and in the observations of some eyewitnesses who referred to the prisoner and the principal arguing in the vicinity of the car before the principal went to commit the crime. The medication that was stolen from the pharmacy, whilst Mr Nadji was armed with the tyre iron or lever, was Xanax. It would appear that the prisoner and Mr Nadji were abusers of that medication as well as other drugs and medication at the relevant time.
	
	
	I do not wish to lessen the seriousness of the conduct of Mr Nadji but there is no need for me to relate that in any great detail. When he is, I would imagine, ultimately convicted, the facts of that aspect of the matter will be more pertinent bearing in mind the prisoner was unaware of the fact that he was going to conduct himself in the way that he is alleged to have done.
	
	
	After the crime was committed the prisoner and Mr Nadji returned to her premises at Caringbah. As I said these were public housing premises that she had resided in for a period of seven years. He had only resided there for a couple of months. She received $500 in cash and a half packet of Xanax. These are the items that constitute the stolen property that she received.
	
	
	The circumstances of her accessorial liability include travelling away from the pharmacy with the principal offender, falsely calling the police to report that her car was stolen and also speaking to a Triple‑0 operator at 5.24am the following morning to report that the car had been found and providing assistance to the principal offender when inquiries were made by police in relation to the reported stealing of the motor vehicle. The reason that the false story had been given of the theft of the motor vehicle was the concern that the prisoner and the principal offender had that the car that was registered in the name of this prisoner would be identified as having an association with the robbery.
	
	
	In part, of course, it might be said that the prisoner’s conduct was to aid Nadji and thus attract assessorial liability, but there also was, it should be fairly said, some proportion of her responsibility in that regard, pointing to her concern that she should not falsely be implicated in the crime that Mr Nadji had committed within the pharmacy.
	
	
	Police eventually, as was made clear from the evidence of the officer‑in‑charge, pieced together the falsity of the versions that the prisoner and Mr Nadji had given. They noticed things like a missing tyre lever or iron from the boot consistent with that having been taken from the boot to be used in the robbery. They pieced together of course the description of Mr Nadji very close to his appearance and also there was evidence of his association with Ms Clarke over a period of time in other matters.
	
	
	The prosecution case against Mr Nadji would appear to be very strong with evidence of identification, evidence of similar description and the evidence of the prisoner in due course, if it is required. It should be fairly said that a person of Mr Khalil Nadji’s ethnicity would not be commonly seen around the Fox Village Shopping Centre in Sylvania. It would be most unlikely for someone of similar appearance to Mr Nadji to have been there to have committed the crime.
	
	
	I have a body of material both in relation to the prisoner’s explanation of her involvement in this crime and her subjective circumstances. I have the evidence of the officer-in-charge which detailed the police investigation and the circumstances in which the prisoner was interviewed. I have read the electronic interview over the luncheon adjournment that she gave. In that electronic interview, she being unable to be interviewed on 14 March because she was under the influence of prescription drugs, the prisoner confessed her guilt to the charges that she now faces, implicated Mr Nadji and expressed her willingness to give evidence or assist authorities in relation to the prosecution of him. The relationship with Mr Nadji obviously has ended. At that time he as I would understand was taken into custody although, whether he is still in custody I do not know.
	
	
	The prisoner signed an undertaking today, 15 March 2013, on the first anniversary of her confession, indicating a willingness to give evidence against her “co-accused” and I have a copy of the statement that she signed on 15 March 2012 adopting what she said in the electronic interview and expressing her willingness to give evidence in court.
	
	
	There was some discussion about the character of the discount to which she would be entitled. The situation was that I gave her an indication in general terms of what I thought a global discount should be for her cooperation in the vicinity of ten per cent. I indicated, given that she at this stage is expected to give evidence, that discount could be broken up into two segments, five per cent for past cooperation and five per cent for future cooperation. The learned Crown Prosecutor, whilst generally accepting the figure that I foreshadowed, bearing in mind of course the Crown is not bound by my estimate, and that in any event it is a discretionary matter and is not something that is strictly bound to a particular figure, indicated that the discount of ten per cent should reflect the future cooperation with no discount for past cooperation. With respect to that submission I cannot agree with that. For a start there has been past cooperation. It would be, with the greatest of respect to the learned Crown’s submission, at the very least improper not to accord some discount for past cooperation.
	
	
	In that regard I have referred to s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the matters that are therein set out as being relevant amongst others as indicating matters that are of assistance or indicative of considerations relevant to the assessment of the cooperation with the authorities. From s 23A(1) I note the Court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which an offender has assisted or undertaken to assist law enforcement authorities in the relevant way. The prisoner has both assisted in the past and undertaken to assist in the future, hence the need for recognition of the two separate types of assistance. Relevantly I have taken into account the fact that the prisoner’s assistance has been truthful and generally complete. The nature and extent of the assistance is set out in a detailed confession in the electronic interview, in circumstances I hasten to say, where the police had cobbled together quite a strong case against the co-accused. I have also concluded that assistance provided by the prisoner has been quite timely, the prisoner did prevaricate of course after the event in circumstances, as I pointed out, where she was in part trying to cover her own trail. But when she was first interviewed by the police, not only did she readily confess her own guilt as I have said, but she offered the assistance. This is not a case of a person coming forward weeks or months after the initial interview or charging and arrest to offer to assist with the guidance of legal advice. In that respect, not only was her assistance timely, but it is reflective of the contrition that she expressed in the interview and has expressed in statements made to people that have taken histories from her. I note that she has received no other benefit in relation to her past assistance or any promised future assistance and I note that other matters set out in s 23A(2) do not apply in this matter.
	
	
	The sentencing of the prisoner requires close consideration of her criminal history because in many respects her criminal history and the circumstances of her offending on this occasion are intimately and intricately bound up in her subjective circumstances. The prisoner was born in September 1981 and thus was thirty years of age at the time of the commission of the offence and now thirty-one years of age. She had some appearances in the Children’s Court including appearances for matters of dishonesty. However, as her criminal history makes clear there was then a nine year break in her offending before she came before a court for driving under the influence of alcohol and other drugs for which she was charged on 30 December 2007. Thereinafter followed a series of offences including driving whilst disqualified from holding a motor vehicle driver’s licence, breaking and entering and stealing for which she received a suspended term of imprisonment and for which ultimately she was called up for sentence, receiving stolen property for which she was given a s 9 bond, further offences of breaking and entering, forging or altering prescriptions, two offences of possessing a false document and using a false document to obtain property.
	
	
	The ultimate situation is, as she appears today, that although she was granted bail in relation to the current matters she was charged in respect of a series of offences for which she was convicted in the Sutherland Local Court on 9 August 2012. In June 2012 she was sentenced to a term of imprisonment effectively of eighteen months with a five month non‑parole period. She was in custody from 12 June 2012 until 29 November 2012 but on 27 November 2012 she was granted conditional bail by the Supreme Court of New South Wales and given the fact that she appealed those eighteen month sentences to the District Court and the District Court in Sydney on 13 December 2012 varied the terms of imprisonment imposed by the learned Magistrate to fix a term of imprisonment of five months. Ultimately she spent only seventeen days in prison custody referable to the current matters. The reason that seventeen days is referrable to the current matters is because her bail in relation to the current matters was revoked until such time as the Supreme Court granted her bail on 27 November 2012.
	
	
	On her release to bail and as part of her conditions of bail the prisoner was admitted to a rehabilitation program and the Court has been provided with a number of reports from that program and had the benefit of the evidence of an officer of the program which is located at Guthrie House, an establishment in Enmore. The reports from Guthrie House dated 14 March 2013 set out the character of the program, the nature of what is called the ‘after care’ program which involves regular home visits, structured care plans, weekly supervised urine analysis, court support and other matters and also counselling services and regular contact to prevent relapse. Ms Clarke, on the information provided to the court, has been a residential participant of the program for three and a half months. The Crown has correctly pointed to the fact that that residential time must be taken into account in assessing the appropriate sentence and in the circumstances of the matter I have determined that in conjunction with the seventeen days of prison custody, or remand custody relevant to this matter, ascribing approximately fifty per cent of the time in residential care to pre-sentence custody, that I should factor into the calculation of an appropriate sentence a period of two months.
	
	
	The prisoner’s presence in the Guthrie House program and her reaction to that program has had a significant effect upon the prisoner’s attitude and the reports from the Guthrie House and from a psychologist that has assessed the prisoner whilst in Guthrie House and since speak of the significant progress the prisoner has made. Ms Saxvik who gave oral evidence on behalf of Guthrie House noted the change in the prisoner since her admission to the rehabilitation program and the aspirations of the prisoner in terms of her attempts to regain custody of her children.
	
	
	The prisoner’s dependence upon prescription drugs at the time of the commission of the offences with which I am concerned is of course a contributing factor to her involvement in these matters. An understanding of this however requires some examination of her history. The prisoner grew up in the St George area, she has two full siblings and two half siblings that are somewhat older than her and her full siblings. She had an uneventful family life and there is no suggestion of sexual or physical abuse. However it would appear in her early teens she became a user of prohibited drugs, firstly cannabis and then heroin. She left school at the age of fourteen years and nine months and while she has had some employment, has not had a lengthy history of permanent or full time employment.
	
	
	The psychologist’s report reflects upon lax parental supervision and poor boundary setting for her. She gave a history of living with various boyfriends from the age of twelve to eighteen years. She had a child when she was nineteen years of age and has had four children from the various relationships since that period of time. Three children from her first relationship which was abusive, physically and mentally, and a fourth child from a second relationship. The co-accused, the principal offender, was the third significant relationship of her life. She discovered, in approximately 2007, that one of her children had been abused by one of her partners. The relationship which she was in at that time involved an intimate connection with a person who was amphetamine dependent and this was something that drew her into further drug use. She has told the psychologist that she had what is described as catastrophic coping in the aftermath of her son’s disclosure of sexual abuse and the timing of that catastrophic reaction coincides with the commencement of the course of offending that I have set out from her criminal history.
	
	
	She placed her children in the care of her parents in September 2008 and has been living alone in her accommodation since then apart from living with the particular partners to whom I have referred. In 2009 she attempted to commit suicide by overdosing on benzodiazepine, Xanax and methadone. I point out that she has been methadone dependent it would seem for a period of fifteen years.
	
	
	She suffered kidney failure, she suffered damage to her legs in circumstances that are not made clear but are confirmed by her mother’s reference who noted that she nearly lost her legs at that time. She was hospitalised for six months, however since then she has suffered chronic pain in her legs and has a condition described as dropped foot. She continued unfortunately after her release from hospital to abuse, particularly prescription drugs and particularly the benzodiazepine medication Xanax and it was in this circumstance, dependant upon Xanax, that she became involved in the crimes with which I am concerned. The facts reveal and certainly her confession to the police reveals that her partner was likewise Xanax dependant as well as dependant upon other drugs and the co-accused’s primary purpose in robbing the chemist shop was to obtain, particularly, Xanax.
	
	
	The prisoner in recent years has also been abusing other prescription drugs, particularly a drug called oxycontin, sometimes referred to as ‘hillbilly heroin’. She has attempted a previous residential rehabilitation program with the We Help Ourselves or WHOS program in 2010 but that was unsuccessful. It is clear that the Guthrie House program that she entered as a condition of her Supreme Court bail has had a much better effect upon her and certainly has produced a number of positive results that are reflected in the report.
	
	
	She gives a history of having consumed Xanax before the commission of the offence. There is something of a dispute it is said between the account that she gave the police on 15 March and the report she gave to the Probation and Parole Service officer. She seemed to suggest in the history she gave the Probation and Parole Service officer that she was “asleep” in her car at the time the offence was committed, but it maybe that this is a misunderstanding of the reality of the situation that she was drowsy or affected by the Xanax that she had taken before the offence was committed.
	
	
	Certainly in the history that she gave the police when she was interviewed she spoke of the immediate use of Xanax after it had been obtained from the Probation and Parole Service. The psychologist notes a history of a lifetime since at least childhood of anxiety type symptoms with a number of stresses including the death of close relatives when she was fifteen years of age in a house fire. It notes the psychological reaction to the disclosure by her son of being sexually abused and it notes that her abuse of Xanax was a “maladaptive attempt to cope with feelings of guilt as well as anger towards her ex-partner”.
	
	
	It points out that her attempted suicide, which was a very serious attempt as her lengthy hospitalisation reveals, was a reflection of her isolation and her inability to resolve her feelings of guilt. The psychologist notes that her development of emotion regulation and coping skills has been disturbed since childhood, that she has had a problematic history of intimate relationships leading to physical abuse of herself. She also was involved with a person at the time of the offending who, like her, was heavily self medicating on benzodiazepines and other drugs. The psychologist noted that she was remorseful for her offending and was committed to addressing her main recidivism risks. The main recidivism risk in the psychologist’s report is that she will relapse into benzodiazepine abuse whilst in the community. She has psychological vulnerabilities which need assistance. The report reflects upon Guthrie House’s after care program which will run for up to twelve months and she also needs drug counselling to address her dependence upon Methadone. I note that she receives, as I understand it, something in the order of 190 milligrams a day which is a very heavy dose of Methadone.
	
	
	She will also need psychological therapy to resolve feelings of guilt about the mistreatment of her son. She will need constant screening and is always at risk of drug relapse if the supports that she has at the present time are lost. The psychologist suggested that was she to be incarcerated in relation to this offence the gaoling of her would have jeopardised both her stable accommodation and adversely affect her relationship with her children.
	
	
	In relation to the Probation and Parole Service report it is a report that reflects upon the past history of supervision, bearing in mind the prisoner has had s 9 and s 12 bonds. The Probation and Parole Officer noted that whilst some of her response to supervision had been positive, and overall it could be viewed as that, her supervision in the past had not had any long term impact on her offending behaviour and she had been subject to breach action.
	
	
	Factors related to offending included the mental health issues that arose out of her son’s report of sexual abuse, her suicide attempt and of course her drug dependency. So far as the summary of the prisoner’s situation is concerned the Probation and Parole Service officer noted that the prisoner impressed as “an insightful young woman” who appeared to have had difficulty coping with some traumatic and emotionally difficult events in the past. These negative experiences were related to a substance abuse history and that appeared to be a major factor in her offending behaviour on this occasion. The report states:
	


“Inquiries indicated that Ms Clarke is currently taking responsibility for her behaviour and making a genuine commitment to address these issues. Following her completion at Guthrie House, Ms Clarke has expressed the intention to continue in their after care program. She will also have the benefit of stable accommodation and family support. Additionally she may benefit from ongoing support and guidance from the service in order to ensure that she maintains this commitment and continues to make positive progress.”


	
	She was thought to be suitable for a medium to high level of supervision, particularly to address the completion of the rehabilitation program which includes the after care program particularised in the report, to undertake relapse prevention programs and to continue with appropriate psychological counselling. I note that I have been given a raft of urinalysis results which show that apart from prescribed medication which is known of, particularly methadone, no illegal substances or inappropriate substances have been found in her system.
	
	
	The mother of the prisoner has indicated her support for the prisoner. She confirms the fact that the children of the prisoner are in her care.
	
	
	The submissions from counsel for the accused are largely in writing and the counsel for the accused effectively stressed upon the court the need to be cautious in assessing the objective criminality in the context of the accessorial liability to which the prisoner has admitted. It is to be fairly said that whilst the prisoner was well aware ultimately of the consequences of her partner’s actions, she was not aware of what he proposed to do at the time he committed the offence. She actively assisted him to avoid apprehension for a short period of time but when she was in a state to be interviewed a relatively short period of time after the commission of the offence as I have indicated she made a full and frank confession.
	
	
	The two offences are very intimately bound. The property that she received were the proceeds of the robbery for which she had accessorial liability and I note what has been written in the submissions about that matter. The submissions of counsel for the accused nominate correctly the matters that are to be taken into account as reflecting the accessorial liability of the prisoner.
	
	
	The guideline judgment in Henry is of some assistance albeit it is for the principal offence of armed robbery or probably more relevant to aiders and abetters of the principal offence. Accessories after the fact are to be seen in a somewhat different light because the plea of guilty to that offence and the facts of this case reveal that the prisoner had not encouraged the principal offender to commit the principal offence and had no knowledge of what the principal offender proposed to do.
	
	
	So far as the assistance to the authorities is concerned I have taken that matter into account by reference to s 23 and a range of authorities that deal with this matter. I appreciate more recent authorities than Cartwright cited in the written submissions such as the appeal of Joseph Sukkar and other decisions which reflect upon the appropriate level of discount for cooperation, particularly post the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton. I have already dealt with that matter in the context of the submissions that were put to me by the learned Crown.
	
	
	I am required to take into account of course pre-sentence custody. Of course I am also required to reflect in the appropriate orders the totality of the criminality by reference to the observations of the majority of the High Court in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 particularly at [45]. I hasten to say in the context of having resolved that the terms of imprisonment be suspended, that had I imposed full time terms of custody, as I earlier intimated, I would have partially accumulated one sentence on the other but that would not have led in any event to a term of imprisonment of greater than two years. As I indicated to the parties in the course of the submissions, I am required in fixing the appropriate sentences to have regard to what was said by Justice Howie in the decision of Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 and also in the judgment of Justice Johnson in the decision of Douar from 2005. I am required by having regard to s 5 of the Act to determine whether anything else other than a term of imprisonment is appropriate in relation to each offence. I am required then to fix an appropriate sentence in relation to each offence and then determine how the appropriate sentence should be served. In that regard I have naturally had regard to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In relation to this matter apart from what is self evident from the objective facts of the case, the principle and most relevant “aggravating” factor was that the prisoner’s involvement in the commission of the offence was for financial gain, although in relation to the offence of receiving it is inherently a characteristic of the offence that one would receive stolen property usually for financial gain. No other particular aggravating factors were drawn to my attention. It could be said that strictly speaking the offences were “committed in company” but the very character of the offending of being an accessory after the fact or receiving stolen property is to be having an association with a principal offender either as the receiver of stolen goods or as an accessory after the fact in the principal offence.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors I have concluded that the offences were not part of planned or organised criminal activity. I am satisfied by reference to the progress the prisoner has made by the rehabilitation program at Guthrie House and the assessments made of her by the psychologist and the Probation and Parole Service that she has good prospects of rehabilitation. I accept as a mitigating factor in relation to each offence that the prisoner has shown remorse in that she has accepted responsibility for her actions and acknowledged the loss and damage that has been caused, although she obviously has little or no capacity to make reparation.
	
	
	With regard to accepting responsibility for her actions, I include as relevant to that her confession to the police and the statements of contrition made in the course of that interview. I take into account as a mitigating factor of course her plea of guilty that she receives a discount for that as I have earlier indicated and also her assistance to law enforcement authorities, but that is also taken into account by a discrete discount. Ultimately the total discount she should receive upon the otherwise appropriate sentences will be thirty-five per cent being a combination of the discounts that I have foreshadowed and as I have said with regard to the discount for cooperation calculated at ten per cent I am prepared to ascribe to her five per cent for the future cooperation. I appreciate of course she may never be required to give evidence but the fact that she is willing to give evidence may ultimately be a contributing matter to the decision of the principal to plead guilty, if in fact that is what he does. If he does not plead guilty then she will be required to give evidence.
	
	
	One last matter by reference to the material that was tendered on behalf of the prisoner I referred to the psychologist who had been counselling her whilst at Guthrie House. She has seen the prisoner on seven occasions and has noted particularly marked anxiety symptoms in her presentation and detailed psychological treatment and counselling to address those matters. Further, I note the report from the Department of Health’s clinical psychologist from the drug and alcohol team at Caringbah which details arrangements made for counselling for the prisoner whilst living at Caringbah. Ultimately, the submission of the accused was that I should impose a term of imprisonment that ought be suspended, assuming that the terms of imprisonment permitted suspension. The Crown’s position was that whilst a term of full time custody could be appropriate, the Court could consider a term of imprisonment in relation to each offence that might permit the making of an intensive correction order. The view I have taken of the matter is this, that the rehabilitation of the prisoner will be better served by a suspension of the term of imprisonment permitting supervision by the Probation and Parole Service.
	
	
	Secondly, and equally important in my mind, is that there is a course in place of after rehabilitation care, which to my mind will substitute for the demands that ordinarily would be placed upon the prisoner by the conditions of an Intensive Correction Order. I am mindful of the fact that an Intensive Correction Order will closely monitor the prisoner in a range of ways and the prisoner would be subject to the direction of the Parole Authority. But given the detail of the reports from Guthrie House it seems to me with respect that the aftercare program therein set out will in material ways serve many of the same purposes that can be served by the programs dictated in an intensive correction order. Thus having obviously taken into account all the matters that have been raised by the parties and the evidence from their submissions I make the following orders.
	
	
	Ma’am could you just stand up for a moment. In relation of the offence of accessory after the fact to armed robbery or robbery with an offensive weapon, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year and eight months. That term of imprisonment is suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and I order that the execution of the sentence be suspended for the term of the sentence. I order that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence upon the following conditions. Firstly, you are to appear before court if called to do so at any time. Secondly, you are to be of good behaviour. Thirdly, you are to advise the registrar of the Criminal Listing Directorate of the District Court at Sydney of any change of residential address. Fourthly, you are to accept the supervision and guidance of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service, particularly at Miranda throughout the period of this good behaviour bond and obey the reasonable directions of the officers of the service, particularly directions given to you in relation to drug and medical treatment and counselling and psychological counselling. Fifthly, to enable such supervision and guidance to commence, you are to report to the office of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service at Miranda within seven days of today.
	
	
	Do you understand those conditions?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes your Honour,
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You have got to report within seven days of today and obey all reasonable directions of the officers of the service which may include regular urine analysis and completing the after care program of Guthrie House.
	
	
	Do you understand that?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: On that basis you won’t be required to go upstairs to enter into that bond, the bond will be forwarded to you by the office. You can leave the dock.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You can come out of the dock now and you can take a seat behind your counsel.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of receiving you are convicted, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twelve months, that term of imprisonment is suspended pursuant to the terms of s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and I order that the execution of the sentence be suspended for the term of the sentence. The conditions of the execution of the sentence is that you enter into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence. The conditions of that good behaviour bond will be as for the conditions that were fixed in relation to the earlier bond that I granted you.
	
	
	You can take a seat thank you.
	
	
	Madam Crown is there anything else?
	
	
	MILLWARD: Nothing else your Honour no.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Anything else ma’am?
	
	
	JOHNSON: No your Honour.

		13 April 2015",2013-03-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761106,R v Tuki (No. 3) [2013] NSWSC 203,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: On 23 November 2012, I conducted a fitness inquiry with respect to the Accused, Ray Tuki, following which I found that he was unfit to be tried for a number of serious offences charged against him in this Court, including murder: R v Tuki [2012] NSWSC 1436. 

2It may be taken that the contents of that judgment, which set out the charges against Mr Tuki, the evidence before the Court on that inquiry and a statement of applicable legal principles, are incorporated by reference in the present judgment. 

3Following the finding of unfitness, Mr Tuki was referred to The Mental Health Review Tribunal (""MHRT"") as required by the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. 

4On 28 February 2013, the Honourable Harold Sperling QC, Deputy President of the MHRT, wrote to the Court providing a copy of the MHRT's reasons and determination concerning Mr Tuki. 

5As my judgment of 23 November 2012 and the reasons of the MHRT make clear, Mr Tuki had been found unfit to be tried with respect to two sets of charges, one set in the District Court and the other group being the present charges in this Court. 

6The MHRT conducted a hearing on 17 January 2013. The MHRT was constituted by the Honourable Harold Sperling QC as Deputy President, Dr Michael Giuffrida, psychiatrist, and Ms Meredith Martin. The MHRT had a volume of documentary evidence before it and, in addition, heard evidence from a number of persons who were involved in the treatment and care of Mr Tuki. The reasons of the MHRT, which are in evidence before me on this inquiry, will speak for themselves. 

7It is sufficient to observe that Dr Matthew Hearps, consultant psychiatrist, was asked to give an opinion to the MHRT concerning the fitness of Mr Tuki to be tried, by reference to the test in R v Presser (1958) VR 45. Dr Hearps answered affirmatively concerning the application of the Presser test to Mr Tuki, and concluded that he was fit to be tried on both the District Court and the Supreme Court matters (pages 7, 9, MHRT reasons).

8The MHRT, which included an expert psychiatrist member, found on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Tuki was fit to stand trial (page 6, MHRT reasons). Accordingly, in the documents dated 28 February 2013, the MHRT informed the Court that Mr Tuki was now fit to be tried for the offences charged in this Court. 

9Having been notified of this finding, the Court proceeded to take steps in accordance with s.29 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. Firstly, it was necessary to inquire whether the Director of Public Prosecutions was to further proceed against Mr Tuki. The Director has indicated that it is intended to proceed further against him. In those circumstances, the obligation of the Court is to hold a further inquiry as to Mr Tuki's fitness as a soon as practicable. That is what I am undertaking today. 

10I should observe that, because of the temporal coincidence of the MHRT's conclusion that Mr Tuki was fit to be tried and the listing of a trial of alleged co-offenders of Mr Tuki in this Court, I gave consideration earlier this week to the question of whether (if Mr Tuki was fit to be tried) his trial ought be joined to the trial of the three co-Accused. 

11The Crown indicated that it did not wish any deferral of the trial in circumstances where any delay was likely to be at a least some weeks. The Crown was ready to proceed with that trial, as were the counsel for the three accused in that trial. 

12My reasons for determining that this fitness inquiry should proceed promptly, but separately from the scheduled trial, are contained in a judgment of 11 March 2013: R v Tuki (No. 2) [2013] NSWSC 196.

13In addition to the reasons of the MHRT with respect to Mr Tuki, further evidence has been placed before the Court in the form of a report of Dr Adam Martin, forensic psychiatrist, dated 13 March 2013. As my judgment of 23 November 2012 makes clear, Dr Martin examined Mr Tuki on a number of occasions on behalf of Mr Tuki's legal representatives, and he had expressed the opinion that Mr Tuki was unfit to be tried. 

14Dr Martin examined Mr Tuki again on 13 March 2013. Dr Martin had available to him the reasons of the MHRT dated 28 February 2013. 

15It is Dr Martin's opinion, having applied the Presser test, that Mr Tuki's mental state:

""... is much improved, he appears to understand the charges, he knows of different pleas and basically what they mean, knows the basic functions of the court, is able to express his wishes coherently, able to discuss issues with his legal team, and probably able to challenge evidence or members of the jury.""

16Dr Martin concluded, ""I think he is likely to be found fit to stand trial"".

17Having regard to the evidence, a finding should be made, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Tuki is fit to be tried for these matters. In making this finding, I have applied the principles as summarised in R v Tuki at [4]-[13].

18I am satisfied that Mr Tuki is fit to be tried for the offences with which he is charged before this Court. 

19The effect of this finding is that, under s.30 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, the proceedings brought against Mr Tuki in respect to the offences are to recommence or continue in accordance with the appropriate criminal procedures. In this case, the proceedings are to continue (the proceedings having been held in abeyance pending determination of the question of whether Mr Tuki was fit to be tried). 

20I adjourn the criminal proceedings against Mr Tuki to the Arraignments List on 5 April 2013. Bail is refused.

		04 October 2013",2013-03-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761113,R v Nguyen [2013] NSWSC 197,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1HER HONOUR:  Upon his re-arraignment on 19 July 2012 the offender entered a plea of guilty to the manslaughter of William Crews on 8 September 2010 contrary to s 18(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 and a further count of wounding Mr Crews with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm on the same date contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act (""the wounding offence"").  At the time of his death William Crews was a serving member of the New South Wales Police Service holding the rank of Constable.  He was aged 26.
2Manslaughter attracts a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment.  The wounding offence also attracts a maximum of 25 years imprisonment to which a standard non-parole period of 7 years applies. 
3The Crown accepted the pleas of guilty in satisfaction of a range of charges, including shooting at Constable Crews with intent to murder contrary to s 29 of the Crimes Act, upon which the offender was committed to stand trial in December 2011 and upon which he was arraigned in March 2012 when the matter was listed for trial.
4On his re-arraignment it was also agreed that two of the offences upon which he was committed for trial would be included on a Form 1 to be taken into account on the sentence for the manslaughter charge in accordance with the procedure in s 33(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  Those offences were the unauthorised possession of a prohibited firearm, contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996, and possession of 3.21 grams of methylamphetamine for the purposes of supply, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  The firearm the subject of the possession charge was used by the offender in committing the offences to which he pleaded guilty.  Although the drug offence was included on the Form 1, for reasons which I will detail later, I do not propose to take it into account in imposing sentence. 
5On 9 October 2012 the offender applied to reverse his pleas of guilty.  That application was refused.
6He appeared before me for sentence on 1 and 8 March 2013. 
7In light of the fact that the pleas of guilty were entered after the matter had been fixed for trial I propose to allow a discount of 10 per cent on the sentence to be imposed on each count.  The reason for the timing of the pleas is irrelevant to an assessment of their utilitarian value as is the fact that the offender applied unsuccessfully to reverse the pleas of guilty. 
8The basis upon which the pleas of guilty were accepted by the Crown as reflecting the offender's culpability for both the death and wounding of Constable Crews was incorporated in an agreed statement of facts. 
The facts for sentencing purposes
9In September 2010 the offender lived at a unit complex at Bankstown.  He also had use of a garage numbered 8 in the basement car park to the complex.
10On 8 September 2010 Detective Senior Constable Roberts, attached to the Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad, received information from a registered source as a consequence of which a search warrant was applied for in relation to the offender's residential unit and Garage 8.  The warrant was issued later that day.  Detective Senior Constable Roberts was the officer-in-charge of the execution of the warrant.  Prior to the deployment of the police officers who were to assist in the execution of the warrant, Detective Senior Constable Roberts conducted a briefing which was attended by those officers, including Constable Crews.  
11Of the eight police officers deployed to execute the warrant, three were in police uniform.  The remaining officers, including Constable Crews and Detective Senior Constable Roberts, were in civilian clothes.  Some or all of the officers were armed with police issue weapons.  Constable Crews was armed, as was Detective Senior Constable Roberts.  The operation was, however, deemed to be of low risk.  It was not anticipated that there would be firearms in the offender's premises or at his disposal.
12Police arrived at the unit complex and effected entry at approximately 9pm.  Access was obtained with the assistance of a resident who directed police to Garage 8.  The basement area was accessed through a closed door from inside the unit complex.  
13Detective Senior Constable Roberts led the officers into the basement followed by Constable Crews.  Detective Senior Constable Roberts was carrying a battering ram in the event that it was necessary to force entry to the garage.  Constable Crews was carrying a folder containing the warrant and related documents.  Another police officer gave directions to Garage 1 in the mistaken belief it was Garage 8. 
14Earlier that day the offender was party to discussions in the garage area of the unit complex about a drug deal in which Tan Chung, an associate of the offender, was involved with three other men.  These men also discussed an existing drug debt where Chung owed money to one of the men after that man had supplied him with drugs the previous day.  The men left the garage shortly before police arrived.  The offender and Chung remained.  They were inside Garage 1, the door to which was open when police arrived.  Three other men were inside Garage 8 behind a closed mesh door.  
15Constable Crews and Detective Senior Constable Roberts walked towards Garage 1, mistakenly believing it was Garage 8.  Other officers, also in civilian clothes, were close behind.  Uniformed police were further behind, including the officer tasked with recording the execution of the search warrant.  No officer had a firearm drawn.  Police (including Constable Crews) signalled their approach to Garage 1 by announcing they were police a number of times. 
16Detective Senior Constable Roberts then heard Constable Crews, who was the only police officer in front of him, yell out, ""Gun, he has a gun"".  He then saw the offender walking out of Garage 1 in a crouched position holding a pistol which he was pointing in various directions, including in the direction of police.  The offender then started moving towards the police.  Police were unaware that Chung was hiding in Garage 1 or that there were other men in Garage 8.  
17Constable Crews and Detective Senior Constable Roberts again identified themselves as police and directed the offender to put down the gun. 
18What followed was a sequence of five shots fired from three guns in the space of seconds.  First, the offender discharged his pistol (later confirmed to be a Bryco Arms pistol loaded with .22 gauge ammunition) at Constable Crews which penetrated the soft tissue of his left upper arm.  Constable Crews then discharged three shots in quick succession - effectively in the process of drawing his weapon after he had been shot by the offender.  Ballistics later confirmed the shots fired by Constable Crews were discharged in random angulations to the ground.  Detective Senior Constable Roberts, who had retreated with other police rearwards behind a side wall, then drew his weapon which he discharged at the offender.  Ballistics later confirmed that the single shot from his weapon struck Constable Crews in the neck.  This was a fatal wound.  Detective Senior Constable Roberts told investigating police that the shot was not a carefully aimed shot, however, at the time he believed that his firearm was pointed at the offender who he was attempting to hit.  All three weapons were later confirmed to be in working order. 
19Immediately after Detective Senior Constable Roberts fired the shot he saw Constable Crews on the ground bleeding from the head.  Constable Crews was later transferred to hospital by ambulance.  Death was pronounced at 12.15am the following morning.
20While Detective Senior Constable Roberts' attention was focused on the welfare of Constable Crews as he was lying prone in the open garage area, the other police officers maintained their position behind cover in the garage.  Detective Senior Constable Roberts then saw the offender trying to use his firearm which appeared to be jammed, after which he picked up the battering ram from where it had been dropped and simulated its use as a gun by pointing it towards the officers, including Detective Senior Constable Roberts.
21The offender (and Chung) then retreated into the garage and eventually made their way to the offender's unit via a rear door.  Police were not aware that the offender had left the basement and, believing he was still in the garage, made attempts to encourage him to surrender his firearm and present himself.  When it was ultimately established that the offender was not in the basement, first aid was rendered to Constable Crews and the basement area was secured. 
22Both in the garage after the shots were fired, on his way to the unit and once inside the unit the offender asserted repeatedly to Chung that the men were, what he describes as, ""fake police"", and that he believed they thought he had money.  Chung said he told the offender that the men were in fact police.  The offender told his wife that someone was trying to break into the garage, and that he shot the man and he thought he was going to die.  It is unclear whether he was aware that his shot had wounded the officer in the arm and unaware that the officer was shot a second time by someone else.  Although this is an available inference it is irrelevant for sentencing purposes.  It does, however, lend support to the Crown's submission that the atmosphere in the basement was infused with considerable tension and confusion, and that the exchange of shots were fired in very quick succession with Constable Crews falling to the ground injured in the process.  
23The offender emptied the twelve bullets from the pistol and placed the magazine into the drain of the bathroom and placed the pistol on the veranda.  At some stage he barricaded himself and the other occupants of the unit inside by placing furniture against the door.  Police negotiators contacted him and negotiated his surrender.  He was arrested and conveyed to Bankstown Police Station together with Chung and the other occupants of Garage 8 who were also arrested.  
24The three men inside Garage 8 told police that they were playing cards.  However, upon a search of that garage police found the following:
(i) a large white coloured plastic storage tub containing a number of empty resealable plastic bags, a brown case containing 2 small bags with white crystal inside, a number of tablets, a set of scales and a white spoon;
(ii) 3.21 grams of N,N-dimethylamphetamine in a resealable bag; and
(iii) an ashtray with a glass pipe and razor blade.
25Garage 1 was also searched where empty resealable bags, a glass pipe containing a white substance and a packet of bicarbonate of soda were located.  
26There is no evidence before me to further identify the ""white crystal"" or the two tablets in the white tub in Garage 8 or the ""white substance"" on the pipe in Garage 1.  The owners of both garages were spoken to by police and disclaimed any knowledge of the items seized.  
27The facts are silent as to the result of any charges laid against the three men in Garage 8 or Chung consequent upon their arrest, or any connection between the three men in the garage and the offender.  The 3.21 grams of methylamphetamine found in that garage is however the subject of the supply count included on the Form 1.  In the course of sentencing submissions I was informed by Mr Ledinh, the offender's solicitor, that he was instructed that Chung had brought that drug to the garage for shared personal use and that they were in joint possession of the drug for that reason.  This account is in direct conflict with the signed Form 1 where the offender admitted to having the same drugs in his possession for supply, an offence he had at one time invited me to take into account when imposing sentence on the manslaughter count.  The Crown elected not to call any evidence to meet his claim that he had the drugs for personal use and not for supply.  In the result, in the exercise of the discretion afforded me under s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I do not propose to take the supply charge into account as one of the two offences on the Form 1.  It will be a matter for the prosecuting authorities as to whether the offence is to be prosecuted as a supply in other proceedings. 
28I do note that the results of blood and urine testing of the offender after his arrest confirmed relatively minor concentrations of morphine, amphetamine and methylamphetamine which, in light of what the expert pharmacologist was asked to assume was the offender's habitual use of drugs, would not have had any relevant impact on his perception at the time of the shooting incident. 
29The offender agreed to participate in a recorded interview after his arrest in the course of which he said that he and Chung went to the garage that evening to smoke some heroin.  The offender said that at the time of the incident Chung was organising a drug deal involving eight ounces of cocaine.  In the agreed facts it is said that the offender falsely claimed to police that he was not involved in the transaction from which I infer that the offender accepts that he was in fact involved.  The extent of his involvement was not the subject of any further elaboration.  
30In the interview the offender told police that whilst he was inside the garage he heard a lot of people shouting and screaming and saw two men standing at the entrance to the front of the garage who he believed were there to rob him.  Police later confirmed by enquiries independent of the offender and his family that approximately two weeks prior to the shooting he was the victim of an attempted robbery by two masked men armed with bats whilst he was in Garage 8.  On that occasion the offender shouted at the men (apparently to ward them off) and they fled, leaving behind a mobile phone which police located during the search of the premises on 8 September 2010 and were able to trace.  The offender reported to his wife that the robbers had cricket bats.  He told police the robbers had knives.  It is not in dispute that the offender obtained the pistol after this incident to protect himself in the event of another robbery.  There is no evidence as to whether the robbers were looking for drugs or money or both. 
31Although the offender also agreed that he was aware from a previous search warrant executed on his premises that police officers engaged in operations of that kind do not always wear police uniform, there is no evidence as to the circumstances in which the earlier warrant was applied for and executed, or when that occurred relative to the shooting.  
The basis upon which the plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted  
32For the purposes of the sentence proceedings it was the agreed position that the plea of guilty to manslaughter involves the offender accepting that he caused the death of Constable Crews despite the single shot he fired penetrating Constable Crews' upper arm and the fatal shot being fired by another police officer.   
33The issue of causation was conceded by his acceptance of the proposition that the discharge of the pistol (which caused the wound the subject of the wounding charge) substantially contributed to the exchange of gunfire in the course of which Constable Crews was fatally shot by a fellow officer, and in circumstances where it was reasonably foreseeable that someone in the vicinity of an exchange of gun fire may be fatally (even if inadvertently) shot.  
34The plea of guilty to manslaughter also entails the Crown accepting the reasonable possibility that the offender genuinely believed that it was necessary to shoot at the person who proved to be Constable Crews in order to defend himself (based as it was on his mistaken belief that the officer was someone who was intent on robbing him and someone who might have posed a serious risk to his safety).  It also entails acceptance by the offender that a reasonable person in his position would not have considered that it was necessary to shoot that person in defence of himself or his property. 
35The plea of guilty to the charge of wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm entails acceptance of the fact that the offender shot at Constable Crews intending to cause him grievous bodily harm and that he wounded him in the process.  Given the offender's concession that his response to the presence of men he believed might rob or harm him was not reasonable, self-defence was not available as a defence to that charge. 
Objective seriousness
36As assessment of the objective seriousness of both offences is an essential part of the sentencing exercise.  That assessment is undertaken referable to the nature of the offending (taking into account any relevant statutory aggravating or mitigating factors) and not circumstances personal to the offender.  In this case, because of the basis upon which the pleas of guilty have been accepted, there is a need to carefully isolate and characterise the facts critical to an assessment of the objective seriousness of both offences.  
37Objective seriousness is also to be assessed according to the established principles of sentencing, including the fact that an offender is not to be punished for any conduct that is not the subject of a discrete charge, even where the agreed facts might reveal other criminal offending - even admitted criminal offending - as they do in this case.  The Crown submissions on the issue of objective seriousness, which are relied upon in part to support the ultimate submission that both offences are in the worst category, overlooked that fundamental principle in a number of critical respects.
38The Crown relied upon historical facts which are said to reflect the offender's profile as a drug dealer (including his implied admission that he was involved in Chung's negotiating a drug deal on the day of the shooting) to ground the further finding that he armed himself after the attempted robbery to facilitate his drug dealing activities.  It was submitted that the seriousness of his offending should be assessed against these facts.  Quite apart from whether this submission is open having regard to the principles in R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383; 5 A Crim R 329, it is without the necessary evidential support in the agreed statement of facts.  
39The first matter upon which the Crown relied in advancing that submission involved the fact that a warrant was executed on the offender's premises at some earlier date, which the Crown submitted, both in writing and orally, was in the course of a ""drug raid"" because it was suspected that the offender was ""engaged in drug dealing"".  There was no direct evidence of either of these related facts or any facts upon which I could draw that inference beyond reasonable doubt.  As I have already noted, aside from the offender accepting when interviewed by police after his arrest that he was aware from the execution of the earlier warrant that police do not always wear uniforms, there was nothing in the agreed facts as to the circumstances in which that warrant issued, or when, or whether any items of any kind were seized under the warrant.  
40The further matter relied upon by the Crown as bearing upon objective seriousness focused on the offender's response to the earlier attempted robbery.  The Crown submitted that by arming himself with a pistol to protect himself and his property from those who might want to steal from him, he signified his resolve to continue to deal in drugs instead of taking the opportunity to desist from drug dealing.  The Crown also submitted that the time during which he maintained this stance aggravated the objective seriousness of the offences that involved the use of the pistol on 8 September 2010.  Again, the Crown's submission founders on the failure to establish that the earlier attempted robbery was in fact drug related.  There was nothing in the facts to indicate whether the robbers were looking for money or drugs or both, and nothing to indicate whether the offender was dealing in drugs at that time.  While he may have been dealing drugs and motivated to arm himself with a pistol to facilitate his drug dealing, the agreed facts do not permit the conclusion to be drawn that he was in fact dealing drugs to the necessary criminal standard.  Self evidently, the fact that the offender supplied drugs in May 2005, as reflected in his criminal record, is an insufficient basis upon which to conclude he was in fact dealing drugs at the time of the robbery in 2010.  On the other hand, the agreed facts do permit me to find that the offender was involved, in some unspecified way, in Chung's negotiation of a drug deal, either at the time of the shooting or some short time before.  It is not clear whether the men in Garage 8 were party to those negotiations.  No cocaine or money was located.
41In summary, what the agreed facts do establish as proved facts for sentencing purposes is that the offender reacted to the attempted robbery by arming himself with a loaded pistol with which to defend himself should he be confronted by robbers again.  Some time later, soon after he had involved himself with others who were negotiating a drug deal, he armed himself because he believed he was going to be robbed or physically harmed, and in the process he fired the pistol at an unarmed man who was approaching him in the basement without taking any steps to ascertain whether that man (or anyone with him) in fact posed any danger to him, or whether the claim by those men that they were police officers was legitimate.  In the result, his actions wounded Constable Crews and caused his death. 
42The Crown acknowledges that the offender is not to be sentenced for his possession of the pistol either on the day of the shooting or for a period of some weeks prior to that day.  Neither does his possession of the pistol render either of the offences for which he is to be sentenced more objectively serious.  Rather, I was invited by the Crown and the offender to take the offence of possession of the pistol, the remaining offence on the Form 1, into account in imposing the sentence for manslaughter by giving greater weight both to the need for personal deterrence and to the community's entitlement to exact retribution, and in that way to increase the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate for that offence (see Attorney-General's Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002, Re [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146; 137 A Crim R 180 at [39]-[42]).
43The fact that the pistol was used in the commission of both offences is, however, a statutory aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and a factor which, in my view, should be afforded significant weight in the sentencing exercise.  Irrespective of the offender's fear of being robbed and perhaps physically harmed in the process, he had no right to arm himself with a loaded pistol and no right to shoot it with the intention of causing his target grievous bodily harm.  The risk of serious injury, or even death, entailed by that kind of conduct is obvious and will be denounced in the sentences to be imposed.  I am satisfied that taking the use of the pistol into account as an aggravating factor does not entail any breach of the prohibition against double counting in s 21A(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  The use of the pistol is not an element of either of the offences. 
44The Crown placed very considerable weight on the statutory aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(a) as reflecting the objective seriousness of both offences.  It provides as follows: The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows: 
(a)  the victim was a police officer, emergency services worker, correctional officer, judicial officer, council law enforcement officer, health worker, teacher, community worker, or other public official, exercising public or community functions and the offence arose because of the victim's occupation or voluntary work...
45That section is said to be invoked in this case because Constable Crews was wounded and killed while exercising his public duties as a police officer and that the offence(s) occurred because of his occupation as a police officer, in the sense that he was shot while approaching the offender in his capacity as a police officer executing a search warrant.  I am satisfied that each of those preconditions is met.  Subject only to the question whether, on a proper construction of the provision, it is necessary for the Crown to prove that the offender was either aware that Constable Crews was a police officer in the execution of his duties when he shot at him (or whether it is sufficient that it was reasonably foreseeable that the men approaching him might have been police officers), the statutory aggravating factor is available to be considered in the sentencing exercise.
46Because the Crown has accepted that it is reasonably possible that the offender did not know Constable Crews was a police officer, and that the plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted on that basis, if it is necessary for the Crown to prove that the offender knew (or believed) that the men were police, the Crown cannot at the same time ask that it be treated as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.   
47The Crown submitted that each of the factors in s 21A(2) describe a state of affairs, none of which are expressed to require any knowledge on the part of the offender.  As a matter of statutory construction that is so.  The Crown submitted that it follows that it is sufficient that the objective facts in ss 21A(2)(a)-(p) are proved by evidence in the ordinary way to attract consideration in sentencing proceedings as aggravating factors and that the offender's state of knowledge or awareness is irrelevant.  The Crown submitted that were an offender to kill a police officer in an undercover operation believing the police officer to be a drug dealer who had crossed him in some way, s 21A(2)(a) would be enlivened and that the same analysis applies here.  I do not find that analogy persuasive.  It simply poses the same question in a different context.  
48The Crown referred me to R v Penisini [2004] NSWCCA 339 in support of the proposition that knowledge is not relevant, where at [20] Spigelman CJ said:The courts will, and do, give great weight to the protection of members of the police force by reason of the fact that in the course of their duties, they are called upon to place themselves in danger and do so for the benefit of the community at large. That is why the courts have always accepted that the fact that the victim was a police officer is a substantially aggravating factor...
49His Honour's observations resound with sound public policy and illustrate the connection between sentencing principles and the public interest but that case is not determinative of the question with which I am concerned since it was clear in that case that the offenders knew the victim was a police officer.  
50I am assisted, however, by a further authority the Crown expressly drew to my attention when the issue as to what an offender must know or be aware of was resolved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in connection with other statutory aggravating factors under s 21A(2).  In Josefski v R [2010] NSWCCA 41, the offender pleaded guilty to an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal and another charge of robbery in company.  On the first charge, the sentencing judge took into account as an aggravating factor the degree of emotional harm to the adult female victim who was inside the house that was broken into and the fact that the offence was committed in the presence of a child under the age of 18 years.  It was submitted on appeal that this approach was not open to the sentencing judge because it had not been proved that the accused knew either of these factors. 
51Howie J (with whom James and Davies JJ agreed) observed at [25] that nothing in s 21A has changed the common law rule that the court is only to have regard to the consequences of an offence that were intended or could reasonably have been foreseen.  However, his Honour went on to hold that because the offences were committed by breaking into a normal dwelling house, it was reasonably foreseeable that there would be children inside and that there would be substantial emotional harm suffered by any adult inside, and on that basis the features of aggravation were properly available to be considered by the sentencing judge.
52As I see it, accepting as I must that the offender might actually have believed that the police officers were robbers (indeed, even accepting that he actually held that belief), I am also entitled to find that he could equally have reasonably foreseen that men approaching him in the basement car park might not be robbers.  This conclusion is open since it appears to have been conceded by him in the statement of agreed facts that he heard the men announce that they were police but because he thought they were robbers pretending to be police, he obtained his pistol and fired it at one of them without ascertaining whether they were in fact police.
53In the result, I propose to take into account s 21A(2)(a) as an aggravating factor in the assessment of objective seriousness, not because the offender knew or believed that Constable Crews was a police officer, but because he ought reasonably to have foreseen the possibility that he might be.  Whilst the feature of aggravation put in this way is of slightly less weight than were he to have been actually aware that the man he shot at was a police officer, it does aggravate the objective seriousness of both offences to a significant degree.
54Furthermore, since s 21A(1)(c) expressly preserves the operation of the common law and the well established body of principles that have been developed by sentencing courts over time.  As Spigelman CJ observed in Penisini, it has been long recognised that police are in a class of vulnerable people by reason of the duties they perform for the community's benefit.  For that reason, irrespective of the particular operation of s 21A(2)(a), the fact that Constable Crews was killed in the execution of his duty is a matter I am entitled to have regard to as a matter relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of both offences.
55I also take into account the fact that the offences were committed without regard to public safety (s 21A(2)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act).  Quite apart from the fact that there were other people actually in the basement area when the offender shot at Constable Crews, that area was an integral part of the unit block to which residents and their guests had a right of access.
56I note the offender's prior conviction in 2006 for the supply of a commercial quantity of prohibited drugs and the sentence of 3 years imprisonment imposed at that time.  The fact that he has a prior record for drug dealing does not aggravate the offending for which he is to be sentenced, in the sense of increasing the objective seriousness of either offence.  It does however inform where, within the boundary set by the objective circumstances of each offence, the sentences should ultimately lie.  In this case, they must provide for a measure of specific deterrence given that the shooting occurred in the context of the offender involving himself in a drug milieu where negotiations were in progress for a commercial drug supply, even if the extent of his involvement is not known.  His prior record also deprives him of the mitigating potential of a finding of good character.
57In conclusion, I accept that the offender was unaware that Constable Crews was a police officer when he shot him and that, although he did not fire the shot that killed Constable Crews, he caused his death.  I also accept that when he discharged the pistol that caused his death and the wounding he had a genuine belief (entirely misplaced) that he needed to defend himself against a perceived threat of harm.  Notwithstanding those findings, the circumstances in which the offences were committed, including the aggravating factors to which I have referred, render both offences objectively serious.  I am not persuaded, however, that either offence is in the worst category.  It would have been otherwise were the offender to have shot at Constable Crews intending to inflict grievous bodily harm knowing or believing he was a police officer, or were he with that same state of awareness to have pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis that Constable Crews was killed by his unlawful and dangerous act in shooting at him.
58To the extent that it is necessary to appoint the wounding charge within a range of offending because of the standard non-parole period that attaches to that offence, I am satisfied that it falls within the mid range of offending.  Although the offender did not rely in submissions upon his mistaken belief that the police were robbers to ameliorate the seriousness of the wounding charge, it seems to me that some allowance should be made in the assessment of objective seriousness for that offence for the Crown's concession that his belief that the men were robbers was genuine (or that the Crown could not prove that it was not).  Neither evidence nor submissions were directed to the nature of the wound and the extent of medical attention that would have been necessary to treat it.  However, viewed from the limited perspective of the wound being to the inner aspect of Constable Crews' arm and measuring two millimetres in diameter, I am unable to conclude that the wound was serious.  What justifies a finding of mid range offending is that a gun was used accompanied by an intention of causing grievous bodily harm, aggravated by the statutory factors to which I have referred.
The offender's subjective circumstances
59The offender was interviewed by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service on 1 March 2013 and provided the following information.
60He was born in Vietnam in 1955 and is one of thirteen children.  He was aged 55 at the time of the shooting.  He was educated to the equivalent level of the Higher School Certificate and spent about three years as a conscript in the army from the age of 17.  He left Vietnam in 1977.  After spending six months in a refugee camp he arrived in Australia in 1978.  He worked as a factory process worker and in clothing manufacturing to provide financially for his family who remained in Vietnam.  His parents and some family members have since migrated to Australia.  He has had no contact with his parents or his siblings since his remand.
61He was married in 1982 and has three children aged between 15 and 26.  He was divorced in 1996.  In March 2001, following his wife's death, he moved to Sydney to assume the full-time care of his children. His daughter described him as a decent father but when he began using drugs to cope with his wife's death his relationship with his children broke down.  His daughter has recently resumed contact with him but his other two children have had no contact with him for at least three years.
62He married again in 2001.  His second wife migrated to Australia from Vietnam in 2003.  They have separated since his remand.
63He commenced using heroin and crystal methamphetamine following the death of his former wife.  His drug use escalated to daily use.  He was directed to address his drug use during periods of supervision with the Probation and Parole Service after his release to parole in January 2008 but failed to do so.  At the time of the shooting, the offender reported that he was using approximately half a gram of crystal methamphetamine and a ""small amount"" of heroin per week.  He reported that he does not believe his drug use is problematic.  Given his resistance to submit to supervision on his release to parole, his lack of insight into his drug use and his apparent determination to continue to involve himself in some way in a drug milieu, I am unable to find that he has favourable prospects of rehabilitation. 
64Although the offender suffered a stroke in November 2012 there is nothing to indicate that his time in custody will be more onerous for that reason, or because of his age.  He is currently taking prescribed medication. 
Remorse 
65The offender acknowledged the seriousness of the offences and accepted responsibility for the death of Constable Crews.  He also acknowledged the impact of his conduct on the officer's family and the community.  He gave evidence on sentence where he expressed his remorse which I accept as genuine.  He extended his apologies to the family and to the police force.  Although his expressions of remorse are delivered late, this is likely because of the understandable difficulties he has faced in accepting his legal liability for the death of Constable Crews.  I propose to take his remorse into account in his favour on sentence although its weight as a mitigating factor is, to a large extent, overwhelmed by the collective weight of the aggravating features to which I have referred.  
Special circumstances 
66Mr Ledinh submitted that I should find special circumstances on the basis of the offender's age and what he submitted were his good prospects of rehabilitation.  Having regard to my findings and the absence of any sufficiently special circumstances, I decline to do so. 
Accumulation or concurrency 
67The Crown submitted that in the unusual circumstances of this case the sentences to be imposed on the individual counts should be partially accumulated.  It is well established that questions of concurrency or accumulation are discretionary, subject to the application of principles of totality.  That principled approach requires the imposition of an appropriate sentence in respect of each offence before consideration is given to whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other.  If it can, then an order for concurrency is usually made.  If not then the sentences should be accumulated (in whole or in part) in order to reflect the overall criminality.  There is, however, no general or inflexible rule that dictates the sentencing outcome. 
68In this case the Crown submitted that despite the fact that the one causative act is common to both offences (namely the offender firing a single shot from the pistol), and that both offences were committed in the course of a single episode of the same criminal conduct, in consequence of which Constable Crews was wounded twice (one wound being fatal), the markedly different consequences of that conduct (namely a death and a wounding) warrants a partial accumulation of the sentences.  The Crown referred me to Iskov v R [2011] NSWCCA 241 as authority for the proposition that partial accumulation is appropriate even where manslaughter is charged with related offences.  In that case the Court had occasion to review partially accumulated sentences imposed at first instance for three offences where the victim was the estranged wife of the offender.  One of the offences was manslaughter by criminal negligence and the remaining two offences were offences of violence, the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm and aggravated kidnapping.  Despite the offences being committed against the same victim in the space of a few hours, which of itself warranted a considerable degree of concurrency, the sentencing judge considered it appropriate to partially accumulate the sentences because the list of injuries inflicted in the course of the malicious infliction of serious harm were not comprehended in either of the other two offences.  The same applied to the kidnapping.  The fact that the victim's death resulted from the offender's failure to drive safely whilst she was a prisoner in the car was also not comprehended by the offender's other criminal contact.  That case is readily distinguishable from this case.
69After having given careful consideration to the principled approach in the authorities, I do not propose to order that the sentences be partially accumulated.  I have come to that conclusion for the following reason.  For sentencing purposes, I am invited to accept that the offender caused the death of the Constable Crews when the shot fired by Detective Senior Constable Roberts penetrated his neck and that, literally seconds before, the offender had inflicted a gunshot wound.  Although the consequences of the offender's criminal act are different (in that the bullet he fired caused a wounding while the bullet he caused to be fired caused a death), the same criminal conduct is common to both offences.  Detective Senior Constable Roberts has no criminal liability for firing the fatal shot.  In these circumstances I am satisfied that the total criminality constituted by his offending can be comprehended by the sentence for the manslaughter, which I accept is the more serious offence by reason of the loss of life.  
70Although there are numerous cases where excessive self-defence manslaughter has attracted sentences of imprisonment (with no less than five cases in the last 18 months) those cases, and the many that have preceded them, do nothing more than establish a range of sentences referable to the maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.  There is no hierarchy of seriousness in cases of involuntary manslaughter; each sentence is imposed in recognition of the fact that where a life has been feloniously taken the offending must be denounced by a sentence that is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.  The wide range of sentences imposed where a person has killed in the genuine belief of a need to act defensively, are typical of the width of the range of sentences within any category of manslaughter.  The degree of variation in the objective facts in the reported cases, the variety of weapons and mechanisms employed from which death resulted and the interplay of necessarily different subjective circumstances has meant that neither of the cases to which I was referred by the Crown or the sentencing statistics are of any guidance.  The unusual, even unique, factual circumstances in this case, have presented me with a challenging sentencing exercise.
Victim impact statements
71Before I impose sentence it is important that I pause and acknowledge the central part Constable William Crews played in the life of each of his family members, in understandably different ways, as a son, brother and uncle, and I venture to observe as a friend and mentor.  As his family is aware, I have not received their statements for the purpose of increasing the sentence to be imposed on this offender but to allow them the opportunity to participate in the sentence proceedings by publicly expressing their grief and making me aware of its ongoing impact on each of their lives.  I accept without qualification that they feel their loss on a daily basis, and that there has been no lessening of their grief over the years since Constable Crews' death.  I take this opportunity to extend my personal sympathies to them.
Sentence
72Taking into account the purposes for which sentence is imposed as reflected in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I impose the following sentences:
Philip Nguyen, on the charge of manslaughter, after taking into account the offence on the Form 1 and after allowing a discount for the plea of guilty, I impose a term of imprisonment of 9 years and 6 months, comprised of a non-parole period of 7 years and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months.  
On the charge of wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, and after having regard to the standard non-parole period of 7 years which operates as a guidepost to sentence in the way provided for in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, and after allowing a discount for the plea of guilty, I impose a term of imprisonment of 6 years and 3 months, comprised of a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months.  
I direct that the sentences for each offence be backdated to commence on 8 September 2010.  Accordingly, you will be first eligible for release to parole on 7 September 2017.**********

2761125,HUDD v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 57,"JUDGMENT

1HOEBEN JA:
Background
Pursuant to s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the appellant seeks leave to appeal against his conviction for murder and against a sentence imposed by Newman AJ at Sydney on 22 February 2005.

2The appellant and Scott Brown were jointly tried in the Supreme Court before Newman AJ and a jury on an indictment containing the following counts:

Count 1: That they on 24 December 2002 at Matraville in the State of New South Wales did murder James Rawas.

Count 2: That they on 24 December 2002 at Matraville in the State of New South Wales did, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a revolver, rob James Rawas of cash, a mobile phone and a notebook.

Count 3: That they on 24 December 2002 at Matraville in the State of New South Wales did, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a revolver, rob Pedro Haedo of cash, a mobile phone and a notebook.

Count 4: That they on 24 December 2002 at Matraville in the State of New South Wales did maliciously wound Kevin Hines with intent to do grievous bodily harm.

Count 5: That they on 24 December 2002 at Matraville in the State of New South Wales, being in company with each other, did assault Pedro Haedo thereby occasioning to him actual bodily harm.

3The trial commenced on 2 November 2004 and on 9 December 2004 the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of each charge against both the appellant and Mr Brown.

4The appellant was sentenced as follows:

Count 5: A head sentence of 2 years commencing 24 December 2002 and expiring 23 December 2004 with a non-parole period of 18 months expiring 23 June 2004.

Count 4: A head sentence of 5 years commencing 24 December 2002 and expiring on 23 December 2007 with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months expiring 23 September 2006.

Count 3: A head sentence of 10 years commencing 24 December 2002 and expiring on 23 December 2012 with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months expiring 23 June 2010.

Count 2: A head sentence of 10 years commencing 24 December 2002 and expiring on 23 December 2012 with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months expiring 23 June 2010.

Count 1: A head sentence of 27 years commencing 23 June 2004 and expiring 22 June 2031 with a non-parole period of 20 years and 3 months expiring 22 September 2024.

5The appellant was therefore sentenced to imprisonment with a total head sentence of 28 ½ years commencing 24 December 2002 and expiring 22 June 2031 with a total non-parole period of 21 years and 9 months expiring on 22 September 2024.

6The Crown case was one of felony murder. The Crown alleged that the appellant and Scott Brown entered into a criminal enterprise to commit an armed robbery on the Retravision store situated in Bunnerong Road, Matraville. 

7The Crown alleged that shortly after the store was opened to the public, the appellant and Mr Brown entered. The appellant was observed to walk to the rear office holding a pistol in front of him. Three employees, Messrs Rawas, Haedo and Hines, were ordered to lie on the floor. The appellant and Mr Brown were unsuccessful in their attempts to obtain the keys to the safe and proceeded to search bags belonging to the employees, finding and taking in excess of $2000, a mobile phone and a notebook. The appellant fired his pistol into a box in the office.

8Both offenders then left the office, leaving the three employees bound by electrical cable ties. Mr Rawas soon managed to extricate himself from the cable ties, retrieved a machete from a specific place in the store and gave chase to the appellant and Mr Brown.

9Outside the front entry to a delicatessen shop, approximately 20 metres from the Retravision store, Mr Rawas caught up with the appellant. A struggle ensued with Mr Rawas holding the machete to the appellant's throat at one point in time. The appellant managed to swing around and extricate himself from Mr Rawas, reached into a bag which he was carrying, retrieved his pistol and shot Mr Rawas in the stomach. A second shot was fired shortly thereafter and is thought to have lodged in the roof of the shop.

10After the shooting the appellant was set upon by persons who saw the event, including the other two employees from the Retravision store and was held by them until the police arrived. In the course of the struggle with those persons, the appellant was disarmed. Mr Rawas was rushed to hospital, but died some hours later.

11It was the appellant's case at trial that he was an innocent bystander on the footpath near the delicatessen and was there run into by a man fleeing from the Retravision shop who had a pistol. The appellant said that he became embroiled in a struggle with this man. During the struggle, the man let go of the pistol, and made good his escape, leaving the appellant with a pistol at which point he was restrained by others who came to assist the shop owner. 

12The appellant relied upon the following Grounds of Appeal:

CONVICTION
Ground 1 - The learned trial judge erred in declining the application made by the appellant at his trial that there was ""no case"" on the charge of murder, based on the principle of ""felony murder"".

Ground 2 - The learned trial judge erred in his directions to the jury on the issue of the appellant's liability to be convicted of murder on the basis of felony murder.

Ground 3 - The verdict of the jury on the charge of murder is unreasonable, having regard to the evidence on that charge: s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

13The appellant also wished to argue the following Grounds of Appeal himself:

Ground 1 - His Honour erred in admitting that portion of the evidence of Messrs Kerr and Cole insofar as it relates to their stated observations of:

(a) The appellant shooting the victim;
(b) The appellant holding a gun prior to the shooting of the victim;
(c) The appellant wrestling with the victim prior to the shooting.

Ground 2 - The Court erred in admitting evidence of the gunshot residue as evidence of the appellant having used the gun to murder the victim.

14When the appeal came on for hearing, the appellant was too ill to attend either in person or by way of audiovisual means. Senior Counsel for the appellant, while not making any submissions in support of the last two Grounds of Appeal, advised the Court that had he been well enough, it was the appellant's intention to argue those grounds in person. Since that was not possible, he invited the Court to take into account the appellant's written submissions in relation to those Grounds of Appeal. He also sought the leave of the Court to tender what was described as a ""cleaned up"" DVD which was said to be a copy of Exhibit J at trial, to which extensive reference was made by the appellant in his written submissions.

15The Court deferred ruling on the admissibility of the ""cleaned up"" DVD, until it had the opportunity to view it. Exhibit J comprised a video and DVD of approximately four minutes in length, taken from a CCTV security camera positioned outside the delicatessen.

Factual background and conduct of trial

16The Crown outlined the manner in which it sought to prove that the appellant had committed the offence of murder.

""It is the Crown case that [the appellant] and Brown murdered Mr Rawas. In the circumstances of this case, the crime of murder is committed when the act of the accused causing the death charged was done during or immediately after the commission, by the accused or some accomplice with him, of the crime of armed robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon. The Crown does not have to prove that either man intended to kill or intended to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Rawas. All the Crown does have to prove beyond reasonable doubt is the act causing death was done during or immediately after the crime of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon. As to the [appellant], it is the Crown case that during or immediately after he committed the crime of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, he shot and killed Mr Rawas with that same weapon. Now I also include the words ""during or immediately after"" the armed robbery, because an armed robbery does come to an end, and until then the robber has successfully escaped the crime. In this case, the robbers escaped on foot during or immediately after the commission by the [appellant], and at the time of the shooting of Mr Rawas, the shooting of Mr Rawas was immediately after the robbery ..."" (T.12.36 - 13.5)

17Later the Crown said:

""In order to prove that the accused are guilty of murder, the Crown must first prove beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the offence of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon as against each accused. It is a foundation crime, of the murder. The offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon is made up of elements, each of which the Crown must prove and the elements of this offence are these: 

Firstly, that an act was done with the intention to steal; and secondly, the use of a dangerous weapon to inflict force or to convey the threat of force so as to procure the submission of the victim; and thirdly, the taking of the property of the victim, or property which was in his presence, custody or control. It is stealing by the use of violence, a firearm, ladies and gentlemen, is as you would have already thought, a dangerous weapon.

So in order to prove the offence of murder you first must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was a robbery with a dangerous weapon. In this case it is alleged that Mr Rawas was fatally shot by the [appellant] during or immediately after the armed robbery with a dangerous weapon ..."" (T.14.11 - .33)

The evidence in the Crown case
The robbery and Retravision employees

Pedro HAEDO

18Mr Haedo was employed as a bookkeeper at the Retravision store. Shortly after the store opened, a man appeared in the doorway of the office holding a pistol in his right hand. He was ""an old man ... like 50 or something"". He was wearing big, dark glasses, a dark baseball cap and dark clothes. He was approximately the same height as Mr Haedo. The man had a strong Australian accent. He ordered Mr Haedo and Mr Rawas on a number of occasions to lie on the floor or he would kill them. Mr Haedo put his hands up and went down on his knees.

19He saw a second man push Mr Hines into the office and as he did so, he hit Mr Hines in the back of the head with a vacuum cleaner. When Mr Haedo moved to get up, he also was hit hard on the back of the head with the vacuum cleaner. When the two men were unsuccessful in obtaining the keys to the safe, they made the employees empty their pockets and searched Mr Haedo's bag. 

20Mr Haedo's wrists were tied at the back of his head with plastic ties. The man with the pistol said ""Don't move or I'll kill you, if anyone moves I'll kill them"". Mr Haedo heard the men running to the main door.

21Mr Haedo then heard Mr Rawas say something like ""bastards"" and he ran out of the office. Mr Haedo estimated that it took him about a minute to free his hands and then he ran out of the shop after Mr Rawas.

22Mr Haedo said that the front door to the shop was wide open and he saw Mr Rawas holding a man by the arms about 10 metres away in front of the delicatessen. He identified that man as the person who had come into the office with the pistol. ""It was the same one who went in there with the base ball cap and the glasses all - the wearing of the clothes the same and also the same gun"" (T.101.9).

23Mr Haedo observed that Mr Rawas appeared to have hold of the man with the pistol by his wrists and the pistol was pointing towards Mr Rawas on the right side of his body. Mr Rawas was holding the knife in his hand. As Mr Haedo ran closer, he could see blood on Mr Rawas' shirt, near where the gun was pointing. Mr Rawas was still on his feet at the time. Mr Haedo did not hear any shots fired. Mr Haedo struggled with the man with the pistol and the three of them fell to the ground. The man with the pistol was saying ""Okay you got me"" but was still struggling and would not let go of the pistol.

24Mr Hines and a Mr Monroche-Cabon came to Mr Haedo's assistance and they also struggled with the man holding the pistol. Mr Haedo got to his feet and saw a bag near Mr Rawas which was unzipped with many plastic cable ties still inside. He also saw the baseball cap on the ground. Mr Rawas had his eyes open, but was pale. Mr Haedo took the bag and its contents back to the Retravision shop in case someone stole it. 

25Mr Haedo confirmed that the man with the pistol with whom he had struggled, was the same man who had entered the office holding a pistol at the time of the robbery. Despite being vigorously challenged in cross-examination as to this identification, he did not resile from it. He agreed that Mr Rawas must have been shot before he came out of the shop because he did not hear a shot. He confirmed the identification of the appellant under re-examination (T.157). 

Kevin HINES

26Mr Hines was the Sales Manager at the Retravision shop. He heard the front door slam and turned to see a man walking towards the office holding a pistol. Mr Hines was grabbed by a second man who struck him on the head and threw him to the floor in the office. He noted that the two men became very agitated when they could not obtain the keys to the safe.

27Mr Hines had his hands tied behind his back with some kind of nylon tie. Just as the men left the shop, Mr Hines heard a shot and heard Mr Rawas say ""bastards"". Mr Hines was not aware of Mr Rawas leaving the office and only realised he and Mr Haedo had done so when he looked around and saw that he was the only person there. He then slipped out of the ties and ran out of the shop.

28Just before exiting the shop, Mr Hines heard two gunshots. He looked up the street towards the delicatessen and saw Mr Rawas lying on the pavement. He saw Mr Monroche-Cabon and Mr Haedo wrestling with a person holding a pistol. Mr Hines grabbed the left arm of the person holding the pistol and twisted it. He could see the pistol in that person's hand and it was cocked. He could see that the gunman had his finger on the trigger. He placed his finger in a position to block the trigger because he was afraid the pistol would accidentally discharge and injure someone.

29The person with the pistol kept struggling until the pistol was forced from his hand. Thereafter, he was restrained until the police arrived. Mr Hines kept possession of the pistol.

30Mr Hines was not able to give much of a description of the person he had seen in the shop holding a pistol, other than that he was wearing fawn or light brown shoes and that the shoes were loafers or joggers. He was sure that the person he struggled with was holding the pistol in his right hand. He agreed that he might have been mistaken as to exactly where he placed his hand in trying to prevent the pistol from discharging. He said that during the struggle, the person with the pistol held it by its handle and would not let it go.

Richard MONROCHE-CABON

31Mr Monroche-Cabon was a delivery driver at Retravision. He heard a commotion in the shop at about 9am but thought that this was due to an argument between Mr Rawas and Mr Hines. About five minutes later, he was returning to the front door of the shop when he heard a bang and saw people running. He looked down Bunnerong Road and saw Mr Rawas lying on the ground about 15 metres away from the shop and Mr Haedo struggling with another person. The person he was struggling with looked pretty old and Mr Haedo was crying out ""Help, help Richard, this man shot Jim"".

32Mr Monroche-Cabon went to help and put his knee on the man's neck to pin him to the ground. He told the man to release the pistol but he would not. He saw that the pistol was in the man's right hand and when he released the pistol, Mr Hines who had subsequently arrived, kicked it away. Under cross-examination he was not sure that the man was holding the pistol in his right hand.

Bystander evidence

Peter COLE

33Mr Cole attended the delicatessen to buy morning tea. He was on the second step in the doorway when he heard raised voices. He saw two men having a scuffle. One man had a machete at the other man's throat. He recognised the man with the machete as Jim from Retravision. The men were about five-six feet away.

34Mr Cole said:

""Jim had the machete around his throat and then the other gentleman somehow spun out from his grasp and produced the gun and shot him."" (T.219.18)

35He described the man with the pistol as a grey-haired, elderly gentleman. As soon as he saw him shoot Mr Rawas, he jumped back inside the shop. He first saw the pistol about 30 seconds after the commotion started. After the man with the pistol spun around, the two men were about a metre apart facing each other. The man with the pistol had a black bag over his shoulder and he pulled the pistol out of the bag. ""He just took the gun out of the bag and just went 'boom'"". (T.220.52) The man used his right hand, which was half outstretched. Mr Cole thought that Mr Rawas had been shot twice. ""The second shot, he moved forward and he managed to grab the gentleman that had the gun and he fell towards the gutter and he fell, then the other people turned up and he was apprehended"" (T.222.34).

36Mr Cole saw that the gunman had a bag over his shoulder and he saw him pull the pistol out of the bag. He did not see what happened to the bag afterwards. He just saw cable-ties fall out of the bag which ended up on the footpath. When the man pulled the pistol out, they flew out as well. When the others intervened, the man did not let go of the pistol straight away. It took a while for him to release the pistol. The man had the pistol in his right hand and was holding it by the handle.

37Mr Cole was cross-examined by reference to Exhibit J. It was put to him that he could not possibly have observed the matters he described from where he was standing, but Mr Cole adhered to his evidence. He agreed that when giving evidence at the committal hearing, he said that Mr Rawas had jumped on the man's back and was biting and screaming at him and that as he was doing that, the elderly fellow reached into the bag, somehow spun around, turned, flung him off and just shot him from about two feet away. (T.237.24) Mr Cole said that there were about 20 seconds between the two shots.

Paul KERR

38Mr Kerr also attended the delicatessen that morning. He was standing on the front step reading the newspaper, facing out across the road when a person brushed past him running in a northerly direction. Seconds later, he saw two persons running up the road one after the other. The person in front was in his sixties, about five feet tall, Caucasian with wrap-around sunglasses. Behind him was an Italian or ethnic gentleman, early sixties, a bit taller than the first man with a stockier build and dark hair. The first male was carrying a black carry bag in front of him like a backpack. They stopped about two metres away from where he was standing.

39Mr Kerr said ""The second gentleman caught up with the first gentleman. He put his left hand over down across the shoulder, held him there and brought a machete around with his right hand and just held the gentleman there"" (T.262.49). There was a bit of a commotion like wrestling. The second man maintained his hold on the first man for a matter of seconds, after which the man who was restrained started to manoeuvre or worm himself out and push the other person off. ""They proceeded to turn around. Wrestle a bit. The first gentleman that was restrained yelled out 'hey hey', reached into a bag. Could see him searching around. Pulled the gun out point to the gentlemen's abdomen or body here [indicated] and just shot him"" (T.264.16).

40He saw the man place the barrel end of the pistol right on the stomach of Mr Rawas and then shoot him. Mr Kerr went inside the delicatessen and then heard another bang. ""It was like bang, bang. It was that quick."" (T.264.45) He saw the ""ethnic bloke"" hit the ground and at that time, two other persons wrestled the first man with the pistol and had him on the ground. As they were holding the gunman down on the ground, he was protesting and yelling and wanting to get them off. The man still had a pistol in his right hand when they had him sprawled out on the footpath. They were yelling ""Let go of the gun, let go of the gun"". 

41Exhibit J was shown to Mr Kerr and he was asked questions about the surveillance video. He agreed that the whole thing was a very quick event. He agreed that he heard the first shot when he was facing the footpath and heard the second shot as he was turning around, retreating through the door into the delicatessen. He agreed that in his statement to police, he said that he saw a man running with another man about a metre behind him. About two or three metres from the shop, the man with the machete grabbed the man in front with his left arm over the older man's left shoulder or around the top of his left arm, so his fists came into the older man's chest to hold him tight. He brought his right arm around the right side of the older man's head and brought the machete down across his throat, about level with the older man's Adam's apple. He said that the older man pulled himself away and reached into his bag all in one motion. (T.283-284)

42Mr Kerr agreed that he did not see how the first man managed to get free of the grip by the man with the machete. He said that the time between the two shots was one or two seconds. He did not resile from his evidence under cross-examination.

Alvin RONG

43Mr Rong was the owner of the delicatessen. He had a good view out of the front window and saw a man in dark clothing trying to get away from Jim, the owner of the Retravision shop. They were close together and it appeared to him that Jim wanted to take control of the man. There was a large knife near the neck of the man, but he could not see who was holding it. He estimated that he was about three metres away from the two men. He went to the back of his shop to call the police.

44As he was walking back from the rear of the shop, he heard two shots. He saw Mr Hines come from the Retravision shop and saw two staff from Retravision holding the other man on the ground. Jim was down on the ground at the time.

Benjimein BARKHO

45Mr Barkho was in the process of parking his car when he heard the fighting. He observed a man holding a big machete in his hand and then the fighters came together and went down. He called triple 0. He saw the machete in the old man's hand hitting Mr Hines and Mr Hines tried to get it from him. He could see Jimmy standing there screaming at a guy in front of him when he heard two gunshots. He saw Jimmy fall down on the floor and saw a young guy running away. Mr Barkho tried to follow the young man but was forced to stop at traffic lights.

George NUNEZ

46Mr Nunez worked at Retravision as an electrician. He was driving his car along Bunnerong Road, looking for a parking space. He saw a struggle between Jim and another man. Jim was trying to control the man. Jim was holding a machete in his right hand and the man had a pistol in one of his hands, but he was not sure which hand. He thought Jim was trying to use the machete to control the man. When he first saw the struggle, he thought that Kevin and Pedro were also there. By the time he parked his car, Jim had fallen down and another employee had arrived. Mr Nunez was about three - four metres away from where this was happening. The man that was being held down on the ground was not young - between 50 and 60. Mr Nunez said this was the same man he had seen in the struggle with Jim when they were still standing. He said that when he saw Jim he appeared weak and tired and was trying to swing the machete but it was ineffective and he did not hit the other man. 

Krista HEIKKANEN

47Ms Heikkanen was using the Commonwealth ATM on Bunnerong Road when she could see a few men in a scuffle and heard a gun go off. When she walked closer to the scene, she saw a man from Retravision had another man on the ground and that the gun was still in the man's hand. The man had his hand on the handle part of the gun. She could not recall if he had his finger near the trigger, but he was still just holding onto it. The man from Retravision was using a lot of force to hold his hands down (T.541-3). Under cross-examination she could not recall whether she heard one or two gunshots, although in her triple 0 call she had referred to ""gunshots"".

Darren TAAFFE

48Mr Taaffe was standing in line behind a couple of other people to use the ATM that morning when he saw a scuffle near the delicatessen down the road about 20 metres away. He saw three people together and then one person broke away and was heading in his direction. He described that person as being of small build and aged between 38-40.

49When Mr Taaffe saw the scuffle at first, it appeared that one man came up behind two other men and they were all standing, then one man broke away and the other two wrestled. He thought that he heard a gun as the man went past him. He thought he heard two shots, but he could not really remember.

50Mr Taaffe said that he then saw a man who he recognised as a salesman from Retravision enter the fight. He thought it was still just a scuffle, until he saw there was a gun pointing up the street at them. Other people from Retravision joined the fight. He saw the Retravision men trying to push the gun to the side. They were all on the ground striking the other person on the ground, who was resisting. The man on the ground was shouting ""get off me"", ""leave me alone"". Mr Taaffe called triple 0 and told the police what he had seen. On the recording of his call to triple 0, a voice in the background can be heard to say ""shit, jimmy's been shot"".

Lesley PANDOLEON

51There was a further eyewitness, Lesley Pandoleon. She was unavailable to give evidence at the trial. Over objection her police statement, dated 24 December 2002, was read (T.1160) as was the committal transcript of her evidence.

52In her police statement she said that she was walking along Bunnerong Road when she noticed the ""first male"" running towards her. She observed ""the second and third males"" running towards her. She could see that the second man had a machete in his right hand and that the third man was running in the same direction immediately behind the second man. Eventually the third man caught up to the second man and grabbed him. When the third man did this:

""The second male turned around to face the third male and lift his right hand with the machete in it up in the air like he was going to hit the third male with it. Then the third male wrapped both his arms around the second male before the second male could hit him with the machete. Then they both fell to the ground. They were both rolling around on the ground and the third male appeared to be trying to pin the second male to the ground. The second male was hitting the third male in the upper body with the machete. I could hear the third male yelling out ""help me, someone help me"". The second male was resisting a lot and appeared to be about to break free of the third male but the third male would not let go of him. At this stage I could see blood on one of their faces, but I can't remember which one. They were about 10 to 12 metres away from me while all this was happening. 

Then I started to walk towards them because I was concerned for the safety of the third male. I could see he was having great difficulty holding onto the second male. Then I heard a noise that sounded like a loud cap gun going off. I heard the sound twice in quick succession ... The two men were wrestling on the ground. It was then that I saw the second male had some sort of gun in his hand ... then about three males came running from the north on the same footpath ... they jumped in and helped restrain the second male ..."" (T.1161)

53At the committal hearing, Ms Pandoleon gave evidence that she got the role of the second and third males muddled up in her statement and that it was the older man who was being chased by a man with an olive complexion carrying a machete in his hands. She also said that she initially did not know what was going on ""because this guy's got a knife in his hand and chasing the other one"". She said that they stopped running and started hitting each other, eventually falling to the ground and wrestling. She said:

""A. The second guy with the machete was hitting the other one and in my opinion it wasn't sharp because he wasn't bleeding profusely or anything. I saw maybe a bit of blood but it wasn't anything bad. Then they just fell down on the ground like wrestling around.

Q. Then what happened? They were wrestling down on the ground?
A. I heard like a sound like a pop gun go off then I heard it again."" (T.1170.44-1171.5)

POLICE INVESTIGATION

Constable STEEL

54Senior Constable Steel and Constable Hasham were nearby and arrived first on the scene. They observed three males holding a man face down on the ground. He was wearing a blue and red windcheater with a beige shirt underneath, blue jeans and joggers. One of the males, Kevin Hines, was holding a black coloured pistol in his right hand. The appellant was taken into custody. They found $150 neatly folded in the front left pocket of the appellant's jeans. Plastic bags were placed over the appellant's hands to preserve gunshot residue. Shortly thereafter, paper bags were substituted for the plastic bags.

Constable MORIATY

55Senior Constable Sharyn Moriarty from the Sydney Crime Scene Section attended the scene at 10am on 24 December 2002. When she arrived, she was shown a plastic bag containing $2000 in cash. A Webley and Scott 6 shot revolver with the hammer cocked was shown to her and there appeared to be blood around the tip of the barrel. Among the items lying on the footpath were two closed plastic cable ties with blood-staining, a pair of damaged glasses with both lenses lying nearby, two further cable ties and several blood-stained areas on the footpath. She observed a large knife with a wooden carved handle and a blade of approximately 40 cms, which appeared to be bloodstained around the middle of the blade. Nearby she observed seven cable ties scattered over the footpath.

56Senior Constable Moriarty made an examination of the Retravision store. Contained therein was a blue, black and yellow Newstar backpack which Mr Haedo had picked up at the scene and taken back to the shop for safekeeping. Inside the bag was a pair of yellow, medium, 'Golden Gripper' gloves, a roll of 3M packing tape and a small razor. In the office area were cable ties, similar to those found scattered on the footpath, various patches of blood were present on the carpet and stairs. A digital television box and a DVD box both had small bullet sized holes in them.

Constable FORSYTH

57Detective Senior Constable Forsyth was present on 27 December 2002 with other officers when a search warrant was executed at the appellant's residence in Goulburn, which was videotaped. Items discovered at the premises and tendered in the Crown case included: Exhibit U - 7 pairs of medium Hepworth Flock-lined Golden Gripper gloves; Exhibit V - 2 packets of S 527 cable ties; Exhibit W - 1 loose plastic cable tie, located in lounge room; Detective Forsyth transported those items to the Division of Analytical Laboratories for testing.

Mr Van Der WALT

58Mr Van der Walt was a forensic ballistic expert attached to the Forensic Services Group of the NSW Police Service. He attended the post mortem of the deceased. The bullet path through the body of the deceased was determined to be from left to right, front to back and slightly downwards.

Constable HEANEY

59Detective Senior Constable Heaney attended Prince of Wales Hospital at about 1.25pm on the afternoon of the incident. He observed Senior Constable Peasley remove the paper bags from over the appellant's hands and take gunshot residue swabs from each hand. He also took a buccal swab from the appellant. The appellant had a deep laceration to each index finger, but there were no cuts to the appellant's neck.

Constable FOX

60Senior Constable Fox was a fingerprint expert. He examined a number of items from the scene and the office at Retravision, including the vacuum cleaner, the money found on the appellant and the pistol. Very few of the fingerprints he detected were of suitable enough quality to identify or compare. No fingerprints were recovered that could be matched to the appellant or co-offender.

Ms HALES

61Ms Hales was a scientific officer with the Forensic Services Group of the NSW Police. Gunshot residue was detected in the samples taken from the back of the appellant's right hand, the left palm and from the paper bag which had been placed over his right hand. No gunshot residue was detected from the palm of the appellant's right hand, the back of his left hand or the bag placed over his left hand. The gunshot primer residue particles detected were consistent with those recovered from the TV box in the office and the fired cartridge case from the scene of the shooting. 

Appellant's evidence

62The appellant gave evidence to the following effect. He had received $4000 in cash from friends to place as a bet on horse races at Gosford. His son owned racehorses and one of them, ""Misled"", would be ready for a race at Gosford on 31 December 2002. The $4000 was to be used to bet on that horse in that race. His friend, Scott Brown, was driving for him because the appellant's eyes were not good enough to do so himself.

63The appellant and Mr Brown left Goulburn for Sydney on Monday, 23 December at about 5am. When in Sydney the appellant was going to visit some friends, who lived at different locations. He believed one of those friends, Glen Martin, worked at Retravision and that is why he was in that location.

64On the morning of the incident, he and Mr Brown had waited in the vicinity of the Retravision store. They had arrived at 8am but the store did not open until 9am. While he was waiting, he saw two men enter the store. He then went over and knocked on the door of the store four different times, but no one came. The appellant walked to the delicatessen when he heard a door slam. He turned around and the taller person whom he had seen enter the Retravision store ran right into him and they both fell to the footpath. When he turned around, he saw another older person with a blue tracksuit running south, so that the two men were running in different directions. 

65As the appellant and the taller person hit the ground, a man with a machete came running up and grabbed the taller person and said ""you bastard, you robbed my shop"". The taller person said ""Let go or I'll shoot you"". The appellant then saw that the taller person had a pistol in his right hand. The appellant wrapped his arms around the man with the pistol from behind and got his left hand on it. Just then the pistol fired and the man with the machete let go of the person with the pistol. He swung around and smacked the appellant over the head with the pistol. The appellant grabbed his hands to try to keep the pistol pointed away from himself and wrestled for the pistol. The appellant thought another shot was fired while he was wrestling for the pistol.

66The man let go of the pistol and ran off and the Retravision staff were running straight towards him and the person with the machete. As the man ran off, a strap on his backpack half hooked on the appellant's hand and the pistol causing the man to drop it. The man with the machete then grabbed the appellant, as did Mr Haedo the shorter person from Retravision. There was pushing and shoving so that the three of them fell to the footpath. The appellant landed face down with Mr Haedo on top of him. He still had the pistol in his left hand by the barrel back to front under his chest, and could not move his hands. It was the squared edge on the front of the pistol which tore his finger, not the machete. 

67Thereafter, all the appellant could recall was being punched and kicked as he tried to push the pistol away. The backpack, the rubber gloves found inside it and the cable ties were not his. He agreed that the rubber gloves found at his house belonged to him. He used the gloves because he suffered from dermatitis. The cable ties at his house belonged to him. He was intending to use the ties to attach some belting to the bottom rail of a fence to prevent his granddaughter's pony from escaping. He denied that the long cable tie found at the house was his.

68Under cross-examination the appellant's evidence was as follows. That morning he had $4000 in his pocket, not $2000. He suggested the police must have stolen the balance. He had a clear recollection of two men loitering outside the Retravision shop. He said he was not wearing a blue tracksuit, but blue jeans with a blue tracksuit top. He denied having a backpack or bag with him. He said that he only had what he was standing up in, as he was going to the eye hospital and then he was going straight home on the train. He had left his two overnight bags in the car with Mr Brown.

69He explained various entries in his diary relating to contacts with Glen Martin at Retravision, staying in Sydney and attending the Sydney Eye Hospital. He said he had booked into a hotel in Kingsford and had also paid for Scott Brown's hotel room. Mr Brown was to use the car to drive the appellant around, which was more convenient and cheaper than using taxis.

70He agreed that the police had painted something on his hands to test for gunshot residue, but he did not have a good memory of the procedure. He agreed that his finger was badly cut, right to the bone, but disagreed that this was from the machete. He said that his DNA was not found on the machete, but had only been found on the pistol. He fell on the pistol, not on the machete. The reason he had gunshot residue on his hands was because he put his arms around the tall guy and over part of the pistol in front of the trigger. 

71He agreed that he knew Glen Martin and that they were good friends but denied that he knew that he had ceased working for Retravision in October 2002. He agreed that he had received a telephone call from Mr Martin on 11 October 2002, the day that he ceased working at Retravision but denied that Mr Martin had passed that information onto him. He could not remember the content of the conversations he had with Mr Martin at about that time. 

72The appellant agreed that he had hold of the gunman when that person shot Mr Rawas. He had hold of him from behind and had his arms around him. He agreed that any observer would have seen a third man at that time. When the observations of eyewitnesses were put to him, the appellant adhered to his evidence in chief. He said that at no time did he have the machete at his throat. He had his hand around the barrel of the pistol with the idea of pushing it out to the side. He just got his hand on it but he could not push it to the side at all and ""bang"" it went off. He did not know if the gunman had hold of Mr Rawas, because he [the appellant] was behind him. 

73The sequence of events was that he reached around and grabbed the pistol with his left hand and then the pistol went off, and then the gunman hit the appellant on the forehead with the pistol. The appellant reached and grabbed the gunman's hand with the pistol and his wrist with his other hand and tried to keep the pistol turned away from him. The appellant believed that while the pistol was in the air another shot was fired. When Mr Haedo came up and wrapped his arms around the appellant, Mr Rawas was still standing. Mr Rawas was still standing and moved a step forward and grabbed the appellant by the right arm. The appellant had hold of the pistol and when the gunman turned towards the wall to go, the strap on the backpack pulled on the appellant's hand. He explained the residue on his hands because he had his hands right on the pistol, trying to pull it around when it fired.

74The appellant denied that he had heard people saying to him ""Let it go, let it go"". He denied that he said anything like ""You've got me"". He denied that he had refused to release the pistol. He had let the pistol go and it was right out in front of him, just as Mr Cole had described it.

THE APPEAL
Ground 1: The learned trial judge erred in declining the application made by the appellant at his trial that there was ""no case"" on the charge of murder based on the principle of ""felony murder"".

75It was common ground that the murder charge preferred against the appellant was based on s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). That section relevantly provided:

""18 (1) 

(a) Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person, or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years.

(b) Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be manslaughter.""

76As was made clear in the Crown's opening address, the sole basis upon which the Crown presented the charge of murder to the jury was the final limb of s 18, i.e. that the appellant fatally shot the deceased ""during or immediately after the commission"" of the offence of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon - felony murder.

77Towards the end of the trial, a ""no case"" submission (T.1367-1372) was made on behalf of the appellant to the effect that the shooting of the deceased did not occur ""during or immediately"" after the armed robbery and consequently, the felony murder count should be dismissed. This application was declined by the trial judge. The application had two parts, which can best be described as the ""contextual part"" and the ""novus actus part"". Ground of Appeal 1 raises these same issues.

78In relation to the ""contextual part"" of Ground 1, the appellant submitted that when the entirety of the events of 24 December 2002 was considered in their true and proper context, the shooting of the deceased did not occur either ""during or immediately after"" the armed robbery.

79He submitted that by reference to the particular facts of this case, the armed robbery itself was complete at the very moment the offenders, standing in or about the rear office of the store, took physical possession of the money and/or mobile phones and/or notebooks from the bags of the deceased and Mr Haedo respectively. Thus, the shooting could not be said to have occurred on any view ""during"" the commission of the armed robbery.

80The appellant sought support from the following observation by Barwick CJ in Ryan v R [1967] HCA 2; 121 CLR 205 at 226:

""Can it properly be said that either the presentation of the gun or its discharge was done during the commission of the robbery and wounding? Upon the facts the robbery with arms was complete before either the presentation or the discharge of the gun so that the only part of the offence under s 98 during which either of these acts could have been done was the wounding. ...""

81The appellant put the proposition in another way by asking - Had the police apprehended the offenders within the store a split second after they had taken possession of the money and/or mobile phones and/or notebooks, could the offenders have been criminally liable for armed robbery? The appellant submitted that the answer must surely be an affirmative one which confirmed that the offence was undoubtedly complete by that point in time.

82In relation to whether the shooting occurred ""immediately after"" the commission of the armed robbery, the appellant submitted that the shooting did not occur at a time that could reasonably be described as ""immediately after"" but that it occurred at some time later.

83The appellant submitted that the robbery took place in the rear office of the store. The robbery was complete the very moment the offenders took possession of the various items of property. By that point in time, the three occupants of the rear office of the store had already been dealt with in that they had been tied up using cable ties. Thereafter, he submitted, the offenders had left the rear office and exited the store premises through the front door. There was no scuffle or the like between the taking of the property and the offenders' exit from the premises via the front door. Rather, the offenders having committed the robbery, made a ""clean getaway"" from the scene of the crime, namely the store premises. The appellant submitted that from that point in time onwards what occurred did not occur ""immediately after"" the commission of the armed robbery. This was because the provision when properly construed envisages a scenario where, for instance, an offender accidentally (but voluntarily) shoots someone in the store following the taking of possession of the property.

84The appellant sought support for that proposition from R v Burke [1983] 2 NSWLR 93. There the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the application of self-defence to felony murder. In doing so, Miles J (with whom Street CJ and Nagle CJ at CL agreed) said at 104:

""Where the prosecution alleges ""felony-murder"", or more precisely, the fourth category of murder provided in the Crimes Act, s 18(1), the mental element accompanying the act causing death is irrelevant so long as that act can be said to be the act of the accused. If the mental state of the accused is irrelevant there is, so it seems to me, considerable conceptual difficulty in relating the issue of self-defence (and other matters affecting criminal responsibility such as provocation) to the doctrine of felony murder. That difficulty was I think with respect, recognised by his Honour the trial judge in his reference to Viro's case: In order to raise self-defence the appellant is required to put significant distance between the original aggressive act on his own part, in this case the armed robbery, and the subsequent act causing death, in this case the firing of the rifle. If the firing of the rifle occurred as part and parcel of the armed robbery, the appellant cannot rely upon it as an act done in self-defence. If on the other hand the firing of the rifle occurred after the acts constituting an armed robbery had come to an end, that is to say after the aggressor had broken off his attack, then it cannot be said to have occurred during or even immediately after the crime punishable by penal servitude for life upon which the Crown relies for the purpose of the felony murder rule. Accordingly, in the latter event the appellant would be entitled to an acquittal on the charge of murder, not because he has succeeded on self-defence but because the Crown has not proved felony murder as alleged. Speak of self-defence in these circumstances is to raise a false issue.""

85The appellant sought support from R v Hitchins; R v Elliot [1983] 3 NSWLR 318 at 324C where Lee J (with whom Street CJ and Enderby J agreed) said:

""In my view counsel's submission should not be upheld. What s98 plainly contemplates is that the act of wounding is to have a relationship both in fact and in time for the robbery and not be regarded as a matter unassociated with that event. But the word ""immediately"" does not require to be given a meaning which would restrict the application of the section to an event occurring within seconds or minutes of the termination of those particular actions which constituted in law a robbery of the victim. The whole of the circumstances involved in the robbery must be looked at and a decision made against the entire context of the evidence in regard thereto.

The evidence in the present case disclosed, or at least the jury were entitled to infer, that the appellants and De Vries, from the time they entered the taxi, intended that the taxi driver should be robbed and attacked with knives and left in a remote spot and that from the time the taxi arrived at Cammeray - if it ever went there of course - until the time it reached Hoxton Park, the driver was under the menace of the knives of the robbers. On this view the jury could regard the whole incident as but one episode involving a robbery with violence which resulted in the death of the taxi driver. It was open to the jury to conclude that the wounding and ""dumping"" of the taxi driver was an integral part of the plan to rob him and that the fact that he was not stabbed and left in some street in Cammeray had no significance against the facts established in the evidence showing an overall plan which linked his death directly to the robbery.

In my view his Honour was correct in leaving the question whether the wounding followed ""immediately after"" the robbery to the jury as a question of fact for their determination.""

86What the appellant sought to extract from R v Hitchins; R v Elliot was that every situation must be analysed in its own context and that ultimately the whole sequence of events in that case was but one episode. That was to be contrasted with the facts of this case where the offenders had well and truly completed the armed robbery and the events which occurred afterwards could not be regarded as in any way part of the earlier episode.

87The appellant sought support for this ground of appeal from the observations of Gleeson CJ (with whom Priestley JA and Campbell J agreed) in R v Attard (NSWCCA unreported, 20 April 1993). At pp 7 -8 Gleeson CJ said:

""The present case gave rise to no particular difficulty concerning the application of the words of the statute. The act of the appellant in shooting Nicholas Ikonomopoulos occurred within a minute or so of the wounding of his father, and in the course of a fight between the robbers and their victims which began whilst the robbery was in progress. It occurred in the immediate vicinity of the robbery, and was part of the immediate aftermath of that event. The shooting and the robbery with wounding were so closely linked in point of time, place and circumstance that it could scarcely be doubted that the one occurred immediately after the other.""

88The appellant submitted that by reference to those observations, the present case was not one in which it could be said that the shooting occurred ""immediately after"" the commission of the armed robbery. That was to be contrasted with Attard where the shooting occurred at the end of an episode of fighting which actually began in the course of the robbery and in the shop owner's premises.

89In relation to the novus actus part of this ground of appeal, the appellant submitted that even if the shooting were otherwise to be characterised as having occurred ""during or immediately after"" the commission of the armed robbery, the actions of the deceased leading up to his exit from the store and thereafter were such that the act causing death (i.e. the shooting which followed in time), did not occur ""during or immediately after"" the commission of the foundational offence (i.e. the armed robbery) in that the ""causal link"" or ""nexus"" between the two events comprising the compound offence of felony murder was broken by the intervening actions of the deceased.

90The basis for this submission was that following the offenders' exit from the premises (i.e. after the foundational crime occurred), the deceased proceeded to take on a role as the aggressor. The appellant submitted that after yelling out ""bastards"", he ran to the front door armed with a machete in pursuit of the offenders. The bystander witnesses who observed the events on the footpath outside the delicatessen described them as ""horrifying"" in circumstances where the deceased was holding a machete to the throat of the appellant. There was no suggestion that the appellant, although in possession of a pistol, had been displaying it, making demands or otherwise manifesting an intent to shoot the deceased outside the delicatessen.

91The appellant submitted that the deceased, armed with a machete, had him in a potentially life-threatening situation (over and above that required to execute a citizen's ordinary arrest) and that the shooting occurred as a direct response to the then extreme, excessive and unreasonable actions of the deceased. The appellant submitted that this was consistent with the various observations of the bystanders.

92The appellant relied upon the following evidence to support the submission:

(i) The deceased had jumped on the appellant's back and was also biting him and screaming.

(ii) The deceased was actually hitting the appellant with his machete.

(iii) The appellant was heard to yell out ""help me, someone help me"".

(iv) The appellant went fumbling through his pack for his gun, he not having hitherto held the pistol since leaving the store.

(v) The deceased was still holding the machete at the time that he was shot.

(vi) The deceased lunged (whilst still holding the machete) and grabbed the appellant even after he was shot.

93The appellant submitted that any ""causal link"" or ""nexus"" between the foundational crime and the act causing death, which together comprised the compound offence, was effectively severed by virtue of the excessive acts of the deceased. He submitted that it was neither necessary nor reasonable for the deceased to create a situation in which he needed to attack the throat of the appellant with a machete on the footpath outside the delicatessen. He submitted that in doing so, the deceased created a new situation and thereby cut the required ""causal link"" or ""nexus"" between the commission of the armed robbery offence and the act causing death.

94The appellant sought to support that proposition by reference to Royall v R [1991] HCA 27; (1991) 172 CLR 378 at 412 where Deane and Dawson JJ said in relation to criminal liability:

""... However, in many cases of murder, particularly where a single act such as shooting or stabbing is alleged, it may be unnecessary to elaborate the requirement that the death should have been caused by the accused. In other cases it may be appropriate to point out that the causal chain must not be broken by some intervening event which operates to relieve the accused of responsibility, but such a direction would ordinarily be better put by reference to the actual facts of the case than couched in abstract terms.

If, in a case of fright or self-preservation, the victim over-reacts to the threatening acts or words of the accused, that may be sufficient to break the chain of causation. ...""

95The appellant also relied upon the following statements of principle in the self-defence cases to support the submission:

""In my opinion, in Australia the fact that the person raising self-defence was the aggressor is an important consideration of fact, but not a legal barrier to the success of the plea. The matter may be regarded in a similar light to a failure to retreat. It is obvious enough that a person cannot rely upon the plea of self-defence unless the violence against which he sought to defend himself was unlawful. If, therefore, one man makes a violent attack upon another with intent to rob him, and the man attacked defends himself, using no more force than is reasonably necessary, the original assailant cannot be said to be acting in self-defence in trying to overcome the other's resistance, since that resistance was lawful. However, if the original assailant has desisted from his attack, and his intended victim no longer needs to defend himself, and cannot reasonably believe that he is still in danger, but nevertheless takes the offensive and out of anger or revenge himself becomes the attacker, the original assailant is not obliged to let himself be killed or injured without any attempt at resistance. Nevertheless, in such a case it is difficult to see how, as a matter of fact, the conduct of the aggressor, which commences as a criminal assault with an intent to commit a serious crime, can become transmuted in split seconds into lawful self-defence, unless the aggressor has clearly broken off his attack. In such circumstances the fact that he did not retreat when he had the opportunity to do so assumes a special significance."" (Viro v R [1978] HCA 9; 141 CLR 88 - Gibbs CJ at 116 -7)

""Where an accused person raising a plea of self-defence as the original aggressor and induced or provoked the assault against which he claims the right to defend himself, it will be for the jury to consider whether the original aggression had ceased so as to have enabled the accused to form a belief, upon reasonable grounds, that his actions were necessary in self-defence. For this purpose, it will be relevant to consider the extent to which the accused declined further conflict and quit the use of force or retreated from it, these being matters which may bear upon the nature of the occasion and the use which the accused made of it. Indeed, even in circumstances in which the accused was not the original aggressor, retreat in the face of a threat of violence before resort to force may be relevant to the belief of the accused or the reasonableness of the grounds upon which the accused based his belief. There is, however, no longer any rule that the accused must have retreated as far as possible before attempting to defend himself. It is a circumstance to be considered with all the others in determining whether the accused believed upon reasonable grounds that what he did was necessary in self-defence ..."" (Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) [1987] HCA 26; 162 CLR 645 (Wilson Dawson and Toohey JJ at 663.))

96By reference to those statements of principle, the appellant submitted that the acts of the deceased had the common sense and practical effect of operating as a supervening event in relation to the charge of felony murder, such that the ""nexus"" between the shooting and the armed robbery was broken; or expressed differently, the shooting did not occur ""immediately after"" the commission of the armed robbery, but occurred in a context disconnected from the armed robbery.

Consideration

97For the appellant's contextual submission to succeed, this Court would have to find that the facts of this case could not come within the statutory framework of s 18(1)(a), i.e. the shooting could not have occurred ""during or immediately after"" the armed robbery. There is no statutory definition of the phrase ""during or immediately after"". Some guidance, however, has been provided as to the interpretation of the phrase by the cases.

98As the appellant pointed out, this Court considered the phrase in R v Hitchins and Elliot. The issue arose because a taxi had been hailed by the offenders at Cammeray and subsequently the body of the taxi driver was found stabbed to death at Hoxton Park. It was not known at what point in the journey the killing had occurred. A submission similar to that made in this appeal was raised by the appellants in that matter. At 324B-E Lee J said:

""The submission of the applicants was thus a submission that if the robbery took place at Cammeray and the killing at Hoxton Park it was not open to the jury to find that the wounding took place ""immediately after"" the robbery and that accordingly his Honour's direction that the jury could so find was erroneous. Although there was no precise evidence given as to the distance from Cammeray to Hoxton Park, it was agreed between counsel before us that it would probably take at least about three-quarters of an hour to drive there from Cammeray.

In my view counsel's submission should not be upheld. What s98 plainly contemplates is that the act of wounding is to have a relationship both in fact and in time to the robbery, and not be regarded as a matter unassociated with that event. But the word ""immediately"" does not require to be given a meaning which would restrict the application of the section to an event occurring within seconds or minutes of the termination of those particular actions which constituted in law a robbery of the victim. The whole of the circumstances involved in the robbery must be looked at and a decision made against the entire context of the evidence in regard thereto.""

99What I take from that passage is that there is a temporal component and a contextual component associated with the phrase. Insofar as the temporal component is concerned, the evidence is that the time between the offenders leaving the office and the shooting taking place was somewhere between 1 - 3 minutes. That estimate is supported by the fact that the distance between the office where the deceased and other employees were left and the delicatessen where the shooting took place was about 30 metres. However, as Gleeson CJ said in Attard, the overarching consideration is the wording of the statute.

100Guidance is also provided by Gleeson CJ in Attard at pp 6-7 where his Honour said:

""Ultimately the point of substance involved in this aspect of the appeal concerns the directions given by Sharp J to the jury as to how they were to approach the task of deciding whether the act of the appellant causing the death of the victim occurred ""immediately after"" the robbery with wounding.

His Honour pointed to the requirement that the act be done ""during or immediately after"" the commission of the felony in question and he told the jury that what was involved was a question of fact and degree for them to determine in the light of all the evidence. He did not elaborate much upon the meaning of the expression ""immediately after"", but he drew the jury's attention to the facts and circumstances relevant to their decision on that point in the case. His Honour said that there was no hard and fast rule as to the meaning of ""immediately"" but it meant much the same as ""forthwith"". That direction was taken from the observation of Cockburn CJ in The Queen v The Justices of Berkshire (1878) 4 QBD 469 at 471.

This subject was considered by Miles J in R v Burke (1983) 2 NSWLR 93 at 103-4 and Lee J in R v Hitchins; R v Elliot [1983] 3 NSWLR 318 at 324. The history of felony murder was discussed by Windeyer J in Ryan v R (1967) 121 CLR 205 at 239-246.

The observations of Miles J were made in the context of an examination of the relationship between the concepts of felony murder and self-defence, and his Honour's references to the aggression and to breaking off an attack had to be understood in that light. What Lee J called the relationship in time and fact between the felony and the killing is governed by the language of the statute. The words ""immediately after"" clearly add something of significance to the word ""during"", but their precise ambit will fall to be determined in the light of the facts and circumstances of the individual case.

It is not difficult to imagine borderline cases where the relationship in fact in time between the felony and the killing is such that a decision as to whether the latter occurred ""immediately after"" the former could involve a difficult judgment on a matter of degree. Even in such cases, it may be doubted whether there is much to be gained by instructing a jury in terms which substitute for the language of the statute some other verbal formula whose meaning is no more clear. There may be a danger in doing so.""

101What emerges from Attard is that the issue of whether or not the act was done ""during or immediately after"" the armed robbery is a question of fact for the jury. It is a question of fact in the same way that ""grievous bodily harm"" has no fixed legal meaning and should be left to the jury. These are situations where there may be no doubt whatsoever as to what the act is, what the injury is, or what the event is, but because these phrases lack a fixed legal meaning their application to the facts of a particular case should be decided by the jury.

102What the jury could take into account on the facts of this case was that the act of the appellant in shooting the deceased occurred within 1 - 3 minutes of the armed robbery. It occurred in close proximity to where the armed robbery took place and was part of the immediate aftermath of that event. The jury could have found that the shooting and the armed robbery were so closely linked in point of time, place and circumstance that it could scarcely be doubted that the one occurred immediately after the other.

103Those were findings which were well open to the jury on the facts. That being so, it would have been an error on the part of the trial judge to have taken that issue away from the jury on a no case to answer basis. The jury was entitled to consider whether the facts as they found them came within the phrase ""immediately after"". This part of Ground of Appeal 1 has not been made out.

104The second part of the first Ground of Appeal, which has been described by the appellant as the ""novus actus"" submission, in reality raises the same issue as has just been discussed. It is simply another way of challenging the proposition that the shooting occurred ""during or immediately after"" the armed robbery.

105The formulation of the submission is contrary to the well established principle stated in R v Munro (1981) 4 A Crim R 67 at 69 where Street CJ (with whom Nagle CJ at CL and Slattery J agreed) said:

""The second ground argued is summarised as involving a contention that there must be a causal connection between the felonious wounding and the subsequent death. Section 96 provides for penal servitude for life where there is an offence committed under s 95 and the person who commits it also wounds the victim. The argument has been developed by reference to the decision of the High Court in Ryan (1967) 121 CLR 205 and to discussions in academic writing. The argument, in my view, overlooks both the clear terms of the relevant sections and the accepted approach to problems of this nature. As for example, in the High Court in Mraz (1955) 93 CLR 493.

Section 18, in the relevant portion, provides that:

""Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused ... causing the death charged, was done ... during or immediately after the commission, by the accused ... of the crime punishable by death or penal servitude for life.""

In the present case the act of the accused causing death was the striking. It clearly enough was not the wounding, in as much as, although there was some wounding in the sense of broken skin in the facial area, the cause of death was shown by medical evidence to have been the result of the bruising and fractured ribs.

There was relevant requirement of a causal link between the felony relied upon as constituting the homicide one of felony murder and the death other than stated in s 18(1)(a) itself, that is to say the act of the accused causing death was done during or immediately after the committing of a life sentence crime. Clearly enough if it were the wounds inflicted in the committing of a crime under s 96 which led to the death then that would amount to felony murder. But I fail to see that this is an essential requirement.""

106That statement of principle was confirmed by this Court in R v Spathis; R v Patsalis [2001] NSWCCA 476 at [312] - [313] where Heydon JA (with whom Carruthers and Smart JJ agreed) said:

""312 Secondly, it was contended that the trial judge failed properly to direct the jury regarding the causal relationship to be established by the Crown before they could convict either accused of felony murder. Accepting that no specific intent is required for proof of felony murder, the Crown was still required to establish a causal relationship between the underlying felony and the resulting unlawful death. This, it was argued, required a direction to the jury that the death of the victim was a foreseeable result of the underlying felony, i.e., armed robbery with wounding. Again, this submission is quite inconsistent with established authority that the act causing death need not be in furtherance of the common unlawful purpose: see Sharah at 297-298 citing R v Johns [1978] 1 NSWLR 282, particularly at 294-295.


313 Twenty years ago in R v Munro (1981) 4 A Crim R 67 this Court (Street CJ, Nagle CJ at CL and Slattery J) expressly rejected the proposition that there should be recognised some requirement of foreseeability and causal link between the foundational offence and the act causing death. Nothing has been put before this Court to justify the submission that Munro was wrongly decided.""

107The reliance on the self-defence cases to support the appellant's submission on this issue is not helpful. The facts of those cases are far removed from those considered here. More importantly, those cases raise issues which were properly rejected as irrelevant by Miles J in R v Burke (see [80] hereof). As Miles J made clear at the conclusion of that citation, the issue is not one of self-defence or even novus actus, but whether the facts as found came within the relevant provisions of the statute.

108There is another difficulty with the ""novus actus"" submission. It depends upon selective extracts from the evidence. The facts relied upon to justify the submission are those which suggest that the deceased immediately before the shooting acted in an aggressive way motivated by revenge and was attempting to attack the appellant in a way which invited or required a defensive reaction by him. The evidence as a whole does not support such a conclusion.

109The evidence that the deceased jumped on the appellant's back and was biting him and screaming came from one bystander witness only (Mr Cole). It was not the evidence given by him at trial but that given in the committal hearing. It was contrary to the observation of all of the other bystanders, who referred to the deceased attempting to control or restrain the appellant by the use of the machete, in particular that he was holding the machete at or to the appellant's throat.

110The evidence that the appellant was heard to yell out ""help me, someone help me"" came from the statement of Ms Pandoleon, who was unavailable to give evidence and be cross-examined at the trial and whose evidence on most issues was inconsistent with that of every other bystander. She freely conceded in her evidence in the committal proceedings that she was confused as to the identity of the various persons she observed.

111The reference to the appellant fumbling through his bag for his pistol was from a statement of Mr Cole. It is taken out of context and does not accurately set out the effect of his evidence.

112The full extract from paragraph 18 of the statement was:

""18 As he said this, he reached into the black back pack that he still had in front of him and pulled the gun out. He just stuck his hand in, his right hand I think and was fumbling around as if he was feeling for something. Then he pulled the gun out.""

In his oral evidence, Mr Cole said:

""He just took the gun out of the bag and just went ""boom"" and as he was doing that, reached into the bag, somehow spun around, turned, flung him off and just shot him from about two feet away."" (T.237.9)

The evidence of Mr Kerr on this subject was:

""[He] reached into a bag. Could see him searching around. Pulled the gun out, point to the gentleman's abdomen or body here [indicated] and just shot him."" (T.264.18)

113There was no evidence that the deceased was actually striking at the appellant with the machete. Apart from that, the most significant factual difficulty with the submission is that the appellant suffered no injuries to his neck, or any other part of his body, except his index fingers. This is inconsistent with the proposition that he was being hit or struck with the machete, or that the deceased was attempting to strike him with the machete, as distinct from threatening him with it so as to restrain him and prevent him from escaping. Had the deceased intended to use the machete to attack the appellant, one would have expected the appellant to have sustained wounds consistent with that intention.

114Accordingly, it was well open to the jury to find that the shooting occurred ""during or immediately after"" the armed robbery. It follows, therefore, that the appellant's application at trial that there was ""no case"" on the charge of felony murder was properly rejected by the trial judge. This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 2: The learned trial judge erred in his directions to the jury on the issue of the appellant's liability to be convicted of murder on the basis of felony murder.

115In his summing up to the jury, the trial judge said:

""Firstly I deal with the ingredients of the crime of murder as charged. You will recall that the Crown has referred to the charge of murder brought against both accused to be considered separately, as felony murder. 

...

The crime of murder as alleged in this case is committed where the act of the accused which caused the death of the deceased was done by him during or immediately after the commission by the accused or some other accomplice with him of a crime such as robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon, or indeed, an attempt to commit such a crime ... (S/U 19)

...

Logically, members of the jury, the first thing that the Crown must establish is that the accused or an accomplice committed a crime of the type of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon. 

...

In the present case the Crown puts to you, you would have no doubt that whoever committed the crime of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, were accomplices in the usual sense of the word. Indeed, members of the jury, though I'll come to this in greater detail later on, there has really been no argument in this case that whoever committed the crime of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, is guilty of the crime of murder as well."" (S/U 20-21)

...

Members of the jury, they are the ingredients of the crimes with which both accused stand charged. It is for the Crown to establish those ingredients beyond reasonable doubt. As I have indicated, there is not much issue that whoever it was who entered the Retravision store at about 9 o'clock on 24 December 2002, was guilty of all those crimes. The question is: Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that it was either (a) Patrick Hudd or (b) Scott Brown who committed those crimes? (S/U 24)

...

Now members of the jury, the Crown case against the accused Hudd is that he, having taken part in the crime of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a .38 revolver, shot and killed James Rawas during or immediately after the commission of that crime. That, simply put, is the Crown case. The duration of that period or immediately after would extend to such time as somebody had made good a total escape from the scene of the crime so you may take it that, if you are satisfied that it was the accused Hudd who shot Mr Rawas outside Bon's Delicatessen that that would have happened during or immediately after the commission of the crime of armed robbery provided, of course, that you are satisfied it was Mr Hudd who took part in the robbery and it was Mr Hudd who did the shooting."" (S/U 31)

116The appellant submitted that although his Honour had rejected his ""no case"" submission, it was still necessary in order to convict for felony murder that the jury be actually satisfied that the act causing death occurred ""during or immediately after"" the foundational crime. The appellant submitted that the jury was prevented from carrying out that function because the effect of the directions which the trial judge gave was to take away this consideration.

117The appellant submitted that regardless of how his defence case was put at trial, the Crown still had to prove that the act causing death did occur ""during or immediately after"" the commission of the foundational crime and that this issue (following the rejection of the ""no case"" submission), needed to have been properly left to the jury. The appellant submitted that the failure to effectively do so constituted a substantial miscarriage of justice.

118The appellant made this submission because of the way in which his case was put at trial. His counsel early in his address to the jury said:

""Let me make some banal observations. Where this murder occurred - and there is no doubt that a murder did occur; it is not Mr Hudd's case that a murder did not occur; it's simply that he did not commit it - was in the Matraville community. The person who was a victim of this gruesome murder was a popular man there is no doubt, because it's common ground, that immediately after, or at the time - it's a matter for you just what happened - but certainly immediately after a man was caught with a gun. It makes a lot of sense to say that that person with the gun caught straight after is the guilty person. I don't shrink from that. It is a heavy point which the Crown must have, and does have and properly has, nothing improper about that and which your instincts at first blush will tell you ""well, this bloke must have done it. No doubt about that"". But at this moment we're not looking at the evidence"". (T. 1450.41)

Consideration

119The question of whether the act causing death occurred ""during or immediately after"" the armed robbery was a matter which should have been left to the jury. This is so for the reasons set out in relation to Ground of Appeal 1. It was an issue which should not have been taken away from the jury. The way in which his Honour summed up in effect precluded the jury from turning its mind to this issue. His Honour's failure to leave this matter to the jury did give rise to error and to a miscarriage of justice.

120That does not end the matter. The Court is required to assess the effect of the miscarriage of justice, i.e. does the proviso apply? 

121Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides:

""6(1) The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.""

122Cases such as Weiss v R [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300, Gassy v The Queen [2008] HCA 18; 236 CLR 293 and Cooper v The Queen [2012] HCA 50; 87 ALJR 32 make it clear that an erroneous direction to a jury does not without more, mean that the proviso cannot apply. The primary consideration is whether ""no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"", i.e. the words of the statute have to be applied (Gassy at [32] - [34] (Gummow and Hayne JJ)).

123The recent decision of the High Court in Cooper confirmed that the approach to be followed by a Court of Criminal Appeal when considering the proviso was that prescribed in Weiss. In Weiss the task of an appellate court was described as follows:

""35 The fundamental task committed to the appellate court by the common form of criminal appeal statute is to decide the appeal. In so far as that task requires considering the proviso, it is not to be undertaken by attempting to predict what a jury (whether the jury at trial or some hypothetical future jury) would or might do. Rather, in applying the proviso, the task is to decide whether a ""substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"". ""

124Weiss identified three fundamental propositions:

""39 Three fundamental propositions must not be obscured. First, the appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. Secondly, the task of the appellate court is an objective task not materially different from other appellate tasks. It is to be performed with whatever are the advantages and disadvantages of deciding an appeal on the record of the trial; it is not an exercise in speculation or prediction. Thirdly, the standard of proof of criminal guilt is beyond reasonable doubt.""

125When taking into account those three fundamental propositions, Weiss provided the following guidance.

""40 Reference to inevitability of result (or the converse references to ""fair"" or ""real chance of acquittal"") are useful as emphasising the high standard of proof of criminal guilt. They are also useful if they are taken as pointing to ""the 'natural limitations' that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record"". But reference to a jury (whether the trial jury or a hypothetical reasonable jury) is liable to distract attention from the statutory task as expressed by criminal appeal statutes, in this case, s 568(1) of the Crimes Act. It suggests that the appeal court is to do other than decide for itself whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

41 That task is to be undertaken in the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the ""natural limitations"" that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty. There will be cases, perhaps many cases, where those natural limitations require the appellate court to conclude that it cannot reach the necessary degree of satisfaction. In such a case the proviso would not apply, and apart from some exceptional cases, where a verdict of acquittal might be entered, it would be necessary to order a new trial. But recognising that there will be cases where the proviso does not apply does not exonerate the appellate court from examining the record for itself.

...

43 There are, however, some matters to which particular attention should be drawn. First, the appellate court's task must be undertaken on the whole of the record of the trial including the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict. The court is not ""to speculate upon probable reconviction and decide according to how the speculation comes out"". But there are cases in which it would be possible to conclude that the error made at trial would, or at least should, have had no significance in determining the verdict that was returned by the trial jury. The fact that the jury did return a guilty verdict cannot be discarded from the appellate court's assessment of the whole record of trial. Secondly, it is necessary always to keep two matters at the forefront of consideration: the accusatorial character of criminal trials such as the present and that the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt.

44 Next, the permissive language of the proviso (""the Court ... may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal ..."") is important. So, too, is the way in which the condition for the exercise of that power is expressed (""if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred""). No single universally applicable description of what constitutes ""no substantial miscarriage of justice"" can be given. But one negative proposition may safely be offered. It cannot be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty.""

126On a review of all of the facts in this case, and applying those principles, the contested factual issues were relatively narrow. There was the issue of the identity of the person who shot the deceased and whether the evidence established that the shooting occurred during or immediately after the armed robbery. The evidence was overwhelmingly to the effect that the appellant was the person who shot the deceased. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence satisfies the statutory requirement of s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act in that the shooting did take place immediately after the armed robbery. I have reached that decision keeping in mind that the task is an objective one, that there are limitations on a review of the facts based on documentary material and that the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt.

127I appreciate that a decision as to whether the shooting occurred ""immediately after"" the armed robbery involves a judgment on a matter of degree. There was, however, substantial unanimity on the part of the eyewitnesses as to what they saw. What is decisive in this case is that the shooting occurred within 1 - 3 minutes of the armed robbery having taken place. It occurred in close proximity to the robbery, i.e. approximately 30 metres away and was part of the immediate aftermath of that event. The actions of the deceased clearly involved an attempt to detain or apprehend the appellant while he was making his escape from the scene of the armed robbery with the proceeds of that robbery. There was a direct relationship between that event and the armed robbery. Based on the whole of the evidence in this case the shooting and the armed robbery were so closely linked in point of time, place and circumstance that it could scarcely be doubted that the one occurred immediately after the other.

128It follows that although this ground of appeal has been made out, no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred and this ground of appeal should be dismissed.

Ground 3: The verdict of the jury on the charge of murder is unreasonable having regard to the evidence on that charge: s6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)

129No written submissions were addressed to this Ground of Appeal nor was the ground expressly addressed in oral submissions. The effect of the ground of appeal is that the evidence did not, as distinct from could not (Ground of Appeal 1), establish a breach of s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. For the reasons set out when applying the proviso to Ground of Appeal 2, this ground of appeal has not been made out and should be dismissed.

APPELLANT'S ADDITIONAL CONVICTION GROUNDS OF APPEAL
Ground 1: His Honour erred in admitting that portion of the evidence of Messrs Kerr and Cole insofar as it relates to their stated observations of:

(a) The appellant shooting the victim;
(b) The appellant holding a gun prior to the shooting of the victim.
(c) The appellant wrestling with the victim prior to the shooting.

130In support of this Ground of Appeal, the appellant sought the leave of the Court to rely upon ""fresh"" evidence in the form of a ""cleaned up"" DVD, which purported to be a copy of Exhibit J in the trial. Exhibit J comprised approximately four minutes of video from a surveillance camera positioned inside the delicatessen. The ""cleaning up"" of the DVD apparently involved an attempt to depict more clearly what had occurred outside the window of the shop. The end result does not show any detail of persons depicted, but rather they appear in profile. In addition, it is very difficult to relate the images depicted on the ""cleaned up"" DVD to those shown on Exhibit J. No evidence was called, either orally or by way of affidavit, to prove in what respects the DVD had been altered, what was sought to be achieved by the alteration and why such alterations could not have been made before trial. A further difficulty is that the ""cleaned up"" DVD appeared to be different in significant respects to Exhibit J.

131The tender of the ""cleaned up"" DVD should be rejected. It provides less assistance as to what was happening both inside and outside the shop then Exhibit J. More importantly, all of the evidence relating to video material in the trial was based on Exhibit J and it is simply impossible to relate that evidence to the ""cleaned up"" video. The probative value of the ""cleaned up"" DVD in the absence of further evidence is problematic at best. As a result, even if it were admitted it would have no effect on the outcome of the appeal.

132Accordingly, I propose to assess the appellant's submissions in relation to this ground of appeal by reference to Exhibit J not the ""cleaned up"" DVD.

133In order to understand the submissions prepared by the appellant, it is necessary to say something about what is shown on Exhibit J. It is only the first twenty seconds of the video which are relevant to the submissions. The first few seconds of the video are jerky and seem to depict events at an accelerated rate of movement. The video camera appears to be positioned at the rear of the shop and covers the cash register and service counter primarily but also picks up the door to the delicatessen. It incidentally picks up the window of the delicatessen in such a way that movement on the footpath outside the window can be seen but not clearly and not in any detail.

134In the early seconds, Messrs Cole and Kerr can be seen at the door of the delicatessen when something occurs which drew their attention to the footpath outside the shop. The nature of that event cannot be determined from the video. It is possible that what caught their attention was the firing of the shot because both men quickly move from the doorway back into the shop. There is no indication as to the timing of any of these events. 

135The effect of the submissions in support of this ground of appeal is that, by reference to the timing when various events took place during the first twenty seconds of the video, Messrs Cole and Kerr could not have seen the events in relation to which they gave evidence and in particular, have seen the appellant shoot the victim. An important part of the appellant's submissions was that Mr Hines could be identified in the video at the 10 second mark as coming to the aid of Mr Haedo. Since it was common ground that the shot had been fired before Mr Haedo had even reached the appellant, and well before Mr Hines emerged from the Retravision shop, the evidence of Messrs Cole and Kerr must be incorrect.

Consideration

136The difficulty with this and the significant number of related submissions is that they are based on a false premise. It is simply not possible from the video to identify with any degree of precision what is happening outside the window of the delicatessen. Firstly, the area of footpath outside the window picked up by the camera is restricted and because of the position of the camera, somewhat distorted. It is not possible to identify what actions are taking place and who is moving outside the window. It is not possible to determine precisely where Messrs Cole and Kerr are looking at any point in time. What is clear from the video is that both of them were ideally positioned to see what was happening outside the delicatessen at the relevant time.

137The submissions in support of this ground are based on assumptions which are not established. Those assumptions include the identity of persons outside the window of the shop, what those persons are doing, and what Messrs Cole and Kerr could see at any point in time. The simple fact is that Exhibit J does not support the submissions made.

138This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 2: The Court erred in admitting evidence of the gunshot residue as evidence of the appellant having used the gun to murder the victim.

139Senior Constable Steel arranged for plastic bags to be placed over the appellant's hands when he was taken to the hospital for treatment. Detective Senior Constable Forsyth arranged for the plastic bags on the appellant's hands to be replaced with paper bags and took possession of the plastic bags. Detective Senior Constable Heaney observed the paper bags being removed from the appellant's hands and gunshot residue swabs being applied. Ms Hales, scientific officer, gave evidence as to the extent of the gunshot residue which was detected on the appellant's hands and from the paper bag which had been placed over his right hand.

140This evidence was clearly relevant to the issue of whether or not the appellant had been holding the pistol when it discharged. The evidence was therefore admissible. It is true that the appellant offered an alternative explanation for how gunshot residue came to be on his hand. He said that this occurred when he took the pistol away from the gunman. That factual dispute, however, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Accordingly, this ground of appeal has not been made out.

ADDITIONAL GROUNDS

141Although this is not reflected in the additional Conviction Grounds of Appeal, included in the appellant's written submissions are 10 pages of submissions entitled ""Additional Grounds"". Those submissions identified particular pieces of evidence given primarily by the bystander witnesses and sought to identify inconsistencies. It was then submitted that these inconsistencies rendered the evidence unreliable. These issues were fully ventilated by the appellant's counsel at trial, who identified and put to the jury a number of such inconsistencies. There is a large element of repetition in the inconsistencies identified in the ""additional grounds"".

142The acceptance or otherwise of the evidence of the bystander witnesses was a matter for the jury. There are no matters identified in the ""Additional Grounds"" which are of such significance, either individually or in combination, as would cause this Court to set aside the jury verdict on the ground that it was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. On the contrary, the matters identified are of peripheral importance and marginal relevance. 

143The identification evidence to the effect that the appellant was the person who shot the deceased is overwhelming. None of the eyewitnesses saw the fourth person asserted by the appellant to have been the gunman. None of the eyewitnesses supported the appellant's evidence that having disarmed the gunman he was holding the pistol by the barrel. They were unanimous in their evidence that the person struggling was holding the pistol by the handle. The only disagreement between the eyewitnesses was whether he was holding the pistol in his right hand. Most said he was, whereas others were not sure.

THE SENTENCE APPEAL

Ground 1: The learned sentencing judge erred in finding that:

(a) This was a cold blooded shooting effected in an attempt to avoid apprehension and
(b) That the concept of ""self defence"" had no application

Ground 2: The sentence imposed in respect of Count 1 was manifestly excessive.

Ground 2A: The total sentence is excessive in the light of the applicant's medical condition.

Ground 2B: Fresh evidence.

Ground 3: The learned sentencing judge failed to apply the principles of totality.

Ground 4: The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances.

144As a preliminary issue, the appellant sought leave to rely upon Grounds of Appeal 2A and 2B. The fresh evidence comprised a medical report, plus x-ray reports, concerning the health of the appellant. The effect of these reports was that the appellant was diagnosed with lung cancer in October 2012. A CT scan carried out in January 2013 showed that the cancer was of a particularly aggressive kind, so that doctors at the Prince of Wales Hospital discontinued chemotherapy treatment. He is currently in the palliative care unit of the Long Bay Prison Hospital. His life expectancy was described as ""short to medium term"" in January 2013. That assessment has not been further defined.

145The Crown opposed the admission of this material as fresh evidence on the basis that it was not sufficiently specific as to the nature of the appellant's condition and his life expectancy.

146The Court determined that the material did constitute ""fresh"" evidence and should be admitted. It was evidence that was not available at the time when the appellant was sentenced and it was capable of having a significant effect on his sentence appeal (R v Bailey (1988) 35 A Crim R 458; R v Ehrenberg (NSWCCA, unreported 14 December 1990). On the basis of the admissibility of the fresh evidence, the Court allowed the appellant to amend his Grounds of Appeal to rely upon Grounds 2A and 2B.

Ground 1: His Honour erred in finding that (a) this was a cold-blooded shooting effected in an attempt to avoid apprehension and (b) that the concept of ""self-defence"" had no application.

147The appellant relied upon the matters which had been raised in relation to the ""nexus part"" of Ground of Appeal 1. He submitted that the shooting occurred in a context where the deceased was armed with a machete and had the appellant in a potentially life-threatening situation and that the shooting occurred as a direct response to the then extreme, excessive and unreasonable actions of the deceased.

148The appellant submitted that in those circumstances, it was not open to the sentencing judge to find that the case involved ""a cold-blooded shooting effected in an attempt to avoid apprehension"" or that the concept of ""self-defence"" had no application.

Consideration

149His Honour's finding as to how the shooting occurred was:

""Essentially what Peter Cole described is that he saw Mr Rawas seize Hudd, Mr Rawas then held the machete he was holding to Hudd's neck. Somehow Hudd managed to spin away from Mr Rawas and put his hand inside the bag slung on his body, pull out the revolver and shot Mr Rawas at point blank range in the stomach. While Mr Cole deposed that shortly after a second shot was fired by Hudd to Mr Rawas' body the reality is that the second shot which was fired was fired upwards passing through the awning over the footpath."" (ROS 7)

""Dr Gumbert, on Hudd's behalf, made a number of submissions in mitigation. These included: (a) That I not accept Mr Cole's version of events. With the qualification that I mentioned above, I do; (b) that the shooting of Mr Rawas occurred in the agony of the moment. Accepting as I do Mr Cole's testimony I find that this was a cold-blooded shooting effected in an attempt to avoid apprehension; (c) While self-defence was not an available concept in the circumstances of this murder the reality was that Hudd was being attacked by a man armed with a machete at the critical time. Accordingly, as the submission goes, this is a relevant factor which should on sentence lead to diminution of the period I would otherwise impose.

It is true, as I have found, that Mr Rawas pursued Hudd and had armed himself with a machete. However, Mr Rawas knew that Hudd was armed with a revolver and, indeed, had fired during the course of the robbery.

If the concept of the self-defence had any application here it would have arisen if Mr Rawas had wounded or killed Hudd during the confrontation not the reverse."" (ROS 13-14)

150I do not understand the sentencing judge to have used the term ""cold-blooded"" as involving some kind of premeditation. What his Honour was clearly focusing on was the evidence of Messrs Kerr and Cole to the effect that the appellant freed himself in some way from the deceased's grasp so that they were standing approximately a metre apart and then deliberately removed the pistol from his bag and shot the deceased.

151Having freed himself from the deceased's grasp, the appellant appears to have done nothing to escape, but to have deliberately accessed the pistol and fired it, not to wound or threaten the deceased, but into the stomach. In that sense, it was well open to his Honour to characterise such a deliberate action as ""cold-blooded"".

152His Honour was also entitled to reject the suggestion that the appellant's sentence should be mitigated because in discharging the firearm, he was acting in self-defence. At the time he fired the fatal shot, he was separated by approximately a metre from the deceased and there was no evidence that the deceased at that time was making any move towards him. Moreover, as already indicated, the entire self-defence scenario is placed in considerable doubt by the absence of any machete wounds suffered by the appellant to any part of his body except his index fingers.

153Since the only evidence as to the circumstances in which the deceased was shot came from Messrs Kerr and Cole, their evidence must have been accepted by the jury thereby entitling his Honour to make the findings which he did. This ground of appeal should be dismissed.

Ground 2: The sentence imposed in respect of Count 1 was manifestly excessive.

Ground 2A: The total sentence is excessive in the light of the applicant's medical condition.

Ground 2B: Fresh evidence.

154These grounds of appeal can be conveniently dealt with together. The fresh evidence ground relates to the appellant's health and has already been dealt with.

155The appellant submitted that he was aged 67 years and 3 months at the time of sentencing. He would be almost 87 years of age when eligible for parole. The appellant submitted that this was a factor which the sentencing judge should have taken into account and it was an error for him not to do so.

156The appellant referred to R v Hunter (1984) 36 SASR 101 at 103 where King CJ, when dealing with the question of sentence for a 74 year old person convicted of fraud, said:

""The difficult aspect of the respondent's case is his age. A sentencing judge cannot overlook the fact that each year of the sentence represents a substantial proportion of the period of life which is left to him. It may be that when that consideration is borne in mind, it can be said that the sentence of five years' imprisonment, which at first sight seems very lenient for the respondent's criminal conduct, is nevertheless within the scope of the judge's sentencing discretion.""

157In the same case, Jacobs J at 106 said:

""What is there, then, to take this case out of the ordinary range? It can only be the age of the respondent, who is now seventy-four years old. To impose a head sentence of the magnitude which the crimes deserve would thus be tantamount to a sentence of life imprisonment, and that would clearly be inappropriate. Such a sentence is reserved for the most heinous felonies. Recognising that, the learned sentencing judge felt unable to go beyond a head sentence of more than five years, and I am quite unable to say that he erred in fixing so short a period.""

158Malcolm CJ in R v Austin (1996) 87 A Crim 570 at 572, citing an earlier decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia in Smith, said:

""The significance of old age as a mitigating factor, particularly when combined with ill health, is that it constitutes a basis on which the Court in the exercise of mercy, may impose a sentence significantly shorter than otherwise might be the case.""

159In relation to his health, the appellant submitted that it was clear that he suffered from terminal cancer and that he had only a short time to live. In those circumstances, the appellant submitted that he should be released forthwith so that he can die in the presence of his family outside of prison. The appellant submitted that even in a palliative care environment, the impact of serving a prison sentence will make his final months of life more difficult that if he were to be released.

160The Court was referred to a decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in R v Leith [2000] 1 Qd R 660 where Shepherdson J (with whom de Jersey CJ and Cullinane J agreed) said in relation to a drug trafficker who had been sentenced to imprisonment for 9 months, but who after sentencing, had been diagnosed with terminal cancer:

""In my opinion the circumstances of the present case are very unusual and are such that if the sentence remained in place the applicant, whose health is in a very parlous state, might well die in custody. Such a result would be draconian, tragic and inhumane.

If both applications before this Court were refused, it appears likely the applicant would effectively be obliged to spend his last days in custody and be deprived of the society and comfort of his wife and children. It appears that the applicant's illness has ended an estrangement he had with his wife. He would be obliged to recover from treatment while in a prison hospital situation.

In my view, given the very unusual circumstances of this case it would be a miscarriage of justice if this extension of time were not granted and the sentence not varied to permit the applicant to be released immediately from custody.""

Consideration

161The only reference to the appellant's age made by his Honour was:

""In terms of the future, the reality is Hudd has no real prospects of rehabilitation. As I said, he is now 67, and the duration of any sentence I pass must, of necessity, exceed his present life expectancy on the mortality table. Indeed, and this is an extraordinary case, there is no subjective factors which are in any way favourable to Hudd, other than perhaps his age.

As the Crown rightly submits, this is a case where the remarks of the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477 are applicable:

""The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind.""""

162The issue of the age of an offender was considered by Giles JA (with whom Howie and Latham JJ agreed) in Barton v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 164:

""In Goebel-McGregor v R [2006] NSWCCA 390 the applicant was found guilty of murder, and was sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period 15 years and a total term of 20 years. The sentence commenced when the applicant was aged 62. James J, with whom Hidden and Hislop JJ agreed, recorded at [126] the submission that the sentencing judge ""having decided that the offence did not call for a life sentence, had imposed a sentence which, having regard to the prisoner's age and life expectancy, was tantamount to a life sentence"". His Honour said of this -

""128 As regards the further submission made by counsel for the appellant, it is true that this Court has said that, if a life sentence is to be imposed, it should be imposed ""frankly and directly"" and a sentencing court which refrains from imposing a life sentence should not impose a determinate sentence which would have the effect of a life sentence. R v Chen (2003) 138 A Crim R 433 at 444 (67). However, a sentence must reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and when the offender is of advanced years a determinate sentence, in order to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, may unavoidably extend for all or most of the offender's life expectancy. In Des Rosiers v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 16 Latham J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, referred with approval at par 30 of her judgment to a statement by Allen J in R v Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502 at 507:

'It simply is not the law that it can never be appropriate to impose a minimum term which will have the effect, because of the advanced age of the offender, that he well may spend the whole of his remaining life in custody'.

129 In the present case the appellant was sixty-two years old at the time he committed the offence of murder by what the sentencing judge found to be a cowardly and brutal act. It was inevitable that there would be a real risk of the appellant dying in custody, before he completed serving even the non-parole period of any sentence which adequately reflected the objective seriousness of the offence. The age of the offender means that a custodial sentence appropriate in all the circumstances for the murder of the deceased will be likely to see him in custody at the end of his life. There is no certainty of that but the actuarial probabilities and common experience suggests that it is so. I am bound to take that fact into account, but not in a way that derogates on the obligation of the sentencing judge to impose a sentence that adequately reflects the objective seriousness of the offence. The advanced age of the offender is a matter I take into account when determining whether to reduce the standard non-parole period of 20 years and whether or not to vary the statutory ratio of the non-parole and parole period.""

163There is some force in the Crown's complaint that the information provided concerning the appellant's health is of a general kind. I agree. Nevertheless, the report of Dr Badami from JusticeHealth refers to the presence of a metastatic lung sarcoma which in this case is of such lethality that the appellant's treating doctors ceased chemotherapy. In those circumstances, I accept that the appellant's health condition is parlous and is life expectancy is certainly less than 12 months.

164The submissions relating to the appellant's health raise in effect similar issues to those which arise when taking into account a long sentence for an offender of advanced years. In such cases, one would not be human if one did not feel some sympathy for the position of an offender who finds himself or herself in such circumstances. That having been said, the Court is still obliged to approach such situations in a principled fashion.

165As his Honour found, all of these offences but in particular the murder offence, were objectively serious. His Honour assessed it as falling just short of being within the category of the worst type of case. It is clear why his Honour reached that conclusion. The actual shooting, as I have indicated, was deliberate and not compelled by circumstances. To that extent, there was a certain cold-blooded detachment on the part of the appellant in the commission of the crime. 

166The offence of murder carried a standard non-parole period of 20 years. His Honour imposed a non-parole period of 20 years and 3 months. Given his Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, the sentence in fact imposed was lenient in the circumstances. The circumstances of this case, and the very serious nature of the offending, are quite different to the circumstances considered by the Court in R v Leith. Accordingly, despite the fresh evidence and the appellant's age, it would not be a proper exercise of the court's sentencing discretion to reduce the sentence for the murder offence.

Ground 3: The learned sentencing judge failed to apply the principles of totality.

167No oral submissions were addressed to this ground and the written submissions were restricted to an assertion that the effective head sentence of 28 ½ years was manifestly excessive, thereby demonstrating that the principle of totality had been breached. 

Consideration

168His Honour followed what he was required to do by Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 by first determining the appropriate sentence for each offence and then considering the issues of accumulation or concurrency, as well as questions of totality. Whether or not to accumulate sentences imposed in relation to multiple offences is essentially an exercise of discretion made in accordance with established principle. In R v Hammond (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 Simpson J said:

""There will be many cases in which sentencing judges might take differing view but neither view would be said to be wrong.""

169It is evident that his Honour gave considerable thought to the application of the principle of totality when he structured the sentences. He specifically referred to Pearce and the principle of totality. In considering the total sentence passed, one needs to keep in mind that his Honour was sentencing for a serious murder offence, for two pre-meditated armed robberies in company, each of which was accompanied by violence, for a malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm and for an assault in company occasioning actual bodily harm. Neither the overall head sentence nor the overall non-parole period can reasonably be regarded as appellably excessive or as failing to take into account the principle of totality.

Ground 4: His Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances.

170The appellant submitted that because of the appellant's age and the accumulation of sentences, a finding of special circumstances was warranted and his Honour erred in not varying the statutory ratio.

Consideration

171It is clear from his Honour's remarks on sentence that he was requested to make a finding of special circumstances but declined to do so. The principles applicable to setting a non-parole of a sentence under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 were conveniently summarised by RA Hulme J in Caristo v R [2011] NSW CCA 7 at [28]:

""28 A finding of special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact in respect of which this Court will be slow to intervene: Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 at [83]. 


29 ""As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive"": R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [19]; R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [36]. 


30 Simply because there are circumstances which are capable of constituting special circumstances, the court is not required to make such a finding and reduce the non-parole period: R v Fidow, above, at [22]. 


31 The degree or extent of any adjustment of the ""statutory ratio"" is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge: R v Cramp, [2004] NSWCCA 264, at [31]; Trad v R [2009] NSWCCA 56 at [33].""

172In the present case his Honour set out the relevant principles, considered their application, exposed his reasons and partially accumulated the sentences. He was aware of and specifically noted that the consequence of the sentences imposed would likely see the applicant die in gaol, but found that such a sentence was the only one that he could impose given the objective seriousness of the offences. There was no miscalculation, mistake or inadvertence involved. No error in his Honour's approach or in his exercise of discretion has been demonstrated. This ground of appeal should be dismissed.

CONCLUSION

173The orders which I propose are as follows:

(1) Grant leave to appeal in relation to the factual issues in the conviction appeal and in respect of the sentence appeal.

(2) Dismiss the appeal.

174During the course of the appeal, Senior Counsel for the appellant advised the Court that an application had been made to the Government for clemency in this matter given the serious nature of the appellant's illness. For the reasons set out above, the application of established principle required that the appellant's application for leave to appeal against sentence be dismissed. That having been said, I wish to record the support of the Court for the appellant's application for clemency.

175ADAMS J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Hoeben JA. I respectfully agree with his Honour's reasoning and conclusions as to all grounds of appeal except Grounds 2 and 3 in respect of the conviction, as argued by counsel on the appellant's behalf. I agree that the trial judge erred in removing from the jury's consideration the question whether the shooting of Mr Rawas occurred immediately after the foundational crime, namely armed robbery and, hence, that the crucial question arises as to the application of the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It is not necessary for me to set out again the relevant authorities, which have helpfully been cited by Hoeben JA. However, it is perhaps worth noting that the observation in Weiss v R [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [43] that ""the appellate court's task must be undertaken on the whole of the record of the trial including the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict"" can scarcely apply where that verdict has been given in obedience to a direction as to how a matter of fact encompassing an element of the offence must be decided, thus removing from the jury its constitutional role in deciding that question. 

176Here, the critical question is whether the prosecution had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had shot Mr Rawas ""immediately after"" the armed robbery. On any account, the robbery was well and truly over at the time. There was link between that offence and the shooting, beyond question, in the sense that Mr Rawas had escaped from his bonds and pursued the man he believed (on good grounds) to be one of the robbers. For present purposes it matters not why he did so. As all witnesses attest, Mr Rawas attacked the appellant. He was shot a very short time after the first physical connection between them, some 30 metres or so from the shop. Was the temporal connection between the robbery and the shooting ""immediately after"" the robbery? 

177It is, to my mind, imperative to bear in mind that, as a matter of principle, we are dealing here with an action which otherwise might well not be murder. The only requirement, so far as the act of an offender is concerned, is that death result from an intentional act, even if there was no intention to injure in any way or, indeed, even if no reasonable person would have foreseen that injury might result. The need to interpret the requirements of the section strictly is evident. I do not mean that the word ""immediately"" is not to be given its ordinary meaning but no moment past the immediate will qualify. Furthermore, the context is incapable of expanding or varying its connotation. The mere fact that there is a link between the robbery and the killing says nothing whatever about the temporal requirement. That must be determined objectively as a separate and independent question though, of course, in the factual context of what occurred. 

178The term ""immediately after"" is one of ordinary English usage. No doubt it is not susceptible of mathematical precision. To my mind, it carries the sense of something happening without any delay or lapse of time, straightaway or (to adapt the language of the trial judge in Attard (NSWCCA unreported, 20 April 1993) ""forthwith"". The appellant's killing of Mr Rawas certainly was not the next thing to occur after the robbery - that was the offenders leaving the premises and moving some 30 metres down the road and the next event was the physical grappling between the appellant and Mr Rawas, after which the shooting occurred. In short, there was a sequence of identifiable, separate events following the robbery, of which the shooting of the deceased was the last. I am unable to agree, with respect, that the shooting occurred ""immediately after"" the robbery as required by the section. 

179At all events, the requirement of immediacy was an element of the offence which it was entirely within the province of the jury to determine. The impugned direction that substituted the trial judge's opinion was not a denial of procedural fairness (see Weiss, supra, at [45]). Neither Hoeben JA nor Beech-Jones J consider that the error was sufficiently fundamental to render the proviso inapplicable. With respect, I am unable to agree with this conclusion. The appellant was entitled, indeed as was the community, to have the jury consider and determine whether the prosecution had proved each element of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. This requirement was not met that one such element was decided, instead, by the trial judge. For that reason alone I would not apply the proviso to the error. 

180Upholding this ground of appeal would have the consequence that the conviction of the appellant for murder would be quashed and a new trial ordered. However, it follows from my view of the evidence as to immediacy that I would also uphold Ground 3. This would have the consequence of requiring a verdict of acquittal to be entered.

181BEECH-JONES J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Hoeben JA. I agree with those reasons. I add the following in relation to ground 2. 

182For the reasons given by Hoeben JA it was erroneous of the trial judge to remove from the jury's consideration the determination of the issue posed by s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 as to whether the killing of the deceased took place ""during or immediately"" after the commission of the robbery of the store in Matraville. This conclusion gives rise to the need to consider the application of the ""proviso"" in sub-section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, namely whether this Court should dismiss the appeal because ""it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.""

183The appellant contended that the failure of the trial judge to leave this issue to the jury represents a form of error that does not attract the proviso. The proposition that certain classes of error can preclude the proviso's application derives support from the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Quartermaine v The Queen [1980] HCA 29; 143 CLR 595 at 600 to 601 and the judgments in Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 372 -373 (per Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ), at 375 (per Deane J) and at 381 - 382 (per Gaudron J). Whether such a form of error exists was left open by the unanimous judgment in Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300 at [46]. However in Gassy v The Queen [2008] HCA 18; 236 CLR 293 at [33] Gummow and Hayne JJ stated that the majority judgement of Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ in Wilde is ""not to be understood as prescribing or defining a class of cases to which the proviso cannot be applied"" but was instead identifying a category of case in which an ""appellate court could not conclude that there had been no substantial miscarriage of justice"". In Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 27; 235 CLR 521 at [42] their Honours described the proper approach as being the ""graver the departure from the requirements of a fair trial, the harder it is for an appellate court to conclude that guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt"" for the purpose of applying the proviso (see also Cooper v The Queen [2012] HCA 50; 87 ALJR 32 at [53] per Heydon J; cf Conway v The Queen [2002] HCA 2; 209 CLR 203 at [103] per Kirby J).

184Assuming that I am bound by Wilde to hold that there is a class of error or irregularity that precludes the operation of the proviso because the ""trial was so irregular that no proper trial has taken place"" (Quartermaine at 601), this was not such a case. As noted by Hoeben JA at [122] an erroneous direction to the jury does not per se preclude any application of the proviso. Subsection 6(1) itself makes that clear. It might be said that the error was potentially more serious than a mere erroneous direction as its effect was that the jury were not asked to deliberate on a matter that constituted an element of the crime. However, while that matter may make it harder for the Crown to satisfy the proviso, the Court was not referred to any authority suggesting that it amounted to the sort of extreme or fundamental error that might, on a view of Quartermaine or Wilde, preclude the proviso's application. Certainly it did not equate to the sort of irregularities that occurred in Wilde which the majority in that case held were answered by the application of the proviso (at 373 to 375). 

185In Weiss at [43] the High Court stated that the jury's guilty verdict ""cannot be discarded from the appellate court's assessment of the whole record of trial"". In this case it is clear that the jury rejected the appellant's version of events which was completely inconsistent with the evidence from the various eye witnesses. This aspect of their assessment was unaffected by any failure of the trial judge to direct them as to the need for the killing to take place during or immediately after the robbery. The evidence of the eye witnesses is summarised in the judgment of Hoeben JA at [18] to [53]. Allowing for understandable differences in their recall of a traumatic event, in my view it follows inexorably from the evidence of those witnesses that the killing of the victim occurred ""immediately after"" the commission of the felony by the appellant. In this case the evidence that was ""admitted at [the] trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the [appellant's] guilt"" on the charge of murder (Weiss as [44]). I am satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred. I am also satisfied that there is no reason not to dismiss the appeal (Weiss at [45]). 

186I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben JA.

2761137,Semaan v Poidevin [2013] NSWSC 226,"Judgment

1A woman walks into a bar. She is a police officer, but she is not in uniform. She walks up to the bar and asks another, whose face the officer recognises, for some ecstasy tablets. The bar attendant, overhearing the conversation, and incensed, says: 

""I will not have drug deals in my bar. Both of you get out and stay out."" 

The officer was in the process of a ""sting"" (a controlled operation), the aim of which was the arrest of the drug dealer. The officer was acting in the execution of her duty. Is the bar attendant guilty of the offence of hindering a police officer in execution of her duty? Does it make a difference if the officer were in uniform? On one view of High Court authority, the attendant would be guilty and knowledge that the person is a police officer is irrelevant (R v Reynhoudt [1962] HCA 23; (1962) 107 CLR 381).

2In this appeal against conviction in the Local Court, Mr Semaan, the appellant, who was not under arrest at the time, was told to hand over his mobile phone to a police officer. He refused. The officer grabbed for it and Mr Semaan resisted. He was found guilty of resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty, because the officer was, it was found, so acting.

3The officer was fearful that Mr Semaan would call friends, who would arrive at the scene and breach public peace. There is no finding that Mr Semaan was ever relevantly speaking on his phone or sending a text at the time. Mr Semaan was not, at the relevant time, told of the officer's fear or the facts upon which the State of NSW now relies (and in the Local Court relied) to support the conviction. 

4The issues in the appeal and in the opening hypothetical are the same. The State of New South Wales, relying on High Court authority (R v Reynhoudt, supra) submits that knowledge of the status of the ""victim"" as a police officer or that the conduct is in execution of duties is unnecessary for a conviction under s 546C of the Crimes Act 1900, for hindering or resisting a police officer in the execution of his or her duty. Further, the State of NSW submits that the officer was acting lawfully in the execution of his duty.

5Robert Semaan appeals his conviction by the Local Court on 4 April 2012 for resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty in contravention of s 546C of the Crimes Act. Mr Semaan seeks that the conviction be set aside, and other ancillary orders.

Nature of the appeal

6Mr Semaan appeals pursuant to the provisions of s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, which provides for an appeal as of right to the Court from a conviction or sentence ""but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone"".

7In different contexts the phrase ""a question of law"" will have different meanings or results and the phrase ""a question of law alone"" will involve different restrictions: Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v X [2000] NSWCA 199; (2000) 49 NSWLR 653; Kostas v HIA Insurance Services Pty Ltd [2010] HCA 32; (2010) 241 CLR 390; Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36; (1996) 186 CLR 389; Krishna v DPP (NSW) [2007] NSWCCA 318.

8Notwithstanding the slightly different context, I adopt the view of ""question of law alone"" that I took in Krishna, supra, (with which view Basten JA and Latham J agreed) and otherwise adopt the taxonomy in Collector of Customs v Pressure Tankers Pty Ltd and Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 322; (1993) 43 FCR 280 (cited with approval in Agfa-Gevaert, supra) and Australian Gaslight Co v Valuer-General (1940) 40 SR (NSW) 126. 

Facts

9The judgment below, delivered ex tempore, summarised the evidence and came to conclusions of fact (Transcript, 4 April 2012, p 36, line 40 - p 37, line 4 and p 37, line 10 - p 38, line 34). 

10The submissions filed on behalf of Mr Semaan summarised the facts relatively uncontentiously. 

11On 14 September 2011, police were contacted in relation to a domestic incident at a property at Queens Street, Auburn. Next door to the unit complex was another unit complex in Marion Street, Auburn. 

12The unit complex at Marion Street comprises inclosed lands for the purpose of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901. 

13One of the officers in attendance, Constable Lim, after being told certain things, went to the property next door in Marion Street. He could hear voices and he saw four males. He and his companions, Constable Singh and Senior Constable Hockey, went to the premises next door. Two of the observed males left to the rear of the unit block and a third male went to the front of the unit block with Mr Semaan (who was the fourth of the males observed).

14Constables Singh and Lim pursued the third male out of the unit block and back on to the street. 

15Leading Senior Constable Ward, a fourth police officer, went to the rear of the subject premises, where he found a ""bong"", which was warm and appeared to have been recently used. There was cannabis residue in the bowl. The third male was arrested. Later he was released and proceeded against by service of a Court Attendance Notice. Senior Constable Hockey spoke to Mr Semaan and asked him:

""What were you doing in the block of apartments?""

16Senior Constable Hockey also asked Mr Semaan to produce identification, which Mr Semaan did. Senior Constable Ward and Sergeant Poidevin then approached Mr Semaan. 

17Senior Constable Hockey then walked away from the plaintiff and commenced to use the police radio to conduct checks on Mr Semaan. As Senior Constable Hockey walked away, Mr Semaan shouted:

""What the fuck's happening, I want to go home.""

Sergeant Poidevin responded:

""Wait here until we have finished doing our checks, but it looks like at this stage you will be getting done for trespass.""

Mr Semaan responded:

""Oh come on get fucked, we will see about this, you wait and see, you're fucked now.""

18Mr Semaan then reached for his phone and began dialling. Sergeant Poidevin said words to the effect of:

""No mate, get off the phone!""

19Sergeant Poidevin's request or direction to cease using the phone was given while the Sergeant was attempting to reach Mr Semaan's phone. Mr Semaan turned his body in a way that moved the phone away from Sergeant Poidevin and placed his forearm against Sergeant Poidevin's chest.

20Sergeant Poidevin held Mr Semaan's upper body and Mr Semaan resisted Sergeant Poidevin. This resulted in a struggle where both Mr Semaan and Sergeant Poidevin fell to the ground. Mr Semaan was injured and an ambulance was called. Sergeant Poidevin was also injured, but there is no allegation of assault. It seems irrelevant for present purposes, but, as best as can be ascertained from the evidence, Mr Semaan had broken or seriously injured his ankle or leg.

21Mr Semaan continued to struggle and was handcuffed, but the handcuffs were released when he ceased struggling. He was not arrested.

22The learned Magistrate also accepted evidence from Senior Constable Ward to the effect that Sergeant Poidevin requested Mr Semaan twice to get off the phone and also requested Mr Semaan, in relation to the phone, to ""give it to me now"". Senior Constable Ward denied that Mr Semaan was on the phone during the time that Senior Constable Hockey was speaking to him. 

23After the third male was released, the third male used his phone and shortly afterwards five males attended the location. 

24Sergeant Poidevin's evidence was accepted by the learned Magistrate, at least insofar as he told Mr Semaan not to use the phone, as ""based on his experience there was an issue of officer safety"". The learned Magistrate determined that he accepted that evidence and ""it was founded on a proper concern for his and other officers' safety. Police officers have to operate in the real world and Sergeant Poidevin was entitled to rely on his experience to make those judgments.""

25Sergeant Poidevin in his statement (page 74 of the Affidavit of Chaddy Mardini of 30 July 2012) described Mr Semaan as ""agitated and ... shouting profanities ...drug affected"", the terms of which description are remarkably similar to the description by other officers: see for example page 84 at [5].

26The third male did use his phone. Five males described by police as of ""Middle Eastern"" appearance attended. They were told to move on and did. There was, in fact, no breach of the peace. The third male was not, it seems, directed not to use his mobile phone. The relevance of their ethnic appearance is unclear, unless it, quite improperly, formed a criterion on which the reasonable apprehension of the police officer was based.

27The police charged Mr Semaan with two offences:

(i) Enter inclosed lands, contrary to s 4 of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901; and
(ii) Resist police in execution of duty, contrary to s 546C of the Crimes Act 1900. 

28The learned Magistrate dismissed the charge of entering inclosed lands and convicted Mr Semaan for the resist police in execution of duty. 

Submissions and Legislation

29Essentially the submissions of Mr Semaan raise one ground, of which there are a number of particulars. Mr Semaan submits that the action of the attempt to seize Mr Semaan's telephone was unlawful. As a consequence of that unlawfulness, the attempted seizure of the phone was not an action in the execution of the duty of a police officer and, therefore, as a matter of law, the resistance was not to a police officer in the execution of his duty and, also as a matter of law, at least one element of the offence under s 546C of the Crimes Act has not been proved. 

30No serious attempt was made to identify at the outset precisely the question of law, which alone forms the basis of the appeal, but, during the course of submissions, it became clear that the issues between the parties were the lawfulness of the attempt to seize the telephone either pursuant to the terms of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (hereinafter, ""LEPRA"") or otherwise and an error of law by the Magistrate in the determination of the elements of the offence for which Mr Semaan was found guilty. 

31Mr Semaan was not under arrest at the time that police sought to seize his telephone. The learned Magistrate made no finding as to whether Mr Semaan was talking on the phone at the time that the request was made of him to hand over the phone. There is no suggestion that, as a matter of fact, Mr Semaan was dialling persons to come to his assistance. For all we know he could have been telephoning his parents, his lawyer or his wife, partner or girlfriend. Mr Semaan was almost 29 at the time of the incident. He was described as agitated and drug affected.

32The submissions of both Mr Semaan and the Crown Solicitor's Office (representing Sergeant Poidevin) concentrated on the lawfulness of the conduct of Sergeant Poidevin in seizing (or attempting to seize) the telephone. Each party submitted that the question of whether the defendant, Sergeant Poidevin, was acting lawfully would answer the question in the proceedings, being, whether he was acting ""in the execution of his duty"", for the purpose of s 546C of the Crimes Act: see Re K (1993) 46 FCR 336; Williams v DPP [2011] NSWSC 1085.

33It is appropriate to recite the terms of the Crimes Act:

""546C Resisting etc police 
Any person who resists or hinders or incites any person to assault, resist or hinder a police officer in the execution of his or her duty shall be liable on conviction before the Local Court to imprisonment for 12 months or to a fine of 10 penalty units, or both.""

34It is also necessary, in order to understand the submissions of the parties, to recite the terms of s 201 of LEPRA. It is in the following terms:

""201 Supplying police officer's details and giving warnings 
(1) A police officer must provide the person subject to the exercise of a power referred to in subsection (3) with the following: 
(a) evidence that the police officer is a police officer (unless the police officer is in uniform), 
(b) the name of the police officer and his or her place of duty, 
(c) the reason for the exercise of the power. 
(2) A police officer must comply with subsection (1) in relation to a power referred to in subsection (3) (other than subsection (3) (g), (i) or (j)): 
(a) if it is practicable to do so, before or at the time of exercising the power, or 
(b) if it is not practicable to do so before or at that time, as soon as is reasonably practicable after exercising the power. 
(2A) A police officer must comply with subsection (1) in relation to a power referred to in subsection (3) (g), (i) or (j) before exercising the power, except as otherwise provided by subsection (2B). 
(2B) If a police officer is exercising a power to give a direction to a person (as referred to in subsection (3) (i)) by giving the direction to a group of 2 or more persons, the police officer must comply with subsection (1) in relation to the power: 
(a) if it is practicable to do so, before or at the time of exercising the power, or 
(b) if it is not practicable to do so, as soon as is reasonably practicable after exercising the power. 
(2C) If a police officer exercises a power that involves the making of a request or direction that a person is required to comply with by law, the police officer must, as soon as is reasonably practicable after making the request or direction, provide the person the subject of the request or direction with: 
(a) a warning that the person is required by law to comply with the request or direction (unless the person has already complied or is in the process of complying), and 
(b) if the person does not comply with the request or direction after being given that warning, and the police officer believes that the failure to comply by the person is an offence, a warning that the failure to comply with the request or direction is an offence. 
(2D) In addition, if a police officer exercises a power that involves the making of a direction under section 198 on the grounds that a person is intoxicated and disorderly in a public place, the police officer must provide the person the subject of the direction with a warning that it is an offence to be intoxicated and disorderly in that or any other public place at any time within 6 hours after the direction is given. 
Note: See section 9 of the Summary Offences Act 1988 . 
(3) This section applies to the exercise of the following powers (whether or not conferred by or under this Act): 
(a) a power to search or arrest a person, 
(b) a power to search a vehicle, vessel or aircraft, 
(c) a power to enter premises (not being a public place), 
(d) a power to search premises (not being a public place), 
(e) a power to seize any property, 
(f) a power to stop or detain a person (other than a power to detain a person under Part 16) or a vehicle, vessel or aircraft, 
(g) a power to request a person to disclose his or her identity or the identity of another person (including a power to require the removal of a face covering for identification purposes), 
(h) a power to establish a crime scene at premises (not being a public place), 
(i) a power to give a direction to a person, 
(j) a power under section 21A to request a person to open his or her mouth or shake or move his or her hair, 
(k) a power under section 26 to request a person to submit to a frisk search or to produce a dangerous implement or metallic object. 
(3AA) Despite subsection (3), this section does not apply to the exercise of a power to enter premises or to search premises or a vehicle, vessel or aircraft that is conferred by a covert search warrant. 
(3A) If a police officer is exercising more than one power to which this section applies on a single occasion, and in relation to the same person, the police officer is required to comply with subsection (1) (a) and (b) in relation to that person only once on that occasion. 
(4) If 2 or more police officers are exercising a power to which this section applies, only one officer present is required to comply with this section. 
(5) However, if a person asks another police officer present for information as to the name of the police officer and his or her place of duty, the police officer must give to the person the information requested. 
(6) This section does not apply to the exercise of a power that is conferred by an Act or regulation specified in Schedule 1. 
Note: See section 5 (1), which provides that this Act does not limit the functions of a police officer under an Act or regulation specified in Schedule 1.""

35In seizing the phone or attempting so to do, Sergeant Poidevin was exercising the power to which s 201(3)(e) of LEPRA refers. 

36The defendant submits that the provisions of s 21 of LEPRA are also relevant. Section 21 of LEPRA provides that a police officer may, without warrant, search and detain a person and anything in the possession or under the control of a person, if the police officer suspects, on reasonable grounds: that the person is in possession of stolen goods or otherwise unlawfully obtained goods; that the person is in possession of anything intended to be used in connection with the commission of a relevant offence; that the person has in his possession, in a public place, a dangerous article that is or was used in connection with the commission of a relevant offence, or a prohibited drug. On the evidence before the Magistrate, and before the Court, and on the findings of the learned Magistrate, none of those circumstances arise. In my view, s 21 of LEPRA has no relevance to the current situation. 

37The defendant submits that Mr Semaan was not under arrest, lawfully or otherwise, but that Sergeant Poidevin, pursuant to the terms of s 201 of LEPRA, particularly having regard to the power in s 201(3)(e) or (f), was acting lawfully and in execution of his duties. 

38The defendant submits that the learned Magistrate accepted Sergeant Poidevin's evidence that he sought to grab Mr Semaan's phone because he did not want him making phone calls and because he had been involved in incidents in Auburn where people (not Mr Semaan) had contacted a number of other persons who have then attended the location within minutes and created public order incidents. 

39As a consequence, the defendant submits the seizure of the phone was in execution of Sergeant Poidevin's duty. 

40The defendant relies upon the statement of Hodgson J in Albert v Lavin [1982] AC 546, at 553, where his Honour (with whom the other members of the Court concurred) said:

""It is however clear law that a police officer, reasonably believing that a breach of the peace is about to take place, is entitled to take such steps as are necessary to prevent it, including the reasonable use of force .... If those steps include physical restraint of someone then that restraint is not an unlawful detention but a reasonable use of force. It is a question of fact and degree when a restraint has continued for so long that there must be either a release or an arrest, but on the facts found in this case it seems to me to be clear that that point had not been reached. Obviously where a constable is restraining someone to prevent a breach of the peace he must release (or arrest) him as soon as the restrained person no longer presents a danger to the peace. In this case the justices found that the defendant continued in breach of the peace up to the time when he assaulted the constable.""

41Justice Brennan in Gollan v Nugent [1988] HCA 59; (1988) 166 CLR 18 cited the foregoing with approval and said:

""There are some situations where possession is unlawful because of the possessor's intention and where force may be used to deprive him temporarily of the thing possessed. A knife may be taken by force from the grasp of an intending murderer, though it is the knife he uses lawfully to carve the family dinner. But he must have it back once the murderous intention passes or is impossible to effect. Force may be used in such a case because there is a common law authority in any person to take reasonable steps to restrain a breach of the peace which he reasonably apprehends is about to be committed in his presence (Albert v. Lavin (1982) AC 546, at p 565), and the person who exercises that authority is not exposed to a civil liability in trespass or detinue because he takes possession of the weapon being used in breaching the peace. There are other instances where an intention to use a thing in the commission of crime may affect the extent of the liability of one who takes or keeps the thing. Thus, if one person who is drunk goes to drive his car and a second person takes the key out of the ignition, the second person incurs no liability in trespass for damages for depriving the driver temporarily of the key. Nor is he liable in detinue for damages for refusing the driver's immediate demand to return the key, but he would be liable in detinue if he did not return the key when the driver had sobered up or directed delivery of the key to a third person. These are cases where the act on which the plaintiff founds his claim for relief is an offence or an intended offence and the general principle precludes the grant of relief in respect of the criminal use or proposed use of the thing possessed."" (Gollan at 32, per Brennan J.)

42The force of these observations is not affected by his Honour's dissent in the result in Gollan, supra. The majority judgment (Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ), to similar effect, said:

""Rights arising from ownership would not prevail against those powers but they only come into being when there is an immediate threat of a physical kind which is lacking in this case. See Albert v. Lavin (1982) AC 546."" (Gollan at 45.)

43The defendant submits that a police officer acts in the execution of his or her duty from the moment that the police officer embarks upon a lawful task connected to his or her functions as a police officer and continues to act in the execution of that duty for as long as the police officer is engaged in pursuing the task and until it is completed: Re K, supra, at 340-341 and Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Gribble (2004) 151 A Crim R 256 at 263. This submission correctly states the law, but does not deal with the issue of what is ""a lawful task"".

44The submission of the defendant was that Sergeant Poidevin was attempting to seize Mr Semaan's phone as part of his duty to protect the public peace and ensure the safety of the police officers present. Mr Semaan resisted that attempt and, as a consequence, resisted the police officer in the execution of his duty. 

45The defendant raises two submissions on the operation of s 201 of LEPRA. First, it is said that the immediacy of the situation meant that it was not practicable for the police officer to comply with s 201(1) of LEPRA before or at the time of the attempt to exercise the power to seize. Since no action taken by Sergeant Poidevin was outside the ambit of his duty such that he ceased to be acting in its execution, Mr Semaan has resisted the police officer in the execution of his duty. 

46Secondly, the defendant submits (by subsequent written submissions filed by leave of the Court on 31 January 2013), that s 201(2) of LEPRA requires that the information must be provided ""if it is practicable to do so, before or at the time of exercising the power"". 

47The defendant reiterates the impracticability of providing the information at the time or before its exercise. Whether or not the information was thereafter provided (see s 201(2)(b)) is, according to its submission, irrelevant. This is because at the time that the resistance occurred, the actions of Sergeant Poidevin were not unlawful, by virtue of the provisions of s 201 of LEPRA. Those actions were not unlawful, because the information required by s 201(1) of LEPRA can be provided as soon as is reasonably practicable after the exercise of the power and, therefore, a failure to advise Mr Semaan of the reason for the attempted seizure after the offence of resisting was complete could not affect the lawfulness of Sergeant Poidevin's actions at the time of the offence. 

48As is clear from the foregoing, essentially the plaintiff, Mr Semaan, submits that the seizure of the telephone was unlawful, because s 201 of LEPRA requires, for a lawful seizure, certain information to be provided. It was not. Even if it were impracticable to provide it before the time of exercising the power, in order for the seizure to be lawful, the information is required to be provided as soon as is reasonably practicable after the exercise of the power, and it was not. As a consequence the actions of Sergeant Poidevin were unlawful and Mr Semaan was not resisting an officer in the execution of his duty. 

49In its supplementary written submission, filed by leave on 6 March 2013, the plaintiff, Mr Semaan, emphasises the mandatory terms of s 201 of LEPRA and the principle of construction that all words should be given meaning and relies on the judgment of McHugh J in Krakouer v R [1998] HCA 43; (1998) 194 CLR 202 at [62]-[63] and Beckwith v R [1976] HCA 55; (1976) 135 CLR 569 at 574, per Gibbs J (see also Leon Fink Holdings Pty Ltd v Australian Film Commission [1979] HCA 26; (1979) 141 CLR 672 at 679; Project Blue Sky Inc & Ors v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 382 (per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ). 

50Further to the foregoing, the plaintiff, Mr Semaan, submitted that any arrest of Mr Semaan was unlawful. This is no longer a relevant consideration given the concession and/or acknowledgment that no arrest had been effected. 

51Lastly, while acknowledging that the common law permits (or may permit) police to seize property to prevent an imminent breach of the peace, Mr Semaan submits that that power was still subject to the requirement that police make a lawful announcement as to the exercise of that power and was still dependent on a reasonable apprehension of an imminent breach of the peace or a communication to Mr Semaan of the purpose of the seizure. 

Consideration

52I return to the hypothetical set of circumstances outlined in the opening paragraph of these reasons for judgment. The difficulty in this matter derives from that which is said to flow from the judgment of the majority of the High Court in R v Reynhoudt, supra. In that case, Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ held that, in the offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, it was sufficient to prove intent in relation to the assault only and it was not necessary to show intent in relation to, or the accused's knowledge of, the other aspects of the offence, namely, that the person assaulted was a police officer or that he was acting in the execution of his duty. 

53Thus, on the majority view in Reynhoudt, supra, it is irrelevant whether the person charged with the offence knows that the person assaulted is a police officer or knows that the officer is engaged in conduct in execution of his or her duties (or, as it has sometimes been expressed since, knows the facts that would give rise to a conclusion that the officer was engaged in the execution of his or her duties). 

54With great respect to the majority in Reynhoudt, the minority judgment of Dixon CJ is extremely persuasive, particularly in light of the reasons for judgment in He Kaw Teh v R [1985] HCA 43; (1985) 157 CLR 523. Nevertheless, I am bound by the majority judgment in Reynhoudt, unless it has been overturned: see Leonard v Morris (1975) 10 SASR 528 at 530 (per Bray CJ), at 535 (per Walters, J) and at 540 (per Wells J). I respectfully adopt the comment of Bray CJ at 530.4 as to the views of the minority in Reynhoudt.

55While Reynhoudt deals with the offence of assault, the wording of the offence was relevantly aimed at a person who ""assaults, resists or wilfully obstructs any member of the police force in the due execution of his duty"" and, as a consequence, the analysis of the majority is difficult to escape, even in the different circumstances of resisting or wilfully obstructing. So much was the effect of the observations in Leonard v Morris, supra.

56The majority judgment in Reynhoudt has been applied for some significant period. As a consequence, a court would be even more reluctant to depart from a long-standing interpretation of the provision. 

57While the proposition that the Court will continue to apply a construction in circumstances where the provision has been re-enacted has been the subject of much criticism and significant qualification, where, as here, the construction of the section is of long-standing and the section has, in very similar terms, been re-enacted, it is difficult to escape the assumption that the legislature intended to continue the interpretation already determined: see Geelong Harbour Trust Commissioners v Gibbs Bright & Co [1974] UKPCHCA 1; (1974) 129 CLR 576; Bradley v Commonwealth [1973] HCA 34; (1973) 128 CLR 557 at 572; Public Service Association of New South Wales v Industrial Commission of New South Wales (1985) 1 NSWLR 627 at 640; Chappell v A Ross & Sons Pty Ltd [1969] VR 376 at 383, per Winneke CJ and Smith J.

58In Farrell v Alexander [1977] AC 59 at 91, Lord Simon of Glaisdale said:

""Mere repetition of language which has been the subject of previous judicial interpretation is entirely neutral in this respect - or at most implies merely the truism that the language has been the subject of judicial interpretation for whatever (and it may be much or little) that is worth.""

59However, the majority view in Reynhoudt has been applied on a number of occasions and, even if it were not, is binding on this Court. In Jones v Daire (1983) 32 SASR 369, Zelling J applied the same approach and took a broad view of the continuation of duties being executed by a police officer; and see the judgment of Full Court in Leonard v Morris, supra. A similar approach was taken by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Re K, in reference to s 64(1) of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth). 

60More recently Heenan J of the Supreme Court of Western Australia applied the majority reasoning in Reynhoudt in a judgment of that court in Hayward-Jackson v Mason-Walshaw [2012] WASC 107, in which his Honour said:

""[18] In many, if not most, cases involving a prosecution for this offence, as in the present case, a crucial issue is likely to be whether or not the willed act or omission charged against the accused person did constitute an obstruction of the public officer in the performance of his or her functions within the meaning of the section - contrast the views of Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ (majority) and Dixon CJ and Kitto J (dissenting) in R v Reynhoudt [1962] HCA 23; (1962) 107 CLR 381 where, as one of the majority, Menzies J, observed, at 403:

Having regard, therefore, to the words of s 40 [of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic)], to the object of the section and the longstanding acceptance of the view that to make a case thereunder it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove more than the facts that the person assaulted or resisted or wilfully obstructed by the accused was a police officer acting in the due execution of his duty, I consider that the decision in Reg v Galvin [No 1] [1961] VR 733 was correctly decided ...

[19] As opposed to the view of the minority expressed by Dixon CJ at 386 387:

My conclusion is that to be guilty of the offence of assaulting a member of the police force in the due execution of his duty the intent of the supposed offender must go to all the ingredients of the offence. I do not of course use the word 'intention' to refer to the consequences of an act or the desire that a result shall ensue but simply to the commission of what I regard as a compound offence. The offence is an aggravated assault, aggravated by the fact that the person assaulted is a policeman and is in the execution of his duty. That is a compound offence and I think that the guilty mind should go to the elements of which it is composed.

[20] There are many authorities dealing with what constitutes 'obstruction' under comparable legislation. Several of these are collected in Carter's Criminal Law of Queensland (18th ed) [340.30] where the learned authors observe:

As to what amounts to obstruction, see Bastable v Little [1907] 1 KB 59; Betts v Stevens [1910] 1 KB 1 (giving warning); Pankhurst v Jarvis (1910) 22 Cox CC 228; Despard v Wilcox (1910) 22 Cox CC 258 (refusal to disperse); Hinchcliffe v Sheldon [1955] 3 All ER 406 where it was held that 'to obstruct' means to do any act which makes it more difficult for the police to carry out their duty. See also Rice v Connolly [1966] 1 QB 414; Green v Moore [1982] 1 QB 144; Hills v Ellis [1983] 1 QB 681; Lewis v Cox [1985] 1 QB 509. In Carmichael v McGowan [1967] WAR 11 it was held that the ordinary meaning of the word 'obstruct' includes hinder, impede, retard and delay and the offence is not confined to physical obstruction. Rice v Connolly was explained and distinguished in Ingleton v Dibble [1972] 1 QB 480; where it was held that although a refusal to act could not amount to obstruction unless the accused person was under a legal obligation to act in the manner requested by the police officer, there was not a ground for saying that where the obstruction consisted of a positive act it must be unlawful independently of its operation as an obstruction of a police officer.""

61Understandably, much of the authority tends to elide the elements that prove hindrance or obstruction with the requirement that the victim is a police officer executing duties. In some respects, the authorities subsequent to Reynhoudt have, by the manner in which they have treated the term hindrance or obstruction (depending upon the legislative context), applied the approach of the minority in Reynhoudt, rather than the majority. 

62If hindrance or obstruction were to mean any act which makes it more difficult to do that which is sought to be done (and that the person is a police officer executing their duty is an irrelevant consideration in so determining), then the interference by the bar attendant with the purchase of ecstasy tablets, in the opening hypothetical circumstance, would amount to an obstruction or hindrance. 

63Because, as the majority in Reynhoudt explains, the Crown is not required to prove knowledge of the status of the victim as a police officer or knowledge of the facts giving rise to the conduct being part of the execution of duties of a police officer, the bar attendant, in that hypothetical, would be guilty of an offence. If that were the result, it would be a very strange one. The fact, if it were so, that a prosecution would be unlikely in such circumstances does not assist a proper interpretation of the provision.

64It seems, relevant to the facts involved in this appeal, there are three aspects that require consideration. First, even if it were not relevant that the accused knows of the status of the person resisted or that the conduct is part of the execution of duties of a police officer, the defence of honest and reasonable mistake must be examined. 

65Secondly, notwithstanding the Full Court in Leonard v Morris, attention must be paid to the meaning of the term ""resists or hinders"" in the context of s 546C, which words may significantly alter the effect of Reynhoudt, which judgment dealt with ""assault"". 

66Thirdly, in the particular context of these proceedings, the capacity of a police officer to confiscate property (even temporarily) must be examined. 

67Even in offences of strict liability, such as some statutory offences, it is a defence that the accused honestly and reasonably, but mistakenly, believed in a set of facts which, were they to exist, would have rendered the conduct of the accused innocent: Proudman v Dayman [1941] HCA 28; (1941) 67 CLR 536 at 540; Hardgrave v R [1906] HCA 47; (1906) 4 CLR 232. There are a number of particulars to the foregoing that require emphasis. First, the belief must be both honest and reasonable. The belief must also be mistaken. 

68Secondly, if the mistaken belief were, in fact, the situation, the conduct must have been rendered innocent (not merely less seriously, or in a different way, criminal). In other words, if the facts believed by the accused were to exist, it must be that no offence would have been committed, not simply that some other offence would have been committed. 

69Lastly, while described as a defence, honest and reasonable mistake of fact is a matter which the Crown or prosecutor must disprove, once there is some evidence upon which such a mistake is raised: He Kaw Teh v R, supra.

70Because of the effect of the majority judgment in Reynhoudt, the mistake of fact in proceedings for resisting or hindering a police officer in the execution of duty cannot be a mistake as to whether the person is a police officer or whether the police officer is acting in the exercise of duty. Whether particular conduct falls within the class of conduct that would be in execution of the duty of the police officer is not a question of fact, but rather a question of law. Honest and reasonable mistake is confined to a mistake of fact. 

71In this regard the question of honest and reasonable mistake of fact may overlap with the issues that arise from the proper definition of the words ""hinder"" or ""resist"". 

72In the judgment of Dixon CJ, as earlier stated in minority, in Reynhoudt, the then Chief Justice said:

""It is perhaps proper to add that no one denied that a defendant might set up honest and reasonable mistake but the facts in which he honestly and reasonably believed must be such as would make his act innocent, e.g. a justification of the assault.""

73In the judgment of the majority (Wells J, with whom Walters J relevantly agreed) in Leonard v Morris, at 541-542, this issue was discussed:

""It must be borne in mind that the sub-section says nothing about the offender's knowledge or belief. If what the alleged offender did amounts to the prohibited act then, for all that appears expressly in the section, the offence is committed. 

...

The Act explicitly penalizes 'hindering' or 'resisting'; it does not forbid an act that has the effect of hindering, or that amounts to the resistance of, the execution of his duty by a police officer. I shall consider, first, the word 'hinder' alone. What must be proved against an alleged offender is conduct that, as a whole, is correctly characterized as a hindering. 'Hindering' is a complex fact comprising, in my opinion, acts by the alleged offender-movements or sounds or both; knowledge or appreciation that something is apparently being done or attempted by another; a realization that the probable consequence of what he, the offender, is doing will be to impede or obstruct the other person's acts or attempted acts; and an actual impeding or obstruction of the other person's acts or attempted acts in consequence of what the alleged offender did.""

Following Farah Constructions v Say-Dee [2007] HCA 22; (2007) 230 CLR 89 I am constrained to follow the foregoing.

74Assaulting a police officer (or anyone) is a criminal offence. Thus, when one is applying Reynhoudt to the offence of assaulting a police officer, the fact that the person assaulted is a police officer in the execution of duty is an aggravating circumstance to what is otherwise a criminal act. On the other hand, it is not a criminal act to resist or hinder a person. It is only, relevantly, a criminal act when one resists or hinders a police officer in the execution of duty. 

75If the criminal conduct were an assault, then an honest and reasonable mistake may be that the accused (or another person) is being assaulted. Thus, if a police officer, not in uniform, seemingly attacks an accused (or another person) otherwise than in self-defence, the accused, who grabs the police officer in order to stop the assault, would not, himself, be committing an assault, and, therefore, would not be assaulting a police officer in the execution of duty. The accused would not be committing an assault because of the doctrine of self-defence or defence of another (s 418 Crimes Act). Could it seriously be suggested, in the foregoing circumstances, that the putative accused, having a defence to assault, is guilty of hindering or resisting?

76In the foregoing illustration, the mistake of fact (assuming it be both reasonable and honest) is the circumstance pertaining to the motive/reason for the attack by the police officer. Motive is a question of fact. If an accused had an honest and reasonable mistaken belief as to the motive or reason for the action, which belief, if true, would have rendered the action innocent, the accused is not guilty. It is for the prosecutor to disprove the mistake. Often, but not always, the reason or motive for an officer's conduct will be critical in determining whether the exercise of power is within or outside the exercise of an officer's duty. Because the High Court has determined (R v Reynhoudt) that the prosecutor does not have to prove that an accused knows that the conduct was in execution of the officer's duty, a mistake of fact as to motive/reason, of itself, although honest and reasonable, will not give rise to a ""defence"". Rather, there must be a justification for the conduct said to amount to assault, resist or hinder [e.g. defence of self or another (s 418 of the Crimes Act); entitlement to assert the right to possess one's own property (Mr Semaan); or to ensure one's property is not being used for the commission of a felony (the bar attendant)], which, when considered with the honest and reasonable mistaken belief as to the reason for the officer's conduct, gives rise to a ""defence"".

77Thus, be it the bar attendant or Mr Semaan, if the putative accused mistook the reason for the purchase of drugs or the seizing of the phone, respectively, which misunderstanding would have put the conduct of the police officer outside the scope of her or his duty, and which mistaken belief was both reasonable and honest, the person charged must be found not guilty, if there were otherwise a justification (or defence) to the conduct, being, for example, relevantly, the assertion of an existing legal right, which gave rise to the conduct said to be an assault, resist or hinder. Moreover, it is for the prosecutor to prove there was no such mistaken belief. In the case now on appeal, it did not. Error of law has occurred, because there is no evidence going to this issue and because the learned Magistrate did not consider it. This is the first basis for the orders I make. Likewise, the foregoing analysis would have been a defence in the example given at [75] above. 

78In Plunkett v Kroemer [1934] SASR 124, Napier J of the Supreme Court of South Australia determined that the sounding of an alarm to warn persons of the impending arrival of police was an attempt to hinder the police in the execution of duty. His Honour said:

""It must be conceded that, for the purposes of this charge, the complainant has to prove an actual hindrance, in the sense of some appreciable obstruction to, or interference with, the performance by the constable of his duties; but 'hinder' is not a word of art, or capable of precise definition, and it is a question of fact and of degree whether in the circumstances of the particular case the obstruction or interference was appreciable. If the constable is frustrated in his attempt to perform his duty, or retarded in the execution thereof, then, clearly, he has been 'hindered'; but I think that the fair and natural meaning of the word goes further than that. I think that a constable is 'hindered' by any obstruction or interference that makes his duty substantially more difficult of performance.""

79A similar example in every day life would be a person flashing headlights at oncoming traffic to warn of a mobile speed camera or random breath test. That conduct would probably amount to hindering a police officer in the execution of duty.

80In the foregoing factual scenario, like that before the High Court in Reynhoudt, no real difficulty arises relating to the duty to be performed by the police officer. Here, however, Mr Semaan asserts his right to possess his own property. Is that a hindrance to the execution of duty by the police?

81Another illustration may be useful. Assume a police officer stops the driver of a car for a random breath test. Assume that the driver has not been drinking and does not register any, or any prohibited, content of alcohol on the device utilised. At that point in time the officer, who is in uniform, observes an occurrence a distance away that is either a breach of the peace or that would give rise to a breach of the peace. The officer directs the owner of the vehicle to alight from the car, and to give the officer the keys, so that the officer can seize the car and use it temporarily in order to go to the location of the breach of the peace and to prevent it. 

82In those circumstances, the officer is taking a step that the officer reasonably believes is to prevent a breach of the peace (see Albert v Lavin, supra). She or he is informing the driver of the vehicle that s/he is a police officer; we can assume that s/he tells the driver her/his name and place of duty and the reason for the exercise of the power. Is the owner of the vehicle hindering a police officer in the execution of duty if the owner refuses to allow the police officer to take the car and to drive it? 

83If the defendant's submission is given full force, the person could be charged and, on the defendant's view of the law, would be found guilty. 

84In my view, it is not resisting a police officer in the execution of duty to assert a right to possess one's own property, if that property is not to be used directly in the breach of peace or criminal conduct, other than in circumstances where the person is under arrest. 

85More obviously, the third of the issues that need to be examined, relating to the confiscation of property, relieves Mr Semaan of liability. It also applies to the illustration above relating to the motor vehicle. The capacity of a police officer to seize property, otherwise than in circumstances where the property belongs to a person under arrest, extends to seizing property to prevent a breach of the peace, where the police officer reasonably believes that a breach of the peace is about to take place. 

86However, in the illustration of the motor vehicle above, the possession of the motor vehicle by the driver was not reasonably believed by the police officer to be the cause of a breach of the peace, and the seizing of it would not have prevented a breach of the peace. The seizing of the property was for the purpose of enabling the police officer to travel to a location at which certain steps would be taken in order to seek to prevent a breach of the peace. 

87Likewise, the evidence before the learned Magistrate, in this case, did not extend to the proposition that the telephone, which the officer sought to seize, was being used to breach the peace. Even if the telephone were being used, it is not the telephone (or the telephone call) that causes the breach of the peace. A communication to his friends, if that were the intent of Mr Semaan (which was and is unknown), to obtain their presence at the scene would not cause a breach of the peace. If Mr Semaan were to incite his friends to attend in order to intimidate the police, he may be inciting an affray, which would be a criminal offence and give rise to a power of seizure for different reasons than the breach of peace; a reason upon which neither the prosecutor nor the State of New South Wales has relied.

88The breach of the peace, if any, would be caused by a new intervening act, being the unlawful and illegal acts of those that were, on the foregoing hypothetical, called and subsequently attended. 

89A difficulty arises from allowing the police officer to establish reasonable apprehension of a breach of public peace based upon nothing more than a person commencing to dial a telephone. In so doing, the officer is relying on the conduct of other people on other occasions unrelated to this incident or to this accused. Given the request for identification, I infer that the police were not familiar with Mr Semaan. Perhaps, as seems to be the case, it was something about Auburn that triggered the officer's suspicion.

90The learned Magistrate found, as a fact, that the officer was executing his duty. In doing so, the learned Magistrate took the view that the suspicion as to the breach of the peace was reasonable and, therefore, lawful. The conclusion as to the existence of a reasonable suspicion and the lawfulness of the officer's conduct are questions of law based on the primary facts proved. 

91In Agfa-Gevaert, the High Court (Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) recited, with approval, the reasons for judgment of Fullagar J in Hayes v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1956] HCA 21; (1956) 96 CLR 47: 

""Where the factum probandum involves a term used in a statute, the question whether the accepted facta probantia establish that factum probandum will generally - so far as I can see, always - be a question of law.""

Note: In the above passage ""factum probandum"" means a fact to be proved or, more accurately in this context, proposition to be established; and ""facta probantia"" means the evidentiary (or primary) facts: see Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law Section 2, at 14 - 15 (Peter Tillers ed. 1983).

92Here, the primary facts proved were the actions (including statements) of the accused (Mr Semaan) and the actions (including statements) of the police officer, including his belief. The conclusion that the conduct of the officer is lawful is a question of law alone only if the primary facts found were incapable of being lawful: see the Australian Gaslight taxonomy at (4) or the Pozzolanic taxonomy at (4) referred to at [8] of this judgment, as adapted to refer to the common law rather than statute. 

93In other words, the question whether facts, fully found, fall within the lawful conduct of a police officer (either under statute or at common law) is a question of law and, to the extent that that conduct is incapable of being lawful (as distinct from being regarded as within or without the categorisation as lawful depending on the relative significance of some of those facts), the question is a question of law alone: see by way of contrast my judgment in L & B Linings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales [2011] NSWSC 474 at [79] and Assadourian v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales (Northern Region) [2011] NSWSC 1052 at [31].

94The confiscation of Mr Semaan's property, being the mobile telephone, was not a step necessary to prevent a breach of the peace, which is the circumstance upon which the defendant relies. The telephone call would be a communication. It had not yet been made. Even if it were made, the communication would not be a breach of the peace. Moreover, the property, being the mobile telephone, could not (assuming it were used otherwise than as a weapon, e.g. to hit someone) be property that would cause a breach of peace. 

95For the foregoing reasons, the seizing of the property was not lawful as justified by a breach of the peace. As a consequence of that conclusion, Mr Semaan was entitled to assert his ownership and possession of the mobile telephone and was not resisting or hindering a police officer in the execution of duty: Williams v DPP [2011] NSWSC 1085; McLiney v Minister [1911] VLR 347; Coleman v Power [2004] HCA 39; (2004) 220 CLR 1. 

96In Coleman v Power, McHugh J said:

""[117] Each of the sub-sections under which the appellant was charged is predicated on the lawfulness of the action being resisted or obstructed. It is not part of an officer's duty to engage in unlawful conduct. If the officer acts outside his or her duty, an element of the offence is missing. In Re K, after reviewing the authorities on the scope of an officer's duty, the Full Court of the Federal Court said: 

'The effect of all those cases is that a police officer acts in the execution of his duty from the moment he embarks upon a lawful task connected with his functions as a police officer, and continues to act in the execution of that duty for as long as he is engaged in pursuing the task and until it is completed, provided that he does not in the course of the task do anything outside the ambit of his duty so as to cease to be acting therein.'""

97Once the seizure of the property was unlawful, the Crown cannot prove an element of the charge of resisting a police officer in the execution of his or her duty and the conviction should be set aside. 

98Notwithstanding the foregoing, the learned Magistrate found as a matter of fact that the action was taken for that reason and that the officer held that belief reasonably. As a consequence, I am unable to overturn the judgment on that basis, particularly, because it is not a ground of appeal.

99Nevertheless, underpinning the proceedings below was the lawfulness of the conduct of the officer. That is also the central issue in this appeal. Once Mr Semaan asserts his right to retain his own property and the inability of the police to seize it, there is material upon which the issue of the mistaken motive arises, requiring the prosecutor to negative an honest and reasonable belief that the motive of the officer was one outside the class that would render the seizure lawful. That is a purpose of s 201 of LEPRA.

100I need to deal with the effect of non-compliance with s 201 of LEPRA. The criterion of practicability that governs the timing of the announcements required by s 201(1) may significantly affect the consequence of non-compliance. 

101If, as is alleged in these proceedings, it were impracticable to make the announcements required by s 201(1) of LEPRA before (or at the time of) the seizure of property, it is necessary to comply with the announcement requirements as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. Circumstances may arise that would render it never reasonably practicable, for example, where the person arrested or subject to the exercise of the power were to die or to flee. Such an eventuality does not seem, in my view, to lead to a view that the original exercise of power was therefore unlawful. 

102The answer to the question may reside in the determination of the effect of the breach of a mandatory provision. The breach of a mandatory provision does not always result in unlawfulness and does not always render the conduct void (or even voidable): Hunter Resources Ltd v Melville [1988] HCA 5; (1988) 164 CLR 234 at 251-252 (per Dawson J); Yango Pastoral Company Pty Ltd v First Chicago Australia Ltd [1978] HCA 42; (1978) 139 CLR 410 at 423 (per Mason J); Nelson v Nelson [1995] HCA 25; (1995) 184 CLR 538 at 590-591 (per Toohey J) and at 610 (per McHugh J). 

103To question the consequences of a failure to comply with the provisions of s 201 of LEPRA does not detract from the proposition that the provisions are mandatory. Such a failure may not result in the conduct being unlawful if, as is contended in these proceedings, the conduct would otherwise be lawful. 

104In these proceedings, the defendant has made no (and the prosecutor below did not) attempt to prove that provision of the information required by s 201(1) of LEPRA remained impracticable. Therefore, there is no evidence upon which it was open to the learned Magistrate to find that the occasion for the provision of the material had not yet arisen. The prosecutor, therefore, did not prove that the police officer had complied with s 201 of LEPRA.

105The provisions of s 201 must be given a purposive construction: Project Blue Sky. The purpose of the provision includes overcoming the difficulty to which I have already averted, namely, a mistaken, honest and reasonable belief as to the motive of the officer. 

106The officer is required to inform the person of the fact that s/he is a police officer; the station from which the officer derives; and the reason [or motive] for the exercise of power. After being so informed, the possibility of honest and reasonable mistake would not ordinarily arise (or, at least, would require some evidence to overcome the necessary inference from the provision of the information).

107The effect of s 201(2) of LEPRA is that the time for compliance does not arise until (or as soon as) it is not impracticable to comply. When it is first ""not impracticable"", the duty arises. Failure to comply (or compliance) with the duty, if that time were later than the exercise of the power, has a retrospective effect on the status of the conduct. In so doing, the officers are protected from any ""unlawfulness"" associated with the exercise of power.

108In the absence of evidence of compliance with s 201(1) of LEPRA, when first ""not impracticable"", prosecuting authorities are not entitled to rely on or to assert that the conduct was lawful. In other words, even if the conduct may not, at the time of the exercise of power, be ""unlawful"", in the absence of compliance with the mandatory provisions of s 201(1) of LEPRA, at the time prescribed, prosecuting authorities are not entitled to rely on the ""lawfulness"" of the conduct, unless, again reverting to a purposive construction, they can prove that the person, against whom the lawfulness is to be asserted, was otherwise aware of the facts prescribed in s 201(1) of LEPRA, or that it had not yet become ""practicable"". Neither has been proved in this prosecution.

109The prosecuting authority must prove that the police officer was executing his duty, and, to do so, must assert and prove the ""lawfulness"" of the officer's conduct. Because of the non-compliance with s 201(1) of LEPRA, and the failure to prove that the time for compliance had not yet arisen or passed, the prosecution is unable to do that and, therefore, it is unable to prove that Mr Semaan has resisted the officer in the execution of his duty. 

110This latter conclusion forms an alternative basis for the orders that I make. Alternatively, as earlier stated, in the absence of such evidence, the prosecutor is unable to negative an honest and reasonable mistake as to the reason/motive of the officer, when Mr Semaan was asserting a right or justification for the conduct. The two issues are, in that sense, related.

111Given the nature of the conclusions at which I have arrived, there is no purpose in the proceedings being remitted to the Local Court. The evidence would allow no other result than the dismissal of the charge and I will so order.

112Mr Semaan's summons seeks an order for costs. No submission has been made that exceptional circumstances, relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, arise, such that the terms of s 70(1)(d) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 apply and no other provision of s 70(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act applies. In those circumstances no order for costs will be made. 

113For the foregoing reasons, the Court makes the following orders:

(1)The order made by the Local Court of New South Wales on 4 April 2012 at Burwood convicting Richard Semaan of the offence of resist a police officer in the execution of his or her duty, contrary to s 546C of the Crimes Act 1900, be set aside;

(2)The charge against Richard Semaan, being that on 14 September 2011 at Auburn, he did resist Sergeant Poidevin, a member of the Police Force in the execution of his duty, is dismissed;

(3)No order for costs.

2761142,R v Hollaway [2013] NSWSC 218,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: On 22 October 2012, Karyna Hollaway pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Alan Truran between the 21 March 2011 and 11 June 2011 at Hornsby in the State of New South Wales. The Crown accepted the plea to manslaughter, in full satisfaction of the indictment of murder which was then withdrawn. 

2The Crown's acceptance of the plea was based on substantial impairment by abnormality of mind pursuant to s 23A Crimes Act 1900. 

3The maximum penalty for the crime of manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment.

4During the proceedings on sentence, Mr M Hobart SC appeared for the Crown and Ms C Loukas SC for the offender. 

5A statement of agreed facts was tendered by consent. The agreed facts (omitting annexed statements) are: 
1.""In early 2011, the offender Karyna Hollaway, was in a relationship with Kaye Skene. Skene had known the deceased Alan Truran for about fifteen years. They met when she cared for his mother in an aged care facility at Waitara, New South Wales.
2.Skene and the deceased often smoked cannabis and consumed alcohol together. Skene was a chronic gambler and relied on the deceased financially. It appears from time to time Skene engaged in consensual sexual intercourse with the deceased. Skene also claimed to have been sexually assaulted by the deceased during their association.
3.In 2007 Kay Skene and the offender met at a rehabilitation centre. Skene introduced the offender to the deceased and during the ensuing four years the three met together on a number of occasions. Skene told the offender that she had been anally raped by the deceased.
4.In March 2011 Skene and the offender came to stay with the deceased at his home in Hornsby. On 21 March 2011 police arrested Skene at the deceased's house on outstanding warrants. The deceased, the offender and Skene had been drinking and arguing. Skene was reported to the police by the offender. Skene remained in custody from then until early June 2011.
5.Up until Skene was taken into custody the offender had not spent time alone with the deceased.
6.The offender continued living at the deceased's house. The offender was admitted as an involuntary patient to the psychiatric unit at Hornsby Hospital in late March 2011 and gave her discharge address as that of the deceased.

7. On 1 April 2011 a psychiatric nurse from the hospital visited at the deceased's address. A man fitting a description of the deceased answered the door. The nurse spoke to the offender at the house.
Events leading up to offence as described in report of Dr. O'Dea

8.Ms Hollaway was assessed at Hornsby Hospital on 16 March 2011 after having cut herself again in the context of reportedly ""hearing voices"".
9.Ms Hollaway represented to Hornsby Psychiatric Hospital from 30 March 2011 to 31 March 2011 with a history of declining mental state, characterised by disorganisation, ideas of reference, auditory hallucinations, and paranoid persecutory delusions, in a setting of increased alcohol and cannabis use. She was commenced on antipsychotic medication (Olanzapine, Zyprexa®. 20mg Daily by tablet) and that after settling into the ward was reviewed by the psychiatrist and discharged the following day at her request.
10.Ms Hollaway told Dr O'Dea that she subsequently returned to [the deceased's house] and that ... the second night back [my partner] got arrested ... she didn't finish her charge ... she did it in gaol. . I rang the police ... by this stage the voices had kicked in..."". She explained that these 'voices' were, both male' and female' voices ... laughing real bad ... the voices were saying that [my partner] had ' put them in my mind... the voices said the government had put a chip in 'my body ... they were bringing all my childhood back to me ... the next day [the deceased] said I could stay with him ... not have to pay rent ... do my own thing ... I didn't feel comfortable ... but I didn't have anywhere to go and for the next 3 weeks he kept pestering me for sex ...'.

Offence as described to Dr. O'Dea

11.Ms Hollaway told Dr O'Dea that on the day of the alleged offence, approximately 3 weeks after her partner had been detained in custody, she had been playing pool in the back shed with the deceased from approximately 11 am. She told Dr O'Dea that she had been smoking cannabis and drinking alcohol throughout the day.
12.Ms Hollaway stated that that at approximately 5pm that evening, ... when we were onto our second bottle of rum ... I had gone to the kitchen ... I'm not sure why ... he's come up from behind me ... he's grabbed me around the neck saying to me 'you owe me, you owe me, I'm going to have my way' ... and I thought, that's the end of me, ... to me I felt he was saying he was going to kill me ... to rape me ... I broke free ... grabbed a knife on the table ... 'nearby a big turbo cooker ... I don't remember what kind of a knife ... I turned around and stabbed him the once ... but he's kept coming and I kept stabbing him ... I got him about 3 times he staggered back and fell off the porch ... and that's where he lay ... I was crying ... frightened ... scared ... the voices were saying - you've killed somebody..."".
Subsequent Events 

13. Sometime in April the offender told her aunt Shirley Haynes that she hadkilled the deceased. Shirley Haynes reported the matter to a constable atWindsor Police Station. The police officer concerned misplaced the note and subsequently forgot about it. Consequently the information was not acted upon. He recalls being told this information sometime after 14 April 2011.
14.On 8 June 2011 police attended the deceased's house and noticed that the mail had been building up for some time. On 10 June 2011 police returned to the house armed with a search warrant. The badly decomposed remains of the deceased were located near the back veranda under some towels.
15.On Friday 10 June 2011, the offender was arrested at 52/17 William Street, Ryde and conveyed to Ryde Police Station.

Evidence Regarding the Deceased


16.The deceased suffered a brain injury in 1969 following which he developed impaired mental stability and judgment and marked hearing loss.
17.The deceased had a history of sexual disinhibition and impulsive violence. The deceased received a formal warning for kicking a client while employed at the Autistic Association in 2003. His membership of the Asquith Bowling Club was suspended for five years, after the deceased showed a 13 year-old girl his T-shirt ""I have a PhD - Pretty Huge Dick"" in 2008.
18.The deceased had a history of offences involving violence. Additionally an assault against Skene by the deceased is recorded in 2000 on the deceased's criminal history.""


6The honesty and reliability of the offender's account of the offence to Dr O'Dea is supported by the deceased's history of sexual disinhibition and impulsive violence and the pre-existence of her mental illness. 

7Although the date of the offence as set out in the indictment is between 21 March 2011 and 11 June 2011, it appears the offence was committed after 1 April 2011 as a man fitting the description of the deceased answered the door at his address on 1 April 2011 and sometime in April 2011 the offender told her aunt that she had killed the deceased. 

8The crime of manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life and has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime: R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402. The value, which the community places upon the preservation of human life, is reflected by the need to have the conduct denounced by a sentence appropriate to the circumstances of the case: R v Macdonald (unrep, NSWCCA 12 December 1995). The starting point in the present sentencing exercise, as in all offences of manslaughter, is that the life of Alan Truran has been unlawfully taken: R v Blacklidge (unrep, NSWCCA 12 December 1995). 

9The agreed facts disclose that the offender stabbed the deceased with a knife more than once. It was her recollection that she ""got him about three times."" The deceased was 61 years old when he died. 

10The Crown's acceptance of the partial defence of ""substantial impairment by abnormality of mind"" was founded upon the psychiatric reports of Dr Jeremy O'Dea dated 18 October 2012, Dr Olav Nielssen dated 5 June 2012 and 31 October 2012 and Dr Stephen Allnutt dated 28 July 2011. These reports were tendered jointly by the Crown and the offender. 

11Dr Allnutt, who interviewed the offender on 21 July 2011, believed that at the time of the offence, the offender was likely experiencing symptoms of psychosis. He considered that a differential diagnosis would include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and a drug induced psychosis. 

12Dr O'Dea interviewed the offender at the request of the Crown on 6 October 2012. His psychiatric diagnoses were that of Substance Use Disorder - currently in remission, Drug Induced Psychosis - currently in remission and Personality Disorder. Dr O'Dea opined (par 54): 

""It would appear that at least from the beginning of 2011, through the time of the alleged offence and until at least some weeks after her detention in custody in June 2011, [the offender] had experienced psychotic symptoms and displayed signs of psychosis resulting in a psychiatric diagnosis of drug induced psychosis"".

13And at pars 56, 58: 

""Her substance use disorder has occurred in the context of a disorganised childhood with a history of sexual abuse, self harm and offending behaviour, again from a very young age. Her history of offending behaviour, substance abuse, self harm behaviours, and general interpersonal relations may reflect an emerging personality disorder.

...

It could be argued that at the time of the alleged offence, [the offender] was suffering from an abnormality of mind arising from underlying conditions of a drug induced psychosis and vulnerable personality, that may have had a significant impact on her overall ability to control her actions at the time, thereby supporting a defence of substantial impairment..."" 

14It is plain that the onset of the offender's psychotic illness had preceded the commission of the offence. She was admitted to the Royal Perth Hospital from 31 January 2011 to 1 February 2011, with a diagnosis of a drug-induced psychosis after hearing voices. She was assessed at Hornsby Hospital on 16 March 2011 after having cut herself in the context of ""hearing voices"". Dr O'Dea recounts at par 2 that the offender ""represented to Hornsby Psychiatric Hospital from 30 March 2011 to 31 March 2011 with a history of declining mental state, characterised by disorganisation, ideas of reference, auditory hallucinations, and paranoid persecutory delusions, in a setting of increased alcohol and cannabis use.""

15Dr Olav Nielssen interviewed the offender at the request of her solicitors on 2 May 2012. His psychiatric diagnoses of the offender were Substance Dependence and Abuse Disorder, Drug Induced Psychotic Illness (in remission), and Probable Personality Disorder. Unlike Dr O'Dea, who confined the impact of the abnormality of mind to the offender's overall ability to control her actions, Dr Nielssen considered that the offender's ability to understand events, to judge whether her actions were right or wrong and to control herself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from a drug induced psychosis on the background of an unstable personality. Dr Nielssen was specifically asked to prepare a supplementary report in light of the plea to manslaughter on the ground of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. In a report dated 31 October 2012, Dr Nielssen states at p 3:

""...I confirm the opinion expressed in the previous report, that [the offender] has the defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind as a result of the effect of a drug induced psychosis on the background of an unstable personality. Her perception of events was affected by the persecutory belief that people were playing games with her and that the voices she could hear were originating from a microchip inserted in her brain. Her ability to judge right from wrong was also affected by her increased perception of threat and hence her propensity to believe that she was acting to defend herself in some situation in which she felt threatened as a result of persecutory beliefs. I believe her ability to control her actions was also impaired as a result of her combination of psychiatric disorders, as her unstable mood and high level of arousal is likely to have increased her propensity to act on impulse in response to a perceived threat."" 

16I find it is more probable than not that at the time of the stabbing, the offender's capacity to understand events, and to judge whether her actions were right or wrong, and to control herself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition of a drug induced psychosis on the background of unstable personality. The wide embrace of the offender's substantial impairment, reduces significantly the offender's moral culpability for the offence: s 21A(3)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. However, it does not negate her moral culpability: R v Dawes [2004] NSWCCA 363 at [34]. 

17The Crown acknowledged that the deceased's conduct allowed for an assessment of provocation under s 21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Provocation by the deceased is a mitigating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence: s 21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 172 at [42], I expressed the view that where provocation is established such that it is a mitigating factor under s 21A(3)(c), it is a fundamental quality of the offending which may reduce its objective seriousness. In any event, provocation is a factor relevant to the appropriate sentence to be imposed: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357. 

18Ms Loukas submitted that the agreed statement of facts gave rise to the partial defence to murder of provocation under s 23 Crimes Act and to the issue of manslaughter by way of excessive self defence. 

19I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the deceased's conduct in grabbing the offender around the neck and saying that ""[he] was going to have [his] way"", led her to believe that the deceased intended to sexually assault her. The offender was not only provoked by the deceased, but was acting on the belief at the time of the stabbing that it was necessary to do what she did in order to defend herself. Without the deceased's sexual advances upon the offender, the offence would not have occurred. I take into account these matters in mitigation of the objective seriousness of the offence. However, by her plea of guilty to manslaughter, the offender acknowledged that the stabbing of the deceased was not a reasonable response in the circumstances, as she perceived them to be. 

20Another matter that mitigates the seriousness of the offence is that it was not planned, but was committed on the spur of the moment, the offender reacting to the exigencies that she found herself in: s 21A (3)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

21The offender's criminal record in New South Wales discloses convictions as an adult in the Local Court for common assault (2007), contravention of an apprehended violence order and possession of a prohibited drug (2009). She has matters in the Children's Court that include malicious wounding and contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order. Her criminal record in Victoria includes a charge of burglary (2009) and in Western Australia, charges of assault, breach of a police restraining order (2010) and trespass (2009). These offences were dealt with by fines and community based sentencing options. She has not been previously sentenced to imprisonment. The offender's criminal history does not entitle her to leniency but it is not such that it is a matter of aggravation. 

22The offender offered to plead guilty to manslaughter in late August 2012 and provided her psychiatrist's reports to the Crown in early September. Unsurprisingly, the Crown asked Dr O'Dea to interview the offender and the offender's plea was ultimately accepted. The jury was to be empanelled on 29 October 2012 with an estimated length of the trial being three weeks. In view of the offender's offer, the case was not prepared for trial. I assess the utilitarian value of the plea to be 20 per cent. 

23Remorse as a mitigating factor is qualified by s 21A (3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which requires the offender to provide evidence that she has accepted responsibility for her actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by them. By her plea of guilty, the offender has accepted responsibility for her offending. The offender told Dr O'Dea of her distress about the offence. She has written to the court expressing her remorse and sorrow for what she has done. I accept that the offender is remorseful. I take into account her remorse as a mitigating factor. 

24The offender did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. Her subjective circumstances are drawn from the histories that she provided to the psychiatrists. She was born on 6 January 1989 and was 22 years old at the time of the commission of the offence. 

25Without detailing all of the histories in the psychiatric reports, it is evident as Ms Loukas points out in written submissions, that the offender's background is one of marked childhood and developmental adversity. I accept that she was raised in an atmosphere of domestic violence and subjected to serious emotional neglect, as well as physical and sexual abuse. 

26It appears that the offender was sexually abused by her mother's partner when she was 11 years old. She described further sexual abuse by an elder brother and a neighbour. At the age of 13, she was made a ward of the State. The offender reported episodes to Dr Nielssen of deliberate self harm from the age of 12 or 13 mainly by cutting her left forearm and that she developed symptoms of an eating disorder. She was admitted to Bloomfield Psychiatric Hospital, Orange, in December 2004 with a diagnosis of ""Stress Reaction Disorder"", having cut her wrist following a miscarriage. The offender was then 15 years old. She presented to Dubbo Base Hospital in April 2005 with thoughts of self harm and depression.

27The offender began drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis from her early teenage years. She reported the onset of abuse of methamphetamine at around the age of 18, which has from that time been her main drug of abuse. She was enrolled in the MERIT program and admitted to the Lyndon Community Rehabilitation facility to stop her drug abuse on two occasions, but relapsed soon afterwards. 

28Having left school during year eight, the offender has had limited education. She told Dr Nielssen that she attended numerous schools, but did not complete a year at any one school. However, the offender reported that she was literate and attempted a tourism course at TAFE. She had been employed as a ride operator at country shows. 

29I find that the offender's dysfunctional background was on the balance of probabilities causative of her descent into alcohol and drug abuse at an early age. 

30Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion (at p5) that when he saw the offender, ""she was manifesting residual symptoms of an almost fully resolved psychosis"" and was developing insight into her prior experience of auditory hallucinations. He considered that there remained a risk that she could experience a relapse or a risk of deterioration in her mental state. 

31Dr O'Dea reported (at p 10) that the offender ""with apparent prolonged abstinence from substance abuse in custody in the context of psychiatric treatment with antipsychotic medication...has reportedly been free of psychotic symptoms for approximately 1 month and presented at interview without evident psychosis."" He opined that the offender must remain ""abstinent from alcohol and other drug use in the community in the long term in order to manage and minimise her risk of engaging in further offending behaviour in the community in the long term, and to manage and minimise the risk of her suffering further psychiatric symptomatology.""

32In his report dated 5 June 2012 (at p 6), Dr Nielssen made reference to the ""recent return of symptoms suggests that she may in time develop a chronic form of mental illness."" In his later report, he was of the opinion that the offender might have an underlying schizophrenic illness for which she would need long term treatment with antipsychotic medication. Dr Nielssen considered that the offender has a high risk of developing symptoms of psychosis if she was to resume using cannabis or amphetamine. He recommended a long period of supervision of her mental state and abstinence from illicit drugs after release. 

33The offender is not currently taking medication. She is in employment within the prison system and receives a basic wage. Ms Loukas did not submit, nor do I find, that because of the offender's mental illness, a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily upon her. 

34Although I accept Ms Loukas' submission that the offender's remorse and acceptance of responsibility for the manslaughter can allow the court some confidence that she has begun the process of addressing her offending behaviour, I am unable to make a positive finding that she is unlikely to re-offend or has good prospects of rehabilitation. Much will depend on the offender's ability to avoid relapsing to alcohol and or drug misuse upon release. Her previous failures to overcome the use of illicit drugs do not encourage an optimistic view being taken. 

35The offender's mental illness has the consequence that she is an inappropriate vehicle for making an example for others. Nevertheless considerations of general deterrence are not rendered completely irrelevant: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1; (2010) 205 A Crim R 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194. I do, however, give little weight to general deterrence. 

36I accept Dr Nielssen's opinion that the offender has a high risk of developing symptoms of psychosis if she was to resume the use of illicit drugs and Dr O'Dea's view that she must abstain from alcohol and other drug use to minimise her risk of offending. In these circumstances, the offender's mental illness does not eliminate the need for specific deterrence. On the other hand, it was not submitted by the Crown, nor do I find that the offender's mental illness makes her more of a danger to the community: De La Rosa at [177].

37The offender is 24 years old. In considering her need for rehabilitation, I take into account that she is a comparatively young woman. I find that special circumstances exist that justify a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term of the sentence, being the need for supervision of her mental state and to remain abstinent from alcohol and drug use. 

38Victim impact statements from Kristy-Lee Holdsworth and Stan McDowell were tendered without objection. The contents of the statements cannot be used by me to increase the offender's sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased's relations and express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them. 

39Various cases were cited by counsel. Ms Loukas made particular reference to cases where offenders had been sentenced on the basis of more than one of the partial defences to manslaughter. I have found all of this material helpful, but each case depends on its own facts. 

40Mr Crown submitted that when the offender is released to parole, there should be strict conditions of supervision imposed such as the taking of urine and blood samples to ensure that she does not partake in excessive alcohol or drug use. The offender's release to parole and conditions of that parole are a matter for the New South Wales State Parole Authority, but I would endorse Mr Crown's call for strict conditions upon release and recommend such an approach to the Parole Authority.

41Taking into account all factors that are relevant to sentence, the appropriate undiscounted starting point of the overall sentence I conclude is 6 years 8 months. The overall sentence is reduced by 20 per cent to 5 years 4 months.

42The offender has been in custody since 10 June 2011 which is the agreed date for the commencement of the sentence. 

43Karyna Hollaway for the offence of manslaughter, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years which is to commence on 10 June 2011 and to expire on 9 June 2014. I set a balance of term of 2 years 4 months which is to commence on 10 June 2014 and will expire on 9 October 2016.

44The earliest date that you will be eligible to be released on parole is 
9 June 2014.

2761144,R v Minna [2013] NSWDC 104,"sentence

1HIS HONOUR: This is a tragic case. The Offender, Mattia Minna, a young man from Genoa, Italy visiting Australia as a tourist, appears before me today for sentence having adhered to his plea of guilty to an offence against the provisions of s 52A(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 in that he on 9 June 2012 at Euston in the State of New South Wales did drive a vehicle, to wit YEO 747 Victoria when it was involved in an impact occasioning the death of Carollynne Olivie, and at the time of impact the said Mattia Minna was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to other persons.

2He initially pleaded guilty before the Local Court Balranald on 7 November 2012. He was then committed for sentence before this Court sitting at Griffith. The matter, for various reasons, none of which were the fault of the Offender, did not proceed on those allocated sittings. Accordingly, the matter was listed before me at the commencement of these sittings and the sentence hearing allocated for last Friday, 22 March 2013. The sentence hearing then proceeded but submissions did not conclude until after 4pm. Accordingly, I continued the Offender's bail and adjourned the matter for conclusion and sentence today. 

3In these remarks I will refer to Carollynne Olivie as the deceased. I do so for ease of reference rather than any disrespect or lack of personality and identity. She was no doubt an enthusiastic and energetic young lady with much to give this world. She was loved by many and the loss and grief suffered by her family and friends must be unfathomable. I acknowledge her passing and convey the Court's sympathy and respects to her and all those who loved and cared for her.

4The particulars of driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to which the plea has been entered are twofold: the swerving manoeuvre (apparently the only evidence of which is that of the Offender who stated to Police in interview that he did so to avoid a kangaroo), and a blood alcohol reading of 0.137 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. 

5The fateful incident occurred in the early hours of the morning of 9 June 2012 when a group of five young people were travelling home to Robinvale from Mildura after a night of celebration. It was a journey of about eighty kilometres. The Offender was the driver. Of the four others, the deceased was sitting in the backseat behind the front passenger. She was not wearing a seatbelt. The rest were. They were all close friends. The celebration was to mark one of them commencing his long journey from Australia to make his way back to his home in France the next day.

6As the vehicle approached the intersection of Morris Road and the Sturt Highway just west of Euston, New South Wales, the Offender lost control of the vehicle. He swerved to avoid a kangaroo. He overcorrected. The vehicle rolled at least three times, and their friend, the deceased, lost her life; mercifully almost instantly due to injuries suffered when she was thrown from the vehicle. The lives of all involved, including the Offender, have no doubt been scarred forever, although their grief pales against the loss suffered by her family.

7This is a case where yet again individuals in our community ignore the risks attaching to driving motor vehicles dangerously and after imbibing in excessive amounts of alcohol despite the constant efforts of law enforcement agencies and the legislature to try and curb such criminal misconduct. It is against this background that I must sentence the Offender.

8The offence carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. There is no statutory standard non-parole period. The maximum, however, confirms the seriousness of the offence and is reserved for those cases which can be properly characterised as falling within the worst category. The punishment must fit the crime (see R v Veen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465). I take this and other established sentencing practices, both at common law and under the legislation, including reference to those matters identified in ss 3A, 21A, 22, 22A and 23 of the Act where applicable, into account. That is, of course, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This also includes, of course, the application of a process of intuitive or instinctive synthesis as also identified in cases such as Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]. 

9I have taken all these matters into account, some stated and some not. They all form the basis for my decision in the exercise of my discretion as to sentence.

10The Offender has been on bail since the day of the offence, 9 June 2012. He has therefore not served any time in custody other than the short period during arrest, interview and charging. For reasons I will later elaborate upon I have no doubt this would have been both a gruelling and terrifying experience for this young man. Furthermore, I also consider the time spent in Australia awaiting finality of these proceedings has of itself resulted in additional hardship.

11I have received a considerable amount of material from both Crown and defence. These include the Crown sentencing bundle which includes the agreed facts, victim impact statement, and a Corrections Victoria presentence report. From the defence I have received a letter from the mother of the deceased, statements from two of the passengers in the vehicle (extracted from the Crown brief), and two Australian research papers regarding motor vehicle accidents caused by roaming fauna. I have also benefited from comprehensive written submissions from Crown and defence, each of which has been supplemented by further oral submissions. I have also heard oral evidence from the Offender, the poignancy of which cannot be overstated.

12The focus of submissions has properly been directed to not whether a custodial sentence is imposed, but whether upon the imposition of such sentence it be directed to be served in an alternative manner to fulltime imprisonment. The parties agree that this is only possible should an overall sentence of two years imprisonment or less be imposed.

13I have already touched on the facts. I will now expand upon them as are contained in the agreed statement of facts, and for this purpose I will read onto the record paras 1, 2, 3 and 4. 

14Sometime before 9pm on Friday, 8 June 2012, Mattia Minna, drove his white Holden Commodore, Victorian registration YEO 747, from his home in Robinvale, Victoria, to Mildura. Also present in the vehicle were his friends and workmates; Max Fromentou(?), Mahzid Yahi, Kevin Dehenine(?) and Carollynne Olivie. Whilst in Mildura the group attended a number of licensed premises. The Offender and each of the other occupants of the vehicle consumed alcohol throughout the night. 

15When the group returned to the car for the return trip to Robinvale the Offender got into the driver's seat. Max sat in the front passenger seat, Kevin sat in the middle of the rear seat next to his girlfriend, the deceased, who occupied the rear seat on the passenger side. Mahzid sat in the seat behind the driver. Mahzid and Kevin put their seatbelts on. Kevin noted that the deceased did not put her seatbelt on. The back seat passengers were all talking. Mahzid was also sending text messages to a friend throughout the journey. None of the passengers noted anything unusual about the Offender's manner of driving throughout the journey.

16As the vehicle was approaching the intersection of Morris Road and the Sturt Highway about one kilometre west of the township of Euston the Offender lost control of the vehicle causing it to cross onto the incorrect side of the road. In an attempt to avoid coming off the roadway completely the Offender swerved to the left causing the vehicle to become airborne and land on its roof. Whilst the vehicle was airborne the deceased was ejected from the vehicle, landing on the roadway suffering fatal head injuries on impact. Each of the other passengers then exited the car which was on its roof on the roadway. Kevin immediately checked on the deceased and noted that she had suffered significant injuries to the head and face and was not breathing.

17The Offender then ran to Euston Police Station to seek help. By the time he reached Euston Police Station, Police, together with other emergency services, had already been notified of the accident and were responding. The Offender then commenced to run back to the accident scene. He was assisted by rural fire brigade staff who were responding to the accident, and was conveyed back to the scene.

18Later the Offender spoke with Police and subsequent mandatory drug and alcohol testing revealed he had a blood alcohol reading of 0.137 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. This falls in the higher end of midrange under the New South Wales drink driving legislation and is just under the high range limit (0.15 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood) which, if reached or exceeded, would have resulted in a far more serious ""aggravated"" rendition of this offence. After compliance with all proper protocols by arresting Police the Offender participated in an electronically recorded interview with suspected person, that is an ERISP. 

19I return to the facts and [7] and [8]. 

20The Offender participated in the ERISP again with the assistance of the interpreter. The Offender admitted being the driver of the vehicle YEO 747 Victoria at the time of the collision. The Offender said that a kangaroo ran into his path so he turned the steering wheel to avoid hitting it as he wanted to sell the car and had only just undertaken a number of repairs. The Offender stated that he lost control of the vehicle and the car flipped. When the car stopped he was still seated in the driver's seat upside down. The Offender stated that he got out of the vehicle and discovered that everyone else was out of the car and that the deceased was not breathing.

21When asked his level of intoxication the Offender stated that on a scale of one to ten he was about five out of ten (one being sober and ten being very heavily intoxicated). The crime scene examination conducted by the Broken Hill Forensic Services Group revealed that the vehicle had rolled at least three times. 

22They were all close friends brought together from their various overseas countries and homes by a shared youthful love of travel, adventure, and the outdoors. They were sharing, as so many young people of more fortunate backgrounds are able to do, a rite of passage, travel, adventure, and work in a friendly foreign country. All were international travellers visiting and living in the local area. It was a night of celebration for a friend on his way home. The usual practice of selecting a nominated driver was not followed. This Offender tragically took the driver's seat and embarked on the long drive home. They were nearly there when the incident and tragic results occurred.

23The Offender cooperated with Police from the outset. He admitted being the driver and expanded on the circumstances of the incident. He participated in an ERISP. He made full admissions and gave an account that he adheres to in these sentence proceedings. There is no dispute and, indeed, no submission is put to the contrary that this Offender is facing the imposition of a fulltime custodial sentence. This, of course, reflects as I say the objective seriousness of the offence together with the long list or history of binding authorities, some of which that I will refer to shortly.

24The Offender has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. I therefore expressly acknowledge the utilitarian value of that plea and I take it into account. In so doing I acknowledge the principles enunciated in R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1. It is properly conceded by the Crown that the Offender is entitled to the maximum discount of twenty-five per cent from the sentence I would have otherwise ordinarily imposed. 

25By entering the plea this Offender has saved witnesses, now all from overseas, from having to give evidence in no doubt in excruciating circumstances. Furthermore, there is the related and, dare I say, significant cost savings in not having to proceed by way of trial. It is against this background that I consider the guilty plea also provides evidence of contrition. This is a mitigating factor and favours the Offender. From a pragmatic point of view the plea of guilty is also evidence of remorse.

26Furthermore, the early plea entitles me to reduce the sentence to lower than the suggested range. Please see R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Thomas [2007] NSWCCA 269. Please see [161] and [26] respectively.

27The guideline judgments of R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 apply to offences against s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900, that is, dangerous driving occasioning death or grievous bodily harm.

28The guideline judgments indicate that an assessment of the Offender's moral culpability is relevant to determining whether a custodial sentence should be imposed, as well as to determining the appropriate length of sentence. See Whyte at [214] and [229].

29It should be noted that the Court in Whyte was careful not to be unduly prescriptive in setting out a range of sentences of a ""typical case"". The Court made no reference to the upper limits of such a sentence but endeavoured to indicate a lower limit for a typical case below which a sentence would not generally be appropriate. At [229] the Court said:

""The guideline for offences against s 52A(1) and (3) for the typical case identified above should be:

Where the Offender's moral culpability is high a fulltime custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate"".

30It was also stated at [214]:

""A custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the Offender has a low level of moral culpability as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgement"". 

31It is the ""central inquiry with regard to the objective circumstances of the particular offence"". Please see R v Errington (2005) 157 A Crim R 553 at [26].

32In Jurisic, Spigelman CJ as he then was, in setting out the guidelines as to sentencing stated at p 231 para E:

""A non-custodial sentence for an offence against s 52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgement"".

33I am also assisted by the observations of Simpson J in R v Khatter [2000] NSWCCA 32:

""Offences under s 52A are not divided into those of momentary inattention and those of abandonment of responsibility. Those are the two extremes. There are shades and gradations of moral culpability in different instances of the offence, and it is proper for the courts to recognise a continuum, rather than a dichotomy, when assessing moral culpability"".

34In R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 Howie J stated at [21]:

""But the factors in the list set out in Whyte, as indicative of a typical case do not operate as a checklist. The presence or absence of characteristics having some mathematical relationship with the sentence to be imposed. They merely describe the typical case and were not intended to circumscribe the sentencing judge's discretion in the way the applicant suggests. If the applicant does not fall within a typical case for whatever reason, the guideline is of less assistance than it might otherwise have been. The applicant fell outside the typical case of an Offender to be sentenced for dangerous driving for a number of reasons and, therefore, the guideline had less influence upon the exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion"".

35In R v Pisciuneri [2007] NSWCCA 265 it was confirmed at [75]:

""A non custodial sentence for an offence against s 52A is almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgement"". 

36That, of course, adopts that which was said in R v Whyte and R v Jurisic. In R v Whyte a number of typical characteristics were identified in offences such as these. They included:

(i) Young Offender.
(ii) Of good character with no or limited prior convictions.
(iii) Death or permanent injury to a single person.
(iv) The victim is a stranger.
(v) No or limited injury to the driver or the driver's intimates.
(vi) Genuine remorse.
(vii) Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value.

37In the present case the Offender does not conform to the ""typical case"" in two respects. The victim was not a stranger; indeed, she was a close friend, and the plea of guilty does have considerable utilitarian value. That judgment also recited a number of further aggravating factors which are also to be considered. These include:

(i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted.
(ii) Number of people put at risk.
(iii) Degree of speed.
(iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse.
(v) Erratic or aggressive driving.
(vi) Competitive driving or showing off.
(vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk.
(viii) Ignoring of warnings.
(ix) Escaping Police pursuit.
(x) Degree of sleep deprivation.
(xi) Failing to stop.

38Items (iii) through to (xi) have been identified as relating to the moral culpability of the Offender.

39As to these aspects there are only three that I consider relevant. These are (ii), (iv) and (vii). There were, of course, five people in the vehicle including the Offender. The journey was a long one, some 80 kilometres from Mildura to Robinvale. Notably the Offender was almost there. There were no complaints or concerns held or voiced by any of the occupants of the vehicle during the journey. This is corroborated by the statements from two of the passengers tendered by the defence. There is on the other hand significant concern attaching to the blood alcohol reading. It is, as I say, at the high end of the mid range. There were, as I say, another four people put at risk and aside from the deceased, and, of course, other members of the public, other road users.

40There was a clear abandonment of responsibility by the Offender when he chose to drive the vehicle after an evening of drinking and celebration. When spoken to by Police after the incident they noted his affectation although presumably by smell alone rather than by any overt behaviour. The level of intoxication was also assessed by the Offender himself as being five on a scale of one to ten.

41The defence submits some exception or allowance ought be made for a ""foreign"" driver not ensuring one of his passengers was wearing a seatbelt. The deceased was not wearing a seatbelt. Conduct of the victim has been considered by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Dutton [2005] NSWCCA 248 where at [35] the Court considered it inappropriate to regard the conduct of a victim as mitigating the driver's criminal behaviour by putting the public and passengers at risk. In light of this authority I do not accept this submission.

42Submission is also made by the defence to consider in a rather circumspect way the intervention and thus possible contributing cause emanating from the swerve to avoid a kangaroo. I am prepared to accept that there was a kangaroo and that the Offender attempted to avoid it and that he then lost control of the vehicle. This was the version he gave to Police on the night and he said that he did so because the vehicle was in good repair and proposed to be sold. He thus did not want to damage it. This is entirely understandable. The Offender, however, has been in Australia for some considerable time and was experienced in driving in this country. Indeed, for example, he had driven from Mildura to Darwin on one occasion. He had also lived and driven in the Robinvale/Mildura area for some considerable time. He would have been aware of the dangers of fauna at night. 

43He would also be aware of the prohibition against driving motor vehicles with the prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood. He was starkly reminded of this earlier that evening because he was subject to a random breath test before the celebrations began; that very night. When the incident occurred, kangaroo or not, his ability to control the vehicle would have been considerably and adversely affected by the alcohol level in his blood. That to me is the most serious feature of his driving in a manner dangerous.

44The decision to drive a vehicle whilst affected by alcohol, the degree of which is indicated by the subsequent high reading, and embark on such a long journey with a group of similarly affected, if not drunken friends, are also indicators of the seriousness of this offence.

45These are some of the many factors to be considered. Expressions such as ""abandonment of responsibility"" and ""high moral culpability"" are necessarily flexible expressions and hinge on a wide range of factors. In my view this case does not fall within the category of ""typical case"" described in Whyte. There are variances. The aggravating factors listed are illustrative, not definitive of what is capable of constituting ""abandoning responsibility"", and the sentencing guideline is to be treated as a reference point rather than a starting point. Again please see R v Errington at [36] and [50]. In R v Nguyen [2008] NSWCCA 113 the Court stated at [48] reference to the head sentence of three years in Whyte was not prescriptive in all the circumstances and whilst not being exceptional this is a case that falls within the lower range of moral culpability.

46There is no dispute as I say, and no submission to the contrary, that the Offender faces the imposition of a fulltime custodial sentence. As I have said, the tension is whether I am able to impose a sentence that may be served by way of alternative to fulltime imprisonment.

47I must in this exercise be mindful of the reasonable proportionality between the sentence and the circumstances of the crime. The relative importance of the objective facts and the subjective features of every case will vary. Due weight must be given to the objective circumstances. Again I refer to R v Veen (No 2), Mill (1988) 166 CLR 59, and Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594.

48Turning to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This section provides I must take into account the matters referred to in subs (2) ""aggravating factors"", and subs (3) ""mitigating factors"" together with any other objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offence together with any other matters required and/or permitted to be taken into account by the Court.

49As confirmed by the High Court in Muldrock (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [18] this includes the preservation of the entire body of judicially developed sentencing principles which constitute ""law"" for the purposes of s 21A(1) and (4). I am therefore permitted to take into account all factors under the common law that are relevant to the determination of sentence. In consideration of this matter I have done so, whether expressly stated or not.

50I also take into account those factors in ss (2) and (3), aggravating and mitigating factors. I note, without endeavouring to cover the field, the following: 

51As to ss (2) Aggravating, the Crown concedes and I agree there are none. There are other matters but they constitute elements of the offence and I therefore do not take them into account.

52As to ss (3) Mitigating, the Crown concedes and I find:

(e) the Offender does not have any record of previous convictions
(f) the Offender is a person of good character
(k) the Offender entered a plea of guilty.

53As to this latter subparagraph it is noted the plea is also acknowledged and relevant under s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

54It is submitted by the defence and I accept, the following mitigatory factors are also made out on balance of probabilities. These include:

(g) the Offender is unlikely to re-offend.
(h) the Offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, both by reason of his age and his otherwise excellent character. 

55As to (g) and (h) I am of the view this young man has sufficient moral compass and integrity to be completely rehabilitated. Furthermore:

(i) the Offender has shown remorse both by providing evidence that he has accepted full responsibility for his actions and acknowledging the grievous loss arising from the death of Ms Olivie. 

56He, of course, also expresses remorse and sorrow to the family of the deceased and in his evidence before me. He pleaded guilty from the outset and made full admissions to Police. My view is also bolstered by the statement of one of the passengers, Mr Yahi, as to the Offender in his grief, beseeching him to kill him.

57As indicated, without being comprehensive, these are the primary mitigatory factors I accept. 

58I confirm I have also taken into account the provisions of ss (4) and (5) of s 21A. 

59I take into account all the circumstances of the offence and I am ensuring in so doing the Offender is not punished for an offence for which he has not been convicted. See The Queen v Di Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. In so doing I am entitled to consider all the conduct of the Offender including those matters which may aggravate the offence, but I do not take into account those circumstances of aggravation which would have otherwise warranted conviction for a more serious offence.

60The Offender has a nil record both here in Australia and from his home in Italy. He is a young man of excellent character in all respects.

61I have considered relevant Judicial Commission statistics in relation to offences of this nature. It appears as though forty-seven per cent of all Offenders receive sentences of fulltime imprisonment. Of those fitting the profile of this Offender, fifty-four per cent received sentences of fulltime custody. The range of sentences was between two years and six years. Relevant periods of non-parole range between twelve months and forty-two months. Clearly there is a wide range of variables and sentences that must be applied. As has been acknowledged there is no dispute he must receive a gaol sentence.

62Statistics are of limited assistance. In accordance with the judgment of the High Court in Hili and Jones v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [54] which adopted the comments of Simpson J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [303] - [305], and as later confirmed in Holahan v R [2012] NSWCCA 105, statistics assist by establishing the range of sentences imposed. They do not confirm that range as a correct range or that the upper and lower limits are correct. The material does however provide guidance and a yardstick against which I can apply the circumstances of this offence in the sentencing process. The statistics are a blunt tool as they tell me nothing about the circumstances of the offence or the Offender.

63I have received two further statements; one as a victim impact statement within the Crown bundle, exhibit A. It is from the aunt of the deceased. She is the sister of the father. The family live in Belgium. The parents appear separated. The deceased also has an older brother. As the family is overseas I think it is appropriate to read this statement onto the record. The aunty, Ms Lilian Olivie writes as follows:

""My brother Daniel loved his children and only lived for them. He was very sad when his daughter announced she was leaving for a year in Australia. He loved her so much, he is a real daddy. He would often take his daughter into his arms to give her a hug. The happiness of his children is essential for him and that is why he let Carollynne go to Australia.

Daniel is divorced. He has a son, Emanuel, who is twenty-six years old. Emanuel has always been very protective of his little sister. He loved his sister enormously and showed great courage by undertaking to solve a lot of the formalities to repatriate his sister. 

How has the death of Carollynne affected my brother? I can say that the loss of his daughter has destroyed his life and that of his son. He has lost the taste for life. He goes to the office but is unable to work. Daniel doesn't see a counsellor anymore but is under medication. He always says that he doesn't want to have a long life anymore.

The mother of Carollynne and Emanuel is, of course, also very affected and is also under medication. We would like to add that we do not want to load more on Mattia Minna. Our desire is not to destroy his life. We just want to express our heartbreak and how we live without our Carollynne"".

64The defence has also tendered by consent a letter in English and French from the mother of the deceased, Ms Sylvia Angelique Gomes. This letter, as with the former, is overwhelmingly poignant, compassionate and forgiving. Again out of respect I read it onto the record.

""I am the mother of Carollynne Olivie, died in a car accident on 9 June 2012 and for which Mattia Minna is criminalised. I would like to interceded for him because even if my daughter died in the accident I believe it does not deserve a prison sentence. I know that the Australian laws are very strict about alcohol but Mattia did not ingest a quantity which prevented him from having risk of driving at night for tourists in Australia.

It would be more profitable that the boy doing work of general interest to encourage young people to pay attention to the dangers of the road explaining his experiences. Think what it must live every day. It must be on his shoulders the deaths of his friend, Carollynne. His life will never be the same. I hope with all my heart that my application will be heard, because if my mum - I can forgive and hope that the young have a future. I think the Court can make an effort. Thank you"".

65These letters show extraordinary compassion, understanding and forgiveness. Their heartfelt pleas are not overlooked, but I must consider them in light of the law of this State. I accept the submission as both Crown and defence agree, as to the view expressed by Sully J in R v Begbie (2001) 124 A Crim R 300 at [58]:

""I confess that, as presently advised, I do not understand the logic of an approach which excludes rigidly an unforgiving attitude but accepts some weight as being appropriate to be given to a forgiving attitude. In my opinion it is extremely dangerous to suggest any departure of any kind at all from the proposition that the views of the victim's relatives are not to affect substantially one way or the other the framing of a proper sentence"".

66I take the ""forgiving attitude"" into account in my overall consideration but not to the extent of interfering with the proper exercise of my sentencing discretion. I do so as to not ameliorate or aggravate the Offender's culpability or the sentence to which he is justly exposed but to mark the impact of his misconduct and its consequences. I refer of course to R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76, R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510, and R v Dang [1999] NSWCCA 42. The Court views the presentation of the victim impact statements as a compelling reminder of what follows for families who suffer the ultimate unfathomable loss and tragedy, the death of their daughter, sister, niece and friend.

67I have received a presentence report from Victoria Corrections under the hand of Mr Bruce Smythe, Mildura Community Correctional Services dated 22 February 2013. There are no specific sociological problems. He started drinking at the age of nineteen and on this night his consumption of alcohol was an aberration. This is consistent with his evidence that it was a send off for one of his friends. He does not use any illegal drugs. The report confirms his otherwise excellent character, honesty and predisposition for caring for others rather than himself. For example, he states he is more worried for his family than himself if sentenced to gaol. 

68It is also reported that he has telephoned and apologised to the mother of the young lady who died. Compellingly, as I say, she has forgiven him and offered support. This to me is reflective of his genuine character and nobility. It represents a young man who is and will be of benefit to his community wherever he may be. I am informed supervisory options are available through this Service should an alternative to fulltime custody be imposed.

69I have heard evidence from the Offender. He is a young man now aged twenty-three; he will be twenty-four this week. He is a visitor to Australia, having come here in March 2011 as a young tourist and remaining on various working visas. Upon arriving in Mildura he found a home with locals and other young tourists, working in seasonal jobs, much of which is the backbone of the local agricultural industry. He is an amicable, social and positive young man. He comes from Genoa in Italy. He finished high school and was then in regular employment in a pizzeria so as to supplement his semi professional soccer career.

70Rather than go straight to university he, as many young people who are fortunate to do so, chose to travel and experience the wonderment, adventure and learning that can be achieved through independent and self-sufficient travel. He came to Australia as a part of this adventure and to learn English. He ordinarily lives with his mother, father and younger sister in Genoa. His sister is thirteen. She, like most little sisters, looks up to him with affection and admiration. It is she he misses most, and in a selfless way, it is the pain she and his parents will suffer if incarcerated, that he feels most.

71At the time of the incident he was sharing a house with a group of friends in a town called Robinvale. He was working at a local almond factory/orchard. He has a fine record there, having been re-employed after a short absence. That employer supports him to this day and through these proceedings. On the night of the incident he and a group of friends went to Mildura, the closest large centre, to celebrate the departure of one of them, Max, from Australia. He was in the car when the incident occurred. The car was one of shared ownership. It was in good condition, indeed more so because it was about to be sold. The usual practice when going out was apparently that someone would be the designated driver. This did not occur on this night.

72There were five young people in the car. They all went to various hotels and then a nightclub. In the early hours of the morning when preparing to head back the eighty kilometres or so to Robinvale they all hopped in the vehicle and left the driver's seat vacant. The Offender says he was annoyed when this occurred and that no arrangements had been made. He says everyone else was ""really drunk"". It was then he fatefully chose to drive. When questioned why not stay in Mildura he said that they had to get back to Robinvale so their friend Max would be able to depart to Melbourne and then France.

73He says he lost control of the vehicle because a kangaroo leapt in front of the vehicle from his left. He swerved to avoid it, lost control, and, according to forensic evidence, the vehicle rolled at least three times. He broke down with grief almost immediately he entered the witness box. The deceased, as with the other young men, were close friends of his. She was also the girlfriend of Kevin who was in the car. As a consequence of the incident Kevin apparently forfeited his savings that were then kept in the deceased's bank account. The Offender, in an act of generosity and compassion, gave Kevin his entire savings of $2500 to assist him. This has of itself resulted in considerable financial difficulties, particularly as he has not been able to leave Australia pending sentence. This, I accept, has created additional hardship for this Offender in that he has continual difficulty in obtaining employment and continues to be on bail, estranged from his loved ones, family and friends at a time where their solace is most needed. 

74It is now over nine months since the incident and whilst from an administrative point of view the delay is not unacceptable it has, in the unique circumstances attaching to this Offender, had dire emotional consequences. The delay and uncertainty upon entering the plea of guilty and facing sentence together with the loss of a friend has, in my view, resulted in extra curial punishment, and I intend to take this into account.

75He has not told his mother the details of the dire consequences he faces insofar as imminent penalty as he feels this would be too much for her.

76As to extra curial punishment I am of the view that in light of what was said by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Howcher [2004] 146 A Crim R I must also take into account that aspect ""extra curial suffering""; that is, the effect that this crime has brought about on the Offender's own psyche, the effect that it has had on his emotional and intellectual life, the pain and suffering that is caused to him by the death of his friend. In that case after considering Whyte, Hulme J stated at [16]:

""Despite the reference in R v Whyte to the victim being a stranger and the extent of the injury to the driver or persons known to him there is no discussion in that case of the significance of any such event. Nor as a matter of logic does it follow that the fact the victim is not a stranger of itself justify leniency. Rather, it is the case that an Offender's relationship with the victim may be some indication of extra curial suffering flowing from the occurrence"".

77And at [18]:
""I can accept that suffering or the psychological impact on an Offender of what he has done may properly be taken into account by a sentencing judge. Indeed, his Honour said that the applicant was 'entitled to leniency as a consequence of the anguish that he has experienced because of a death of a friend'. And that is an extract from R v Marlin, unreported NSWCCA 10/9/97"".

78There is no doubt in my mind that this Offender will bear responsibility for this tragedy for the rest of his life. He is a young man and having heard evidence from him and in light of the presentence report and his post-incident conduct by contacting the parents and their responses, I consider he will continue to suffer well beyond any sentence imposed by this Court. His grief, remorse, contrition and overwhelming sorry for the death of his friend will be with him forever, and not a day will go by that he does not think of this young woman and his actions.

79Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 sets out the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an Offender. They are:

(a)to ensure that the Offender is adequately punished for the offence
(b)to prevent crime by deterring the Offender and other persons from committing similar offences
(c)to protect the community from the Offender
(d)to promote the rehabilitation of the Offender
(e)to make the Offender accountable for his or her actions
(f)to denounce the conduct of the Offender, and
(g)to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.

80As to subparagraphs (c) and (d) I am confident that nothing further needs to be done to bring these aspects home to this Offender. Furthermore, there is no need in my view to sentence him so as to emphasise specific deterrence. I accept there is minimal need to specifically deter this Offender, but in circumstances such as these general deterrence must be given primacy over considerations personal to the Offender. The message must be conveyed to those in the community that conduct of this type cannot be tolerated despite compelling subjective circumstances. The conduct is of such moment and consequence that there must be condign punishment. It must be denounced and the harm caused recognised.

81Section 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 also requires me to be satisfied that imprisonment is the last resort, and having considered all possible alternatives no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. For the reasons expressed I have come to the view that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. I have, with both concern and compassion, come to the view that such sentence can only be one of fulltime imprisonment.

82Under the provisions of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I am permitted to vary the statutory ratio and extend the period of parole that I find if there are appropriate special circumstances.

83It has been submitted by Mr Maisner on behalf of the Offender that there are special circumstances and that I ought therefore vary the ratio pursuant to that section. The bases for such course are suggested as, essentially, a young Offender and first time in custody. The Crown, with her usual candour and independence, does not oppose such a finding. It is also in my view notable that this Offender will be serving his sentence in a foreign country, a friendly land to which he was a visitor. He is here, thousands of kilometres from home, separated from his parents, his little sister, his grandparents. He is here without the support of any longstanding friends, those we draw upon in times of need. He will not receive the solace of visits by any of them to soften any time he spends in custody. It is also clear to me that the Offender's overall rehabilitation will be facilitated by a longer period of parole.

84A finding of special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact. Please see Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7. I am also mindful of that which was stated by the former CJ Spigelman in R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [20]:
""It is necessary that the circumstances be sufficiently special"".

85I am of the view that in combination there are sufficiently special circumstances to justify such a finding and I propose to do so.

86Would you mind standing up please, Mr Minna?

87The Offender is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of nine months imprisonment commencing today, 25 March 2013 and expiring 24 December 2013.

88I impose a balance of the term of one year and six months imprisonment to commence at the expiration of the non-parole period, that is, 25 December 2013 and expiring 24 June 2015.

89The overall sentence is thus one of two years and three months imprisonment commencing 25 March 2013. The sentence I would have imposed was three years. However, this has been reduced by twenty-five per cent for the early plea.

90I find special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as earlier described: young Offender, first time in custody, need for extended rehabilitation, serving his sentence in the absence of friends and familial support and that he is serving his sentence in a foreign country. These latter aspects will make his custodial period more onerous. The combination of all these factors satisfies me as to a finding of special circumstances and I therefore make that significant adjustment to the statutory ratio.

91Whilst in custody it is directed the Corrective Services Commission assist the Offender as follows:

(a)Obtain urgent counselling and treatment as to his emotional and mental wellbeing, having regard to his youth, the nature of the offence and him being without familial support, and
(b)Obtain access to educational and training programs.

92I also request the Corrective Services Commission act as quickly as possible to classify this Offender. 

93The Offender is to be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period. Such parole is to be subject to the supervision and guidance of the Parole Authority and as provided for in the standard conditions of parole prescribed the regulations of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999.

94Whilst no specific submissions have been made I am of the view that the automatic period of disqualification of three years should be reduced to eighteen months. 

95Was the Offender disqualified or suspended as at the date of arrest?

96ADAMSON: No your Honour. I do note that he did hand in his licence, however.

97HIS HONOUR: All right. Well what I will do, I will make a recommendation that the Commissioner of Roads and Maritime Services take into account any period that he has not been driving, and in particular the fact that he handed in his licence on the day of arrest, that is, 9 June 2012. Accordingly that period should be taken into account pursuant to the provisions of s 205(6)(b) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005. I ask that be taken into account as satisfying a part of the disqualification period.

98Now, are there any matters that either of you wish to raise?

99ADAMSON: Simply the s 166 certificate, your Honour. There was a backup charge of negligent driving. As that was a summary offence it's remained on foot until the conclusion of this sentencing. I seek leave to withdraw that.

100HIS HONOUR: All right. No opposition to the withdrawal of that, Ms Barnes? No opposition to the neg driving being withdrawn?

101BARNES: No. No your Honour.

102HIS HONOUR: All right. That matter is withdrawn and dismissed. Are there any matters that you need to raise with me, Ms Barnes?

103BARNES: No your Honour.

104HIS HONOUR: All right. Crown, nothing you need to raise?

105ADAMSON: Nothing, your Honour.

106HIS HONOUR: Mr Minna, I just have to explain the sentence. The law has required me in the circumstances to impose a sentence of imprisonment. I have imposed a sentence and reduced it to that which I felt I could. I have significantly adjusted the ratio between the parole and non-parole period so that you serve only nine months of imprisonment. You will then be released to parole. When you are released to parole, and I am sure you won't have any trouble, you must not breach that parole. It won't come before me; if you do breach it you'll go before the Parole Authority and go back to gaol for the balance of your parole. Now I anticipate that will not be a difficulty. Do you understand?

107OFFENDER: Yes.

108HIS HONOUR: The fact, however, is that I have sentenced you to gaol for a period of nine months and that will commence today. I have made some specific recommendations that Corrective Services urgently attend to some counselling and treatment just to help you cope with the imposition of that sentence, and particularly the distress that it causes to you. I have also asked that they help you with any education and training programs so as to assist you in doing things whilst you are in custody. I have also asked that they try and classify you; that is, give you the lowest relevant classification that they can as quickly as possible so as to help you get classified and get into a better custodial environment. Do you understand all that? 

109OFFENDER: Yes.

110HIS HONOUR: All right. Look, what I'll do, I'll adjourn. Officers, there is a friend of Mr Minna here just in court on your right. Would you allow a short moment for he and his legal representative just to talk to Mr Minna before he goes downstairs. All right, thank you. I'd be grateful if you'd do that. I thank everyone for sitting on. I apologise it's taken so long.

111And Mr Minna, I hope with all my heart that things work out for you.

		16 July 2013",2013-03-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761165,Scanlon v Sigiriya Capital Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 227,"Judgment
1YOUNG AJ:  These proceedings, between a former employer and employee in the finance industry, are brought to determine which party is entitled to own a valuable parcel of shares.
2Those shares were placed with the plaintiff defeasibly.  The placement was, on the plaintiff's evidence, a bonus being compensation for the alleged fact that he was being paid a salary below his market worth.
3The parties fell out.  The shares concerned rocketed in value due to factors for which neither party can claim credit.  The plaintiff claims that the shares are his.  The defendant claims that because of the happening of certain events, the plaintiff's title determined and that the shares must be revested in it.
4The proceedings were heard by me on 25 and 26 February 2013.  Mr P Kite SC and Mr G Boyce appeared for the plaintiff and Mr V Bedrossian appeared for the defendant.
5Having given a broad outline of what this case is all about, I must now turn to the details.
6The plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking declaratory relief in respect of shares held by the plaintiff in Sirius Minerals plc, a company registered in the United Kingdom with an Australian subsidiary. He also seeks an injunction restraining the defendant from exercising any powers under the Loan Agreement to which I shall shortly refer by reason either of the conversion of the shares under the CREST Transfer Form, or the termination of the plaintiff's employment with the defendant.
7The defendant cross-claims, seeking declaratory relief and an order that the plaintiff (cross-defendant) take the steps necessary to transfer the shares to the defendant (cross-claimant).
8Key facts that are not in dispute include that the defendant is a company incorporated in Australia which carries on business giving advice specialising in investment in natural resources. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as an ""Investment Banking Executive"" under a written contract dated 16 September 2009. He reported to Mr Fraser, who was the Executive Chairman and Managing Director of the defendant.
9On 8 November 2010, the defendant lent AU$47, 500 to the plaintiff under a written contract (the Loan Agreement) for the exclusive purpose of acquiring 2,500 shares in York Potash Ltd, a company registered in the United Kingdom. Counsel on both sides referred to this agreement as a ""golden handcuff"", creating an incentive for the plaintiff to continue his employment with the defendant and perhaps acting as extra compensation in light of a salary which may have been below market levels. The plaintiff acquired the shares under a Share Subscription Deed between himself and York Potash Ltd, also dated 8 November.
10In May 2010, the Fraser Family Trust (which was headed by Mr Fraser and, at the time, the sole member of York Potash) had entered into a memorandum of understanding with Sirius, granting Sirius an option to acquire the entirety of the shares in York Potash in exchange for 150 million Sirius shares. As is clear from its terms, the Loan Agreement contemplated that the 2,500 York Potash shares would be exchanged for the relevant number of Sirius shares.
11Sirius did exercise its option and on 17 January 2011 all persons, including the plaintiff, holding shares in York Potash sold their shares to Sirius in exchange for an allocation of shares in Sirius. The plaintiff received 7, 499, 850 Sirius shares in exchange for the 2,500 York Potash shares.
12Also on 17 January, Mr Fraser was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Sirius.
13Because of an extraordinarily good find of potash off the coast of Whitby, Yorkshire, the shares had a value of about AU$1.6 million in August 2012.  If the plaintiff was entitled to pay out the loan agreement in cash, he would only need to pay about AU$58,575.
14I should now turn to the relevant parts of the Loan Agreement.

(Emphasis added.)
15Sometime in early 2011, the plaintiff was told by the defendant that Mr Fraser would be pursuing his new role with Sirius on a full-time basis, and that the defendant's business activities would be winding down accordingly.
16The plaintiff says (and Mr Fraser gave no evidence so that there is no contrary version) that when both he and Mr Fraser were in London in the week of 17 January 2011, Mr Fraser said to the plaintiff,
""Mate, I have some bad news for you.  I've been talking to the Board.  They have said that I cannot be CEO of Sirius and keep running Sigiriya as well.  I'm sorry, but I am shutting it down.""
17Subsequently, there were discussions with Mr Fraser about the plaintiff taking up employment with Sirius.
18In mid-February of that year, the defendant informed the plaintiff that his employment would be terminated at the end of the month, and that his upcoming salary would be his last. It also requested the plaintiff to sign a Deed of Release absolving the defendant of any outstanding liability towards the plaintiff, which the plaintiff refused to do. The plaintiff has received no salary payments from the defendant since 28 February 2011
19On 9 March 2011 the plaintiff entered into a written contract of employment with Sirius, with the role of ""Manager of Business Development"". The commencement date of the second contract was set as 17 January 2011.
20Later that year, the employment relationship appears to have soured and on 25 November 2011 the plaintiff received an email notifying him that his employment was suspended pending investigation into his conduct and performance. After some correspondence in early to mid December, the plaintiff received a letter from Mr Fraser on the Sirius Australia letterhead which purported to terminate his employment with both Sirius and Sigiriya.
21The letter made several allegations of unsatisfactory conduct, including alleged breaches of the plaintiff's employment obligations, and continued:
In view of the breaches of your employment contracts with both Sirius and Sigiriya, as outlined above and in my letter dated 6 December 2011, I have decided to terminate your employment with both Sirius and Sigiriya. This decision is fully supported by the Boards of both companies.
As a result of the termination of your employment contract with Sigiriya, the following provisions of clause 5 of the Loan Agreement executed on 8 November 2010 become operative:
5.2 In the event of an early termination, repayment of the Loan may only be achieved as follows:
(b) should Early Termination occur after the one year anniversary of the Drawdown Date, by the Borrower delivering:
i. cash in an amount equivalent to the figure calculated as the Early Termination Service divided by the Loan Term, then multiplied by the Amount Owing; andii. clear and unencumbered title to that number of the Shares, representing a proportion of the total number of the Shares, calculated as the Early Termination Shortfall divided by the Term Loan, then multiplied by the total number of the Shares
to the Lender or its nominee, and issuing an irrevocable transfer notice to York Potash or to Sirius, or both, as the case may be, to have the Borrower's name on the relevant share register removed and replaced in favour of the Lender or its nominee in respect of the proportion of the Shares as calculated pursuant to sub-clause 5.2(b)(ii).
5.3 In consideration for entering into this Agreement, the Borrower irrevocably appoints the Lender to be its attorney for the purposes of executing and delivering, in the name of the Borrower, all documents required to be executed and delivered by the Borrower under any portion of clause 5.2.
You will receive a separate letter in relation to repayment of the Loan.
22Mr Fraser's reliance on clause 5.2(b) as opposed to clause 5.2(a) is consistent with the letter's attempted termination of the plaintiff's employment with the defendant as of 23 December 2011. 
23However, it is now not in dispute that his employment with the defendant took place by agreement sometime at the end of February or in early March of 2011.  If that letter had any validity, the relevant clause is therefore 5.2(a), the plaintiff's termination being prior to the one-year anniversary of the Drawdown Date being 8 November 2012. 
24Through a letter dated 30 December 2011 by his solicitors, the plaintiff disputed, inter alia, the basis for his termination, or the allegation that his employment with the defendant continued after 28 February 2011, and the defendant's right to act under either clause 5.2 or 5.3 of the Loan Agreement.
25The plaintiff's view as to the timing of the termination must be correct as it is now admitted that the employment ceased on 28 February 2011. 
26Before turning to the rival submissions, I must set out the facts concerning the plaintiff's dealings with JP Morgan.
27Although JP Morgan is popularly known as a prominent United States Finance House, the evidence in the present case shows that, actually, a person dealing with ""JP Morgan"" will probably be dealing with a separate corporation merely licensed to use the name JP Morgan and trading to some extent under the aegis and control of the American company.  However, no point was taken in the case on this matter by either party.
28The plaintiff had a prior association with a senior officer of JP Morgan.  He made use of this association to open an account with JP Morgan and also to obtain credit so that he could trade in shares with JP Morgan.
29The plaintiff gave evidence that he has the qualifications of Master of Financial Economics from Oxford and Master of Management from Cambridge. However, when cross-examined on the JP Morgan documents, one would not think that he showed any proper appreciation of the legal issues involved.
30The JP Morgan entity which whom the plaintiff opened an account was Bear Stearns.  The ""Customer Service Agreement"" in clause 3 provided that each JP Morgan entity was given a lien and continuing security on all property carried or controlled through any JP Morgan entity.
31I will now turn to the rival submissions. The plaintiff's basic case is that there was no ""Early Termination"" of his employment with Sigiriya which would entitle the defendant to seek delivery of the Sirius shares pursuant to clause 5.2(a). 
32Furthermore, although there is no doubt that the plaintiff converted his Sirius shares from certificated to uncertificated form and that that involved transferring them to JP Morgan to be held in a brokerage account, the plaintiff argues that this did not amount to a ""Disposal"" or other proscribed dealing which would entitle the defendant to succeed.
33In the alternative, the plaintiff argues that the reliance on clause 5.2(a) and/or the exercise of the discretion as to whether to apply it by the defendant is contrary to implied terms of good faith and reasonableness.
34The defendant argues that the termination by agreement which occurred in early 2011 falls within the definition of ""Early Termination"". It also argues that the conversion of the Sirius shares constitutes a ""Disposal"" or other proscribed dealing entitling it to seek delivery up of the shares.
35The defendant further argues that any implied term of good faith and/or reasonableness has been excluded in this case. In the alternative, the actions of the defendant are not contrary to such an implied term.
36I should note here that the thought crossed my mind the case would include an application for relief against forfeiture. The core complaint of the plaintiff appears to be that relinquishing the shares would amount to a windfall to the defendant which is unjustifiable in comparison with the actual prejudice suffered by reason of any alleged breach.  However, despite prompting, no such case was attempted.  Thus I can put that thought aside.
37For the same reason I need not consider whether the plaintiff's agreement with JP Morgan is valid or void for uncertainty, or whether there is a security interest in NSW which has not be stamped under the Duties Act 1997.
38Accordingly, I need to adjudicate on the following points which I now consider.  As they are all interrelated, I need to deal with them in groups, which I will do under the following heads:
A.  Questions of liability
1. Has there been an ""Early Termination"" within the meaning of the Loan Agreement?2. Has there been a ""Disposal"" of the ""Shares"" within the meaning of the Loan Agreement in breach of clause 10.2?3. Has there been a dealing with the shares in breach of clause 14.1 of the Loan Agreement?4. Has there been an ""Event of Default"" within the meaning of the Loan Agreement?
B. Can the plaintiff nonetheless resist delivery up of the shares?
If the answer to any of the questions in Part A is ""Yes"", whether the plaintiff is nevertheless entitled to resist delivery up of the Sirius shares. This requires consideration of the following matters:
1. Does the Loan Agreement contain an implied term of good faith   and/or reasonableness?2. If so, is reliance by the defendant on any right, power or discretion to seek delivery of the shares contrary to that implied term?3. Accordingly, whether the plaintiff is obliged, under the Loan Agreement, to transfer the shares to the defendant.
C.   What is the result of the litigation?
39A.  As noted above, ""Early Termination"" is defined in the Loan Agreement as covering at least two distinct situations, viz:
(1) `where the Borrower terminated its employment contract with the Lender; and(2) where the contract is terminated by the Lender due to a breach of that employment contract by the Borrower.   
I must examine each of these possibilities in turn.
40The underlying question is this: how did the plaintiff's employment come to an end?
41The plaintiff says that he was employed by the defendant between 21 September 2009 and about 28 February 2011.  He pleads that the termination was by operation of law (by which he means he accepted a repudiation by the defendant) and alternatively by agreement.
42The defendant says that the employment was terminated by agreement on or about 28 February 2011 and that such termination was a termination by the Borrower under the definition of Early Termination.
43I accept that the view taken by each side that termination by agreement is the correct analysis.  However, the second part of the defendant's proposition is difficult to accept. 
44It is clear that termination of a contract by agreement is properly analysed by one or both parties proposing that the agreement be terminated and the other concurring.  The consideration for the agreement is the mutual promises (usually implied) to release the other party from further performance, see e.g. Chitty on Contracts, 29th ed (2004); Tullett Prebon (Australia) Pty Ltd v Purcell [2008] NSWSC 852 (Brereton J) at [27].
45The only reasonable way of construing the first part of the definition of Early Termination is to distinguish between two (or perhaps three) situations.  First, it may be the employer could terminate the employment in some circumstances without cause; secondly, the employee could elect to terminate; and thirdly, the employer could terminate for breach.  It is only in situations two or three that there would be early termination.
46Indeed, as Mr Kite submits, whilst there may be various ways in which the termination of the employment might come to an end, the contract only picks up two of these that can lead to a finding of Early Termination, which can be loosely expressed: (1) where the employee initiates the termination and (2) where the employee's conduct gives rise to termination by the employer. 
47I find it impossible to accept the general proposition that if an employee consents to a termination of employment, even if it is the employee who first raises the proposition, that the employee has terminated the employment.  Further, I know of no authority which supports such a proposition, nor has one been cited to me. 
48In discussion, Mr Bedrossian said that it would be absurd if an employee said that he or she wishes to terminate the employment and the employer said, ""Okay"" that it would not be a termination by the employee.
49In the example given by Mr Bedrossian that might be so because the employer was a mere recipient of the employee's expression of desire to terminate and merely acquiesced.  However, that is not this case.  In this case, the employer was reluctantly shutting down its business and both parties wished their relationship to continue under some new arrangement.
50Thus I do not find the first part of the definition of Early Termination established.
51I now turn to the second part of the definition. This requires consideration as to whether there has been a breach.  I will deal with these matters below.  However, there is one preliminary issue I must deal with now.
52The definition of Early Termination uses the significant words ""due to"" in the phrase ""terminated by the Lender due to a breach of that employment contract by the Borrower"". 
53I put to Mr Bedrossian that the words ""due to"" must mean that his client must rely on the breach to justify termination.  His reply was (T80) ""I think that's a fair construction of that part of the document.""
54Indeed, the plaintiff's counsel's original written submission made the point that, whatever the analysis, the termination did not occur as a result of anything the plaintiff initiated or did.
55Especially remembering that the employee may forfeit considerable benefits on early termination, the clause should be construed strictly and the words ""due to"" given due work to do.
56Thus, on the evidence, was the termination of employment ""due to"" the plaintiff's breach of the Employment Contract?
57It takes a while to realise that, on the pleadings as amended and on the common ground that the employment ceased on 28 February 2011, one must ask what was the cause of the termination as at 28 February 2011.
58Clearly as at the relevant time the defendant did not appreciate that there had been a breach of cl 14.1. The termination was not due to that breach.  Thus one must focus on the alleged breach to do with disposal of the shares.
59I now must look at the two transactions which are said to constitute a disposal and ask myself whether they occurred, whether they were a breach of the employment contract and whether the termination of that contract on 28 February 2011 was due to either of them.
60I will first consider whether the plaintiff's dealing with his shares involved a disposal as defined.
61The word ""disposal"" may have different shades of meaning in different contexts.
62As noted above, the word is defined in the Loan Agreement cl 10(2)(c).  That definition contains the rather odd phrase, for lawyers, ""or take any similar economic action"".  Whilst that expression obviously is meant to cover a transaction which has similar economic effect to an assignment or encumbrance, I find it difficult to conceive a particular transaction which would come within these words.
63However, the definition shows that the word ""disposal"" is used in a very wide sense.  It obviously covers divesting of any interest in the shares, thus the use of the word ""encumber"".  The reason for this is quite clear. If certain events occur, the defendant wants to take full title to the shares free from any encumbrance.
64The plaintiff says that merely because he transferred the shares in to the CREST scheme to hold for him, this does not mean he has entered into a transaction of similar economic effect to an assignment or a mortgage. 
65However, that is the least of his problems.
66There was considerable evidence given as to the plaintiff's dealings with the broker JP Morgan.  I have detailed some of those dealings earlier in these reasons.
67The evidence shows that from mid October 2009 the plaintiff was in discussions with JP Morgan with respect to opening a credit brokerage account.
68The standard form of the JP Morgan Customer Agreement clearly provides for liens to be held by members of the JP Morgan group over shares involved and this would include the shares the subject of these proceedings.
69It is clear that the plaintiff did enter into such an arrangement with JP Morgan, probably in the last couple of months of 2009, and that when he obtained the certificate for the shares, they became subject to the lien. 
70This was an encumbrancing of the shares and thus a disposal.
71That being so, it appears that there was an Event of Default within the meaning of clause 11, subject to any problems that may be involved with the lender complying with either (i) or (ii) of 11.1(c).
72Here I find a difficulty which was not really addressed in submissions.  Cl 11 writes in to there being an Event of Default that the employer is to either declare that the default is beyond remedy or to give the employee time to remedy it.
73In actuality, the employer did neither.  Eventually Mr Fraser wrote his letter of December 2011.  This hardly qualified under cl 11: all it seemed to do was to say that so many months had passed that the alleged breaches could not be remedied.  This could not qualify as a reaction by the employer under cl 11 which was necessary before there could be an Event of Default.
74Clause 10(2)(a) forbids the creation of any security interest.  The supplementary bundle of documents and the cross-examination of the plaintiff on the JP Morgan documents show again a breach in that JP Morgan did achieve security over the plaintiff's shares. However, again, cl 11 is applicable before there is an Event of Default.
75Mr Kite objects to this on the basis that default under 10(2)(a) was never pleaded.  Mr Bedrossian admits it was not pleaded but says that there was no evidence of it until the supplementary documents were produced.
76Mr Bedrossian sought leave to amend, but I did not consider that necessary as the question was whether there was a default and the particular default was really of little moment. 
77It may thus not be necessary to consider also whether the transfer to CREST was also a disposal, but, in view of possibility of problems with cl 11 and the fact that the High Court requires first instant judges to deal with all major issues, I must briefly deal with it.
78The evidence is that in February 2011, the plaintiff approached his contact at JP Morgan to enquire about registering his shares in a brokerage account.  His friend prepared and asked the plaintiff to sign a form transferring his shares to CREST.  He did so.  He says that he was unaware that by doing that, the shares would be registered in JP Morgan's name.
79Expert evidence was received that the CREST transfer would not alter the beneficial ownership of the shares.  I accept this, though subject to the effect of the JP Morgan Customer Service Agreement.
80However, whether the beneficial interest was affected or not, is of little  moment.  The plaintiff covenanted not to transfer the shares and he did so.  He did so because it was a step along the way to him having an account with JP Morgan with substantial credit so that he could possibly make megadollars in share trading.  Despite his high qualifications as a Master of Business, it seems that the downside of the transaction did not occur to him.
81The attempt to rely on the phrase ""or take any similar economic action"" cannot alter this.  That phrase means that not only is a transfer a breach but so also is any other dealing with the same economic effect.  It does not mean that a transfer to a nominee which does not change the beneficial interest is exempt from being a proscribed dealing.
82The CREST transaction took place on 24 February 2011. There was hardly time for it to become known to the defendant before 28 February and indeed, there is no evidence that it did.
83In any event, under cl 11 the employer would have had to give an opportunity to remedy the breach before it could rely on it.
84The only evidence of the Lender's reaction is Mr Fraser's letter of 5 February 2013 (Court Book p 537). That letter relies on the breach by making the Transfer to CREST either under cl 10 or under 14.1.  The reason why the JP Morgan matter was not mentioned was that it only became known when the plaintiff provided documents shortly before the hearing.
85Curiously, it must follow that, as the breach was not known on 28 February 2011, it cannot be that the termination was due to it.
86I should note that another possible Event of Default might have occurred under cl 11.1(k).  Although there is brief mention of this in the defendant's submissions this was not developed.  The point is that as the plaintiff had undertaken not to encumber his shares and had done so, he had not adhered strictly to his undertaking and so had brought about an Event of Default which was not subject to the proviso of a notice to remedy being given though it led to the defendant being invested with various options.
87This however gets nowhere because the defendant did not exercise any of the options given to it under cl 11.2, but rather elected in Mr Fraser's letter of December to allege an early termination and rely on cl 5. 
88To conclude, the facts show that the termination was due to the closure of the business of the defendant and to the rearrangement of the affairs of the parties following the Sirius Board requiring Mr Fraser to quit the defendant's business.
89Thus, it has not been established that the termination of the plaintiff's employment with the defendant was due to breaches by the plaintiff.
90I realize that in many situations once a notice of default is given it does not matter that it states the wrong breach or does not state an available breach.  This principle is of no comfort to the defendant where it needs to show that the employment was terminated due to specific causes. 
91It follows that the plaintiff is entitled to succeed on the ultimate issue.
92B. In view of my consideration of the previous matter, this question becomes of no significance.  However, as it was raised as a major issue, I must briefly consider it in case this case goes further.
93The plaintiff says that in this State, implied terms of good faith and reasonableness are accepted as legal incidents of commercial contracts.
94Mr Kite says that the purpose of the agreement is clear.  It was to provide a mechanism to encourage the plaintiff to continue in the defendant's employment. He puts that that purpose is virtually nullified if the defendant is enabled at will deprive the plaintiff of the benefit of the agreement.
95Mr Bedrossian does not dispute that, ordinarily, implied terms as to good faith and reasonableness are implied into commercial contracts.  However, he puts that there are a number of substantial reasons why no such term should be implied in the present case.
96Mr Bedrossian put that the plaintiff has failed to establish that any terms ought to be implied because:
(a) the Loan Agreement expressly excludes the implication of terms;(b) the terms sought to be implied would operate inconsistently with the express terms of the Loan Agreement;(c) in any event the terms sought to be implied do not satisfy the requirements for implication in fact or in law.
97In my view, the submissions in (a) and (b) above are correct (I say nothing about (c)). It was fundamental to the Loan Agreement that the shares be kept completely intact. To this end, the document was replete with statements that undertakings of the plaintiff were to be strictly honoured (cl 11.1(k)); that any implied terms, including those which directly or indirectly adversely affected the defendant's rights, were excluded (cl 16.4); and that if the defendant's consent were required it could withhold it in its absolute discretion (cl 18.2).
98As I have said, this issue is irrelevant to my decision, but, had I to rule on it, I would rule adversely to the plaintiff for the reasons just noted.
99C. It follows that the plaintiff is entitled to relief on his claim and that the defendant's cross claim must be dismissed.
100One other matter must be mentioned.  Mr Fraser swore a defence on behalf of the defendant and later swore an amended defence which was partially inconsistent with the former.
101The clear inference is that both versions of the defence cannot be correct and that there is a real probability that some false swearing is involved.
102Swearing a defence is a solemn occasion and the law expects that people will not put their oaths to the correctness of a defence or other pleading without being sure that what they swear to is the truth.
103Thus, ordinarily, where I see that there are inconsistent sworn pleadings by the same person my duty is to request the Registrar to refer the matter to the police. I should note that this situation only occurs in very few cases.
104However, this is not done until after the case is concluded for two reasons. First, usually opposing counsel will be using the fact of inconsistent verified pleadings in cross-examination. Secondly, an opportunity must be given to the alleged false swearer to explain and the hearing should not be interrupted by this side issue.
105In the instant case, Mr Fraser did not give evidence so the first matter is not a consideration.  However, he must be given 30 days to explain why the papers should not be sent to the police. 
106I should stand the matter over for short minutes to be brought in by the plaintiff.  I would think that the proper orders are to make declarations in terms of prayers 1, 2 and 4 of the summons and perhaps a declaration that the plaintiff is at liberty to repay the loan by a cash payment.  The cross claim must be dismissed and the defendant cross claimant pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.

		19 November 2013",2013-03-25 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761175,Pali v R [2013] NSWCCA 65,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  The applicant, Mr Kevin Pali, is presently serving a sentence of imprisonment consequent upon his conviction on one count of break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence, namely assault occasioning bodily harm, in circumstances of aggravation and one count of robbing the victim of the assault of an amount of $125 in cash.
2With respect to the first count, being an offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), Judge Conlon SC, imposed a sentence involving a non-parole period of five years to date from 17 September 2011 with an additional term of one year and eight months, to expire on 16 May 2018.  For the robbery, the sentencing judge imposed a wholly concurrent term involving a non-parole period of three years with an additional term of one year.  The applicant is therefore serving an effective minimum custodial term of five years, which will expire on 16 September 2016.  That sentence matched the standard non-parole period for an offence under s 112(2), being five years, with an additional term equivalent to one-third of the non-parole period, in accordance with s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"").
3For reasons set out below, no error has been identified on the part of the sentencing judge.  The sentences were, however, sufficient to warrant an application for leave to appeal.  Accordingly, leave should be granted to appeal against each sentence, but the appeals dismissed.
Circumstances of offending4The attack occurred on 17 September 2011, at the victim's unit in Bulli.  He was 69 years of age, suffered some paralysis down his right side resulting from polio in his childhood and also a mild intellectual disability.  He had been known to the offender for approximately six years and to the offender's mother for a longer period.  In the two years prior to the incident, both the offender and his mother assisted the victim with shopping and other errands, for which they were paid.  However, requests were made for money for other reasons and on numerous occasions the victim acceded to those requests.  According to the trial judge, the victim ""tired of being imposed upon in this way"".  The judge continued:
""On 17 September 2011 at about 10.30am the victim was seated at a small table adjacent to the front window and door of his living room.  His life was rather regimented and it was usual for his lunch to be delivered at about that time.  Indeed, he had just commenced to eat his lunch when the offender appeared at the front door that was open, but the screen security door was locked.  The offender said, 'What's going?'  The victim replied with words to the effect, 'Piss off, I don't want to talk to you'.""  Upon consideration of the victim's evidence, I am satisfied that he took this stance as he did not want the offender to prevail upon him any longer requesting money.  The victim said the offender became agitated and demanded to be let in.  The victim told him to go away.  The offender has then pulled the fly screen from the front window, opened it and climbed through onto the table at which the victim was sitting.  He then pushed the victim in the chest area, causing him to stumble backwards.  There was a scuffle and the victim was punched to the head area.  The victim acknowledged that he threw a couple of punches at the offender attempting to defend himself.  The offender has then removed a wallet from the victim's rear pocket, took the $125 in cash out of it and threw the wallet on the table.  The offender then left via the front screen door.""
5The victim suffered swelling and bruising to the left side of his face in the course of the incident, which the sentencing judge described as ""a cowardly attack on an elderly man with physical disabilities and from my observations of him in the witness box, some mild intellectual deficit.""
6A pre-sentence report prepared on 1 May 2012 described the applicant in the following terms:
""Mr Pali is a 42 year old male who appears to have had a dysfunctional childhood marred by periodic violence during his formative years.  It appears that his exposure to violence at an early age has characterised his own behaviours and been a significant factor within his own relationships and his offending behaviour.  His transient lifestyle appears to have exposed him to the subculture of illicit substances and anti-social peers.
...
He has openly acknowledged that his epilepsy and illicit substance use has impacted on his ability to maintain employment.  Of concern is Mr Pali's denial of the offence and the claims the offence and injuries were fabricated and self-inflicted.""
7With respect to drug use, the sentencing judge made the following findings:
""He commenced using cannabis at age 16, he did not commence using amphetamines until his early 30s.  He started using heroin about four years ago.  He advised that he had not engaged in any periods of abstinence nor participated in any drug or alcohol interventions.""
8With respect to his continued denial of involvement in the offences, the trial judge expressed concern for his prospects of rehabilitation, describing the prosecution case as overwhelming.  He found there was ""no contrition or remorse"".
9The applicant had a criminal record for stealing and assaults dating back to 1984, when he was dealt with in the Children's Court.  In 2009 he was twice convicted for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and once for assault police in the execution of their duty.  In between, there were numerous offences of a like kind, although his record was clear for approximately eight years in the 1990s.  The sentencing judge concluded that his criminal record ""is not one that would entitle him to leniency.""
Grounds of appeal10The applicant sought to raise two grounds of appeal: the first asserted that the sentencing judge had failed to take into account a mitigating factor, namely that the offences were not part of a planned or organised criminal activity in the terms identified in s 21A(3)(b) of the Sentencing Procedure Act.  The second ground was that each of the sentences was manifestly excessive.
11The first complaint is without substance.  The Sentencing Procedure Act identifies an offence which was part of a planned or organised activity as involving an aggravating factor and one which was not as involving a mitigating factor.  On a superficial reading, these appear to be alternative findings, one of which must be made in every case, so that a failure in any case to refer to one or the other must involve error.  That would not be correct, for two reasons.  The first is that the trial judge might not be satisfied on the applicable standards of proof that either was established.  The second reason is that in some cases the factor will be of little if any significance and will therefore not be relied upon by either party.  This case at least fell into the latter category, if not the former.  Neither in written submissions, nor orally, did the applicant's representative rely on this factor in the Court below.  It has been noted on more than one occasion, both in this Court and in the Victorian Court of Appeal, that generally there will be no erroneous failure to take into account a ""relevant consideration"" in circumstances where it has not been identified and relied upon before the trial judge: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [77]-[82] (Johnson J, McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreeing); Romero v R [2011] VSCA 45; 206 A Crim R 519 at [11].  In the latter case, Redlich JA stated (with the agreement of Buchanan and Mandie JJA):
""In sentencing appeals, this Court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment.  It is not a rehearing of the plea in mitigation.  It is not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below.  Given the nature of its supervisory role, this Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been, but were not advanced on the plea.  It will have an even greater reluctance to entertain arguments that seek to resile from concessions made below or are a contradiction of the submissions previously made.  The revivification of arguments abandoned or eschewed on the plea is highly undesirable and should not be countenanced, save where fresh evidence is adduced, or in the exceptional circumstance where it can be shown that there was most compelling material available on the plea that was not used or understood and which demonstrates that there has been a miscarriage of justice arising from the plea and sentence.""
12This statement of principle is not inconsistent with the obligations imposed on the sentencing court by s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act.  Nor was the principle evaded by the suggestion that the point now sought to be raised was ""obvious"", on the basis that the evidence supported the inference that the applicant's conduct was spontaneous and impulsive and, in that sense, unplanned.
13If such a finding of fact were to be relied upon, it should have been sought.  Nor was it self-evidently available.  The applicant did not give evidence and there was, therefore, no direct evidence to support the inference relied upon.  Further, in the case of a person whose drug habits would appear to require access to ready cash, whose state of mind from time to time may have been affected by drugs and who had a criminal record for violent conduct, both the nature of his intentions at the relevant time and the extent to which they mitigated the seriousness of the offending were matters inviting debate.
14There is no substance in this ground and it should be rejected.
15The second ground was that the penalties for each offence were manifestly excessive.  The offence under s 112(2) carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of five years.  The sentencing judge fixed a period which conformed to the standard non-parole period.  To take that step without regard to the particular circumstances of the case and other relevant sentencing principles would demonstrate error: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.  However there was no suggestion that the sentencing judge acted erroneously in that respect.  Even absent such an error, and accepting that the objective seriousness of the offence was in the middle of the range for such offences, there may yet be error in imposing a sentence in conformity with the standard non-parole period.  Nevertheless, the guidance provided by the standard non-parole period is itself a significant factor to be taken into account in determining, on appeal, whether the sentence imposed fell within an appropriate range.
16The primary basis for the challenge involved reliance upon the Judicial Commission statistics for offences of a like kind.  
17Of the precedents relied upon by the applicant, three should be addressed.  Most recently, the Court interfered with a sentence which, once allowance is made for the fact that a discount was given for an early plea of guilty, was in the same range as that in the present case: Bolt v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 50.  The error identified in that case, which was determined before judgment was delivered in Muldrock in the High Court, was the adoption of a two-stage process which gave undue weight to the standard non-parole period.  However, the basis for imposing a lesser sentence involved an assessment of ""the circumstances of this particular offender"" at [39] (McCallum J, Beazley JA and Harrison J agreeing).  The applicant was aged 19 at the time of the offence, had a life described as one of ""abject grief, hardship and deprivation"", had become a father as a teenager ""when substance abuse and mental illness were already substantial problems for him"", but who had ""good prospects of rehabilitation"": [40]-[41].  The inference to be drawn is that, absent those circumstances, the Court would not have intervened.  Those factors were not replicated in the present case.
18R v Terkmani [2009] NSWCCA 142; 195 A Crim R 298 involved a frightening incident in which two men came to the door of the victim's home, looking for another occupant, who was away.  Despite being repeatedly advised of that fact, the offender threw a brick through the window of the house, produced a knife and climbed in.  He then demanded that the victim open the door for his accomplice.  Both men started punching the victim with their fists; they continued to assault him when he fell to the ground.
19The offender was found guilty by a jury.  He was sentenced to four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years.  The prosecution appealed against the inadequacy of the sentence.  Again there were factors personal to the offender which appeared to have weighed strongly in his favour.  Like Mr Bolt, he was 19 years of age; he also enjoyed considerable family support, a good employment history and strong work and family ethics, which led to a finding that he had good prospects of rehabilitation: at [41]-[42].  Although the Court did not interfere, Price J (with whom Grove and Buddin JJ agreed) noted that ""the sentence imposed by the judge was lenient and was probably influenced by his Honour's misunderstanding of the maximum penalty"", described the sentence as one which he would not himself have imposed at first instance, but was not persuaded that it was ""definitely outside"" the appropriate range: at [47].  Again, it is tolerably clear that the Court would have intervened to increase the sentence, absent the personal circumstances of the offender noted above.
20The third case relied upon by the applicant involving a jury verdict after a not guilty plea was Ngati v R [2008] NSWCCA 3; 180 A Crim R 384.  The victim of the attack was a woman who lived with her family in a house at Airds.  She had apparently exchanged words with a child who had spoken to her in an insulting way and had then spoken to the child's mother.  The child was a friend of one of the offender's children.  The offender and his family came around to the victim's house, entered by kicking out the glass in a window and the offender's wife and one or other of his children assaulted the victim.  The case against the offender was not that he struck the victim, but that he was present, encouraging or assisting or standing by ready to assist those members of his family who did assault the victim.  The primary appeal was against conviction, the issue for the jury having been whether the offender entered the house of the victim.  That appeal was rejected.  The offender had been sentenced to a term of three years and nine months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of two years.  The appeal against the harshness of the sentence was dismissed as being of ""no substance"": at [42] (Barr J, Tobias JA and Hidden J agreeing).  The principal basis of challenge appeared to have been a question of parity, but the offender's wife had pleaded to a much less serious offence and other members of his family were dealt with in the Children's Court, removing any real basis for that ground.  The fact that the appeal was dismissed gives little basis for comparison with the present case.
21Despite the large number of charges laid under s 112(2), virtually all of which have resulted in guilty pleas, there is little assistance to be derived from the statistics or specific precedents.  In particular, the unfavourable personal circumstances of the applicant removed a basis for leniency of the kind reflected in the cases set out above.  The challenge to the appeal against the sentence for the offence under s 112(2) must be rejected.
22The sentence for the robbery received limited attention in the applicant's submissions, no doubt because it was wholly absorbed within the concurrent sentence imposed under s 112(2).  It was not suggested that a non-custodial sentence should have been imposed, but that a four year sentence with a non-parole period of three years was excessive.  The offence carried a maximum penalty of 14 years, but was clearly not a serious offence of its kind.  That fact was, arguably, reflected in the sentence being less than 30% of the maximum, despite the applicant's lengthy record of offences of stealing and other unfavourable personal circumstances.  
23It may be accepted that the statistics indicate that this is a sentence towards the top of the range of sentences imposed for this offence, but the specific examples provided for the applicant all involved pleas of guilty, with no indication as to the discount given.  These statistics alone do not provide a basis for concluding that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  The appeal against the sentence imposed on the robbery count should also be rejected.
Conclusion - orders24The appropriate orders are:
(1) Grant leave to the applicant to appeal against each of the sentences imposed by the District Court on 10 May 2012.
(2) In respect of each sentence, dismiss the appeal.
25SIMPSON J:  I agree with Basten JA.
26BLANCH J:  I agree.

2761182,SMITH v R [2013] NSWCCA 64,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
Offence and sentence
The appellant was tried before Buddin J and a jury in the Supreme Court at Sydney between 30 May and 7 July 2011. The indictment presented at trial pleaded a single count that on 3 June 1995 at Fairfield he murdered Russell Lyons. The count pleaded an offence contrary to s18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for life.

2On 7 July 2011 the jury found the appellant guilty of murder on that count. On 17 August 2011 Buddin J sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years, commencing 30 April 2010 and expiring 29 April 2022, with a balance of term of 6 years expiring 29 April 2028.

3On 16 September 2011 a Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on behalf of the appellant. Thereafter, two extensions of that notice were granted. On 8 November 2012 a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal against Conviction was filed. Two grounds of appeal were notified:

Ground 1: ""The verdict was unreasonable"".
Ground 2: ""The trial judge erred in the direction to the jury with respect to the witness Mr Cross"".

The Crown case at trial and witnesses

4The case against the appellant was that, at about 3.30am on 3 June 1995, he was involved in an initial altercation with the deceased on a street called ""The Crescent"" in Fairfield, after trying to steal his wallet. During that initial altercation, three men who were described as ""Maoris"" or ""Islanders"" became involved. One of them, who was described as having ""dreadlocks"" assaulted firstly the appellant and then the deceased. After this altercation, the deceased ran some distance to a car-park, followed by the appellant. The appellant caught up with him, assaulted him and inflicted a head injury that resulted in his death. The Crown contended that the appellant intended to cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased, or that he caused the deceased's death while committing a crime punishable by 25 years imprisonment.

5There was no direct evidence that the appellant killed the deceased. The case against him was entirely circumstantial and was based on the following evidence.

(a) DNA evidence 
A short distance away from where the body of the deceased was found (without any shoes on his feet) the police found some discarded Adidas running shoes on the awning of a shop which had blood on them. The shoes were well worn. DNA testing on the blood matched it to the deceased. In addition, DNA samples taken from inside the shoes were ultimately matched to the appellant in 2008 (his DNA was not held by the authorities until his arrest for a minor offence in 2007).

6It was the prosecution case that these shoes had belonged to the appellant, but that he had discarded them after stealing the shoes of the deceased which were never recovered. Further, DNA samples taken from the inside rear pocket of the deceased's pants, were also matched to the appellant in 2009. DNA from a stain above the rear pocket was matched to the appellant. It was the Crown case that the DNA from the appellant was deposited when he stole the deceased's wallet from his pocket, which was also never recovered.

(b) Expert podiatry evidence
An expert podiatrist, Dr Bennett, gave evidence regarding similarities in the wear patterns of the Adidas running shoes and a pair of thongs seized from the appellant in 2009 and regarding similarities in the wear patterns of the Adidas running shoes and plaster casts/impressions taken from the appellant's feet in 2009. He testified that there were features of the impressions that were ""consistent with"" certain aspects of the wear pattern of the Adidas shoes and ""it was not possible to exclude the appellant as a probable wearer of the Adidas shoes"".

(c) Eyewitnesses
Ian Cross and John Byrne were friends of the deceased who saw the initial altercation and heard the deceased say that the appellant had taken his wallet - referring to a man with a goatee beard. A very general description of that man was consistent with the appellant. There was evidence that, in 1995 and adjoining years, he sometimes had a goatee beard.

7During the altercation with the appellant, both Messrs Cross and Byrne saw the deceased pick up a wallet from the ground. Three men who were described as ""Maoris"" or ""Islanders"" then became involved and one of them with dreadlocks assaulted firstly the man with the goatee beard and then the deceased. Ian Cross saw the deceased running away (in the direction of the car-park where his body was later found). Mr Byrne also saw him running away and saw the man with the goatee beard following him.

(d) Medical evidence
The deceased died from a head injury resulting in a subdural haemorrhage. Bruising on the back of his head and the blood pattern at the location where he was found were consistent with the deceased having been kicked or hit in the back of the head when he was on the ground, although it was also consistent with other scenarios. 

(e) Opportunity
In 1995 a friend of the appellant lived at Horsley Drive, Fairfield, not far from the scene of the murder and recalled that the appellant had stayed at her home on a number of occasions in that year.

8The appellant did not testify (and had exercised his right to silence when arrested). The defence did not adduce any evidence.

9Defence counsel in final address submitted that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant was the man with the goatee beard and even if he were (and even if he had taken the deceased's shoes and wallet) there existed a reasonable doubt as to whether he had caused the death of the deceased. She submitted that it was a reasonable possibility that the cause of death was not something done by the appellant, but a blow or blows from the ""Maori"" or ""Islander"" with dreadlocks at the place where the first altercation occurred. 

Witnesses at Trial

10Although the evidence at trial was very extensive, the evidence relied upon in the appeal was that of the two witnesses, Ian Cross and John Byrne, Detective Flippence who gave evidence concerning blood spatter and contact staining situate at and adjacent to where the body of the deceased was found, Dr Ellis, the forensic pathologist who gave evidence as to his findings at autopsy, Mr Jones, who gave evidence of two incidents he observed as he was operating a garbage truck and Ms Black who was driving a police caged truck and who observed an incident in the vicinity of where the altercation occurred.

Ian Cross

11Mr Cross went to his father's place on the evening of Friday, 2 June 1995 when it was getting dark. His friends, John Byrne and the deceased, were already there. He started drinking beer and scotch. The others had started drinking before he arrived. He continued drinking with them for a couple of hours and then they went to the Smithfield RSL. When it closed at midnight, they went to the Fairfield RSL. They continued drinking at both those locations. They stayed at the Fairfield RSL until it closed at 3am. Messrs Cross and Byrne and the deceased then walked to a kebab shop and consumed some kebabs.

12Thereafter, the deceased decided to walk home ""because he couldn't get a cab"". Mr Cross saw the deceased walk across the road and when he was in front of a shop called ""Crazy Prices"", he heard him yell out ""The c-'s got me wallet"". Messrs Cross and Byrne ran across the road and Mr Cross shoved the man who was there.

13He described this man as having short, fair hair, a goatee, fair skin and being a little shorter than his six foot two inches. On the Crown case this was the appellant. When Mr Cross shoved the appellant, he fell on the ground. The appellant got up and they were arguing about getting the wallet back when he saw a wallet on the ground and saw the deceased pick it up.

14Three ""Maoris"" or ""Islanders"" came from their left, being the Hamilton Road end of the street. The appellant told the ""Islanders"" that Mr Cross and his friends were trying to take his wallet. Mr Cross said ""No it's not. He pinched my mate's wallet"". A ""Maori"" with long, thick dreadlocks punched the appellant in the face with his fist. 

15The evidence of Mr Cross in relation to the deceased was:

""Q. What happened then?
A. I think Russell got hit then. Not sure.

Q. Do you remember who it was that hit Russell?
A. The bloke with the dreadlocks.

Q. Do you remember how he hit Russell?
A. No I don't.

Q. Do you know where he hit Russell? By that I mean what part of Russell's body was hit?
A. I think his face.

...

Q. So after Russell was hit, what happened next?
A. Just arguing and that and then I noticed Russell was up on the corner of the next pub, The Crescent Pub.

Q. Did you see Russell doing anything up at the corner?
A. Trying to get away.

Q. From who?
A. The dreadlock bloke.

Q. And did he get away from the bloke with the dreadlocks?
A. Yes he did.

Q. Where did Russell go?
A. Around the corner.

Q. Did you see him again?
A. No I didn't.

Q. The man with the dreadlocks, what happened to him?
A. Came back to us.

Q. Where was the man with the goatee beard?
A. Don't know.

Q. Did you see him again that night?
A. No I didn't."" (T.58.23 - 59.19)

16Under cross-examination Mr Cross agreed that his memory of what had occurred that night was fresher when he spoke to the police on 24 September 1999 than when he was giving evidence at trial (1 June 2011) (T.68.42).

17Under cross-examination Mr Cross gave further evidence concerning the deceased:

""Q. It was then that the Maori fellow with the dreadlocks assaulted Russell.
A. Yes.

Q. He punched him a couple of times?
A. Yes.

Q. And you could see that Russell was hurt and bleeding?
A. Yes.

Q. Is the next thing that you saw of Russell was that he was further down The Crescent, near the corner where The Crescent intersects with Smart Street?
A. Yes.

Q. So you look up, you see Russell Lyons down near that corner, correct?
A. Yes.

Q. And the Islander with the dreadlocks is with Russell near the corner?
A. Yes.

Q. You and John Byrne are still up near the area of Crazy Prices store?
A. Yes.

Q. And you are still confronted by the other two Maori men, is that right?
A. That's right.

Q. There was an argument still going on between you and Mr Byrne and the two Maori men, correct?
A. Correct.

Q. When you looked down the corner of The Crescent and Smart Street and saw Russell Lyons with the Maori man with the dreadlocks, you could see that the Maori man with the dreadlocks was belting into Russell Lyons?
A. Yes.

Q. And it was quite a savage attack by the Maori man with the dreadlocks on Russell wasn't it?
A. Yes I think so.

Q. You could see that Russell was bleeding?
A. Yes. He was bleeding before he left us.

Q. Is this the situation Mr Cross, that you then lost sight of Russell as he went around the corner into Smart Street?
A. Yes.

Q. You didn't see him again?
A. No."" (T.70.10 - 71.7)

18In re-examination Mr Cross said:

""Q. You said that Russell was bleeding ""before he left us"". From where was he bleeding?
A. His mouth.

Q. How much blood was there coming from his mouth?
A. Just like you know, when you cut your lip and it just bleeds down.

Q. What about his clothes, did you see any blood on his clothes?
A. I don't think so.

Q. It was suggested to you in a question that it was a savage attack on Russell by the man with dreadlocks close to when you last saw Russell Lyons. Your answer was ""I think so"". Would you explain what you meant by that answer ""I think so""?
A. I don't understand, what do you mean by savage and just from getting hit?

Q. What I'm asking you is what you understand that to mean and why it is that you've given the answer ""I think so"" and what you mean by that?
A. (No verbal reply.)

Q. Perhaps if I ask you what is it that you saw, you agreed that you saw something like the man with dreadlocks belting into Russell. What is it you saw?
A. He gave him a couple more hits up in that corner.

Q. What part of his body?
A. Face I think.

Q. You said a couple more?
A. Yes.

Q. By a couple do you mean two?
A. Two.

Q. Did you see those couple of punches connect with Russell Lyons?
A. I think they did.

Q. What part of his body did they connect with?
A. I said the face."" (T.73.32 - 74.26)

John Byrne

19Mr Byrne gave evidence that at about 5pm on 2 June 1995 he and the deceased were drinking bourbon and coke, with the bourbon coming from a hip flask. Mr Cross arrived and they stayed at that location until 8 - 8.30pm when they were driven to the Smithfield RSL Club. They continued drinking at the Smithfield RSL until it closed at midnight. They took a taxi to the Fairfield RSL where they continued drinking and left at closing time, around 3am. Mr Byrne agreed that he was drunk but said that he was still able to walk. The three of them then consumed some kebabs.

20Mr Byrne went to a phone box and observed the deceased walk across the road from the kebab shop. He heard the deceased yell out ""Hey, he's got my wallet"". Mr Byrne hung up the phone and he and Mr Cross ran across the road. Mr Cross bumped into the appellant and knocked him to the ground. The deceased said ""He wanted a smoke but then he took my wallet"". Mr Byrne saw the deceased pick something off the ground and put it in his pocket.

21Three ""Islander"" men then came towards them from the Hamilton Road end of the street. One of the Islanders said ""What is going on here?"". Mr Cross said that the appellant ""Was trying to steal our mate's wallet"" and the Islander with the dreadlocks kicked the appellant who fell down next to the footpath. The man with the dreadlocks was of solid build. The appellant got up and said ""No, they tried to take his wallet"".

22Thereafter, his evidence was:

""Q. When that man said what you just told us he said then, about after he was kicked, what was the next thing that happened?
A. Then the man with the dreadlocks kicked my friend Russell.

Q. What part of Russell's body was kicked?
A. In the leg I think.

Q. What response was there from Russell when he was kicked in the leg?
A. He went down, he went to the ground a bit and got back up.

...

Q. When Russell got back up what did you see him do next?
A. He ran off.

Q. In which direction?
A. Towards the police station. Down to the right, down the side street there is a police station down that way. 

...

Q. Did you see Russell Lyons again?
A. No.

Q. The man with the goatee, did you see him?
A. I see him run around the corner.

Q. The same corner that Russell Lyons ran around?
A. Yes.

Q. What distance was there between the two of them?
A. Oh, I'm not sure probably 20, 30 metres.

Q. In between each other?
A. Yes.

Q. Did you see that man with the goatee again?
A. No.

Q. The three men you referred to as ""Islanders' where were they when Russell Lyons ran around that corner?
A. They were in the middle of the road.

Q. Those three Islander men where were they when the man with the goatee ran around the corner at the same time?
A. Yeah, middle of the road."" (T.89.41 - 90.44)

23Under cross-examination Mr Byrne agreed that he had worked a night shift the previous night that ended at 7am on 2 June 1995. He had waited until a bottle shop opened and had commenced drinking at about 10am. He had continued to consume alcohol and did not go to sleep that day. He agreed that his memory could be blurry because of the amount of alcohol which he had consumed.

24In relation to the deceased, Mr Byrne said:

""Q. You saw the Islander with the dreadlocks kick Russell Lyons?
A. Yes.

Q. How many times did he kick him?
A. I think he kicked him once.

Q. Could it have been more than once.
A. He tried to kick him the second time and he missed, yeah.

Q. You're not sure about it?
A. I'm not sure.

Q. Sorry.
A. Not sure.

Q. So he could have kicked him more than once?
A. I'm sure it was only once.

Q. Well you're not sure?
A. Yes.

Q. Or are you sure which is it Mr Byrne?
A. It was once.

Q. And was it to - where was it?
A. Leg.

Q. To Russell Lyons' body?
A. Leg.

Q. Wasn't it to the stomach?
A. No.

Q. Could it have been sorry go on?
A. I'm not sure.

Q. Could it have been to the head of Russell Lyons.
A. No I didn't see.

Q. Sorry?
A. I didn't see him.

Q. Could you ...
A. I seen his leg, leg may be in the stomach it wasn't the head.

Q. Could you be unsure about it, could it have been the head?
A. No.

Q. You recall being interviewed by the police on 24 September 1999 at Fairfield Police Station?
A. Yeah.

...

Q. All right. And they ask you some questions about the kicking by this Islander on Russell Lyons, didn't they?
A. Oh, I can't remember.

Q. Page 11. You were asked (question 87) this question:

""Q87. At the time of this fight or this incident that we're talking about with the Pacific islander kicked him...""

this is a referral to Russell Lyons.

""... did he receive any blows to the head?
A. I can't remember.

Q88. Well, you said he's only been kicked once.
A. Yeah, Well, I don't know if ...""

Then it's not transcribed.

""... or not. I know he tried to.

Q89 And you said - did he kick him? Whereabouts did that kick land though? Like, there's a fair difference between someone's head and their stomach?
A. Yeah. I think he copped one in the stomach.

Q90 Yeah.""

And then your answer.

""A. But I'm not sure about if he copped one in the head or not.""

Q. Do you recall giving that answer?
A. No.

Q. Do you dispute giving that answer?
A. No, I'm not disputing that. No.

Q. So it could be that he copped a kick, that is, Russell Lyons copped a kick, to the head. You just can't be sure?
A. Can't be sure, no.

Q. When I say copped a kick to the head, I mean by the fellow with the dreadlocks?
A. Yeah.

Q. You understand that's what I'm asking you?
A. Yeah. Yeah."" (T.103.3 - 105.50)

25In relation to the appellant, Mr Byrne said:

""Q. And what I want to suggest is that you can't, taking into account those circumstances and your intoxication, you can't be sure what happened to the man, the Australian man with the growth, the facial hair (indicated)?
A. Yeah.

Q. Do you agree with that?
A. Yeah.

Q. You don't know when he ran off?
A. Just seen him run around the corner. That was it.

Q. But you don't know when that was in the chronology of what went on, do you?
A. I can't be sure."" (T.106.36 - .49)

Alan Jones

26Mr Jones was an employee of the Fairfield Council, who was street cleaning at the time of the altercation. He was driving south on The Crescent towards Hamilton Road. The time was about 3.05am. His evidence was:

""Q. Could you tell the court please about this altercation. Who was involved, what was going on?
A. I just seen a bit of a scuffle and one fellow was on the ground because it must have happened as I come out of the bus terminal. As I got up there I seen something going on. I seen one fellow on the ground and another fellow tried to kick him but a third fellow pushing him back ...

Q. The first person you have described or told us about, would you describe that person the one who was on the ground?
A. He just had dark jeans on like - I don't know what he looked like, no.

...

Q. The second person could you describe him please?
A. The other two both looked Islander type.

Q. Anything about their hair that you remember?
A. One fellow had his hair pulled back in a ponytail, black hair, he was the one pushing the fellow away.

Q. Did you see any more of the first person, the one that was on the ground?
A. Not that I can recall, no.

Q. What about the other two, did you see any more of them?
A. I seen the fellow with the ponytail when I come out of The Crescent. He was heading towards the cab rank. 

...

Q. Is it as you go through the roundabout and head back up The Crescent?
A. I did.

Q. Is it on the way back up, when you got back up to the location you were at before, did you see anyone in the vicinity?
A. Yeah, there was a fellow on the ground, on the footpath, just near the arcade entrance.

Q. That fellow, can you describe him, please?
A. He was a young fellow with fair hair, light coloured jeans and jumper or shirt, whatever.

Q. What colour was the jumper or shirt?
A. It was a light colour too.

Q. What was that person doing?
A. He was getting up off the ground. He was quite groggy.

Q. Was there anyone here with him?
A. There was two other people there. I think they were both Islander types, and there was another few people just up on the other side of the phone boxes."" (T.30.7 - .47)

27Under cross-examination, Mr Jones said:

""Q. You then got into your truck and you headed along The Crescent towards Hamilton Road, correct?
A. That's right, yeah.

Q. The first incident that you have given evidence about is, that as you were driving along The Crescent you saw a male with dark jeans on the ground, correct?
A. That's correct.

Q. And would that have been in the vicinity of the arcade?
A. In the vicinity of where the buses come out, side of the lights.

...

Q. The first incident you saw was on the arcade side of The Crescent, correct?
A. That's right, yeah.

...

Q. And what you saw was, a male fall to the ground?
A. I saw him go to the ground. I don't know if he was punched, pushed or kicked, whatever.

Q. The first you saw was a male falling to the ground is that fair to say?
A. Yeah.

Q. And that person would you describe as an Australian looking with fair skin?
A. I couldn't tell you. He was on the ground as I said. By the time I got there, he was on the ground and there were two fellows over him, but one was pushing the other away."" (T.33.49 - 35.22)

""Q. And you were going around that roundabout when you saw a police station wagon?
A. That's correct.

Q. You told us you motioned to them to go ahead of you trying to get the police attention towards what was happening in that altercation, is that correct?
A. That's correct.

Q. That police station wagon, you said, went ahead of you?
A. Yeah.

Q. And it travelled slowly back The Crescent towards Smart Street?
A. That's right.

Q. And you were following?
A. Yeah.

Q. You turned into Smart Street?
A. That's right.

Q. You went up towards Spencer Street?
A. That's correct.

Q. And then you came back to The Crescent?
A. Yeah.

Q. When you came back to The Crescent, did you see another second incident?
A. No, no, I seen the second incident after - I didn't see the second incident. I just seen the fellow getting up from the ground, groggy, on the footpath.

Q. Was this a different person?
A. Yeah.

Q. And this second person that you saw get off the ground groggy, was he also on the footpath on the side of the arcade?
A. On the footpath, on the arcade side of the road, yeah.

...

Q. And when you saw him, was it the case that he was lying face down on the ground?
A. He was trying to get up. He was very groggy.

Q. Before you saw him trying to get up, did you see him lying face down on the ground?
A. I'm not sure.

Q. You recall giving some evidence in a committal proceeding - so a preliminary court case?

A. Yeah.

...

Q. That was last year?
A. Something like that.

...

Q. Mr Jones, you were asked some questions in relation to things that you saw back in June, on 3 June. I just want to see if you remember this. You were asked in relation to that second incident:

""Would you agree this second man that you saw on the ground had different clothing on?"" and you said ""Yeah"".

""Q. He had light coloured jeans on?"" And you said ""That's right"".

Q. When you saw him was he fully on the ground?
A. Yeah.

Q. Facing down?
A. Facing down, yeah.""

Do you remember giving those answers?
A. I must have if that's what's written down, yeah, but I could have seen him on the ground. I know he was getting up, attempting to get up. I don't know for sure now if he was fully flat on the ground when I first saw him or not.

...

Q. And the second man you saw on the ground had lighter coloured jeans than the first man?
A. Yeah."" (T.38.37 - 39.39)

28The photographs of the deceased taken where his body was found show that he was wearing a light coloured top and light coloured jeans.

Anita Black

29Ms Black was a police officer in 1995. On the evening of Friday, 2 June 1995 she was the driver of a marked police caged truck. At about 3.30am on the morning of Saturday, 3 June 1995 she was driving along The Crescent at Fairfield. Her evidence as to what she saw was:

""Q. Tell us what you saw please?
A. When I saw that the person had fallen and then I sort of looked, I took more notice and then I saw a male person, a big Pacific Islander person dressed in black, reach out with one hand and grab the person who fell by his top shirt.

Q. As you are you uttering those words ""by the top of his shirt"" you placed your right hand --
A. Yes.

Q - on around the neck or upper chest area?
A. Yes.

Q. In a clenched fashion?
A. Yes.

Q. Is that what you are saying you saw?
A. Yes.

Q. The person that had fallen over, that was being grabbed in that way, could you describe that person, please?
A. I just vaguely remember him being dressed in cream coloured clothing. I believe he had blondish wavy hair. That's all I can remember.

Q. In the moments before you saw this out the corner of your eye, was the police vehicle that you were driving travelling below, at, or above the prevailing speed limit?
A. I honestly can't recall, but I wouldn't have been driving, like, really fast. Probably at the prevailing speed limit because at that time of the night there was no traffic around.

...

Q. What was the next thing you saw after seeing that this man was grabbing the man in the cream coloured clothes in the chest area?
A. I thought he actually lifted him up.

Q. With one hand?
A. Yes, lifted him up to his feet.

...

Q. What I would like you to do is tell us what you saw?
A. Just that he had - the Pacific Islander man had the man in the cream coloured clothes, just holding him there. That was all I remember.

...

Q. Did you see that hand, that grabbed the man, do anything else?
A. No.

Q. What about the other hand of the man?
A. No.

Q. Did you see it do anything else?
A. No.

Q. Did you see where his left hand was or his other hand was?
A. I can only say by his side. I didn't see his other hand do anything else."" (T.204.30 - 206.32)

Detective Sergeant Terry Flippence

30Detective Flippence was an expert in blood spatter pattern interpretation. He was provided with a statement and photographs of the scene, the Adidas shoes, reports of forensic biologists from the Division of Analytical Laboratories (DAL), a photogrammetry plan and the autopsy report by Dr Peter Ellis, including photographs of the post mortem examination.

31Detective Flippence was taken to a statement which he made, where he said:

""A. the light coloured jumper the deceased was wearing had extensive contact blood stain to both arm sleeves, but primarily to the right sleeve. I noted no projected staining on the back or front of the jumper.""

32Detective Flippence could not determine whether the blood staining on the Adidas shoes was projected or contact. The location of the blood on the side of the sole and the side of the shoes indicated that the shoes could have been in the paved area at the time the blood event occurred and blood could have come onto the shoes at that time. Detective Flippence considered that it was unlikely that the shoes were walked into the area after the blood event occurred because one would get blood transferring onto the rubber sole of the shoe and when the person walked out of the scene, there would be partial shoe impressions and there were none.

33Relevant parts of the evidence of Detective Flippence are:

""Q. The phrase that you use ""blood event"", what is the blood event that has occurred that's created the blood presence and spatter as depicted in the photogrammetry plan?
A. The blood event, the spatter in between the deceased's body and the wall, specifically is, as a result of a blood event that has caused the sudden downward movement of the deceased's head with blood either on the deceased's face and/or on the concrete underneath hitting onto the concrete surface and causing the spattering of blood.

Q. After that happened, after that blood event happened, are you able to say whether there were any further blood events?
A. There is two types of spatter in that scene. One that I just described between the deceased and the wall, another one with circular blood, mainly around the deceased's arms and elbows, and there is also some wipe patterns. The deceased's left arm has wiped some of the blood on the concrete floor. In what order they are in is very hard to tell, although I would say that the spattering and the blood around where the deceased was lying, as opposed to the blood to the right of the deceased, there is an elliptical shape area of blood and another area of blood under that, I would say they would happen first otherwise there would be more blood in that area considering the blood where the deceased is laying.

Q. So are you able to say whether there was more than one blood event?
A. I can say one or more blood events. If the deceased's head was forced downwards or went downwards in a rapid motion, for the spatter to occur he has to have blood on his face or under his face at the time. So, if there is no blood under his face on the first instance then that would not create a blood spatter. That would create - the first downward force would create an injury which would create blood on the face and subsequent ones would create a spatter.

Q. I give you this scenario. The deceased was bleeding to the face and had simply fallen to the ground without any involvement of any second party. Is that consistent with the blood spatter pattern that you represented in this photogrammetry plan?
A. It may be.

Q. Can you explain why it may be?
A. Well, the deceased would have to have blood on his face and the deceased falling on the ground represents a blood event which is a sudden downward force.

Q. If there was an absence of blood on the front of the jumper of the deceased, but large amounts of blood on the arm does that affect your answer?
A. Yes.

Q. How?
A. I would say for somebody to be standing there and bleeding to a medium to large extent on his face, he would almost certainly have blood underneath the chin and collar and upper chest area of the jumper. The blood on the arms is contact staining and is as a result of the deceased, whilst bleeding, having his arms underneath his face as he does when he was found."" (T.291.5 - 292.6)

""Q. What can you say about the staining, if anything on the front of the jumper as we see it there?
A. The staining is minimal. There is an area up on the right shoulder between the collar and the top of the arm which is a contact stain. And on the upper left chest area there is, what I can easily say is a squarish type contact stain, and there is some minor staining underneath those areas but nothing major.

Q. Any of those stains caused by blood dripping down the face just as a result of gravity. That is, from the deceased having been in a standing position and bleeding onto the front of the jumper?
A. One or two may, but the rest are contact staining."" (T.292.19 - .29)

""Q. ... That wall that was in front of the deceased's head has that ""no parking"" sign on it, the spatter patter that was there, what was the blood event that caused that pattern?
A. On the wall, the blood event was as a result of the sharp downward force of the deceased's head on the concrete.

Q. Are you able to say what kind of force would have created that pattern?
A. It could have been a number of things. Could have been somebody stomping on the back of the deceased's head, could have been the deceased lying down trying to get up losing consciousness and coming back down on the concrete. Could have been the deceased falling. As long as he had the blood that was evident on his face and on the concrete underneath."" (T.292.44 - 293.5)

34Under cross-examination Detective Flippence gave the following evidence:

""Q. In relation to blood spatter, would you agree that that is a term that describes a blood stain that results from blood being dispersed through the air due to some sort of external force?
A. Yes.

Q. There are stains that are referred to as transfer stains?
A. Yes.

Q. And that is something different to spatter stains?
A. Yes.

Q. Transfer stains, would you agree, is a blood stain resulting from contact between a bloodied or a blood-bearing surface and another surface; correct?
A. Yes.

Q. So --
A. Transferring the blood from one surface to another.

Q. So there is a distinction to be made between those two types of staining; correct?
A. Yes, there is.

Q. Just going back to photograph 19, the blood spatter pattern that you saw in the photographs depicted on the ground immediately in front of the deceased and on the besser block wall, could that blood spatter have been as a result of a single impact?
A. Yes, but only if the deceased had blood on their face and/or underneath their head when there was a sudden downward force onto the concrete.

Q. So do I understand your evidence correctly, there are two ways in which that blood spatter pattern I've referred to - on the ground in front and on the besser block wall - one, possibly if he had a bloody face and there was a sudden downward movement where he hit head on the ground?
A. Yes.

Q. And that would cause the spattering immediately in front of him on the ground and on the wall?
A. Yes.

Q. Or ultimately, if there was no blood on his face, if there was a sudden downward motion where he hit his head on the concrete?
A. Yes.

Q. And then got up or tried to get up and hit his head again on the concrete?
A. Yes. Again, as long as there was the presence of blood in that area.

Q. You describe in your report, this is at paragraphs 4 and 5 if it assists you, that near the deceased's right elbow was an oval shaped area of contact staining which had been wiped in the direction of the deceased?
A. Yes.

Q. In paragraph 5, near the deceased's left elbow was several stains which appeared to have been wiped through in an upward direction as the elbow is positioned?
A. Yes.

...

Q. Do you describe that as a stain that looked to have been wiped in the direction of the deceased?
A. Yes.

Q. I think you saw what you describe as a feathering effect?
A. Yes.

Q. What does that signify?
A. That is a contact stain that's been wiped in the direction of the feathering so it feathers out to nothing basically.

Q. Then you observed something similar to the left of the deceased at about his left elbow, is that right?
A. That's correct.

Q. Are those two areas that you've described consistent with a movement by the deceased himself, a movement of his arms himself, if the sleeves of his jumper were blood stained?
A. The stain under the left elbow moving in an upward direction I would say is consistent with that. But the stain on the right, I can't say whether it is consistent with him moving or him being moved. That's what I'm saying.

Q. So it could be you can't exclude the reasonable possibility that the stain on the right was made as a result of movement by him?
A. That's correct, yes. 

Q. That's one of two explanations?
A. Yes.

Q. But it could be - it's reasonably possible that both the wiped, if I can call them wiped stains that you saw to the left and to the right of his elbows were caused by his own movement?
A. It could have been.

Q. That would have had to have been obviously after he was bleeding?
A. Yes.

Q. Because it would mean that his sleeves would have had to have been bloodied, the sleeves of the jumper would have been bloodied; correct?
A. Yes.

Q. Can I ask you this Detective Flippence: If the deceased had fallen to the concrete as a result of a sudden movement downward and caused an injury to his face that bled, if he was there for a time so that he was bleeding and the blood pooled onto the ground underneath him and he then tried to move himself so that he could get up and fell again onto the concrete ground, could that have caused the blood spatter that we see on the ground immediately in front of him and on the besser block wall?
A. Yes."" (T.301.1 - 303.18)

""Q. Indeed would you agree that at the time of preparing your report you were not provided with any information about evidence relating to earlier assaults upon the deceased on The Crescent?
A. No. I was provided with information from Detective Senior Constable Willy about an assault but to my knowledge there was no bloodshed in that assault.

Q. That's what you were told by Detective Willy was it?
A. Yes.

Q. So you weren't aware of evidence that the deceased had been assaulted on The Crescent and had been seen hurt and bleeding?
A. No.

Q. I'll just go back then. Noting that information, you can't exclude the reasonable possibility that the stains that were seen on the shoe, on the shoes, the Adidas shoes resulted as consequence of an earlier assault on The Crescent?
A. If there was bleeding at that earlier assault, no, I can't exclude that.

Q. I think, as you've already confirmed, you can't say one way or another whether the stains are transfer stains or spatter stains?
A. That's correct."" (T.304.11 - .33)

35In re-examination Detective Flippence said:

""Q. I was going to ask you a couple of questions about that last bit of your evidence, the two stains, the two blood stains on the right shoe. Taken one at a time, the stain that is shown in that close-up in exhibit T, the stain that is shown in photograph 71 in exhibit F, the back of the right shoe, you've said that you can't say whether that is a contact stain or a spatter stain.

Are you able to say whether or not the blood got on there by falling (indicated), as in the deceased being in an upright position and bleeding in such a way as for blood to have dropped on to the shoe whilst the shoe was being worn by someone and you were standing near the deceased?
A. No, I can't. Blood stain interpretation relies on pattern identification and shape identification, and that particular stain although it's a heavy stain if it was spattered doesn't give me enough information to say either way.

Q. The stain that is shown in photograph 72, in exhibit F; there is also a photograph of that in exhibit T. That stain that's there you say you can't say whether that's a contact stain or a spatter stain. Are you able to say whether that stain occurred in the same way that I've described; that is, the person wearing the shoe standing near the deceased when the deceased's blood has fallen just as a result of gravity to that spot on the shoe?
A. No, I can't say for sure.

Q. Is it for the same reason that you gave with the first stain?
A. Yes, it is."" (T.304.37 - 305.10)

Dr Peter Ellis

36Dr Ellis attended the scene at about 12.30pm on 3 June 1995. His observations are consistent with the photographs taken of the place where the deceased's body was found. Dr Ellis explained why it was not possible for him to accurately determine the time of death.

37Dr Ellis observed that the deceased's right arm, which was underneath his head, was heavily bloodstained. Underneath the jumper was a long-sleeved, blue shirt the right arm of which was also heavily bloodstained. The deceased was wearing light blue jeans and there were a number of small blood spots on both legs, but more on the right leg. He was wearing socks, the soles of which were clean and did not show any gravel marks or tearing to suggest that he had been running or walking in them.

38Dr Ellis prepared diagrams which set out the injuries to the deceased. The fresh injuries were numbered and described by him as follows:
19 and 20: Two small abrasions on the back of the right arm above the elbow;

17 and 18: Two small abrasions on the back of the left arm above the elbow and 17 on the tip of the elbow;

23 and 24: Two abrasions on the back of the left hand, each consistent with coming into contact with the ground around where the body was found;

25: Abrasion on the back of the right hand near the wrist;

27: Small abrasion just above the left ankle;

28: Small abrasion on the outer surface of the left ankle;

29: ""Tiny"" abrasion on the top of the left fourth toe;

1: Large abrasion behind, above and below the right eye, effectively on the front half of the right temple and the upper part of the right cheek (5 cm across and 4 cm high);

10: Large graze type abrasion on the right side of the forehead extending into the hair that had a very fine fragment of dirt in it, consistent with that part of the head hitting the ground (3 cm across and 4 cm high).

11: Abrasion and bruising above and behind the right eye (3 cm across and 3 cm high).

Broken nose on the right side of the bone, possibly associated with wound 2, a large abrasion covering the left side of the nose, much of the left cheek and below the left eye (11 cm across and 6 cm high).

3 and 4: Two abrasions between wound 2 and the left ear. Wound 3 was a curved oval abrasion on the left temple (11.7 cm long).

6 and 7: Two small abrasions above the left eye.

5: Abrasion on the lower part of the left ear.

14: Abrasion behind the left ear.

8: An abrasion just above the bridge of the nose, between his eyebrows (2 cm across and 1 cm high).

An abrasion just above 8.

The lips were swollen. Inside the lips were small abrasions or lacerations that matched the teeth underneath. The teeth were not damaged. The opinion of Dr Ellis was that there was some kind of impact that had forced the lips back onto the teeth and caused some damage inside the lip and bleeding within the lips.

There was blood and frothy fluid in the nostrils.

12: Bruising in the lower part of the head (6cm across and 3 cm high). Within that bruise was a slightly curved abrasion, 1 cm long.

13: Ill defined bruising above injury number 12 (6 cm across and 5 cm high). 

39Dr Ellis defined abrasion as follows:

""A. Well, it can be documented as an abrasion. They're small abrasions. What an abrasion is, most people are familiar with a graze or scratch. Essentially what an abrasion is, is a loss of the very surface of the skin, which is where the surface of the skin is removed. It usually happens when skin comes in contact with something rough; it may be the ground; it could be another person. But if you were just to punch soft skin of another individual, you're unlikely to get abrasion. If you punch something harder, then you could get an abrasion, actual loss of surface. You will actually have to have contact of the skin with some rougher surface to actually get an abrasion."" (T.517.17 - .25)

40Dr Ellis described the difficulties which he had in determining how many of the deceased's injuries were separate. 

""A. Given the fact that there are clearly a number of quite separate injuries, it is possible that each one may be caused by a separate amount of application of force. Although, it must be said that because the surface of the head is obviously curved that you could have one application of force that causes a lot of injuries at the same time purely because different parts of the head contact the ground, if it is the ground, at the same time.

Q. The two injuries that you have noted as 1 and 2?
A. Yes.

Q. Were they caused by separate applications of blunt force?
A. It is quite impossible to tell. One thing that you can tell about abrasions is that they can only occur with actual contact. So that the exact shape of the abrasion and the size of the abrasion reflects exactly the contact of the skin with whatever surface it was. They can't spread. Unlike bruises, there's just bleeding and bleeding can spread or even lacerations where skin can tear and can tear longer, abrasions are point of contact. So, they reflect the exact point of contact of skin on the front of the face with what may be the ground. That seems to be the most likely explanation given the context of this particular case. 

Now obviously the front of the face is not a flat surface. There's a nose that sticks out and the cheeks are curved. And to be able to get abrasions that occupy the left and left-hand side of the cheek, which actually curves around to the side, and the right-hand side of the cheek as well as the surface of the nose, I can't see the face hitting the ground flat not moving giving you those abrasions. I can't see how that is possible because the front is curved.

But if for some reason the head in contact, facedown, were to roll in some way so that those different parts of the skin contacted the ground and were rough, then you could get abrasions of that sort of a shape. So they could occur with one force, but it would involve movement of the head, a significant rolling in some way (witness indicated)."" (T.521.21 - 522.3)

41In relation to the blood found at the scene, the evidence was:

""Q. Are you able to tell us the blood that was seen around the, pooled around the deceased at the scene, which, if any, of those particular injuries that blood was coming from?
A. Now it assumes that blood was his. You know, it came from him, which was a reasonable assumption, but may not. I don't know that for sure. I couldn't tell. I mean, there were a number of injuries here that could have bled. Abrasions can bleed, although they tend not to bleed significantly. Certainly the nose, and there was blood in the nostril but that certainly could have bled. The lips, the inside of the lips were damaged and I can't exclude blood having come out from that. I would have been a bit surprised if the blood spots sort of came from the abrasions. It would depend on how long sort of he had been lying there."" (T.522.46 - 523.7)

42The evidence in relation to the back of the head was:

""Q. Sir could you tell us then about your examination of the rear of the head as set out in Silhouette Head 1.
A. Yes. The actually two areas of bruising are two injuries there, the label 12 and 13. 12, which is in the lower part of the back of the head, is an area of bruising. I measured it approximately 6 cm across and 3 cm high. Within that bruise you can see a slightly curved black mark. That is a small abrasion. So, you only see an area of bruising and within that bruise, there's a small abrasion.

Q. Is that almost like a boomerang shape?
A. Yeah, just slightly. People have used that word, yeah, but -

Q. - To describe that before?
A. That's it purely. But that's merely a word used to describe the curving, curvature. I should point out that of course that's on a fairly curved part of the skull anyway. And so, it wouldn't be uncommon to get a curved wound on it. It's 1 cm long. It wasn't very big.

Q. At 12 and 13?
A. Yeah.

Q. Are you able to say whether they were caused by the same impact or different impact?
A. No, it would be impossible to say that. To stress again that they're an area of the body which has hair on it normally and I observed them only after I had removed the hair. They're both bruises. 13 was above it, and again this is rather ill defined, 6 by 5 cms. I say ill defined because the edges aren't particularly clear. The thing about bruising, because it represents blood in the skin, if you could - at the edge it's not always a sharp line. Unlike an abrasion, it has a sharp line.

Q. The observations that you recorded at 12 and 13, was that after the hair had been removed?
A. Yes. You can't see anything of course with the hair. That's why the hair is removed to specifically look at the skin."" (T.523.18 - 524.2)

43Dr Ellis explained the methodology which he used where bruising had occurred. What he did was to make a cut into the skin and fold the skin back. This enabled him to identify bruising on the underside of the skin.

44Dr Ellis explained the difficulties associated with identifying the cause of bruising:

""Q. The injuries that you have depicted on this Silhouette, the left side, the right side and the rear view of the scalp, are you able to tell the court how many impacts or applications of force there's been to cause this haemorrhaging or bruising?
A. Well unfortunately, unlike with abrasions, with bruises you can have bruises that spread because they are merely bleeding which means all you get is damage to blood vessels. The blood gets out. Those blood vessels then travel through tissue. So you cannot predict just by looking at the shape of the bruise as to, first, how big the application of force was that created the bruise. It may have spread. And also, how many. In other words, you can have one bruise like for example, that one on the back of the head, the back of the skull there. You can have that bruise and it could have been caused by more than one impact. I am satisfied that it is likely to have been caused by at least one impact. It could have been caused by more than one. 

...

Q. - Could impact to that area of the head also have caused the bruising that was depicted in the left side and right side examinations of the scalp?
A. Well that's what I was actually about to come to.

Q. Sorry.
A. The issue of the temporaneous muscles is that you don't actually have to have application/force onto the muscle itself to give you bleeding into them. It's somewhat similar to the situation of black eyes. You can get black eyes, obviously bleeding to the eye, without trauma to the eye itself because blood seems to track. So, I think it would be unlikely for the impact to the back of the head to cause the bleeding to both the right and left temporaneous muscles and nowhere else, but the bleeding into those temporaneous muscles may have occurred by impact somewhere else; on the side of the head. I would suggest getting bleeding into both those sides suggests that there was at least impact on both those sides, and we effectively then got at least three impacts as in the back of the head, the right side of the head and the left side of the head."" (T.525.43 - 526.30)

45Apart from the broken nose, Dr Ellis found no other skull fractures. The only conclusion he was able to draw was that whatever force had been applied to the deceased's head, it had not been sufficient to fracture the bones in his skull.

46Dr Ellis found about 250 millilitres ccs of fresh and clotted blood in the left subdural space of the deceased skull. Dr Ellis explained the significance of that finding:

""A. I measured 250 millilitres ccs and also estimated the thickness of the clot. The reason for doing that is to give an idea. The reason why it's important is the very fact that it occupies a space is clinically important.

Q. Why?
A. Because the brain - the skull is a box. It's a box. You know, can't expand. It's because it's bony and the brain is inside that box and there is not a lot of space around the brain. So that if something fills space, the skull can't get bigger to accommodate that increase in volume. And so, effectively presses on the brain, squashes it and it can actually squash it enough to damage certain important areas of the brain.

And this is why developing blood clots in the head are dangerous because they grow, because they press onto the brain and compress the brain itself. That's why giving an idea of actual volume and thickness is important. For example, if it's just a thin layer, then while it's evidence that there has been some trauma, it may not be fatal. But something like 250 mls is quite a lot because we are talking again about the skull which isn't a very big structure."" (T.527.32 - .49)

47The deceased was found to have had a blood concentration of alcohol of .287. The relevance of this was:

""Q. Is that relevant to the issue of manner and cause of death?
A. I certainly would say it's relevant to the cause of death. The blood alcohol should, of course, be zero, and the normal driving limit is .05. So we're looking at a level that's between 5 and 6 times the normal driving limit. So it's very high. I mean, alcohol can kill you by itself because it is a toxin, and it's poisonous to the brain and the heart. If you have a high enough blood alcohol level, you could die from that alone. This level is probably not high enough to cause death by itself but certainly high enough that it is likely to have affected brain function.

You can't be specific and say what parts of the brain did it or didn't it affect, but it depressed brain function. Given the fact that there's certainly been evidence of some head trauma and bleeding around the brain, and presumably therefore, some functional affect on the brain itself, combining that with a pretty high blood alcohol, that's a potential complimentary effect. So I think it is, and I did put that in the formal causal of death as a potential contributing factor."" (T.532.26 - 41)

48Dr Ellis identified the cause of death as follows:

""A. I felt that the cause of death was head injury and I've used that as a fairly broad term. So that covers bleeding, covers the fact that it is likely that trauma that caused the subdural blood to collect may well have affected brain function. Unfortunately, just by looking at the brain even under the microscope, doesn't tell you whether it's working or not. So it's reasonable to expect that something that's clearly hit the head in one form or another, to the extent that you can get a significant bleed, is likely to have affected the function of the brain itself. I think that was the primary cause of death, but there's also high blood alcohol. I cannot exclude that as contributing so I put that as a contributing factor.

...

Q. Can I just finally see if I understand the gist of what you're saying, that death was considered to be predominately due to the effects of head injury, although the effect of alcohol may have been a contributing factor?
A. Correct, that's right."" (T.532.50 - 533.26)

49Under cross-examination Dr Ellis gave evidence as to the possible cause of the abrasions found on the deceased:

""Q. Is it possible or is it reasonably possible that some of the abrasions that you observed could have been as a result of the deceased being punched if the assailant was wearing a ring for instance, on their hand?
A. Yes. I think as I indicated possibly earlier on, talking about injuries, if a hand just applies a punch with an ordinary unadorned hand, if I could use that phrase, it would be unlikely to give abrasions like I've seen because they really are dependent on the skin coming in contact with something rough. But if the hand was particularly rough, a worker's hands for example, or there was some kind of surface like a ring that had rather than a sharp edge, had a rough edge, I certainly couldn't exclude abrasions resulting from that. There are some abrasions here that look nothing - I described them as graze type abrasions, that's a more even roughening. I think it very unlikely that a simple punch directly at that spot would cause those. I think they really are typical of that skin rubbing against a rough surface and the ground or gravel or something. A wall is much more likely.

Q. So in relation to the abrasions that you observed with a graze-type effect, those abrasions you say are more likely to have been caused by the deceased's head coming in contact with the ground?
A. Yes.

Q. And in relation to some of the other abrasions, you don't exclude the reasonable possibility that they could be as a result of punctures delivered if the assailant had either rough hands or some item of jewellery?
A. That's right. If I can remind the court there was an injury on the back of the head which is a bruise, but within that bruise, is what was originally described as a boomerang shape, slight curved abrasion. That's a fairly small abrasion. It may well be that's the kind of abrasion that could have come from a ring or some fairly small object.

...

Q. In relation to that injury that has the small abrasion, could that injury also be caused by the deceased falling on the ground, hitting the back of his head on the ground if there was something like a small rock on the ground?
A. Absolutely yes."" (T.533.44 - 534.33)

""Q. Then lastly in relation to the second skull that you've coloured on Silhouette Skull 2, do you see that is the bleeding to the underside of the scalp on the left hand side?
A. Yes.

Q. Could that relate to the external injuries that you noted as injuries 2 and 3?
A. Yes, but there are also other small abrasions 6, 4 and 5, even 14, they are sort of all scattered, a number of small abrasions on the left side of the head. I think I indicated earlier, I'm not saying they were all caused by separate impacts. Because the surface is curved, because the head may have contacted the ground which might have had rough bits on it, they may all have occurred as a result of one. I'm certainly happy to concede that the bruising in the temporalis muscle on the left side indicated that the skull's silhouette is consistent with those injuries."" (T.535.13 - .26)

50In relation to the cause of death:

""Q. The injury that you have indicated in your opinion as the predominant cause of death is the subdural haemorrhage. Correct?
A. Yes.

Q. In relation to that injury, could that injury be caused by a punch?
A. Yes it could. A subdural haemorrhage as I indicated, like other haemorrhages, occurs when blood vessels are broken and it's usually considered that the blood vessels that break, that cause subdurals are those small blood vessels effectively underneath the dura, tiny little veins. Some people believe there might be small vessels in the dura itself, it doesn't really matter. Anything that damages those vessels, causes them to tear, and they bleed and you get a collection of blood. That is some kind of physical force that may occur as a result of impact, so something striking the head. It may actually even occur without impact. 

One has to remember that the head consists of a box which is the skull and the brain which is inside that box and the brain can move to a certain extent inside the box. It's only fixed in certain areas. So it tends to wobble a bit, to put it fairly crudely. I think most people would be familiar with the term 'whiplash', for argument's sake, where a head suddenly flips forward and backwards suddenly. The brain, because it's not fixed inside that box, will also flip backwards and forwards, but it flips backwards and forwards not in exactly the same time as the skull. So it moves in relation to the skull inside, and it then puts pressure on those little blood vessels and they then may tear ...

But frequently, something striking the head causes it to move and again those blood vessels tear.

Q. If in this case, the subdural haemorrhage was as a result of the head being struck, or the head striking something, could the subdural haemorrhage have been caused as a result of somebody punching the deceased?
A. Yes.

Q. Could the subdural haemorrhage have been caused by the deceased falling to the ground and hitting his head on the concrete, the ground?
A. Yes.

Q. If it was the case that the subdural haemorrhage was caused as a result of somebody punching the deceased, could one punch, one single punch, cause that type of injury?
A. Yes.

Q. What sort of force would be required if it was one punch that caused that subdural haemorrhage?
A. A bit difficult to be specific because it's not necessarily the amount of force but the way it's delivered. Because if I go back to the analogy or the description of the head moving and the brain moving, what you actually have is a like a rotating motion of the head. The head is obviously fixed on the neck so it can move essentially forwards and backwards, a little less from side to side. It can't move up and down, so it rotates backwards and forwards. 

If the force applied causes the head to move backwards and forwards, that's the force that's most likely to give you a subdural. Clearly, if it was a blow, a punch causing that, then clearly the bigger the blow in that direction, the more likely you are to get a subdural haemorrhage. If you were to strike the head from the side, the motion is not quite the same and you're much less likely to get haemorrhage. It's not so much the amount of the force but it's the way the force is delivered.

Q. So if it was a punch that was delivered to the face of the deceased, could that be sufficient to cause a subdural haemorrhage?
A. Yes it could.

Q. Is it reasonably possible that the deceased could have suffered the subdural haemorrhage but not immediately become unconscious?
A. Yes it is. It depends on what's caused the subdural. If a big punch caused the subdural, that big punch may have delivered enough force to actually cause the brain to malfunction by itself, effectively independent of the actual haemorrhage. In which unconsciousness would occur pretty well straight away. If unconsciousness occurs because of the subdural alone, the subdural can take some time to develop and so we see this in boxers, you see this in other people, they may suffer trauma but then over a period of time which may be hours, they get increasing drowsiness and increasing headache and ultimately, they become unconscious and die.

The only thing you find at autopsy is subdural haemorrhage. Clearly it can take a long time. There is no way by looking at the haemorrhage, to say how long that took. I don't know how long this haemorrhage took to develop, it could have happened in a small space of minutes, could have happened in half an hour or so, maybe even longer."" (T.535.39 - 537.23

51Various scenarios were put to Dr Ellis:

""Q. Firstly put those locations in mind, I want to put this scenario to you Dr Ellis if there is evidence that the deceased was punched twice at the location where we see the red star?
A. Yes.

Q. And we also have evidence that the deceased was punched on a further two occasions at the corner of The Crescent and Smart Street?
A. I understand.

Q. If any of those or one of those punches caused the subdural haemorrhage, is it reasonably possible that the deceased could have made his way into the car-park area and collapsed there?
A. By ""made his way"" do you mean walk or run?

Q. Walked or ran?
A. Yes.

Q. Is that a reasonable possibility?
A. Yes.

Q. Is it reasonably possible that having made his way into the car-park area, that he could have fallen to the ground in that area causing the broken nose?
A. Yes.

Q. I think you indicated earlier in your evidence that the broken nose would have caused some bleeding?
A. Yes. There was some blood in the nostrils and it's certainly consistent with a broken nose.

Q. I think you saw the deceased in situ with the pooling of blood underneath him?
A. Yes.

Q. And the blood that you saw, could that be consistent with the broken nose?
A. You said the blood I saw. Do you mean the blood on the body, blood on the ground or on the wall?

Q. Blood on the ground?
A. Because there was some blood on the wall, I made a brief reference to it. It wasn't my job to do a detailed examination of it. But it was certainly on the ground. The other thing we must not forget, he was face down and obviously like that since death. That will cause a pooling of blood and if there's an injury, that can continue to ooze even if the heart has stopped. It's certainly consistent with a broken nose, yes.

Q. Is it reasonably possible that if the deceased fell on the ground in the car-park causing the broken nose and bleeding, that he then could have tried to lift himself to get up and fallen again in that area.
A. I couldn't exclude that possibility."" (T.538.5 - 539.3)

52In re-examination the following proposition was put to Dr Ellis:

""Q. The scenario that you were taken to, is there a reasonable possibility that the injuries that you identified on the deceased occurred in their totality, that is, the injuries to the front, the side and back of the head?
A. There are effectively four surfaces; front, both sides and the back, but they are complex surfaces. As I indicated earlier, the surface on the front for example, there's a nose sticking out and just falling face down is unlikely to - certainly it would fracture the nose, to give that fairly extensive abrasion we've observed on both sides of the cheek, without some kind of a rolling movement.

Also other injuries to the right side of the head and other injuries to the left and the bruising on the back of the head, I think one can argue you've got to have at least four impacts; the front, the two sides and the back. That's even suggesting that that's even taking into account the fact that if you look at the left side of the head there are actually seven or eight discrete abrasions. I have indicated earlier some of them could have occurred in the same time, it depends on the ground surface, but I would have thought you've got at least four kinds of contact. Given the problems with the front of the face, with the nose sticking out, I personally think it's more likely to have more than that."" (T.539.27 - .45)

53In relation to the cause of death, the following evidence was given:

""Q. You said yes, and could it [subdural haemorrhage] be caused by a single punch and you said yes. In the course of your answer you said there were other possibilities. You nominated, for example, the kind of whiplash or shaken baby syndrome, that type of injury. What about a kick to the head, could a kick to the head or kicks to the head cause a rupture to the blood vessels that led to the subdural haemorrhage?
A. A kick to the head is a kind of impact trauma and it does depend on what the head is doing. The reason why I say that is because if the head is mobile and the thing about subdurals is they tend to result from a rotational motion as I tried to describe earlier. If the head is mobile, as in not being fixed say, on the ground, and the kick in some way can cause the head to move quite a lot and certainly can cause a subdural. If the head is fixed and is firmly fixed to the ground in some way, then it depends on how the kick is delivered. 

If the kick comes from the side to the head and used to move then it could still cause the subdural, but if it comes from the top like a stomp type of kick, it's probably less likely to cause a subdural because the head is not going to move much. That will cause other injuries, other damage which I might add I didn't see here. I'm not saying that there wasn't kicking. That's another form of blunt force trauma. It's the issue of motion of the head, but if the kick caused it or a punch or a fall or whatever, causes the motion of the head, that's what tends to give you the subdural."" (T.540.3 - 24)

The appeal
Ground 1: The verdict was unreasonable

54The appellant conceded that it was open to the jury to find that he was the man with the goatee beard and that he had followed the deceased to the location where the body was found and had there stolen his wallet and shoes when he was lying on the ground. The issue raised by the appellant was that it was unreasonable for the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that he had caused the death of the deceased.

55The appellant submitted that the prosecution case was entirely circumstantial. No witness saw him strike or otherwise assault the deceased. He submitted that the Crown case depended upon the evidence relating to the deceased's injuries and the blood where the deceased was found, to establish beyond reasonable doubt that he assaulted the deceased at that location. He submitted that the evidence did not reach that standard and that the lacuna in the Crown case related to the issue of causation.

56The appellant submitted that the evidence supported a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence, namely that the cause of the deceased's death was a blow or blows from the person of Islander appearance with dreadlocks, at the place where the initial confrontation between him and the deceased occurred. 

57The evidence relied upon by the appellant was that of Mr Cross to the effect that he observed the deceased to be punched approximately four times by the Islander with the dreadlocks. While Mr Byrne did not give evidence of a punch, he gave evidence of a kick which caused the deceased to fall to the ground. That the deceased was on the ground at this location was supported by the evidence of Mr Jones and Ms Black. The appellant submitted that the evidence of Detective Flippence was equally consistent with the deceased falling to the ground as with an assault occurring at the location where he was found. The appellant submitted that the medical evidence was equally consistent with death having been caused by an earlier punch as with an assault occurring at that location.

58The Crown submitted that taken together, the evidence of Detective Flippence and Dr Ellis compelled the conclusion that the deceased was attacked at or about the place where his body was found, with at least four impacts being applied to his head to bring it into contact with the ground and thereby produce the nasal fracture, the distribution of abrasions to the skin (on the face, left and right sides, and back of the head) as well as the other bruising of the head that was found at autopsy. 

59The Crown submitted that the injury to the back of the head was consistent with the deceased (i) while lying face down on the ground being struck a blow with a kick or heavy punch or punches to the back of the head and (ii) while standing being punched in the face and falling backwards onto the ground in the vicinity of the two blood transfer stains to the right of the deceased and then rolling over onto his front where the further abrasions and bruises to the face and head were inflicted.

60The Crown submitted that an attack of this kind upon the deceased by the appellant, or by grasping his hair and repeatedly pounding the head onto the ground, would be expected to produce the constellation of head injuries present at autopsy, as well as the blood staining evident about the body, including the spatter on the ground and the wall adjacent to the head of the deceased.

61The Crown submitted that the evidence of Messrs Byrne, Cross, Jones and Ms Black of the various incidents in The Crescent, did not suggest that the deceased had sustained any injury that produced significant visible bleeding and that also caused such a rotational movement of the head that there resulted a subdural haematoma in a young, adult, male person.

62It submitted that the flight of the deceased from the corner of Smart Street and The Crescent and the distribution of head injuries over four facets of the head were contrary to any scenario that the deceased might have collapsed in the car-park for reasons not associated with an attack by the appellant and then repeatedly have attempted to get back up, only to also repeatedly fall/slump back to the ground.

63In oral submissions the Crown said:

""CROWN: Quite so, and pivotal to it [the evidence] is the evidence of Dr Ellis. It's the nature of circumstantial cases and alleged available rational hypotheses such as this, a lacuna, that evidence of that genre would be evidence your Honours have particular regard to notwithstanding the idiosyncrasies if I can use that term of evidence that's given by Messrs Byrne and Cross."" (AT10.28)

Consideration

64I have concluded that this ground of appeal has been made out. I have concluded that the verdict of the jury is unreasonable and cannot be supported on the evidence.

65The test to be applied in considering whether a verdict is unreasonable for the purpose of s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is well known. It was explained by the majority of the High Court in M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 in the following terms:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence
to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude
that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the
court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the
evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.""

And [at 494 - 495]:

In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial
by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must
always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.""

66That test has been affirmed in the High Court as the appropriate test to apply in a number of cases: MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [25], [45]. In SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 the majority (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) said:

""11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".

12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""

13 The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""

Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter.

14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""""

67The evidence of Mr Cross in chief was that the ""bloke with the dreadlocks"" punched the deceased in the face. Under cross-examination he agreed that this person had punched the deceased a couple of times causing the deceased to appear hurt and bleeding. Mr Cross agreed that before the deceased left the intersection of The Crescent and Smart Street, he saw the ""Maori man belting into"" the deceased in ""quite a savage attack"". In re-examination he said that this person gave the deceased two more punches in the face.

68It is true that the evidence of Mr Byrne is different. He did not give evidence as to observing any punches, but did give evidence which was confirmed in part by Mr Jones and Ms Black that the deceased received a kick which caused him to fall to the ground. There was no logical basis for why the jury would prefer the evidence of Mr Byrne to that of Mr Cross. On the contrary, it is apparent that Mr Byrne was drinking for considerably longer than Mr Cross, his answers to questions were more vague and he himself was punched a couple of times by one of the Islanders, which would account for why his observation of the deceased could have been less comprehensive than that of Mr Cross. In any event, the observations of Mr Byrne is consistent with some of the injuries suffered by the deceased.

69The medical evidence was that ""if the force applied caused the head to move backwards and forwards, that's the force that's most likely to give you a subdural"". I am prepared to infer, as the jury should have, that a punch to the face, or rather four punches to the face, was precisely the kind of force which could produce a subdural haemorrhage of the deceased's brain. This is particularly so if the punch was administered in a ""savage"" way.

70Moreover, the evidence of Mr Jones as to his observation of the person in the light coloured clothing ""trying to get up, he was very groggy"" is consistent with that person being in some difficulty. This was confirmed by the observations of Ms Black of the person in light coloured clothing being lifted from the ground by one of the ""Islanders"", with the ""Islander"" having his hand clenched on the top of the shirt.

71The high point of the Crown case is the evidence of Detective Flippence. His evidence was that if there was no blood on the deceased's face and the deceased fell to the ground, that would not create the sort of blood spatter which was found on the nearby wall. Detective Flippence said:

""- the first downward force would create an injury which would create blood on the face and subsequent ones would create a spatter.""

72Although Detective Flippence was prepared to accept that if the deceased was bleeding to the face and had simply fallen on the ground that would be consistent with the blood spatter pattern found, he doubted such a scenario because ""for somebody to be standing there and bleeding to a medium to large extent on his face, he would almost certainly have blood underneath the chin and collar and upper chest area of the jumper"". Since blood staining was minimal in that location, he thought that scenario was unlikely.

73When asked to explain other scenarios for how the blood spatter could have been present on the wall, he said ""could have been the deceased lying down trying to get up losing consciousness and coming back down on the concrete. Could have been the deceased falling. As long as he had the blood that was evident on his face and on the concrete underneath."" 

74There was evidence that the deceased had blood on his face. Mr Cross said that the deceased was bleeding ""before he left us"". In re-examination he explained that he was bleeding from the mouth. When asked to say how much blood was coming from his mouth, he said ""Just like you know, when you cut your lip and it just bleeds down"". Mr Cross did not see any blood on the deceased's clothes.

75I infer from the answers provided by Mr Cross that his observation of the deceased was when the deceased was near to Mr Byrne and himself and was first punched by one of the ""Islanders"". He clearly did not see the deceased after he was punched a second time at the corner of The Crescent and Smart Street. There could have been more damage done to his face at that time. When Dr Ellis was describing the deceased's injuries he said that there were small abrasions and lacerations inside the deceased's lips which matched his teeth from which he inferred there was some kind of impact which had forced the lips back onto the teeth and caused some damage inside the lip and bleeding within the lips. Dr Ellis could not exclude blood coming from the deceased's damaged lips (T.523.4).

76There was no evidence as to how much of that blood could have flowed onto the chin and collar and upper chest area of the deceased if shortly thereafter he had fallen at the location where his body was found. Detective Flippence did not qualify his answers under cross-examination in relation to that scenario:

""Q. So do I understand your evidence correctly, there are two ways in which that blood spatter pattern I've referred to - on the ground in front and on the besser block wall - one, possibly if he had a bloody face and there was a sudden downward movement where he hit head on the ground?
A. Yes.

Q. And that would cause the spattering immediately in front of him on the ground and on the wall?
A. Yes."" (T.301.31)

77There was also available the other scenario which Detective Flippence himself raised in chief and confirmed in cross-examination:

""Q. Or ultimately, if there was no blood on his face, if there was a sudden downward motion where he hit his head on the concrete?
A. Yes.

Q. And then got up or tried to get up and hit his head again on the concrete?
A. Yes. Again, as long as there was the presence of blood in that area."" (T.301.41)

78The medical evidence decisively favoured the existence of a reasonable scenario consistent with innocence. The combination of punches received and the large ingestion of alcohol could have made the deceased unsteady on his feet, which is consistent with the description of a ""groggy"" person given by Mr Jones. Such a person might easily fall on his face, thereby breaking his nose without any intervention from a third party. Having done so, it was equally possible that he might try to get up, and fall again so as to cause blood spatter on the wall.

79The opinion of Dr Ellis that at least four impacts had been applied to the deceased's head does not eliminate that scenario. Such impacts are consistent with the evidence of punching and with the evidence of Mr Byrne, Mr Jones and Ms Black that the deceased was on the ground at an earlier point in time. They are also consistent with the scenario of a heavy fall on his face, followed by a secondary blow to the face when he tried unsuccessfully to get to his feet following the first fall. The generalised abrasions and bruising are no more consistent with the Crown case than with the scenario suggested by the appellant.

80When there was evidence of four punches to the deceased face, any one of which would have been sufficient to cause a subdural haemorrhage and no evidence of any blow having been received by the deceased from an external agency at the place where his body was found, it is difficult to see how a tribunal of fact could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the fatal blow was received at that location. This is particularly so when the evidence of Dr Ellis was:

Q. Could the subdural haemorrhage have been caused by the deceased falling to the ground and hitting his head on the concrete, the ground?
A. Yes.

Q. If it was the case that the subdural haemorrhage was caused as a result of somebody punching the deceased, could one punch, one single punch, cause that type of injury?
A. Yes."" (T.536.27)

""Q. If any of those or one of those punches caused the subdural haemorrhage, is it reasonably possible that the deceased could have made his way into the car-park area and collapsed there?
A. By ""made his way"" do you mean walk or run?

Q. Walked or ran?
A. Yes.

Q. Is that a reasonable possibility?
A. Yes.

Q. Is it reasonably possible that having made his way into the car-park area, that he could have fallen to the ground in that area causing the broken nose?
A. Yes.

...


Q. Is it reasonably possible that if the deceased fell on the ground in the car-park causing the broken nose and bleeding, that he then could have tried to lift himself to get up and fallen again in that area.
A. I couldn't exclude that possibility."" (T.538.14)

81The fact that there was a pooling of blood around and beneath the deceased is neutral. In that regard, Dr Ellis said:

""A. But it [blood] was certainly on the ground. The other thing we must not forget he was face down and obviously like that since death. That will cause a pooling of blood and if there's an injury, that can continue to ooze even if the heart has stopped. It's certainly consistent with a broken nose, yes."" (T.538.44)

82On the basis of those facts, there was a reasonable scenario consistent with the appellant's innocence and I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. While having due regard to the advantage which the jury had in seeing and hearing witnesses, the nature of the evidence in this case was not of a kind as would make such an advantage decisive. In those circumstances, the jury should also have had a reasonable doubt as to the appellant's guilt. This ground of appeal has been made out.

Ground of Appeal 2: The trial judge erred in the directions given to the jury with respect to the witness Ian Cross.

83In view of the conclusion which I have reached in relation to the first ground of appeal, it is not necessary to analyse this ground in detail. The criticism by the appellant is that the trial judge erred in warning the jury that the evidence of both Mr Byrne and Mr Cross ""may be unreliable"" so that the jury ""would need to exercise caution in determining whether to accept their evidence and the weight to be given to it"". 

84The appellant submitted that the correct question for the jury was not whether they ""accepted"" the evidence of Mr Cross, but whether his evidence left them with a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant.

85In oral submissions the appellant said:

""[His Honour] should have gone on to say that in the context of this trial where the defence does rely on the evidence of Mr Cross, the question's not whether you accept his evidence and, indeed, the warning I gave you about treating his evidence with caution really doesn't apply in the same way. 

At the very least you should, while you take into account his intoxication, the ultimate question for you would be in this context whether or not his evidence causes you to have reasonable doubt or is it a reasonable possibility that there were punches to the deceased, at least one, possibly more, in the light of the evidence of Dr Ellis and Detective Sergeant Flippence, does that cause you to consider that there is a hypothesis consistent with innocence."" (AT7.11)

Consideration

86This point was not taken at trial and accordingly leave to appeal is required pursuant to rule 4. Leave to rely on an error to which no objection has been taken at trial should only be granted where the appellant can demonstrate that the error has led to a miscarriage of justice: (R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20 at [20]; Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]; R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385; 157 A Crim R 238 at [99]; Carney v R; Cambey v R [2011] NSWCCA 223 at [67] - [70].

87As is implicitly conceded by the appellant, the direction which his Honour gave was adequate in that he was providing a general warning in relation to evidence called in the Crown case. The complaint by the appellant is that his Honour should have gone further and pointed out to the jury that the defence was also relying upon the evidence of Mr Cross in its case and when considering his evidence in that context, it needed to be looked at differently.

88The appellant's submission puts the obligation of the trial judge at too high a level. This is particularly so in the context of this case. His Honour was very careful in his summing up to stress the obligation of the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and the commensurate consideration that the defence did not have to prove anything. This his Honour did at SU [14] - [15], [18] - [20], [44], [51, [55], [57], [63], [66], [74] - [75], [78], [79], [80], [82], [91], [127] - [131]. Apart from fully summarising the defence case, the flavour of his Honour's directions to the jury can be seen from one of these many occasions when he reminded the jury of the obligations of the Crown:

""91 As I have said, the accused's case, is that he did not kill the deceased and nor does he know who did. It is submitted on his behalf that all he has done, despite the fact that there is no onus upon him to do so, is to point to possible suspects. In the final analysis, he contends that there are a number of persons who may have killed the deceased. That being so, it is contended on the accused's behalf that the Crown has not excluded the reasonable possibility that one of those persons was responsibility for Russell Lyon's death. Of course it does not follow that even if the Crown has eliminated the reasonable possibility that no other identified person kill the deceased then the Crown will have, without more, provided its case beyond reasonable doubt.""

89This ground of appeal has not been made out. There could have been no doubt in the jury's mind as to the obligation on the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and to exclude the scenario put forward by the defence. Even if there were an error (which I do not accept) in his Honour's failure to give a specific direction concerning Mr Cross rather than a general warning concerning both him and Mr Byrne, the effect of such a failure on the jury's deliberations would have been minimal. This is so because of the comprehensive way in which his Honour stressed the obligations of the Crown by reference to the particular facts of this case.

90Accordingly, I would refuse leave to appeal pursuant to rule 4 with respect to this ground.

Conclusion

91The orders which I propose are as follows:

(1) I grant leave to appeal in respect of the first ground of appeal.

(2) The appeal with respect to the first ground of appeal is allowed. 

(3) The verdict of guilty, entered on 7 July 2011 against the appellant should be quashed and in lieu thereof, there should be entered a verdict of acquittal in favour of the appellant.

92SLATTERY J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

93BELLEW J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2761188,R v Aiman SALAMI [2013] NSWCCA 96,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  I agree with RS Hulme AJ.  
2PRICE J:  I also agree with RS Hulme AJ.  
3RS HULME AJ:  The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals pursuant to s 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a decision of Armitage DCJ to exclude evidence of a recorded telephone call made between the respondent and the complainant at about the time of the events the subject of charges brought against the respondent.  In summary, the first of those charges was that on 19 May 2011 the respondent entered the dwelling house of Jaziba El Mazri with intent to commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely to intimidate the said Jaziba El Mazri with the intention of causing her to fear physical or mental harm and in circumstances of aggravation in that he was armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife.
4The second count of the indictment alleges an offence in similar terms but excluding the element of aggravation.  Judge Armitage's ruling was made during the course of the Crown opening.  In the circumstances to appreciate the context in which his Honour's decision was made it is necessary to have regard to what Ms El Mazri said in her police statement.  So far as is relevant, her statement proceeds: - 
""12. I then found my other mobile phone and set it up to use it as a voice recorder so that I could record what Aiman said to me if he called me again. 
13. About 4:51pm, my phone rang again from a private number. I answered the phone and I could hear Aiman talking. I held up my other mobile phone to the phone that Aiman had called me on. I used this phone to record what Aiman was saying. I didn't say anything back to Aiman but he continued to yell and talk into the phone for a number of minutes. The phone cut out several times during the call but he called back and I answered and continued recording.
14. During this conversation, Aiman said that he wanted to ""ruin me"", that he wanted to ""humiliate me"" and he called me a ""slut"" and a ""whore."" He said lots of things to me and repeated himself a lot.
15. While I was still sitting on my bed recording this phone conversation, I saw Aiman walk into my bedroom. Aiman was still holding his phone to his ear and talking into it He put his phone away into his pocket. When I saw Aiman in my house and in my room I was shocked, frightened and scared. I hid my two mobile phones underneath a pillow on my bed so that he didn't know I had been recording him.
16. He started yelling and screaming.
17. Aiman put one of his hands into his pants pockets and pulled out a small object made of wood. He flicked his hand away from his body and a knife blade came out of the handle. The knife had a metal blade about 10 centimetres long. He held the knife at about head height with the knife pointing towards the roof. I was sitting in the middle of my bed and Aiman was about one metre away from me.
He said: ""I swear to god, if you don't cancel the AVO I will slaughter you with this knife. If you don't cancel the AVO today, I will slaughter you because I'm departing Australia to Lebanon tomorrow.""  ·
18. At this stage I was so frightened that I was unable to speak and say anything. Aiman started to yell at me and kept saying the same things that he had said to me on the phone. He called me a ""slut"" and a ""whore"" again and said that he was going to take my eyes out. He kept telling me to cancel that AVO against him or he would ""slaughter me."" After about three minutes, Aiman ran out of the house through the front door. I didn't see where he went after he left the house.
5The phone conversation was in Arabic.  The respondent concedes that it is his voice to be heard on a recording of the telephone call.  An expert interpreter certificate asserts that translated into English what the respondent said was as follows: - 
""The male voice said: ""I will fucking screw you. (inaudible) I don't give a dick about you. (inaudible) I will pluck your eyes out and put them between your legs, (inaudible) Answer or I will scandalise you. Don't you want to answer? One, two (inaudible). If I say five and you dont answer, I will (inaudible). One, two, three, four, five... (inaudible) Lay off my dick. (inaudibte) Whore. (Inaudible) Come to me, at least I know you a bit You know what I mean, (inaudible) Is that how you want to be insulted? Go and let your neighbour hear all that (inaudible) No woman fools even my dick, (inaudible) Isn't your fee $150? Isn't it $150 a session? Fuck those who gave birth to you.""""
6Before Judge Armitage counsel for the accused asserted that there was a dispute as to the correctness of this interpretation although he did not specify the suggested differences.  Judge Armitage excluded evidence of the call relying on s 137 of the Evidence Act which provides: - 
""In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.""  
7His Honour's reasoning for the decision at which he arrived seems to be as follows.  I said ""seems"" because his Honour did not expressly state that he accepted the propositions contained in the second of the paragraphs quoted below.  However neither did his Honour reject them and the passages quoted set out the totality of his Honour's reasoning for his decision.  
""The way to resolve the argument I think is to attend carefully to the fact that the telephone call was made, except for the last few seconds of it, at a time when the accused was outside the complainant's premises, again taking the Crown's case at its highest.  The point of Mr Murray's objection really is this, there is a danger that the jury will not properly attend to any interpretation difficulties arising from the competing renderings of the content of the phone call from Arabic into English and will not attend properly to the credibility of the complainant in the allegation she makes or will make in the trial in para 17 and 18 of her statement, if the telephone call is admitted, and that the jury will simply conclude as set out above that the accused is guilty of the offence because he intended to cause the complainant to fear physical or mental harm wholly and solely on the basis of the contents of the telephone call.""  
""The contents of the telephone call are incapable of proving conduct of the accused inside the premises, that is to say ""therein"" in terms of counts 1 and 2 in the indictment because apart from the last few seconds of the telephone call it occurred outside the premises.  The danger is that the jury will substitute that evidence for evidence of the complainant's intent constituted by para 17 and 18 of her statement which she will give in the trial from which the jury may infer what the accused's intent was inside the premises.""  
8With respect to his Honour the passage display a number of errors.  In the first place there was nothing except a bare theoretical possibility to justify the statement that there was a danger the jury would not properly attend to any interpretation difficulties, a fortiori is this so as his Honour was not even informed to the extent of any conflict between the interpreted versions.  Secondly, there was nothing to suggest that any interpretation difficulties would distract the jury from giving proper attention to the credibility of the complainant.  Thirdly, there was nothing to suggest that the jury would simply conclude that the respondent was guilty because of an intention reflected in the content of the phone call.  Fourthly, his Honour erred in concluding that the content of the phone call was incapable of proving the conduct of the respondent inside the premises.
9The existence or happening of any event or intention is inherently capable of being proved by circumstances contemporaneous with it and by circumstances occurring shortly before or shortly afterwards.  Of course, other things being equal, the greater the time difference between those circumstances and the time at which judgment is to be made, the weaker the evidence of those circumstances may be but to say as his Honour, in effect, did that statements of the respondent minutes and seconds and indeed contemporaneously with his entry into the premises are incapable of proving conduct of the respondent inside the premises, is simply wrong.  The presumption of continuance, (see Phipson on Evidence, 17th Ed., para 7/20; Cross on Evidence, Australian Ed., para 1125), is obviously relevant in this context.
10Furthermore, the crucial question was not what the respondent's conduct inside the premises was but rather what was his intention at the time of entering.  His statements made during the phone conversation were at least as relevant to that crucial question as what he said once he was inside.  Also of significance is the fact that the complainant seems to have been the only witness to the events which occurred while the respondent was in her house.  As such one may anticipate that evidence would be the subject of significant challenge.
11Insofar as the respondent's statements and the phone call accord with the complainant's evidence as to his actions in the premises, those statements provided strong corroboration of her evidence.  In these circumstances, particularly in the absence of any evidence as to the respects in which its interpretation is said to be wrong, it could not be said that the probative value of the recording was other than high.  There was no basis upon which its submission could have been said to create the danger of unfair prejudice to the respondent and his Honour erred in his decision to exclude it.
12Although no point was taken on the terms of s 5(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act which permits an appeal such as occurred in this case, only if the decision or ruling ""eliminates or substantially weakens"" the prosecution case.  It follows from what I have said that his Honour's ruling does so.  The appeal should be allowed.  The orders sought by the Crown were 1 An order vacating the decision or ruling made by his Honour Judge Armitage.2 An order that the evidence of the telephone calls between the accused and Jaziba El Mazri is admissible.3 An order that the evidence of the translation of those recorded calls into the English language by Joseph Abdo is admissible.4 Such further or other order as this Honourable Court thinks fit.
13In addition to allowing the appeal it is appropriate that orders 1 to 3 that I have just quoted be made.
14MACFARLAN JA:  The orders of the Court will be
1 Appeal allowed.
2 Vacate the decision or ruling made by his Honour Judge Armitage excluding evidence of recorded telephone calls between the accused and Jaziba El Mazri and the translation of those recorded calls by Joseph Abdo pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995.
3 Order that the evidence of the telephone calls between the accused and Jaziba El Mazri is admissible.
4 Order that the evidence of the translation of those recorded calls into the English language by Joseph Abdo is admissible.  **********

2761203,Cvetkovic v R [2013] NSWCCA 66,"Judgment
1Price J:  I agree with McCallum J.
2McCallum J:  Dragan Cvetkovic was found guilty by a jury of wounding with intent to murder, contrary to s 27 of the Crimes Act 1900.  The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 25 years.  The offence carries a standard non-parole period under s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 of 10 years.  The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 13 years and a balance of term of 4 years and 4 months.  An appeal against his conviction was dismissed by this Court: Cvetkovic v R [2010] NSWCCA 329.  Leave to appeal against that decision was refused by the High Court.  He now seeks leave under s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to bring a separate appeal against the sentence passed following his conviction.
3The application was not brought within the period prescribed under regulation 3B of the Criminal Appeal Rules.  The applicant was sentenced on 7 August 2009.  He did not give notice of his intention to apply for leave to appeal against the sentence passed.  Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal ought to have been filed within three months after the date of sentence: reg 3B(1)(b) of the Rules.  The present application was filed on 3 September 2012 and is accordingly almost three years out of time.  The Crown opposed an extension of time.
4The applicant has had no legal representation since before his trial.  He appeared for himself at the trial and in the conviction appeal to this Court and represented himself in the application for special leave to appeal to the High Court.  Following the jury's verdict, he declined to put any material as to sentence before the Court or to make any submissions on that issue, evidently having a single focus at that time on his proposed appeal against the conviction.  When asked by the trial judge whether he had any evidence to tender on sentence, he maintained that he was not guilty and would continue his endeavour to prove that.  The judge tried to explain that the matter had to be finalised by passing sentence before any appeal could be pursued but the applicant evidently did not absorb the importance of her Honour's remarks.  
5In support of his application to this Court for an extension of the time within which to seek leave to appeal, the applicant relies on his affidavit sworn on 22 August 2012.  In that affidavit he states that, throughout the trial, he was confident that the jury should acquit him.  He further states that he did not appeal against the severity of the sentence as he was expecting that the Court of Criminal Appeal would acquit him or at least order a new trial. 
6Since his arrest for the present offence, the applicant has been diagnosed as suffering from severe depression.  According to his affidavit, the contents of which are not disputed by the Crown, he has also suffered a number of psychotic episodes whilst in custody and has spent a period of time in the acute process management unit of the gaol, which caters for inmates at risk of self-harm.  
7Since being sentenced and in the various mental states described above, the applicant has evidently remained firmly fixated on the task of challenging his conviction.  His appeal to this Court against his conviction was dismissed on 21 December 2010.  His application for special leave to appeal to the High Court was deemed abandoned on 11 February 2011 but was subsequently reinstated.  The application was dismissed on 8 June 2011.  The applicant's affidavit states:
Since September 2011 the Lithgow authorities did not allow me to work on my criminal conviction appeal, claiming it was over after the [High Court's] decision.  I told them that I can appeal by way of petition of mercy to the Governor of New South Wales or Supreme Court.  I also told them that I can apply to the Human Rights High Commissioner in Geneva, Switzerland.  They did not allow me access to a computer or to any of my legal document on criminal case.  They required me to work.
8His submissions suggest that a petition for mercy was indeed made, and rejected.  The applicant's affidavit further states that, on 1 December 2011, he developed his fourth episode of psychosis, which lasted for six months.  
9In those circumstances, I am of the view that the time within which the application may be brought should be extended, notwithstanding the lengthy delay involved.  Although the applicant's failure to put any evidence or submissions on sentence before the trial judge was due to a choice on his part, it was a choice made without the benefit of legal advice and evidently under the burden of a measure of fixated thinking.  The applicant's failure to prosecute the present application within the time allowed under the rules must be viewed in the same context.  He is still without legal representation and, in what has often been a fragile mental state, has remained focussed upon having the conviction overturned at the expense of pursuing his right to seek leave to appeal against the sentence passed.  
10Having finally turned his attention to his sentence, the applicant's submissions in support of the application reveal careful legal argument, notwithstanding his lack of legal representation.  The submissions sought to be put before this Court include attention to matters properly raised on sentence which, through the applicant's own choice in the circumstances described, were not put before the learned sentencing judge.  He faces a lengthy term of imprisonment for a serious offence.  
11In those circumstances, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to grant the extension of time sought and for this Court to consider the application on its merits.
Circumstances of the offence
12As already noted, the applicant was sentenced after a trial.  The trial judge made findings of fact based on the evidence in the trial and consistent with the jury's verdict of guilty on the count of wounding Sladjana Cvetkovic with intent to murder her.  The following summary is drawn from her Honour's remarks on sentence.
13The victim was the applicant's former wife.  Their relationship had a history of domestic violence, including death threats, which had prompted her to leave the applicant several times before. On 31 October 2006, Ms Cvetkovic told the applicant that she was leaving him for good.  She rented an apartment and did not tell him the address or the phone number, which was a silent number.
14The trial judge found that the applicant could not accept that the marriage was over.  He believed that Ms Cvetkovic had formed a relationship with her supervisor at work.  He sent her a large number of emails begging her to return to the marriage and to abandon that relationship.  He managed to obtain her silent home number and her new address.  He called her at work one day to tell her that he was standing in the street where she lived.  Evidently in a separate conversation he told her that she had been followed.  The sentencing judge characterised the applicant's conduct during that time as stalking.
15On 6 June 2007 Ms Cvetkovic and the applicant met at his instigation to discuss the disposal of the matrimonial home.  As the applicant was unemployed and Ms Cvetkovic was employed, she had proposed that she would give the house to him and take a loan to pay the mortgage.  He had drafted an agreement to reflect that arrangement and wanted her to sign it.  They met at her workplace and then drove to a nearby shopping centre where they had lunch at a Macdonald's restaurant.
16The sentencing judge said:
Ms Cvetkovic described the lunch as tense.  She said the offender kept talking about their past, which she said she did not want to do.  He held her hand.  She was scared and pulled her hand away after a matter of seconds.
17The applicant and Ms Cvetkovic had planned to attend a bank that day to discuss obtaining the loan, but they could not get an appointment and Ms Cvetkovic had to return to work.  The applicant's driver's licence was suspended at that time and so Ms Cvetkovic got into the driver's seat of the car.  The applicant got into the passenger seat.  He placed his briefcase in the passenger footwell, which she thought was unusual.  The applicant is tall and Ms Cvetkovic said that he usually put his bag in the back seat to allow himself legroom in the front.  The applicant then produced a 30 cm gyprock saw with offset serrated teeth from the rear pocket of the briefcase.  As the name suggests, that is a tool for cutting gyprock, the offset teeth enabling it to cut in both directions, that is, on both the forward and backward strokes.
18The applicant's evidence at the trial was that he had bought the gyprock saw the previous day in order to prise open the window of the hotel in which he was staying so that he could jump out and kill himself or, if he could not open the window, to use the saw on himself.  The sentencing judge did not accept that evidence, finding beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant took the saw to the meeting with his former wife with the intention of harming her. 
19The applicant stabbed Ms Cvetkovic with the gyprock saw at least 30 times.  She had wounds in her neck, chest and back.  She lost a substantial amount of blood.  She was taken by ambulance to hospital where surgeons spent almost nine and a half hours repairing her wounds.  The wounds to her neck involved some nerve damage.  She had two complex shoulder lacerations penetrating through muscle and tissue to the bone joint, six wounds to her chest, 21 to her back, one under her left armpit which had penetrated between two ribs, one to the abdomen, a punctured lung, a cut to her left hand and multiple cuts to her right hand involving some tendon damage.  The large number of wounds to the back is explained by the fact that the applicant continued repeatedly to stab Ms Cvetkovic as she tried to release herself from the seatbelt to escape.  The judge recorded that she was finally able to escape when ""horrified"" bystanders distracted the applicant momentarily.  
20Ms Cvetkovic prepared a victim impact statement which the trial judge took into account on sentence.  The statement eloquently captures the sheer terror experienced by Ms Cvetkovic during the attack, the vivid pain she endured during its immediate aftermath and whilst recovering in hospital and the ongoing fear and psychological trauma from which she continues to suffer as a result.  At the time of the proceedings on sentence, some two years after the attack, Ms Cvetkovic described her condition in the following terms:
Despite my active attempts to recover, I am still not fully recovered. I have permanent numbness in my left arm and hand. During the night I have pain occasionally but every day after a couple of hours of work at my computer, my arm, elbow and hand hurt and become stiff and I have to do some exercise so I can continue. My left index finger is permanently bent, difficult to use despite all the physiotherapy I have had and the only solution is to undergo further surgery. I have decreased sensitivity in my both hands, especially on the tips of my fingers, my entire left arm, my left cheek, ear and left side of my neck. There is still a dull pain in my left breast. I am left with a permanent disfigurement of my skin, horrible scars that will be with me for the rest of my life as a reminder of the time when I was almost killed.
I need to learn to live with the consequences of my physical injuries and try to adapt to changes in my physical performance. However, what I will never be able to learn to live with is the mental anguish I still have. I regularly have nightmares about the attack and cannot stop thinking about the terror Dragan inflicted upon me, on 6th June 2007. I still take pain relief medication and have problems with my arm and hands. I still need to have psychological treatment to overcome the constant fear for my life and my daughter's and my future and constant feeling of tiredness. After two years of psychological treatment I still do not understand why I had to be stabbed, I still cannot come to terms with it and I still do not want to believe that it really happened. 21The judge assessed the offence as being in the high range of seriousness, at the higher end of the scale of offences of that kind.  Her Honour accepted that the applicant was depressed at the time of the offence and that this seemed ""linked to his acting in anger in stabbing her when she told him that their relationship was over"".  However, her Honour did not consider that the applicant's depression mitigated his conduct to any great degree.  The judge considered that the non-parole period imposed must be more than the standard non-parole period of 10 years.  As already noted, her Honour sentenced the applicant to a non-parole period of 13 years imprisonment with a balance of term of 4 years and 4 months, giving an aggregate sentence of 17 years and 4 months.
Alleged errors in findings of fact and assessment of objective seriousness 
22The applicant filed amended grounds of appeal at the hearing, which were not opposed by the Crown.  The first ground of appeal is:
The trial judge erred in finding that the objective seriousness of the offence was of high range.
23The consideration of that ground is necessarily informed by a consideration of the second ground of appeal, which alleges a series of errors of fact on the part of the trial judge, as follows:
The trial judge erred in fact by:
(a) placing insufficient weight on the fact that the Applicant also harmed himself seriously;(b) placing too much weight on premeditation, when the premeditation was just background thought, and the Applicant was extensively endeavouring to get on with his life;(c) placing insufficient weight on the evidence that 30 hours before the incident the Applicant was in 2 states of mind, one thinking of harming himself and his wife and second extensively reorganising his life to get on with it;(d) placing insufficient weight on the evidence that immediately before the incident the Applicant offered to drive, which is inconsistent with the harm which happened only minutes thereafter;(e) failing to recognise that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial: the incident with the victim lasted less than 2 minutes, the wounds on the victim, whilst being many in number, the most of them were superficial, scattered at the top left side of the back and the left shoulder. The victim did not sustain any permanent injury, was discharged from the hospital 8 days after the incident, and was back to work 11 days thereafter. The seriousness of the injury and emotional harm is of low to mid range.(f) placing to much weight on the victim's impact statement and ignoring the fact that the victim did not sustain any permanent injury, was discharged form the hospital 8 days after the incident, and was back to work 11 days thereafter;(g) placing insufficient weight on the fact that the Applicant did express his remorse for the incident in his interview with police shortly after the incident, using words ""/ am really sorry that I caused a public disaster.""(h) placing insufficient weight on the evidence that during the incident the Applicant was in a dazzling state of mind and in shock, barely aware and in control of what was happening;(i) placing insufficient weight on the psychiatric evidence on depression and that both psychiatrists agreed that it was the depression which caused loss of control and was the underlying cause of the incident.
24It is convenient to consider each of those contentions in turn, before turning to the judge's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.
25Ground 2(a) is that the trial judge erred by placing insufficient weight on the fact that the applicant also harmed himself seriously.
26The judge noted that, after Ms Cvetkovic was able to escape from the car, the applicant began to inflict stab wounds on himself.  Her Honour said (at ROS 11):
The offender had wounds to his neck, chest and abdomen, five to his abdomen and five to his chest, a punctured lung but no damage to his organs or blood vessels.  He required exploration of his neck and abdomen and surgery to repair a nerve in his neck.  He was discharged from hospital on 12 June.  It did not appear during the trial that he had suffered any physical after effects although he gave no precise evidence about that.  About three and a half hours after the offence the offender told police that he wanted to terminate ""our lives"", a reference in the context of the conversation to himself and his wife.
27After referring to the decision of this Court in Christodoulou v R  [2008] NSWCCA 102, the judge held that the applicant's harming himself while depressed should not reduce his sentence for the serious wounding of his former wife.  
28In Christodoulou, the applicant pleaded guilty to a series of charges arising from an extremely violent confrontation with his ex-wife, which also involved his children and other members of his family.  Following an assault on his ex-wife several nights earlier, the applicant made repeated threats to her including telling her that, since he was not being allowed to see his children, he would inject himself with acid within sight of his family.  He did just that.  He went to where the family was staying and, during the course of an attack of uncontrolled violence on every person who came near him, including police, he impaled his arm with a syringe, at some point evidently ingesting some of the acid.  There was no medical evidence before the sentencing judge but he was informed by counsel, without objection by the Crown, that the applicant had a permanent disability to his arm as a result, in the form of a ""crater"" where the acid was injected.  
29Dismissing an appeal against sentence, this Court held (by majority) that the principle of extra-curial punishment should not be extended to self-injury deliberately inflicted during the course of the commission of a crime: at [42] per Grove J; Johnson J agreeing at [45]; Campbell JA preferring to leave the point undecided at [2].
30The applicant did not submit that Christodoulou was wrongly decided.  The sentencing judge was bound to apply that decision.  Ground 2(a) is not made out.  
31Ground 2(b) is that the trial judge erred by placing too much weight on premeditation ""when the premeditation was just background thought, and the applicant was extensively endeavouring to get on with his life"".  Grounds 2(c) and 2(d) raise specific points directed to the same issue.  Ground 2(c) alleges that the trial judge placed ""insufficient weight on the evidence that 30 hours before the incident the Applicant was in 2 states of mind, one thinking of harming himself and his wife and second extensively reorganising his life to get on with it"".  Ground 2(d) alleges that her Honour placed ""insufficient weight on the evidence that immediately before the incident the Applicant offered to drive, which is inconsistent with the harm which happened only minutes thereafter"".
32The applicant did not contend that it was not open to the trial judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offence was premeditated.  The judge found that the applicant took the gyprock saw to the meeting with his former wife intending to harm her.  That finding is not challenged.  Indeed it is clear from the applicant's written submissions that he accepts it.  The applicant said (writing of himself in the third person, at [16]-[19] of the submissions):
The applicant is not guilty. His case is that had his wife not have grabbed the knife for the blade the incident would not have happened.  
The evidence suggests that the applicant premeditated the incident.  About 30 hours before the incident he bought a knife for that purpose. The knife was in his briefcase.  At the entry in the car, he took that briefcase with him at the front passenger seat.  He did this with thoughts of harming his wife and himself.
However, his case is that these thoughts were just background thoughts, without any desire this to happen (sic).  He wanted to tell his wife how much he was suffering.  He claims that he forced himself to get the knife out of the briefcase.  As soon as he took the knife out of the briefcase his wife grabbed it for the blade and started to scream.  Since then he was just acting.
He said that everything that happened thereafter was as avalanches.  His instant response was by instinct.  He struggled to get the knife out of her hand(s).  He lifted his legs to get the knife out of her hand(s) than (sic) he plunged into an uncontrollable behaviour which resulted in stabbing his wife first and then himself.  
33The submissions that follow recite a series of pieces of evidence as to the applicant's conduct in the days and hours leading up to the offence which the applicant submits are inconsistent with his having intended to harm his wife.  
34Those submissions must be considered in the context that the jury rejected the applicant's defence at trial that he had acted in an automatic state and found him guilty of the offence of wounding with intent to murder.  The trial judge was obliged to sentence the applicant on the basis of findings of fact consistent with that verdict.  It would not have been open to her Honour, had the submissions set out above been made in the proceedings below, to sentence the applicant on the basis that he did not intend to harm his wife.
35In those circumstances, the weight to be placed on the element of premeditation in the exercise of the sentencing discretion was a matter for the trial judge.  The circumstances in which this Court will interfere with such assessments are narrowly confined:  R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11] per Spigelman CJ; Grove and Hidden JJ agreeing at [22] and [23] respectively.  No patent or specific error is identified in the present case.  It will be necessary to return to the issue whether error of the kind required to be established can be inferred from the alleged excessiveness of the sentence.
36Ground 2(e) is, in summary, that the trial judge overstated the extent of the injury and emotional harm suffered by Ms Cvetkovic as a result of the offence.  That ground is related to ground 2(f), which is that the trial judge erred in placing ""too much weight on the victim's impact statement and ignoring the fact that the victim did not sustain any permanent injury"".
37The applicant asserts that the seriousness of the harm caused is ""of low to mid range"" having regard to the fact that the attack lasted less than two minutes; that most of the wounds were superficial and did not result in permanent injury; and the fact that Ms Cvetkovic was discharged from hospital eight days after the incident, returning to work 11 days thereafter.  
38In my view, that submission must be rejected.  As revealed by the facts recited above, the submission wholly understates the seriousness of the horrific attack to which the applicant subjected his former wife.  That the applicant was able to inflict over 30 stab wounds in under two minutes is scarcely the mark of lesser seriousness.  It is difficult to imagine any person surviving such an attack at the hands of a former spouse without suffering from lasting emotional trauma.  The contents of the victim impact statement were inherently plausible in that respect.  The weight to be placed on the statement was a matter for the trial judge, who had had the benefit of seeing the victim give evidence during the trial.  
39Ground 2(g) is that the trial judge erred in placing insufficient weight on the fact that the applicant did express remorse for the incident in his interview with police shortly after the incident when he said, ""I am really sorry that I caused a public disaster"".  The applicant endeavoured to supplement his evidence as to remorse in his affidavit relied upon in the appeal, where he said at [25]:
I refer to my words that I told to the police few hours after the incident.  I have the same feelings and apologies today.  I am devastated and terribly sorry that I caused my wife to be scared, for injuries that I [caused] to her and for public disturbance.
40The Crown opposed the admission of that material except in the event that this Court came to re-sentence the applicant in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  Paragraph 25 of the applicant's affidavit was admitted on that limited basis.
41In her remarks on sentence, the trial judge did not refer to the statement made by the applicant that he was sorry for causing ""a public disaster"".  Her Honour said (at ROS14):
The offender has not accepted responsibility for the offence and has not expressed any remorse or contrition.  He showed no sympathy or emotion during the trial when his former wife became distressed while giving evidence about the stabbing or prior incidents of violence.  He challenged the extent of her injuries.  The only emotion he displayed was for himself because he and the victim had separated.  There is no evidence on which I could make any positive forecast of his prospects of rehabilitation.  Nor could I be satisfied that the offender will not re-offend in a similar way.
42On the strength of the material before this Court, those findings were plainly open to her Honour.  I do not consider that the applicant's apology to police for causing a public disaster articulated any remorse for the offence itself or mandated any conclusion on that issue different from that reached by the trial judge.  Her Honour's remarks clearly draw on her assessment of evidence given during the course of the trial.  It is not the role of this Court to second-guess such judgments on the strength of single items of evidence considered in isolation from the atmosphere of the trial.  I would reject ground 2(g).
43Ground 2(h) is that the trial judge erred in placing insufficient weight on the evidence that during the incident the applicant was in ""a dazzling (sic) state of mind and in shock, barely aware and in control of what was happening"".  This ground substantially replicates the unsuccessful automatism defence relied upon by the applicant at his trial.  Consistently with the jury's verdict, the applicant stood to be sentenced on the basis that his attack on his former wife was deliberate and carried out with the intention of murdering her.  Ground 2(h) is not made out.
44Ground 2(i) is that the trial judge erred in placing ""insufficient weight on the psychiatric evidence on depression and that both psychiatrists agreed that it was the depression which caused loss of control and was the underlying cause of the incident"".
45The applicant appeared to accept at the hearing of the present appeal that, to the extent that the ground as articulated trespasses on the jury's rejection of the automatism defence and the verdict of guilty, it could not be maintained.  He endeavoured to confine his argument to the proposition that, accepting that he is guilty of the offence, the evidence as to his depression informs the measure of his moral culpability and so is relevant on the question of sentence.
46As already noted, in contending that the weight placed by the trial judge on any individual consideration was insufficient, the applicant must establish error of such a kind as to indicate that her Honour's exercise of her discretion miscarried.  
47In her remarks on sentence, the trial judge recorded the evidence given by Dr Westmore on behalf of the applicant that the applicant's depression deprived him of the capacity to know that hurting his wife was morally wrong.  The report itself was not in evidence in the present appeal but the relevant conclusions are set out in the judgment of this Court on the conviction appeal, as follows (at [96]-[97]):
96 Dr Westmore's account of the history he was given in September 2007 included:
""At the time of the incident he told me he was in the car with his wife, he reached into his bag to get the document.  The saw was in the bag.  He said he then went to show his wife the saw and to tell her that he was going to kill herself [sic].  He said his wife grabbed the blade with her hand, he fought to get it out of her hand and she started to scream.  He said 'I started to stab her'.  I asked him was he angry with her at the time and he said 'No, not at all.'""  (tp 1830)
97 After a review of available medical records relating to the Appellant, Dr Westmore's conclusion, in October 2007, was that the Appellant had a defence of mental illness, because he:
""... suffered a depressive illness, probably a major depression, prior to the incident.  He may have had paranoid or persecutory ideas towards previous employers but it is uncertain whether these arose from a paranoid personality structure or from his depression.  Nevertheless, a history of depression pre-dating the incident with his wife by several weeks or months is consistently given and immediately after the incident he was diagnosed with depression, and later with melancholic depression with psychotic symptoms.
Based on the history provided by Mr Cvetkovic and with the additional material I am of the view that Mr Cvetkovic, on the balance of probabilities, suffered from a major depressive illness at the time the incident occurred.  This is a mental illness which would have, on the balance of probability, totally deprived him of the capacity to know that he ought not to do the act.  He would have been deprived of the capacity to be able to rationally consider his behaviour towards the victim, probably at the time of the incident both in a moral and legal sense.  I believe that the defence of mental illness should be raised on behalf of Mr Cvetkovic on the basis that he was suffering from a major depressive illness at the time he stabbed his wife.""  (tp 1849)
That report made no reference to automatism.  

48However, her Honour also recorded the evidence given by the applicant himself that he knew harming anyone was wrong and that his actions could not be attributed to his depression.
49Separately, the trial judge recorded the remarks of Dr Nielssen (called by the Crown) that the applicant's depression may have affected his ability to control an impulse.  The relevant passage is set out in the judgment on the conviction appeal at [108] as follows:
One of Dr Nielssen's conclusions was:
""... it didn't seem that the symptoms of Mr Cvetkovic's illness affected his awareness of the moral wrongfulness of stabbing his wife.  The main area where it may have affected him is in his capacity to control an impulse.""  (tp 1531)
50The judge also recorded Dr Nielssen's opinion that there was a connection between the offender's depression and his wish to attempt suicide but not a connection between the way his illness affected him and what he did to his former wife during the attack.  
51The judge expressly accepted that the applicant was depressed at the time he stabbed his former wife.  As already noted, her Honour found that his depression ""seems linked to his acting in anger in stabbing her when she told him that their relationship was over"".  Her Honour did not consider that the depression mitigated the applicant's conduct to any great degree.
52I do not think any specific or patent error is established in the judge's assessment of that issue.  It will be necessary to return to the issue whether error of the kind required to be established can be inferred from the alleged excessiveness of the sentence.
53In light of the conclusions I have reached as to the specific points raised in ground 2 and the objective circumstances of the offence, I would reject the contention in ground 1 that the trial judge erred in finding that the objective seriousness of the offence was in the high range.  In my view, that assessment was well open to her Honour.
54Ground 3 alleges that the trial judge erred in not allowing a discount to the sentence for a series of alleged mitigating factors.  The matters relied upon by the applicant invoke the language of s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which lists a series of mitigating factors the Court must take into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, to the extent that any such factor is relevant and known to the Court.  Having regard to the mandatory terms of that section, the Crown very properly acknowledged that, although the applicant chose not to put any submissions on those matters during the proceedings on sentence, if any of the matters identified was in evidence before the sentencing judge and otherwise properly falls within the section, its impact should be considered by this Court, if not adverted to by her Honour.  It is necessary to consider each of the factors identified in turn.
55Ground 3(a) alleges that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial: cf s 21A(3)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  For the reasons already stated in respect of grounds 2(e) and 2(f) above, I do not accept that was the case.
56Ground 3(b) alleges that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity: cf s 21A(3)(b) of the Act.  I would also reject that as a mitigating factor.  For the reasons explained above, the trial judge was correct to sentence the applicant on the basis that the offence was premeditated.
57Ground 3(c) alleges that the applicant was acting under duress: cf s 21A(3)(d) of the Act.  There is nothing before the Court to suggest that he was.  To the extent that he was acting under the pressures of facing the end of the relationship with his ex-wife and the pressure of litigation in which he and his ex-wife had been involved, the impact of those matters was considered by the two psychiatrists, whose conclusions were taken into account by the trial judge as set out above.
58Ground 3(d) relies upon the fact that the applicant does not have any record of previous convictions: cf s 21A(3)(e) of the Act.  Her Honour had regard to that factor (at ROS13).  
59Ground 3(e) alleges that the applicant was a person of good character: cf s 21A(3)(f) of the Act.  The applicant was anxious to place some emphasis on that consideration.  He said:
""As to the Applicant's wife, the Applicant was with her for 27 years. She was his first, last and the only love and sexual partner. As to the Applicant's daughter, she gave evidence to the District Court: that since 1991, whilst living in Sweden and Australia, the father was teaching her Swedish and English languages, mathematics, computers, software; how to organise and keep her things tidy; helping her in assignments; taking her for tennis and swimming lessons; together they were jogging, cycling, playing tennis, walking around or going shopping...""
60The trial judge did not expressly refer to any such consideration, for the obvious reason that it was not urged upon her Honour at the proceedings on sentence.  However, the evidence of the daughter was before the trial judge.  It was a matter for her Honour what weight to give to that evidence in the context of all of the evidence at trial.  The matters concerning the applicant's former wife confuse mitigation with pathos.  Neither an enduring relationship nor the love the applicant had, and may still have, for the victim can sensibly be regarded as being of any mitigating effect when viewed in the context of the ferocity with which he attacked her on the day of the offence.       
61Ground 3(f) alleges that the applicant is unlikely to re-offend: cf s 21A(3)(g) of the Act.  The trial judge considered whether that was so and expressly rejected the proposition.  Her Honour said (at ROS14) that she could not be satisfied that the offender will not re-offend in a similar way.  On the strength of the material before this Court, in my view it was plainly open to her Honour to reach that conclusion.
62Ground 3(g) is that the applicant has good prospects of rehabilitation: cf s 21A(3)(h) of the Act.  The trial judge also rejected that proposition.  In my view, it was open to her Honour to do so.  The trial judge had the benefit, where we have not, of seeing the applicant cross-examine the victim and give evidence himself.  The judge's findings on the issues of remorse and rehabilitation evidently drew on her Honour's observations made during the trial, which should not be disregarded by this Court.   
63Ground 3(h) relies on the remorse allegedly shown by the applicant.  For the reasons explained above in respect of ground 2(g), I would reject that as a mitigating factor. 
64Ground 3(i) alleges that the applicant was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of his major depressive illness.  As explained above in respect of ground 2(i) it is clear that her Honour had regard to the relevant evidence on that issue.  Whether it may be inferred that her Honour had inadequate regard to those matters is considered below in the context of ground 5. 
65Ground 3(j) is the degree of pre-trial disclosure by the applicant and assistance to law enforcement authorities.  The applicant relied upon the fact that he made confessions to police as to what had happened.  In particular, he relied on the following statements he made to police:
""It was nothing to live.  My wife was drop the house so I wanted to cut pain and suffering that we exposed for years and terminate our lives.""
and:
""I am really sorry that I caused a public disaster.""
and:
""I do realise that this is probably from someone else perspective wrong but I felt that is only option for my life.  I wish to ask these people to terminate my life.  That's all I wish to say.""
66I do not think the degree of assistance provided by those admissions mandated any reduction in the sentence imposed.  They were made in the context of an offence committed in broad daylight before five eyewitnesses.  The applicant was stopped by witnesses from driving out of the car park and arrested by police at the scene.  In that context, his acknowledgment to police of his involvement was of scant assistance.  
67Although s 21A was not expressly addressed at the proceedings on sentence (for the reason already explained that the applicant chose to make no submissions), in my view each of the mandatory considerations under that section either was not established or was taken into account to an appropriate extent by the trial judge.  I would reject ground 3.
68Ground 4 is:
The trial judge erred in including, or not excluding, general deterrence as it has little, if any, weight, as the Applicant was suffering from the major depressive illness at the relevant time and as such was not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.
69It is well established that the existence of mental illness is a factor that may be relied upon as indicating that a particular offender is not an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence.  It is equally well recognised, however, that the existence of such illness does not mandate a reduction in the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate for an offence.  Mental illness attending unlawful violence gives rise to myriad, complex legal and social questions that cannot surrender a single, correct sentence.   
70As set out above, the judge considered the psychiatric evidence as to the major depressive illness from which the applicant suffered.  Her Honour also considered the competing consideration that offences of domestic violence require attention to general and personal deterrence and denunciation.  In that context, her Honour referred to the judgment of this Court in R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; (2006) 164 A Crim R 179.  The judgment of Johnson J in that case, with which the other two members of the Court agreed, provides a lucid analysis of the role of the sentencing judge in such matters.   His Honour said (at [77]):
An adequate account of domestic violence should recognise that it typically involves the exercise of power and control over the victim, is commonly recurrent, may escalate over time, may affect a number of people beyond the primary target (including children, other family members and supporters of the victim) and that it contributes to the subordination of women; domestic violence typically involves the violation of trust by someone with whom the victim shares, or has shared, an intimate relationship; the offender may no longer need to resort to violence in order to instil fear and control.
71A careful consideration of those social observations and of a series of previous decisions led the Court to reaffirm that, in sentencing a domestic violence offender, specific and general deterrence are important factors.  The trial judge had regard to those statements in the present case.  I do not consider any error is revealed in her Honour's approach.  
72It remains to consider ground 5, which is: The sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly excessive and unduly harsh.  The trial judge erred in ignoring or not considering length of sentence given in other similar cases ranging from full term 7 to 10.8 years, non-parole 5 to 8 years.  The applicant relies on 6 such cases. 

73In considering that ground, it is important to bear in mind the proper use to be made of so-called comparable cases.  The correct approach to such material was identified by Simpson J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 (in remarks approved by the High Court in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [54]) as follows:  
303 A history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. Such a history does not establish that that range is the correct range, nor that either the upper or the lower limit is the correct upper and lower limit. Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts.
304 But it would be a mistake to regard an established range as fixing the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence. To take that attitude would be, de facto, to substitute judicial selection of sentences in individual cases for the boundaries of sentencing for a particular offence laid down by Parliament. In this case, that range is from 0 to 25 years. Of course, it is well established that the maximum sentence is reserved for the most serious cases. It is equally well established that it would be an extraordinary proposition that a person convicted of an offence of importing prohibited drugs would escape any custodial penalty. The point I am making is that the ranges of sentences actually imposed, while illuminating, are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence. But it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that ""unifying principles"" may be discerned: Wong and Leung, at [59].
305 In the end, the sentencing discretion is individual: it must be exercised by the individual judge, in respect of the individual offender...
74The six cases identified by the applicant in support of this ground must be considered with those principles in mind.  Each was a case of wounding with intent to murder, carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.  It may be noted, however, that five of the six were determined prior to the introduction of standard non-parole periods, which came into force on 22 November 2002: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002, schedule 1[4].  The standard non-parole period of 10 years for the offence of wounding with intent to murder now stands as a second legislative guidepost (in addition to the maximum penalty of 25 years) to which the court must have regard among the full range of factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence: Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27].
75The earliest case relied upon by the applicant was R v Roberts (NSWCCA 8 March 1994, unreported).  The offender in that case tried to murder his wife while she was asleep by stabbing her repeatedly.  She sustained 4 stab wounds including one which penetrated the lung, causing it to collapse.  He was sentenced to a minimum term of 5 years with an additional term of 4 years.  In dismissing an appeal against the alleged harshness of the sentence, this Court described it as ""rather lenient"": per Gleeson CJ; Smart and Studdert JJ agreeing.  
76In R v Cool (NSWCCA, 2 June 1994, unreported), the offender stabbed a stranger who was asleep on a train.  The knife penetrated the victim's neck, narrowly missing his jugular vein.  The offender was sentenced to a minimum term of 7 years with an additional term of 3 years.  The case does not fall in the category of serious domestic attacks of the kind in the present case.  
77R v Sinclair (NSWCCA, 4 March 1998, unreported) is distinguishable on the same basis.  That was a case in which the offender stabbed a person known to him after an argument at a pub about an alleged debt.  The offender was sentenced to a minimum term of 5 years with an additional term of two years.
78In R v Glencourse (1995) 78 A Crim R 256, the offender and the victim had been in a relationship which was in the process of breaking down.  There had been some earlier incidents involving violence.  On the evening of the offence, the victim allowed the offender to stay at her house but refused his sexual advances and went to sleep.  Her next recollection was of waking up to find the offender straddled over her holding a knife to the side of her neck.  He stabbed her in the stomach and neck a number of times.  He then held her on the floor with a pillow over her face, following which he threw her back on to the bed and stabbed her further.  He was found guilty by a jury.  The trial judge sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 10 years and 8 months with a minimum term of 8 years.  By majority, the Court reduced the minimum term to 7 years but did not interfere with the total sentence:  at 258 per Hunt CJ at CL; Simpson J agreeing at 260.  Bruce J (dissenting) would not have reduced the minimum term: at 267 to 268.  The Chief Judge at Common Law described the sentence of 10 years and 8 months as one which was undoubtedly severe, but within the limits of the trial judge's wide sentencing discretion.
79In R v Quach [2002] NSWCCA 173, the offender began to suspect that his wife was having an extra-marital affair.  He attacked her in their bedroom with a bottle.  He struck her several times on the head, saying that he wanted to kill her because she did not respect him.  She struggled and tried to escape but he gagged her with a rag, tied her legs and hands and held her captive in the bedroom for several hours.  She lost a great deal of blood and lapsed into unconsciousness at some stage.  He refused to obtain medical assistance for her until their children returned from school.  Even then, it evidently took the children some time to convince him to call an ambulance.  She sustained a fractured skull and other injuries.  He was convicted by a jury and sentenced by the trial judge to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 4 years.  The judge found special circumstances such as to warrant the imposition of a balance of term exceeding one third of the non-parole period, as required under s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  In rejecting an appeal against severity, the Court described the sentence as falling towards the lower end of the scale considering the seriousness of the circumstances in which the offence was committed.  
80The only case relied upon by the applicant that was decided after the introduction of standard non-parole periods was R v Zegura [2006] NSWCCA 230.  The offender in that case pleaded guilty.  Following the breakdown of a relationship, and in the face of some reluctance on the part of the victim to see the offender (owing to her fear of him), the offender visited the victim in the company of his sister and invited her to go out for a coffee with them.  Taking comfort from the presence of the sister, the victim agreed.  She went into her bedroom to get changed.  The offender followed her and stabbed her in the stomach about ten times.  She tried to protect herself and so was also stabbed in the hand.  He also punched her to the head and face several times and bit her on the shoulder.  The victim managed to escape and the offender remained in her house for approximately five and a half hours.  After police surrounded the house, the offender lit a number of fires.  In addition to the offence of wounding with intent to murder, he pleaded guilty to maliciously destroying property by means of fire.  He was sentenced for the wounding offence to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months.  For the offence of maliciously destroying property by fire he was sentenced to a fixed term of 18 months accumulated by 6 months, giving a total sentence of 9 years.  
81In a Crown appeal, the Court described the sentence passed in respect of the wounding with intent to murder as lenient but still within the range.  The Court interfered with the sentences to the limited extent of increasing the degree of accumulation between the two terms of imprisonment, giving an aggregate non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months with a head sentence of 10 years.  
82It may be accepted that, by comparison with those six decisions, the sentence imposed upon the applicant was extremely stern.
83The Crown relied on the decision of this Court in R v Macadam-Kellie [2001] NSWCCA 170.  That was also a matter determined prior to the introduction of standard non-parole periods.  The offender and his estranged wife were due to appear in the Family Law Court on the day of the offence. There was an apprehended violence order in place.  The offender waited near the Court and, when the victim arrived, approached her and produced a knife.  He later told a psychiatrist that his intention was to persuade her to come back to him.  He denied planning to kill her.  The victim ran screaming from the offender and he ran after her, caught her in the middle of the road and stabbed her in the right arm and in her back.  She fell to the ground where he stabbed her a further three times in the stomach.  He then dropped the knife and fled.  He pleaded guilty to the offence of wounding with intent to murder.  He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years.  
84Finding that the trial judge had erred in rejecting a link between the offender's major depression and his offending conduct, the Court of Criminal Appeal reduced the sentence to a term of 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years: at [64] per Greg James J; Wood CJ at CL agreeing at [1].  The reduced sentence reflected a discount of 15% for the plea of guilty, giving a starting point of 17 years and about 7 months for the head sentence and almost 13 years for the non-parole period.
85The applicant submitted that the offending conduct in Macadam-Kellie was ""outrageous"" and not comparable with his own conduct.  He noted that the offence in Macadam-Kellie was committed whilst there was an apprehended violence order in place.  That was certainly an aggravating feature of the offence which did not exist in the present case (there had been a history of domestic violence, including death threats, in the present case but evidently no protection order was sought).
86The applicant also relied on the fact that, in Macadam-Kellie, the offender ambushed the victim and ran after her when she tried to escape.  Those circumstances are indistinguishable from the present case, in my view.  The applicant effectively ambushed Ms Cvetkovic, producing the gyprock saw only after she had seated herself in the driver's seat of the car and fastened the seatbelt.  He had no need to run after her because she could not escape.  He continued to stab her in the back many times whilst she tried to do so.  He ignored her pleas for him to stop.  The Court of Appeal described the conduct of the offender in Macadam-Kellie as falling ""little short in culpability of the completed crime"" (at [42]), a finding echoed by the trial judge in the present case (at ROS12).
87As found by the trial judge, this was a very serious offence falling little short in culpability of the offence of murder.  A severe sentence was warranted.  Although I would regard the sentence passed on the applicant as being stern, to a degree perhaps reflecting the absence of any persuasion in favour of the applicant at the proceedings on sentence, I have ultimately not been persuaded that the sentence falls outside the proper range or that the trial judge's sentencing discretion otherwise miscarried.  
88In particular, I am not persuaded that the alleged excessiveness of the sentence reveals error in placing excessive weight on the element of premeditation or inadequate weight on the applicant's depressed mental state.  The trial judge had the benefit of hearing all of the evidence and absorbing the atmosphere of the trial.  The advantage enjoyed by a trial judge on that account in assessing the appropriate weight to be given to the various factors relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence is jealously guarded by this Court and should not lightly be overridden.  On a principled approach, that is so whether a sentence appears, upon review, to be stern or lenient.  In the absence of error, the sentence should stand.     
89For those reasons, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
90Schmidt J:  I agree with McCallum J.

2761206,R v Sean Lee King [2013] NSWSC 448,"Judgment
INTRODUCTION
1An indictment has been presented against Sean Lee King (""the accused"") alleging that on 10 July 2011 he did murder Jazmin-Jean Ajbschitz (""the deceased""). At the time of his arraignment on 5 October 2012 the accused pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder but guilty to the charge of manslaughter. That plea was not accepted by the Crown in satisfaction of the indictment. 

2The accused's trial is listed commence before me on 8 April 2013.

3By notice of motion filed on 19 March 2013 the accused has made application for an order pursuant to s. 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (""the Act"") that he be tried by judge alone. 

4The application is opposed by the Crown. 

5At the outset of his submissions Mr Stratton SC, who appeared on behalf of the accused, drew my attention to provisions of s. 132A of the Act and pointed out that because the present application was brought by the accused less than 28 days before the date fixed for trial, the leave of the court was required. The Crown did not oppose a grant of leave.

THE CROWN CASE
6The following summary is taken from the written submissions provided by the Crown on the hearing of the present application. Mr Stratton, in written submissions provided in response, took no issue with the outline of the case set out in the Crown's submissions. 

7The accused and the deceased met in 2009 and formed a relationship. That relationship was a volatile one, marred by violence. On the afternoon of Sunday 10 July 2011 the deceased met with two friends before going to her mother's premises which were located in an apartment block at 444 Harris Street, Ultimo. The deceased and her friends arrived there at about 6:50pm.

8Following their arrival, the deceased received a number of telephone calls from the accused. Following some of those calls, the deceased appeared shaking and angry. On one occasion, having answered a call from the accused, the deceased placed her phone on loud speaker and the accused was heard to say:

""You just wait Jazi, you don't know what I'm going to do, I am on my way to your Dad's house now"".

9About 20 minutes later the deceased answered a further call from the accused which again was put on loud speaker, at which time the accused was heard to say:

""Jazi, you don't know, you think I am joking, you don't know what I can do, I will come over, I will kill you, I will kill anybody that you are with.""

10At about 7:41pm that evening, having received such calls from the accused, the deceased telephoned her mother and expressed fears for her safety. 

11At the time of making those calls the accused had been travelling into the city with a friend, Adam Dark (""Dark""). He and Dark arrived in the city between about 8:00pm and 8:30pm and as the accused was not certain how to get to the address in Harris Street, he parked his car and caught a taxi. 

12CCTV footage establishes that having arrived at 444 Harris Street, the accused and Dark went to the front door of the apartment block and attempted to gain entry. They were initially unsuccessful in those attempts, due to the fact that a swipe card was required to unlock the door. However at 9:03pm they managed to enter the building by following another resident who was going inside. Having caught the lift to Level 5 with that resident, the accused and Dark knocked on the door of several of the apartments, enquiring of the occupants of such apartments as to their knowledge of the deceased, and/or their knowledge of her then whereabouts.

13Having been unsuccessful in locating the deceased, the accused and Dark left the apartment block at about 9:20pm. A short time later the two friends who had been with the deceased also departed the premises, as a consequence of which the deceased was left alone.

14The accused returned to the apartment block at about 10:00pm. He attempted to use the intercom system and was then seen to speak into his mobile telephone. CCTV footage establishes that the deceased approached the front door of the apartment block from the inside at about 10:03pm. She and the accused appeared to argue through the door before the deceased opened it and walked outside. She and the accused spoke for a short time before entering the building and then entering the elevator. 

15Between 10:00pm and 11:00pm a number of occupants of neighbouring apartments heard noises emanating from the direction of the apartment of the deceased's mother. One noise was described as persistent thudding, in the nature of the kind of noise which might result from furniture being moved and banged against a wall. Another noise was described as being akin to a ""slow stomp"". The noises continued for about three minutes. It is the Crown case that between 10:05pm and 10:31pm the accused murdered the deceased inside the apartment by repeatedly beating her, kicking her and stomping on her.


16There is evidence of the accused having been identified by the resident of the apartment block behind whom he and Dark first gained access. He was also identified by one of the residents with whom he enquired as to the deceased's whereabouts. Both residents told police that in their respective opinions, neither the accused nor Dark appeared to be substantially intoxicated. 

17It is not necessary, for present purposes, to further summarise the nature of the Crown case against the accused, or the evidence upon which the Crown will rely. 

THE EVIDENCE ON THE PRESENT APPLICATION
18The notice of motion filed by the accused is supported by two affidavits and one statement, all of which were admitted without objection.

19The first affidavit is that of the accused sworn on 15 March 2013. For the purposes of the present application the following paragraphs of that affidavit are of particular relevance:


""6. My level of intoxication is an essential issue in the trial. It will be argued on my behalf that given my level of intoxication I was unable to form the requisite intent to murder.

7. The case for the defense (sic) will be based on expert pharmacological and psychiatric evidence.

8. Pre-trial media coverage and online discussion that is widely available contains information that would be inadmissible at trial and/or will prejudice my trial.

9. It is in the interests of justice that an order for trial by judge alone be made.

20The second affidavit is that of Benjamin Andrew Jamieson, a solicitor in the employ of Gregory Goold, who is the solicitor for the accused. Annexed to Mr Jamieson's affidavit were the partial results of an internet search which was carried out using the words ""Sean King murder"". The first of the documents annexed to the affidavit, being a document obtained directly as a consequence of the search, produced links to a total of ten (10) articles published on the internet, of which five (5) relate to the charge against the accused. Although not specifically stated in the affidavit, I infer from the series of numbers at the foot of that page that the links to articles produced as a result of that search, including those relevant to the charges against the accused, are not limited to, and in all likelihood extend beyond, those links which are set out on that page. 

21Also annexed to Mr Jamieson's affidavit are copies of three particular articles published on the internet relating to the proceedings against the accused. It is apparent that those articles were published at a time when the proceedings against the accused were still before the Local Court. My attention was drawn, in particular, to the second of those articles published in the on line edition of the ""Inner West Courier"", the headline of which reads:

""CRIME: Man accused of Ultimo murder was on bail at the time of the crime"".

22The article goes on to record the fact that the accused was on bail at the time of the deceased's death in respect of two counts of assault. It should be noted that I was informed in the course of submissions that those offences may be the subject of an application by the Crown pursuant to ss. 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act. However as no such application has yet been made, I have proceeded to determine the present issue on the basis that evidence of such matters will not be before the jury at the trial. 

23Finally, a statement of John Andrew Farrar, a Forensic Pharmacologist, was tendered. For the purposes of providing a statement, Mr Farrar was provided with a series of documents including what were described as ""instructions from the accused"". Based, at least in part, upon a history apparently provided by the accused as to his consumption of Methylamphetamine and alcohol in the hours leading up to the deceased's death, Mr Farrar expressed the opinion that the ability of the accused to form an intention to kill the deceased would have been substantially impaired. 

24Mr Farrar was also provided with statements of four named persons who, I infer, are likely to be called to give evidence at the trial in the defence case to support the history provided by the accused to Mr Farrar.

THE LEGISLATION
25Section 132 of the Act is in the following terms:

132 Orders for trial by Judge alone 

(1) An accused person or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court may apply to the court for an order that the accused person be tried by a Judge alone (a 
""trial by judge order"" ). 

(2) The court must make a trial by judge order if both the accused person and the prosecutor agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone. 

(3) If the accused person does not agree to being tried by a Judge alone, the court must not make a trial by judge order. 

(4) If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so. 

(5) Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness. 

(6) The court must not make a trial by judge order unless it is satisfied that the accused person has sought and received advice in relation to the effect of such an order from an Australian legal practitioner. 

(7) The court may make a trial by judge order despite any other provision of this section or section 132A if the court is of the opinion that: 

(a) there is a substantial risk that acts that may constitute an offence under Division 3 of Part 7 of the Crimes Act 1900 are likely to be committed in respect of any jury or juror, and 

(b) the risk of those acts occurring may not reasonably be mitigated by other means.

THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES
26Mr Stratton commenced his submissions by making reference to the provisions of s. 132(4) of the Act. He drew attention to the court's discretionary power to make an order for a judge-alone trial ""if it considers that it is in the interests of justice to do so."" He submitted that one of the paramount considerations encompassed by the phrase ""interests of justice"" (although not the sole consideration) was the right of the accused to a fair trial (see Chapman v Gentle (1986) 28 A Crim R 29). 

27Concentrating upon the fact that the principal issue in the trial is the accused's intention, Mr Stratton pointed out that the provisions of s. 132(5) of the Act did not specifically include that issue as one which required the application of objective community standards. He also drew my attention to the terms of the Second Reading Speech of the then Attorney-General which similarly did not include any such reference. These factors, he submitted, reflected the aim of the Parliament that an issue of intention should not be regarded as being one to which it was necessary to apply objective community standards. Mr Stratton sought to contrast the present position with one in which the issue for determination might be one of indecency or dishonesty and where the application of such standards would obviously be relevant. All of these factors, he submitted, supported the conclusion that it was in the interests of justice that the order sought be granted. 

28Mr Stratton then advanced four specific submissions, all of which were said to prejudice the right of the accused to a fair trial and which, for that reason, were said to support the making of the order sought.

29Firstly, he relied upon the evidence annexed to the affidavit of Mr Jamieson concerning the publicity which the proceedings have attracted to date. Whilst he accepted that the publicity was perhaps not as extensive as is often the case in matters of this nature, he pointed to two particular factors which he submitted were significant. The first was the ease with which a basic search had produced material of the kind annexed to Mr Jamieson's affidavit. The second was the fact that even a simple search of that nature would reveal, if it were undertaken by any potential juror, the fact that the accused was on bail for offences of violence at the time of the deceased's death.

30Mr Stratton then submitted that it was inevitable that there would be photographic evidence depicting the deceased's injuries which would be relied upon by the Crown, and which a jury would find distressing. This, he submitted, gave rise to a danger of unfair prejudice being visited upon the accused.

31Thirdly, Mr Stratton submitted that the accused's admitted use of Methylamphetamine, and the effects of such use upon him, which were matters pivotal to the defence case and which would necessarily be disclosed in the evidence, would likely, if not inevitably, give rise to prejudice on the part of at least some members of the jury.

32Finally, Mr Stratton drew a comparison between the likely course, and length, of a trial before a jury on the one hand, and a trial before a judge alone on the other. Although the estimate which was provided at the time at which the trial was set down was one of 3 weeks, Mr Stratton expressed some significant reservations about the likelihood of a trial before a jury being completed within that time frame. In contrast, he submitted that a trial before a judge alone would occupy far less court time, thereby saving substantial cost to the community. He further submitted that proceeding in that way would ensure the most efficient use of the resources which are available. 

33In particular, Mr Stratton pointed to the fact that the Crown brief contained statements of more than 100 witnesses which, when combined with the case for the accused, would likely mean a trial in excess of the present three week estimate. In comparison, he submitted that were the trial to proceed before a judge alone, it was likely that less than five prosecution witnesses would be required to give oral evidence, the balance of the Crown brief being able to be tendered.

34The Crown accepted that the principal issue in the trial concerned the intention of the accused and that, as a result, there would be expert evidence relied upon both by the Crown and the accused. However, the Crown submitted that such expert evidence was not likely to be overly complex, nor was it likely to be lengthy. 

35In terms of the provisions of s. 132(5) of the Act, and in particular in terms of the reference within those provisions to issues requiring the application of objective community standards, the Crown pointed out that the particular issues which were enumerated in the section were not expressed to be exhaustive. In this regard, the Crown relied, in particular, upon observations made by Heydon J in AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; (2008) 232 CLR 438 where his Honour, in reference to s. 118(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2004 (WA) (which was in substantially similar terms to the provisions of s. 132(5) of the Act) said (at [95]; 473):

""Other examples of factual issues requiring the application of ""objective community standards"" include ... whether an accused person had a particular intention.""

36In terms of the prejudice which was said by the accused to be likely as a consequence of the media and internet coverage to date, the Crown submitted that this was an issue which could be appropriately dealt with by directions to the jury. In this regard, the Crown relied upon a number of authorities which, it was submitted, supported the conclusion that a criminal trial is founded, at least in part, upon the proposition that a jury will apply directions of law which are given to them by a trial judge: Gilbert v R (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [31]; R v Dudko (2002) 132 A Crim R 371; R v D'Arcy (2003) 140 A Crim R 303; R v Burrell [2004] NSWCCA 336; and R v Jamal (2008) 72 NSWLR 258; (2008) 191 A Crim R 1. 

37The Crown also relied upon those authorities in two other respects. The first was in response to the submission made on behalf of the accused that prejudice would arise as a consequence of the disclosure, in any defence case, of his admitted use of illicit drugs. The second was in response to the submission concerning the likelihood of prejudice arising from the tender of photographs of the deceased. In respect of both of these issues, the Crown submitted that the matter could be dealt with by appropriate directions. Further, and specifically as to the second issue, the Crown indicated that quite apart from the fact that the use of photographic evidence depicting injuries to a deceased was not unusual in matters of this nature, the use of such material in the accused's trial would be minimal in any event. 

38Finally, the Crown accepted, as a general proposition, that a trial before a judge alone would take less time to complete than would be the case if it were to proceed before a jury. As I understood it, the Crown's present estimate of the trial, on the assumption that it proceeds before a jury is 3 weeks, or perhaps a little longer. However, the Crown did not accept that a trial before a judge alone would be completed within the time frame suggested by Mr Stratton, and pointed to the fact that the evidence of those witnesses whom the Crown would wish to call would still occupy considerable court time. 

39Further, and in any event, the Crown submitted that the fact that court time might be saved, and resources better used, if the matter were to proceed before a judge alone were not relevant to the issue that I was required to determine. In that regard, the Crown placed particular reliance upon the decision of McClellan CJ at CL (as his Honour then was) in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; (2012) 217 A Crim R 1 (at [111]; 28). 

THE RELEVANT PRINCIPLES
40In R v Belghar (supra) the Court of Criminal Appeal considered, in some detail, the provisions of s. 132 of the Act, albeit against a different factual background to that which applies in the present case. Having undertaken an exhaustive review of the relevant authorities McClellan CJ at CL made a number of important observations. 

41Firstly, his Honour said (at [96]; 25):

""Although s 131 provides for trial by jury ""except as otherwise provided"", I do not think that the section has the effect of creating a ""presumption"" that the trial should be with a jury, thereby casting a burden of proof on an accused person. Although the accused person carries an evidentiary onus the court does not determine where the interests of justice lie by requiring the evidence to rise to a level by which a ""presumption"" of trial by jury is displaced. Each mode of trial has its particular characteristics and, accordingly, depending on all of the circumstances relating to the particular case, the court may conclude that the interests of justice are best served by a judge-alone trial rather than trial by a jury. Of course, absent an application by an accused person, the default position will be that the trial must take place with a jury. And, no doubt, when considering where the interests of justice lie, it will be relevant that where the trial involves an issue which may be informed by community standards or expectations the interests of justice may be best served by utilising a jury of laypeople. Subsection (5) acknowledges this consideration. However, I see no reason why the legislation otherwise requires particular weight to be given to the fact that, absent an application for a judge-alone trial, the trial will be with a jury as opposed to by a judge alone. The question for the court is whether it considers it is in the interests of justice to make the order.""

42His Honour went on to say (at [99]; 26):

""In so far as the origin of a trial by jury was to provide a protection for the accused, in that he or she would be tried by their peers, where the accused applies in accordance with s 132 for a judge-alone trial, it is plain that the accused has, with proper advice, determined that the protection is not required. For this reason the subjective views of an accused and his or her belief that a jury trial may not be fair, as reflected in his or her desire to dispense with a jury, must be a relevant factor...""

43His Honour further observed (at [100]; 26) that although it was not a circumstance which applied in that particular case, the fact that it would be preferable in the interests of justice that there should be a trial by jury where an alleged offence involves the application of objective community standards had been made plain by the Parliament in enacting s. 132(5).

44His Honour also observed (at [102]; 26-27):

""The granting of an application on the mere apprehension of prejudice in prospective jurors, not based on evidence or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice (Evidence Act 1995 s 144), is at odds with the assumption which the common law makes that jurors will understand and obey the instructions of trial judges to bring an impartial mind to bear on their verdict: Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [13] (Gleeson CJ and Gummow J). The fact that an accused person desires a trial by judge alone, although relevant, is not as significant as the reasons for that preference and whether those reasons are rationally justified and bear upon whether he or she will receive a fair trial.""

45In this context, his Honour went on to observe (at [107]; 27-28) that it is to be assumed that the protections afforded an accused person in the ordinary course of a trial will protect him or her from an unjust result. His Honour noted that such protections included the practice that before jurors are selected, each member of the panel will be reminded of their obligation to bring an impartial mind to their decision, and after being informed of the alleged offence, the identity of the accused and the nature of the issues in the trial, asked to consider whether they can fairly consider the relevant issues. 

46His Honour ultimately came to the view that the primary judge had fallen into error in his approach to the application, and concluded that decision to order a judge alone trial should be quashed. The other members of the court (Hidden J and Hislop J) agreed that the primary judge had fallen into error and agreed with the orders of McClellan CJ at CL. Both, however, stated a preference not to express any concluded view about the wider issues raised as a consequence of the examination, by McClellan CJ at CL of the authorities. Relevantly however, Hidden J said (at [29]-[30]; [118]):

""I think it is unhelpful to speak about a presumption or an onus when an application is made by an accused for trial by judge alone. The statutory scheme created by ss 131 and 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act is that a trial on indictment is normally by jury, and it is for the accused to raise material which might lead to the conclusion that it is in the interests of justice to depart from that mode of trial. It is then a matter for the judge to determine where the interests of justice lie in all the circumstances of the case, and the approach of the parties to the matter should not be adversarial. While the history of trial by jury suggests that the institution has been for the protection of the accused, it is clear that s 132(4) recognises that there is a community interest in trial by jury which in a particular case might override the accused's preference for a judge alone trial. So much is spelt out in subs (5). To adopt the words of Chesterman JA in R v Fardon [2010] QCA 317, an accused cannot have a trial by judge alone ""for the asking"".""


CONSIDERATION OF THE ISSUES
47The ultimate question for determination is whether or not I consider that it is in the interests of justice to grant the application made by the accused for a trial before a judge alone. 

48I am unable to accept Mr Stratton's submission concerning the provisions of s. 132(5) of the Act. It is correct that the issue of intention is not expressly included within the section as one requiring the application of objective community standards. It is also correct that there was no reference to such a matter in the Second Reading Speech. However, it will be evident from the terms of the section, and specifically from the use of the words ""including (but not limited to)"", that the categories of issues which might require the application of community standards are not expressed to be exhaustive, and are therefore not closed. 

49As I have previously noted the Crown relied upon observations made by Heydon J in AK (supra). The issue for determination by the court in that case arose from an asserted failure on the part of a trial judge to provide a decision, following a judge alone trial, which met the relevant criteria set out in the Criminal Procedure Act 2004 (WA). In those circumstances, Heydon J's observations were necessarily obiter. Further, Mr Stratton submitted that although his Honour was in the majority, his observations were not commented upon, much less adopted by, any other member of the Court. However that does not mean that they should be completely ignored. 

50In a footnote to his observation that an issue of intention was one that required the application of community standards, Heydon J made reference to a paper entitled ""Some Simple Thoughts on Intention"" [1988] Criminal Law Review 484 at 485 (Buxton) which contained the following:

""[R]ecourse to shared values and assumptions about the implications of actions and the circumstances in which those actions occur may be a safer guide to culpability than analytical deductions from a generalised verbal definition"".

51In the present case, the Crown will submit that the jury would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused formed one of the two specific intentions applicable to a charge of murder. In doing so, the Crown will submit to the jury that they should reject the proposition that the accused's level of intoxication was such as to impair his ability to form the requisite intention. The evidence upon which those submissions will be based will not be confined to expert evidence. Leaving aside the content of the telephone conversations (which the Crown will submit exhibit an intention of the part of the accused to kill the deceased) the Crown will also invite the jury to draw inferences from aspects of the accused's behaviour, both before and after the deceased's death, which it will submit are inconsistent with an inability to form the necessary intention.

52In determining whether there is an issue which requires the application of an objective community standard, the circumstances of the particular trial must be taken into account. The various matters to which I have referred all combine to form part of the circumstances in which the Crown will submit that the accused killed the deceased, intending to kill her, or intending to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her. Viewed in that way, the circumstances of the case put by the Crown, and the issue of intention in particular, will attract the application of objective community standards in the sense contemplated by Heydon J. In particular, the jury will be asked to have recourse to their shared values about the circumstances in which the accused's actions occurred, as well as the implications of those actions. In my view, the fact that in Belghar the issue was one of intention, and the fact that McClellan CJ at CL observed (at [100]) that such issue did not, in the circumstances of that case, require the application of community standards, does not lead to the conclusion that this will always be the case when an issue of intention is raised. 

53As I have pointed out, s. 132(5) does not seek to limit the categories of issue to which a relevant standard might be applied. Further, just as it does not seek to limit the categories of factual issues themselves, the section does not limit the court, in determining whether it is in the interests of justice to make an order for a judge-alone trial, to a consideration of whether or not the trial will involve such a factual issue. McClellan CJ at CL pointed out in Belghar that where such a factual issue does arise Parliament has expressed a preference for trial by jury. Equally however, whether a trial will involve such a factual issue is one of a number of factors which the court is entitled to take into account in determining the ultimate question of whether it is in the interests of justice to make an order under s. 132. 

54I have had regard to the views expressed by the accused in his affidavit, particularly as to the prejudice he claims he will suffer as a consequence of the pre-trial publicity to date. I unreservedly accept that the right of an accused person to a fair trial necessarily forms part, and indeed an important part, of the broader interests of justice. However, I do not accept that the nature and extent of the publicity which the trial has attracted thus far supports a conclusion that it is in the interests of justice that an order for a judge alone-trial be made. 

55Proceedings such as these will invariably attract some publicity. The nature and extent of that publicity will vary according to a number of factors. It is to be expected that an internet search using the name of the accused coupled with the word ""murder"" would, if undertaken, produce links to a number of articles which record earlier stages of the proceedings. The articles annexed to Mr Jamieson's affidavit obviously make reference to some matters which, it can be anticipated, will form part of the evidence in the trial. Equally, as Mr Stratton submitted, they make reference to matters which will not be the subject of any evidence at the trial, including the fact that at the time of the deceased's death, the accused had been charged with, and was on bail in respect of, other offences of violence. 

56The potential impact, upon a criminal trial, of articles published on the internet has been the subject of judicial observation. In R v K (2003) 59 NSWLR 431 Wood CJ at CL said (at 448; [80]-[82]):

""The case is one of potential ongoing importance, having regard to the extent of the information which is now available on the internet, concerning criminal investigations and trials, not only via online media reports and services, but also via legal databases and the judgment systems of the Courts. The problem is compounded by the greater familiarity which the current generation has with the use of information technology, and the ever reducing cost of acquiring and using that technology.

It may well become the case, as a matter of habit arising out of the way that ordinary affairs are conducted, that the inevitable reaction of any person who is summonsed as a juror, will be to undertake an online search in relation to the case, to ascertain what it may involve.

It is not possible to place any practicable limit on the content or the extent of the material available in this way, and the powers of the Courts to place effective restrictions on the publication of their own proceedings is severely limited...""


57Subsequently, in a paper entitled ""The Internet and the right to a fair trial"" (2005) 29 Crim LJ 331 Spigelman CJ observed:

""The right to a fair trial is protected by numerous specific practices and rules that have developed over the course of centuries of practical experience involving adaptation to changing circumstances in accordance with the classic common law process. The internet is only the most recent technological
challenge requiring a new course of pragmatic adaptation of our procedures.""

58Although, as Wood CJ at CL observed, the powers of the court to limit the availability of material published on the internet are minimal, some practices have been adopted which form part of the ""course of pragmatic adaptation"" of the court's procedures to which Spigelman CJ referred. One is the practice of trial judges, at the commencement of any trial, to direct the jury that they are prohibited from undertaking any research, or making any enquiry, through the internet, in relation to any aspect of the trial, be it the identity of the accused, the identity of any person named in the course of the evidence, or a variety of other matters. In this regard Spigelman CJ said (at 334):

""Model instructions for the jury have long contained references to the jury not to conduct their own research. Many of them now contain express references to searching the internet as well as refraining from using other reference material such as dictionaries.""

59Needless to say, directions in these terms will be given to the jury at the commencement of the accused's trial. 

60Further, and in light of the submission as to the publication, on the internet, of the fact that the accused was on bail for offences of violence at the material time, it is also relevant to note that in K (supra) Wood CJ at CL observed (at 446) that there have been instances in the past in which the fact that a jury member had knowledge of past convictions, or of alleged criminal behaviour on the part of an accused person, had not been regarded as being sufficient to establish bias (see R v Booth; R v Box [1964] 1 QB 430; R v Hood [1968] 1 WLR 773; [1968] 2 All ER 56).

61Moreover, the Parliament has seen fit to enact s. 68C of the Jury Act 1977 which renders it an offence for any juror to make an enquiry for the purpose of obtaining any information about the accused, or any matters relevant to the trial, except in the proper exercise of his or her functions. A reference to the provisions of 68C will necessarily be incorporated in the directions to which I have referred which will be given to the jury at the commencement of the accused's trial. Such directions will also include a direction concerning the obligation of all members of the jury to decide the case solely on the evidence. All of these directions will be repeated at appropriate stages in the course of the trial, as well as in the summing up. 

62Bearing all of these matters in mind there is, as the Crown pointed out, a long line of authority which unequivocally supports the proposition that it is to be assumed that jurors will follow directions which are given to them by a trial judge. In Gilbert v R (2000) 201 CLR 414 McHugh J explained the proposition in this way (at 425):

""The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint words of the ancient oath, they hearken to the evidence and that they obey the trial judge's directions. On that assumption, which I regard as fundamental to the criminal jury trial, the Common Law countries have staked a great deal. If it was rejected or disregarded, no one - accused, trial judge or member of the public - could have any confidence in any verdict of a criminal jury or in the criminal justice system whenever it involves the jury trial. If it was rejected or disregarded, the pursuit of justice through the jury system would be as much a charade as the show trial of any totalitarian state. Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having a criminal jury trial...In my respectful opinion, the fundamental assumption of the criminal jury trial requires us to proceed on the basis that the jury acted in this case on the evidence and in accordance with the judge's directions and that they would have done so even if manslaughter had been left as an issue, as it should have been left.""


63Observations to a similar effect had previously been expressed by Mason CJ and Toohey J in R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 (at 603):

""The possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial. The law acknowledges the existence of that possibility but proceeds on the footing that the jury, acting in conformity with the instructions given to them by the trial judge, will render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence. As Toohey J. observed in Hinch v Attorney General (Vic) (1987) 164 CLR 15, at p 74, in the past too little weight may have been given to the capacity of jurors to assess critically what they see and hear and their ability to reach their decisions by reference to the evidence before them. In Murphy v R (1989) 167 CLR 94, we stated at p 99:

'But it is misleading to think that, because a juror hasheard something of the circumstances giving rise to thetrial, the accused has lost the opportunity of anindifferent jury. The matter was put this way by theOntario Court of Appeal in Reg. v. Hubbert(1975) 29 CCC (2d) 279, at p 291: 'In this era of rapid dissemination of news by the various media, it would be naive to think that in the case of a crime involving considerable notoriety, it would be possible to select 12 jurors who had not heard anything about the case. Prior information about a case, and even the holding of a tentative opinion about it, does not make partial a juror sworn to render a true verdict according to the evidence'.

To conclude otherwise is to underrate the integrity of the system of trial by jury and the effect on the jury of the instructions given by the trial judge"".

64The statements in Glennon were expressly adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Lodhi v R [2007] NSWCCA 360; (2007) 179 A Crim R 470 at [153] per Barr J (Spigelman CJ and Price J agreeing). 

65In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that the publicity surrounding the matter thus far supports a conclusion that it is in the interests of justice to grant the order sought. Put simply, the jury will be given comprehensive directions and, on the basis of the authorities to which I have referred, it will be assumed that they will follow and apply them.

66Further, the fact that the Crown may tender photographs depicting the injuries occasioned to the deceased is not, in my view, a circumstance which supports the making of the order. Although none of the photographs which may be relied upon by the Crown at trial were tendered before me on the present application, it hardly needs to be said that in a matter of this nature, evidence of that kind almost invariably forms part of the evidence upon which the Crown will rely. In these circumstances, two particular matters warrant emphasis. 

67Firstly, the jury will be directed in terms which will emphasise the need to disregard any strong emotional response to any of the evidence, and to act according to reason. It is to be assumed, for the reasons that I have previously stated, that the jury will act upon those directions.

68Secondly, in the particular circumstances of this case, it would appear that the Crown's reliance on such evidence will be minimal in any event. When this issue was raised in the course of submissions, I expressed to the Crown my firm expectation that in circumstances where there is no issue that the accused act(s) caused the death of the deceased, any reliance upon photographs depicting the deceased's injuries should be kept to a minimum. The Crown responded by indicating that she had formed a preliminary view that it would, in all likelihood, be sufficient to lead evidence of the deceased's injuries by description, rather than by the tendering of photographs. I am therefore satisfied that the use of photographs by the Crown will be limited. Further, and as I have indicated, the jury will be given appropriate directions in any event.

69Similarly, to the extent that the accused may make some admission as to the ingestion of some illegal narcotic appropriate, directions will be given to the jury that no adverse inference should be drawn from that fact alone.

70As to Mr Stratton's submission that a trial before a judge alone would be substantially shorter than would be the case if it were to proceed before a jury, there are, as I have noted, differing views about how long a trial before a judge alone might take, in comparison to the time which would be taken if the matter was before a jury. That said, the parties seem to agree that if the matter were to proceed before a jury, it would be unlikely to be completed within the original estimate of 3 weeks. Estimates as to the length of trials can often vary. They can also prove to be wildly inaccurate. I am prepared to accept that a trial before a judge alone would, by its very nature, be likely to take less time that would be the case if the matter were to proceed before a jury. However, I am simply unable to determine, with any precision, to what extent this might be the case. 

71In Belghar (supra) McClellan CJ at CL said at [110]: 

""In some cases the decision of a judge to order trial by judge alone has been influenced by consideration of the efficiencies available from a judge-alone trial and the advantage available to an accused person and the community if reasons for the verdict are available from the trial judge...For my part I would accept that as part of the mix of issues which must be considered, the likely length of the trial in a particular case, if conducted with a jury, compared with the likely length of trial by a judge alone, is relevant.

The likely length of a trial may have to do with the complexity of the issues involved, the number of accused to be tried, or the number of witnesses to be called. The obligation on prospective jurors to spend many months away from their normal activities, including their employment with extremely modest monetary recompense, may be a significant matter in a particular case when determining where the interests of justice lie. Trial judges are familiar with the problems which can arise with jurors who become frustrated at their continuing involvement in a trial weeks or months after the original estimate has passed with the obvious diminishing contribution they make to understanding the evidence and the issues which require resolution.""

72The likely length of the accused's trial, and the fact that the principal (or perhaps sole) issue is that of intention, form part of the ""mix of issues"" which, his Honour concluded, are relevant to consider. However in my view, they are not matters which support the making of the order sought in the present case. A trial which is expected to be completed in about 4 weeks could not be described as overly lengthy, and is not likely to give rise to the type of difficulties to which his Honour made reference, and which can arise in longer trials. Moreover, both the Crown and senior counsel for the accused appear to agree that there will essentially be one issue. In my view, that issue could not be regarded as an overly complex one. 

73However Mr Stratton's submission concerning the comparative lengths of the trial went further, and extended to the proposition that I should take into account the fact that a trial before a judge alone would potentially result in the saving of costs to the community, and would ensure ""the best use of scarce judicial resources"". In Belghar (supra) McClellan CJ at CL, having expressed the views set out in [110], expressly rejected (at [111]) the proposition that considerations of efficiency of operation of the judicial system were relevant in determining an application under s. 132. His Honour said:

""However, I would not accept that the interests of justice in s 132 can be informed by considerations of the overall efficiencies in the operation of a court which may be available from a judge-alone trial. No doubt they are important issues for the administration of justice and may ultimately lead to further legislative intervention but, as the majority determined in Pambula Hospital, they are not relevant to the interests of justice in the particular case.""

74The decision of the Court of Appeal in Pambula District Hospital v Herriman (1988) 14 NSWLR 387 to which his Honour referred was one where the court considered the provisions of s. 89(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1970 which empowered the court to order that issues of fact in a civil case be tried without a jury. Kirby P observed (at 402-403):

""The basic flaw in (the primary judge's) reasoning was in considering to be relevant as such, universal characteristics of jury trials. This was impermissible because the scheme of the legislation assumes that jury trials will continue to be available for proceedings on a common law claim such as this... It is therefore not to the point to consider universal characteristics of jury trials. They must be taken to have been known to, and accepted by,Parliament when contemplating that jury trials would continue, except where the discretion under s 89(1) of the Act was exercised.""

75Samuels JA who said (at 412-413):

""... there can be no room in the exercise of this discretionfor consideration of matters which are, as the President has put it, 'of universal application to all jury trials'. 

The undoubted circumstances the trial by jury is longer, and therefore more expensive, and procedurally more inflexible than trial by judge alone, are not to be taken into account. The legislature clearly must have determined to accommodate them when it provided that, in a particular class of case, a jury might be requisitioned by the act of one party. 

The same characteristics entail that jury trials tend to clog up the lists and impede the expeditious trial of matters to be dealt with by a judge alone. But this again is an inevitable consequence of preserving trial with a jury. It must, once more, have been intended by the legislature that these detriments must be stoically endured as the appropriate price for the continued employment of civil juries. Whether the value of the commodity is worth the expenditure in time, money, frustration and delay is a debatable question which falls, however, outside the scope of this judgment. It is also, I venture to say, outside the scope of the discretion under discussion, whose exercise cannot, to my mind, involve considerations of how the general dispatch of business in the list can best be promoted...""

76In these circumstances, I do not accept Mr Stratton's submission that it is open to me to have regard to the potential cost savings which would result from a trial before a judge alone. Similarly, it is not open to me to take into account the fact that proceeding in that manner may best utilise available resources.

77For all of these reasons I am not satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to make an order that the accused be tried by a judge alone.

ORDERS
78For the forgoing reasons I make the following orders:

(i)I grant leave to the accused, pursuant to s. 132A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, to make application, pursuant to s. 132 of that Act, for an order that he be tried by a judge alone.

(ii)I dismiss the notice of motion filed by the accused on 19 March 2013.

2761216,R v West; R v Dimitriyevich [2013] NSWDC 112,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: As a young Crown Prosecutor I asked a detective who was giving evidence whether he had much involvement with drug related crime. He looked surprised by my question. He told me that in his experience almost all crime is drug related. My experience in the criminal law since then has proved the accuracy of what that detective said. We have an example in court today. These offenders whilst under the influence of drugs and needing to buy more, or to pay off drug debts, committed a series of serious offences. They attempted to rob people inside a hotel, people who must have been scared, indeed terrified. 

2Somewhat unusually both offenders for sentence today share a common characteristic. Often when drug addicts commit crimes to get money for their drugs little regard is had to the fact that they are drug addicts because of the element of personal choice involved in choosing to use drugs in the first place. But in the case of both offenders for sentence today their addiction to drugs was contributed to by acts of violence to which they were subject. Mr West was shot by unknown assailants and Mr Dimitriyevich was stabbed also by someone unknown. Both developed post traumatic stress disorder, not surprisingly. Mr West developed a drug addiction following opiate dependence, consequent on him being treated with pain killers following being shot and Mr Dimitriyevich found that his substance abuse significantly increased after he was stabbed. So contrary to the usual approach to drug addiction I will regard the circumstance that these offenders each had a drug addiction following acts of violence committed upon them, as very much in their favour. 

3Although there are some differences in the precise nature of the offence for which the offenders are to be sentenced, they have in common an offence of attempted robbery in company they each committed together on 
30 December 2011. Before that occurred Mr West stole a motor vehicle and then filled it up with fuel without paying, both offences appearing on a Form 1 attached to his offence of attempted robbery in company. Later on 
30 December the two men met up, Mr Dimitriyevich got into the stolen car (an offence of being carried in a stolen conveyance for which he is to be sentenced,) and they went to the area of the Alfred Hotel in Camperdown. They had planned to commit an offence there. Although it may well be that the offence was more planned by Mr West than Mr Dimitriyevich the latter's involvement was not a spur of the moment decision. He took part in what I would describe as 'casing the joint' and so they must have both been well aware that when they went into the premises it would be occupied by patrons and that thus this was not simply to be a case of break, enter and steal but was to be a case of robbery.

4Mr West had with him, to Mr Dimitriyevich's knowledge, a cap gun, that is a toy gun, although it had been painted in such a way to make it look more realistic. Mr Dimitriyevich had with him a hammer, both of those items were used during the course of the offence. 

5While they were casing the hotel they were observed by the licensee. He had left the premises for a personal reason and was returning to the hotel at about 1.10am on 30 December when he noticed the two offenders acting suspiciously. When he got to the hotel he spoke about this to the security officer and so they were ready when the two offenders approached the hotel wearing balaclavas. Upon seeing this the security officer locked the front doors. The offenders thus had difficulty getting in. Mr Dimitriyevich used the hammer with which he was armed and began hitting the glass doors. Two employees of the premises locked themselves in the office area located under the hotel. Eventually Mr Dimitriyevich was successful in bashing a hole in the front door and both offenders were able to get in. They then went around the premises, in view of the patrons left inside, trying to find something to take. One or both of them, it does not really matter which, inquired about the whereabouts of a safe. Mr Dimitriyevich found a knife and used it to attempt to open the till. They were unsuccessful in obtaining access to any cash at all. 

6Police were called while the offence was occurring. When they arrived the offenders were still inside. Mr Dimitriyevich hindered police by failing to do what they requested him to do, although he gave up very soon afterwards. Mr West on the other hand did not give up easily. It will be recalled that he was armed with a toy pistol, obviously the police did not know it was a toy when it was presented to them. He was told to drop the firearm but he pointed it at police, they discharged their firearms towards Mr West, fortunately for both him and the police officers involved they missed. The offender then tried to get away. Once more he pointed the toy pistol at the police and once more they fired at him and once more they fortunately missed. 

7Nearby was the Chinese consulate. As might be expected it was well protected with, amongst other things, razor wire. The offender climbed up a wall and into the consulate premises. I should have noted that the act of pointing the toy pistol towards police in order to prevent his lawful apprehension is an offence for which the offender must be sentenced. Entering the protected premises, namely the premises involving the Chinese consulate, is also an offence, this one appearing on the Form 1. 

8Mr West cut himself quite badly on the razor wire in the events I have just described. After that he fled into a building in the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Police were able to follow droplets of blood through the hospital until they found a pool of blood in a kitchen area, the toy weapon and after some hours the offender was located, still within the hospital, and arrested. Also on the Form 1 is an offence of trespass involving the hospital.

9To complete the matters for which Mr West must be sentenced I should refer to the circumstances that at the time of this offence he was on a s 12 bond from Newtown Local Court for an offence of driving whilst disqualified. He clearly breached that bond by the commission of the offences I have described and asks that I deal with the consequences of that breach today.

10I spoke earlier about the concept of personal choice as it relates to the decision to use drugs. That idea also arises when we look at the decision of offenders to commence criminal activities. It has to be recognised that some offenders do not have the same opportunities that other luckier people in the community have, when they decide whether or not to commit crimes. 

11Mr West was denied opportunities that most other people in the community have because of the way he was brought up. He grew up in Glebe. He has no contact with his biological father although he knows that he has been incarcerated intermittently throughout his life. His mother brought up him and his three siblings, but she was unemployed and finances were limited. The home environment was described as being putrid and the necessities of life were not always available which in part motivated Mr West from a very young age to steal in order to get food in order to survive. 

12Mr West's mother was an alcoholic who was drunk every day. She simply did not care for him as she should have. On top of that she formed a relationship with a violent man, so Mr West observed domestic violence throughout his childhood. Given the chaotic and dangerous environment which existed at home Mr West quite understandably tried to spend most of his time elsewhere, living on the streets. That led to him seeking out other children in a similar position, and that in turn led to his antisocial behaviour. 

13A psychological report summarises things this way: 

""It is clear that Mr West had an abusive and neglectful childhood and adolescence marked by significant failures in parenting, he was physically abused by his mother's partner and was witness to domestic violence against his mother. Additionally his mother was an alcoholic and was apparently unable to protect him or adequately supervise him. Mr West had an unstable home environment a lack of supervision and guidance and was modelled violence with criminality from a young age."" 

14Those of us who did not experience a childhood like that were much more able to make an informed decision about our behaviour than Mr West was. Of course that is not to say that everything Mr West has done since then by way of his criminal behaviour can be forgiven. Ultimately there comes a time when Mr West, as an adult, has to take responsibility for his own actions. His actions have in the past been criminal. He has spent a great deal of time in custody and he will continue to do so until he makes the decision that he will change his ways. 

15Offences such as I have described on licensed premises are relatively prevalent. They are of course serious, causing great harm to those who experience them. Despite Mr West's terrible background, he must be punished and significantly so for his decision to commit the offences I have described. I do take into account that he was under the influence of drugs at the time, they had a disinhibiting effect of course. His prospects of rehabilitation depend largely on his prospects of overcoming his drug addiction. In his favour is the circumstance that the drug addiction was a recent onset, certainly the addiction to opioid, such as heroin was of recent onset and, with the support of services available both inside prison and upon his release from custody, there is some hope that Mr West might be able, sometime in the future upon his release from custody to live a better life. If he does not make that choice, he will, I am sure, as a significantly older man, look back on his life and realise that it has been largely wasted. Another factor I will specifically take into account is that his time in custody will be harder than would otherwise have been the case, simply because of the post traumatic stress disorder, albeit apparently in remission at times, from which he suffers. 

16As I am sure everyone in court knows, gaols are violent places. It would be bad enough to be in fear of such violence on a daily basis without post traumatic stress disorder, but having been shot, him being the victim of significant violence, I am sure that Mr West's time in custody will be harder because of that circumstance. 

17In Mr Dimitriyevich's case, his upbringing was not as bad as that of Mr West. His parents did separate and it seems that Mr Dimitriyevich took the absence of his father to heart. That caused him to act out in an antisocial way. He, again in contrast to Mr West, commenced using drugs including heroin at a relatively early age and so his drug addiction is of long standing. He too was under the influence of drugs at the time the offence was committed. I do notice the Crown submitted that there was some conflict between the history given to Dr Allnutt and the contents of the offender's ERISP on the day he was arrested but I am prepared to make a finding in the offender's favour that his decision as to whether to commit this offence or not was affected by drugs he had taken. 

18There are some factors which tend to suggest that Mr Dimitriyevich's prospects of rehabilitation are a bit brighter than they have been in the past. There are encouraging signs for the future, including him being in a relationship with a young woman who will be able to assist him once he is released from custody. He has plans for the future. In the past he has been able to hold down a job and once released from custody wants to work as a fitness trainer. Whilst in custody and apparently drug free, he has been exercising. Unfortunately it would appear that he cannot do his certificates through TAFE whilst in custody but he plans to do them upon his release from gaol and then work as a fitness trainer in the future. 

19I note that he was on three s 9 Bonds at the time of this offence. I do not know what for and nothing was presented to me to enable me to deal with them at this time, but it is of course a matter of aggravation that he was on bonds at the time he committed these offences. 

20He expressed his remorse to Dr Allnutt and, as Ms Goodwin suggested, what Dr Allnutt reports him saying did not appear to have just been some rote and automatic expression of what Mr Dimitriyevich thought he should say to benefit him. From what I can see, it appeared to be genuine.

21As with Mr West his time in custody will be harder because of his post traumatic stress disorder. The apprehension that Mr Dimitriyevich feels and the fear he has about a further random act of violence, will mean that he will never be able to truly relax whilst in custody. Again that is a matter I have taken into account in his favour.

22Of course the principle of parity arises. The offenders were dealt with together and although there were some relatively minor differences in the statements of facts prepared by the Crown in relation to each offender, it is the case that objectively the offenders' criminality was similar as regards the attempted robbery in company charge, with one slight exception, that being that the material before me satisfies me that it was Mr Dimitriyevich who was invited to participate by Mr West, rather than the other way around.

23In both cases there are special circumstances. Both offenders will benefit from an extended period of supervision whilst on parole. If they can be assisted to give up their use of drugs then not only they benefit but so does the community. They each have significant criminal histories and it will be to the community's benefit if they are able to change their ways with the assistance of the probation and parole service. 

24The offenders are sentenced as follows:

25For Mr West, firstly I revoke the order for suspension of the sentence imposed in the Newtown Local Court. I impose a non-parole period of four months for that matter to date from 30 December 2011. For the offence of using an offensive weapon in order to avoid lawful apprehension the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years to date from 29 February 2012. That is a fixed term because of the sentence I will shortly announce for the remaining matter.

26For the offence of attempted robbery in company I set a non-parole period of three years and two months to date from 28 February 2013 with a head sentence of five years, the non-parole period will expire on 27 April 2016 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. I confirm the order for disqualification from driving made in the Local Court. For the offence of drive whilst disqualified under s 166 certificate I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of six months to date from 30 December 2011.

27For Mr Dimitriyevich the offence of being knowingly carried in a stolen conveyance I impose a sentence of six months fixed term to date from 
30 December 2011. For the offence of attempted robbery in company I set a non-parole period of three years to date from 29 February 2012 and a head sentence of five years. The non-parole period will expire on 28 February 2015 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. Because the remaining non-parole period allows it the offender is referred to the compulsory drug treatment program at Parklea gaol. 

28I will also refer Mr West to the compulsory drug treatment program at Parklea gaol.

2761218,R v Taupe (No 2) [2013] NSWDC 330,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1I am sentencing Peter Taupe for three offences of aggravated sexual intercourse against a child. 

2Mr Taupe was charged with far more offences but pleaded not guilty and, after a trial before me without a jury, I found him guilty of the three offences which I am about to sentence him for. The victim in each of the offences was his stepdaughter Abbie White. Abbie White - if not Mr Taupe's stepdaughter - was certainly, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, in a position where Mr Taupe could exercise authority over her. 

3The offences all occurred some time ago. Abbie White is now a young adult. One of the offences occurred in 2000, another in the following year. The third offence occurred in 2004. 

4The first two offences were offences against s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Those two offences carry a maximum of 10 years imprisonment, which was the penalty fixed by Parliament at that stage. That is the penalty which is relevant for my purposes. 

5The third offence committed in 2004 was an offence against s 66C(4) of the same Act. Parliament had fixed at the relevant time a maximum of 12 years imprisonment to that offence. 

6It is important for a judge in sentencing an offender to say something about what the offender did which amounted to the crime so that some assessment can be made of how serious an example of that crime was committed by the offender. I set out in a judgment delivered on 19 December 2012 the circumstances of each of the crimes. I will make brief reference to the three offences that I am sentencing Mr Taupe for. 

7The first offence occurred between 1 December and 31 December 2000. Abbie White was only 12 years of age at the time. The age range for the offence committed against her was by reference to children aged between 10 and 16 years. Abbie White, therefore, was closer to the youngest age in that range rather than the oldest age in that range. Abbie White jumped into bed with Mr Taupe who was living with Abbie White's mother at the time. Peter Taupe started to touch her and then, as Abbie White said, he ""went under my underpants and would start to touch my vagina and penetrate - part the labia and penetrate me with his finger"". In fact Mr Taupe was not living with her mother at that stage but had come to visit. 

8As I said in my judgment, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Taupe had committed the crime by digitally penetrating her when she was 12 years of age. She regarded him as her father and she was under his authority. 

9The next offence occurred between [withheld] 2001. Abbie White's mother and Mr Taupe were still living separately at that stage. Mr Taupe came over for the occasion of Abbie White's birthday. She turned 13 on [withheld]. She said, and I accepted beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Taupe ""touched my vaginal area and he parted the labia and penetrated me with his finger"". She recalled that on that occasion he was ""a bit more forceful again, or aggressive, and he sort of positioned or adjusted my legs, I guess you could say"". He penetrated her vagina with one of his fingers. 

10Again I accepted beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Taupe had digitally penetrated her vagina and that she was either 12 or 13 years of age and she was under his authority at the time. 

11The last offence occurred between 1 January and 3 May 2004. Abbie White was aged 15. That was the offence committed against s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act. Being aged 15, she was right in the middle of the range of ages for that offence which is between 14 and 16 years. Mr Taupe ""progressed to put his hands over my vaginal area under my underwear, parted the labia, and penetrated me with his fingers in the vaginal area. This time he did insert a second finger"". Ms White said that it was uncomfortable and painful. She had been wearing underwear and she recalled that Peter Taupe ""removed them down to my ankles, down the lower half of my legs"". 

12Again I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he digitally penetrated her on that occasion and that she was under his authority. I convicted him of the three offences that I am now sentencing him for. 

13I have been assisted, as I was at the trial, by submissions by Mr CC Patrick of counsel, who appeared as Crown Prosecutor, and by Ms B O'Reilly of counsel, who appeared for Mr Taupe. 

14In his written submissions on sentence Mr Patrick acknowledged that when compared to other kinds of penetration, digital penetration can be regarded as a less serious form of penetration than penile penetration. That is not to say that digital penetration is in any way excusable. It is simply to say that in comparing a criminal who digitally penetrates a victim with another criminal who has full sexual intercourse with the same victim and perhaps renders her pregnant, the second is obviously a far more serious example of the same offence. The age of the victim is a relevant factor and I have already referred to Abbie White's ages at the relevant time. 

15Ms O'Reilly tendered some character references given by people for her client. All of those people were appropriately aware of the offences that he had been found guilty of. They still support Mr Taupe and acknowledge that there was no excuse for his behaviour. They point out otherwise very favourable factors about his character, such as him being hardworking, honest and diligent and being prepared to get support and help. Some of the references are from people who have known him for a very long time. 

16I also accept a submission by Mr Patrick that the fact that an offender is of good character is of less significance in child sexual assault cases. Mr Patrick referred to what Fullerton J had said in Dousha v R [2008] NSWCCA 263. At [49] her Honour said - 

""In the context of offending constituted by a course of repeat sexual offending against young children, a claim for good character does not entitle an offender to the leniency that might otherwise be available"". 

17This is a case where I am sentencing Mr Taupe for three counts of sexual assaults against the same child victim. The fact that there was other conduct that he was charged with and which I acquitted him of, does not, of course, make any unfavourable impact upon the sentence which I will impose. The sentence which I will impose is in respect of only the offences that I convicted him of. 

18Mr Patrick fairly acknowledged that the offences were examples of crimes in the lower range of seriousness for this kind of offence committed in this way. Ms O'Reilly embraced that submission pointing out that there were no threats involved and that each of the incidents was relatively brief in time. All of the incidents occurred within a home to which Mr Taupe was entitled access and there was no attempt by him to isolate her or to take her away. 

19I accept that each of the offences was spontaneous and opportunistic. I also accept that there were no aggravating features within s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). I do not regard any delay between the commission of the offences and Mr Taupe ultimately coming forward or being interviewed by the police as relevant to the sentence. Mr Taupe is a man who comes before the Court without any prior criminal offences and I take that into account as well. 

20Ms O'Reilly tendered a report from a psychologist, Mr Alan Crockford. He has been seeing Mr Taupe as a patient since the middle of 2010. That is an unusual feature and one that is favourable to Mr Taupe, in my opinion. Mr Crockford lists a large number of occasions when he has consulted Mr Taupe who was obviously wanting to deal with the factors in his life which led him to committing these very serious offences. 

21Mr Crockford referred to Mr Taupe's background and personal history and concluded - 

""The main factors that triggered the aberrant and compulsive sexual behaviour was an extremely distressed marital relationship, the lack of emotional attachment with either of his parents as a child, and his unique history of only ever experiencing true intimacy in childhood with his female cousins when they played with him but also sexually molested him at 4 years of age and the intensely intimate sexual discussion and sexual experiences with a young adult female at 12 or 13 years of age."" 

I add that that female was herself some 19 years of age and it was Mr Taupe who was aged 12 or 13. Mr Crockford diagnosed a condition of depression and concluded that ""depression and Mr Taupe's personality vulnerabilities are both closely related to Mr Taupe's offending behaviour and are mental health problems that would be amenable to the treatment that would be provided in a sexual offenders program."" To Mr Taupe's credit, Mr Crockford expresses the belief that he ""has an excellent attitude to treatment. I am also of the view that Mr Taupe is extremely unlikely to reoffend."" 

22The report prompted submissions from both counsel. Mr Patrick drew my attention to a judgment of Simpson J on behalf of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Benitez v R [2006] NSWCCA 21; 160 A Crim R 166. Her Honour, in a judgment dealing with the relevance of the mental health condition of depression in sentencing, said at [41] that ""the influence of the depression must remain in perspective."" Her Honour referred to the judgment of the then Chief Judge at Common Law, Hunt J, in R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 where his Honour said - 

""But, if the offender acts with knowledge of what he is doing and with knowledge of the gravity of his actions, the moderation [in sentence] need not be great."" 

23Depression, according to Mr Crockford, was related to Mr Taupe's criminal behaviour and not necessarily the direct cause. But finding in Mr Taupe's favour that it was closely related I would, nevertheless, adopt what Simpson J said at [42] that Mr Taupe ""although acting out of depression, also acted with knowledge of what he was doing and of the gravity of his actions"".

24There is a question whether the report might provide a basis for a finding by me of remorse under s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the report can provide a basis for such a finding. 

25As Mr Patrick argued, the statute permits me to take into account remorse ""only if"" Mr Taupe (in this case) ""has provided evidence that he...has accepted responsibility for his...actions"". As Mr Patrick argued and I accept, Mr Taupe has always challenged the assertion by Abbie White that he digitally penetrated her. I do not find that he has accepted responsibility for his actions in doing that. Nevertheless, I accept Ms O'Reilly's submission that the report can be taken into account in Mr Taupe's favour for the subjective material which it contains. 

26I give it more weight than a report prepared after one or two consultations by a psychologist qualified for the purpose of the sentencing proceedings to give evidence. This is a report by a treating psychologist who has treated Mr Taupe as a patient for nearly three years. I accept the psychologist's conclusion that Mr Taupe has an excellent attitude to his treatment and is extremely unlikely to re-offend. I regard his prospects of rehabilitation as good and his likelihood of re-offending as very low. 

27Mr Taupe of course pleaded not guilty, as he was entitled to do. That has no unfavourable impact upon the sentence which I will impose but it does mean that he does not receive the benefit that a person who has pleaded guilty to crimes would receive as a discount in the sentence. 

28I have been referred to the statistics for these kinds of offences kept by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. As Mr Patrick acknowledges, the database was relatively small. I bear in mind that these are what the law regards as historical sexual assaults. The legislation which was relevant at the time that these assaults were committed has been repealed. I must sentence under the legislation as it was in place at the time and I must try to bear in mind the sentencing pattern that may have been applicable at the time. 

29Mr Patrick referred me to the relevant authorities. I should add that it is clear that Mr Taupe is generally remorseful and contrite for his behaviour but I cannot find, as I say on the balance of probabilities, remorse in the terms of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

30I have been helpfully referred to some cases where decisions were delivered by the Court of Criminal Appeal to do with sentences of the kind which I am about to impose. In particular I found helpful the decision of the Court in SDS v R [2009] NSWCCA 159 and some of the cases referred to by Ms O'Reilly in the printout from the Public Defenders' sentence database which became marked for identification 16. 

31Ms O'Reilly invited me to consider the possibility of a suspended sentence. When I pointed out at the beginning of this submission that the focus of the submission needed to be on the length of the sentence rather than whether or not I should suspend it, she acknowledged fairly - and it was in my opinion the only position to take - that there is no other appropriate sentence than custody so far as these offences were concerned. However she argued that the penalties, if they fell at 2 years or less, could be by way of suspended sentence. 

32She referred to what the High Court had said in Dinsdale [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 and argued that suspending a sentence is not without precedent and full-time custody for crimes such as these is not an absolute result. That is also demonstrated by the statistics. So far as the question of whether or not to suspend the sentence is concerned, that is a matter which I would turn to - if relevant - once I have fixed the sentence. 

33By reference to the cases where other penalties have been imposed for these kinds of offences, and taking into account what happened in this case and also the matters personal to Mr Taupe, I would regard an appropriate sentence for the first offence under s 66C(2), committed between 1 and 31 December 2000, as 2 years imprisonment. 

34I would regard an appropriate sentence for the second offence under the same section, committed between [withheld] 2001, as also 2 years imprisonment. 

35I would partially accumulate those two sentences by commencing the second sentence 3 months after the commencement of the first sentence. I would regard an appropriate sentence for the third offence against s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act, committed between 1 January and 3 May 2004, as 3 years imprisonment. Once again I would partially accumulate that on the second sentence by 3 months. 

36The overall sentence which I would therefore regard as appropriate would be 3½ years imprisonment. In a moment I will fix an aggregate sentence of that term. 

37Normally for a sentence of 3 ½ years imprisonment the non-parole period would be about 2 years and 8 months, something over 2 ½ years in prison. But I propose to reduce the non-parole period to one of 21 months, namely 1 year and 9 months. I regard there being special circumstances for making that adjustment to the normal ratio. Those special circumstances are based upon the report of the psychologist. It is clear to me that Mr Taupe has benefited greatly from his psychological treatment and his prospects of rehabilitation are very good. I think that it would be appropriate for him to spend a more extensive period of time in the community so that he can pursue his rehabilitation. Hence I have reduced the non-parole period. 

38I will fix an aggregate sentence of 3 ½ years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 21 months. That is fixed under s 53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

HIS HONOUR: Mr Taupe, I am going to sentence you now. If you would stand up, please. 

39I fix a non-parole period of 21 months to commence today, which is 5 April 2013. It will expire on 4 January 2015. The balance of the term is also 21 months, or 1 year and 9 months. It will commence on 5 January 2015 and expire on 4 October 2016. The overall sentence is 3 years and 6 months commencing today, 5 April 2013, and expiring on 4 October 2016. Have a seat, Mr Taupe. 

HIS HONOUR: First the mathematics, please. Three years and 6 months commencing today, expiring 4 October 2016, non-parole period after that 1 year 9 months commencing today, expiring 4 January 2015. Take your time. 
O'REILLY: Yes, we say that's correct. 
HIS HONOUR: Thanks, Ms O'Reilly. 
PATRICK: Yes, we agree, your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: Mr Patrick and Ms O'Reilly, are there any matters where I may have made an error in which could be corrected under s 43? I am not saying there are but anything - or any factual errors that I made that could be dealt with? Once again I am not saying there are, I am just checking. 
O'REILLY: No, your Honour. 
PATRICK: Nothing to raise, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Mr Taupe, I know you have got other things on your mind but I have to explain this to you. You have received a gaol sentence of 3 ½ years. That is one sentence although there are three offences. I have indicated that I have broken them up and told you what I would have imposed for each one and how I would have staggered them a bit and that the overall result would be 3 ½ years. Normally the non-parole period for 3 ½ year sentence would be more than 2 ½ years, should be some 31/32 months in gaol. I have reduced that to 21 months. 

So it is half in gaol, subject to what I say in a moment, half out of gaol. That is so that you can pursue your rehabilitation. You are obviously well on the track as far as that is concerned. 

You go into custody today and you are eligible for parole on 5 January 2015 - 5 January 2015 you are eligible for parole. Whether you get parole is not up to me, it is up to the Parole Authority. They assess your application and they make up their mind and if they release you then you stay still under sentence for the following 1 year and 9 months, you are still under sentence but you are in the community and if you breach your parole they bring you back. 

Ms O'Reilly or Mr Kernaghan: got your instructions, my associate will send to the prison authorities your report. They have indicated that they find those things very helpful in assessing your classification where you should go. Are these your friends and relatives here in court? 

OFFENDER: My family. 

HIS HONOUR: All right, your family. It is up to the Corrective Services officers, not me, but if they want to talk to you for a couple of minutes after I go off the bench that is all right with me. But they are in charge of you now, not me. Good luck.

		19 August 2014",2013-04-04 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761221,"R v Darabi, Mansoor & Razai [2013] NSWSC 387","Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The offenders Mehdi Darabi, Amir Morad Mansoor and Mehdi Agha Razai stand for sentence for having committed the offence of affray at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (""VIDC"") on 20 April 2011.

2Affray is an offence contrary to s 93C of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the maximum penalty that is prescribed for it is imprisonment for 10 years.

Facts

3The Crown tendered a Statement of Facts that incorporated reference to each of the offenders. Counsel for the offenders Mansoor and Razai took objection to certain paragraphs which refer to specific acts alleged to have been committed by their clients. I have considered those objections but have concluded that it is not necessary to deal with them. As discussed in the course of the sentence hearing, I do not believe it is necessary in assessing the criminality of each man to precisely identify each particular act they performed over the hours in which the offences were committed. 

4The VIDC is an approved place under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) for the detention of persons not authorised to enter or remain in Australia. Staffing at the VIDC was contracted by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (""DIAC"") to a company known as Serco. As at 20 April 2011, the offenders were detained at the VIDC pursuant to the Migration Act, having arrived in Australia early in 2010. 

5There are three compounds within the VIDC and when the offenders were sent there on 17 July 2010 they were housed within the Fowler Compound. There were four residential buildings within Fowler, named the Macquarie Building, the Nepean Building, the Clarence Building and the Darling Building. There were sundry other buildings, such as an office, mess, recreation room, gym and a laundry. There were 158 detainees within Fowler on 20 April 2011.

6Applications by each offender for a visa to enter Australia had been refused but as at 20 April 2011 their immigration status had not been finalised.

7On 20 April 2011, the offenders Darabi and Mansoor were seen to be on the roof of the Macquarie Building from about 7.15am. Thereafter they were seen to engage in various activities and the statement of facts refers to the following:



Threatening to throw roof tiles at staff. One of them threatening a Serco officer by saying, ""Get that fucking camera away from me or this tile is going over your head"" . Mansoor was seen holding a tile. 

When a Serco officer of Fijian Indian descent was present, one of them said, ""You'd better move that black cunt, get him away from here"" . 

Staff were continually abused. 

Mansoor was seen holding a tile in both hands above his head and was making a throwing action. Throughout the day Darabi and Mansoor were seen to throw roof tiles into the compound, at telephone booths, the soccer field and at the interview rooms, damaging windows and walls of the latter. Serco staff members were located in the general area at the time. I take this to be a general proposition without any precise identification of the acts of each of the two men. 

A negotiator asked them to move away from the edge of the roof and tried to engage with them but they said that they did not want to talk. 

At about 10.20am they became abusive towards a female interpreter and shouted at her. Mansoor said to the negotiator as he was holding a roof tile, ""Get her out of here ... or I'm going to throw this"" . At about 11.38am they were informed that three Imams were due to visit the compound that night. Mansoor replied, ""Don't bring the Imam up here. We'll throw tiles at him"" . At around midday they were again seen to pull tiles from the roof and throw them in the direction of the soccer field and also the mess hall. Walls and the door of the latter were damaged. At various times there was engagement in conversation between detainees on the ground and the pair on the roof. Some of the detainees on the ground were throwing items up to the roof. 

8At about 2.00pm, the activities officer tried to commence a game of soccer. Darabi and Mansoor yelled, ""don't shoot"" and ""no football"" while throwing tiles on to the soccer field. Others on the ground were also yelling ""no football"". Darabi said, ""Stop playing the soccer game as we're making a point by being on the roof"". 

9Staff had formed a cordon around the Macquarie Building in order to prevent other detainees getting onto the roof. This meant that they were between those on the roof and the detainees playing soccer and were therefore in the line of fire of the roof tiles being thrown.

10A detainee on the ground, Mahmood Dadash, approached the activities officer and told him not to play soccer and to ""fuck off, fuck off"". When the activities officer moved the game further away from the Macquarie Building, Dadash again approached and said, ""I told you to fuck off, don't play here"". Another detainee, Ali Abdollahi, ran over to the officer, accompanied by about 40 other detainees, swinging his hand with a closed fist and saying ""fuck off, fuck off"". One of the detainees grabbed the soccer ball and kicked it over the fence, out of the compound. 

11Shortly before 3.00pm, a staff member attempted to take refreshments to staff in the vicinity of the Macquarie Building. Darabi abused him and Mansoor held a tile as if he was going to throw it and said, ""fuck off ... we'll kill you"" and ""no, no, not through that gate"". The staff member retreated. Mansoor threw the tile near some telephone booths and it smashed on an area of concrete. The Crown accepts that the staff member was unaware of the throwing of this tile (1.3.13 at T5.23).

12At about the same time, Mansoor called out to staff, ""we're up here for a reason, don't drink in front of us, we are up here for a reason. How dare you eat or drink in front of us. If you drink or eat in front of us, we're going to throw tiles at you"". Staff members near the Macquarie Building were ordered to move back.

13Detainees on the ground threw bedding and water bottles up to the roof. Staff members were further instructed to move back. This activity continued and at about 6.00pm Mansoor said to staff, ""Don't stop them otherwise you'll get a tile thrown at your head"". 

14More detainees attempted to join Darabi and Mansoor on the roof after 7.00pm. There was a large group on the ground, estimated to be between 40 and 60, aggressively yelling at Serco staff and management. There was a rush towards the Macquarie Building and some made their way to the roof, including Mohammed Amiri and the offender Razai. At around 7.30pm, detainees were yelling, ""we want freedom"". This shouting continued. Some of those on the roof were seen to be making ropes out of bed sheets to assist others to climb onto the roof. 

15At about 8.00pm, the men on the roof, including the three present offenders (although Mansoor denies involvement in this) were seen throwing tiles at staff. There was encouragement to those on the ground to continue the disturbance and to come up to the roof. Tiles were thrown by Amiri at staff members who were trying to prevent detainees getting to the roof. One tile landed no more than a metre from one staff member who, it is said, had concerns for the safety of her staff and other clients.

16One officer estimated that at about 8.20pm there were 80-90 detainees around the Macquarie Building. Thereafter the situation deteriorated with more abuse, tile throwing and other threatening behaviour towards staff. I will only refer to that which concerns the present three offenders. Television camera footage shows Mansoor and Razai throwing tiles and Darabi carrying a tile on the roof around 11.00pm. Mansoor denies this; the suggestion being that he was in fact imploring detainees to stop throwing tiles. There is some evidence that he said to others at one point, ""stop throwing stones"", but the evidence is insufficient to make any definitive finding about what he was doing. It is regrettable that he did not give evidence himself.

17By about 11.15pm, the situation in the Fowler compound was one of absolute mayhem. The danger to the physical safety of staff was so extreme that a decision was taken to evacuate. Detainees were charging at them as they fled. By this stage there was a volley of roof tiles being thrown from the roof of the Macquarie Building, a fire on the soccer field had been lit using the contents of garbage bins and a picnic table, fire extinguishers were being emptied of their contents and thrown at staff, and soccer goals were dismantled and parts thrown at staff. Shortly after staff evacuated, the office building was ablaze and fires were set in other buildings as well.

18There is no reference in the statement of facts to the identity of those who were responsible for the subsequent demolition by fire and otherwise of various buildings within the Fowler compound and elsewhere within the VIDC and so it is unnecessary to refer to the detail. However, two matters should be mentioned; the first is that it is not alleged that any of the present offenders were responsible; the second is that the damage to the VIDC was extreme, with the estimated total cost of the damage being in the order of $9 million.

19Each of the offenders were arrested and charged on 12 January 2012. They were held in Corrective Services custody, having been denied bail, until 1 February 2012 (Razai), 9 March 2012 (Mansoor) and 5 April 2012 (Darabi).

Matters personal to the offender Razai

20The material I have as to matters personal to the offender Razai are a Pre-Sentence Report, a report of Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, a psychological assessment report by Ms Larisa Zilenkov, psychologist, an email sent by Mr Razai to Dr Furst on 7 February 2013, a letter addressed to me by Mr Razai dated 1 March 2013, and a testimonial by a Ms Renee Chan dated 1 March 2013. There are also sundry other documents that do not warrant mention at this point. The offender gave oral evidence in the sentence proceedings.

21Mr Razai is a 24 year old man who was born in Afghanistan. He and his family fled to Pakistan when he was about 7 years old. He belonged to the Hazari people who were subjected to persecution by the Taliban. Because he was a refugee in Pakistan he was not entitled to state education and was home schooled. His father died when he was about 20 or 21 years old. He has two older sisters and two brothers. His older brother died in 2009 and his younger brother died in 2010. He had worked as a computer operator for about 3 years in Pakistan for a building company.

22Mr Razai says that he was present in a mosque in Quetta City, Pakistan, in July 2003 when four men entered and discharged automatic firearms and hand grenades. He lay on the floor, fearing that he would be killed. In March 2004 he was at a religious mourning ceremony when some men ambushed the gathering and shot into the crowd, used hand grenades and set off a bomb. He says he witnessed the killing of some of his friends.

23He says that he experienced ongoing symptoms of anxiety, nightmares, flashbacks and depression in relation to these events. Dr Furst says ""it would appear that he has become more depressed since arriving in Australia, to the point that 'nothing matters to him anymore'"". 

24Mr Razai came to Australia by boat from Indonesia to Christmas Island on 4 February 2010. It was a journey over about 15 days in terrible weather and he feared that he would drown. He spent several months on Christmas Island in crowded conditions. He was distressed by other detainees hurting themselves and attempted hangings. His younger brother died during this time and he was badly affected. He felt suicidal and self-harmed by cutting himself. He had also self-harmed a number of times back in Pakistan.

25He told Dr Furst that he was transferred to the VIDC in September 2010 (the Crown says it was July 2010 but nothing turns on that). He described the conditions there as ""poor"" and he ""felt like he was in gaol"". His application for a Protection Visa had been first rejected in August 2010. He suffered a further rejection in March 2011 and claimed that he thought ""he may die in Villawood"". 

26Mr Razai said that he was distressed by an Iraqi detainee, who had been a very good friend, hanging himself. He had opened a shower door and found him deceased. This made it hard for him to sleep and eat and he became more depressed. These feelings worsened when a Fijian detainee who was also a friend jumped from the roof of the detention centre and died. I have no doubt that these two suicides occurred because there has been evidence about them in the trial over which I am presently presiding.

27An appeal in relation to his application for a visa was refused in August 2011 and another application was rejected in February 2012. He is now appealing to the High Court of Australia. 

28Mr Razai has been treated with a number of medications and is presently taking a combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs. He told Dr Furst, ""I don't feel anything anymore. I feel dizzy and numb because of the medications"". 

29In his account of his involvement in the offence, Mr Razai told Dr Furst that he was hoping to get in touch with the media or United Nations ""to tell them how tough it was for us. I had no intention to damage the place or set fire to the place"". He acknowledged frustration in relation to one of his applications for a visa having been denied the previous month. 

30He acknowledged that he threw a few roof tiles and said ""I couldn't control myself. They weren't aimed towards anyone. They were aimed at the ground. I was sitting quietly until the end. There was only about 20 seconds of tile throwing. The rest of the time I was peaceful."" He did not know why he threw tiles. He told the author of the Pre-Sentence Report that ""in fear and confusion I threw some tiles and for that I am very sorry"".

31Dr Furst noted that there was no history of alcohol or drug misuse or any significant medical history. 

32Mr Razai told Dr Furst that he was fearful of being sent back to Pakistan. He thought he would be ""identified"" and said, ""they will shoot me"". 

33Dr Furst made the diagnoses of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder. He set out the features of such disorders in some detail in his report but I do not believe it is necessary to recount them now.

34On the questions of remorse and rehabilitation, Dr Furst thought he was ""remorseful about his actions and is motivated to accept further psychiatric and psychological treatment"" and said ""his actions in April 2011 appear to have been out of character. He presents as a young man with good prospects of future rehabilitation."" The Pre-Sentence Report includes that ""the offender expressed regret for his participation in the offence"". 

35There is with the report of Dr Furst and in some of the sundry other material tendered on Mr Razai's behalf references to something that has been called ""Prolonged Asylum Seekers Syndrome"". I find it unnecessary to determine whether the existence of such a syndrome should be accepted. Despite some scepticism of the Crown, I am prepared to accept the diagnoses made by Dr Furst that I have just referred to. The precise cause and contributing features relating to the offender suffering from such disorders is not of primary significance. It is the fact that he suffers from those disorders itself that is significant. Determining whether those disorders are attributable to his experiences prior to coming to this country, after coming to this country, or a combination of the two, would be an unproductive and irrelevant exercise.

36Dr Furst includes in a latter passage in his report:

In my opinion, his participation in the so called Villawood Riots was probably driven by his high levels of emotional distress as a manifestation of his PTSD and depression, the frustration he was experiencing [in] the application process for a protection visa, and his sense of hopelessness and demoralisation at the time. He was also motivated by an apparent wish to air his grievances to the media and United Nations.

37The recommendations of Dr Furst as to future treatment of Mr Razai, whether in custody or in the community, the latter including being in immigration detention, include various psychiatric and psychological interventions as well as engagement in educational, vocational and social activities. He also offered the opinion that further detention of Mr Razai in a custodial environment would likely weigh more heavily upon Mr Razai than for the average prison inmate.

38Ms Zilenkov's report was included in the documentation reviewed by Dr Furst and it adds nothing of significance to what appears in his report. Similarly, the Pre-Sentence Report adds nothing of significance.

39The offender's letter includes an expression of remorse but it includes a claim that ""if I had known how things could escalate that day I would never have climbed up. I had imagined a peaceful action"". His oral evidence involved an element of downplaying his role, a matter that his counsel, Mr Webb, accepted it was open to me to find. I do, however, accept that he is likely genuine in the apology he expressed in the letter for the distress the disturbance caused and the damage to property that occurred.

40Mr Razai also set out in his letter a variety of ways in which he has provided help to others within the VIDC. This supports a finding as to his character and his rehabilitation prospects. Reference is also made to aspects of his experience in Pakistan; matters I have mentioned above in the context of my review of Dr Furst's report. 

41The letter from Ms Chan also refers to the ways in which Mr Razai has been a co-operative and helpful detainee at the VIDC. 

Custodial and immigration history of the offender Razai

42According to information derived from the records of DIAC, Mr Razai arrived on Christmas Island as an ""irregular maritime arrival"" on 11 February 2010. He was found not to be a refugee by a Refugee Status Assessment on 18 August 2011. On 24 February 2011, he was found not to be owed protection by an Independent Merits Review. On 30 March 2011, he lodged an application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court.

43That was his immigration status at the time of the offence.

44The next event to occur was on 27 October 2011 when the Federal Magistrates Court gave judgment dismissing his application. He lodged a notice of appeal to the Federal Court of Australia three weeks later.

45On 12 January 2012, Mr Razai was arrested and charged with riot and affray and was refused bail. Bail was granted on 1 February 2012 and he was returned from Corrective Services custody to the VIDC.

46On 20 April 2012, the Federal Court dismissed the appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court: Razai v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2012] FCA 394. 

47On 4 January 2012, Mr Razai was notified of a negative International Treaties Obligations Assessment. I understand this to mean that whilst he had so far been unsuccessful in establishing that he was refugee entitled to protection in this country and thus liable to deportation, another assessment is carried out to see whether for some other reason he should not be deported (e.g. due to a risk of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, punishment or violation of the right to life, or for other exceptional circumstances).

48On 30 July 2012, Mr Razai filed an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia. I am told that a hearing date has yet to be allocated. Mr Razai has not made any formal request to be removed from Australia.

Consideration of Community Detention

49On 12 August 2011, Mr Razai's case was referred for consideration of community detention but on 19 January 2012 his case was assessed as not meeting the guidelines for referral to the Minister for consideration. On 8 February 2012, he was notified that, in any event, the Minister had determined not to approve community detention for any detainees who were facing criminal charges. Notwithstanding that, on 20 March 2012 Mr Razai's case was again referred for consideration of community detention but, seemingly inevitably, on 20 April 2012 he was assessed as not meeting the guidelines for referral to the Minister because he was still facing criminal charges.

Findings in relation to the offender Razai

50I am satisfied that no sentence other than one of full-time imprisonment is appropriate to reflect the objective gravity of the offence. I will say something more about that later. 

51I am satisfied that Mr Razai's involvement in the offence was attributable partly to his anger and frustration concerning the circumstances of his detention, including how long he had been held, and partly to his Post Traumatic Stress and Major Depressive Disorders that have been diagnosed by Dr Furst. A number of matters flow from that finding. Insofar as the psychiatric conditions contributed to the offending behaviour there is a reduction in the level of his moral culpability as well as a reduction in the need for a sentence to serve to denounce his conduct. I intend to place slightly less emphasis on general deterrence in the assessment of sentence. I also accept that a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily upon Mr Razai than for an inmate not suffering from such disorders.

52Mr Razai is a man of otherwise good character; he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. Whilst he was not entirely convincing, I am prepared to accept on balance that he is remorseful. 

53There will be a reduction of sentence in the order of about 12.5 per cent to reflect the utilitarian benefit flowing from the plea of guilty that was entered about a month and a half before the trial date.

54I am also satisfied that there are special circumstances warranting the setting of a non-parole period that is less than the usual three quarters of the total term. These circumstances derive from the combination of a number of aspects of Mr Razai's subjective case but most particularly because he is a person who has spent a considerable period in immigration detention now being sentenced to a term of imprisonment and because of the need for him to receive treatment for his mental health issues, something that will be more amenable to a favourable outcome with treatment in the community rather than the custodial environment.

Matters personal to the offender Darabi

55The material I have as to matters personal to the offender Darabi are a Pre-Sentence Report, a report of Dr Richard Furst, a psychological assessment report by Ms Zilenkov, psychologist, and some documents in relation to ""Prolonged Asylum Seeker Syndrome"".

56Mr Darabi gave evidence which included that what he had told the authors of reports was truthful. He was not cross-examined about that.

57Mr Darabi is a 25 year old Kurdish man who grew up in Illam, a province in the western region of Iran near the Iran-Iraq border, his family having fled from Iraq. His father died when he was a toddler and he grew up with his mother and sister. He was unable to attend school and was educated at home. He worked on farms as a child, growing wheat and herding sheep. He also did some labouring work.

58The Iran-Iraq war had ended by the time of his childhood but he told Dr Furst that he saw people returning to his village who had been maimed and had other war-related disabilities.

59Mr Darabi was unable to obtain an identification card because of his family origins and so he was not a citizen of his country of birth. Dr Furst described him as ""stateless"". (The document used by Serco to keep track of detainees lists his nationality as ""Iranian"", but there is no evidence before me as to how that information was generated.) This resulted in him and his family not having access to government services, such as education and health care. He claimed to have been harassed and, on one occasion, assaulted by the Basij, a domestic paramilitary security force who, Mr Darabi has claimed, regard Kurdish people as the enemy. That was what he told Ms Zilenkov. He told Dr Furst that he ""denied being directly threatened by security forces in Iran"". 

60Mr Darabi left Iran and came to Australia, via a boat from Indonesia, on 29 January 2010. He described the sea voyage as traumatising. He told Dr Furst that he came to Australia as ""he had no hope in his home country, coming to Australia because he wanted to study, get married, have children and build a future for himself"". He added, ""I had heaps of hope then. I have no hope now"". Why he chose to come to Australia without prior approval was not explained.

61His account to Dr Furst included that the conditions on Christmas Island, where he spent about six months, were difficult, it being overcrowded and where detainees were self-harming and suiciding. 

62He was transferred to Villawood in mid-2010. He claimed that conditions remained poor and he lost hope in the immigration and visa application process. He heard about people committing suicide and witnessed two people killing themselves, including his neighbour and friend, an Iraqi detainee, who killed himself in a bathroom. His best friend tried to commit suicide and he was aware of a Fijian detainee who jumped from a roof and died. In this respect, the history parallels that of Mr Razai.

63Mr Darabi told Dr Furst that he found the trauma of these events very difficult to come to terms with. He became increasingly depressed and demoralised and entertained thoughts of suicide himself. 

64Dr Furst's report then refers to Mr Darabi's account of the offence. It included that his application for a visa had been rejected on three occasions. In his evidence before me he said he ""had been rejected three or four times"" (15.3.13 at T38.12). This is not quite accurate; it was, in fact, twice. The account to Dr Furst also included that ""he had been in detention for about two years at the time"". When speaking about the offence to the author of the Pre-Sentence Report he said ""I was so sick and tired of being in the centre for three years"" (emphasis added). Later in that report it is said that he attributed his participation in the offences to having been held in detention for approximately two years. The truth is he had been in detention since arriving in Australia for 15 months. 

65He said that he was ""under a lot of pressure"" and ""went to the roof to talk"", meaning speak to the DIAC and human rights advocates. He ""wanted to tell them I was here. I wanted to be listened to"". 

66He told Dr Furst that he felt ashamed of his actions and ""expressed remorse"". ""It was a shameful thing. Not a good thing. A bad start"". Exactly what he said when he ""expressed remorse"" is not further disclosed. When cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor he acknowledged that protesting in such a violent way was unacceptable; that the actions of himself and the other detainees caused a lot of distress to a lot of people; and that throwing large and heavy tiles off the roof would cause people to fear for their safety. He added, ""I accept and I regret what I did and I'm very sorry"" (15.3.13 at T39).

67His credibility suffered, however, when he denied seeing one of the main perpetrators of violence from the roof, Majid Parhizkar, throwing a large number of tiles into the centre of the compound. The video footage shows that anyone in the vicinity, as Mr Darabi was, could not have failed to have noticed. He also claimed, incredibly, not to have seen a raging fire on the soccer field or detainees running around spraying fire extinguishers into the air. He claimed not to remember that there were many more Serco staff in the compound than normal; that there was a lot of noise and yelling by detainees; and that detainees were chanting ""freedom"" (15.3.13 at T40).

68Mr Darabi has received treatment for depression and anxiety, seeing a psychologist once or twice a week and having been prescribed sleeping medication for about seven or eight months last year.

69Dr Furst recorded that there was no history of drug or alcohol abuse, no significant medical history, and no family history of mental illness.

70Contact with his family has been confined to about once every six months. His mother is said to be old, sick and confined to bed and this makes Mr Darabi feel guilty about his inability to help her and his sister. 

71Dr Furst made the psychiatric diagnosis that Mr Darabi was suffering from Major Depressive Disorder. He remarked that Mr Darabi's ""depression and sense of demoralisation appears to have been caused by his prolonged detention after arriving in Australia by boat on 29/01/10, over three years ago, and the lack of any pathway towards a protection visa or back to his homeland, as he is essentially stateless"". 

72It was Dr Furst's opinion that Mr Darabi's participation in the disturbance at the VIDC on 20 April 2011 was ""probably driven by his high levels of emotional distress, depression, and the frustration he was experiencing at the time, and his sense of hopelessness and demoralisation. He was also motivated by an apparent wish to tell the authorities what was happening to him and voice his plight. His actions also appear to be a matter where Mr Darabi acted out of character in the exceptional circumstances that he found himself in.""

73Dr Furst set out a variety of recommended treatments for Mr Darabi, both in the community and in a custodial environment. Generally they involve engagement with psychiatric and psychological counselling as well as with vocational, educational or social activities. Antidepressant medication is also indicated as an option.

74Depression, social isolation, poor English skills and the trauma of being detained since arriving in Australia three years ago are the bases of Dr Furst's opinion that ""a custodial sentence is likely to weigh more heavily on Mr Darabi than the average inmate"". 

Custodial and immigration history of the offender Darabi

75Mr Darabi arrived at Christmas Island on 31 January 2010. On 13 May 2010, he was found not to be a refugee by a DIAC Refugee Status Assessment. This finding was confirmed upon an Independent Merits Review on 13 January 2011 and on 10 February 2011 he lodged an application for judicial review.

76That judicial review application was pending at the time of the offence.

77On 25 May 2011, the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia dismissed the application: Darabi v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2011] FMCA 371.

78On 17 July 2012, a Criminal Justice Stay visa was refused. The following day, advice was received from the Protection Support Section that Mr Darabi had received a positive Post Review Protection Check assessment. I understand that this leads to the possibility of the Minister granting a visa.

79Mr Darabi has not made any formal request to be removed from Australia.

Consideration of community detention

80On 26 September 2011, Mr Darabi was found to meet the guidelines for referral to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship for consideration of community detention. However, on 3 February 2012 he was no longer considered for such detention due to the fact he had been placed in the custody of Corrective Services NSW following being charged and refused bail. I can only assume that the question of community detention was not agitated after he was released on bail because a ministerial guideline meant that it would be futile to do so.

Findings in relation to the offender Darabi

81I am satisfied in respect of Mr Darabi, and it was so conceded, that no sentence other than one of full-time imprisonment is appropriate to reflect the objective gravity of the offence.

82I have some misgivings about Mr Darabi's credibility and that raises a question as to whether I should accept what he said in evidence as well as what he told the authors of the reports that are before me. On balance, however, I am prepared to accept the diagnosis by Dr Furst that Mr Darabi was suffering from Major Depressive Disorder. I do so because it is entirely consistent with the history of Mr Darabi's life before coming to Australia and his experiences since arriving here. Further, whilst I am somewhat sceptical about his account of what motivated his offending behaviour, I do accept that anger and frustration about the circumstances and length of his detention (putting aside whether it was justified), together with his depression, were significant causative factors. 

83That conclusion leads me to find that there is some, but not great, reduction in his moral culpability for the offence and the need for denunciation of his conduct. A little less weight should be assigned to the need for general deterrence. I also accept that a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily upon Mr Darabi than it would for the average prison inmate.

84The lack of criminal antecedents means that Mr Darabi is entitled to a finding of good character and would justify findings that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. 

85I am not satisfied that he is genuinely remorseful because he has not been entirely frank in his evidence to me and in the histories given to the report authors.

86There will be a reduction of sentence in the order of about 12.5 per cent to reflect the utilitarian benefit flowing from the plea of guilty that was entered late last year. 

87I am satisfied that there are special circumstances warranting the setting of a non-parole period that is less than the usual three-quarters of the total term. In this respect I have had regard to his subjective case generally, but in particular to the fact Mr Darabi has spent a significant period in immigration detention and is now being sentenced to a term of imprisonment. There is also the better prospect of him receiving more favourable treatment for his mental health issues in the community than in the custodial environment.

Personal circumstances of the offender Mansoor

88The material relating to the personal circumstances of the offender Mansoor comprises a report by Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, and sundry documents including a Refugee Status Assessment (""RSA"") report within a folder of material (Exhibit 1). Mr Mansoor did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings.

89Mr Mansoor was born in 1988 and is an only child. His father died when he was 11 years of age and he was forced to leave school and work as a labourer and in a grocery shop to support his mother. He has never married and has no children.

90The RSA report of May 2010 records him as claiming to be ""stateless"". (The Serco roll lists his nationality as Iraqi.) His parents were born in Iraq but were expelled to Iran in 1980 because of their ethnicity, Faili Kurdish, and because they did not have any identity documents. His father was told that the family should return to Iraq because they did not belong in Iran. However, the family remained in Iran but did take steps to obtain identity documents for fear of deportation.

91Mr Mansoor gave as his reason for leaving Iran that he was an undocumented Faili Kurd living illegally in Iran. He claimed to have been harassed and mistreated by the Basij. The worst example cited in the RSA report was when in December 2009 he was approached by Basij officers and asked for his identity document. When he failed to comply with the request, he was taken to a mosque where he was detained for some hours and beaten. This is said to have been the impetus for him to leave Iran. He left on a flight to Malaysia on 14 January 2010 and ultimately arrived at Christmas Island on 31 January 2010. He was transferred to Villawood on 17 July 2010. 

92The RSA resulted in a finding that Mr Mansoor's claimed fears of persecution by reasons of race or religion were not well founded. There was no information that would suggest that Faili Kurds were subject to discrimination or persecution for reasons of their ethno-religious identity. It was accepted that he had been detained and punished by the Basij because he was unable to show an identity card. But that was pursuant to the law applying to all people in Iran and had nothing to do with Mr Mansoor being a Faili Kurd.

93In a letter of 1 March 2013, Mr Mansoor said that he came to Australia ""in hope of a better and brighter future, safe future"". He expressed his deep regret about being involved in the events of 20 April 2011 and was ""truly sorry if I offended or scared anyone"". He explained that he had no intention to offend or hurt anyone; he simply wanted his voice to be heard. He felt forgotten, had faced ""rejection after rejection of my case"", and ""was surrounded by negativity and found it very difficult to cope"". He described to Dr Nielssen how he felt frustrated and angered by his long detention.

94The history provided to Dr Nielssen also included that the government in Iran was hostile to people living in Kurdish dominated areas, prevented them from living in peace and failed to provide basic services such as health care and education to allow them to live comfortably. He was afraid of the government and came to Australia to ""escape from persecution"". The material in the RSA report contradicts such claims. I do not know which is correct.

95A mental health nurse assessed Mr Mansoor on 11 February 2011. The ""presenting problems"" were that he was ""convinced he has cancer and wants to die in Iran"" and ""expresses feelings of hopelessness and helplessness regarding his immigration pathway"". While noting that he presented as angry, upset and with depressed mood, under the heading ""Risk Assessment"" (related medical notes indicate that this related to any risk or harm to himself or others) she wrote ""Low at present"". 

96In late March 2011, some concern was expressed by a Mental Health Team Leader and noted by a person in the Detention Health Operations Section of DIAC about the possibility of Mr Mansoor experiencing some mental health issues. He had received a negative Independent Merits Review following the RSA, and he was refusing to engage with the mental health team.

97An external psychologist alerted Serco staff on 23 May 2011 to a concern that Mr Mansoor was at ""high risk of suicide"". According to Dr Nielssen, Mr Mansoor ""reported some thoughts of committing suicide and said that he seriously contemplated ending his life on one occasion, soon after he came down from the roof"". 

98Dr Nielssen saw Mr Mansoor in January 2013. He made a diagnosis of Adjustment disorder with depressed mood, in partial remission. It was his opinion that as at 20 April 2011, the symptoms were ""severe and suggested that he was at high risk of committing suicide"". He noted that he had been advised to consider treatment with medication but had declined. The rider to the diagnosis, ""in partial remission"", was on the basis that Mr Mansoor's mood had improved, he was animated in his manner in the interview, looked physically fit and did not appear especially depressed. 

99Dr Nielssen concluded his report with the following expression of opinion about Mr Mansoor's mental state at the time of the offence:

From the information available to me, it seems likely that Mr Mansoor was in an acutely distressed state in the period leading up to the offences and was contemplating suicide at that time. ... [H]is perception of the events and his ability to consider the likely consequences of his actions is likely to have been severely affected by his own lack of concern regarding his own safety and his readiness to commit suicide.

Custodial and immigration history

100Mr Mansoor arrived on Christmas Island on 31 January 2010. On 10 May 2010, it was determined that he was not a refugee. An Independent Merits Review concluded on 14 February 2011, that he was not a refugee. On 3 March 2011, he lodged an application for judicial review with the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia.

101It was while the latter application was pending that the offence occurred.

102The application for judicial review was heard on 6 July 2011 and judgment was given on 22 July 2011: SZPZI v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2011] FMCA 530. It was found that the independent merits reviewer had made an error of law. The matter was then referred to the Independent Protection Assessment Office for a new assessment. 

103On 1 March 2012, the fresh assessment again resulted in a finding that Mr Mansoor was not a refugee. Again, an application for judicial review was made to the Federal Magistrates Court. That application was dismissed on 4 December 2012: SZRLQ v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2012] FMCA 1159. An appeal against the dismissal was lodged with the Federal Court of Australia and was heard on 14 March 2013. Judgment has been reserved.

Consideration of community detention

104On 3 August 2011, while Mr Mansoor's case was awaiting fresh consideration by the Independent Protection Assessment Office, his case was also referred for consideration of community detention. On 30 November 2011, he was assessed as meeting the guidelines for referral to the Minister and a submission to the Minister was drafted. However, it was determined that the Minister would not approve community detention for detainees who were facing criminal charges. 

105Another request for community detention was received by DIAC from Mr Mansoor's partner on 12 June 2012. I interpolate that this is the only mention in any of the material to him having a ""partner"". The request was not referred for ministerial consideration because of the pending criminal charges. 

106Lastly, it is said that as at 13 March 2013, ""a community detention referral is currently in progress but has not yet been sent for assessment against the guidelines"".

107So, Mr Mansoor has not been considered by the Minister for community detention.

108He has not made any formal request to be removed from Australia.

Findings in relation to the offender Mansoor

109As with the other offenders, I am satisfied that no sentence other than one of full-time imprisonment is appropriate to reflect the objective gravity of the offence.

110I am satisfied that Mr Mansoor's involvement in the offence was attributable, in part, to his mental state. There is no reason not to accept the assessment by Dr Nielssen that I have quoted earlier. As a result, there is a lesser degree of moral culpability for the offence than would otherwise be the case and there is less need for a sentence to denounce his conduct. There should also be less emphasis in the sentence on the need for general deterrence. I also accept that a custodial sentence will weigh more heavily upon Mr Mansoor. Dr Nielssen considers that his mental health has significantly improved from what it had been, but he is a man who has been held in a distressing state of uncertainty in immigration detention for over three years and will have significant difficulties in then adjusting to a different and more onerous custodial environment.

111I accept that Mr Mansoor is a person of otherwise good character, there being no record of previous convictions. With the improvement in his mental state it would seem that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend.

112Mr Mansoor did not give evidence which makes it somewhat difficult to assess the genuineness of the expression of remorse in his letter. He bears the onus of proof and it only has to be on the balance of probabilities. In the light of all of the material before me about Mr Mansoor I am left with the impression that he probably is genuinely remorseful.

113There will be a reduction of sentence on account of the utilitarian benefit derived from his plea of guilty but it will be in the order of 5 per cent because of the late stage at which it was entered. 

114There are special circumstances warranting a lesser non-parole component of the sentence. Mr Mansoor will need a longer period of parole supervision to assist his adjustment into the community after release (even if it is back into immigration detention), particularly given that he will have been held in one form of custody or another for a relatively lengthy period.

Matters relevant to each offender

115I observed when sentencing Mahmood Dadash that an affray can occur in infinitely varied circumstances, but that it was clear that this one was particularly nasty. I also said that a matter relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of the offence was that many people would have been terrified by what occurred and their safety was put at risk. I am fortified in those views by what I have heard in the course of the trial over which I am presently presiding. A number of the Serco officers, who were public officials simply trying to do their job, have been significantly affected and that is not surprising. As the events in the compound descended into mayhem they were cowering behind an office wall trying to avoid the torrent of tiles being hurled from the roof, while others on the ground were running rampant with fire extinguishers and setting fire to bedding, tables, chairs and other items in the middle of the soccer field. Ultimately the detainees succeeded in forcing the staff to evacuate just as the office building was torched. 

116Affray is an offence that can be committed by one person but in this case there were a significant number who joined in the protest that had been commenced by Mansoor and Darabi, many of whom were actively involved in the use of violence. Others not using violence supported those who did by shouting and yelling things such as ""fuck Australia"", ""fuck immigration"" and ""fuck Serco"" and chanting over and over, ""freedom"". It is impossible to ignore the context when assessing the individual culpability of the present three offenders. 

117In making this last finding, I am mindful that the offenders are being sentenced for offences of affray, not of riot. A person convicted of riot bears some vicarious responsibility for the collective damage caused by the conflagration, regardless of his or her level of personal involvement beyond satisfying the elements of the offence. Participation in an offence of affray, even if committed in the circumstances of a large-scale disturbance, does not necessarily allow a similar inference, partly because s 93C does not require proof of, or a plea to, common purpose. This distinction was discussed by R S Hulme J (Spigelman CJ and Smart AJ agreeing) in R v Huynh [2000] NSWCCA 18 at [27]-[29], distinguishing McCormack, Merlo, Mulholland & Nance v R [1981] VR 104; (1980) 2 A Crim R 405 at 108; 409. Nevertheless, the facts in this case establish that the context of the disturbance was inextricable from the offending conduct. It has not been contended otherwise.

118I have said that no sentence other than one of full-time imprisonment is appropriate to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence. That remains the case notwithstanding findings I have made about there being a reduced moral culpability and about other matters arising from the influence of the offenders' mental condition upon their offending behaviour. Punishment, deterrence, denunciation and making the offenders accountable for their actions remain factors to be taken into account, albeit with somewhat less influence in the assessment of the sentences for these men.

119A matter that I noted in the sentencing of Mr Dadash was the theoretical possibility that an offence of affray may be dealt with summarily in the Local Court where the most that can be imposed is a sentence of imprisonment of 2 years. That does not mean that this Court is limited to such a sentencing range but it is a matter of some weight. Dadash was in the same position as these offenders in that the Crown accepted a plea of guilty in lieu of the more serious charge of riot.

Sentencing of Mahmood Dadash

120Mahmood Dadash pleaded guilty on 23 November 2012 to an offence of affray which the Crown accepted in lieu of a charge of riot. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 1 year 9 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 4 months. Without his plea of guilty it would have been a sentence of 2 years. See R v Dadash [2012] NSWSC 1511.

121Mr Dadash was involved in the events of 20 April 2011 in the Fowler Compound in a number of ways. He abused and swore at the activities officer who was trying to start a game of soccer in the early afternoon. During the evening he was one of a number of detainees who sprayed fire extinguishers at members of staff and who took garbage bins onto the soccer field where their contents were emptied and set on fire. 

122Mr Dadash was held in corrective services custody for about a year until he was granted bail and returned to immigration detention. He was 28 years old and had no previous convictions. There was evidence of prior good character. I did not accept that he was genuinely remorseful. 

123There were signs of post-traumatic stress disorder but no psychiatric diagnosis of such. I did not accept that this was causally related to his offending behaviour. I did accept that his involvement in the events of 20 April 2011 arose from anger and frustration at having been held so long in immigration detention, he having arrived at Christmas Island in January 2010. I was not satisfied that he was a leader in what occurred; it appeared that his involvement was influenced by the actions of others.

124A psychologist found that Mr Dadash also exhibited signs of significant levels of depression and anxiety. Whilst I was not persuaded that there should be any moderation of the extent to which general deterrence should be taken into account, I did accept that a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily upon him because of his mental state. Separation from his wife and daughter who remained in Iran was a significant factor. 

125A particularly significant matter in the case of Mr Dadash was that he had applied to be returned to his home country but his application had been denied whilst criminal proceedings were pending against him. For this reason I accepted that his sentence should be backdated to 22 April 2011. That meant that he was entitled to immediate release on parole and that his total sentence expired on 21 January 2013. The presence of this factor in the case of Mr Dadash is the reason why I have noted in respect of each of the present offenders that they have not made any application to be removed from Australia.

Proportionality of sentences

126It is necessary to consider the cases of each of the present offenders together with that of Mahmood Dadash in order to assess sentences with an appropriate degree of proportionality.

127Putting aside the findings as to the mental condition of the present offenders and its partial contribution to their offending behaviour, I do not believe that there is any material difference in the level of objective seriousness of the offences of Mansoor and Darabi. Razai's offence is at a slightly lower level of seriousness because he only joined the others on the roof in the early evening whereas Mansoor and Darabi started their protest at the beginning of the day. 

128The individual actions of these three men, and of Dadash, were different but in terms of the seriousness of the offence, particularly having regard to the context in which the events occurred, it would be pedantic, tedious and of no practical utility to, for example, assess the gravity of one man throwing a tile against another man spraying and throwing a fire extinguisher at a member of staff, or the gravity of one man throwing more tiles from the roof than another.

129The subjective material relating to the present offenders varies, as would be expected, but the significance of such material to the assessment of sentence is broadly similar. 

130In the end, I have concluded that the same sentence should be imposed upon Mansoor and Darabi and a slightly lesser sentence upon Razai. The starting point for each will be less than that for Dadash.

131A significant point of distinction between Dadash and these men is that there was a basis upon which to backdate his sentence to the time that he was removed into corrective services custody and to take into account his subsequent time in immigration detention whilst on bail. If it had not been for the pending proceedings he most likely would have been released from detention and sent home. 

132That consideration does not apply to the present offenders. Their sentences can be backdated only to reflect the periods they spent in gaol prior to being granted bail. The fact that they might have been considered for community detention if it had not been for the pending proceedings is too uncertain for it to be taken into account in terms of identifying a period by which sentences might be backdated. However, the fact is that they have remained in a custodial environment and have been denied an opportunity for consideration of living in the community under a form of conditional liberty. It is a matter I have taken into account in my assessment of the overall sentence.

2761225,LB v R [2013] NSWCCA 70,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Button J and with his Honour's reasons.

2HIDDEN J: I agree with Button J.

3BUTTON J: On 26 August 2011 in the District Court of New South Wales, his Honour Judge Garling sentenced the applicant (to whom I shall refer, for reasons that will become apparent below, as LB) for two serious drug offences. Each matter came before his Honour by way of a plea of guilty.

4The first offence was, between 6 September 2007 and 30 October 2008 knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (commonly known as ecstasy) in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity of that drug. The second offence was, between 6 September 2007 and 30 October 2008 knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that drug. Each offence was contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Each offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life, and a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 15 years.

5With regard to count one, three further offences were taken into account on a Form 1. The first was that the applicant possessed a precursor for use in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. The second and third were expressed to be two counts of supplying an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug.

6The structure of the sentences imposed will be detailed later in this judgment. It suffices to say at this stage that a total head sentence of imprisonment for 12 years with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 8 years was imposed.

7The applicant seeks leave to appeal to this Court against those sentences. The single ground of appeal is ""[t]he sentencing judge gave the applicant an insufficient discount for his plea and assistance to the authorities.""

8Because of the need to maintain the personal security of the applicant, I shall refer to his co-offenders and various relevant addresses by pseudonyms. I shall also recount some of the objective and subjective features of the matter with more generality than would be usual.

Objective features

9A lengthy document entitled Agreed Facts was tendered before his Honour. His Honour summarised that document in the remarks on sentence. Neither party impugns that summary of his Honour, and it is convenient to adopt it. As I have indicated, alterations have been made to names of persons and places:

""In September 2007 a strike force was established to investigate the manufacture and distribution of prohibited drugs in western Sydney. The investigation involved electronic and physical surveillance of the offender and co-offenders Eastman, Jimson, Zabul, Druitt, Merton and Stubbs. It is the Crown's case against the offender that, throughout the time period covered in the indictment, the offender was provided with chemicals that were then used in the manufacture of prohibited drugs. The chemicals were sourced by the co-offender, Zabul, from the co-accused, Druitt. I should point out that there are co-offenders and co-accused because two persons have pleaded guilty while others have not. The chemicals provided by Zabul were used in various methods of manufacturing methylamphetamine and MDMA. During the investigation police conducted physical surveillance of the offender and a number of controlled operations were also conducted.

During the time of the operation the offender was living at Rosebery. He had a lease over a property at Earlwood. It is the Crown case that between September 2007 and October 2008 the offender was taking part in the manufacture of two prohibited drugs, one being ecstasy and the other methylamphetamine. The manufactures were being conducted at two separate locations. The first of the laboratories, which was being used to manufacture MDMA or ecstasy, was located at Earlwood. This was the premises then leased by the offender of the matter referred to in count 1 on the indictment. The offender was primarily involved in this side of the operation.

It is the Crown case that the second laboratory was at Burwood. This manufacture was being overseen by Eastman. The offender knowingly took part in the manufacture by sharing chemicals and knowledge with Eastman. They were then used to manufacture methylamphetamine and that relates to count 2. 

Throughout the time period covered in the indictment, the offender, together with co-offender Eastman, knowingly took part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine and ecstasy from chemicals sourced from Zabul and Druitt. On one occasion the offender and Eastman attempted to enlist the police undercover operative to assist in the production of a precursor to be used in the manufacture of ecstasy. During the period contained in the indictment the offender was seen interacting with the co-accused and attending various premises used to store chemicals and equipment used in the manufacture of prohibited drugs. 

On 30 October 2008 a number of search warrants were executed at various locations relating to the offender and co-offenders' homes and businesses. At Earlwood police located a clandestine drug laboratory. This laboratory was examined by a forensic chemist. Equipment used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine was located at the address in Burwood. This was also examined by the forensic chemist. During the search warrants police located a large amount of chemicals relating to the manufacture of prohibited drugs, tablet binding agents, manufacturing apparatus, including glassware, drug manufacturing recipes, a tablet press and various types and amounts of prohibited drugs. There is then listed details of the investigation, not all of those directly involve the offender. 

On 9 May 2008 the offender contacted Eastman about sourcing twenty kilograms of iodine. The two also spoke about Zabul sourcing a known person to provide information about the manufacture of prohibited drugs and a meeting was scheduled. 

On 21 May 2008, Zabul asked about the availability of 40 litres of a chemical, Xylene, for the offender. It is used in the manufacture of prohibited drugs. 

On 19 August 2008 a telephone call was intercepted between the offender and Eastman discussing certain issues they were having with Zabul. The offender told Eastman that he was sick of meeting with Druitt and attending those meetings with Zabul. Eastman stated that the only thing Zabul had done was introduce Toby or Druitt in relation to his involvement in the enterprise. The offender mentions his anger towards Zabul and mentioned the amount of money paid to Druitt for his ..(not transcribable).. Eastman during the conversation, mentioned the list being drawn up and the Crown rely very much on that piece of evidence. 

On 15 September 2008 Druitt asked the offender exactly what he wanted because there were a couple of different concentrations and formulations involved with the chemistry. Druitt asked the offender to write it down exactly how he wanted it, either analytically or technical type. The offender informed Druitt that he would write it down and give it to Zabul to pass on to him. 

On 16 September 2008 the police undercover operative met with Eastman and the offender at a hotel in West Ryde. The meeting and conversation was recorded. During the meeting Eastman and the offender enquired about using the undercover operative to manufacture sixty litres of sassafras oil in their possession. They discussed the intricate details, particularly manufacturing methods which they believe would convert the oil into MDP2P. They told the operative that they have a number of chemicals which could be used in the manufacture and also property in the Nyngan area. They also told him that they had access to a tablet press and the final product could be pressed by that. A list of chemicals was supplied to the undercover operative and he was asked to make enquiries about other chemicals needed to convert sassafras oil. At the conclusion of the meeting the offender and the undercover operative went to Eastman's vehicle. He handed two samples of what was to be P2P to have its purity examined. 

On 26 September 2008 there was a meeting between Zabul and the offender, a meeting between Eastman and the offender on 2 October and on 3 October the offender contacted Eastman and told him he had broken the condenser and needed one to replace it. On 29 October 2008 Zabul contacted the offender and told him that Druitt had three items from the list. He said:

'Remember when you give me that piece of paper with the three things on it? He's got the one that starts with A, it sounds like anaesthetic and the second name is hate.'

The conversation was in relation to an order placed with Druitt for various items.

Subsequently search warrants were executed. Relevant to this sentence was a search warrant at Earlwood. These were the premises of the offender. He was not there during the searches. During the search police located items in the garage and rear garden shed consistent with the manufacture of prohibited drugs. A chemist attended the search and declared the site a clandestine drug laboratory. The chemicals and equipment located at the address were analysed and in the expert's opinion pseudoephedrine had been manufactured by extracting at the premises, methylamphetamine had been manufactured by synthesis and there were materials present which could be used in the production of at least 250,000 ecstasy tablets. The expert was also of the opinion that the position and location of materials in the garage were indicative of an ongoing process. 

It is the Crown's case that part of the quantity of ecstasy produced at this laboratory included 5,000 tablets on-sold by Eastman referred to in para 18 of the facts and 10,000 tablets on-sold by Eastman referred to in paras 45 to 49. It is the Crown case that the offender knowingly took part in the manufacture of large commercial quantities of ecstasy at the premises, together with the co-accused Eastman and Zabul using chemicals sourced from Druitt. 

A search warrant was also executed at a different address in Rosebery. The premises belonged to the offender's parents. Police located a large amount of chemicals in and around the shed at the back of the property and in the offender's bedroom. They also located a residential tenancy agreement in the name of the offender for the premises at Earlwood. He was subsequently arrested upon return to Australia and has been in custody since 19 September 2010."" 

Subjective features

10The applicant was born in September 1979. Accordingly when he stood for sentence he was 31 years of age, and is now aged 33 years.

11He pleaded guilty at an early stage, and received a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian benefit of the plea. Neither party impugns that discount on appeal. His Honour also accepted that the applicant was remorseful.

12The applicant was born overseas and came to live in Australia in 1992 as a youth. He grew up in a happy, close-knit family. He received a sound high school education, completed a course at TAFE, and is described as a good worker.

13Unfortunately, for a long time the applicant has had a serious problem with illicit drugs. It began with experimentation when he was aged 20 and eventually grew to a point where it was out of control. The drugs include ecstasy, methylamphetamine, ketamine, and crack cocaine. For three years, during a happy romantic relationship, he was able to avoid using illicit drugs. Tragically, his partner suffered a miscarriage, she and the applicant separated, he fell into depression, and thereafter he returned to the abuse of illicit drugs.

14In the latter part of 2008, he departed Australia and returned to the country of his birth. By that stage he was using illicit drugs liberally, drinking heavily, and had a number of serious health issues. His trip overseas was an attempt to ""get clean"", and he succeeded. By that stage he had formed a new romantic relationship, as a result of which a son was born. In 2010, he did not hide his return to this country from Australian authorities, despite his knowledge that he would be immediately arrested. He has been in custody ever since. 

15His Honour accepted that, as at the date of sentence, the applicant was free from drugs.

16The criminal record of the applicant was not unblemished, and commenced in 1998. It features some property offences that are consistent with dependence on illicit drugs. It does not contain previous offences to do with the manufacture or supply of prohibited drugs. And it shows that the applicant had never previously been sentenced to imprisonment.

17There was no evidence placed before his Honour that the applicant would suffer unusually restricted conditions of custody.

Sentences of co-offenders

18Although erroneous disparity is not a ground of appeal, for reasons that will become apparent later in this judgement, it is necessary to recount briefly the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders, and the factual background with regard to each of them.

19The man whom I have called Eastman was sentenced by his Honour Judge Sides QC in March 2011. Eastman pleaded guilty to three counts: two of them were identical to those for which the applicant was sentenced, and there was a further count of supplying methylamphetamine in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity. That offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life with a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 15 years. Eastman pleaded guilty and received a discount of 20 per cent. He was at the top of the organisation. He was 34 years of age when he was sentenced. He was not in a position to rely upon good character, but his criminal record did not reveal previous drug offences. His Honour found that Eastman was remorseful, had experienced a dysfunctional upbringing, and suffered ""poor emotional health"".

20Judge Sides QC sentenced Eastman to a head sentence of imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years for the count of manufacturing not less than the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine that was shared with the applicant. A wholly concurrent sentence was imposed for the extra count that was not shared with the applicant. A head sentence of imprisonment for 18 years with a non-parole period imprisonment for 11 years was imposed for the count of manufacturing not less than the large commercial quantity of ecstasy that was shared with the applicant. That sentence commenced three years after the commencement of the sentence for manufacturing methylamphetamine. The total head sentence was therefore imprisonment for 21 years with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 14 years. 

21Judge Sides QC also sentenced the man whom I have called Zabul. Zabul faced counts that were identical to those of the applicant. Zabul also pleaded guilty, and received a 20 per cent discount. His position in the hierarchy was below that of the applicant. His criminal record included prior drug offences, and he had been imprisoned for such offences on previous occasions. Zabul was not found to be remorseful. He suffered from depression, and has an autistic child.

22On the count of being knowingly concerned in the manufacture of not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, Judge Sides QC sentenced Zabul to a head sentence of imprisonment for 5 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months. On the count of manufacturing not less than a large commercial quantity of ecstasy, Zabul was sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 4 years. That sentence was expressed to commence three years after the sentence for manufacturing methylamphetamine. Accordingly, a total head sentence of imprisonment for 11 years with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 7 years was imposed upon Zabul.

Assistance

23An important feature of the sentencing of the applicant was the fact that he had provided assistance to the authorities. It is convenient to set out everything that Judge Garling said in the remarks on sentence about that topic, including the application of discounts as a result: 

""... There is a significant matter I have to take into account, that significant matter is that the offender has offered to assist. I am not going into details of that, I am not placing them on the record. What I will place on the record is this, that having considered what was said I intend to allow an overall discount of about twenty-five per cent for that assistance, which I allow at about ten per cent from the past and fifteen per cent for the future. That would include giving evidence, of course, which he has undertaken to do.

In addition to that I also have to take into account that I am giving him a twenty-five per cent reduction for his plea of guilty, whereas in the other two sentences the reduction was twenty per cent, therefore there is a difference of five per cent. In other words, he is entitled to a discount of approximately, and I say approximately because mathematics do not always help one in these, thirty per cent on the sentence I would have imposed, and of course I have to take into account the question of parity.

Having done all that, I concluded that a head sentence which I should have imposed on this offender was one of seventeen years imprisonment. However, when I discount that, it then reduces to an overall sentence of twelve years imprisonment. When I looked at the non-parole periods, as far as parity was concerned, they varied somewhere between sixty-four and sixty-six per cent, and that then allowed me to reach the non-parole period of eight years that I have.""

Sentences Imposed

24As I have already indicated, the applicant received a total head sentence of imprisonment for 12 years with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 8 years. That was structured as follows. With regard to the count relating to the manufacture of methylamphetamine, the applicant received a head sentence of imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 3 years. On the count relating to the manufacture of ecstasy, the applicant received a head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment of 5 years. That sentence was expressed to commence at the end of the non-parole period of the methylamphetamine offence related to the manufacture of methylamphetamine. 

25Clearly, special circumstances were found that led to the ratio between the total non-parole period and the total head sentence being 66.6 per cent as opposed to 75 per cent. His Honour indicated that that finding was based upon the need for rehabilitation and the fact that it would be the first time in custody of the applicant.

Statute

26In light of the ground that I have already set out, it is convenient at this stage to set out the relevant section of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: 

""23 Power to reduce penalties for assistance provided to law enforcement authorities

(1) A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.

(2) In deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty for an offence and the nature and extent of the penalty it imposes, the court must consider the following matters:

(a) (Repealed)

(b) the significance and usefulness of the offender's assistance to the authority or authorities concerned, taking into consideration any evaluation by the authority or authorities of the assistance rendered or undertaken to be rendered,

(c) the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender,

(d) the nature and extent of the offender's assistance or promised assistance,

(e) the timeliness of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(f) any benefits that the offender has gained or may gain by reason of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(g) whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(h) any injury suffered by the offender or the offender's family, or any danger or risk of injury to the offender or the offender's family, resulting from the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(i) whether the assistance or promised assistance concerns the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an unrelated offence,

(j) (Repealed)

(3) A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

(4) A court that imposes a lesser penalty under this section on an offender because the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities must:

(a) indicate to the offender, and make a record of the fact, that the lesser penalty is being imposed for either or both of those reasons, and

(b) state the penalty that it would otherwise have imposed, and

(c) where the lesser penalty is being imposed for both reasons-state the amount by which the penalty has been reduced for each reason.

(5) Subsection (4) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(6) The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (4) with respect to any sentence does not invalidate the sentence.""

Submissions on behalf of the applicant

27The submissions of senior counsel for the applicant may be summarised as follows. 

28His basic point was that error was revealed when one undertakes a simple mathematical comparison between the total of the discounts referred to by his Honour (50 per cent) and the discount ultimately applied (30 per cent). He submitted that the ""discount given is not logical, does not accord with his Honour's stated intention and, in any event, is inadequate.""

29He submitted that the applicant should be re-sentenced in accordance with the following analysis: the starting point was a total head sentence of imprisonment for 17 years. Applying a total discount of 50 per cent, the total head sentence would be imprisonment for 8 years 6 months. Setting a total non-parole period that is two-thirds of the total head sentence, as his Honour did, would lead to a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 5 years 8 months. 

30In short, senior counsel for the applicant submitted that the overarching sentence structure for the two offences should be a total head sentence of imprisonment for 8 years 6 months with a total non-parole period of 5 years 8 months. 

31At the hearing, senior counsel eschewed a desire to explore what he described as ""deeper issues"" with regard to sentencing in cases where there is to be a discount given for assistance. He stated that he did not ""quibble"" with a starting point of 17 years. He submitted that perhaps the sentences imposed on the applicant should not have been wholly cumulative with regard to their non-parole periods. 

32With regard to the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders, he submitted that there may be a number of errors with regard to them. In any event, he submitted that error had been established with regard to the sentences imposed upon the applicant, and the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders could not stand in the way of re-sentencing by this Court.

33Senior counsel for the applicant proposed that the Court ""does this in an expedient way and just takes the sentences as they are and then applies a discount to that without otherwise fiddling with them too much"".

Submissions of the Crown

34In written submissions, senior counsel for the Crown accepted that the way in which a combined discount of 30 per cent was reached was ""not clear"". However, she submitted that ""[t]he impression is that the overall discount applied was the discount that was intended."" 

35At the time of the preparation of the written submissions, the Crown had not seen the sealed evidence of assistance. At that stage, she submitted that a discount of 50 per cent would be excessive.

36Having seen the documents, the Crown maintained the position at the hearing that ""[i]t's not at all clear what his Honour was attempting to do when he turned to dealing with the issue of assistance."" She submitted that perhaps the approach of his Honour was an attempt to comply with, on the one hand, s 23(3) and, and on the other, s 23(4). 

37She maintained the position that, despite first appearances, what his Honour said was not a mathematical mistake, but rather an attempt to synthesise the two subsections.

38She resisted the proposition that a discount in the order of 50 per cent was appropriate. She submitted that a discount of between 20 per cent and 40 per cent would be appropriate. She referred in particular to R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92, SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249 and Brown v R, R v Brown [2010] NSWCCA 73. 

39After examining its contents, she submitted that the sealed envelope did not reveal ""the highest level of assistance"". 

40The Crown submitted that, if this Court found error and moved to re-sentencing, then regard would need to be had to the sentences imposed upon the two co-offenders.

Determination

41I respectfully consider that error has been established. In particular I do not consider that the sentence imposed complies with s 23(4). As the Chief Justice remarked during the hearing, if the applicant were to withdraw his offer to co-operate in the future, one would not be in a position to say with precision what was the discount provided for future assistance, for the purposes of a Crown appeal pursuant to s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

42I do not consider that his Honour made a mathematical slip. Rather I respectfully infer that his Honour was seeking to comply with the somewhat competing requirements of s 23(3) and s 23(4).

43Although there is a long line of authority about discounts for assistance to the authorities stretching back to the decision in R v Perez-Vargas (1986) 8 NSWLR 559, there has been little authority of this Court with regard to ss 23(4)-(6). That is because those subsections did not commence until 14 March 2011. Johnson J provided the background to the insertion of those provisions in R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38 at [74] - [75]:

""Basten JA and Adams J refer to s.23(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This provision was inserted by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2010, which commenced on 14 March 2011. The second reading speech in support of the Bill indicated that it gave effect to recommendations made by the Sentencing Council in its report of August 2009 entitled ""Reduction in Penalties at Sentence"". The Parliamentary Secretary, the Hon Michael Veitch, indicated that the Government had agreed to implement all the recommendations of the Council in the Bill (Legislative Council, Hansard, 23 November 2010). With respect to the enactment of s.23(4)-(6), the Parliamentary Secretary said:

'Item [6] of schedule 1.2 also relates to the consideration of imposing a lesser penalty as a result of assistance provided by the offender. Frequently an offender may promise assistance that will be given after sentencing takes place - for example by giving evidence at a later trial. This promise is appropriately considered when setting the sentence. However, where the offender reneges on the promise, appeal courts need to be able to deprive the person of the discount given for the future assistance when the person is to be re-sentenced. To facilitate this process the amendment will require the court to outline the extent to which the sentence has been reduced both for any assistance already given and separately for any assistance promised. This will significantly assist courts in revisiting the sentence should the promised assistance not be forthcoming.'

It appears from the second reading speech and the Sentencing Council's Report (paragraphs 8.48-8.50) that the amendment was intended to require a sentencing Judge to indicate the reduction in sentence flowing from assistance so as to facilitate later attention to be given to the subject, in the event of a Crown appeal under s.5DA Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a reduced sentence, if the offender fails wholly or partly to fulfil an undertaking to assist law enforcement authorities. The enactment of s.23(4) appears to have been intended to bring the New South Wales provision into closer alignment with s.21E Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)."" 


44In short, to comply with the section as a whole, it seems to me that, in cases where a discount is to be given for a plea of guilty, and past and future assistance, it is appropriate in many, if not most, cases to indicate the discount for all three. That is because s 23(4) requires that a sentencing judge indicate the penalty that would have been imposed but for the assistance, and s 23(4)(c) requires that a sentencing judge indicate the amount by which that sentence has been reduced for each of past and future assistance. And whilst it is true that s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act does not mandate statement of the discount given for a plea of guilty, it is very common and useful for sentencing judges to indicate explicitly the extent of any such discount. 

45It does not seem to me that compliance with ss 23(3) and 23(4) can be fulfilled by a statement of individual discounts followed by a process of ""compression"" of them in order to achieve a result that does not contravene s 23(3). As I have said, perhaps that was the approach adopted by his Honour here. Rather, it seems to me that s 23(3) simply requires that the ultimate sentence not be unreasonably disproportionate. If the individual discounts that first come to mind would have that result, in combination with each other, then the discounts should, in my opinion, be reduced before the final determination of their quantum. 

46This approach may lead to somewhat short discounts for past and future assistance in cases where a substantial discount has also been given for an early plea of guilty. But that is the result of long-standing authority of this Court, acting in combination with the requirements of the section: see R v Sukkar, SZ v R and Brown v R, R v Brown.

47Error having been established, it is necessary to consider whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law, and, if so, proceed to re-sentence.

Section 6(3) the Criminal Appeal Act 

48Each party was content for this Court, if it came to re-sentence, to adopt the findings by his Honour with regard to the objective and subjective features of the matter, other than those with regard to assistance. I shall do so. I also adopt the starting point identified by his Honour of a total head sentence of 17 years, again without demurrer by either party. 

49Nor is there any reason not to grant a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. 

50I have considered the contents of the sealed envelope for myself. I shall not go into detail for obvious reasons. In evaluating that material as a whole, I shall briefly advert to the matters contained in ss 23(2)(a) - 23(2)(i).

51Considering what the law enforcement authorities have said about the assistance both past and future, I consider that the assistance is of significance and substantial usefulness.

52On the material before me, there is nothing to gainsay the proposition that the material is truthful, complete and reliable.

53I regard the nature of the assistance and promised assistance as generally being of a high order. It is detailed and specific. Having said that, I do not regard it as exceptional.

54The assistance was only provided after the applicant was arrested.

55There is no evidence of any benefits that have accrued to the applicant apart from the discount under discussion. 

56Nor, as I have said, is there evidence that the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a result of his actions.

57There is no evidence of injury to the offender or the family of the offender as a result of what he has done. However, there is evidence of significant danger and risk of injury to the offender and his family.

58The assistance and promised assistance concern the involvement of others in the offence for which the offender is being sentenced.

59In short, I assess the assistance, both past and future provided by the applicant as of substantial but not exceptional value.

60Exercising my own sentencing discretion, for the totality of the assistance I would provide a further discount of 15 per cent, comprised of 5 per cent for past assistance and 10 per cent for future assistance. 

61Three things may be said about my evaluation. The first is that it is the result of my own independent assessment of the assistance and its surrounding circumstances, in accordance with the mandatory considerations contained in s 23.

62The second is that I have applied the long-standing principle enunciated by Howie J at [5] in R v Sukkar that: 

""In my opinion discounts for a plea and assistance of more than 40 per cent should be very exceptionally, if at all, granted in a case where there is no evidence that the offender will spend the sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population. It should now be accepted that an offender who has provided assistance will not necessarily be disadvantaged in the prison system and, if the offender wishes to assert otherwise, he or she should lead evidence of that fact.""

That proposition has been applied many times by this Court: see the review of the authorities by Johnson J in R v Ehrlich at [67]. 

63The third is that I would regard any lesser sentence than a total head sentence of imprisonment for 10 years as being unreasonably disproportionate and therefore contravening s 23(3).

64There has been a degree of divergence of opinion in this Court as to whether discounts for a plea of guilty and for providing assistance should be applied sequentially or globally. As to the former approach, see: R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162 at [70] and SZ v R at [10]. As to the latter, see: R v Waqa (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 33; (2005) 156 A Crim R 454 at [10] - [12]. In R v Ehrlich, Basten JA said at [10] - [12]

""In relation to the third matter, the sentencing judge assessed the respective discounts for the guilty plea and for assistance to authorities and combined them to identify the appropriate sentence. No error of law was asserted in undertaking this course, nor is any error manifest.

Adams J refers to authority which appears to support the proposition that discounts should be applied consecutively. That approach was adopted by the Court in R v NP [2003] NSWCCA 195 at [30] (Hodgson JA) and [47] (Simpson J). In R v El Hani the Court accepted this approach ""in a case where it is appropriate to specify individual discounts"": at [70]. There is no reason to doubt that conclusion: however, the inference (implicit though not expressed) that it is incorrect to add the discounts, so as to achieve a single global figure applied to the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed, should not be assumed without demonstration. No authority or statutory support for the adoption of one approach rather than another was relied on in the cases noted above. Nor does s 23 necessarily require either process to the exclusion of the other. For example, for the Court to state the penalty which it would ""otherwise have imposed"" no doubt refers to the appropriate penalty disregarding only the assistance to authorities. It says nothing as to the manner in which the discounting is to be achieved. Indeed, on one view, the manner in which it is achieved is irrelevant: the selected reduction can be expressed in a number of different ways, none of which is prohibited.

The fact that no objection was taken to the cumulative discount approach in this case supports the view that it is commonplace to adopt such an approach, regardless of what was said in R v NP and El Hani. Indeed members of the Court in those cases have, in other cases, accepted or applied the cumulative approach.""

65I am content in this matter to apply a global discount of 40% to the starting point total head sentence of imprisonment for 17 years. That results in a total head sentence of imprisonment for 10 years 2 months. 

66Turning to structural aspects of re-sentence, I see no reason to depart from the decision of his Honour to find special circumstances and to impose a total non-parole period that is two-thirds of the total head sentence. 

67Nor do I propose to depart from the structure of his Honour whereby sentences were imposed partly concurrently with regard to head sentences, but fully cumulatively with regard to non-parole periods.

68If the combined effect of the adoption of such a structure and application of two discounts to the starting point leads to a few days of custody here or there, they will be rounded down, on the basis that the law does not concern itself with trifles. And in order to achieve a total head sentence of 10 years 2 months with a total non-parole period that is two-thirds of that sentence, very small mathematical adjustments will need to be made to the constituent sentences and their non-parole periods. 

69I have reflected on such a sentence with an eye to the sentences imposed upon Eastman and Zabul. Balancing the objective and subjective features of all three offenders recounted by me above, I consider that the individual sentences and total sentence proposed do not demonstrate erroneous disparity and fit comfortably within the hierarchy of sentences.

70Finally, I reiterate that any lesser total head sentence than the one I propose would, in my opinion, ultimately be ""unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances"" of the two offences. It will be recalled that each carried with it a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of 15 years, and that the criminality they encompassed was that of an offender who played a substantial role in a sophisticated and ongoing operation directed towards the manufacture of very large quantities of prohibited drugs.

71In short, I am satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted in law, and that this Court should proceed to re-sentence. 

Orders

72The effect of the orders that I propose will be a new total head sentence of 10 years 2 months with a new total non-parole period of 6 years 10 months, each to date from 19 September 2010.

73I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal against sentence granted.

(2)Appeal against sentence allowed.

(3)Both sentences are quashed.

(4)With regard to count two of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, the Court imposes a non-parole period of imprisonment for 2 years 7 months to commence on 19 September 2010 and expire on 18 April 2013, with a parole period of 1 year 8 months to commence on 19 April 2013 and expire on 18 December 2014.

(5)With regard to count one of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of not less than a large commercial quantity of 3,4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the Court imposes a non-parole period of imprisonment for 4 years 3 months to date from 19 April 2013 and expire on 18 July 2017, with a parole period of 3 years 4 months to date from 19 July 2017 and expire on 18 November 2020.

(6)The earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible to be considered for release to parole is 18 July 2017.

2761232,Boyd v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 67,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Button J.

2BELLEW J: I agree with Button J.

3BUTTON J: On 7 March 2013, this Court delivered judgment dismissing an appeal against conviction, but varying the commencement date of the single sentence under appeal. That latter step was taken with the concurrence of both parties. That sentence featured a head sentence of imprisonment for 7 years 6 months with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 4 years. It was imposed for an offence of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug.

4The Court has been informed by a solicitor acting for the applicant that, on 8 June 2012 in the Local Court of New South Wales at Penrith, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 months as a result of a conviction for being an inmate of a prison in possession of a mobile phone. That term of imprisonment was expressed to commence at the end of the non-parole period of the sentence of which the commencement date was adjusted in this Court. The commencement date of the sentence of 2 months was 29 May 2015. 

5Some time later, an appeal to the District Court of New South Wales with regard to that sentence was dismissed. 

6Pursuant to the orders of this Court, the non-parole period of the sentence for the drug offence now expires on 13 January 2015. It can be seen that there will arise in the future a lacuna in the custody of the applicant that requires correction. 

7Section 59 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""The Act"") is as follows:

""Court may vary commencement of sentence on quashing or varying other sentence

(1) A court that quashes or varies a sentence of imprisonment imposed on a person (on appeal or otherwise) may vary the date of commencement of any other sentence that has been imposed on that person by that or any other court.

(2) If a person is subject to two or more sentences, this section applies to each of them.

(3) A court may vary a sentence under this section on its own initiative or on the application of a party to the proceedings on the quashing or variation of the other sentence.

(4) An appeal does not lie merely because the date of commencement of a sentence is varied under this section.

(5) The term of a sentence, or the non-parole period of a sentence, cannot be varied under this section.""


8It is appropriate for this Court to exercise its powers under s 59(1) of the Act to adjust the commencement date of the sentence of imprisonment for 2 months, so that is commences at the end of the non-parole period of the lengthy sentence. Both the solicitor for the applicant and the Crown agree that that wholly mechanistic adjustment should be made, and are in agreement as to the precise order.

9Accordingly, I propose the following order:

(1)Pursuant to s 59 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the commencement date of the fixed term of imprisonment for 2 months imposed upon the applicant on 8 June 2012 is varied from 29 May 2015 to 14 January 2015.

		05 April 2013",2013-04-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761236,ADZIOSKI v R [2013] NSWCCA 69,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offence and sentenceOn 5 April 2012 the applicant was sentenced by Judge Zahra SC in respect of the following count:That he on 22 October 2010 between Wolli Creek and Riverwood did attempt to have sexual intercourse with RC, without the consent of RC, knowing she was not consenting and she being a person with a cognitive impairment, contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years.
2His Honour was also asked to take into account on a Form 1, an offence of ""aggravated act of indecency"" (person with cognitive impairment) contrary to s 61O(1A) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 3 years.
3His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years, commencing 22 October 2010, and expiring 21 October 2014, with a balance of term of 2 years, expiring 21 October 2016.  The applicant will be eligible for release to parole on 21 October 2014.
4The applicant seeks leave to appeal from this sentence on the following grounds:
Ground 1:  The learned sentencing judge erred in that he failed to give any or any adequate weight to the applicant's mental illness as it affected(a) the moral culpability of the applicant;(b) the significance of general deterrence; and(c) the significance of specific deterrence.
Ground 2:  The learned sentencing judge erred in treating the vulnerability arising from the victim's cognitive impairment as an aggravating feature.
Ground 3:  The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
Factual Background
5The victim, RC, was a 24 year old female who suffered from a mild intellectual disability.  As a result, she satisfied the criteria for a ""cognitive impairment"" as defined in s 61H(1A) of the Crimes Act 1900.  The victim resided with her parents and was unemployed.  Her father suffered from a learning disability.  
Count 1
6At about 7.45pm on Friday 22 October 2010 the victim and her father boarded a train at Wolli Creek train station to travel to Riverwood.  The applicant boarded the train at the same time.  The victim sat on a seat on the entrance level adjacent to the door.  Her father stood nearby.
7A short time after boarding the train, the applicant sat next to the victim, put his arm around her and spoke to her.  The victim told the offender to go away, stood up and walked to the lower level of the train carriage.  The applicant followed the victim to the lower level, sat next to her and again put his arm around her.  The applicant asked the victim whether she had a boyfriend and the victim told the applicant to leave her alone.  The applicant then reached over and lifted the victim's skirt.  The victim told the applicant to leave her alone.  The applicant ignored the victim and pulled down her underpants with both his hands.  The applicant then attempted to insert one of his fingers into her vagina.  The victim called out ""ouch it hurts, go away"".  By this time the victim observed that there were several people in the carriage looking towards her, however, none of the passengers came to her aid.  While the applicant was still trying to insert his finger into the victim's vagina, he said to her ""do you want some money for drink?""  The victim ignored him and after a while the applicant removed his hand.
Form 1 matter
8The applicant then pulled down his trousers, exposing his penis which was erect.  The victim stood up to leave but the applicant put his arm across her preventing her from doing so.  The victim sat back down and told the applicant she had to get off the train at Riverwood.  The victim, who was crying, again stood up and rushed to her father, hugged him and told him that the applicant had pulled her pants down and exposed his penis.
9The applicant followed the victim up the stairs and the victim's father told him to go away.  When the train stopped at Riverwood, the victim and her father left the train and informed the guard of the assault.  The train left the Riverwood train station with the applicant still aboard.
10The victim and her father walked to the Riverwood Police Station and reported the assault to police.  Staff at the Riverwood train station alerted transit police who met the train at Holsworthy train station.  Transit police detained the applicant and he was soon after taken into custody by NSW Police.  Due to the applicant's level of intoxication, he was unable to be interviewed and he was allowed time to recover.  Upon recovery, the applicant engaged in an electronically recorded interview.
11The applicant admitted that he had raised the victim's skirt, pulling down her underpants and placing his hands around her vagina and buttocks.  He also admitted trying to put his finger inside the victim's vagina and grabbing her as she tried to leave.  He admitted to removing his pants and exposing his erect penis to the victim.
12The applicant told police that he had consumed an unknown quantity of beer since lunchtime on 22 October 2010.  He said that he suffered from schizophrenia.  The applicant appeared coherent during the interview and was able to recall details of the evening.  He said that he knew that what he had done was unlawful.  
13Inquiries revealed that at the time of offending, the applicant was in breach of bail conditions.  He had been granted conditional bail at Kogarah Local Court on 22 April 2010 in relation to a number of charges.  The bail conditions included that he not consume alcohol.
Proceedings in District Court
14The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings.
15There was available to his Honour a report from Dr Elliott, who was a psychiatrist employed by JusticeHealth.  His report was requested by the court.  Dr Elliott conducted a psychiatric assessment of the applicant on 6 March 2012 at the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre.  After 30 minutes the interview was cut short, because Dr Elliott formed the opinion that the applicant's answers were not to be relied upon and the applicant had become hostile.
16His Honour also had before him, reports from another psychiatrist, Dr Adams, who had been retained by the applicant's solicitor.  The applicant saw Dr Adams on 26 January, 9 March, 7 September 2011 and 11 January 2012.  Dr Adams prepared reports dated 15 March and 14 September 2011 and 17 January 2012.  
17His Honour based his assessment of the applicant's mental health on the contents of those reports and on his assessment of the applicant.
18By reference to the report of Dr Elliott, his Honour noted that the applicant had been suffering from mental health problems since the age of 20 and that he had two involuntary admissions to psychiatric units.  He had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and had been prescribed anti-psychotic medication.  His compliance with that medication was irregular and Dr Elliott recorded that he had been non-compliant with his medication for approximately six months before this offence.  After his arrest and while on remand, the applicant was taking medication which included an anti-depressant, a mood stabiliser and anti-psychotic medication. 
19By reference to the applicant's medical records, Dr Elliott confirmed that the applicant had been consistently assessed as suffering from schizophrenia since the age of 20.  There was also a record of co-morbid problems with drug abuse, in particular amphetamines, cannabis and binge drinking.  Upon clinical presentation, the applicant exhibited a number of symptoms typical of schizophrenia.  Dr Elliott also concluded that the applicant ""had a co-morbid diagnosis of alcohol, cannabis, amphetamine/methamphetamine abuse or dependence and a possible previous opiate dependence"".  The applicant told Dr Elliott that he could not recall the circumstances of the offence and that his only memories were of boarding the train with the intention of attending his brother's residence, commencing drinking beer in a rapid manner at approximately midday and being in trouble with the state transit police.
20Dr Adams recorded that the applicant had been treated by a Mental Health Team in the months leading up to the offence which had reviewed him fortnightly.  Before the offending, he had not taken his prescribed medication as he felt he did not need to.  However, he told Dr Adams that during the period leading up to the offence, he was not feeling well.  Dr Adams recorded that the applicant described his mood as changing abruptly and frequently during the two week period before the offence.  He did not experience any features consistent with psychosis in the form of delusions or hallucinations during that period.  The applicant told Dr Adams that during that period ""I just wasn't feeling right ... I was out of it ... I was really fast ... I wasn't on my medication"".  He said that his thinking was ""all over the place"".
21The applicant told Dr Adams that before the offence, he had been intoxicated with alcohol every couple of days, but had not used illicit substances.  On the day of the offence, he had consumed approximately ten cans of beer, commencing at about 1pm.  At the time of the offence, he felt ""excited ... drunk ..."" and that his thought processes were ""really fast"".  He said that he was attracted to the victim and that he had experienced ""sexual thoughts"" but denied any planning of sexual assault before getting on the train.
22Dr Adams thought that the applicant's description of his mental state at the time of the offence was in keeping with ""disintegrated thought processes"".  He did not think that the applicant's account suggested that he was experiencing specific delusions or hallucinations at the time of the offence.  Dr Adams concluded:
""In my opinion on balance there are reasonable grounds to conclude that the offender was experiencing continuing features of thought disorder at the material time of the offence, which was probably compounded by his use of alcohol.  I believe it is likely that this presentation resulted in his impaired decision-making capacity and contributed to his disinhibited sexual behaviour.""
23In evidence during the proceedings on sentence, the applicant said that the reason that he stopped taking his medication a few months before the offence was on the advice of his general practitioner who wanted to trial him without medication.  
24His Honour had regard to the following subjective matters.  The applicant was aged 33 with no dependants.  At the time of the offending, he was living with both parents and working casually as a labourer.  He left school in year 10 and thereafter his employment was only intermittent.  He had not been involved in any long-term relationships.
25The applicant had a history of alcohol abuse, having commenced drinking at the age of 17 and thereafter regularly binge drinking.  There was a history of cannabis and amphetamine/methamphetamine use, also commencing at the age of 17 and escalating at times to daily use.  The applicant had experimented with other substances, such as cocaine, heroin and LSD.  He continued to drink to intoxication every couple of days.
26The applicant had a poor criminal record and had been convicted of a number of offences as a juvenile.  In May 2001 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years for an offence of aggravated assault with intent to rob.  At the time of this offence, the applicant was on bail which his Honour regarded as a significant aggravating factor.  
27In relation to the objective gravity of the offence, his Honour had regard to the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years as an indication of how seriously the community viewed such offences.  
28On this issue, his Honour said:
""An important step in determining the appropriate sentence is the assessment of where this particular aggravated sexual assault offence lies on the spectrum or scale of seriousness:  Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447.  It must be kept in mind in the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence that the Court is concerned here with the range of objective seriousness for the aggravated form of the offence.
There is little utility, in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending here, to first attempt to place the aggravating circumstances in s 61J into some kind of hierarchy.  As the circumstances in each case will be different, the individual case is best assessed by understanding what it is the offender did.
Here the objective seriousness of the offence lies substantially in the vulnerability of the victim, taking into account her impairment and her vulnerability in the situation she found herself in.  Further, the nature of the attempted sexual assault was of a most serious kind.
The victim did not know the offender.""  (ROS 11.6 - 12.1)
29His Honour noted that the victim attempted to get away from the applicant and that there was a level of persistence in his conduct.  Although the conduct caused the victim some pain, his Honour noted that the period of time involved was relatively short.  His Honour noted that even after the applicant had removed his hand, he continued to intimidate the victim causing her distress and causing her to cry.  His Honour accepted that while the applicant's actions were not accompanied by verbal threats, his conduct would have placed the victim in considerable fear.  Because his actions were in public, they were not only violent but also degrading and humiliating.
30His Honour concluded:
""The circumstances highlight the importance of deterrence, both general and specific, as a means of protecting vulnerable victims as they go about their day to day lives. ...  There is also a substantial impact upon the community generally.  The ability of members of the public to go freely about the streets without fear of violence is severely challenged by such attacks.  The community needs to be protected from such violent acts.""  (ROS 12.9 - 13.1)
31His Honour then analysed the effect of the applicant's mental illness on the sentencing process.
32His Honour said:
"" It is a well accepted principle that whereas general deterrence is a relevant consideration in every sentencing exercise, it is a consideration to which less weight should be given in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or severe intellectual handicap.  In some instances an offender may have limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or the moral culpability which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility, would justify a particular consideration upon sentencing.  The offender may not fully appreciate or understand, the nature of his or her offending, or the message that the sentence is expected to convey.
Whether general or specific deterrence should be moderated in an individual case depends upon the degree of impairment, the extent of its contribution to the offence, the nature and severity of the symptoms exhibited by the offender, and the effect of the condition on the mental capacity of the offender, whether at the time of the offending or at the date of sentence, or both - whether or not the sentence can be seen to have a deterrent value, either specifically or generally.""  (ROS 13.3 - 8)
33His Honour was aware of the tension between the proposition that mental illness may reduce a person's culpability and the need for greater weight to be given to the protection of the community where such offending might place the welfare of the community at risk.  This meant that the fact of mental illness might not result in a lesser sentence.  
34His Honour took into account that the fact of a mental illness might mean that a particular sentence would weigh more heavily on an offender than it would on a person of normal health.  He also noted that there may, in some cases, be a serious risk that imprisonment would have a significantly adverse effect on an offender's mental health.  His Honour accepted that the applicant was in protective custody.  Those considerations would be factors tending to mitigate punishment.
35When seeking to reconcile such considerations with others which might  tend towards a different result, his Honour took into account that the conduct constituting the offence had elements of irrationality in that it occurred in a railway carriage in the presence of members of the public.  His Honour took into account that there was no level of prior planning associated with the offence.  While the level of the applicant's intoxication might provide a complete answer to the offending, his Honour regarded such a result as overly simplistic in that it might artificially deny the presence of the underlying mental health condition.  His Honour concluded that the answer was likely to involve a synthesis of all of those factors.
36His Honour accepted that the symptoms of the applicant's mental illness were present in the days leading up to the offence.  These symptoms were aggravated by the consumption of significant amounts of alcohol.  On the other hand, his Honour took into account that the applicant was aware of what he was doing.  Despite his high level of intoxication, he was able to give an account of his offending when later interviewed and to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct.
37His Honour's conclusion was:
""Ultimately I am of the view that while the offending occurred in the context of an underlying mental condition and impaired decision making capacity that the nature of the offending requires a sentence to reflect the need for deterrence including a strong measure of specific deterrence.""  (ROS 14.9 - 15.1)
38His Honour accepted that the applicant was genuinely remorseful and had pleaded guilty at an early point in time.  By reference to the significant improvement which had occurred in the applicant's health while he was in custody and receiving treatment, his Honour accepted that upon his release it was important to link the applicant to an appropriate Community Mental Health Team to allow for a continued ""assertive follow-up"".  This would reduce the applicant's risk of future relapse of mental illness and therefore the likelihood of future offending behaviour.
39In the end, however, his Honour was unable to predict the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation.
""It is difficult to make any precise finding as to the offender's prospects of rehabilitation.  He has a significant inherent mental health condition which requires him to comply with treatment and a medication regime.  He has a poor compliance record.  The offending here involved significant sexual violence and he has a criminal history involving violence.""  (ROS 18.3)
Nevertheless, his Honour was prepared to find special circumstances.
40Because of his early plea of guilty, his Honour allowed the applicant a discount of 25 percent because of the utilitarian value of that plea.
41His Honour took into account the offence on the Form 1 and the guidance provided by Attorney-General's Application under section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146.  In that regard, his Honour noted that where there was a matter to be taken into account on a Form 1, in an appropriate case greater weight should be given to the need for personal deterrence and the community's entitlement to extract retribution.  In this case his Honour thought that the offending in the matter on the Form 1 was part of a continuous sequence of events, which included the conduct in the primary count, for which the applicant was being sentenced.
The appeal
Ground 1:  The learned sentencing judge erred in that he failed to give any or any adequate weight to the applicant's mental illness as it affected(a) the moral culpability of the applicant;(b) the significance of general deterrence; and(c) the significance of specific deterrence.
42The applicant submitted that the evidence was that at the time of the offending, he was suffering from a mental illness in the nature of schizophrenia, complicated by co-morbid substance abuse, in particular alcohol.  The psychiatric evidence was unanimous that the applicant's mental illness contributed to the commission of the offence in that his thoughts were disordered and ""disintegrated"".  The applicant accepted his Honour's finding that it was a combination of his mental illness and his intoxication which contributed to the offending.
43In the light of that evidence, the applicant challenged the conclusion arrived at by his Honour:
""Ultimately I am of the view that whilst the offending occurred in the context of an underlying mental condition and impaired decision making capacity, that the nature of the offending requires the sentence to reflect the need for deterrence, including a strong measure of specific deterrence.""  (ROS 14.09)
44The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in his approach to moral culpability.  The applicant submitted that although his Honour referred to the fact that mental illness might reduce a person's moral culpability, he did not make any finding as to whether in his case his moral culpability was in fact reduced.  The applicant submitted that although he acknowledged the wrongfulness of his conduct, that did not detract from the fact that his thought processes were disordered and that his mental illness contributed to his disinhibited sexual behaviour. 
45The applicant submitted that his Honour's failure to make a finding as to whether or not his moral culpability was reduced was an error that affected the whole of the reasoning and in particular, the sentence ultimately imposed.  The applicant submitted that when all the evidence was taken into account, the inevitable conclusion should have been that his moral culpability was reduced.  The applicant submitted that a finding to that effect was relevant to most aspects of punishment, i.e. deterrence, retribution and denunciation. 
46Alternatively, the applicant submitted that if his Honour had made an assessment of moral culpability, his Honour had not properly taken that finding into account in that the sentence which he imposed was based substantially on considerations of deterrence and retribution.  The applicant submitted that his Honour's focus upon deterrence in the sentencing process in effect disregarded the evidence as to mental illness and the findings which his Honour had made as to the relationship between that mental illness and the offending.  The applicant submitted that in relation to general deterrence, there was no consideration by his Honour as to the appropriateness of using him as a ""medium by which to deter others from offending"" (Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 240 CLR 120 at [55]).
47The Crown responded by submitting that sentencing a mentally ill offender for a serious crime required the exercise of a ""sensitive discretionary decision"" because of the need to resolve what were often competing considerations (Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 476, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67).  The Crown submitted that even where the psychiatric condition was relevant or even central to the commission of the offence, it did not necessarily follow that significant leniency should be extended to the offender (Devaney v R [2012] NSWCCA 285 at [74] ff).  It submitted that in some cases there was a commensurate increase in the need to protect the public (Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [83]).  The Crown submitted that even where mental illness made a contribution to the offending, considerations of both general and personal deterrence remained relevant although their significance might be reduced.  This was particularly so when the offender acted with knowledge of what he or she was doing and with knowledge of the gravity of the offending.
48The Crown referred specifically to R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 51.  There the offender's psychotic state was self-induced as a result of his failure to take his medication and his deliberate taking of drugs.  Hunt CJ at CL stated at 52:
""... By his recklessness in bringing on the psychotic episodes [the applicant] is a continuing danger to the community,  a matter which would in any event reduce - if not eradicate - the mitigation which would otherwise be given for the respondent's mental condition.""
The Crown referred also to Benitez v R [2006] NSWCCA 21; 160 A Crim R 166 at [41] - [42], Cole v R [2010] NSWCCA 227 at [71] - [73] and R v Burnett [2011] NSWCCA 276.  The Crown relied on Taylor v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 7 where McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Howie and Latham JJ agreed) said:
""30 ... [Because the appellant was] aware of the state he was in and the effect upon him of sleep deprivation, together with the effect of beer and marijuana, but nevertheless elected to drive, his impaired psychological state could not play a significant part in determining the ultimate sentence.""
49The Crown submitted that his Honour was conscious of these competing considerations and referred to all of them in his judgment.  The Crown submitted that the ultimate resolution of these issues by his Honour involved an exercise of discretion in relation to which error had not been demonstrated.  The Crown disputed the applicant's primary proposition that his Honour had failed to make a finding as to his moral culpability and that this failure had led to error in the sentencing process in that his Honour should have found that the applicant's moral culpability was significantly reduced because of his mental illness.  The Crown submitted that one only had to look at his Honour's specific findings as to mental illness, and as to the applicant's conduct leading up to the offending, for it to be clear that his Honour was well aware of this principle and took it into account.
Consideration
50It is not correct to say that his Honour did not take into account the applicant's moral culpability.  When discussing relevant principles (at ROS 13.4), his Honour specifically referred to it.  Later, in the context of sentencing principles pointing in different directions, his Honour said:
""Even though mental illness may reduce a person's culpability, it does not necessarily follow that the fact of mental illness results in a lesser sentence.""
51His Honour's reference to ""culpability"" is clearly a reference to ""moral culpability"".  It is also clear from his Honour's review of the facts that he was well aware, not only of the fact of the applicant's mental illness, but also that it reduced the applicant's moral culpability.  In reaching his conclusions, his Honour set that off against the countervailing consideration that the applicant ""was aware of the nature of his conduct ... was able to give an account of his offending when later interviewed and acknowledged the wrongfulness of his conduct"".
52A matter which his Honour did not analyse but which was important in oral submissions was that some months before the offending, the applicant had ceased taking his anti-psychotic medication.  When cross-examined as to this issue, the evidence was:
""Q.  In fact you told your psychiatrist, Dr Adams, in relation to taking your medication, you were given medication but you weren't taking them and you told Dr Adams ""I felt like I didn't need them, I felt like I was going all right"".  Do you recall saying that to Dr Adams?A.  I think so, yeah, I think - I can't really remember if I did but I think I did at the time I was like I said before, I was taking my medication and I got better and I think there's no need for me to take it no more.
Q.  You weren't taking your medication at the time of these offences were you?A.  Yes that's right.
Q.  In fact you self-medicate don't you?A.  No I don't, no.
Q.  Do your doctors tell you to stop taking the medication, or do you make the decision to stop taking the medication?A.  The doctors, I'd speak to doctors before I'd stop taking the medication.
Q.  So you stop taking medication on the advice of your doctors, is that the case?A.   On advice of a doctor I stopped taking it.
Q.  At the time of these offences when you weren't on your medication - A.  Yes, yes.
Q.  Had a doctor told you to stop taking your medication?A.  Yes.
Q.  Which doctor was that?A.  Dr Pokovic or something, yeah it was only doctor I seen.
Q.  Is that a GP or psychiatrist?A.  Psychiatrist.
Q.  So a psychiatrist told you to stop taking your medication?A.  Yeah.
...
Q.  Did he tell you why you should stop taking your medication?A.  Not necessarily he just said that I reckon, yeah, if you want to try to stop your medication we'll give you a go, you're not taking medication, we'll give a trial of you not taking any medication.""  (T.11.1 - .49)
53In chief, the applicant had referred to a GP and psychologist having told him to go off his medication.
54Given the applicant's history, as comprehensively set out by Doctors Elliott and Adams, including his four volumes of JusticeHealth medical files described by Dr Elliott, the likelihood of a psychiatrist advising him to cease taking his anti-psychotic medication is highly improbable.  The explanation initially proffered by the applicant to the effect that he felt better and thought that there was no longer any need for him to take his medication is more likely.  It is not appropriate to develop that issue any further since his Honour did not make any specific finding in relation to it.  However, for the reasons indicated, I am not prepared to accept the applicant's submission that he bore no responsibility for ceasing his medication because he did so on medical advice.  That was an issue in the sentencing proceedings and it was challenged by the Crown.  It is unfortunate that his Honour made no specific finding in relation to it.
55What does seem clear from the applicant's evidence is that he was well aware, even with his disordered state of mind, that when he consumed alcohol he did so to excess and that unfortunate consequences often resulted.  In that regard, his Honour made a specific finding, not only that the applicant's mental illness played a role in his offending, but also that his intoxication was equally relevant.  That was a finding well open to his Honour on the evidence.
56The relevant principles are set out in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 205 A Crim R 1 where McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Simpson J and Barr AJ agreed) said:""177 Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing: see, eg, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Tsiarias [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40] - [48]; Lauritsen v R [2000] WASCA 203; (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [43] - [51]; R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35] - [45]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] - [36]; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32]; Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [14] - [18]; and R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]. They can be summarised in the following manner: 
● Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]; Miller v R [1999] WASCA 66 at [23]; R v Jiminez [1999] WASCA 7 at [23], [25]; Tsiaras at 400; Lauritsen at [51]; Israil at [23]; R v Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]; Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28].
● It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed: Engert at 71; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50 - 51; Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]; Henry at [28].
● It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced: Tsiaris at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]; Henry at [28].
● It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence: Courtney at [14]; Tsiaras at 400; Israil at [25]; JW at [192].
● Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence: Israil at [24]; Henry at [28]. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public: R v Lawrence (2005) NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23] - [24].""
57All of those considerations were specifically adverted to by the sentencing judge as were the relevant facts (except the cessation of medication).   Having done so, his Honour expressed the conclusion set out at [38] hereof.  While other judges may have reached a different conclusion, or have given a different emphasis to the particular pieces of evidence in this case, that is not the relevant test.  
58In Lowndes v R [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671 - 672 the Court said:
""15 The principles according to which an appellate court may interfere with such a discretionary judgment by a sentencing judge are well established. In their application to a Crown appeal against sentence they were summarised in R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 and R v Clarke (1996) 2 VR 520. Of particular importance in the present case is the principle that a court of criminal appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion. This is basic House v The King (1936) HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. The discretion which the law commits to sentencing judges is of vital importance in the administration of our system of criminal justice.""
59In Everett v R [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 306 McHugh J said:
""Defining the limits of the range of appropriate sentences with respect to a particular offence is a difficult task. What is the range in a particular case is a question on which reasonable minds may differ. It is only when a Court of Criminal Appeal is convinced that the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range that it is ever justified in granting leave to the Crown to appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence.""  
60This Court (Gleeson CJ, Hunt CJ at CL and McInerney J) in R v Allpass [1993] 72 A Crim R 561 said:
""An appellate court will only interfere if it is demonstrated that the sentencing judge fell into material error of law or fact. Such error may appear in the reasons given by the sentencing judge, or the sentence itself may be manifestly excessive or inadequate, and thus disclose error. However, the facts and circumstances of individual cases are often such that sentencing judges have a substantial discretion, and the appellate court does not intervene simply upon the basis that the members of that court would have exercised their discretion differently from the judge at first instance.""
61While those statements of principle were given in cases involving Crown appeals, they are not restricted to appeals of that kind but are of general application.  One needs to approach the sentencing task by reference to the facts found by the sentencing judge and his application of principle.  The only error identified was that his Honour had not made a finding as to moral culpability in circumstances where such a finding should have been made, and if it had been made, would have significantly favoured the applicant.  For the reasons set out above, the basis for that submission by the applicant has not been made out.  Accordingly, the application of the relevant principles and the evaluation of all of the evidence was a matter for the sentencing judge.  Error has not otherwise been identified.
62It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2:  The learned sentencing judge erred in treating the vulnerability arising from the victim's cognitive impairment as an aggravating feature.
63The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in taking into account as an aggravating factor an element of the offence.  The applicant relied on his Honour's observation that ""here the objective seriousness of the offence lies substantially in the vulnerability of the victim, taking into account her impairment and her vulnerability in the situation she found herself in"".  The applicant submitted that by approaching the matter in that way, his Honour was treating an element of the offence, i.e. that the victim was a person with a cognitive impairment, as a matter of aggravation.
64The applicant relied upon R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 at [32] where Howie J (with whom Bell and Hislop JJ agreed) said:
""32 It seems to me patently obvious that his Honour considered that the vulnerability of the victim was an aggravating factor within the terms of s 21A: why else would his Honour mention it when considering whether aggravating or mitigating factors within s 21A were present? In that his Honour took that factor into account as an aggravating feature, he was clearly in breach of the section, because it was an element of the offence charged. Such an error would normally indicate that the sentencing exercise miscarried. But, as I have already indicated, the sentence verged on the inadequate and there was in fact no miscarriage as no lesser sentence is warranted.""
65The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge, while not specifically describing the vulnerability of the victim arising out of her cognitive impairment as an aggravating factor, clearly took it into account as such when assessing the objective seriousness of the offending.  In doing so, the applicant submitted, his Honour fell into error.
Consideration
66While there is some ambiguity in the way in which his Honour expressed himself, it is not clear that his Honour erred in the way submitted by the applicant.  The impugned observation was part of a larger analysis of the objective seriousness of the offence (see [28] hereof).  In particular, his Honour was considering ""the range of objective seriousness for the aggravated form of the offence"".  His Honour went on to say:
""... As the circumstances in each case will be different, the individual case is best assessed by understanding what it is the offender did.""
67What his Honour was focusing upon was not the fact that the victim was a person with a cognitive impairment, but her vulnerability in the situation in which she found herself, i.e. in a railway carriage being assaulted in public while unsuccessfully trying to escape the attentions of the applicant without anyone coming to her assistance.  His Honour's focus was upon the actions of the applicant, not upon the victim's disability.
68It follows that I am not satisfied that his Honour fell into the error identified and accordingly, this ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 3:  The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
69The applicant submitted that when one took into account the discount for the plea of guilty of 25 percent, the starting point for the sentence was high, i.e. 8 years.  While the offending was obviously serious, the applicant submitted that the nature of the sexual assault was relevant and it was towards the bottom of the range of seriousness for offences of this kind.  This was notwithstanding the findings by the sentencing judge that the act was violent, degrading and humiliating.
70The applicant drew the Court's attention to the following factors:
(a) Lack of planning.(b) Reduced moral culpability of the applicant.(c) Short duration of the offence.(d) The nature of the act.
The applicant submitted that when those matters were taken into account, the sentence was manifestly excessive.
Consideration
71The applicant accepted as correct the statement of principle in Papworth v R [2011] NSWCCA 253 at [53] - [55] (Hoeben J with whom Whealy JA and Simpson agreed):
""53 The relevant test in relation to ""manifest excess"" was restated in R v Hayek [2010] NSWCCA 139:
""37 ... the task is not for this Court to decide whether it would have exercised its discretion differently. The applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"": Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33], citing Dinsdale (2002) 202 CLR 321 at 325; endorsed in Stewart v R [2009] NSWCCA 152 at [16] - [17].""
54 While consistency in sentencing is an important consideration and a desirable goal, this Court has repeatedly endorsed the principle in R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 that the relevant question on appeal is whether the sentences are within a proper range. It is not a question of whether other sentences can be said to be more or less lenient by undertaking a detailed analysis of other decided cases, as these often possess wide and divergent differences in their objective and subjective circumstances to which the sentencing judge may have attached particular weight.
55 In Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 the plurality reiterated at [54] - [55] the limited value of statistics and previously decided cases in the sentencing process. They concluded: 

""59  As was said in Dinsdale v The Queen , ""[m]anifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion"". And, as the plurality pointed out in Wong, appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate ""is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases"".  Rather, as the plurality went on to say in Wong, ""[i]ntervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons"". But, by its very nature, that is a conclusion that does not admit of lengthy exposition. And, in the present matters, the Court of Criminal Appeal, having described the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of the offenders, said that ""the sentence imposed in these matters is so far outside the range of sentences available that there must have been error"".""
72It follows that to make out this ground, the applicant must satisfy the Court that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370 - 371, Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 579 at [8] - [9].)  The focus of the applicant's submission is the starting point of the sentence before the 25 percent discount.  Such an approach deflects attention from the proper question (Graham v R [2009] NSWCCA 212 at [4], Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49).  The question for this Court is whether the sentence actually imposed was unreasonable.
73When considering the sentence it also needs to be kept in mind that there was a Form 1 offence. While the offence on the Form 1 was part of the same sequence of events, which included the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced, it remains a matter which would increase the sentence having regard to the purpose of the Form 1 process.  
74His Honour set out in detail the actions of the applicant which constituted the offence.  They involved the public assault and degradation of the complainant on a train over a period of time, including the restraint of the complainant when she tried to escape.  The applicant's mental illness was an important consideration which was extensively analysed by his Honour and taken into account by him.  The maximum sentence for the aggravated form of this offence makes it clear how seriously the community regards such an offence.  Taking all those matters into account, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
75This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Conclusion
76The orders which I propose are:
(1) Leave to appeal is granted.(2) The appeal is dismissed.
77SLATTERY J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
78BELLEW J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2761240,"AKKAWI, Mark v R; AKKAWI, Paul v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 72","Judgment

1THE COURT: On 17 February 2012, reasons for judgment on appeal (hereinafter, ""the reasons for judgment of 17 February"") and judgment of the Court issued. The published document, at that stage, contained a discrepancy as between the orders proposed in the reasons for judgment and the orders proposed on the coversheet. 

2By Notice of Motion filed 4 February 2013, the applicants, Mark and Paul Akkawi, sought orders the effect of which was that the orders recorded on the coversheet and initially entered on JusticeLink be confirmed. 

3It is necessary to describe briefly that which occurred in relation to the orders. 

Facts

4It is unnecessary to recite the circumstances of the criminal conduct of either of the applicants on the motion. The reasons for judgment of 17 February describe the conduct fully. 

5The applicants' appeals were listed for hearing and heard on 29 November 2011 before the Court, as presently constituted. The judgment of the Court was handed down by a differently constituted Court. 

6The body of the reasons for judgment of Simpson J, (with which Blanch and Rothman JJ agreed) at [100] recorded that Mark Akkawi in respect of Count 1 be sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years and 6 months commencing 29 May 2008, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months concluding on 28 August 2011. On that Count, the coversheet records that Mark Akkawi be sentenced to 5 years and 6 months commencing 29 May 2008, with a non-parole period of 4 years to expire on 28 May 2012. 

7In the same paragraph (namely [100]) the sentence in respect to Count 2 (including consideration of the Form 1 matters) is that Mark Akkawi be sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years commencing on 29 May 2009, with a non-parole period of 4 years to expire on 28 May 2013. The coversheet records that Mark Akkawi, with respect to that Count, be sentenced to 6 years and 3 months commencing on 29 May 2009, with a non-period of 3 years and 3 months to expire on 28 August 2012. 

8At [100] of the reasons for judgment of 17 February, Simpson J recorded that Paul Akkawi would be sentenced, in relation to Count 1, to imprisonment for 5 years and 6 months commencing on 29 May 2008, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months to expire on 28 August 2011. The coversheet records that Paul Akkawi was to be sentenced, with respect to Count 1, to a term of 5 years and 9 months, commencing on 29 May 2008, with a non-parole period of 3 years to expire on 28 May 2011. 

9There is no discrepancy between the coversheet and the reasons for judgment in relation to the sentence imposed on Paul Akkawi in relation to Count 2. 

10At [100] of the reasons for judgment of 17 February, Simpson J further recorded that Paul Akkawi be sentenced to 6 years, in respect to Count 3 (taking into account matters on the Form 1), commencing on 29 August 2011, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, concluding on 28 May 2014. The coversheet records that Paul Akkawi, for that Count, was sentenced to 6 years commencing on 29 May 2010, with a non-parole period of 4 years to expire on 28 May 2014. 

11There is a further discrepancy within the reasons for judgment of 17 February itself. At [100], Mark Akkawi is said to have been sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 7 years and 6 months, commencing 28 May 2008 and expiring 28 November 2015, with a non-parole period of 5 years expiring on 28 May 2013. The aggregate non-parole period, there stated, corresponds with the individual sentences for Counts 1 and 2, but the aggregate head sentence does not. 

12As earlier stated, judgment issued on 17 February 2012. By a letter dated 29 February 2012 (and filed on that date) the Crown applied to vary the orders issued by the Court pursuant to the terms of r 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules. 

Consideration

13Under the Criminal Appeal Rules, amended in 2007 to take account of computerised entry system, orders of the Court are taken to be entered when recorded in the Court's computerised record system (JusticeLink): Criminal Appeal Rules r 50B(2). 

14Pursuant to the provisions of Criminal Appeal Rules r 50C(2), a party may apply to set aside or vary an order within 14 days of its entry on JusticeLink and the effect of such an application is that the order is treated as if it had not been entered. The operation of Criminal Appeal Rules r 50C was the subject of comment by the Court in Alramadan v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (No. 2) [2008] NSWCCA 69, in which the Court said:

""[1] ... The judgment and orders were entered in the Registry on the same day. On 6 December 2007, that is within 14 days of the judgment being entered, the applicant wrote to the Registrar asking that the matter be relisted. This letter was treated as an application to set aside or vary the order and thus invoked the power of the Court under r 50C(2) of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW). It is convenient to set that rule out in full:

'Power to set aside or vary order
50C

(1) The Court may set aside or vary an order if an application for the setting aside or variation is made before entry of the order.

(2) If an application for the setting aside or variation of an order is made within 14 days after the order is entered, the Court may determine the matter, and (if appropriate) set aside or vary the order under subrule (1), as if the order had not been entered.

(3) Within 14 days after an order is entered, the Court may of its own motion set aside or vary the order as if the order had not been entered.

(4) The Court may not extend the time limited by subrule (2) or (3).

(5) Nothing in this rule affects any other power of the Court to aside or vary an order.'

[2] This rule commenced on 7 September 2007 and, so far as the Court is aware, its operation has not previously been considered. Neither party suggested that r 50C(2) should not be applied in accordance with its terms.

[3] As the Director noted, similar provisions were introduced into the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules (NSW) contemporaneously: see r 36.16(3A)-(3C). The Court was invited to note both the underlying reason for the rule (based upon entry of judgments in the electronic record of the Court) and the explanatory note which stated that the new rules would enable orders under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) 'to be entered, and to enable them to be set aside and varied, in ways similar to those for judgments and orders under the Civil Procedure Act 2005': see Criminal Appeal Rules (Amendment No. 1) 2007; GG No 116, 7/09/07, p 6888. This invitation need not be accepted for present purposes. The note is expressed in broad terms which need to be considered in the light of the remarks of Dixon J in Grierson v The Queen [1938] HCA 45; (1938) 60 CLR 431 at 436, in a passage cited with approval in Elliott v The Queen; Blessington v The Queen [2007] HCA 51; 82 ALJR 82 at [7]. In addressing the effect of the Criminal Appeal Act, Dixon J stated at p 436:

'The determination of an appeal is evidently definitive, and a conviction unappealed is equally final. No considerations controlling or affecting the conclusion to be deduced from these provisions are supplied by analogous civil proceedings.'

[4] It is sufficient for present purposes to apply r 50C(2) in its terms, so that the Court will have the same powers under the Criminal Appeal Act, taking into account relevant principles under the general law, as it has always had in relation to orders which have not been entered.""

15In our view the provisions of Criminal Appeal Rules r 50B and r 50C should be read together and the effect of r 50C(2) is to render the entry on JusticeLink not an entry of the order if, within 14 days, application is made to vary or set aside that order. The application to vary or set aside operates nunc pro tunc so that it is as if the order had never been entered. 

16Even if the effect of r 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules were not as described immediately above and, in accordance with ordinary principle, the order reflecting the coversheet were entered, the Court still has power to reconsider an appeal to allow a variation of the orders entered in certain circumstances. 

17The power of the Court to vary an order already entered (and reasons for judgment) was considered at length by the Court in R v Glyn Morgan JONES; R v Anthony Joseph Luis HILI (No 2) [2010] NSWCCA 195 (""Jones & Hili (No 2)""). In that case the amendment was required of a statement or wording in the reasons for judgment. The Court there discussed the status of the Supreme Court when exercising the jurisdiction confirmed by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. After analysis of the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal deriving from its status, it was held that the Court of Criminal Appeal is the Supreme Court for the purposes of exercising the jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeal Act and a superior court of record. 

18As stated, the Court, in Jones & Hili (No 2), there dealt with the power to correct a judgment in circumstances where, in those proceedings, the correction was to be effected to the reasons for judgment. The Court said:

""[27] Reasons for judgment are not the judgment of the Court. The foregoing is trite. 

[28] The judgment of a court is entered and forms part of the record of the proceedings and, at common law and absent statutory expansion, forms the basis for certain prerogative writs: see Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58; (1995) 184 CLR 163.

[29] Reasons for judgment do not ordinarily form part of the record of the court: Craig, supra; but, for the purpose of the issue of orders in the nature of certiorari, s 69 of the Supreme Court Act now renders reasons for judgment part of the record.

[30] At least in part, for that reason, or derived in part from the principles that give rise to that reason, significant restrictions are imposed upon the jurisdiction of a superior court to alter judgments, once entered. 

[31] As stated in Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; (1938) 60 CLR 431 at 436, Dixon J commented:

'The determination of an appeal is evidently definitive, and a conviction unappealed is equally final. No considerations controlling or affecting the conclusion to be deduced from these provisions are supplied by analogous civil proceedings.'

His Honour was there referring to the effect of the Act. 

[32] Likewise in the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 300, their Honours said:

'If a final order was made perfecting the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on Postiglione's first application, the assumption of jurisdiction to entertain his second application and the ensuing appeal was contrary to the decision of this Court in Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; (1938) 60 CLR 431. It was held in that case that the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) does not confer jurisdiction to reopen an appeal which has been heard on the merits and finally determined. A fortiori, in a case where what is involved is the hearing of a second appeal. Pantorno does not suggest otherwise. The view was expressed in Pantorno that an intermediate court of appeal can entertain an application to remedy a denial of procedural fairness whether or not its order has been perfected (Pantorno v The Queen [1989] HCA 18; (1989) 166 CLR 466 at 474 per Mason CJ and Brennan J, 484 per Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ.)'

The foregoing approach was also adopted or accepted by McHugh J (at 315) and by Gummow J (at 327) in Postiglione, supra. 

[33] Thus, there are two quite distinct periods, each of which determines the ability to alter judgments or orders. Prior to the judgment being entered, the circumstances in which a court will be persuaded to entertain further argument (and possibly further evidence) are extremely limited. In relation to such earlier period, the High Court, in Elliott & Blessington applied the civil criteria expressed by the Court in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6; (1993) 176 CLR 300 which said, at 303:

'What must emerge, in order to enliven the exercise of the jurisdiction, is that the Court has apparently proceeded according to some misapprehension of the facts or the relevant law and that this misapprehension cannot be attributed solely to the neglect or default of the party seeking the rehearing. The purpose of the jurisdiction is not to provide a backdoor method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to re-argue their cases.'

[34] On the other hand, after judgment has been entered there are only three bases upon which a judgment or order may be reopened and amended and they are:

(a) the 'slip' rule;

(b) the power to amend the rule (sic - order) where the intention of the Court has not manifested in the judgment; and

(c) the capacity to allow the opening of orders made in chambers: see Bailey v Marinoff [1971] HCA 49; (1971) 125 CLR 529; DJL, supra, CH Giles & Co v Morris (1972) 1 All ER 1960.""

19In Jones & Hili (No 2), the Court went on to hold that it had the power, in the circumstances outlined above, to alter the judgment that had been entered and had the power, in similar circumstances, with some slightly greater flexibility, to alter the reasons for judgment. 

20In the circumstances of this case, it is open to the Court to alter the reasons for judgment (at [100]) or the order that was entered reflecting the coversheet, if that alteration were effected on one of the three bases described in [34] of Jones & Hili (No 2). 

21It is necessary first to state that the process by which, in this case, the judgment issued is not an unusual one. Other procedures sometimes occur. 

22Nevertheless, in this case, the draft reasons for judgment of Simpson J were circulated to the other members of the Court for comment or agreement. Agreement was reached, as is obvious from the reasons for judgment. The agreement of the other two members of the Court is an agreement to the orders proposed in the draft reasons for judgment, in this case, of Simpson J. 

23The process by which the draft reasons for judgment and the orders proposed therein are reflected in the coversheet and subsequently entered on JusticeLink is a clerical process which, in the days of computers, ordinarily takes the form of ""a cut and paste"". For reasons which are unknown and unfathomable, in this case error occurred in this process, resulting in the discrepancies noted above. 

24Whatever be the reason for that, whether it be that the orders were retyped and mistakes made, or whether a template for orders was used and not wholly corrected, is unclear. It matters not. The intention of the Court, being the orders proposed by Simpson J to which Blanch and Rothman JJ agreed, were the orders proposed at [100] of the reasons for judgment of Simpson J, subject to the correct calculation of the aggregate head sentence for Mark Akkawi. 

25As a consequence, ""the intention of the Court has not manifested in the judgment"": see Jones & Hili (No 2) at [34(b)], recited above. Further, the aggregate head sentence for Mark Akkawi was a miscalculation of the sentences imposed. 

26The order first entered was corrected, which correction was communicated to the appellants' advisers. That error was corrected on 24 August 2012 by an Amended Notification of the Court's determination. The reasons for that correction are contained herein. 

Conclusion

27The Court well appreciates the effect that the alteration to the orders made would have had on one or both of the appellants. Nevertheless, there was an obvious inconsistency between the orders proposed in the reasons of Simpson J, to which the other members of the Court agreed, and the orders that were initially entered. Further, the orders, proposed by Simpson J and ultimately effected in the correction, substantially reduced the sentence imposed at first instance on each of the appellants. 

28The Court makes it clear that its intention was to effect the orders proposed in [100] of the reasons for judgment, with a correct calculation of the aggregate head sentence for Mark Akkawi, and the order now entered on JusticeLink reflects that intention. 

29The Court makes the following orders:

(1) Leave to appeal granted;

(2) Sentences imposed on Mark Akkawi and Paul Akkawi by the District Court on 3 September 2010 be set aside and the applicants be re-sentenced as follows:

Mark Akkawi:

Count 1: imprisonment for 5 years and 6 months, commencing on 29 May 2008 and expiring on 28 November 2013, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months, expiring on 28 August 2011.

Count 2: (taking into account the Form 1 offences) imprisonment for 6 years, commencing on 29 May 2009 and expiring on 28 May 2015, with a non-parole period of 4 years, expiring on 28 May 2013.

The aggregate sentence for Mark Akkawi is imprisonment of 7 years, commencing on 29 May 2008 and expiring on 28 May 2015, with a non-parole period of 5 years, expiring on 28 May 2013.

Paul Akkawi:

Count 1: imprisonment for 5 years and 6 months, commencing on 29 May 2008 and expiring on 28 November 2013, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months, expiring on 28 August 2011.

Count 2: imprisonment for 6 years, commencing on 29 May 2009 and expiring on 28 May 2015, with a non-parole period of 4 years, expiring on 28 May 2013.

Count 3: (taking into account the Form 1 offences) imprisonment for 6 years, commencing on 29 August 2011 and expiring on 28 August 2017, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, expiring on 28 May 2014.

The aggregate sentence for Paul Akkawi is imprisonment of 9 years and 3 months, commencing on 29 May 2008 and expiring on 28 August 2017, with a non-parole period of 6 years, expiring on 28 May 2014.

2761247,Buksh v R [2013] NSWCCA 60,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:    I agree with Campbell J.
2HALL J: I agree with Campbell J. 
3CAMPBELL J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence passed on him in the District Court of New South Wales on 30th August 2011 by his Honour Judge Keleman SC for three counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. When dealing with the third count, his Honour, at the applicant's request, took into account two other offences of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. The offences all occurred on 17th October 2010 and involved the same victim, a young woman then nineteen years of age, previously unknown to the applicant.
4The total effective sentence imposed was one of twelve years imprisonment with an effective non-parole period of eight years structured as follows:
(a)For the first count, a non-parole period of six years imprisonment commencing on 21st October 2010 and expiring on 20th October 2016 with an additional term of three years commencing on 21st October 2016 and expiring on 20th October 2019;
(b)For the second count, a non-parole period of six years commencing on 21st October 2011 with an additional term of three years commencing on 21st October 2017 and expiring on 20th October 2020; 
(c)For the third count (taking into account the Form 1 offences) a non-parole period of six years commencing on 21st October 2012 and expiring on 20th October 2018 with an additional term of four years commencing on 21st October 2018 and expiring on 20th October 2022.
The earliest date on which the applicant is eligible to be released on parole is 20th October 2018.
5The sole ground of appeal proposed is an error of principle in that, so it is said, his Honour erred in sentencing the applicant for these standard non-parole period offences in accordance with the two-stage process discussed in R. v. Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168, overruled by Muldrock v. The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. Given the focused nature of the appellant's argument, it is sufficient if I state the facts, matters and circumstances relevant to sentencing in summary form by reference to the findings made by the primary judge.
Circumstances of the offending
6On any view of the facts, the crimes of which the applicant was convicted upon his plea of guilty were objectively serious. The victim, as I have said, a young woman of nineteen years of age, who resided in Sydney's greater western region, accompanied a group of girlfriends to the city of Sydney for what might be described as a ""girls day out"". The party, including the victim, ""consumed a number of alcoholic beverages"". The group returned to Parramatta railway station between 3 and 4 p.m. before travelling to a house in Northmead where they continued to drink. The victim and one girlfriend then went to the Hotel Parramatta at about 7 p.m. to meet the girlfriend's boyfriend. More alcohol was there consumed and the victim by then was feeling ""pretty drunk"". She expressed the desire to go home but her girlfriend prevailed upon her to stay, promising to see her home in a taxi later.
7At about 9 p.m. the victim and her now two companions walked to Parramatta station with the intention of taking a train to Blacktown. By chance, the applicant was standing outside the railway station. The victim approached him and asked for a cigarette, which he supplied. He followed the group onto the platform and onto the Blacktown train. On the train he engaged them in conversation. They alighted at Blacktown and the offender went with them. They were refused entry to the Blacktown Workers' Club because of the doorman's assessment of the victim's level of intoxication, but were admitted to a nearby nightclub. There, it is fair to say, the applicant plied the victim and her girlfriend with further strong alcoholic drinks. An hour later the group left the nightclub to take a taxi from a nearby rank to return the victim to her boyfriend's house. She was very drunk and had trouble standing. The applicant helped her to walk to the taxi rank.  
8At the rank a number of taxis refused to pick the victim up because of her state of intoxication. Eventually a taxi driver obliged. The victim's friends helped her into the taxi. The applicant took the opportunity of getting into the back seat with her, informing her friends that he would see her home safely and pay for the taxi. This the applicant did not do. Instead he directed the taxi driver to his own place in Parramatta.
9The victim was in something of a stupor, but once, when the taxi stopped at traffic lights, she tried to escape. However, she stumbled and fell onto the roadway beside the taxi. The applicant picked her up and put her back in the cab. At his place he paid the fare and got the victim out of the cab.
10The offender then led the victim into his apartment block.
11It was agreed for the purpose of sentence that ""CCTV footage obtained from the apartment block depicts [the applicant] leading the victim into the building and towards the lifts. The victim is virtually paralytic and can't walk, the offender is seen to be forcibly leading her towards the lifts"".
12A witness, who had been visiting family in the building, on her way out, saw the victim on the lobby floor with the applicant standing over her. She adjudged the victim to be drunk and only semi-conscious. She inquired after the victim's wellbeing, but the applicant reassured her. The witness said that the victim had said ""can you help me?"" several times.
13The CCTV footage ""clearly depicts the victim attempting to prevent herself from being dragged into the lift, [the applicant] forcibly pulling her by the arms into the lift"".
14It was agreed that because of the victim's advanced state of intoxication she did not have complete recall of all that occurred. She had no recollection from getting out of the taxi to entry into the applicant's apartment. Her first memory is of lying on a tiled floor with blood smeared on the tiles, trying to get away from the offender. The offender hit her splitting open her lip.
15By his plea of guilty, the applicant admitted to the following offences:
(1)On the first count, sexual intercourse without consent consisting of digital penetration of the victim's vagina. The applicant admitted to penetration with two fingers causing injury to the victim. This intentional infliction of actual bodily harm was the circumstance of aggravation. It was also the source of the blood the victim noticed on the tiled floor.
(2)The second count consisted of the applicant anally penetrating the victim without her consent with his penis.  Despite her protest, the applicant did not desist. The circumstance of aggravation was the deprivation of the victim's liberty by the offender.
(3)The third count consisted of the vaginal penetration with his penis without the victim's consent.  The circumstance of aggravation was deprivation of the victim's liberty by the applicant.
16The two Form 1 offences were, first, the applicant forcibly performing an act of cuninglingus on the victim, and secondly forcing her, by pulling her hair and her head towards him, to perform an act on fellatio on him. Again, the aggravating circumstance for each was the deprivation of the victim's liberty by the applicant.
17The applicant put the victim out of the apartment block at about 6 a.m. She was then clad only in one of his t-shirts and her tights. This too was depicted on the CCTV. She ran away arriving at her home in Westmead at about 6:30 a.m. She left behind not only her clothing, but also her handbag and mobile telephone. When she arrived home her father who opened the door for her, saw that she was injured, upset and disorientated. She blurted out a narrative of what had befallen her. Her parents called the police who attended the home and took the victim to Westmead Hospital for treatment and a sexual assault examination.  


Other aggravating factors relevant to sentencing
18Quite apart from the element of aggravation forming part of each offence, there were a number other aggravating factors relevant to sentencing.  The victim was vulnerable by reason of her degree of intoxication which must have been obvious to the applicant notwithstanding his own level of intoxication. The victim's youth also made her vulnerable. The criminal activity was planned, even if only spontaneously following their chance meeting at Parramatta station. The applicant followed the victim onto the train; engaged her in conversation; followed her to another bar; plied her with alcohol; took his opportunity to deprive her of her liberty by directing the taxi driver to drive to his home, not hers; captured the victim when she tried to escape; and forced her into the lift to access his home when she tried to resist.
19The sexual assault caused injury to the victim's vagina involving bleeding from the left lateral wall which lasted a number of days and necessitated the victim's hospitalisation. She also suffered soft tissue injuries to her head and neck area, chest and back area, and upper and lower limbs.  She suffered psychological injury necessitating the prescription of antidepressants and counselling. Moreover, she feels ashamed, violated and embarrassed.
20As I have recounted, at least to some extent a prelude to the offence involved the applicant causing the victim to take and be affected by alcohol.
The applicant's subjective case
21When first questioned by police the applicant asserted that the sexual intercourse between him and the victim was consensual and, indeed, initiated by the victim; but he pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity before the Local Court.
22The applicant was nearly 36 years of age at the time he was sentenced and had been in custody in respect of this matter since 21st October 2010.  He does not have a record of any previous convictions, other than in respect of driving matters, some of which are significant, including two mid-range drink driving offences, and two driving whilst disqualified offences. The primary judge considered, therefore, that he was not disentitled to leniency. 
23Generally speaking, he seems to have been a person of good character. After leaving school he completed a TAFE Associate Diploma in Accounting, and a Bachelor of Nursing Degree at the University of Western Sydney, being admitted to the nursing profession as a registered nurse.  He performed well in his profession. At the time of his arrest in October 2010, he had held responsible positions at various nursing homes including as Director of Nursing, and Clinical Manager.  His Honour considered the applicant's offending will result in him being deregistered thereby preventing him from continuing his chosen career. The primary judge, as he was entitled to do, took this into account as an extra-curial punishment:  R. v. Lancaster (1991) 58 A Crim R 290; Application by the Attorney General [2004] NSWCCA 303; 61 NSWLR 305 at 333 [114] - [115].
24His Honour had before him a pre-sentence report, including an actuarial recidivism risk assessment, and a psychiatric report of Dr. Bruce Westmore. On the basis of this evidence, his Honour found that the applicant was not likely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation, provided he curbed his drinking. He does not have an anti-social personality disorder. He has good insight into the effect of his offending on the victim and upon his own extended family. The recidivism assessment placed the applicant in the moderate to low risk category compared to other male sex offenders. Correctional officers considered him to be quiet and compliant. The evidence suggested that he was suitable for, and would benefit from, a medium to high level of supervision from the probation and parole service on his eventual release on parole.  
25It is convenient to interpolate here that this Court received an affidavit from the applicant against the contingency that it was necessary to re-sentence him.  It is apparent from it that since he was sentenced he has attended to his rehabilitation and re-education. Because of the nature of his offence, he has been ""put into protection"" and transferred to Junee. This makes it more difficult for his family and girlfriend to visit him. From these circumstances, one might infer that incarceration is harder on the applicant than on the some others.
26The reference to the need for the applicant to curb his drinking follows from the consideration that he had reported to the psychiatrist that drinking, particularly, binge drinking on the weekend, was a feature of his lifestyle since the breakdown of his marriage at age 33.  Alcohol abuse was part of the psychiatrist's diagnosis together with adjustment disorder with depressed and at times anxious mood.  The primary judge found this latter condition was reactive to the applicant's present circumstances.  His Honour considered that the alcohol consumption whilst not a mitigating factor ""does explain why the present offences came to be committed"".
27His Honour seemed to accept as sincere the expressions of remorse contained in Exhibit 2, a letter written by the applicant on 30th August 2011.  
Reasons for sentence
28His Honour found ""the present offences are objectively serious"". He acknowledged the importance of ""general deterrence and punishment"", and to some extent ""personal deterrence"", for offences of this type. He thought that last consideration of lesser significance, doubtless, because of the findings he had made in relation to the low risk of re-offending and good prospects of rehabilitation. The primary judge found, no doubt having considered the other options, that in the light of the seriousness of the offending ""there is no option but to impose substantial full time custodial sentences"". His Honour indicated that he would allow a 25 per cent discount on the sentences that would otherwise have been imposed for the utilitarian value of the guilty pleas.
29His Honour also found a need to partially accumulate the sentences he had in mind for each offence to reflect the totality of the criminality of the offending. And he found special circumstances based upon a range of considerations including: that this was the applicant's first custodial sentence; the benefit the applicant will receive from the extended period of supervision; and the need for partial accumulation of the sentences.
30In dealing with the requirements of Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), his Honour said:
In relation to the present offences, the legislation provides for a standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment.  This applies for an offence falling within the mid-range of objective seriousness for such an offence following conviction at trial.  Following a plea of not guilty the standard non-parole period is nevertheless a reference point for sentencing purposes... I am satisfied from the agreed facts that while each of the three offences involve different forms of penetration and the acts of vaginal and anal penetration involved unprotected sex, they each fall within the middle range of objective seriousness for such offences.
After passing sentence as I have indicated at [4] above, his Honour said:
For each offence the standard non-parole period has not been imposed having regard to the offender's earlier plea of guilty, the subjective circumstances and a finding of special circumstances.
The submissions of the parties
31Mr. H.K. Dhanji SC, who appeared for the applicant, pointed out that at the time the applicant was sentenced, the correct approach for the primary judge to follow for Pt 4 Div 1A offences was taken to have been determined by the dictates of Way at [117] - [118]. It was submitted that his Honour's adherence to that two-stage approach was obvious by reference to the two passages I have set-out in the immediately preceding paragraph. It was submitted that it is clear that his Honour classified each offence as falling ""within the middle of the middle range of objective seriousness for such offences"". This was stage one. The applicant submitted that His Honour then undertook stage two by expressing specific reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period.
32Mr. Dhanji reminded the Court that the High Court of Australia in Muldrock had disapproved of this approach at 132 [28], and to that extent Way had been overruled. Not only was the ""two-stage approach to the sentencing of the offenders"" disapproved of but there is no ""need to classify the objective seriousness of the offending"" (Muldrock at 132 [29]).  This means there is no need to classify the subject offending by express reference to ""the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with a hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by enquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period"": Muldrock 132 [28].  Naturally, giving content to s.54B(2) and (3) requires an assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence which is to be undertaken ""without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders"": Muldrock 132 [27].
33Mr. Dhanji argued that the required instinctive synthesis had been overborne in the present case by the consideration of the standard non-parole period and adherence to the two-stage approach then required by R. v. Way.  Learned senior counsel argued that the outcome ""was affected by [a] type of distortion"".  As required by Muldrock (131 [26]), the primary judge should have approached the sentencing task by reference to the approach described by McHugh J in Markarian v. The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 379 [51].
34Mr. Dhanji argued that the applicant's strong subjective case had been overborne by his Honour's understandable error of principle. The assessment of the strong subjective case as part of the process of fully identifying the facts, matters and circumstances which bear upon a judgment about the appropriate sentence to be imposed, compelled the conclusion that a lesser sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed.
35Learned counsel for the Crown referred to the judgment of Davies J in Butler v. R. [2012] NSWCCA 23 at [26] (Whealy JA and Rothman J agreeing). On his Honour's analysis, in the ordinary case, error might be shown when a sentencing judge has adopted the approach of commencing with a standard non-parole period and then seeking to find factors which could ""justify a variation from it"". Generally there will be no error if the sentencing judge refers to the standard non-parole period ""simply as a guideline or yardstick"".  The consideration that the primary judge referred to the standard non-parole period as a ""reference point for sentencing purposes"" demonstrated that his Honour's approach to the present case was permissible.  Demonstrating that his Honour had otherwise followed ""the dictates of Way"" is not sufficient to demonstrate appellable error.  
36The Crown argued that on the fair reading of the reasons for sentence as a whole, his Honour had in fact demonstrated adherence to the proper Markarian approach which was not undermined by either classifying the objective seriousness of the offending ""within the middle of the middle range"", or the mere expression of reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period, which was, after all, a statutory requirement: s.54B(4).  
37The Crown argued that in any event having regard to the objective seriousness of the offending, the need to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence, the question of accumulation and the total criminality involved, the Court should be satisfied that no other sentence in law was warranted, the strength of the subjective case notwithstanding.
Decision
38With respect, I accept that Mr Dhanji's submissions accurately explain the effect of Muldrock. There is force in his submission that the use of the expression ""the middle of the middle range of objective seriousness for such offences"" suggests that his Honour classified the objective seriousness of the offending by ""commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with a hypothesised offence answering that description"". Moreover, the expression of reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period, following the pronouncement of the various sentences in the present case, may imply an inquiry as to whether ""there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period"":  Muldrock at [28] - [29].  
39But this impression is reduced by the consideration that as his Honour fixed nine years as a total term for each of counts 1 and 2, which were free of the Form 1 offences, his starting point must have been twelve years before discounting for the early plea.  By the application of s.44(2) of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure) Act, before the finding of special circumstances, this suggests a non-parole period of nine years, not ten, which is the standard non-parole period. There may not be much in it, but for this reason a supposed starting point of a non-parole period of nine years does not bespeak an automatic application of s.54B(2) to the finding of objective seriousness in respect of these offences.
40I accept the Crown's submission that the present case is like Butler.  When one considers his reasons as a whole, his Honour did not adopt the approach of commencing with the standard non-parole period before looking for factors which could ""justify a variation from it"".  Naturally, his Honour's reasons for sentence also must be read fairly.  Adopting this approach, I am not persuaded that error has been demonstrated.
41Reading his Honour's reasons fairly and as a whole, in my view it is clear that he was, in fact, ""mindful of two legislative guideposts:  the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period"" as required by Muldrock at 132 [27]. (See the introductory paragraph to the reasons for sentence.) His Honour's reference to these considerations should not be read as indicative of adoption of an impermissible two-stage approach to the sentencing task.
42A consideration of all the primary judge said up to the first of two paragraphs I have quoted in full at [30] above, which appears on page 17 of the reasons, demonstrates that in substance, his Honour did ""identify fully the facts, matters and circumstances which the judge [concluded bore] upon the judgment ... reached about the appropriate sentence to be imposed"", notwithstanding that this sentence preceded the decision in Muldrock.  After all, the instinctive synthesis approach was the usual approach to sentencing for all offences before the advent of the standard non-parole period provisions.  In my judgment the two impugned passages from his Honour's reasons, which demonstrate adherence to Way, viewed through the prism of Butler, as a matter of substance, do not betray appellable error.  
43I would reject the ground of appeal.  
44Against the prospect that I am in error in this conclusion, I wish to state that I am not of the opinion that some other - here lesser - sentence is warranted in law, notwithstanding what Mr. Dhanji rightly represents as the strength of the applicant's subjective case. The considerations of the objective seriousness of the offence, the need for retribution, including the consideration of the effect of the offending on the victim, denunciation and general deterrence all called for a heavy sentence. 
45As I pointed out at [26] above, his Honour laid emphasis upon the considerations of the need for general deterrence and punishment. As a unanimous court pointed out in R. v. AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [94]:
It must be stressed that all members of our society, including our young people, must be free to lawfully use the streets without fear of being subjected to either physical or sexual assault. The long term effects of the trauma invariably encountered by victims of either form of attack are well documented.
It also bears repeating as Hunt CJ at CL said in R v Hartitiainen (unreported, New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 June 1993) at 3, that non-consensual sexual intercourse is an extreme form of violence. It is a crime which must and will be denounced by the courts by the imposition of appropriate sentences. As Lee AJ (with whom Carruthers and Sully JJ agreed) said in R v Nichols (1991) 57 A Crim R 391 at 395:
""... it needs to be remembered that ... there must always be a reasonable proportion between the objective seriousness of the crime and the sentence imposed. In a serious crime, the court must show its denunciation of the crime committed. The moral outrage of the community must be taken into account.""
46Lee AJ, speaking of sentencing young offenders, went on to say: 
True it is... that the courts consistently point out the need to give young offenders a chance and to refrain from sending them to gaol or dealing heavily with them if that course can be avoided ... However, there is a point at which the seriousness of the crime committed by a man of 19, even though a young man, is of such a nature, is so great, that that principle must, in the public interest, give way. 
The applicant is not a young person, he had well and truly reached the age of maturity and full responsibility at the time of offending, but it might be thought that his previous good character, taken on it's own, might also be, in the ordinary course, a factor calling for particular leniency; likewise the consideration that he has suffered significant extra-curial punishment by the probable loss of his profession. But by parity of reasoning with the dictum of Lee AJ in Nichols, the seriousness of the crime committed by the applicant, even though a man of previous good character, ""is of such nature, is so great"" that condign punishment, ""in the public interest"", is called for.  
47Additionally, as Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) pointed out in R v Gorman [2002] NSWCCA 516; 137 A Crim R. 326 at [9]:
In the present case, the three offences had to be considered separately. There was no common element in any of the offences, in the sense that notion is explained in Pearce [v the Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 623]. To characterise the offences, therefore... as ""one episode of criminality"" [misapplies] Pearce and [fails] to have regard to the specific circumstances of each individual offence. 
(See also Sperling J at [54]; and R. v. Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66 at [67] per Simpson J).  
48As the Court pointed out in AEM at [70], the principle of totality ""requires that the effective sentence imposed upon an offender represent a proper period of incarceration for the total criminality involved"".
49Considering the sentence passed below in the light of these principles, I am not persuaded that his Honour's discretion miscarried notwithstanding the strength of the subjective case, to which, in my opinion, the primary judge gave appropriate weight.

50The orders I propose are as follows:
1. Grant leave to appeal;
2. Appeal dismissed.

		11 April 2013",2013-04-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761249,R v Schilder (No 3) [2013] NSWDC 141,"Judgment
1This is an application by the defence for a certificate under s 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967.  Before I can grant such a certificate, I must be satisfied of the matters referred to in s 3(1) of that Act.
2This matter was tried by me alone.  I delivered judgment on 23 January 2013 acquitting the accused of charges of aggravated dangerous driving causing death and aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm but convicted him of dangerous driving causing death and dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, statutory alternative counts to which the accused had pleaded guilty both in the Local Court and on arraignment.
3As I set out in [9] of my reasons, it had become my responsibility to decide whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt whether ""at the time of impact"" the accused was ""driving"" his vehicle ""at a speed that exceeded, by more than forty-five kilometres per hour, the speed applicable to that length of road"", namely seventy kilometres per hour.  As I pointed out more shortly, the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of the impact the accused was driving at a speed exceeding 115 kilometres per hour.
4Between [27] and [30] I pointed out that the Crown accepted that it was a reasonable possibility, which the Crown could not disprove, that the accused was having an epileptic seizure at the time of the collision on 12 September 2010 that led to the death of one victim and the suffering by another victim of grievous bodily harm.  The Crown could not disprove that that was what caused the manner of the accused's driving and the resultant collision. At [30] I pointed out that one question arising was, when did the epileptic seizure that the accused suffered begin?  I then considered certain evidence.  
5Commencing at [39] I said this:
""39.  The only rational inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the accused's epileptic seizure commenced at some point prior to his crossing the median strip north of the Bolong Road intersection.  That finding needs only to be made on the balance of probabilities.  It is consistent with the opinions expressed by Dr Armin, which I have already canvassed.  It is consistent with some of the earlier collisions in which the accused was involved, that of 19 February 2008 (the second) and that of 27 November 2008 (the fourth).  Agreed Fact 19 is that there is a roundabout at the intersection of the Highway and Belinda Street, to the north of the Bolong Road intersection.  There is no evidence as to whether the accused had to negotiate that roundabout.  The Crown did not seek to establish where the accused made his last delivery and his route links to the highway north of the Bolong Road intersection.  However, if the accused had negotiated that roundabout, the inference to be drawn is that the seizure commenced after he left the Belinda Street intersection and before he failed to negotiate the left-hand curve of the Highway north of the Bolong Road intersection.  There is no physical evidence of where the white Fairmont [the accused' vehicle] crossed the median strip.  I cannot exclude as a reasonable possibility the opinion expressed by Mr Jamieson that it was at the tangent point of 20º left-hand curve, shortly after a point 75 metres north of the intersection.  Indeed that seems imminently sensible to me and I am prepared to so find on the balance of probabilities.
40.  What was the speed of the accused's vehicle before he was overtaken by his epileptic seizure?  The simple answer to that question is:  I do not know, because there is no evidence on that point.  The Crown has not set out to prove what speed the accused was travelling at immediately before the epileptic seizure commenced, but rather the speed of the white Fairmont at the moment it collided with the green Falcon [the vehicle being driven by the deceased].  I do know that the accused's vehicle was travelling downhill before the Bolong Road intersection and continued to go downhill after crossing the median strip:  I again refer to the evidence of Mr Cooper quoted in [33] above.  Given the weight of the accused's vehicle (1.514 tonne) and gravity, the downhill slope, unless the accused braked, would have increased the white Fairmont's momentum, its speed.  I again point to the opinion expressed by Dr Armin that the accused may have had a tonic episode affecting his right leg which might have caused him to accelerate, his right foot depressing the accelerator pedal, or, alternatively, keeping his right foot on the accelerator pedal, his consciousness being so impaired that he did not know that he ought to have braked or stop.  
41.  This lack of evidence as to the speed of the accused's vehicle immediately prior to his suffering the epileptic seizure is, on the defence submissions, fatal to the Crown case for reasons to which I shall, in due course, turn.  I accept those submissions.  That really is sufficient to decide the current prosecution.""
6I went on, however, in a further forty-four pages of reasons, to consider what the Crown case was and whether it had established what it sought to establish.  I canvassed the relevant law commencing at [92].  The leading authority which guided me was Jiminez v R [1992] HCA 14; 173 CLR 572.  I was also assisted by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Gillett v R [2006] NSWCCA 370.  I came to the view that the Crown needed to establish what the accused's speed was not at the very moment of impact, after he had fallen into his epileptic seizure, but rather immediately prior to his epileptic seizure.  
7The Crown case as put to me today by the Crown Prosecutor was that the accused must be seen to be guilty because the consequences of his driving with his known tendency to epilepsy had the potential that he might fall into excessive speed in his state of semi-consciousness.  That, in my view, is a view of the law which is not compatible with the decisions of the High Court of Australia and the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The Crown never sought to establish what the speed of the accused was prior to his falling into his epileptic seizure which led to the dangerous driving leading to the death and the infliction of grievous bodily harm.  
8In the circumstances, it is my view that had the prosecution before the presentation of the indictment been in possession of all the evidence which was eventually presented to me, it would not have been reasonable in the circumstances to proceed with the prosecution of the accused on the aggravated dangerous driving charges.  I am also not persuaded that any act or omission of the accused contributed or may have contributed to the institution or continuation of the prosecution.  As I said earlier, the accused had at all material times indicated that he was guilty of the unaggravated offences.  That is set out in [8] of my earlier reasons for judgment.
9I accordingly grant to the defence the certificate requested, a pro-forma of which was filed in the Registry on 27 February 2013.  In making that finding I record that I have been guided by the principles enunciated by McColl JA with whom Beazley and Hodgson JJA concurred in Mordaunt v DPP [2007] NSWCA 121, in particular the principles set out by her Honour in [36] of her reasons.
HIS HONOUR:  No-one wants any further reasons do they?
PEARSALL:  No your Honour thank you.
RATCLIFFE:  No your Honour.

		16 August 2013",2013-04-11 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761253,Sleeman v Tuloch Pty Ltd t/as Palms on Oxford [2013] NSWDC 43,"Judgment

The applications before the court

1These are reasons for the orders that I have made today in relation to the following applications:

(a)The plaintiff's application for an extension of time to serve the fourth and fifth defendants;

(b)The defendants' application for summary judgment in relation to the fourth defendant;

(c)The defendants' application that these proceedings be struck out for want of prosecution;

(d)Contested issues of costs, and a further timetable for these proceedings prior to the hearing on 5 June 2013. 

2The background to these proceedings is as follows. The plaintiff's claim for damages for defamation, brought against five defendants, was set down for hearing by Elkaim SC DCJ on 1 February 2013, for three days commencing on 5 June 2013. The following pleadings had been filed prior to the hearing date being allocated:

(1)a Statement of Claim filed on 20 July 2012, amended on 20 December 2012; 

(2)a Defence to the Amended Statement of Claim, filed on 18 January 2013. 

(3)Although no Reply was filed by the plaintiff, this has now been attended to, as a Reply was filed in court on 13 March 2013.

3The Statement of Claim filed on 20 July 2012 named only three defendants, not five. These three defendants are a corporation which conducts a nightclub named ""Palms on Oxford"" in Oxford Street, Darlinghurst, its sole director, and the licensee. The matter complained of consists of words spoken, at 11.30 p.m. on 23 December 2011, by ""the Defendants' security guard/doorman"", who said to the plaintiff:

""You are way too drunk. Go and sober up somewhere else. You can't come in.""

4The imputations in their current form are as follows:

(a)The plaintiff was excessively drunk in a public place.

(b)The plaintiff was so drunk that he needed to sober up somewhere else.

(c)The plaintiff was so drunk as to warrant him not being admitted to the nightclub.

5In addition, the following imputations are pleaded to have been conveyed with the aid of certain extrinsic facts:

(a)The plaintiff is a hypocrite because he pretends to oppose drinking of alcohol when he himself consumes alcohol to such excess he becomes drunk.

(b)The plaintiff was excessively drunk in a public place.

(c)The plaintiff was so drunk that he needed to sober up somewhere else.

(d)The plaintiff was so drunk as to warrant him not being admitted to the nightclub.

6Interlocutory argument concerning imputations, vicarious liability and aggravated damages took place before Elkaim SC DCJ on 30 November 2012. No judgment is available, but his Honour made the following orders:

(1)Leave to the plaintiff to replead Particulars 4(a) and 5(a) of the Statement of claim and to replead paragraph (b) in relation to aggravated damages.

(2)The plaintiff is to file an Amended Statement of Claim giving the particulars of the basis upon which the first and second defendants are vicariously liable for the actions of the security guard.

(3)The plaintiff is to give particulars of the basis upon which the licensee is vicariously liable for the actions of the security guard unless that allegation is derived only from the third defendant's position as licensee.

(4)The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs in respect of preparation for the hearing today. In respect of the hearing today the plaintiff is to pay half the defendants' costs.

(5)The plaintiff is to file and serve the Amended Statement of Claim within 14 days.

(6)The defendants are to file and serve a Defence to the Amended Statement of Claim by 22 January 2013.

(7)Listed for further directions in the Defamation List on 1 February 2013.

7An Amended State of Claim was filed, outside the 14-day period, on 20 December 2012. This pleading went well beyond the leave granted. First of all, it was filed outside the 14-day period, namely on 20 December 2012, which was two days prior to the expiry of the limitation period. Secondly, the pleading added two new defendants, namely the security guard who spoke the words and the company for which he worked. Thirdly, these defendants, who were added without leave being sought or granted, in a pleading filed during the court vacation, were not served with this statement of claim during the one-month service period, in circumstances where any defence had to be filed by 22 January. In addition, the fourth and fifth defendants were not told that, on 1 February 2013, these proceedings were set down for hearing on 5 June 2013. 

8I then received the file, as the Trial Judge. Noting the absence of any Appearance or defence filed on behalf of the fourth and fifth defendants, I listed the hearing for case-management directions on 13 February 2013, and asked the parties to advise as to who should be contacted.

9The fifth defendant, a corporation, was served by post on 12 February 2013. The fourth defendant was not served until 4 March 2013. In both cases, the statement of claim which was served was stale (r 6.2(4)(b)(i) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR"")). The limitation period had also expired. On 13 March 2013 applications were made for an extension of time for service (on the part of the plaintiff) and for summary judgment (on behalf of the fourth defendant), on the basis that the plaintiff had stated, in other proceedings, that the fourth defendant was not the person who had uttered the words set out in the matter complained of. 

The case management orders on 13 February and 13 March 2013 

10On 13 February 2013 the matter could not proceed, as the fourth and fifth defendants were not represented. In addition, the first to third defendants complained of non-compliance with orders for the filing of a Reply and discovery. I made the following orders:

(1)Matter stood over for further directions to Wednesday 13 March 2013 at 9:00am.

(2)The plaintiff is granted an extension of 7 days to file a Reply.

(3)On Wednesday 13 March 2013, the parties are to advise as to whether any point will be taken in relation to non-service of the fourth and fifth defendants, and any argument concerning this issue is to be the subject of directions before Gibson DCJ on that day.

(4)Defendants' request for particulars concerning failure to serve the fourth and fifth defendants to be provided in 7 days; reply to be provided 14 days thereafter.

(5)The First, Second and Third Defendants agree to the use of documents in the ADT in these proceedings.

(6)Costs of today reserved.

11On 4 March 2013, an Appearance was filed in relation to the fifth defendant, and the fourth defendant was served. On 13 March 2013, when the matter was next listed for directions, the solicitor appearing for the fifth defendant advised that the Appearance filed on 4 March 2013, lodged on behalf of a potential insurer, was to be withdrawn. I was also told the plaintiff had not complied with orders in relation to the filing of a Reply, or in relation to discovery and interrogatories, and that certain particulars were outstanding. This meant that the matter was still not ready for case management. I made the following further orders:

(1)Note that the Appearance filed on behalf of the fifth defendant is withdrawn and dispense with the need to file any further documents by the fifth defendant.

(2)Extend time for the plaintiff to file the Reply to today and grant leave to the plaintiff to file the Reply in court and dispense with the need for service.

(3)The plaintiff's application for extension of time of service of the statement of claim is to be listed for argument on Friday 12 April 2013 at 9:30am.

(4)All evidence in support of the motion is to be served by Tuesday 26 March 2013 at midday.

(5)The defendants' application for summary disposal of the action against the fourth defendant is listed for hearing on Friday 12 April 2013 at 9:30am.

(6)All evidence in support of the motion is to be served by Tuesday 26 March 2013 at midday.

(7)Extend time for the plaintiff to serve his List of Documents to Tuesday 19 March 2013.

(8)Extend time for the plaintiff to serve interrogatories to Tuesday 19 March 2013.

(9)Parties to answer each other's interrogatories by Friday 5 April 2013.

(10)The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs.

12I received submissions on behalf of the defendants by the due date (26 March 2013). The plaintiff provided no submissions. In response to inquiry by the solicitors for the defendants, the solicitors for the plaintiff advised that the plaintiff was not seeking any orders of any kind in relation to the fourth and fifth defendants. The defendants then foreshadowed an application to have the whole of the proceedings struck out for want of prosecution by reason of the plaintiff's asserted repeated failure to comply with timetables and because of the unsatisfactory nature of the claims in relation to the fourth and fifth defendants.

13As the plaintiff now abandons any claim against the fourth and fifth defendants, the first issue is what orders, if any, should be made in relation to costs. The second issue is the defendants' application for summary dismissal of the whole proceedings.

Relevant legislation

14I shall first set out the relevant legislation. Section 60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) (""CPA"") provides:

""60 Proportionality of costs

In any proceedings, the practice and procedure of the court should be implemented with the object of resolving the issues between the parties in such a way that the cost to the parties is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the subject-matter in dispute.""

15Section 61 of the CPA provides:

""61 Directions as to practice and procedure generally

(1) The court may, by order, give such directions as it thinks fit (whether or not inconsistent with rules of court) for the speedy determination of the real issues between the parties to the proceedings.

(2) In particular, the court may, by order, do any one or more of the following:

(a) it may direct any party to proceedings to take specified steps in relation to the proceedings,

(b) it may direct the parties to proceedings as to the time within which specified steps in the proceedings must be completed,

(c) it may give such other directions with respect to the conduct of proceedings as it considers appropriate.

(3) If a party to whom such a direction has been given fails to comply with the direction, the court may, by order, do any one or more of the following:

(a) it may dismiss the proceedings, whether generally, in relation to a particular cause of action or in relation to the whole or part of a particular claim,

(b) it may strike out or limit any claim made by a plaintiff,

(c) it may strike out any defence filed by a defendant, and give judgment accordingly,

(d) it may strike out or amend any document filed by the party, either in whole or in part,

(e) it may strike out, disallow or reject any evidence that the party has adduced or seeks to adduce,

(f) it may direct the party to pay the whole or part of the costs of another party,

(g) it may make such other order or give such other direction as it considers appropriate.

(4) Subsection (3) does not limit any other power the court may have to take action of the kind referred to in that subsection or to take any other action that the court is empowered to take in relation to a failure to comply with a direction given by the court.""

16The provisions for leave to discontinue and for dismissal of proceedings are set out in rr 42.19 and 42.20 UCPR, which provide:

""42.19 Proceedings discontinued

(1) This rule applies to proceedings that are discontinued by the plaintiff, as referred to in rule 12.1.

(2) Unless the court orders otherwise or the notice referred to in rule 12.1 (2) otherwise provides, the plaintiff must pay such of the defendant's costs as, at the date on which the notice of discontinuance was filed, had been incurred by the defendant in relation to each claim in respect of which the proceedings have been discontinued.

(3) Despite subrule (2), the defendant's costs in an appeal to the District Court under section 91 of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 are not payable by the plaintiff unless the court finds there are special circumstances to justify an order for their payment by the plaintiff.

42.20 Dismissal of proceedings etc

(1) If the court makes an order for the dismissal of proceedings, either generally or in relation to a particular cause of action or in relation to the whole or part of any claim, then, unless the court orders otherwise, the plaintiff must pay the defendant's costs of the proceedings to the extent to which they have been dismissed.

(2) If the court makes an order striking out a defence, either generally or in relation to a particular cause of action or in relation to the whole or part of any claim, then, unless the court orders otherwise, the defendant must pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings in relation to those matters in respect of which the defence has been struck out.""

17Rule 12. 7 UCPR provides:

""12.7 Dismissal of proceedings etc for want of due despatch

(1) If a plaintiff does not prosecute the proceedings with due despatch, the court may order that the proceedings be dismissed or make such other order as the court thinks fit.

(2) If the defendant does not conduct the defence with due despatch, the court may strike out the defence, either in whole or in part, or make such other order as the court thinks fit.""

What costs orders should be made in relation to the fourth and fifth defendants?

18By letter dated 2 April 2013, the plaintiff's solicitors wrote to the defendants' solicitors as follows:

""In respect to your proposed Application to summarily dispose of and/or strike out the Plaintiff's claim against the Fourth and Fifth Defendants on 12 April 2013 we advise that there are no claims to be struck out. We endeavoured to make claims against the Fourth and Fifth Defendants but your Counsel pointed out they had not been served in time. They are therefore defunct and are of no effect and there is no application to extend time.""

19As noted earlier, the Amended State of Claim was filed on 20 December 2012. The plaintiff has one month to serve this amended pleading on the defendants. Rule 6.2(4)(b)(i) UCPR provides:

""6.2 How proceedings commenced

...

(4) Subject to subrule (5), originating process is valid for service:

(a) in the case of proceedings in the Supreme Court, the Land and Environment Court, the Dust Diseases Tribunal or the Local Court, for 6 months after the date on which it is filed, or

(b) in the case of proceedings in the District Court:

(i) except as provided by subparagraph (ii), for one month after the date on which it is filed, or

(ii) if the defendant (or at least one of the defendants) is to be served outside New South Wales, for 6 months after the date on which it is filed.

(5) Failure to serve originating process within the time limited by these rules does not prevent the plaintiff from commencing fresh proceedings by filing another originating process.""

20It would not have been easy for the plaintiff to obtain an extension: Van Leer Australia Pty Ltd v Palace Shipping KK (1981) 180 CLR 337; Weston v Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd [2011] NSWSC 433 at [183]. However, the defendants, conscious of their obligations to conduct the matter efficiently (Hoser v Hartcher [1999] NSWSC 527), indicated that they would not take this point if some kind of explanation for delay was available. 

21After the matter was stood in the list for some time this morning, counsel for the plaintiff advised that her client consented to the proceedings brought against the fourth and fifth defendants being dismissed (see order 1 below). The plaintiff's decision not to proceed with the application is both reasonable and understandable, but the failure to notify the defendants more promptly of this must have costs implications: Packer v Meagher [1984] 3 NSWLR 486.

22As Hallen AsJ explains in McNamara v Bao San [2010] NSWSC 809 at [12], UCPR r 42.20 does not give rise to a presumption that costs will be ordered against a plaintiff where proceedings are dismissed, but creates a starting point by requiring this outcome to be displaced by a discretionary decision. The plaintiff should be the moving party on an application for an alternative costs order (in the present case, that being an order that each party pay his or its own costs). It is important in such applications to draw a distinction between cases in which one party effectively surrenders to the other and cases where some supervening event occurs.

23Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the supervening event was that her client realised, in the course of other proceedings where the security guard gave evidence, that the person who had said the words was some other person. Counsel for the defendants submitted that the evidence of the fourth defendant was that he had a good recollection of these events, and that he told the plaintiff he would not be permitted to enter the nightclub because it was apparent to the fourth defendant, from the plaintiff's appearance and demeanour, that he was affected by alcohol. 

24This case is a good example of the problem identified by Hallen AsJ in McNamara v Bao San, supra, at [12](i), namely that neither category can be precisely defined.

25However, whether or not the proceedings against the fourth and fifth defendants have been abandoned, the plaintiff's legal advisers have been well aware of the problem in joining him as a party since reading the affidavit of the fourth defendant in the other court proceedings referred to. The plaintiff's delay in deciding what steps to take consequent upon the decision not to include the fourth and fifth defendants has resulted in appropriate orders not being able to be made until today. The defendants put a number of sensible proposals to the plaintiff over the past two weeks, none of which were acted upon by the plaintiff. The plaintiff elected to contest the costs consequences his inaction. For these reasons, the plaintiff should pay the costs of the fourth and fifth defendants.

26In addition to the application for summary judgment brought by the fourth defendant, all defendants brought an application for these proceedings to be struck out for want of prosecution. This was conducted at the same time as the applications in relation to the fourth and fifth defendants, and there was considerable factual overlap.

The defendants' application to strike out these proceedings for want of prosecution

27The defendants complain of a series of failures to comply with court orders in this matter by the plaintiff. These are summarised in the letter by the plaintiff's solicitor to the defendant's solicitor dated 5 April 2013 in the following nine points:

(1)The circumstances of the filing of the Amended Statement of Claim on 20 December 2012.

(2)The submissions made by counsel for the plaintiff in court on 13 February 2013. This included concessions that the failure to serve was an oversight and a suggestion (without any formal application) that the hearing be adjourned to accommodate the plaintiff's lawyers' ""oversight"".

(3)Failure to comply with the orders I made on 13 February 2013, including failure to explain the delay in serving the fourth and fifth defendants.

(4)The service of the ASOC on the fourth defendant on 4 March 2013 despite the plaintiff stating in other proceedings that the fourth defendant had not spoken the words.

(5)The submissions made by counsel for the plaintiff to the court.

(6)Failure to comply with the orders of 13 March 2013, including an order that the plaintiff file and serve his evidence in support of the application by 26 March and the fourth and fifth defendants file their evidence to summarily dispose of the proceedings by 26 March.

(7)Failure of the plaintiff to respond to the plaintiff's letter of 17 February 2013.

(8)The conduct of the plaintiff in failing to respond to correspondence of 13 March 2013 in a timely fashion.

(9)The failure of the plaintiff to comply with any of the orders made by the Court on 13 February 2013 and 13 March 2013. This complaint overlaps with grounds.In this letter, the solicitors for the defendants went on to say:

""Contrary to your assertion that there is no application to extend time for service - an application was made on the plaintiff's behalf orally on 13 March 2013. That application has been stood over for argument on 12 April 2013. As a result of the notification of that application the fourth and fifth defendants have incurred substantial costs, including the costs of preparing evidence.

If the plaintiff has changed his position and will seek to have his own motion dismissed, can you please inform us of that change of position by midday on Monday so that we do not waste further costs preparing for the application on Friday. Further, the plaintiff will need to seek leave to file a Further Amended Statement of Claim to reflect what is apparently now his position, namely that he does not pursue claims as against the fourth and fifth defendants. He will also need to seek leave to discontinue as against the fourth and fifth defendants. That leave will only be consented to if the plaintiff agrees to pay the fourth and fifth defendants' costs.""

28The defendants rely upon ss 56-62, and in particular s 56 and 61(3)(a), of the Civil Procedure Act. Counsel for the defendants draws my attention to the insightful analysis of the interaction of these provisions with the entitlement of the parties to a fair trial process which Johnson J has set out in Rivera v State of New South Wales & Anor [2012] NSWSC 1360 at [82]-[86]. 

29In Fairey v Fairey (No 2) [2000] NSWCA 173 at [51]-[58] the Court warned that dismissal of proceedings was an exceptional order, and a power not lightly to be exercised. Decisions of this kind must now be made against the framework of the Civil Procedure Act, and courts will not stand by and permit endless opportunities to a litigant to flout court orders, as Johnson J pointed out in Fleet v State of New South Wales [2009] NSWSC 75 at [12]-[15].

30However, while the Court of Appeal has described the discretion to dismiss proceedings for want of prosecution as being wider under this legislation than under the common law (Pacanowski v Wakerman [2009] NSWCA 402 at [26]-[28]), the principles enunciated by Simpson J in Hoser v Hartcher [1999] NSWSC 527, which predate the Civil Procedure Act, continue to be cited with approval (Pacanowski at [26]-[28]).

31In Hoser there was a delay of three years after defamation proceedings were commenced, during which time the plaintiff was charged with offences and imprisoned. The defendant took no steps during this time, and when the plaintiff reactivated his case, the defendant's failure to act was fatal. This failure outweighed such matters as claims of prejudice and what Simpson J considered to be the plaintiff's poor prospects of success when the matter went to trial. 

32The defendants in these proceedings have, however, conducted their case with diligence. That includes this application; the defendant provided the plaintiff with a timetable with alternative steps designed to progress these proceedings towards a hearing date. In addition, unlike Hoser, where explanations were offered by the plaintiff for his three-year delay, the plaintiff here does not proffer explanations or apologies for the failures to comply with timetables for the filing of a Reply, discovery and interrogatories, or for the circumstances in which these proceedings were set down for hearing without the fourth and fifth defendants being informed. These matters, relevant to items (3)-(7) and (9) in Simpson J's checklist in Hoser v Hartcher, are submitted to be matters of some weight.

33Counsel for the defendants also relies upon the circumstances in which these proceedings were set down for hearing without two of the defendants being informed that proceedings have even been started. There have been several recent examples of the problems this kind of conduct causes for both the parties and the court. In Kim v New Korea Herald HC [2011] NZHC 1491; Kim v Lee [2012] NZCA 19, 248, 256 and 600 the fact that one defendant was unrepresented was not discovered until after a trial where damages of $250,000 were awarded. In Flanagan v Urban Publishing Group Pty Ltd [2012] NSWDC 238 the fact that the sole defendant had not been served was not discovered until after the proceedings had been listed for trial. In the present case, the defendants were not avoiding service, or watching from the sidelines (Gate Gourmet Australia Pty Ltd (in liq) v Gate Gourmet AG [2002] NSWSC 727). 

34However, the checklist in Hoser v Hartcher relates to its particular facts, and caution should be used when applying it generally to applications such as the present. These are proceedings which were commenced promptly and set down for hearing with, if anything, almost undue speed. There is a qualitative difference between failing to take any steps at all and simple failures to comply with timetables, even where those failures are multiple or repeated. In addition, many of the problems appear to have been the result of errors by the plaintiff's legal representatives rather than the plaintiff, and the plaintiff should not be penalised: Obeid v Australian Broadcasting Corporation & Ors (Supreme Court of NSW, Levine J, 10 July 1998).

35Notwithstanding the defendants' reliance upon the checklist set out in Hoser v Hartcher, I am satisfied that the facts of this case fall far short of amounting to conduct warranting the striking out of proceedings. These are not proceedings of the ""stop writ"" variety (Obeid, at 5). Many of the failures to comply have been rectified, and there is no reason why the action should not be ready for hearing on 5 June 2013.

36While the application for summary dismissal must fail, I am satisfied that it was a step properly taken, given the plaintiff's unrealistic stance in relation to the claim against the fourth and fifth defendants, and the repeated failure to comply with timetables. For these reasons, and because this application is intertwined with the other applications before me today (in which the defendants have been entirely successful) it is appropriate that the plaintiff pay the costs of today, and that those costs should include this application.

		19 April 2013",2013-04-11 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761254,Montgomery v R [2013] NSWCCA 73,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I have had the benefit of reading the judgments of both Simpson J and Fullerton J in draft.
2With respect to ground one of the appeal I agree for the reasons given by Simpson J that it should be rejected. With respect to ground two of the appeal I agree with the reasons given by Fullerton J that it should be rejected.
3I agree with the orders proposed by Fullerton J. 
4SIMPSON J:  I have read in draft the judgment of Fullerton J.  For the reasons that follow, I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.  I wish to make my own approach to ground 1 clear.  I rely on the outline of facts contained in the draft judgment of Fullerton J.
5Ground 1 concerns cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor of a witness (Lionel Potter) called in the defence case.  Mr Potter was, in effect, an alibi witness, although he provided an alibi to the appellant in only one relatively small - but not unimportant - aspect of the Crown evidence.
6Fullerton J has set out in full the cross-examination and the circumstances in which it arose.  It plainly went only to Mr Potter's credit.  It raised Mr Potter's criminal history although identification of the dates of the convictions the subject of the questioning was avoided.  Section 103(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 permits cross-examination relevant only to credit if the evidence has substantial probative value.  Some circumstances relevant to the assessment of probative value for the purposes of s 103(1) are set out in sub-s (2).  One circumstance explicitly mentioned as relevant is the period that has elapsed since the occurrence of the acts or events to which the evidence relates (s 103(2)(b)).  It is inherent in s 103 that a court may be called upon, in advance of cross-examination, to make a ruling as to the existence or otherwise of substantial probative value in the evidence.  No ruling under s 103 was sought, and no notice was given to counsel for the appellant of the intention to cross-examine on the subject matter of Mr Potter's prior convictions.  That, in itself, was, in my opinion, a serious departure from proper standards of conduct required of a Crown prosecutor.  Had the Crown prosecutor advised defence counsel of his intention to cross-examine on that subject, defence counsel would have had the opportunity, which he undoubtedly would have taken, of raising the matter with the trial judge and obtaining a ruling on whether he would permit that cross-examination.  Such a ruling would have involved an assessment of the probative value of the evidence, particularly taking into account the dates of the convictions.  It clear from what occurred after the commencement of the cross-examination that, had that preliminary step been taken, the cross-examination would not have been permitted.  That is because, having regard to the period that had elapsed since the offences of which Mr Potter was convicted (a minimum of 50 years) the evidence could not have been held to have had substantial probative value.  Moreover, those offences of which he was (and remained) convicted were, in the scheme of things, relatively minor.  The serious offence about which Mr Potter was cross-examined - rape - should never have been put to him, since he was, after appeal, acquitted of that offence.  
7Further, as Fullerton J has pointed out, the document from which counsel was cross-examining was of dubious provenance and accuracy and not capable of supporting some of the propositions put to Mr Potter.  I am satisfied that there was unfairness in the manner in which the Crown prosecutor approached the cross-examination.  To this extent, I agree with Fullerton J.  I do not, however, agree that the cross-examination resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
8Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 states the grounds upon which this Court is to uphold an appeal against conviction.  The grounds are:
that the verdict is unreasonable;
that the verdict cannot be supported having regard to the evidence;
that there has been a wrong decision on any question of law; or
that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice.
9It not being contended that the verdict was unreasonable or unsupportable on the evidence, or that there was a wrong decision on any question of law, the only ground that has potential application is that there was otherwise a miscarriage of justice.  
10An unfair trial, even where it cannot be said that the result has been affected by the unfairness, may amount to a miscarriage of justice.  That is because an accused person is entitled to a trial according to law.  But it is not every departure from the gold standard of a trial according to law that converts an otherwise fair trial into one which is unfair.  What constitutes a miscarriage of justice for the purposes of s 6(1) (as distinct from the proviso to that sub-section) was the subject of extensive consideration in TKWJ v R [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124.  Traditionally, a miscarriage of justice has been considered to have occurred where some error or irregularity in the trial has ""deprived the accused of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open"" (Mraz v The Queen [1955] HCA 59; 93 CLR 493; TKWJ at [26], per Gaudron J).  See also the comprehensive analysis in TKWJ by McHugh J at [64] and following.  
11It is necessary closely to examine the unfairness alleged, and to do that in the context of the trial as a whole.  The appellant gave evidence on the 56th, 57th, 59th, 60th and 61st days of a four-month trial involving three accused.  Mr Potter gave evidence immediately after the conclusion of the appellant's evidence, on the 61st day.  Thereafter the co-accused Bradley Evans gave evidence over eight days, and called a number of witnesses.  Counsel addressed and the judge summed up.  The verdicts were returned on the 87th day of the trial.
12Evidence concerning the appellant's role in the conspiracy alleged was given in the Crown case by three accomplices, of whom perhaps the most important was Stephen James.  True it was that his evidence, and that of the other accomplices, was subject to a warning, in strong terms, under s 165 of the Evidence Act.  James had received a substantial reduction in his sentence by reason of his undertaking to give evidence against the accused who went to trial.  Nevertheless, he and the other accomplice witnesses were witnesses who may well have been taken to have been in a prime position to implicate their co-conspirators.  James' evidence included evidence of conversations with the appellant, about his asserted ability to have the drugs offloaded from the ship at Darling Harbour, that the appellant provided a significant sum of money by way of finance for the venture, that the appellant gave him documents bearing the names of ships operated by the shipping line, that the appellant gave James two metal cargo security seals for use in the importation, that James sent coded messages to the appellant concerning the importation, and that the appellant had met on occasions with other members of the conspiracy.  James Gray-Spence gave evidence that the appellant had asked him to assist in the distribution of the cocaine, and that, at later date, the appellant told him that the enterprise had ""gone pear shaped"".  In addition, there was surveillance evidence that showed the appellant in association with other members of the conspiracy.
13The evidence which Potter was called to rebut was of the last kind - evidence that, on the evening of 1 June 2003, at about 10.20pm, the appellant had been seen in The Rocks area by a surveillance police officer.  The evidence was not without significance to the Crown case.  1 June was the date the ship thought to be carrying the cocaine was due to dock not far from The Rocks.  The container terminal at which it was to dock could be seen from the location where the appellant was said to have been seen.  Other men, who, it could be inferred, were members of the conspiracy had earlier been seen nearby.  The location of the appellant in that vicinity at that time had undoubted capacity to give rise to an inference that he was there for the purpose of the proposed importation.
14The evidence of the appellant and Potter was that, on that day, they had together attended a football match at Kogarah, had then gone to the Coogee Bay Hotel, and then to the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club (at Kingsford) where they remained together until about 10.30pm.  The appellant said that he signed the register on entry.  Records of the Club were tendered (Ex 126).  There was no record of the appellant's attendance, nor that of Mr Potter, on 1 June.
15Although, as I have indicated, I consider the conduct of the Crown prosecutor to have been unsatisfactory, I am unable to conclude that the cross-examination (which was cut off very quickly) rendered a four-month trial (of the conduct of which there is, subject to ground 2, otherwise no complaint) unfair.  I am quite unable to conclude that the brief cross-examination caused a miscarriage of justice.
16Defence counsel made the best of an unfortunate situation by merely adducing evidence that the convictions of which the jury had heard before the cross-examination was stopped were long in the past.  No more was made of them.  In my opinion, the jury could have been under no illusion about the insignificance of Mr Potter's criminal history.  There were much weightier reasons for rejecting his evidence - the positive identification of the appellant in the relevant place at the relevant time, and the negative inferences available from the Club's records.  Although, in the circumstances of this appeal, the issue has taken on some magnitude, in my opinion that is unrealistic when it is seen in the context of the trial.  The issue was of very small moment in the overall circumstances of the trial.  That is in significant measure due to the swift and early intervention of the trial judge, as soon as he perceived the dubious nature of the document from which counsel was cross-examining.  Even if the cross-examination had not taken place, and the jury had accepted that the appellant was not in The Rocks area on the evening of 1 June, that was insufficient, in the light of the whole of the evidence in the Crown case, to create a doubt in the minds of the jury about his participation in the conspiracy.  There was, for the purposes of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, no miscarriage of justice.  It is therefore unnecessary to consider the proviso to the section.
17With respect to ground 2 of the appeal, I agree, for the reasons given by Fullerton J, that it should be rejected.
18FULLERTON J:  Ricky James Montgomery (the appellant), Bradley Evans and Hayden Rogers were charged that between 1 January 2002 and 2 July 2003 they conspired with each other and with Steven James, John Morrison, Colin Kemery and divers other persons to import a commercial quantity of cocaine into Australia contrary to s 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth).  The commercial quantity of cocaine is two kilograms.  The offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  
19On 26 November 2007, after a trial extending over four months, the jury returned verdicts of guilty for each of the accused.  The appellant was convicted and sentenced on 26 September 2008 to 18 years imprisonment commencing on 5 November 2007, with a non-parole period of 10 years and 10 months.  He appeals his conviction.  There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence.
20At the hearing of the appeal two grounds were pressed:
Ground 1:  The trial miscarried by reason of the conduct of the Crown and the nature of the unfair cross-examination of a witness, namely Lionel Potter.
Ground 2:  The trial miscarried by reason of the conduct of the Crown and the nature of the cross-examination of the appellant where an irrelevant and prejudicial association was raised, namely (with) Jai Abberton, effectively raising the bad character of the appellant.
Application for extension of time
21An appeal against conviction (and an application for leave to appeal against sentence) may be initiated by a notice of intention to appeal filed within 28 days of a conviction (or sentence) (s 10(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912).  An applicant is then afforded a period of six months within which to file a notice of appeal.  Section 10(1)(b) provides that an application seeking an extension of time to appeal may be made if the applicant is unable to comply with the timeframe.  
22The appellant filed a notice of intention to appeal on 10 November 2008 which expired on 10 May 2009.  A notice of appeal was not filed until 22 December 2010.  The appellant seeks a grant of leave to appeal out of time which the Crown opposes.  Counsel for the appellant relied upon a brief chronology of the proceedings in support of the grant of leave.
23On 30 April 2009, ten days before the notice of intention to appeal was due to expire, an application seeking an extension of the notice was filed and granted on the grounds that several days of the trial transcript had not been received and that counsel required three months to consider the trial transcript in its entirety and to advise and settle the grounds of appeal.  
24On 7 August 2009 time was further extended until 30 November 2009, an additional period of over three months.  On 16 November 2009 a further extension of time was sought on the grounds that legal aid funding for junior counsel to assist senior counsel in preparing an advice on merit had been granted on 10 November 2009 and that junior counsel required time to familiarise himself with the trial transcript.  On 21 December 2009 the appellant was informed that the Court would not grant a further extension.  
25On repeated occasions throughout 2010 the appellant apparently sought to obtain further trial transcripts and several of the trial judge's interlocutory rulings in order to fully advise as to whether the appeal had merit for legal aid funding purposes.  On 25 January 2010 the appellant's lawyers wrote to the District Court seeking further trial transcript.  Additional transcript was provided on 19 March 2010. 
26On 4 August 2010 a merit advice was furnished to the Legal Aid Commission.  On 20 September 2010 the appellant was granted legal aid to pursue an appeal.  On 22 December 2010 a notice of appeal was filed.  
27In R v Gregory [2002] NSWCCA 199 at [38] Hodgson JA (with whom Levine and Simpson JJ agreed) held that whether leave should be granted to extend time for an appeal requires that consideration be given to the interests of justice in all the circumstances, including the interests of the appellant and those of the Crown.  
28The Crown opposed the grant of leave on a number of bases.  The first was that a delay of over three years before the notice of appeal was filed obliged the appellant to satisfy the Court that the circumstances giving rise to the delay were exceptional (see Gonzales v R [2007] NSWCCA 321; 178 A Crim R 232 at [5] - [6]; Gregory at [34], [45]) and that none were identified by the appellant or obvious from the chronology of events upon which the appellant relied. 
29The appellant's submissions do not specifically identify the circumstances said to be ""exceptional"", but refer instead to decisions of this Court where it has been held that where there has been a substantial delay which has been satisfactorily explained, leave should not be refused (see R v Edwards [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [8]; R v Beattie [2000] NSWCCA 201 at [17]).  
30The appellant's counsel submitted that the delay was not the fault of the appellant, who had at all times indicated his determination to pursue his appeal, or the result of any dilatoriness on the part of the appellant's legal representatives, but because of events beyond their control, principally the sheer volume of the trial material and the difficulties they encountered in trying to assemble it.  Additional delays were encountered when the District Court endeavoured, with varying degrees of success, to locate the various interlocutory rulings referred to in the transcript.  It was submitted, without demur from the Crown, that access to the complete trial transcript was essential to accurately frame and settle grounds of appeal and submissions.  The procedures involved in obtaining a grant of aid to pursue a merit advice were also relied upon as accounting for the delay.  
31While the Crown emphasised that it was the obligation of the appellant to provide a ""satisfactory explanation"" for the delay, it did not submit that the explanation for the delay was unsatisfactory.  The Crown did emphasise however that the interests of justice generally weigh against the grant of leave where, as here, the time between the trial and the appeal has been lengthy and in particular, in this case, since the subject trial was a retrial, the difficulties the Crown would likely encounter were the appeal successful and a retrial ordered. 
32It is well recognised that where an appellant has provided a satisfactory explanation for delay in pursuing his/her statutory right to appeal, the Court will not lightly exercise its discretion to refuse leave even where the prospects of success are not immediately evident.  In R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 275 at [35] Smart AJ held that a grant of leave to extend time under s 10(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act afforded the Court a wide discretion to extend time where it is just, in the circumstances, that such an order should be made.
33A further ground relied upon by the Crown in opposing a grant of leave was that if the appeal were successful and a new trial ordered, the presentation of the Crown case at any retrial would be affected by the passage of time since the appellant's arrest in June 2003 and which concerned his conduct in a conspiracy extending over a 12 month period prior to that date. 
34While there is some force in the Crown's concern that a delay of close to ten years since the currency of the conspiracy and over five years since the second jury returned a verdict of guilty might compromise the Crown's ability to reassemble and represent its case against the appellant, the Crown did not submit that this was due to witnesses being unavailable or unwilling to give evidence.  I also note that the Crown could readily reproduce the electronic and physical surveillance evidence which constituted a considerable part of the Crown case.
35The Crown also submitted that the appellant's prospects of success on the appeal were limited and that leave should be refused for that reason.  It was not submitted, however, that the grounds were inarguable.  While the appellant's counsel conceded the Crown case at trial was strong (which might affect application of the proviso), the two grounds of appeal ultimately pressed involve the conduct of the Crown prosecutor at trial which is said to have been productive of unfairness such as would justify a finding that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. 
36In this case, it is unsatisfactory, to say the least, that proceedings in this Court are heard to finality some four years after the notice of intention to appeal was filed.  However, in circumstances where the Crown does not submit that the explanation for the delay is not adequately explained and where I am satisfied that the interests of justice do not weigh against granting the extension, I am satisfied that the application for an extension of time to allow for the conviction appeal to be heard should be granted. 
The Crown case against the appeal
37The Crown alleged that the appellant conspired to import cocaine from South America concealed in cargo on a vessel operated by the Wallenius Wilhelmsen shipping line.  Wallenius Wilhelmsen shipped bulk cargo from South America to Australia using Patrick Stevedoring facilities at Darling Harbour exclusively for all its vessels.  The Crown alleged that with the cooperation of his co-accused Rogers, who was a former employee of Patrick (and other current employees), the appellant was to arrange for the cocaine to be removed after the vessel had docked at the container facility and then to distribute the cocaine via his associates.  After taking a half share of the proceeds he was to account for the balance to those with whom he had jointly financed the operation, one of whom was his co-accused Evans.  Despite the criminal agreement extending over 12 months, and despite the committed efforts of each of the co-conspirators both in Australia and overseas, no cocaine was in fact imported. 
38At trial the appellant did not challenge the existence of the conspiracy or its scope or terms.  On his behalf it was submitted that the evidence was not capable of establishing his complicity and that he should be acquitted.  
39The first ground of appeal concerns what the Crown relied upon as a discrete overt act attributed to the appellant in furtherance of the conspiracy.  A police officer gave evidence that he saw the appellant in the area of The Rocks on 1 June 2003 within hours of the ship which was expected to have the cocaine secreted on board arriving at Darling Harbour and at a time when, on the Crown case, other co-conspirators were also positioned to scan the area for any police presence and within minutes of another co-conspirator notifying those who were to offload the cocaine that the plan had been abandoned.  A witness who was the subject of what is alleged to have been unfair cross-examination by the Crown gave evidence supportive of the appellant's evidence that he was not the person seen by the police officer because he was at the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club in Kingsford at the time of the sighting.
40The Crown case against the appellant included evidence from a number of co-conspirators, each of whom gave evidence consistent with the role in the conspiracy attributed to the appellant by the Crown.  Principal amongst them were Steven James and John Morrison. 
41The appellant met James through Evans.  James and Evans were close friends.  The appellant, Evans and Rogers were members of the Clovelly Surf Club and had known each other for some years.  James described Rogers as a ""nodding acquaintance"".  It was the Crown case that through that shared association the appellant, James, Rogers and Evans planned and jointly financed the importation.  
42James gave evidence that he was in contact with, and the conduit for, information from the overseas suppliers of the cocaine through Morrison who lived in the United States.  James and Morrison met whilst they were serving sentences for drug offences in the United States in the 1990s.  Morrison's role was to arrange for the cocaine to be purchased and loaded aboard a vessel operated by the Wallenius Wilhelmsen shipping line out of Manzanillo, Panama.  James was in regular telephone contact with Morrison throughout the course of the conspiracy using a public telephone in Coogee.  As at June 2002 that telephone was already the subject of an interception warrant involving other suspects whose failed attempts to import cocaine, also through the use of Patrick Stevedores, had come to the attention of police.  The subject conspiracy came to the attention of police when James started using the telephone to speak with Morrison on behalf of the appellant and other co-conspirators.
43James pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.  He received a discount of 50 per cent for his plea of guilty, and his undertaking to give evidence against the appellant and his co-accused.  Morrison was dealt with in the United States for his role in the conspiracy and for other drug offences.  He entered into a plea agreement and, taking into account his past assistance, was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years and 5 months with a further 5 year probation period.  He agreed when giving his evidence that there was a prospect of a further reduction in his sentence by reason of having given evidence in the Australian proceedings.
44David Tipping (an employee of Patrick) gave evidence of what he was asked to do by Rogers and what he did to assist in locating and offloading cocaine from the vessel.
45James Gray-Spence gave evidence that he was asked by the appellant to assist in the distribution and sale of the imported cocaine.  He was sentenced for unrelated drug offences and received a 50 per cent discount for his assistance.
46Although James, Morrison, Gray-Spence and Tipping were accomplices whose evidence attracted the usual warning, the evidence of both James and Morrison, in particular, was supported by a large volume of intercepted telephone conversations during which they planned and discussed the importation.  There were no calls in which the appellant participated and no other intercepted calls directly implicating him in the conspiracy.  There was, however, a large volume of detailed visual surveillance of the appellant in company with James and other co-conspirators, both before and after some of what the Crown submitted were the critical telephone conversations between James and Morrison in June 2003.  James gave evidence of the code that was used when drugs and money were discussed and that he referred to the appellant variously as ""our friend"" or ""one of our friends"" when discussing ongoing arrangements with Morrison.  The appellant was not referred to by name.
47The evidence led by the Crown at trial to prove the existence of the conspiracy, its changing scope and terms over a period of 12 months between May 2002 and June 2003, and the appellant's active participation in it, is summarised below. 
The agreement and its terms
48In early 2002 the appellant and James discussed an importation into Australia by concealing cocaine in cargo to be shipped from South America.  The appellant represented that he could arrange to have the drugs offloaded if the vessel berthed at Darling Harbour, whilst James represented he could arrange to have the cocaine loaded in South America.  At about this time James also discussed an importation of cocaine by these means with Morrison and Evans. 
49In June/July 2002 James met with Morrison in Majorca, Spain where they discussed quantities of cocaine in the range of 10 to 20 kilograms and the necessary financial arrangements to fund the purchase of the drug.  By October 2002 it was agreed that US$100,000 was required and that Colin Kemery, an associate of Morrison who resided in Denmark, would travel to Australia to collect the money from the Australian financiers. 
50During this same period the appellant, James and Evans agreed that they would jointly provide the finance, with James and Evans contributing $40,000 each and the appellant $80,000.  The profits from the sale of the cocaine were to be split, with 50 per cent being shared between James, Evans and Morrison, and the remaining 50 per cent retained by the appellant to be shared with those with whom he was involved in the supply of the cocaine.  
Acts in furtherance of the conspiracy in 2002 
51On 1 October 2002 Rogers called directory assistance and enquired about the number for the Wallenius Wilhelmsen shipping line.  The following day Rogers telephoned the Wallenius Wilhelmsen shipping line from the public telephone in Coogee that was the subject of interception.  Under the pretext of importing cars from South America, Rogers enquired about shipping routes from South America, in the course of which reference was made to Manzanillo and Darling Harbour.  The appellant was seen by police at the telephone box when Rogers made the call.
52On 2 October 2002 Kemery, travelling under the false name of Jeffrey Spence, arrived in Sydney on a flight from London. 
53Between 2 October 2002 and 18 October 2002 James gave evidence that he and Evans met with Kemery on several occasions.  During this period he said he was given $65,000 by Evans on the appellant's behalf.  According to James, Evans told him that, ""Ricky is a bit short"".  Evans gave James $40,000 representing his contribution.  This money was then given to Kemery to deliver to Morrison. 
54Between 14 October 2002 and 18 October 2002 Kemery sent approximately $30,000 to nominated accounts in the United States and the United Kingdom by means of six Western Union transfers.  On 18 October 2002 he left Sydney on a flight to London.  
55Between October and December 2002 James and Morrison had various conversations concerning the fact that the funds given to Kemery had not arrived at their intended destination.  The whereabouts of that money was never resolved.
56In October 2002 the appellant gave James a document listing the names of ships operated by the Wallenius Wilhelmsen shipping line and their scheduled arrival dates in Sydney.  The appellant indicated a particular vessel scheduled to arrive at Darling Harbour in December which, according to James, he described as ""ideal"".  He also gave James two metal cargo security seals for use in the proposed importation which James later sent to Morrison and which were received by him.
57On 29 October 2002 Dean Rogers, the brother of the accused Rogers, leased an apartment in Kingsford for six months in a false name.  It was the Crown case that this was intended as a safe house for the storage of the cocaine, which it was anticipated would be arriving in December.  On 23 January 2003 the lease was cancelled when the shipment did not arrive.  This was the first of successive delivery dates that were cancelled over the ensuing six months, apparently due to the difficulties the exporters encountered in their attempts to have the cocaine loaded in Manzanillo without detection. 
Acts in furtherance of the conspiracy in 2003 
58On 15 January 2003 the appellant returned to Sydney after spending three weeks in New Zealand.  The following day while discussing the importation over the intercepted phone line, James told Morrison that ""our friend that went on holiday, he's back in town"".  It was the Crown case that was a reference to the appellant.
59On 29 January 2003 Morrison told James the arrangements were in place for the purchase of the cocaine.  James said that he did not intend to tell anyone about the developments ""except for one bloke"" and ""our other mate"" who he said he was intending to meet at the travel agency.  James later met with Evans at a travel agency in Paddington.  On the Crown case the other person James was referring to was the appellant. 
60On 19 February 2003 Morrison told James that he understood the cocaine would be loaded aboard the Tampa, a vessel operated by the Wallenius Wilhelmsen shipping line. 
61On 28 February 2003 James and Evans travelled to Canada, where they met with Morrison by pre-arrangement.  Morrison told them that a further US$28,000 was required for the purchase of the cocaine.  James and Evans returned to Australia on 18 March 2003. 
62Later that day Morrison provided James with details of accounts into which the additional US$28,000 required for the importation was to be the transferred.  The names were then given to Evans.  The following day James, using the false name of Christopher Woodford, remitted US$14,000 to an offshore account in three tranches comprising US$5,000, US$5,000 and US$4,000, while Evans, using the false name of Brian Lee, remitted US$14,000 to another offshore account in three tranches also comprising US$5,000, US$5,000 and US$4,000.  Morrison confirmed receipt of the money. 
63On 2 April 2003 the Tampa departed the port of Manzanillo. 
64On 4 April 2003 Morrison told James that the cocaine had not been successfully loaded aboard the Tampa, however they would aim to ship it on the Tawarrah, being the next vessel operated by the Wallenius Wilhelmsen shipping line to sail from Manzanillo.
65On 10 April 2003 Morrison told James that the cocaine had not been able to be loaded on the Tawarrah.  James told him that their partners would pull out of the venture if there were any further delays and that he would talk to the ""guy"" again.  James said, ""he's with me actually at the moment"".  The appellant was seen by police near the telephone box at that time.
66On 17 April 2003 Morrison told James that the cocaine would be shipped aboard the Texas, being the next vessel to sail from Manzanillo.  Morrison confirmed they were ""looking"" at shipping 30 kilograms. 
67On 27 April 2003 the Texas departed Manzanillo. 
68On 29 April 2003 Morrison told James that he was awaiting confirmation that the cocaine had been successfully loaded on the Texas.  James said he would tell the others.  At the end of the call James drove to the Clovelly Surf Life Saving Club (""Clovelly SLSC"") where he met with Evans and the appellant after which the appellant met with Rogers in the car park.  Rogers and the appellant drove to the Melonhead Cafe at Coogee.
69Later that day James again telephoned Morrison to enquire whether the cocaine had been loaded aboard the Texas.  Morrison indicated that he had no news.  James stated that he had spoken to ""some people"" and that they were interested to know what was going on.
70On 30 April 2003 Morrison told James the cocaine had not been loaded aboard the Texas.  James complained that he risked losing credibility with the others involved in the importation.  Morrison offered to talk to them to explain the situation.  James said the others would be ""shattered"".  He said he would go down and see them to ascertain whether anyone wanted to speak to Morrison and he would call back in half an hour.  James drove directly to the Clovelly SLSC where he met with Evans and the appellant.  The appellant told James he did not want to speak with Morrison.  Later that night Rogers picked up the appellant from his home and the two men drove to the Melonhead Cafe where the appellant was heard to say, ""he's not happy"" and ""what he really said was..."".
71Meanwhile James and Evans spoke with Morrison by telephone.  Morrison explained that problems had been encountered loading the cocaine due to increased security and sniffer dogs.  He referred to the ""Columbian guy"".  Evans reported that the others involved were angry and asked Morrison to attempt to get his people ""to put some extra on or knock something off the price"".
The anticipated arrival of the Tamerlane 
72On 2 May 2003 Morrison told James that he had been assured the cocaine would be loaded aboard the Tamerlane, the next vessel of the Wallenius Wilhelmsen shipping line to sail from Manzanillo.  The following day Morrison told James he was confident the cocaine would be shipped on the Tamerlane.  James said that he would speak with the others to update them about developments.  Immediately following this call James was observed to meet with Evans in the car park at the Clovelly SLSC.  The appellant had departed Australia for New Zealand that day.
73On 11 May 2003 the Tamerlane departed Manzanillo.
74On 12 May 2003 the appellant returned to Sydney.
75On 13 May 2003 Morrison told James that the cocaine had been successfully loaded aboard the Tamerlane.  James said he would inform ""our friends"" so that they could make the necessary preparations to have the cocaine offloaded.
76On 19 May 2003 James, in company with Evans, telephoned Morrison and asked about the details of how and where the cocaine had been concealed aboard the Tamerlane as ""another fellow"" required the information that day.  Morrison said he was drunk and did not want to risk driving to a public telephone.  Evans came on the line and pressed Morrison to call back but Morrison declined.  James asked Morrison to call him the following day.
77On the same day James sent the appellant a pager message which read, ""Richard, my girlfriend had the dates mixed up.  I won't see you tonight.  I will speak to you tomorrow.  Your mate from the beach"".  James gave evidence that his reference to ""girlfriend"" was a reference to Morrison.
78On 20 May 2003 Evans drove James to a public telephone in Maroubra where he telephoned Morrison and was given details of the location of the cocaine in a truck with Illinois number plates which was being shipped aboard the Tamerlane.  Throughout the conversation (which was not intercepted), Evans was observed to stand directly behind James at the entrance of the telephone box.  Immediately following the call Evans and James drove to the Clovelly SLSC where James, Evans and the appellant were observed to speak.  A few minutes later the appellant met with Rogers in the car park.  (On 28 May 2003 Morrison told James the cocaine was concealed in two bags behind the front seat of the truck aboard the Tamerlane and how the bags could be accessed.)
79On 21 and 22 May 2003 the appellant, Evans and Rogers were in each other's company at the Clovelly SLSC.
80On 23 May 2003 David Tipping and Andrew Maguire (both employed by Patrick at Darling Harbour) arranged to meet.  Rogers also arranged to meet with Maguire later that afternoon.
81On 29 May 2003 Rogers telephoned Maguire and arranged to meet with him.  Later that afternoon Maguire telephoned Tipping and they arranged to meet at Tipping's home.  The same afternoon Rogers met with Tipping in Randwick.  The following day another Patrick employee telephoned Tipping and discussed the anticipated arrival of the Tamerlane at Darling Harbour and their shifts, agreeing that it was sufficient if one of them was on shift.  Tipping stated that it did not matter so long as one of them was there.
82In late May 2003 the appellant told Gray-Spence that he had a lot of good quality cocaine arriving in the near future.
83On 30 May 2003 Dean Rogers hired a Hyundai Excel for a week using a false name.  The following day he hired a Toyota Camry station wagon for a period of six days.
84On 1 June 2003 Tipping, wearing a pair of gloves, drove the Hyundai Excel from his home at Randwick to the employees' car park at Patrick Stevedoring at Darling Harbour.  He was due to commence his shift at 11.00pm.  Tipping gave evidence that some time during the preceding week he had been told that the person who arranged the hire of the Hyundai was going out with some friends and that he was asked to drive the car to work so that person could pick up the car at about 3.00am.  He said he was given the keys to the vehicle which had been parked at his home.  It was the Crown case that the car was to transport the cocaine once it was offloaded.
85On the same day the Tamerlane berthed at Darling Harbour at about 8.00pm.  
86At about 9.00pm three men were observed by police seated at Observatory Park, Millers Point, overlooking Patrick's wharf at Darling Harbour.  When questioned by police they gave their names as Nathan Rogers, Peter James and John Adams.  The accused Rogers has a brother Nathan and James has a brother Peter.  The addresses and dates of birth the two men gave to police did not correspond with the brothers of the accused or the accused themselves.  A ""Uniden"" police radio scanner was located in the vicinity of where the men were spoken to by police.
87At about 10.20pm the appellant was identified by a police officer standing on Kent Street, Millers Point, from where the container terminal could be seen and a short distance from Observatory Park.  The police officer was in a motor vehicle.  The sighting was brief.
88At 10.32pm Rogers telephoned Maguire from a public telephone in George Street, Sydney, and informed him that the plan to collect the cocaine (from the truck on board the Tamerlane) had been abandoned.
89At about 2.52am on 2 June 2003, Tipping drove the Hyundai Excel from the employees' car park in Hickson Road to Millers Point, where he parked it, leaving the key on the floor in front of the driver's seat, before walking back to Patrick Stevedoring.  The vehicle was left unlocked.
90At 2.24pm on 2 June 2003 the appellant was seen by police to walk to and enter James' home in Coogee.  James gave evidence that the appellant reported to him that there was nothing on the boat, that they had looked through ""the whole thing"" and, further, that the vessel appeared to be under surveillance.  
91On 3 June 2003 James telephoned Morrison and informed him that he had been told there was no truck with Illinois number plates on the Tamerlane.  He said ""our friend"" was watching when the vessel arrived and that it appeared that the vessel was under surveillance, possibly by the police.  James indicated he would call back in an hour.  James then drove to the Clovelly SLSC where he met with Evans and the appellant.  The Crown alleged that James' reference to ""our friend"" was a reference to the appellant and that it confirmed the evidence of the police officer who identified the appellant in The Rocks on 1 June 2003.  In addition, Gray-Spence gave evidence that after 1 June the appellant told him that, ""the coke thing had gone pear shaped"".  He said the appellant also mentioned a hire car, a scanner and that he had been watching the Darling Harbour area.
92At about 10.57am on 3 June 2003 James called Morrison on a public telephone in Clovelly (the call was not intercepted).  James confirmed that there was no truck with Illinois number plates on the Tamerlane and, in addition, that the vessel appeared to have been under police surveillance.  Meanwhile, at about 11.01am that day the appellant was recorded inside Rogers' car saying, ""we'll go up there mate ... and give him my own opinion"".  The appellant was seen to walk to and stand next to James while he was speaking to Morrison. 
93On about 3 June 2003 the appellant told James that he would obtain a copy of the Tamerlane manifest. 
94On 3 June 2003 an unidentified male returned the Toyota Camry hired on 31 May 2003 to the hire company without collecting the deposit.  Later that day another unidentified male delivered a copy of a street map of the Millers Point area to the same hire company and indicated that the Hyundai was parked at a location marked on the map.  He apologised for the inconvenience in not returning the car personally and said he would forfeit the deposit. 
95On 4 June 2003 James telephoned Morrison and reiterated that the cocaine was not on the Tamerlane.  Morrison stated that he was making efforts to ascertain what had gone wrong.  James said that he was attempting to obtain a copy of the ship's manifest which he would fax to Morrison.  Immediately after the call James was observed to meet with Evans.
96Meanwhile Rogers met with the appellant after which he entered an apartment building where Maguire resided.  The appellant left carrying a small yellow coloured item. 
97On 5 June 2003 James called Morrison and asked for a number to which the manifest should be faxed.  He asked that it be marked for the attention of ""June Nielsen"".  James indicated that he expected he would be able to fax the manifest that evening. 
98On 6 June 2003 James sent the following pager message to the appellant, ""Rick I need your membership form ASAP.  Will be at the beach at midday, Gordon"".  James gave evidence that the reference to ""membership form"" was intended as a coded reference to the Tamerlane manifest. 
99On 8 June 2003 Morrison was arrested in California. 
100On 17 June 2003 James and Evans were arrested.  In James' car police located a three-page document comprising a manifest of the Tamerlane and a stowage plan marked for the attention of ""June Nielsen"". 
101On 2 July 2003 the appellant and Rogers were arrested. 
The case for the appellant at trial 
102The case for the appellant comprised his evidence and that of Lionel Potter, whose cross-examination is the subject of ground 1 on the appeal.
103The appellant gave evidence that he was raised in the eastern suburbs of Sydney and in about 1998 became an associate member of the Clovelly SLSC.  In 2002 and 2003 he frequented the Coogee Bay Hotel and the Royal Hotel in Randwick and participated in a range of sports.  He said he knew Evans from high school and knew Rogers through his father.  He denied discussing importing cocaine with Rogers or agreeing with Rogers to import cocaine.  The appellant said he knew James from the eastern suburbs area but was never a friend or close associate of his.  He said he was aware James had been arrested in the United States while working as a Qantas steward and did have casual contact with him at the Clovelly SLSC.  He denied providing James with security tags or seals, shipping schedules, or a manifest or stowage plan for the Tamerlane.  He said he did not discuss the port of Manzanillo with James.  He did say he had been asked to pass messages to James from Anthony Hines in June 2003 and that he understood that James owed Hines money.
104The appellant knew Gray-Spence by the name Steve Sanders and saw him from time to time in the Coogee area.  He said they sometimes gambled together.  He denied telling Gray-Spence that he had a shipment coming in that would make a lot of money or making any plans with him to distribute cocaine.  He denied telling Gray-Spence after his arrest that somebody had ""rolled"" on him. 
105The appellant knew Tipping through his wife and had seen him around the area and at the Royal Hotel in Randwick.  He denied discussing the importation of cocaine into Australia with Tipping or having any knowledge that Tipping had agreed to facilitate the removal of the cocaine from the Tamerlane.
106The appellant gave evidence that he had known Anthony Hines for over 20 years, first meeting him when Hines was in his late teens or early twenties.  They played football for the same team.  The appellant knew Hines to have engaged in violent and threatening behaviour on repeated occasions, including dragging a surfer from the surf and hitting him with a surfboard; producing a handgun in a club and shooting it in the air; carrying a gun at a Dolphin Street Nightclub and at the Coogee Bay Hotel; engaging in numerous fights with bouncers, patrons of the pubs, and the public; and belittling a woman in a restaurant who complained about him singing and later attacking her boyfriend with a pepper grinder in the same restaurant.  The appellant said he knew Hines by two nicknames: ""Captain Rats"" and ""La Loon"" (as in ""the lunatic""). 
107The appellant said that he was not with the accused Rogers at the telephone box in Coogee in October 2002 when Rogers telephoned the Wallenius Wilhelmsen shipping line.  He also said that to the best of the his knowledge he was not referring to James when he was overheard by police to say, ""He is not very happy"" in the Melonhead Café on 30 April 2003.  He said he may have been referring to someone else, perhaps Rogers or Hines, but not in relation to the conspiracy.  When cross-examined about the pager message James sent to the appellant on 19 May 2003 (see [62]) which the appellant acknowledged receiving, he denied it was a coded reference to the importation and suggested it may have been because James sent him a message to pass on to Hines.  He was unable to explain why James would be referring to Hines as ""Richard"".
108In addressing the evidence in the Crown case that he was in the area of The Rocks at 10.20pm on 1 June 2003, the appellant said he met with Lionel Potter that day and went with him to watch a football match at Kogarah Oval which started at 3pm.  He said he and Potter left the game about ten minutes before full-time and went to the Coogee Bay Hotel until about 7.30pm.  He said they then went to South Sydney Junior Leagues Club where they stayed together until about 10.30pm when Potter left the Club.  The appellant said he signed the sign-in book on arrival at the Club. 
109Potter gave similar evidence.  He said that on 1 June 2003 he went with the appellant to Kogarah Oval and watched a game of football between St George and the North Queensland Cowboys.  He said they left the game of football before full-time and got a taxi to the Coogee Bay Hotel where they drank for a couple of hours after which they caught a taxi to the South Sydney Juniors Leagues Club at Kingsford, arriving there at about 7.45pm.  They entered the club together.  Potter said he flashed a membership card at the entrance.  The appellant was directed to a sign-in area at the entrance and headed in that direction.  Potter waited for him and then joined with him drinking.  Potter left the club at exactly 10.30pm.  The appellant was with him at the Club up until that time.  
110On 2 June 2003, the day that James said the appellant visited him at his home and reported that the Tamerlane appeared to be under surveillance, the appellant gave evidence that he visited his mother at Norah Head, travelling there by public transport and returning to his premises at about 5pm or 5.30pm.  He denied visiting James that day.
111On 3 June 2003 the appellant said that during the morning he was at Clovelly SLSC and that he left with Rogers.  He also said that later that morning he saw Hines, who asked him whether he had seen James at the surf club that morning.  Hines seemed aggressive and said, ""You see him you tell him I've ... had enough of him, and I am going to give it to him"".  The appellant said he told Hines he had not seen James and that he would probably not see him until the following day.  The appellant returned to the surf club and asked after James.  He was told that James had just left.  The appellant intended relaying the message to James and telling James that he was an idiot if he was getting involved with Hines.  The appellant and Rogers then drove up the road and saw James in a telephone box.  The appellant approached James, who was talking on the telephone.  The appellant reported what had just happened with Hines and said to James, ""Whatever you are involved in eave me out ... he's an ... idiot"" and walked away.  This was relied upon to meet the evidence in the Crown case as summarised, that on 3 June 2003 he met with James at the telephone box knowing or expecting he was talking to Morrison.
112On another occasion the appellant said Hines had asked him to convey a message to James at the Clovelly SLSC to the effect that Hines was not very happy with him and that some time later Hines asked him whether he had given James the message.  He said he was then asked to tell James that everything ""will be sweet ... [Hines] will be seeing [James] shortly"".  
113As to the pager message sent to him by James on 6 June, he said in cross-examination that was in fact a reference to his membership of the surf club because he was changing his home address and not a reference to the manifest as contended for by the Crown in reliance on James' evidence.
Ground 1: The trial miscarried by reason of the conduct of the Crown and the nature of the unfair cross-examination of Lionel Potter
114Although Mr Potter was not an alibi witness in the strict sense, the significance of his evidence to the appellant's case would not have been lost on the jury.  Put simply, the Crown case against the appellant comprised a vast amount of incriminating evidence, principally the direct evidence of co-conspirators of his active role as an organiser and financier of the importation, allied with surveillance evidence where he is seen in company with his co-conspirators at relevant times, whereas it was the appellant's case that he had been falsely incriminated by these men and that his association with each of them was capable of an innocent explanation.  However, being at The Rocks on 1 June 2003 within hours of the long-awaited and much anticipated arrival of the Tamerlane could not be explained consistent with his innocence and no attempt was made by defence counsel to do so.  
115The sole import of Potter's evidence was to corroborate the appellant's evidence that he was not in The Rocks that night and, in that way, to further undermine the reliability of the evidence of the police officer who claimed to have identified the appellant, and ultimately, by that means, to raise a doubt as to the appellant's participation in the conspiracy.  
116This issue attracted considerable attention in the Crown case.  It included a challenge to the reliability of the identification in cross-examination which attracted a warning from the trial judge.  Although the police officer conceded that he might have been mistaken in his immediate recognition of the appellant, he did not concede that he was wrong.  
117Evidence bearing upon the circumstances in which the sign-in records from the Club were sought and obtained by the Crime Commission (and which did not show the appellant's attendance that night) was also the subject of contest.  Finally, the attention given to the issue by both counsel in closing addresses would have left the jury in no doubt that the question whether the appellant was at The Rocks was a critical issue in dispute and one they were invited by counsel to resolve.  
118The cross-examination of Potter was limited to a direct attack on his credit by reference to his criminal convictions.  He was not invited by the prosecutor to concede that he may have been mistaken about the date or the time that he claimed he was with the appellant at the football and the Club in June 2003 or that his memory was otherwise faulty given the effluxion of time.  The Crown put to him that he was telling lies to assist the appellant.
119After confirming that the witness could not name any of the other patrons at the Club the following questions were asked: [CROWN PROSECUTOR]Q. Have you ever been convicted of a criminal offence? OBJECTION
DEFENCE COUNSEL: This is an issue which I would have thought my friend would have asked leave to ask firstly.

Q. [STRIKE-OUT BEGINS] Lionel Arthur Abbott? [STRIKE-OUT   ENDS]
HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, are you sufficiently briefed to know the accuracy of this document you're taking thewitness to? There appears to be matters that don't appearto be matters that should be put if there are no convictions.
CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I had a document that was obviously missing an entry in relation to an appeal.
HIS HONOUR: Are you confident that that documenttherefore is accurate?
CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well, not in that context, your Honour,on that one matter.
HIS HONOUR: Mr Driels, have you seen that document?
DEFENCE COUNSEL: No, I have not your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Do you wish to see the document.
DEFENCE COUNSEL: Yes I do.
120An affidavit from defence counsel was read without objection on the appeal.  He said that Mr Potter had been called to give evidence at the earlier trial but was not cross-examined about his criminal convictions.  He said he had no notice that the Crown intended to raise them at the retrial.  He said:... Had I known that the Crown intended to cross-examine Mr Potter on his record, I would have asked the judge to rule on the proposed cross-examination in the absence of the jury.
I objected to the cross-examination in the belief that the Crown needed leave to ask questions purely as to credit.  I did not maintain the objections because I believed that once the question about Mr Potter's criminal record was asked the damage was done.  I did not realise that the most recent of the convictions was in 1961.
121After the jury and the witness retired, defence counsel was shown what was purported to be Potter's criminal antecedents in New South Wales and Queensland.  In discussion it became clear the document was not an authorised criminal record but an index card of some description on microfiche, the provenance of which was never made clear; that some entries were in a name other than that of the witness; and that the Queensland document was incomplete and other parts of it were illegible.  
122In the course of argument his Honour raised with the Crown the operation of s 103 of the Evidence Act 1995 which operated then (as it does currently) as an exception to the credibility rule in s 102.  Section 103 provided as follows:(1)  The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence has substantial probative value.
(2)  Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard in deciding whether the evidence has substantial probative value, it is to have regard to: (a)  whether the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the witness was under an obligation to tell the truth, and
(b)  the period that has elapsed since the acts or events to which the evidence relates were done or occurred.
123After defence counsel had reviewed what remained of the witness' admitted criminal convictions which, in addition to what was led in the presence of the jury, included a further two offences of stealing, assault, behaving in a disorderly manner and an incitement to resist arrest, he submitted that the age of all offences deprived them of any probative value.  All offences were committed between 1957 and 1961.  The Crown submitted that despite their age, the convictions had significant probative value because they were capable of demonstrating that the witness had a disregard for the law and the police.  The Crown did not submit that they reflected adversely on the witness' honesty generally or as a witness under oath.  
124A voir dire was then convened after which the Crown accepted that the only convictions that could be attributed to the witness were the stealing offence(s) and the possession of stolen property about which he had been questioned in the presence of the jury.  The trial judge disallowed further questioning of the witness on his criminal record.  It was clear from his Honour's exchange with counsel that he was not satisfied that any of the convictions had substantial probative value given their age and, further, were the issue to have been ventilated in the absence of the jury, he would not have permitted the Crown to cross-examine on the criminal record at all. 
125When the jury returned, the Crown prosecutor put to Potter that he was biased against police and that he had told lies to support his friend (both of which were denied).  He asked no further questions.  
126In re-examination, defence counsel led the date of Potter's convictions for stealing and being in possession of stolen property, doubtless in an effort to ameliorate the impact of the questions that had been asked by the Crown.  
127Defence counsel did not ask the trial judge to direct the jury that they should disregard cross-examination on the rape charge and did not seek a direction preventing the Crown from referring to the cross-examination of Potter on his criminal record in closing address.  No application was made to discharge the jury.
128In his closing address, when dealing with Potter's evidence as one aspect of the evidence bearing upon the question whether the jury was satisfied that the appellant was in the area of The Rocks at the relevant time, the Crown prosecutor reminded the jury that the only person the appellant called to give evidence of seeing him at the Club was Potter who ""could remember that he spent more than one term in imprisonment but couldn't remember how many"".  The Crown prosecutor went on to say:  It's very easy, I would suggest, a very easy lie to tell to support someone in those circumstances where there is no prospect of any positive evidence that could contradict it.  And I would suggest that's happened here in this trial.  You had the evidence from Potter that was false to try and prop up Mr Montgomery's suggestion that he wasn't in Kent Street in circumstances where there was a positive sighting of him from a police officer who will well knew what he looked like. 
129When dealing with Potter's evidence and the Crown prosecutor's criticism of him, defence counsel submitted in closing address as follows:Whether you like it or not he didn't come along polished.  He came along exactly what he was like Lionel Potter.  He worked at Cockatoo Island, he said, shipbuilding.  He worked for Woollhara Council.  A street sweeper.  He knew he was going to be embarrassed.  Knew he had a record.  And that's where the Crown went: you were not with Mr Montgomery at 10.20 on that night.  Not that he hadn't been to the football with him.  Not that he hadn't been to the Coogee Bay with him.  You weren't with him at South Juniors at 10.20 that night. You're a liar.  You're lying for your friend.  You're lying because you hate police.  No evidence that he hated police.  You're lying because you would help a friend.  You're lying because you're embarrassed about being in jail, 50 years ago.  No evidence of being in jail since 1957, 1958.
That's enough.  In our community for a Crown prosecutor to call a man, who on a second occasion coming along, knowing what he was going to get hit with, with the embarrassment of it, even pushed to the outrageous position of putting to him that he was convicted of rape when he wasn't.  The best that senior counsel could do.  50 years ago. 
...50 years ago he was in trouble and that's enough to call him a liar here ...
130The trial judge made no reference in the summing up to Mr Potter's cross-examination or the Crown's submissions in his closing address.
131Although the questions about Potter's prior convictions were asked and answered in the presence of the jury without objection (in circumstances deposed to by Mr Driels, perhaps understandably), on the appeal it was submitted that given the obvious potential for the line of questioning to prejudice the jury's assessment of Potter's credibility, the Crown prosecutor ought not to have cross-examined about what he well knew were very old criminal convictions without affording defence counsel the opportunity to be heard on whether they had substantial probative value under s 103(1) of the Evidence Act and, if appropriate, to object to the questions in their entirety.  
132It was submitted that the Crown ought to have been on notice from the poor quality of the records, and the fact that they referred to a person with a different name from the witness, that there may have been concerns about the reliability and accuracy of some of the entries and, quite independently of their age, that this should have at least sounded a note of caution necessitating that he seek a ruling as to whether he would be permitted to cross-examine upon the records before launching into a cross-examination without notice to defence counsel.  
133It was submitted that since this did not happen the cross-examination of Potter was unfair and productive of a miscarriage of justice.
134On the appeal the Crown did not seek to argue with any conviction that the questions asked in cross-examination before the jury were invited to retire would have satisfied the test of admissibility if the issue had been fully ventilated in their absence.  For my part, I am unable to see how Potter's convictions (as admitted) had the potential to have a persuasive bearing upon his credit.  The Crown's submission at trial that the probative value of the evidence of his convictions over 40 years earlier was in its capacity to reflect a disregard for the law and the police, failed to appreciate the need for the Crown to establish a necessary connection between the evidence sought to be adduced and whether the witness ought to be believed when he claimed he was in the appellant's company when the police identified the appellant elsewhere in order for it to satisfy the test of substantial probative value.
135In R v El-Azzi [2004] NSWCCA 455, Simpson J observed at [180]-[183]:[180] ""Probative value"" is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as: ""... the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.""
[181] That definition, however, does not apply to the use of the term ""(substantial) probative value"" as it is used in s 103(1). In R v RPS, unreported, NSWCCA, 13 August 1997, Hunt CJ at CL, with whom Gleeson CJ and Hidden J agreed, said: ""Section 103 of the Evidence Act limits cross-examination as to credit to adducing evidence which has 'substantial probative value'. The 'probative value' of evidence is defined in the s3 Dictionary as meaning 'the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue', but both the context in which that phrase appears and the subject matter of s103 indicate that that definition does not apply. That is made clear by the terms of subs(2), which demonstrate that the evidence must have probative value in relation to the credit of the witness. Evidence adduced in cross-examination must therefore have substantial probative value in the sense that it could rationally affect the assessment of the credit of the witness. Such an interpretation accords with the intention of the Law Reform Commission. The addition of the word 'substantial' nevertheless imposes a limitation upon the common law, when almost anything was allowed upon the issue of credit unless it clearly had no material weight whatsoever upon that issue. That limitation is an important one."" ('not' in the second sentence is italicised in the original; the emphasis placed on the fourth sentence is added; internal references omitted)
[182] That view of the meaning of the term was endorsed by the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd [2000] FCA 1886; 106 FCR 51, per Sackville J, with whom Whitlam and Mansfield JJ agreed. (RPS was the subject of a successful appeal to the High Court: RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3; 199 CLR 620, but on matters unrelated to the present question.) 
[183] In my opinion, for this evidence to have had substantial probative value within the meaning of s 103(1), it must have had the potential to have a real bearing upon the assessment of the appellant's credibility - and, particularly, to the appellant's credibility in relation to the evidence he had given, or would give, at the trial. It cannot have had substantial probative value for the purposes of s 103(1) unless it was capable, in a significant way, of bearing upon that assessment.
136While in other circumstances questioning an alibi witness about criminal convictions for dishonesty might satisfy the test of admissibility under s 103(1) (see R v Lumsden [2003] NSWCCA 83 per Hulme J at [56], Mason P agreeing at [3]), in my view, the sheer age of Potter's convictions deprived the evidence of the capacity to bear rationally and logically upon his veracity and for that reason the cross-examination was unfair and productive of prejudice.  While I accept that it would appear that the Crown prosecutor was unaware that the rape conviction had been overturned on appeal (assuming that to be the fact), again, as a result of the quality of the record he was cross-examining from, I have grave doubts whether that conviction, even if admitted, would satisfy the test of admissibility under s 103 in this case.  
137The appellant's counsel also submitted that this Court would be satisfied that the prosecutor deliberately omitted any reference to the age of the convictions when framing his questions in cross-examination, intending to overcome what he knew would almost certainly deprive them of the probative value necessary for their admissibility, and in this way he acted improperly.  
138Although there is some basis for inferring that the Crown deliberately framed the questions to avoid reference to the age of the convictions (perhaps in the expectation that, if admitted, they would operate to undermine the witness' credit without prompting further enquiry), I am unable to safely conclude that his motivations were of that kind.  I am however satisfied that, in the proper discharge of his duties and responsibilities as prosecutor, he ought to have approached the cross-examination of Potter to avoid the risk of unfair prejudice to the presentation of the appellant's case in circumstances where the records he was cross-examining from suggested that the entries, or some of them, may not refer to the witness at all and others were likely to be of doubtful probative value because of their age.  This could easily have been achieved by raising the issue in the absence of the witness after his evidence in chief and, if necessary, asking that a voir dire be convened before cross-examination without depriving the Crown of the forensic advantage of a successful attack on Potter's credit if the line of cross-examination were to be allowed which would have ensured against unfairness if the questioning were disallowed.  
139Having resolved to the view that the cross-examination of Potter resulted in the admission of prejudicial evidence and that the Crown could have avoided the risk of prejudice in the way I have suggested, the question is whether the cross-examination generated such unfairness that the trial miscarried.  
140The Crown submitted that any prejudice was eliminated by the manner in which the trial judge dealt with the issue (that is, by striking out the reference to the other person's name) and by the questions asked by the appellant's counsel in re-examination establishing the age of the convictions.  The Crown also submitted that other evidence in the Crown case bearing on the question whether the identification evidence should be accepted was of such collective strength that even with the trial judge's directions to the jury that they should approach the identification evidence with caution, it was open to them to be satisfied that the appellant was in the area of The Rocks on the evening of 1 June 2003, the attack on Potter's credibility by reference to his criminal record would have had little impact.  The Crown submitted that not only was the evidence of Potter and the appellant that they were in Kingsford contradicted by the identification evidence, but there was also a confirmed sighting of Rogers in the area of The Rocks shortly after the appellant was sighted, in circumstances where, on the Crown case, Rogers (who was regularly in the appellant's company throughout the conspiracy) was notifying others by telephone that the plan to unload the cocaine had been abandoned.  In addition, the Crown submitted that the sign-in slips from the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club did not show any entry corresponding to a visit by the appellant on 1 June 2003, despite his evidence and Potter's evidence that he signed in upon entry, and that this further undermined their evidence that they were at the Club that night.  
141Despite the force of the Crown's submissions on the extent of prejudice occasioned by the cross-examination, in my view the questions asked by the prosecutor were productive of a miscarriage of justice.  The appellant was entitled to have the jury consider the evidence given by Potter on its merits.  The way the appellant's defence was mounted at trial, Potter's evidence was capable of bearing critically on the jury's consideration of the truthfulness of his evidence that he was not in The Rocks on 1 June 2003 (and, for that reason, not a participant in the conspiracy as the Crown contended) and that both James and Tipping should not be believed when they gave evidence that effectively put him in The Rocks on the evening of 1 June 2003, as contended for by the Crown.
142I would uphold the first ground of appeal.
Ground 2: The trial miscarried by reason of the conduct of the Crown and the nature of the cross-examination of the appellant where an irrelevant and prejudicial association was raised, namely Jai Abberton, effectively raising the bad character of the appellant
143Ground 2 also concerns the conduct of the Crown prosecutor as cross-examiner, on this occasion his cross-examination of the appellant.  The question said to be productive of prejudice and a resultant miscarriage of justice was asked in the context of the appellant being cross-examined about events after his release to bail on 1 August 2003, including his association with Hines at the Coogee Bay Hotel on 5 August 2003 (the night he was killed by Jai Abberton). 
144The essence of the appellant's case in so far as it related to Hines was that he had known him for many years as a person with a capacity for violence and intimidation and that he had seen him with a gun on a number of occasions.  He also gave evidence that he had passed messages between Hines and James in 2003 during the course of the conspiracy at Hines' request which accounted for his being in James' company on a number of occasions, in particular on 3 June 2003, a proposition which James denied.  
145The Crown led evidence from James as to his knowledge of, and any relationship he had with Hines in anticipation of the appellant and Evans seeking to implicate Hines as the principal co-conspirator with James.  James gave evidence that he was involved in obtaining a false passport for Hines from Morrison and had received money for that purpose and that Hines had purchased cocaine from him from two previous successful drug importations.  He denied that Hines was involved in the conspiracy to import cocaine the subject of the trial.  These questions were not objected to by the appellant or either of his co-accused.  
146The Crown did not lead evidence from James that Hines had any demonstrated propensity to violence.  It was the appellant's counsel who raised Hines' violent disposition with James who conceded that Hines was ""extremely violent"", and was ""a person who had a fearsome reputation for beating people up"".  He also agreed that Hines was ""naturally paranoid"" and ""a drug dealer"", but he repeatedly denied that the appellant had passed messages to him from Hines or that the appellant warned him that Hines was angry because James had not produced the false passport or the money that was owed. 
147It was also the appellant's counsel who first introduced the fact that Hines had been killed in August 2003, however no reference was made to the fact that the person charged with his murder was Jai Abberton or that he was acquitted of murder on the grounds of self-defence in 2005.  On the appeal the Crown submitted that the appellant's complaint about the Crown prosecutor's cross-examination is diminished by the fact that it was through defence counsel's cross-examination of James that Hines' death by killing was introduced into evidence in the trial, where a more neutral reference to him as having since deceased might have sufficed to explain his absence (and perhaps the fact that he was not charged).
148The cross-examination (which had to this point extended over three days) leading into the objectionable question was directed to exploring the nature of the appellant's relationship with Hines in more detail.  
149The appellant agreed that he had known Hines for 25 years but said that, although they were not close friends, they might have a drink together at the Coogee Bay Hotel.  The Crown put to the appellant that he ""mixed with"" Hines frequently, to which the appellant responded, ""not frequently"".  These questions were not the subject of any objection at trial, no doubt in recognition of the fact that the Crown was entitled to test the appellant's claim that he had no involvement in the arrangement to import cocaine and that he only passed messages to James on Hines' behalf because he was fearful of him.  Additionally, although the cross-examination concerned the appellant's contact with Hines after he was released on bail on 1 August 2003 (that is, after the conspiracy was over), no objection was taken to the cross-examination for that reason, presumably because counsel accepted the relationship with Hines was relevant even at that time.  It was not submitted otherwise on the appeal.
150As to that time frame, the appellant said that he saw and spoke with Hines twice.  The first occasion was in a newsagency where they spoke about general things including the fact that Hines was angry with James because of an unpaid debt, about which the appellant said he asked no questions.  He also said that Hines was inquisitive about who else had been charged with the conspiracy and that he told the appellant he had just returned from the United States where he had been refused entry, also a matter about which the appellant asked no questions.  The Crown queried why he did not ask any questions about the debt or Hines' claim to have been refused entry to the United States despite the fact that, on his case, he was trusted enough to pass messages between James and Hines.  The appellant said that that Hines was not the sort of person that he would ask questions of, the inference being because of his irascibility and his violent reputation.
151The appellant was then asked about the second occasion when he saw and spoke with Hines after his release to bail:Q.  What was the second occasion on which you saw Mr Hines? A.  The second occasion was the night I was at the Coogee Bay having drinks with friends. 
Q.  What night was that? A.  I think it would have been about 4 or 5 August. 
Q.  Was there some particular event that night that enables you to identify the date? A.  Tone Hines was murdered that night. 
Q.  5 August you mean Mr Montgomery? A.  I wasn't sure, 5 or 4 August. 
Q.  So you were having a drink at the hotel? A.  Yes.    [STRIKEOUT BEGINS]Q.  With friends. Was that with Mr Hines and Mr Jyham--[STRIKEOUT ENDS] 
OBJECTION (DRIELS)
A. No, no-one was--
152It was agreed at the trial, and for the purposes of the appeal, that the reference to ""Mr Jyham"" (as transcribed) should read ""Mr Jai Abberton"" and that it was a sensitivity to his name as the head of a local gang self-styled as ""the Bra Boys"", as the trial had progressed to that point, that immediately prompted the trial judge to ask the jury to retire without ruling on the objection in their presence.  It was also understood at trial, and accepted for the purposes of the appeal, that the Bra Boys were a gang local to the eastern suburbs of Sydney who were notoriously involved in street violence and that Jai Abberton was the leading member.  
153In the absence of the jury, the trial judge immediately invited the prosecutor to justify the relevance of including in a question about the nature of the relationship between the appellant and Hines (a legitimate subject for cross-examination) the fact that Jai Abberton was a friend of the appellant with whom he was in company on the night of Hines' death, in circumstances where the Crown well knew that Jai Abberton had killed him later that night.  The trial judge's sensitivity to the issue, and his immediate reaction to the potential prejudice in the question, needs to be understood in the context of the Crown being on notice from repeated exchanges with defence counsel during the trial that any references, whether in direct or in oblique terms, to the Bra Boys would be objected to and the trial judge's ruling that the Crown should avoid any references of that kind at all costs.  
154After argument in the absence of the jury the question which was objected to was struck from the record.  No further direction was sought by defence counsel at that time, or later, as to what the jury should do with the question in the event that they heard it (or the answer), defence counsel having apparently taken the view that it was advisable not to draw attention to it in the event that some of the jurors may not have heard it or those that heard it had not recognised the name.  Thereafter the cross-examination of the appellant resumed without further reference to Hines or the appellant's association with him. 
155The trial judge was clearly of the opinion that the question carried with it an obvious prejudice by including a completely irrelevant reference to Jai Abberton.  In addition, although his Honour was extremely critical of what he regarded as the Crown deliberately posing the question as to the friends the appellant was with on 5 August 2003 to include the name ""Jai Abberton"" without any legitimate forensic justification, an application for the jury to be discharged was refused.  (That ruling was not challenged on the appeal.)  That is where the issue rested at trial.  There was no further reference to Jai Abberton or the Bra Boys in the evidence or in counsels' closing addresses.
156The appeal was first listed for hearing in August 2011.  In the course of senior counsel (then appearing for the appellant) identifying the prejudice said to flow from the reference to Jai Abberton, it became obvious that the appellant had not filed any evidence establishing the notoriety of that person (or the Bra Boys) at or before the time of trial to support the submission that a miscarriage of justice had been occasioned.  (I note that when considering the application to discharge the jury mounted by the appellant's counsel at trial, his Honour also referred to the difficulty the accused faced in establishing the extent of risk of unfairness when, despite the fact that he was familiar with Jai Abberton by name, he had no way of assessing whether the jury was also aware of him or the context in which they may have known who he was.)
157In oral submissions in August 2011 the Court was informed about a documentary film featuring Jai Abberton and his brothers and associates entitled ""The Bra Boys"", which had apparently attracted wide public release following its premiere in March 2007 and which was said to cast Jai Abberton as the leader of the gang.  Although it is not clear that the earlier objections to any reference to the Bra Boys was as a result of the release of the film (as distinct from other sources of publicity or community notoriety about the gang by which association the accused was said to be prejudiced), the objection to the reference to Jai Abberton was, as trial counsel put it, not only because of his membership of the Bra Boys but because of the notoriety attaching to the circumstances in which Hines was killed by Jai Abberton on 5 August 2003, and the fact that the appellant was in the company of Abberton that night, a person who the Crown suggested was a friend of the appellant.  
158Counsel ultimately accepted that since the documentary film was not in evidence (and there was no other evidence of Jai Abberton's notoriety) an adjournment was necessary in order to assemble evidence to support the contention that a miscarriage of justice had resulted from the Crown's reference to him.  The Crown did not oppose the adjournment.  
159On 18 November 2011 the appellant filed an affidavit of Kate Herczog which annexed a compendious volume of articles from the print and electronic media assembled by Media Monitors where reference had been made either to Jai Abberton, the Bra Boys and/or ""Tony Hines"" between December 2002 and March 2007.  
160When the hearing of the appeal resumed there was considerable debate, and some shifting of position by both the Crown and senior counsel then appearing for the appellant, as to whether the DVD of the documentary should be exhibited.  In the result, neither the DVD nor the script of the documentary was tendered.  
161In addition, senior counsel then appearing for the appellant refined, and to an extent recast, what was said to be the prejudice flowing from the question asked of the appellant grounding what was said to be causative of a miscarriage of justice.  In the result, very little of the material exhibited to Ms Herczog's affidavit was ultimately relied upon.  
162In the course of developing his submissions counsel accepted that he needed to establish that there was a reasonable possibility that the jury heard the question to include the name Jai Abberton; that they then linked that name with the Bra Boys; that they knew something of the reputation of that gang and that they knew Jai Abberton had killed Hines on 5 August 2003. 
163As to the first matter, the court stenographer either did not hear the name or did not identify it with any name with which he or she was familiar.  However, the transcript of argument at the trial puts it beyond doubt that both counsel and the trial judge immediately heard the name as ""Jai Abberton"".  That reaction may well be explained by the atmosphere of the trial and the heightened sensitivity of both defence counsel and the trial judge to any names associated with the Bra Boys, together with the fact that Jai Abberton's acquittal of the murder of Hines two years earlier was well known to counsel (Evans' counsel having represented him at trial) and apparently to the trial judge.
164That said, I am unable to discount the reasonable possibility that the release of the documentary ""The Bra Boys"" within months of the commencement of the trial, and with the widespread media attention it attracted over a period of weeks following its release as borne out by the evidence, that at least one member of the jury heard the name Jai Abberton, associated him with the Bra Boys and with the murder of Hines, and appreciated that the question from the Crown implied that not only was Hines a friend of the appellant (and not the casual acquaintance he claimed to be in fear of) but that Jai Abberton was also a friend of his. 
165There was considerable press interest in the release of the documentary, as evidenced by the press reports exhibited to Ms Herczog's affidavit (perhaps explained by the involvement of Russell Crowe as narrator).  Variously, the gang is described as a notorious surfie gang boasting a ""brotherhood culture"" and involved in bloody street brawls with police.  They are also valorised as local heroes ""on the quest to find the biggest wave ... defending their beach against rival gangs ... and brokering peace in the Cronulla race riots"".  The evidence also makes it clear that the murder trial was referred to in the documentary as was Jai Abberton's celebrated acquittal by reason of self-defence (he asserted that he believed that Hines was going to rape his girlfriend and kill him).  However, what was not suggested in the reviews of the documentary or the press reports about it was an association between the gang and drug dealing.  Of the great volume of press reports annexed to Ms Herczog's affidavit only one in the Sunday Telegraph of 11 March 2007 refers to an association between the gang and Jai Abberton and drugs and only then nominating Hines as the gang leader.Hines was head of the gang
Documents prepared by the Australian Federal Police paint a far darker picture of the underworld activities of the Bra Boys than does their one-sided documentary. 
The AFP identified the gang as an ""eastern-suburbs drug syndicate"" in 2003, two reports obtained by The Sunday Telegraph now reveal.
The reports also identify the late standover man, Anthony Hines, who was shot dead by Jai Abberton, as head of the Bra Boys and detail his extensive overseas travel and drug links.
...
While parts of [the report] are heavily edited, it is headed ""importation via small craft"".  It states: ""Anthony Gerard Hines ... is the syndicate head of the Bra Boys, [an] import and distribution syndicate in the eastern suburbs. 
""Hines is believed to have organised the distribution of cocaine on behalf of [Mr X, another criminal].""
166To the extent that counsel relied upon the jury connecting Jai Abberton with drugs and thereby connecting the appellant to drugs and a drug dealer by association, the evidence falls short of establishing that link.  Counsel also relied upon newspaper reports where Jai Abberton (as the leader of the Bra Boys) was referred to adversely from time to time over five years between 2002 and 2007 by reason of his repeated and sometimes violent encounters with police.  I do not regard these relatively random reports, standing alone, as bearing upon the extent to which prejudice flowed from the question struck out.  I am also of the view that the press reports in 2005 in connection with Jai Abberton's trial for the murder of Hines, and his celebrated acquittal, are not capable of bearing the prejudice for which the appellant contends in a trial two years later.  What remains material, and for the reasons discussed, is the featuring of Jai Abberton and the Bra Boys in the documentary launched in 2007 and the huge public interest evidenced by its distribution, in the months before trial. 
167As I see it, narrowed in this way, the question is to assess the extent to which the assertion implicit in the Crown prosecutor's question that the appellant was a friend of Jai Abberton (a name the jury might reasonably associate with the Bra Boys), and in his company on the night he shot and killed Hines, was productive of prejudice, or the risk of prejudice, so as to render his trial unfair and occasion a miscarriage of justice.  Succinctly put, it was submitted that the question cast the appellant as a criminal by association with (his friend) Jai Abberton and in that way it exceeded the legitimate bounds of a cross-examination directed to undermining his credibility.  I accept that submission.
168I am also well satisfied that the prosecutor knew of defence counsel's sensitivity to any reference to the Bra Boys or its members and that his reference to Jai Abberton was deliberate, in the sense that it was not inadvertent or the result of an excess of the enthusiasm of the cross-examiner seeking to expose fundamental flaws in the appellant's defence.  Were that the explanation, the prosecutor had every opportunity to make that plain in the lengthy exchanges with the trial judge in the absence of the jury.  Rather, he sought to justify the question, and in particular the reference to Jai Abberton, as giving context to the occasion that the appellant was with Hines shortly after his release to bail.  It is difficult in those circumstances to come to any other view than that the prosecutor was at least reckless in making express reference to Jai Abberton and, in that way, he acted contrary to the exacting standards expected of a Crown prosecutor. 
169In Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21 at [578] McClellan CJ at CL observed: The duty to present a case fairly, completely and with fairness to the accused was emphasised in Livermore v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 334; (2006) 67 NSWLR 659 at [24] where this Court cited with approval the dicta in McCullough v The Queen (1982) 6 A Crim R 274; [1982] Tas R 43 at 57: ""[It is] quite impermissible [for a Crown Prosecutor] to embark upon a course of conduct calculated to persuade the jury to a point of view by the introduction of factors of prejudice or emotion. If such a situation should develop and there is a real risk that the conduct complained of may have tipped the balance against the accused then an appellate court will not hesitate to follow the safe course and order a new trial."" 
170In Libke v R [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 one of grounds of appeal concerned the cross-examination of the accused by the prosecutor which was said to be so unfair as to result in a miscarriage of justice.  Although the appeal was dismissed by majority because, despite the prosecutor's misconduct, the trial was not shown to have been unfair (Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing with Hayne J (Kirby and Callinan JJ dissenting), each of the judgments with differing degrees of emphasis expressly disapproved of the form, content and style of the cross-examination.  
171The offending questions were categorised and discussed variously as being wild, uncontrolled and offensive, questions that were not questions but comment, compound questions, cutting off the witness' answers, questions resting on controversial assumptions and questions that were argumentative.  
172After considering the way in which the role, rights and responsibilities of prosecuting counsel form an integral part of a fair trial, Hayne J observed:[71] A criminal trial in Australia is an accusatorial and adversarial process.  In that process, prosecuting counsel has a role that is bounded by long-established duties and responsibilities.  Those duties and responsibilities are summarised when it is said that ""[t]he duty of prosecuting counsel is not to obtain a conviction at all costs but to act as a minister of justice"".  In the Supreme Court of Canada, Rand J described the role of the prosecutor as being:
not to obtain a conviction, it is to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a crime. Counsel have a duty to see that all available legal proof of the facts is presented: it should be done firmly and pressed to its legitimate strength but it must also be done fairly. The role of prosecutor excludes any notion of winning or losing; his function is a matter of public duty than which in civil life there can be none charged with greater personal responsibility. It is to be efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the seriousness and the justness of judicial proceedings. (emphasis added)
A central, even the central, element in that role is ""ensuring that the Crown case is presented with fairness to the accused"".
[72] The prosecution case is to be presented in the context of an adversarial process in which each side ""is free to decide the ground on which it or he will contest the issue, the evidence which it or he will call, and what questions whether in chief or in cross-examination shall be asked"".  But again, there are boundaries to that process. The choices that have been described are to be made ""subject to the rules of evidence, fairness and admissibility""...
173His Honour went on to note that while unfairness may take many forms, often it involves a departure from rules, including the rules of evidence, that ensure the orderly conduct of a trial.  However, as his Honour observed, not every departure from that standard will be productive of unfairness.  That said, his Honour also noted at [73] that:... because the rules of orderly procedure are designed to safeguard the fairness of the proceedings, what is unfair will often be a departure from those rules.
174At [78], after noting that none of the questions said to have constituted an unfair cross examination on credit were objected to, his Honour said: In the present case, if comments made by the trial prosecutor are put to one side, the complaints of unfairness that now are made directed attention to the way in which the prosecutor set out to undermine the appellant's credibility. It was said that this was done ""unfairly"".  The appellant identified a number of questions as evidencing this ""unfairness"".  Some, the appellant said, were founded on a false or unproved assertion. Others, he submitted, made unwarranted criticism of evidence he had given.  But leaving aside the prosecutor's intrusion of his comments on the evidence, the cross-examination, when read as a whole, betrays no unfairness to the appellant.  Some questions might have been framed better than they were.  Some carried imputations critical of the appellant's evidence.  Some questions were founded on assertions that were not established or admitted. But the appellant was able to and did give the account he wished to give of the events about which he was asked.  And whether the cross-examination was such as to distract the jury from a proper and dispassionate examination of the issues in the case requires consideration of not only those questions that were said to be designed unfairly to undermine the appellant's credibility, but also the various comments made by the trial prosecutor in the course of his examination of the appellant.
175His Honour went on at [81] to say:  The comments the trial prosecutor made, in the course of cross-examining the appellant, departed from the rules that ensure the orderly conduct of a trial. But that observation does not answer the critical question presented by the appeal provision of the Criminal Code, which is said to be engaged. That question is whether there was a ""miscarriage of justice"". More particularly, did the making of these comments, either standing alone, or in conjunction with other aspects of the prosecutor's cross-examination of the appellant, make the trial unfair?
176His Honour also distinguished the prosecutor's comments (which he noted were about matters in issue in the case), from inappropriate comments which suggested, either directly or indirectly, that the jury should follow some impermissible path of reasoning perhaps by appealing to prejudice or sympathy. 
177Heydon J was of the express view that the cross-examination was in breach of counsel's ethical duties which were also breaches of rules established by the laws of evidence. 
178At [120] his Honour said:""Cross-examination is a powerful and valuable weapon for the purpose of testing the veracity of a witness and the accuracy and completeness of his story. It is entrusted to the hands of counsel in the confidence that it will be used with discretion; and with due regard to the assistance to be rendered by it to the Court, not forgetting at the same time the burden that is imposed upon the witness.""  Hence the powers given to cross-examiners are given on conditions, and among the relevant conditions are those which underlie the rules of evidence contravened in this case.
179At [134] his Honour held:  While the breaches of exclusionary rules discussed above were capable of placing the accused in an unfair position, taken as a whole the breaches generated neither unfairness nor a miscarriage of justice. That is so partly because, despite interruptions, the accused was able to get his version of events across. It is so partly because at least the questions (as distinct from the comments) were not irrelevant and hence did not influence the jury towards an illogical approach to the issues. It is so partly because the uncontrolled ineptness of the questioning was such as to attract sympathy to the accused. Evidently designed to disparage and humiliate the accused, the questioning is likely to have rehabilitated him in the jury's eyes as he struggled with success towards advancing an account of the events to which the questioning related. The very egregiousness of the conduct generated safeguards against the dangers inherent in it. ""[T]he adoption of an unfair conduct in cross-examination has often an effect repugnant to the interests which it professes to promote.""85 Here the overly aggressive and unfair approach of the cross-examiner was one which was likely to have generated sympathy in the jury for the accused. Even if it did not, the accused showed himself capable of pointing out the defects of the cross-examination in a dignified way, and overcoming them.
180Gleeson CJ emphasised that whether the conduct of the prosecutor as cross-examiner resulted in an unfair trial and a miscarriage of justice involved a question of degree.  His Honour said at [2]: First, the argument that the conduct of the prosecutor during his cross-examination of the appellant resulted in an unfair trial, and a miscarriage of justice, involved a question of degree. As Mullins J pointed out in the Court of Appeal, the cross-examination of the appellant extended over 44 pages of transcript. In the course of that cross-examination, counsel made certain inappropriate comments. It is difficult for an appellate court, relying only on the written record, to assess the impact of undisciplined conduct by counsel. It is also difficult, away from the atmosphere of the trial, to measure the significance of the absence of intervention by the trial judge or by opposing counsel. Those difficulties are to be taken into account by way of caution in approaching any attempt to minimise the complaints made on behalf of the appellant. Even so, having read the whole of the evidence of the appellant, I would not interfere with the Court of Appeal's conclusions that the conduct of the prosecutor did not make the trial unfair.
181While in the present case the prosecutor's conduct in deliberately framing a question with a prejudicial sting is not a wholly irrelevant consideration to assessing whether unfairness has resulted, as the High Court has made plain in Libke, it is not determinative of whether the trial miscarried.  What is determinative is whether the objectionable part of the question was such as to be productive of an unfair trial.  
182I have given earnest consideration to the potential prejudicial implications of the offending question consistent with my finding at [167] that the question cast the appellant as a criminal by association with (his friend) Jai Abberton and in that way it exceeded the legitimate bounds of a cross-examination directed to undermining the appellant's credibility.  However, after taking into account the fact that on the appellant's case he passed messages between people who either he knew, or it might be inferred, had criminal records and, in the case of Hines, a man with a violent disposition; the fact that the appellant dealt with a detailed cross-examination that extended over four days with apparent resilience and control; where the offending question was one of very few questions objected to and disallowed and where no further reference was made to it; and where, in this case, there are limitations on making any accurate assessment as to how the question actually impacted on the jury, I am not persuaded that the trial was rendered unfair by the question objected to and struck out.  I would dismiss the second ground of appeal.
The proviso
183The upholding of the first ground of appeal calls into consideration the application of the proviso and, accordingly, a determination whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred in circumstances where an important witness called by the appellant was cross-examined in such a way that his credit was attacked without proper evidential justification. 
184The approach to the application of the proviso in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act was settled in Weiss v R [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300; 158 A Crim R 133 and recently confirmed in Cooper v R [2012] HCA 50; 293 ALR 17 where at [20] the Court identified the three propositions which are fundamental to its application: ...First, the appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.  Second, the task is objective, and is to be performed with whatever are the advantages and disadvantages of deciding an appeal on the record of the trial.  Third, the standard of proof of criminal guilt is proof beyond reasonable doubt.
185The Court went on to say at [21]:Performance of the appellate court's task requires the court to undertake its own independent assessment of the evidence and it further requires the court to determine (at [41]):[41] ... whether, making due allowance for the ""natural limitations"" that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record,13 the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty.
And although ""[n]o single universally applicable description of what constitutes 'no substantial miscarriage of justice' can be given"", it is necessary to bear at the forefront of consideration in this case that, as was pointed out in (at [44]):[44] ... It cannot be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty. [Emphasis added.]
186On the appeal the concession was fairly made by the appellant's counsel that the Crown case against the appellant was strong, gainsaid in my view by the evidence of three co-conspirators and a body of surveillance evidence and pager messages which, taken as a whole, corroborated important aspects of their evidence and which directly implicated the appellant as an organiser and financier of the importation.  After making due allowance for the limitations inherent in appellate review, which in this case involves the question whether, and to what extent, the impugned cross-examination of Potter would have weighed in the jury's consideration, I have resolved to the view that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred.  While I accept that the issue as to whether the appellant was sighted in The Rocks on the evening of 1 June 2003 was significant in the ways discussed at [114]-[115], and that without the impermissible cross-examination the jury may have been left in doubt as to the reliability of the identification evidence, I am persuaded on the considerable and combined weight of the evidence properly admitted at trial (as summarised in [37]-[101] of this judgment) and after considering the appellant's evidence (as summarised at [102]-[113]) that even were there doubts as to whether the appellant was in The Rocks on 1 June 2003 as the Crown alleged, his participation in the conspiracy to import cocaine was proved, and to the criminal standard, such that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred.
187The orders I propose are:1.  Grant leave to extend time for filing the notice of appeal.2.  Appeal against conviction dismissed.

2761259,Inspector Brock v Empire Waste Pty Ltd [2013] NSWDC 38,"RULING
Introduction
1On 1 November 2012 the prosecutor, pursuant to s246 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, applied for an order that Empire Waste Proprietary Limited (the defendant) appear before the Court to answer a charge that on 20 December 2010, contrary to s8(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (OHS Act) it failed to ensure the health and safety and welfare of its employee, Thomas Hill.
2In response to that application, the court ordered that the defendant appear on 14 December 2012 to answer that charge. On 15 November 2012 the defendant filed a Notice of Appearance.
3By Notice of Motion filed 11 February 2013 the defendant seeks orders that the order made by the court, or in the alternative, the proceedings, be quashed, permanently stayed or dismissed upon the following grounds:
(a) That the District Court has no jurisdiction to deal with proceedings for offences against the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000.
(b) That if the court does have jurisdiction, the Application to Commence Proceedings was defective in failing to comply with Part 53 rule 26 of the District Court Rules 1973 because the statement of facts, purportedly in compliance with the rule, included extraneous matters of fact, mixed law and fact, conclusion, comment and opinion.
(c) That, if the Application to Commence Proceedings was not defective for want of compliance with the rule, the court has, and should exercise, a discretion to grant the relief claimed, because the statement of facts has irreparably prejudiced the defendant.
4It is convenient first to address grounds (b) and (c) because they are easily dismissed.
Failing to Comply with Part 53 Rule 26 of the District Court Rules 1973
5The proceedings are before the court pursuant to s246 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. This section relevantly provides:
246 Orders for appearance or apprehension of accused persons 
(1) A prosecutor may apply for an order: 
(a) that a person alleged in the application to have committed an offence that may be dealt with summarily by the court must appear at a time and place specified in the order to answer to the offence charged in the order, or 
(b) 
(2) The application must be in accordance with the rules. 
6Part 53 Rule 26 of the District Court Rules 1973 provides:
53.26 Commencement of proceedings 
(1) Proceedings under section 246 must be commenced in the Court by an application in the approved form for the issue of a summons or for the issue of a warrant for apprehension. 
(2) 
(3) A statement of facts in respect of the offence signed by the prosecutor applying for an order under section 246 is to be lodged with the application. 
(4) 
7The statement of facts lodged with this application contains 41 paragraphs spread over eight pages. The defendant, conceding that the Statement of Facts alleges all the necessary ingredients of the offence, complains that the statement additionally contains arguments and conclusions, and allegations of fact that are irrelevant and prejudicial. I accept that this is so.
8Although the Application to Commence Proceedings must be in an approved form, the content of the Statement of Facts required by rule 26(3) is not governed by any rule or practice note. The expression ""statement of facts"" does not appear either in the District Court Act or otherwise in Part 53.
9It is however implicit in rule 26, and consistent with s246(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act permitting an order to be made in the absence of a defendant, that the purpose of the Statement of Facts is to enable the court to determine whether it should use its coercive powers to order a person to appear to answer a charge (See McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority [2000] NSWCCA 367).
10This purpose is different to the purposes and functions of an indictment or information in the administration of criminal justice identified by Spigelman CJ in Doja v R (2009) NSWCCA 303 as:
(i) Informing the court of the precise identity of the offence with which it is required to deal.
(ii) Providing the accused with the substance of the charge which he or she is called upon to meet, including identification of the essential factual ingredients.
(iii) Enabling the court to ensure that only relevant evidence is admitted and to properly instruct the jury on the relevant law.
(iv) Determining the availability of a plea of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict.
(v) Investing the trial court with jurisdiction to hear and determine the prosecution.
11The Statement of Facts in this case alleges sufficient matters to found jurisdiction. It satisfies rule 26(3). I have no power to set aside the order that the defendant appear to answer the charge. 
Prejudice
12Although I have power to stay the proceedings, this power may only be exercised in circumstances where the defendant is unable to receive a fair trial. In that regard, Gaudron J in Jago v District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 77 said:
18. Another feature attending criminal proceedings and relevant to the grant of a permanent stay thereof is that a trial judge, by reason of the duty to ensure the fairness of a trial, has a number of discretionary powers which may be exercised in the course of a trial, including the power to reject evidence which is technically admissible but which would operate unfairly against the accused. The exercise of the power to reject evidence, either alone or in combination with a trial judge's other powers to control criminal proceedings, will often suffice to remedy any feature of the proceedings which might otherwise render them unjust or unfair. The existence and availability of these powers, when considered in the light of the necessarily limited scope of the power to grant a permanent stay, serve to indicate that a court should have regard to the existence of all its various powers, and should only grant a permanent stay if satisfied that no other means is available to remedy that feature which, if unremedied, would render the proceedings so seriously defective, whether by reason of unfairness, injustice or otherwise, as to demand the grant of a permanent stay.
13The Defendant has not established that the Statement of Facts has caused him irremediable prejudice in obtaining a fair trial.
Jurisdiction
History Of the Legislation
14Before the commencement of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (WHS Act) the District Court did not have jurisdiction to deal with prosecutions for offences against the OHS Act. That jurisdiction was vested by s105 of the OHS Act in the Local Court and the Industrial Relations Commission in Court Session.
15The WHS Act received assent on 7 June 2011 and commenced on 1 January 2012. 
16Section 229B of this Act vested jurisdiction for offences against the Act in the Local Court, and the District Court in its summary jurisdiction.
17Section 276C repealed the OHS Act, and with it s105. Clause 7 of Schedule 4 of the WHS Act made provision for the institution of proceedings for offences against the OHS Act brought after the repeal of that Act.
18The schedule relevantly provided:
Schedule 4 Savings, transitional and other provisions
Part 1 General
1 Regulations
(1) The regulations may contain provisions of a savings or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of the following Acts:
this Act
7 Criminal and other proceedings for offences under OHS Act
(1) Part 13 (Legal proceedings) [which part includes s229 vesting jurisdiction in the Local Court in the District Court] extends (subject to this clause) to proceedings in connection with the OHS Act in relation to offences committed against the OHS Act before its repeal or in relation to any related matter that continues to have force or effect.
(2) This clause applies whether any such proceedings are pending on the repeal of the OHS Act or whether the proceedings are instituted after that repeal.
(3) Part 13 applies with such modifications as are prescribed by the regulations or as are necessary
19On 19 October 2011, Hansard reported the following exchange in parliament:
The Honourable David Clarke: I direct my question to the Minister for Finance and Services. Will the Minister update the House on the transitional arrangements for the courts arising out of the Work Health and Safety Act?

The Honourable Greg Pearce: The transition from the Industrial Court to the District Court has been an important issue and the government wants to provide certainty to all affected parties. All matters currently before the Industrial Court and all matters filed before 31 December 2011, with one exception, are to remain with the Industrial Court. The exception is where the alleged offence was committed after 7 June 2011, the date of assent.
20To effect these transitional arrangements, the Executive on 28 October 2011 published the Work Health and Safety (Savings and Transitional) Regulation 2011. This regulation was to commence on 1 January 2012.
21The Regulation relevantly provided that proceedings for an OHS offence alleged to have been committed before the repeal of the OHS Act were to be dealt with after the repeal of the OHS Act as if that Act had not been repealed. It further provided that proceedings for offences against the OHS Act instituted after the commencement of the WHS Act on 1 January 2012 were to be heard in the District Court or Local Court. 
22The Industrial Court retained jurisdiction in respect of proceedings instituted in that court before the commencement, with the exception of proceedings in respect of offences committed after 7 June 2011 (the date of assent to the WHS Act), which proceedings were to be transferred to the District Court.
23This Regulation was clearly within the power delegated pursuant to Schedule 4 clause 1 and clause 7.
24Unfortunately, shortly after the promulgation of this regulation, Parliament enacted the Work Health and Safety Legislation Amendment Act 2011. This act received assent on 28 November 2011. The act commenced on 1 January 2012.
25This Act omitted clause 7 from Schedule 4, and replaced it with a presently irrelevant provision authorising the continuance of regulations made under the OHS Act.
26One month later, on 16 December 2011, the Executive published the Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011 vesting jurisdiction to deal with OHS prosecutions in the District Court and Local Court.
27This Regulation repealed the Work Health and Safety (Savings and Transitional) Regulation 2011 and provided:
SCHEDULE 18B - Savings and transitional provisions 
Part 2 - Prosecution of offences against OHS laws 
2 General transitional arrangements for OHS offences 
Proceedings for an OHS offence alleged to have been committed before the repeal of the OHS Act are to be dealt with after the repeal of the OHS Act as if that Act had not been repealed, except as otherwise provided by this Part. 
3 Arrangements for proceedings commenced after WHS Act commencement 
Proceedings for an OHS offence that are commenced after the commencement of the WHS Act are to be dealt with as follows: 
(a) proceedings are to be dealt with summarily before the Local Court or the District Court in its summary jurisdiction, except as provided by paragraph (b), 
(b) proceedings for an offence against section 32A (Reckless conduct causing death at workplace by person with OHS duties) of the OHS Act are to be taken on indictment.
The Problem
28In the absence of the former clause 7 of Schedule 4, the Act does not expressly confer upon the Executive a power to invest jurisdiction in the District Court and the Local Court to entertain OHS prosecutions.
29Section 276 of the Act, the general regulatory power, relevantly provides:
276 Regulation-making powers 
(1) The Governor may make regulations in relation to: 
(a) any matter relating to work health and safety, and 
(b) any matter or thing required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed or that is necessary or convenient to be prescribed to give effect to this Act.
30Schedule 4, amended by the Work Health and Safety Legislation Amendment Act 2011 relevantly provides only that:
Part 1 - General 
1 Regulations 
(1) The regulations may contain provisions of a savings or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of the following Acts: 
this Act. 
The Defendant's Submissions
The Sufficiency of Power
31The defendant first contends that by reason of want of sufficient enabling power in the Work Health and Safety Act 2011, to the extent that clause 3 of Schedule 18B purports to vest jurisdiction in the District Court to hear prosecutions under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (repealed) it is invalid.
32In the defendant's submission an intention to delegate to the Executive the power to confer jurisdiction on a Court will not be attributed to the Parliament without that intention being spelt out in clear language in the enabling Act. Such an intention cannot be inferred from a general regulation making power (Ex parte McGuigan [1923] WN (NSW) 129, Willocks v Anderson 124 CLR 293, The Retirement Benefits Board v Hingston [1997] TASSC 66). 
33In Ex parte McGuigan, Ferguson J (with whom Campbell J and Ralston AJ concurred) said: 
The power to make regulations is given by s51 of the Act which empowers the Governor-General to make regulations, not inconsistent with the Act, prescribing all matters, which by the Act are required or permitted to be prescribed, or which are necessary or convenient to be prescribed for giving effect to this Act. Section 30 enables powers to be conferred by regulation upon the Commissioner in the event of a purchaser making default under his contract, but does not authorise the making of regulations, conferring jurisdiction upon a Court. The regulation in question if it is valid, confers upon a Court a jurisdiction which hitherto it did not possess, and there is nothing in the Act which authorises that jurisdiction to be conferred by regulation 
34In Willocks v Anderson the Court, per Barwick CJ, Menzies, Windeyer, Owen, Walsh and Gibbs JJ, held that the ""necessary and convenient"" regulation making power in the Apple and Pear Organisation Act 1936, (in similar terms to the power considered in Ex parte McGuigan) did not contemplate that jurisdiction may be conferred on the court by regulation. At 299-300 the Court said:
Even if the power to do so [confer original jurisdiction on the Court] may be validly delegated to the Governor-General it is not a matter to be left to the initiative of the Executive except after that attention has been given to the question by the Parliament. If after such consideration the Parliament for reasons sufficiently compelling in a particular case should decide to delegate the power, its intention to do so should be expressly and clearly stated. It cannot be held that the Parliament intended that the time of this Court should be taken up in hearing in its original jurisdiction appeals against elections to commodity boards, such as the Australian Apple and Pear Board, without a clear and unmistakable expression of such an intention. General words should not readily be construed as expressing the necessary intention. Neither in s. 27, nor elsewhere in the provisions of the Act, is there to be found any expression of an intention that original jurisdiction under the Act should be conferred on this Court, nor is there anything in the Act from which the existence of such an intention can be implied. It follows that if Parliament has power to authorize the making of the regulations contained in Pt VI it has not exercised that power. The regulations in Pt VI are therefore ultra vires and invalid and there is no jurisdiction to hear and determine the petition now before the Court.
35In The Retirement Benefits Board v Hingston, Underwood J in the Supreme Court of Tasmania, after citing to this passage, said: 
Of course, Willocks v Anderson (supra) concerned an attempt to confer jurisdiction by regulation on the High Court, but the principle expressed in the above cited passage is equally applicable to purported Parliamentary authorisation for the Executive to confer jurisdiction on any State court of plenary jurisdiction. In the absence of clear unambiguous words, an intention to delegate to the Executive the power to confer jurisdiction on the Supreme Court will not be attributed to the Parliament. Such an intention certainly cannot be spelled out of a general regulation making power.
36The defendant contrasts the general expression of powers in Schedule 4 clause 1 with the specific conferring of power seen in Clause 14 of Schedule 3 that includes within the regulation making powers of that Schedule the following:
14 Review of decisions 
Matters relating to the review of decisions under the regulations including: 
(a) prescribing decisions as reviewable decisions for the purposes of Part 12 or for the purposes of the regulations, and 
(b) prescribing procedures for internal and external review of decisions under the regulations, and 
(c) conferring jurisdiction on the Local Court or the Industrial Relations Commission to conduct reviews under the regulations. 
37The defendant also relies upon the enactment by Parliament of the Work Health and Safety Legislation Amendment Act 2011 which Act repealed clause 7 of Schedule 4 that had specifically invested the District Court and the Local Court with jurisdiction to entertain OHS prosecutions.
38Parliament is presumed to have taken this step in the knowledge that the Industrial Court would otherwise retain transitional jurisdiction to deal with these matters pursuant to s30 of Interpretation Act 1987.
39This circumstance gives rise to a strong inference that Parliament had changed its mind, and intended that the District Court and Local Court should not exercise jurisdiction over OHS prosecutions, but rather the Industrial Court should exercise a residual jurisdiction over these matters.
Schedule 4 Clause 1(5)
40Secondly the defendant submits that even if the regulatory powers conferred by s276 and Schedule 4 of the Act validly enabled clauses 1 to 4 of Schedule 18B of the Regulation, that Regulation could not have effect beyond 31 December 2012 because of the operation of Schedule 4 clause 1(5), which was inserted in the Act by the Work Health and Safety Legislation Amendment Act 2011.
41This provision reads as follows:
(5) The power to make regulations under subclause (1) extends to authorise the making of regulations whereby the provisions of this Act are deemed to be amended in a specified manner, but any regulation made pursuant to this subclause: 
(a) may only be made for or with respect to matters for or with respect to which this Act makes provision, and 
(b) may not be made so as to have effect after 31 December 2012, and 
(c) ceases to have effect, unless sooner revoked or otherwise ceasing to have effect, on 31 December 2012. 
42This argument proceeds upon the basis that clause 2 of Schedule 18B amends s229B(1) of the WHS Act by expanding the ambit of that section to confer jurisdiction on the District Court to deal with offences against the OHS Act.
43I do not believe that this submission has any substance. The Regulation does not purport to deem that [s229B] be amended in a specified manner. That section continues to operate in its terms.
44It seems to me that the purpose of subclause 5 is to permit a rapid regulatory response to unforeseen problems in the operation of the savings and transitional provisions of the new Act, with the intention that Parliament would, within a short time, consider and enact the appropriate legislative remedy. 
The Interpretation Act 1987
45Thirdly, the defendant submits that clause 3 of Schedule 18B, by removing the jurisdiction of the Industrial Court to continue to hear OHS prosecutions that would otherwise continue pursuant to s30 of the Interpretation Act 1987, attempts to amend the operation of that Act, and this cannot be done by regulation.
46Section 30 of the Interpretation Act 1987 relevantly provides that:
30 Effect of amendment or repeal of Acts and statutory rules 
(1) The amendment or repeal of an Act or statutory rule does not: 
(e) affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability or penalty, 
and any such penalty may be imposed and enforced, and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, as if the Act or statutory rule had not been amended or repealed. 
47The defendant's submission ignores s5(2) of the Act that provides:
5 Application of Act 
(2) This Act applies to an Act or instrument except in so far as the contrary intention appears in this Act or in the Act or instrument concerned. 
48This submission is also without substance.
The Prosecutor's Submissions 
The Sufficiency of Power
49The prosecutor submits that the authorities upon which the defendant relies are distinguishable because clauses 2 and 3 of Schedule 18B do not rely upon the general regulatory power of s276, but rather upon the more focused power to enact regulations of a savings or transitional nature, contained within Schedule 4 Clause 1.
50In Australian Meat Industry Employees Union v Hamberger [2000] FCA 1197 Beaumont, Lee and Gyles JJ said:
Where an Act fails to include a transitional provision, which regulates the coming into operation of the enactment and (where necessary) modifies its effect during the period of transition, or where the Act includes an inadequate transitional provision, the Court is required to draw such inferences as to the intended transitional arrangements as, in the light of the interpretive criteria, it considers Parliament to have intended.
One feature of a transitional provision is that its operation is expected to be temporary , in that it becomes spent when all the past circumstances with which it is designed to deal have been dealt with.
As Nourse J said Inland Revenue Commissioners v Metrolands (Properly Finance) Ltd [1981] 1 WLR 637 at 649:
""One thing which is clear about [s45] (4) and (8), is that the former is a permanent provision and the latter is a transitional one... it would be very dangerous, in trying to get to the effect of the permanent provision to attach too much weight to the particular wording of the transitional one""
51The intentions of Parliament in relation to transitional measures may be different to its intentions in relation to the enduring effects of permanent provisions. The necessary intention in relation to transitional measures may be inferred from the legislative scheme and other circumstances rather than found in the clear and unmistakable expression of ...intention required by Willlocks. 
52The chronology of the legislative changes reveals a Parliamentary intention that the Executive by regulation confer jurisdiction on the District Court to deal with OHS prosecutions.
53On 7 June 2011 The WHS Act received assent. This act was to commence on January 2012. Within Schedule 4, Clause 7 expressly conferred jurisdiction upon the Local Court and the District Court to deal with OHS prosecutions.
54Clause 1 of Schedule 4 authorised regulations of a savings or transitional nature that may concern this jurisdiction. 
55On 28 October 2011 the Executive, exercising the power conferred by Clause 1, published the Work Health and Safety (Savings and Transitional) Regulation 2011. This regulation also expressly conferred jurisdiction on the District Court. It read as follows: 
2 Commencement 
This Regulation commences on the commencement of the WHS Act. 
5 Arrangements for proceedings commenced after WHS Act commencement 
Proceedings for an OHS offence that are commenced after the commencement of the WHS Act are to be dealt with as follows: 
(a) proceedings are to be dealt with summarily before the Local Court or the District Court in its summary jurisdiction, except as provided by paragraph (b), 
(b) proceedings for an offence against section 32A (Reckless conduct causing death at workplace by person with OHS duties) of the OHS Act are to be taken on indictment.
56On 28 November 2011 the Work Health and Safety Legislation Amendment Act 2011 received assent. 
57When passing that Act the Legislature knew that the District Court was already, pursuant to clause 5 of the properly enabled Work Health and Safety (Savings and Transitional) Regulation 2011, expressly vested with jurisdiction to hear OHS prosecutions upon commencement of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011.
58It is not surprising then, that the Legislature in passing the Amending Act deleted the original and enabling clause 7 of Schedule 4, believing that it was redundant because clause 5 of the existing Regulation provided to the same effect. The Legislature could not have foreseen the next event.
59On 16 December 2011 the Executive published the Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011. This regulation unnecessarily and absurdly repealed the expressly authorised transitional provisions in clause 5 vesting jurisdiction in the District Court, and, without express authority, replaced them, in precisely the same terms, with clauses 2 and 3 of Schedule 18B of the Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011 as follows:
2 General transitional arrangements for OHS offences 
3 Arrangements for proceedings commenced after WHS Act commencement 
Proceedings for an OHS offence that are commenced after the commencement of the WHS Act are to be dealt with as follows: 
(a) proceedings are to be dealt with summarily before the Local Court or the District Court in its summary jurisdiction, except as provided by paragraph (b), 
(b) proceedings for an offence against section 32A (Reckless conduct causing death at workplace by person with OHS duties) of the OHS Act are to be taken on indictment. 
60Compare these words with the words contained within paragraph 55 above.
61The intention of Parliament that the District Court be invested with jurisdiction to entertain OHS prosecutions is quite plainly spelt out in this sequence. The parliamentary intention did not change. Any confusion is the result of Executive oversight.
Conclusion
62I accept the submissions of the prosecutor. I find that clauses 2 and 3 of Schedule 18B of the Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011 are valid regulations enabled by clause 1 of Schedule 4 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011.

		16 April 2013",2013-04-11 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761277,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Soliman [2013] NSWSC 346,"JUDGMENT

1The plaintiff has appealed pursuant to s 56(1)(c) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 against a dismissal of a number of charges alleged to have been committed by the first defendant. That dismissal was effected pursuant to s 32 (""the section"") of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act""). The foundation of the appeal is the proposition that the reasons given for the dismissal by the learned Magistrate were inadequate. The orders sought are that the order dismissing the matters be quashed, and that the matter be returned to the Local Court for further hearing. Prerogative relief is sought in the alternative.

2The second defendant has entered a submitting appearance. For ease of comprehension, I shall refer to the plaintiff as the prosecutor, and the first defendant as the defendant.

3At the hearing, it was made clear that costs were not sought by the prosecutor. 

Threshold question

4Counsel for the defendant accepted that at least one error had been made by the Magistrate, and that the orders sought by the prosecutor should be made. He disagreed, however, with some of the specific written submissions of counsel for the prosecutor.

5In that context, I queried with the parties whether it would be appropriate for me to deliver a judgment. I was concerned not only about the appropriate use of court resources in a matter that had been ""settled"", but also whether there was in truth a dispute before the Court requiring resolution by me.

6Counsel for the prosecutor referred me to a number of decisions of this Court in appeals brought from the Local Court pursuant to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act in which, despite the concurrence of the parties as to disposition and orders, nevertheless a judgment had been delivered. He referred in particular to the decisions of Adams J in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Dewes [2008] NSWSC 1141 and Simpson J in Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions v Seymour [2009] NSWSC 555. He also invited my attention to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Fang v R [2010] NSWCCA 254. He submitted that that case is an example of that Court delivering a judgment with regard to a ground of appeal against conviction that had been the subject of a concession by the Crown.

7He also submitted that it would be odd for the matter to be remitted to the Local Court for further hearing without any guidance from this Court as to the error that is said to have been made.

8Counsel for the defendant did not wish to be heard on the issue.

9I accept the submissions of counsel for the prosecutor. I consider it appropriate that, despite the concurrence of the parties, I deliver a judgment expressing my own determination. In light of the fact that error is accepted and the orders sought in the appeal are not opposed by counsel for the defendant, my judgment will of course be shorter than if there had been a full-blown controversy between the parties.

Chronological background

10The allegation of the prosecutor is that, on 28 June 2011, the defendant was stopped by police after driving at 123 km/h in a 70 km/h zone. There ensued a high-speed chase. Eventually he was arrested at his home, and thereafter it is alleged that he behaved abusively and violently towards the police.

11As a result of those allegations, the defendant was issued with court attendance notices for: one charge of exceeding the speed limit by more than 45 km/h; one charge of driving without a license; one charge of not stopping a vehicle when directed to do so by police; two charges of assaulting police officers; one charge of offensive language; and one charge of resisting a police officer.

12The proceedings were adjourned a number of times. On 23 January 2012, the matter came before the Magistrate who ultimately determined the matter. On that occasion, the solicitor then appearing for the defendant indicated there would be an application pursuant to the section with regard to some of the charges. With regard to others, a voir dire was sought with an eye to exclusion pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995. That voir dire was conducted on that date, but the application to exclude the evidence was rejected.

13Subsequently, the proceedings were adjourned on a number of further occasions, including before a different magistrate.

14The application to dismiss pursuant to the section was ultimately made on 19 June 2012.

Hearing on 19 June 2012

15A transcript of the proceedings on 19 June 2012 formed part of the material before me on the appeal.

16Proceedings commenced with counsel then acting for the defendant handing up ""some documents"". Although the transcript does not record which documents they were, it seems from an examination of the file undertaken by the solicitor for the prosecutor that they were a report from Dr Edwards, psychiatrist; two letters from Mr Brown, social worker; and one letter from Dr Erian, general practitioner. 

17To state their import with great succinctness, in a report dated 4 June 2012, Dr Edwards, who treated the defendant as a consulting psychiatrist, diagnosed the defendant as suffering from schizophrenia, depression and substance dependence. Dr Edwards noted that the stabilisation of the defendant had been somewhat complicated by poor compliance with treatment plans on the part of the defendant. Furthermore, Dr Edwards suggested that, due to a concerted effort on the part of the defendant's case manager, treating psychiatrist and the staff at the Drug Health Service, the condition of the defendant had shown some improvement over the previous 12 months. 

18A report prepared by Mr Brown, the social worker, referred to discussions with Dr Edwards confirming the necessity of continued medication in stabilising the mental health of the defendant. Mr Brown further noted that the defendant had been dealing with his condition by way of continued counselling. 

19Finally, a report dated 15 May 2012 and prepared by Dr Erian discussed a history of heroin and cannabis abuse that had improved. With regard to mental health conditions, Dr Erian noted that the defendant was suffering from anxiety and depression, but was not able to confirm whether the defendant suffered from drug induced psychosis or schizophrenia. 

20After the receipt of the documents, the transcript then records the following:

""HIS HONOUR: What we've got here doesn't really get us over the hurdle--

KRISENTHAL [counsel for the defendant]: Well a combination of things. It has gone over for a number of times and I've had difficulties in obtaining a report from the treating specialist but the report from Dr Edwards, he is a treating specialist in my submission. He's treated my client for the last four years and he confirms that my client suffers from schizophrenia, depression, as well as substance abuse and that at the relevant period, that is June 2011, that he was--

HIS HONOUR: Dr Edwards begins his remarks by saying he's not the treating psychiatrist and secondly, I'd be the first to say, this is probably a case where a s 32 might apply but what we need is to do the drill which is to have a treatment plan which says who he is going to see and what drugs he is going to be on although it says that he does take some drugs in that report and then an undertaking by somebody engaged in the treatment to report a breach of the order.

KRISENTHAL: And that is there, the third last page, from Ian Brown dated 3 April this year, that Andrew is a client of his. He is the case manager and that he is willing to accept care and follow-up of him on a s 32 and to report to the court if there is no compliance.

HIS HONOUR: What do you say? Do you say the treatment plan is in fact Ian Brown's statement on the first page of his letter?

KRISENTHAL: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: What's happened to the application for a community treatment order?

KRISENTHAL: There's no community treatment order in place at present but he sees Ian Brown and is in receipt of medication and that is confirmed by Dr Edwards when he talks about, in the paragraph, there's been a concerted effort on the part of his case manager, treating psychiatrist and the staff at Drug Health Services and he has managed to improve somewhat in the last 12 months. I agree that it's not all on one document.

HIS HONOUR: Is there any way you can get it all together?

KRISENTHAL: I've had difficulties your Honour in obtaining that information. We've approached Dr Nataraj, we've approached the Fairfield Community Health Centre and I've got what I've got at this stage. But in my submission the combination of the material before you shows that there is a treatment plan, that he's receiving medication. Mr Brown is prepared to accept him on a s 32 and to notify the court if he doesn't accept it. Additional, Dr Samiarian(?), and that's the--

HIS HONOUR: I'll write the treatment plan. He is one, to continue--

PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, the prosecution are opposed. The ..(not transcribable).. required a detailed treatment plan. This isn't detailed, it's just to follow up at a later date. That's not a treatment plan your Honour. I also say that two of these documents aren't signed and your Honour could have no regard for them. And these are serious driving matters that have put the public at serious risk. A s 32 isn't going to diminish that risk considering he's already been on treatment for some time.""

21Thereafter the matter was stood in the list.

22When the matter was revisited, the following exchange took place between his Honour and the prosecutor in the Local Court:

""HIS HONOUR: Well sergeant, in the matter of Soliman, if I make the treatment order, that is to undertake counselling with the Corella Drug and Alcohol team and the Fairfield Mental Health team plus he continues the medication which is Effexor and Solian and that we accept the undertaking of Mr Brown.

PROSECUTOR: But isn't the point that psychologists are meant to come up with a treatment plan that's to address the re-offending. With respect, your Honour is not a psychologist so doesn't know what's required for the treatment plan.

HIS HONOUR: Well the treatment plan is he gets counselling and he attends on the Fairfield Mental Health team and that he complies with the medication which is Effexor and Solian.

PROSECUTOR: As the court please.

HIS HONOUR: That should do and in any event it looks as though there will be a community treatment order as well in which case the matter will probably come out of our hands in the end.

PROSECUTOR: As the court please."" 

23At the end of the matter, his Honour made the following order:

""THE TREATMENT PLAN IS TO CONTINUE, COUNSELLING AT CORELLA AND FAIRFIELD MENTAL HEALTH TEAM AND HE IS TO COMPLY WITH HIS MEDICATION AND I NOTE THE UNDERTAKING OF IAN BROWN."" 

24Finally, a written order issued from the Local Court Registry in compliance with the terms of s 32 of the Act.

25I am informed by the parties that the defendant has been subject to those orders of his Honour since that time.

Legislation 

26It is convenient at this stage to set out the provision said to provide the power of the prosecutor to appeal, along with the provision that provides a magistrate with the power to dismiss a matter in certain circumstances.

27Section 56 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act is as follows:

""56 Appeals as of right

(1) The prosecutor may appeal to the Supreme Court against:

(a) a sentence imposed by the Local Court in any summary proceedings, or
(b) an order made by the Local Court that stays any summary proceedings for the prosecution of an offence, or
(c) an order made by the Local Court dismissing a matter the subject of any summary proceedings, or
(d) an order for costs made by a Magistrate against the prosecutor in any committal proceedings, or
(e) an order for costs made by the Local Court against the prosecutor in any summary proceedings,

other than an order or sentence with respect to an environmental offence, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone.

(2) An appeal must be made within such period after the date of the sentence or order as may be prescribed by rules of court."" (emphasis added)

28Section 32 of the Act is as follows:

""32 Persons suffering from mental illness or condition

(1) If, at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a Magistrate, it appears to the Magistrate:

(a) that the defendant is (or was at the time of the alleged commission of the offence to which the proceedings relate):

(i) developmentally disabled, or
(ii) suffering from mental illness, or
(iii) suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a mental health facility,

but is not a mentally ill person, and

(b) that, on an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the Magistrate may consider relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law,

the Magistrate may take the action set out in subsection (2) or (3).

(2) The Magistrate may do any one or more of the following:

(a) adjourn the proceedings,
(b) grant the defendant bail in accordance with the Bail Act 1978,
(c) make any other order that the Magistrate considers appropriate.

(3) The Magistrate may make an order dismissing the charge and discharge the defendant:

(a) into the care of a responsible person, unconditionally or subject to conditions, or
(b) on the condition that the defendant attend on a person or at a place specified by the Magistrate for assessment of the defendant's mental condition or treatment or both, or
(c) unconditionally.

(3A) If a Magistrate suspects that a defendant subject to an order under subsection (3) may have failed to comply with a condition under that subsection, the Magistrate may, within 6 months of the order being made, call on the defendant to appear before the Magistrate.

(3B) If the defendant fails to appear, the Magistrate may:

(a) issue a warrant for the defendant's arrest, or
(b) authorise an authorised officer within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to issue a warrant for the defendant's arrest.

(3C) If, however, at the time the Magistrate proposes to call on a defendant referred to in subsection (3A) to appear before the Magistrate, the Magistrate is satisfied that the location of the defendant is unknown, the Magistrate may immediately:

(a) issue a warrant for the defendant's arrest, or
(b) authorise an authorised officer within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to issue a warrant for the defendant's arrest.

(3D) If a Magistrate discharges a defendant subject to a condition under subsection (3), and the defendant fails to comply with the condition within 6 months of the discharge, the Magistrate may deal with the charge as if the defendant had not been discharged.

(4) A decision under this section to dismiss charges against a defendant does not constitute a finding that the charges against the defendant are proven or otherwise.

(4A) A Magistrate is to state the reasons for making a decision as to whether or not a defendant should be dealt with under subsection (2) or (3).

(4B) A failure to comply with subsection (4A) does not invalidate any decision of a Magistrate under this section.

(5) The regulations may prescribe the form of an order under this section.""

Grounds

29Originally, the following six grounds were notified: 

(1)""Failure to make any findings as to whether and why the First defendant was eligible to be dealt with under s 32 of the MHFP Act 1990;

(2)Failing to make any findings as to whether it was more appropriate to deal with the First defendant under the provisions of Part 3 of the MHFP Act 1990;

(3)Failing to have regard to the seriousness of the offences;

(4)Failing to provide adequate reasons for his determination to deal with the First defendant in accordance with the provisions of Part 3 of the MHFP Act;

(5)Failing to provide adequate reasons for his determination to dismiss the charges pursuant to s 32 of the MHFP Act; and

(6)Dismissing the charges pursuant to s 32 of the MHFP Act 1990.""

30At the hearing, counsel for the prosecutor submitted that, in the circumstances, there were three asserted errors with which my judgment should deal. They were ground one (the asserted failure of his Honour to make a finding as to whether and why the defendant came within the section as a threshold question); ground two (the asserted failure to make finding as to whether it was more appropriate to deal with the defendant under the section); and ground four (an asserted failure to give adequate reasons).

Submissions by the prosecutor

31Generally, counsel for the prosecutor submitted that the determination of the matter undertaken by his Honour did not comply with the steps called for by the section, as elucidated by the judgments in Director of Public Prosecutions v El Mawas [2006] NSWCA 154; (2006) 66 NSWLR 93. He respectfully submitted that the transcript demonstrates that there was no real judgment at all delivered in the matter, merely a series of exchanges between the Bench and the Bar table.

32He emphasised the opposition expressed by the then prosecutor to the making of an order. That was founded on three bases: the seriousness of at least some of the offences, which were said to ""have put the public at serious risk""; the submission that an order under the section would not help; and the submission that there was no suitable treatment plan. He submitted that, in those circumstances there should not only have been a judgment, but also one that resolved, even if briefly, the contentions of the parties.

33He submitted that it is not appropriate, in the absence of a judgment, for an appellate court to be required to analyse the exchanges between the Bench and Bar table in order to understand what was in the mind of a judicial officer. He referred to the judgment of Johnson J in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited [2006] NSWSC 343; 67 NSWLR 402.

34He also submitted that the giving of reasons for orders, be they ever so brief, is an essential part of the exercise of judicial function. He referred to the well-known statement of McHugh JA in Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 279A:

""[W]ithout the articulation of reasons, a judicial decision cannot be distinguished from an arbitrary decision. In my opinion the giving of reasons is correctly perceived as 'a necessary incident of the judicial process'"".

35Quite apart from this particular case, I sought his submissions as to what a judgment with regard to the section should generally contain. 

36He accepted the great time pressures under which magistrates sitting in the criminal jurisdiction operate. He also accepted that it is not appropriate to be overly prescriptive as to the bare minimum of what such a judgment should contain, in light of the multitude of circumstances that could give rise to an application for dismissal under the section. And he accepted that much will depend upon the matters that are truly in dispute between the parties when such an order is sought.

37However, he submitted that it will very often be necessary for a magistrate to express a satisfaction that a defendant, whether at the time of the alleged offence or at the time of the hearing, possesses one of the three attributes identified in s 32(1)(a).

38Secondly, he submitted that it will also very often be necessary for a magistrate to express a satisfaction that the test contained in s 32(1)(b) has been made out. In other words, it would at least be appropriate to express a satisfaction that a defendant would more appropriately be dealt with pursuant to the section rather than by way of ordinary operation of the criminal law, even if a magistrate does not explain why. 

39Thirdly, he submitted that in light of the judgment of Howie J in Confos v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2004] NSWSC 1159, it will very often be appropriate for a magistrate to demonstrate that the seriousness of the alleged offences has been taken into account in that balancing exercise.

40Fourthly, he submitted that it will, in some circumstances, be appropriate to indicate why orders pursuant to s 32(2), as opposed to s 32(3), are to be made.

41In short, whilst accepting the pressures under which magistrates sitting in the criminal jurisdiction operate, and acknowledging the body of law in support of the proposition that analysis of the sufficiency of a judgment provided in such circumstances should be undertaken in a commonsense way, he nevertheless submitted that what occurred in this matter was erroneous. More generally, he submitted that it would be appropriate for me to provide respectful guidance to magistrates as to the sufficiency of judgments in applications for orders pursuant to this section.

Submissions of defence counsel

42As I have indicated, counsel for the defendant did not dispute that error had been established, and that the orders sought by the prosecutor should be made. In particular he generally accepted that there was nothing to indicate that the balancing exercise in s 32(1)(b) had been undertaken. 

43With regard to more general considerations, he generally agreed with the submissions of counsel for the prosecutor as to the essential requirements of judgments with regard to such applications. However, he sounded a number of notes of caution.

44First, he submitted that, with regard to the jurisdictional question, (namely whether the a defendant falls within s 32(1)(a)), on the evidence it may be so overwhelmingly clear that that is so, that a failure to express a satisfaction about it would not constitute an error on the part of a magistrate. 

45He suggested that the current case provided an example, in that there was no evidence to the contrary of the proposition that the defendant was suffering from depression and schizophrenia, and the prosecutor in the Local Court did not oppose the making of the order on that basis. 

46Secondly, he submitted that, in many cases, it would not be incumbent upon a magistrate to indicate why orders were to be made under s 32(3) as opposed to s 32(2).

47Thirdly, he submitted more generally that each case will turn on its own facts, not only with regard to evidence, but also with regard to the matters, if any, in dispute between the parties. As a result, he also submitted that anything I say should not be overly prescriptive.

Determination

48I respectfully agree with counsel for the parties that an order dismissing a matter under s 32 of the Act is an order for the purposes of s 56 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.

49I also consider that the asserted inadequacy of reasons given by a judicial officer is a question of law that gives rise to the power of appeal relied upon by the prosecutor. 

50I also respectfully agree that error has been established by the prosecutor. I consider that in this case there was a requirement to deliver a judgment, albeit a brief one, that engaged with the tests contained in the section. That was especially the case in light of the clear opposition by the then prosecutor to the making of the order, and the fact that that opposition was based upon three discrete aspects of the evidence.

51Furthermore, I consider that the proceedings generally suffer from the vice identified in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited, in that in order to attempt to construe what was taken into account by the learned Magistrate, one is required to peruse the transcript of submissions and discussion.

52I respectfully consider, in particular, that the reasons given with regard to the balancing test in the section were inadequate. 

53It follows that I shall make the two orders sought by the prosecutor and agreed to by the defendant.

54I accept the submission of counsel for the prosecutor that it is appropriate for me to say something about judgments with regard to applications under the section.

55As I indicated in ACP v Munro [2012] NSWSC 1510 at [109], I am aware from my own experience of the pace and pressure that attaches to the disposition of criminal matters in the Local Court. And I can say from my own judicial experience that, if judges of this Court sitting in the bails list were required to deliver disquisitions on the regime of presumptions for or against bail, or the multitude of factors enumerated in s 32 of the Bail Act 1978, that part of the machinery of criminal justice would simply seize up.

56Furthermore, I respectfully agree with both counsel that the requirements of a judgment in an application under the section will very much depend upon the circumstances, and therefore one should be careful not to be overly prescriptive. For example, if the prosecutor is in full agreement with the making of an order, then the judgment may well be substantially shorter than if there is extensive dispute. If the evidence is overwhelming with regard to the jurisdictional question, then a magistrate may need to take very little time with it. And if an offence is self-evidently trivial, there may be little need to analyse its seriousness at length.

57Bearing those two notes of caution in mind, I consider that, in many applications pursuant to this section, it would be appropriate for a magistrate to express very briefly his or her finding as to whether a defendant falls within s 32(1)(a). It will also often be appropriate to indicate within which subparagraph a defendant falls.

58I also consider that, in many if not most applications under the section, it would be appropriate for a magistrate to indicate that he or she has considered the balancing test contained in s 32(1)(b).

59And in light of what was said by Smart J in Perry v Forbes (unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, 21 May 1993) at [48] of the judgment; by Howie J in Confos v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) at [17]; by Spigelman CJ in Director of Public Prosecutions v El Mawas at [17]; by McColl JA in the same case at [77]; by Adams J in Mantell v Molyneux [2006] NSWSC 955; (2006) 165 A Crim R 83 at [40]; and by Hall J in Khalil v His Honour, Magistrate Johnson [2008] NSWSC 1092 at [85(7)], I consider that a magistrate should indicate in a judgment that refers to that balancing exercise that the seriousness of the offence has been taken into account.

60Finally, in the judgment as to whether or not to make an order, I consider that it often would be appropriate to discuss, albeit briefly, what is proposed by way of assistance and treatment with regard to a defendant, and the reason why such a course is to be adopted or rejected.

61To be clear, I am thinking in the usual course of a judgment that is to be measured in several sentences, not several paragraphs or several pages of transcript.

Orders

62I make the following orders:

(1)Appeal allowed.

(2)The order of the Magistrate dismissing the matter is set aside.

(3)The matter is remitted to the Local Court for further hearing.

2761285,Adam Jolly v R [2013] NSWCCA 76,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Bellew J and the orders which he proposes.

2SLATTERY J:I agree with Bellew J.

3BELLEW J: On 2 April 2012, following pleas of guilty entered in the Local Court, the applicant appeared for sentence before her Honour Judge English in the District Court in respect of the following:


(i)one count of attempted sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years (Crimes Act 1900 s. 66B) (""count 1"");
(ii)two counts of aggravated indecent assault of a person under the age of 16 years (Crimes Act 1900 s. 61M(2) (""counts 2 and 5"");
(iii)one count of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years (Crimes Act 1900 s. 66A(2) (""count 3"");
(iv)one count of detaining for advantage (Crimes Act 1900 S. 86(1)(b) (""count 4"").

4 Her Honour sentenced the applicant as follows:


(i)in respect of count 1, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 years commencing on 25 February 2011 and expiring on 24 February 2023, with a balance of term of 5 years commencing on 25 February 2023 and expiring on 24 February 2028;


(ii)in respect of each of counts 2 and 5, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 25 August 2010 and expiring on 24 August 2014, with a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 25 August 2014 and expiring on 24 August 2016; 


(iii)in respect of count 3, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 15 years commencing on 25 May 2011 and expiring on 24 May 2026 with a balance of term of 7 years commencing on 25 May 2026 and expiring on 24 May 2033;


(iv)in respect of count 4, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 25 November 2010 and expiring on 24 November 2016, with a balance of term of 3 years commencing on 25 November 2016 and expiring on 24 November 2019.

5The total overall sentence imposed upon the applicant was a non-parole period of 15 years and 9 months commencing on 25 August 2010 and expiring on 24 May 2026, with a balance of term of 7 years commencing on 25 May 2026 expiring on 24 May 2033. 

6The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed, upon the grounds more fully set out below.

THE FACTS
7The agreed facts set out by the sentencing judge (commencing at AB 11) may be summarised as follows.

8At about 11.30 am on Sunday 14 February 2010, SS (""the complainant"") who was then aged 6 years, was riding her scooter outside the front of her residence at Mount Austin whilst her mother was inside. She went into the front yard of the premises and whilst she was sitting on the front steps, the applicant approached her and said:

""Is your mum home?""

9The applicant then picked up the complainant and carried her to his vehicle which was parked nearby. The complainant screamed loudly, her screams alerting her mother, as well as an off duty police officer who was inside premises nearby. 

10The applicant placed SS in the rear of his vehicle, a dual cab utility, and got into the driver's seat. As he drove off at high speed, the complainant's mother grabbed on to the rear of the vehicle, but could not maintain her grip and fell to the roadway. She was able to discern two letters from the registration plate on the vehicle and police were immediately notified.

11The applicant then drove the complainant to two semi rural locations in and around Wagga Wagga where the offences were committed in the following sequence. 

Count 2 - Aggravated indecent assault
12At the first location to which the applicant took the complainant, which was a public reserve, the complainant spat on her hands and placed them on the applicant's erect penis. A mixture of the DNA of the complainant and the applicant was found on the left and right hands of the complainant.

13The applicant was disturbed by the arrival of a nearby resident, a Mr Connors, who recorded the registration number of the applicant's vehicle which he provided to police some days later upon hearing a report of the complainant's abduction.



Count 1 - Attempted sexual intercourse with a child under 10
14After being disturbed at the first location, the applicant drove the complainant to another. Upon arrival, he and the complainant left his vehicle and, at the applicant's direction, the complainant removed her clothing and lay down on her back in the grass. The offender removed his clothing and lay down on top of the complainant whereupon he attempted to forcibly penetrate her vagina with his penis. He desisted when the complainant told him that it hurt. 

Count 5 - Aggravated indecent assault
15At some point at the second location, the applicant rubbed his erect penis on the bare bottom of the complainant.

Count 3 - Aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under 10
16The offender then inserted his penis into the mouth of the complainant, who performed fellatio upon him. 

Count 4 - Detain for advantage
17Following the commission of the offence in count 3, the complainant and the applicant put their clothing back on and got back into the applicant's vehicle. At about 12.50 pm, the applicant dropped the complainant at a location near her home, saying to her:

""You can walk from here"".

18The complainant walked home where she was met by her mother and police, at which time she said:

""He made me touch his doodle"".

19The applicant's detention of the complainant between about 11.30 am and 12.50 pm as outlined above formed the basis of count 4.

Events subsequent to the applicant's offending
20Upon her arrival at home, the clothing which had been worn by the complainant was seized by police, and she was conveyed to hospital for examination. Due to the fact that the only available attending doctor was a male, a forensic examination could not be performed on the complainant at that time, however crime scene officers were able to take swabs from her hands for subsequent DNA analysis. Later that evening, and over the ensuing weeks and months, she was interviewed on a number of occasions by the police. 

21On 15 February 2010, the day following the incident, the complainant was taken to the Canberra for medical examination. At that time she was found to have significant inflammation of, and a degree of superficial grazing to, her outer genital area. 

The police investigation
22Strike Force Shell was formed in order to investigate the complainant's abduction. Information provided by the RTA established that the applicant was the owner of a vehicle, the description of which matched that provided by the complainant's mother. That information also established that the registration number of applicant's vehicle recorded by the RTA matched that provided to the police by Mr Connors. 

23The applicant was contacted by police and agreed to meet them for the purposes of providing a buccal swab. He failed to keep the appointment he had arranged with the police for that purpose and when subsequently contacted by police, he refused to provide the swab. As a consequence of his refusal, police commenced a covert surveillance operation targeting the applicant. That operation subsequently led the police to follow the applicant driving a vehicle which was registered to an escort agency in Albury. Later investigations established that the vehicle was being driven by the applicant in the course of his employment with that agency. Police secured the vehicle and forensically examined it. Analysis of swabs which were taken from the vehicle matched DNA recovered from the complainant's underpants. 

24The applicant was later arrested at his home in North Albury. 

THE SENTENCE PROCEEDINGS
25The applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings. Counsel who appeared for him on that occasion tendered a number of letters, some addressed to his solicitor and others addressed to the court, which sought to set out (amongst other things) an explanation for the offending. Although those documents formed part of the evidence, their admission was accompanied by what her Honour described as the ""usual caveat"" regarding the limited weight that could be attached to them in the absence of any cross examination of the applicant. 

26I have referred, in considering the particular grounds of appeal below, to specific aspects of her Honour's reasons for sentence. In light of grounds 2 and 5, which assert that the sentences imposed by her Honour in respect of counts 1 and 3 respectively were manifestly excessive, it is important to observe that her Honour made a number of findings which were favourable to the applicant, and which were not the subject of any challenge before this Court. They included the following: 


(i)the applicant, who was aged 27 at the time of the offending and 30 at the time of sentence, was a person of no prior criminal history, and a person of whom referees spoke highly (at AB 16; 23);


(ii)his pleas of guilty had significant utilitarian value, and had saved both the victim's family and his own family the trauma of living through a trial and, in particular, had saved the victim from re-living her ordeal (at AB 23);


(iii)his pleas of guilty demonstrated contrition and remorse (at AB 23);


(iv)his offending was an aberration and uncharacteristic (at AB 23);


(v)he was willing to undergo psychotherapy and counselling (at AB 23 - 24);


(vi)his time on remand had been lengthier than might otherwise have been the case, as a consequence of which he had been deprived of the opportunity of attending psychotherapy or psychiatric treatment, or attending any extra curricular activities which might ordinarily have otherwise been available (at AB 20-21);


(vii)a custodial sentence would, due to the applicant's impaired psychological status, weigh more harshly upon him than it would in the case of a person of more resolute psychological well being (at AB 24);


(viii)his period in custody would also be onerous because of the nature of the offences and the consequence that he would be on strict protection or non-associative protection (at AB 21);


(ix)the opportunity for family members to visit him in prison would be significantly reduced because of his family's intended move to Queensland (at AB 21);


(x)the applicant was highly unlikely to re-offend if given the opportunity to undergo appropriate treatment, both in custody and upon his eventual release back into the community (at AB 24);


(xi)his family remained supportive of him, although his rehabilitation would be largely dependent upon him taking steps to resolve the issues which led to his disturbed psychology and sequelae (at AB 24);, 


(xii)although there was no satisfactory explanation for it, his offending was an aberration and was due, in some small part, to the applicant's disturbed psychology, or perhaps his unresolved anger and resentment towards women, coupled with a desire for revenge (at AB 23); and


(xiii)he suffered from a ""precarious mental state"", a factor which he was entitled to have taken into account in light of the medical evidence which was to the effect that his psychosexual disorder, avoidant personality and disturbed psychology may have had some part to play in the offending (at AB 22 - 23).

27To the extent that the findings outlined above went to the applicant's psychological state, they were based upon the unchallenged opinions of Dr Westmore, Psychiatrist, which were set out in a number of reports tendered, without objection, in the applicant's case before her Honour. It is apparent that her Honour accepted those opinions, describing Dr Westmore (at AB 20) as ""a well respected psychiatrist who provides reports on behalf of the Crown and offenders in all manner of criminal matters"". Having accepted Dr Westmore's opinions, she reached a number of further conclusions, all of which were favourable to the applicant, as follows: 


(i)the applicant had suffered from depression throughout much of his life, including during his childhood, and such depression may have been exacerbated by failed relationships with women (at AB 18);


(ii)it was more probable than not that the applicant's offending was a result of his feelings of revenge towards women (at AB 18);


(iii)he had deep seated and unresolved psychological problems which required treatment by someone appropriately qualified, which exhibited a need for specific counselling, and which warranted enrolment in a sex offender's program (at AB 18);


(iv)he was not suffering from paedophilia, even though the offending was of that general kind, and accordingly, the offences were not as a result of that condition (at AB 19, 20);


(v)the offences, whilst voluntary, were committed as a result of, or were motivated by, a complex, deep seated and unresolved psychological and personality difficulty from a mental illness at the relevant time, although it was probable that he was suffering from a depressive disorder, most likely in the nature of an adjustment disorder (at AB 19);


(vi)he had a dysfunctional psychosexual history (at AB 19);


(vii)incarceration would exacerbate the applicant's depression (at AB 19);


(viii)he did not suffer from an autistic disorder, be it typical or atypical (at AB 20);


(ix)although he presented with some features of Asperger's disorder, this was not sufficient to qualify for that particular diagnosis (at AB 20);


(x)he suffered from an anti-avoidant personality disorder, a psychosexual disorder, and depression (at AB 20);


(xi)the offending behaviour occurred in the context of the applicant's disturbed psychology, rather than from a primary psychosexual disorder (at AB 20).
 

THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL
Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred in holding that the objective seriousness of the offences was aggravated by the fact that they were part of a series of acts aimed at self-sexual gratification.

Her Honour's findings
28In the course of her assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending, her Honour observed that it was necessary to consider the overall circumstances in which the offences were committed. This, she said, included a consideration of the period of time over which the offences occurred, whether a degree of force, coercion or threat was used, and the immediate aftermath of the offending. Having made a number of observations of the circumstances in which the acts constituting the applicant's offending were committed, her Honour said (at AB 30):

""These acts do not appear to be fleeting. The child was abducted and deprived of her liberty whilst being sexually assaulted over a period of 1 ½ hours. That is not an insignificant period of time and were, of course, part of a series of acts committed over that time, not one isolated act wherein the offender came to his senses and ceased what he was doing, but a series of acts aimed a self-sexual gratification. That aggravates the objective seriousness of his crime"" (emphasis added in each case).

The submissions of the parties
29It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that in the passage referred to above, her Honour erred in concluding that the objective seriousness of the offences was aggravated by the fact it involved a ""series of acts aimed at self-sexual gratification"". That error was said to have arisen in two ways.

30Firstly, it was submitted that although her Honour did not specifically refer to, it was evident that in referring to a ""series of acts"" her Honour must have had s. 21A(2)(m) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in mind. Accepting that to be the case, it was submitted that her Honour had misconstrued the provisions of that section, and had engaged in an impermissible process of double counting. 

31Secondly, it was submitted that a further error arose from her Honour's conclusion that the applicant's offending was aggravated by the fact that it was aimed at self-sexual gratification. It was submitted that self-sexual gratification was, generally speaking, an inherent characteristic of offending of this kind, and that in treating it as an aggravating factor, her Honour had again engaged in a process of double counting. 

32The Crown submitted that when her Honour's reasons were examined as a whole, a conclusion could not be reached that any error had been made out. Firstly, the Crown relied on the fact that her Honour made no reference at all to the provisions of s. 21A(2)(m). The Crown submitted that the passage cited by the applicant in support of this ground amounted to nothing more than her Honour's acknowledgement of the need to assess the seriousness of the applicant's offending in an overall context.

33In support of that submission, the Crown pointed to the fact that her Honour had expressly acknowledged (at AB 26) that there was a need not to engage in what she described as ""double punishment"". The Crown submitted that the fact that her Honour had cautioned herself in that regard tended against a finding that she had proceeded to engage in the process which she had expressly acknowledged was impermissible. 

Consideration and conclusion
34Section 21A(2)(m) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is in the following terms: 

21A Aggravating, mitigating and other factors in sentencing 
...
(2) The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows: 
...
(m) the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts, 
...

35Plainly, this was not a case where there was one offence containing a number of allegations of criminal acts that were part and parcel of a single course of criminal conduct. Accordingly, s. 21A(2)(m) had no application. In my view, although her Honour did not specifically refer to that provision, the only reasonable construction which can be attributed to that part of her reasons set out in [28] above is that she was seeking to give effect to it. In particular, her Honour's reference to ""these acts"" and ""a series of acts"" on the part of the applicant can, in my view, only be construed as a reference to the acts which constituted the individual offences. Her Honour obviously regarded those acts as aggravating the applicant's offending. 

36Accepting that interpretation, her Honour's approach was at odds with that set out in R v Tadrosse (2005) 65 NSWLR 740; [2005] NSWCCA 145 where Howie J (with whom the other members of the court agreed) said at [28]-[29]:

""His Honour was also in error in taking into account as an aggravating feature s 21A(2)(m) ""the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts"". Clearly there were multiple offences before the court and they indicated that there were multiple victims and a series of criminal acts. But the applicant was going to be sentenced for each of those offences and the fact that there were multiple victims and multiple acts of criminality would be addressed by the sentences to be imposed for each of those offences in accordance with the principle of totality. With respect it is illogical to take into account, where there are multiple offences charged, that it is an aggravating factor relevant to each offence that there is a series of criminal acts disclosed by the offences before the court. 

[29] Clearly the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(m) is concerned with the situation where a single offence contains a number of allegations of criminal acts that are part and parcel of a single course of criminal conduct.""

37A further error stems from the fact that her Honour found that the applicant's offending was aggravated because it was aimed at self-sexual gratification. Such a conclusion was directly contrary to that reached by this Court in Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 where McClellan CJ at CL (with whom the other members of the court agreed) said in the context of similar offending (at [113]):

""It was inherent in the offence that it would be carried out for the purpose of the sexual gratification of the perpetrator. This would not be an aggravating factor.""

38Although, as the Crown pointed out, her Honour was apparently mindful of the need not to engage in double punishment, the passage in respect of which complaint is now made necessarily had that very effect. 

39For all of these reasons, I would uphold this ground. 

Ground 2 - the sentence in respect of the offence under s. 66B Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) is manifestly excessive.
40The offence under s. 66B was contained in count 1. Her honour imposed a non-parole period of 12 years, with a balance of term of 5 years, a total term of 17 years. That sentence was imposed in circumstances where the maximum penalty for the offences was imprisonment for 25 years.

Her Honour's reasons
41In the course of her reasons, her Honour said (AB 30):

""In assessing the objective seriousness...it is necessary to consider the overall circumstances in which the offences were committed, over what period of time the offences occurred, whether a degree of force or coercion or threat was used to ensure compliance and then silence thereafter, and of course the immediate aftermath upon the victim"".

42Her Honour then said (at AB 33):

""I find each offence committed falls above the mid range of objective seriousness but not in the worst case category"".

43Her Honour did not express a view, either generally or specifically, how far above the mid range the offending fell. 

44Importantly however, her Honour imposed the sentence for this count after reaching a number of conclusions favourable to the applicant, and which I have previously set out. 

The submissions of the parties
45Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that when viewed overall, the sentence was one which was unreasonable or plainly unjust (see generally Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25]; 370-371; Carroll v R [2009] HCA 13; (2009) 254 ALR 379 at [8]; 381). He submitted that the unreasonableness of the sentence imposed was reflected in two particular matters.

46Firstly, he submitted that taking into account the 25 percent discount to reflect the early plea of guilty, her Honour must have necessarily adopted a starting point of 22 years imprisonment, a figure which was equivalent to 88% of the maximum penalty. Bearing in mind that her Honour did not find that the applicant's offending fell into the worst case, senior counsel submitted that her Honour's starting point was unreasonable, and indicative of manifest excess in the sentence which was ultimately imposed. 

47Secondly, senior counsel submitted that the sentence imposed by her Honour was inconsistent with the findings reached in the applicant's favour, which I have previously set out in detail. 

48In advancing each of these submissions, senior counsel made reference to the sentencing statistics available from the judicial commission. He also relied on the fact that the most significant sentence for an offence under s. 66B was that imposed in R v Cunningham [2006] NSWCCA 176 where this Court reduced a sentence of 13 years imposed by the sentencing judge to one of 10 years and 3 months imprisonment.

49Senior counsel also submitted that her Honour had erred in her conclusion that the offending in count 1 was above the mid range of objective seriousness. The error was said to stem from the fact that her Honour had not taken the further step of specifying the extent to which the offending exceeded that range.

50The Crown submitted that it was essential that any consideration of sentencing statistics, and any consideration of sentences imposed in other cases, be undertaken with undertaken with caution. The Crown submitted that sentencing is neither a mathematical process, nor a process which is advanced by comparisons with other cases involving sentences imposed for similar offences. The Crown emphasised that there was a need to recognise that not only do facts of cases differ, the particular circumstances of individual offenders also differ, and that such circumstances simply emphasised the importance of instinctive synthesis in the sentencing process. 

51The Crown acknowledged that the sentence imposed by her Honour in respect of count 1 could properly be categorised as stern or even severe. However, the Crown submitted that it was a sentence which was nevertheless appropriate in all of the circumstances.

Consideration and conclusion
52In R v RLS [2012] NSWCCA 236 I observed (with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J) at [132] that care must be taken when engaging in comparative exercises of the kind that the Court was invited to undertake in the present case. I pointed out, in particular, the necessity to bear in mind the importance of considering the entirety of the circumstances which resulted in a particular sentence being imposed in a particular case. 

53This Court has also said on many occasions that a similarly careful approach must be exercised when the Court is asked to undertake an analysis of sentencing statistics which, of themselves, may be of limited use (see for example R v Nikolovska [2010] NSWCCA 153 at [117] per Kirby J (with whom Beazley JA and Johnson J agreed)). 

54As I have previously noted, one of the matters relied upon in support of this ground was that her Honour, having found that the applicant's offending was above the mid range of seriousness, erred in failing to take the further step of providing an indication of the extent to which the offending fell above that range. In support of that submission senior counsel for the applicant relied upon the judgment McClellan CJ and Cl (with whom James and Davies JJ agreed) in Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 at [119]. 

55The decision in R v Ingham pre-dated that of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CL120. In PK v R [2012] NSWCCA 263 McCallum J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Price J agreed) expressed the view that following Muldrock, a sentencing judge need not, and arguably should not, attempt to quantify the distance between the actual offence before the court and a putative offence in the middle of the range.

56In these circumstances, and although it is not a matter which is necessary to decide for the purposes of determining the applicant's appeal, I am doubtful that her Honour's failure to provide a specific indication of the extent to which the applicant's offending was above the mid range amounted to an error. In any event, and for the reasons which follow, I am nevertheless satisfied that this ground has been made out, and that the sentence imposed by her Honour in respect of count 1 was manifestly excessive. There are a number of matters which have led me to form that view. 

57Firstly, it is significant that her Honour did not find that the applicant's offending which constituted count 1 was aggravated in any particular way, nor did she identify any other factor which might have justified a starting point of 22 years imprisonment. That starting point was only three years less than the prescribed maximum penalty. That, of course, is the penalty reserved for an offence falling within the worst category (see generally Ibbs v R (1987) 163 CLR 447). Her Honour did not make a finding that the applicant's offending was within, or even close to, that category.

58By way of example, but without being exhaustive, offending of this nature can be aggravated by matters such as threats designed to have a victim comply with certain acts, the perpetration of violence towards the victim (be it for the purposes of ensuring compliance or otherwise), and threats of reprisals to the victim in the event that the offending is reported to the authorities. One or more of those factors, had they been present in the applicant's offending, may have had the capacity to justify a starting sentence towards the upper end of the prescribed maximum penalty. However, no such factors formed a part of the applicant's offending. In my view, the absence of a finding that the applicant's conduct was aggravated in any relevant way goes some way to supporting a conclusion that the sentence imposed by her Honour was manifestly excessive, in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust.

59I am fortified in that view by the extensive and detailed findings which her Honour reached in the applicant's favour. No issue was raised by the Crown in the hearing of this appeal in relation to any of those findings. Importantly, they included a number of important findings in relation to the applicant's mental state both before and at the time of the offending. Her Honour described the applicant's mental state as ""precarious"". Importantly, she also found that there was a causal link between that mental state and the applicant's offending. 

60In my view, the nature and the extent of the findings which were made in the applicant's favour are not reflected in the sentence that was ultimately imposed in relation to count 1. I am left to conclude that having reached such findings, her Honour failed to ascribe sufficient weight to them in the sentencing process, resulting in the imposition of a sentence which was manifestly excessive. 

61For these reasons I would uphold ground 2. 

Ground 3 - The sentencing judge erred in determining the objective seriousness of the offence under s. 66A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

Ground 4 - the sentencing judge erred in taking into account the standard non-parole period in respect of the offence under s. 66A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)

Ground 5 - the sentence in respect of the offence under s.66A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) is manifestly excessive.

Her Honour's findings
62The offence under s. 66A(2) (which was count 3) carried a standard non-parole period of 15 years, which was the non-parole period her Honour ultimately imposed. 


63I have previously noted that her Honour reached the conclusion that each episode of the applicant's offending fell above the mid range of objective seriousness, but did not take the further step of reaching a conclusion regarding the extent to which this was the case. Further, in sentencing the offender her Honour made reference (at AB 29) to the fact that the complainant:

""..... had been snatched from the yard of her home and driven away from the presence of her mother in the circumstances as I have described - as the Crown rightfully submits, particularly heinous crimes"".


The submissions of the parties
64In support of ground 3, senior counsel for the applicant submitted that the circumstances referred to by her Honour in that passage of her reasons set out in [63] above were what rendered the offence under s. 66A(2) aggravated. In these circumstances, senior counsel submitted that it should be concluded from that passage that her Honour gave too much weight to the fact of the complainant's deprivation as a factor aggravating the objective seriousness of the offence. 

65Senior counsel further submitted that in light of the paucity of the evidence which was before her Honour as to the precise circumstances of the offending in count 3, her determination of the objective seriousness of that offence, namely that it fell above the mid range, was an error. 

66In respect of ground 4, senior counsel for the applicant submitted that there was a lack of transparency in her Honour's approach. This was said to have arisen from her Honour's finding that the applicant's offending in respect of count 3 was above the mid range. Senior counsel submitted that a sentencing judge who chooses to adopt an approach to sentencing which involves a finding being made in those terms, assumes an added obligation to make his or her findings transparent by indicating the extent to which the offending falls above that particular point in the range. 

67In respect of ground 5 senior counsel submitted that even if a conclusion were reached that grounds 3 and 4 were not made out, the sentence imposed in respect of count 3 was nevertheless one which was manifestly excessive. In this regard he relied firstly upon other decisions of this Court which, he submitted, supported the conclusion that the sentence was manifestly excessive. He also pointed to the fact that, to the extent that it could be ascertained by reference to available material, the sentence imposed upon applicant was the highest imposed for an offence under s. 66A(2). Senior counsel further relied upon the findings made by her Honour in favour of the applicant which, he submitted, were inconsistent with the sentence which was ultimately imposed.

68The Crown submitted, by reference to the decision in PK (supra) that her Honour had not erred in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence contrary to s. 66A(2). The Crown further submitted that if error was found in this regard, it was of little or no significance.

69As to ground 4, the Crown pointed out that an offence under s. 66A(2) carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and a standard non-parole period of 15 years, and that her Honour was bound to have regard to both of those matters (as well as other factors) in determining an appropriate sentence. The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed reflected that her Honour had proper regard to those considerations. 

70In respect of ground 5, the Crown relied upon the observations of this Court in PK (supra) that offences of this nature are amongst the most serious in the Crimes Act, as evidenced by the maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The Crown submitted that the imposition of a significant sentence was what the legislature had decreed, and that it was the function of her Honour, and this Court, to implement the dictates of the legislature (as to which see R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 at [37] per Simpson J). The Crown also submitted that the fact that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was higher than any other imposed did not, of itself, establish that the sentence was manifestly excessive.

CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION
71In respect of ground 3, I am not persuaded that her Honour erred in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. On the evidence which was before her, and having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offending, it was open to her Honour to reach the conclusion that she did. 

72To the extent that the applicant's written submissions suggested that the objective seriousness of the offending was less because the intercourse was in the nature of fellatio, such a submission should be rejected for two reasons. Firstly, the submission reflects a serious underestimation of the reality of the applicant's offending. Secondly, it reflects an approach which is contrary to principle. The nature of the sexual intercourse which occurs in offending of this nature should not be considered in isolation, and then ranked in some form of hierarchy (see R v King [2009] NSWCCA 117 at [36] per McClellan CJ at CL). 

73For these reasons, ground 3 is not made out. 

74As to Ground 4, I do not accept the proposition that her Honour's reasons exhibited a lack of transparency. Her Honour made a finding as to the objective seriousness of the offending which was quite clear, and which was open on the evidence. For the reasons I have previously expressed, the weight of authority favours the proposition that her Honour did not err by failing to take the additional step of specifying the extent to which the offending exceeded the mid range.

75As to ground 5, the first observation to be made is that simply because a particular sentence is the highest which has ever been imposed for a particular offence does not, without more, establish manifest excess. Such a bald proposition necessarily fails to take into account the circumstances of the particular offending, and the circumstances of the offender, which resulted in the particular sentence being imposed. There is also considerable merit in the Crown's submission that, as a matter of common sense, there will always be a sentence which constitutes the longest sentence imposed for a particular type of offending. . 

76 A number of the decisions upon which senior counsel for the applicant relied in support of this ground are referred to in the judgment of McClellan JA in Leslie v R [2013] NSWCCA 48. As I have previously noted, comparative exercises of the kind that this Court was invited to undertake must necessarily be approached with caution. I do not propose to set out the circumstances of the individual cases to which the Court was referred. As might be expected, they exhibit both similarities and differences when compared to the case of the applicant. However, even when full weight is given to that circumstance, those cases tend to establish a sentencing pattern for offending of this nature which is, generally speaking, somewhat lower than the sentences imposed upon the applicant . 

77It is necessarily part of this Court's function to pay heed to, and apply, the principle of consistency in sentencing (see Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [47]). With that in mind, I have come to the view that the sentence imposed by her Honour in respect of count 3 is in excess of the range which is established by the decisions of this Court, to which we were referred.

78Further in my view, and for the reasons I expressed in relation to ground 2, the sentence imposed by her Honour does not sit comfortably with the findings which were reached in the applicant's favour. I am again left to conclude that having made those findings, her Honour failed to afford them sufficient weight in the sentencing process, resulting in the imposition of a sentence in respect of count 3 which was manifestly excessive, in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust.

79For these reasons I would uphold ground 5.

ORDERS
80Her Honour (at AB 32) made a finding of special circumstances based upon the applicant's mental health, the fact that this was his first time in custody, the conditions of that custody and the fact that he would need a longer than normal period of parole in order to enhance his prospects of rehabilitation. On the evidence before her Honour that finding was appropriate. 

81The orders that I propose will result in the applicant being re-sentenced in terms of counts 1 and 3. The sentences that I propose in respect of those counts take into account her Honour's finding of special circumstances. 

82I propose the following orders:


(i)leave to appeal granted;
(ii)appeal allowed;
(iii)the sentence imposed in respect of count 1, being the offence against s. 66B of the Crimes Act is quashed;
(iv)in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months imprisonment commencing on 25 February 2011 and ending on 24 August 2021, with a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months imprisonment commencing on 25 August 2021 and ending on 24 February 2026;
(v)the sentence imposed in respect of count 3, being the offence against s. 66A(2) of the Crimes Act is quashed;
(vi)in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 years and 7 months imprisonment commencing on 25 May 2011 and expiring on 24 December 2023, with a balance of term of 5 years and 5 months imprisonment commencing on 25 December 2023 and expiring on 24 May 2029;
(vii)the total overall sentence imposed upon the applicant is a non-parole period of 13 years and 4 months, commencing on 25 August 2010 and expiring on 24 December 2023, and a balance of term of 5 years and 5 months, commencing on 25 December 2023 and expiring on 24 May 2029; 
(viii)the earliest date upon which the applicant may be released to parole is 25 December 2023.

		17 April 2013",2013-04-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761295,R v Chenarjaafarizad [2013] NSWSC 388,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Mr Saied Chenarjaafarizad stands for sentence for having committed the offence of affray at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (""VIDC"") on 20 April 2011.
2Affray is an offence contrary to s 93C of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the maximum penalty that is prescribed for it is imprisonment for 10 years.
The offender's immigration history
3The offender came to Australia as what is termed an ""irregular maritime arrival"" on 31 January 2010 and was detained pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).  He was held on Christmas Island before being transferred to the VIDC on 17 July 2010.
4The VIDC is an approved place under the Migration Act for the detention of persons not authorised to enter or remain in Australia.  Staffing at the VIDC was contracted by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (""DIAC"") to a company known as Serco.  
5There are three compounds within the VIDC; the offender was housed in the Fowler Compound.  There were four residential buildings within Fowler, named the Macquarie Building, the Nepean Building, the Clarence Building and the Darling Building.  There were sundry other buildings, such as an office, mess, recreation room, gym and a laundry. There were 158 detainees within Fowler on 20 April 2011.
6The offender applied for a protection visa and this required that his status as a genuine refugee be assessed.  On 24 June 2010 he was advised of a negative outcome to that assessment.  He then applied for an ""independent merits review"" but on 24 March 2011 it was again determined that he was not a genuine refugee.  He was not notified of that determination until 13 May 2011.  On 24 February 2012 the offender applied for a Criminal Justice Stay visa but this was refused on 17 July 2012. A Post Review Protection Check assessment was initiated in April last year that remains to be finalised.  In the normal course of events, I understand that if there was a favourable outcome of that assessment the applicant could then be considered for the granting of a visa.
7The offender's case has been referred for consideration as to whether he could be held in ""community detention"".  Resolution of that issue has been deferred pending finalisation of the present proceedings.
Facts
8Two detainees, Mehdi Darabi and Amir Morad Mansoor, were seen on the roof of the Macquarie Building early in the morning of 20 April 2011.  Thereafter they were seen to engage in various activities which included abusing Serco staff and throwing roof tiles. 
9In the early afternoon the activities officer tried to commence a game of soccer but Darabi and Mansoor told him not to because they were ""making a point by being on the roof"".  More tiles were thrown.  A detainee on the ground, Mahmood Dadash, approached the activities officer and remonstrated with him in an attempt to have him desist from starting the soccer game.  Another detainee, Ali Abdollahi, approached in the company of a large number of other detainees and threw punches at the activities officer but fortunately they did not connect. 
10Around the middle of the afternoon a staff member who was taking refreshments to staff near the Macquarie Building was abused, told to ""fuck off"" and had a tile thrown at him.  Mansoor called out, ""we're up here for a reason, don't drink in front of us, we are up here for a reason.  How dare you eat or drink in front of us.  If you drink or eat in front of us, we're going to throw tiles at you"".  Staff who had formed a cordon around the Macquarie Building to prevent other detainees getting onto the roof were ordered to move back.
11Detainees on the ground threw bedding and water bottles up to the roof.  This activity continued and at about 6.00pm.  Mansoor called out to staff, ""Don't stop them otherwise you'll get a tile thrown at your head"". 
12More detainees attempted to join Darabi and Mansoor on the roof after 7.00pm.  There was a large group on the ground, estimated to be between 40 and 60, aggressively yelling at Serco staff and management.  There was a rush towards the Macquarie Building and more detainees made their way to the roof. 
13At about 7.30pm, detainees were yelling, ""we want freedom"". This continued for some time.  Some of the detainees on the roof made ropes out of bed sheets to assist others climb up.
14At about 8.00pm, there was encouragement to those on the ground to continue the disturbance and come up to the roof.  Tiles were thrown at staff who were trying to prevent them.  One tile landed no more than a metre from one staff member who, naturally enough, had concerns for the safety of her staff and the other detainees.
15One officer estimated that at about 8.20pm there were 80-90 detainees around the Macquarie Building.  Thereafter the situation deteriorated with more shouting, yelling and abuse, tile throwing and other threatening behaviour towards staff.
16There was a bank of payphone booths near to the Macquarie Building.  At about 10.00pm, the offender was seen to be banging on the Perspex side of one of the booths.  The Crown contends that he was smashing his fists and banging his head against it.  Through his counsel, the offender says that he was banging his head and hitting it with an open hand.  The difference is immaterial.
17It was contended on the offender's behalf that he was ""upset and behaving abnormally"" and was responding to seeing one of the detainees on the roof, Ali Abdollahi, threatening to commit suicide.  Based upon the evidence I have heard in the trial, I am doubtful that the latter was genuine but, in any event, without having heard evidence from the offender I am not prepared to draw the inference for which his counsel, Mr Price, contends.
18There was an altercation between the offender and a male member of staff.  The offender repeated the demands that were being made by one of the detainees on the roof, Majid Parhizkar, for cigarettes and food.  He twice grabbed the staff member and then walked away, raising his arms and saying ""fuck you, fuck you"". 
19Detainees, including the offender, started to run around the compound discharging fire extinguishers.  Two witnesses gave evidence of seeing the offender spraying his fire extinguisher in the direction of staff and one said that he then threw it towards staff.  The evidence of those witnesses is disputed but the difference is immaterial; it is not suggested that any member of staff was affected by any of the spray or hit by the fire extinguisher itself.
20Detainees dragged wheelie bins on the soccer field where the rubbish was tipped out and then set alight.  The offender accepts that he was involved in this activity but denies lighting the fire.  I do not think that makes any difference.
21Timber tables and chairs were taken onto the field and put on the fire.  The offender denies involvement in this activity but in my view the evidence in the trial establishes that he played some part in it. 
22A number of detainees, including the offender, dismantled a set of soccer goal posts. This is disputed but two witnesses gave evidence of it.  One of those involved threw parts at Serco staff, but it is not contended by the Crown that he was the offender.
23These various events that the offender was involved in contributed significantly to the utter mayhem that was going on in the compound at around 11.00pm.  Staff were confronted with detainees on the roof throwing tiles at them and at buildings; a roaring bonfire on the soccer field; detainees running around discharging fire extinguishers and throwing them and other objects at staff.  They were forced to retreat behind a wall of the office so as not to be struck by tiles.  
24Eventually a group of around 20 or 30 detainees turned their attention to the staff and advanced towards them.  The most senior officer described them as advancing ""quickly and purposefully"".   One of them was holding a fire extinguisher above his head.  When they got near, this man looked like he was going to throw the fire extinguisher at the staff but he hesitated and threw it at a window in the office.  Another detainee then came from the bonfire with a burning piece of wood and leaned in through the broken window and set fire to the office.  At this point the staff fled the compound. 
25Fires were set in a number of other buildings thereafter.  The total amount of  damage caused in the Fowler Compound and in other areas within the VIDC was extreme; the estimated cost of reconstruction and repair is said to be in the order of $9 million.  It should be noted, however, that the involvement of the offender is limited to the incidents that I have referred to. 
26The offender was removed from the VIDC on 22 April 2011 and taken to the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater.  This was simply a transfer of his place of immigration detention but the reason for it was his involvement in the disturbance on 20 April.  He was charged on 4 May 2011 and remained in custody, bail refused, at Silverwater.  He was granted bail and returned to the VIDC on 7 March 2012.  It is common ground that I should take into account the entire period the offender was held in custody at Silverwater.
Seriousness of the offence
27I have observed when sentencing others involved in these events that an affray can occur in infinitely varied circumstances, but that it was clear that this one was particularly nasty. I have also said that a matter relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of the offence was that many people would have been terrified by what occurred and had their safety put at risk.   I am fortified in those views by what I have heard in the course of the trial over which I am presently presiding.  A number of the Serco officers, who were public officials simply trying to do their job, have been significantly affected.  That is not surprising.  As the events in the compound descended into mayhem they were cowering behind an office wall trying to avoid the torrent of tiles being hurled from the roof, while detainees on the ground were running rampant with fire extinguishers and setting fire to bedding, tables, chairs and other items in the middle of the soccer field.  Ultimately, the detainees succeeded in forcing the staff to evacuate just as the office building was torched.
28Affray is an offence that can be committed by one person but in this case there were a significant number who joined in the protest that had been commenced by Mansoor and Darabi, many of whom were actively involved in the use of violence.  The present offender was one who was particularly active. I have no doubt that he made a significant contribution to the crescendo of violence that overtook the Fowler Compound.  He was not a leader and his participation was not premeditated; but his actions must have played a role in motivating others to join in or continue with the violence. 
29Not all of the detainees in the compound were involved in the threatening or use of violence.  But some of those not involved in that way showed support for those that were by yelling and shouting.  There was the continual chanting of ""freedom"".  Witnesses also heard detainees calling out ""fuck Australia"", ""fuck immigration"" and ""fuck Serco"". This was all part of the context which cannot be ignored when assessing the culpability of individual offenders.
30I am mindful that the offender is being sentenced for the offence of affray, not of riot.  A person convicted of riot bears some vicarious responsibility for the collective damage caused by the conflagration, regardless of his or her level of personal involvement.  Participation in an offence of affray, even if committed in the circumstances of a large-scale disturbance, does not necessarily allow a similar inference, partly because s 93C does not require proof of, or a plea to, common purpose.  This distinction was discussed by R S Hulme J (Spigelman CJ and Smart AJ agreeing) in R v Huynh [2000] NSWCCA 18 at [27]-[29], distinguishing McCormack, Merlo, Mulholland & Nance v R [1981] VR 104; (1980) 2 A Crim R 405 at 108; 409.  
31Nevertheless, the facts in this case establish that the context of the disturbance was inextricable from the offending conduct.  It has not been contended otherwise. In addition, s 93C(2) provides that when two or more persons use or threaten unlawful violence it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered for the purposes of determining whether a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene would have feared for his or her personal safety. 
32No sentence other than one of full-time imprisonment is appropriate to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence.  I received no submission to the contrary.  Punishment, deterrence, denunciation and making the offender accountable for his actions are factors to be taken into account.  The length of the sentence to be imposed is, however, something to be determined with the personal circumstances of the offender borne in mind.
Matters personal to the offender
33The offender did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings.  The material I have as to his personal circumstances is confined to various psychiatric and psychological reports, medical records, and the written determination of the independent merits review I referred to earlier.  The author of the psychiatric report, Dr Stephen Allnutt, was called to give further evidence at the sentence hearing last week.
34Mr Price objected to the Crown's tender of the independent merits review determination on the basis of relevance.  Having considered all of the evidence, it appears to me to be relevant to the offender's credibility which is, in turn, relevant to the history he gave to the authors of reports.
35The offender was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1981 and is now aged 32. He was raised by his parents and has two sisters and two brothers.  He received a modest degree of school education.  He then worked selling cigarettes as a street vendor, according to what he told the psychologist; he told Dr Allnutt he made signs and reflectors and bought goods from Turkey which he transported to Syria.  He is single with no children.
36The history the offender provided to the authors of reports as to what occurred that prompted him to leave Iran is inconsistent and it reflects adversely upon his credibility and, consequently, upon a significant opinion expressed by Dr Allnutt to the effect that the offender was mentally ill.
37The offender told Dr Allnutt that he decided to leave Iran after he was released from a three-month period in the notorious Kahrizak detention centre.  There he was beaten with cables and batons and a number of fellow inmates died.  He had been arrested during a period of protests.
38He told the author of the psychological reports, Ms Shakeh Momartin, that he participated in demonstrations and protests against the government during the 2009 Iranian elections.  He told her that the detention centre he was sent to after his arrest housed 50 inmates but there was really only space for 20.  He described to her in more detail the nature of the torture that was inflicted upon the inmates.  They received one potato and were allowed one toilet visit per day. Ultimately the prison became so notorious that it was closed down and the inmates were released or transferred elsewhere.
39Ms Momartin recorded that the offender told her that he found it difficult to adjust after his release; he stayed inside his house for six months trying to recover from what he had experienced and witnessed.  She said, ""He reported that for the next two years, he lived in fear of being re-arrested and worked only sporadically in his selling job.  Feeling unable to function, a friend introduced him to a person who arranged to obtain a passport for him, which he used to leave the country by plane to Malaysia"".
40One of the problems with that account is that it can only have been a matter of months that he either stayed inside his house or ""lived in fear of being re-arrested"".  It is notorious that there were protests that followed the announcement of the disputed result of the Iranian presidential election in June 2009 and the offender was in Australia by January the following year.
41A difficulty with the offender's account to both Dr Allnutt and Ms Momartin is the account he gave during his Refugee Status Assessment.  His account then was that there were protests in June 2009 against a rise in the cost of fuel and that one day when he was on his way to work, he and others were arrested and taken to Kahrizak where he remained for 2 months before being let out without explanation.  He later told the independent merits reviewer that people protesting against the rise in the price of fuel set fire to a petrol station across the road from where his father was selling cigarettes. (I note that he told Ms Momartin that he had to work because his father was unable to.)  He also told the reviewer that he had run away after the petrol station fire but had been arrested the following day after he had left his house.  He also said that there were about 300 inmates in Kahrizak.
42The Crown Prosecutor asked Dr Allnutt about inconsistencies in the history given by the offender and he replied, in effect, that mentally ill people are capable of telling lies; in other words, telling lies did not mean that a person was not mentally ill.    But the offender's arrest and subsequent detention at Kahrizak could be expected to be something he would well remember and would be the most prominent thing he would talk about when seeking asylum as a refugee.  However, it appears he said nothing about it when first interviewed after his arrival in Australia.  On that occasion it is said that he claimed he left Iran because he was ""a stateless Kurd and was not allowed to continue to study in Iran"".
43Allowance should be made for difficulties with interpreters involved in the various interviews and also for the accuracy with which the report writers recorded what he had told them.  Nevertheless, the difference in the accounts given about one apparently significant feature of the offender's personal history is marked.  It highlights the need for considerable caution in accepting what he has said on that, and other, subjects.
44The offender told Dr Allnutt that he found life on Christmas Island initially a good experience but over time his mental state worsened.  He felt depressed when at Villawood.  He experienced the suicide of two fellow detainees; one who fell from a balcony and the other who hanged himself in a bathroom.  The second of these men had been a friend.
45By the time of the disturbance in April 2011 his application for refugee status had been refused and he was pessimistic about the pending result of the independent merits review.  He was sleeping poorly and when he did manage to sleep he had nightmares.  He told Dr Allnutt that he was not sure how he became involved in the events of 20 April and that a lot of things led to his involvement.  People were dying in the detention centre; he saw ""a lot of people having their lives destroyed in front of his eyes"".  He believed that the events were ""due to God's hand; it was said in the Bible and Koran whenever there was oppression and injustice it would not last long"".  
46He is also recorded as having said that he ""became involved because he was one of God's creatures; he felt he had to become involved because God wanted to make him understand things; he said at the time he was thinking about freedom for everyone not himself; he wanted to achieve freedom; he saw it as God's will that the event occurred"".  In another interview with Dr Allnutt he described the disturbance as ""a divine happening"".  
47He also told Dr Allnutt that he was not thinking at the time about it being wrong; awareness of the wrongfulness became more apparent to him later after he had been in gaol. He said that he ""felt sorry about it"" but ""remained distressed ... for those that had lost their lives in Villawood"". 
48The offender's reference to religious matters is not confined to what he said about the events of 20 April 2011.  He also said things such as ""that signs told him things that were going to happen, that if something bad was going to happen he would feel something hit the bottom of his foot"".  When Dr Allnutt asked him what it was, ""he said it was an angel, but God knew about this; he then spoke about angels getting 'into' him, that he did not know how angels got into him, but he knew that angels did come into him; he said everybody had an angel and went on to state that he did not know why God had chosen him; that possibly an angel had felt merciful and come into him"".   He made similar claims in January and February 2012 when seen by a Dr Daylan when in corrective services custody.
49Dr Allnutt made a diagnosis that the offender was and is suffering from a chronic psychotic disorder.  Differential diagnosis included schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder.  Schizotypal personality disorder was also a possibility.   He also said that through the period of time the offender was at Villawood he developed depressive symptoms consistent with a chronic adjustment disorder with a depressed mood, and anxiety in the form of depersonalisation and derealisation episodes, and probably exacerbation of his religious delusional beliefs.
50The problem with this is that Dr Allnutt based these diagnoses largely on the history given by the offender.  A most significant aspect of the history is the offender's religious beliefs that, if truly held, are clearly delusional.   Dr Allnutt did not readily accept the offender's history; he said in his evidence that he started from a point of scepticism but arrived at the diagnoses, or possible diagnoses, on balance, after taking into account a range of factors that he identified.
51There are a number of reasons, but two in particular, that cause me to doubt the validity of Dr Allnutt's opinion.  I do not say that lightly because I have the utmost respect for him; he has given evidence and provided reports as a forensic psychiatrist in many cases over many years and his expertise is undoubted.  The fact remains that I am of the view that the offender's account is unreliable.  
52The first reason I have already described:  the incident that he claims he experienced in 2009 and the various inexplicably different versions of it.  A second matter that is troubling is that there is no record of any claim by the offender of anything that could be regarded as indicative of delusional religious beliefs prior to him being prosecuted for his involvement in the events of 20 April 2011.
53There is no hint of the offender having such beliefs in any of the material derived through the refugee status assessment and independent merits review.  There is, again, no hint in either of the two psychological reports prepared by Ms Momartin.  Her reports are said to have been the product of assessments made on 25 August 2010 and 24 February 2011, each of two hours duration.  
54This is quite surprising given that Ms Momartin was endeavouring to explore his thought processes.  She did so to an extent that prompted her to conclude that he had anxiety symptoms, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms and depressive symptoms.  Her observations recorded in the reports include matters such as, ""[t]hought content revealed no evidence of delusions, paranoia or suicidal ideation"".   Dr Allnutt offered possible reasons why the delusional religious beliefs he thought the offender exhibited might not have been uncovered during Ms Momartin's psychological evaluations, but I believe it is a more likely explanation that the offender did not hold such beliefs.  I have also taken into account what Dr Allnutt said in his evidence about people with psychotic illnesses retaining the ability to tell lies.
55I am prepared to accept that the offender was anxious and feeling depressed at the time of the offence.  But, with great respect to Dr Allnutt, I am not prepared to accept on the balance of probabilities the diagnoses he made.
56Whilst I am not satisfied with the credibility of certain of the history provided by the offender, I am prepared to accept that he was the victim of some experiences in his home country, perhaps including torture, that were the genesis of his depression and anxiety which, in turn, were exacerbated by the experience he has had in immigration detention in this country.  I am also prepared to accept such matters as that the journey to Australia was harrowing; that there was overcrowding at times at Christmas Island; and that the experience of other detainees committing suicide was distressing.  I also accept the evidence of the offender having been involved in self-harming behaviours on a number of occasions.  Being in detention in a foreign country, many thousands of kilometres from his friends and family, with no clarity as to what the future might bring, must also have been a significant contributor to his depression.
57The offender has not otherwise transgressed against the criminal law since coming to this country in January 2010.  There is material within the independent merits review report that suggests he previously had some encounters with the criminal law of Iran but the material is not sufficiently clear for it to be taken into account.  Accordingly, I am prepared to treat the offender has having no significant record of previous convictions and, on that basis, as being of prior good character.  
58I say that despite some other material that could, on one view, be regarded as indicating that the offender has misconducted himself on a number of occasions whilst in immigration detention.  However, the information is scant and I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt because those incidents could likely have been borne of anger and frustration about the circumstances of the detention of himself and others; he does not seem to be a person who is averse to expressing such emotions by way of protest, for example, by way of a hunger strike.
59With that finding of good character in mind I am also prepared to accept on the balance of probabilities that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend.  Much will depend of course upon him receiving favourable treatment for his psychological issues.
60I am not satisfied that the offender is genuinely remorseful.  He acknowledged to Dr Allnutt and others that his actions on 20 April 2011 were wrong.  However, nowhere does it appear that he has given any thought to the plight of the Serco staff who were so put in fear by the events in the Fowler Compound that night that they cowered behind the office wall and were eventually driven to evacuate for their own safety. 
61I am prepared to accept that the offender will find a gaol environment more onerous than for more typical inmates.  To date he has spent about 15 months in immigration detention, then 10.5 months in gaol, and then just over 1 year again in immigration detention.  A return to gaol now with that history, coupled with the facts that he has limited English language skills and will not be able to receive visits from family and friends as other inmates can, will render his time considerably more onerous.
62The plea of guilty to affray was entered on 19 March 2013, the day before the Crown case closed.  The trial commenced with the empanelment of the jury on 11 February and in the preceding fortnight there had been the determination of various pre-trial issues.  Any utilitarian benefit flowing from the offender's plea is insignificant and so too will be any impact upon the sentence I impose.
Sentencing of others
63I sentenced Mahmood Dadash on 7 December 2012:  R v Dadash [2012] NSWSC 1511.  I sentenced Mehdi Darabi, Amir Morad Mansoor and Mehdi Agha Razai on 5 April 2013:  R v Darabi, Mansoor & Razai [2013] NSWSC 387.
64There is a need to impose a sentence upon the present offender that is appropriately proportional to those that were imposed upon those men. I have taken into account the objective gravity of the offences committed by them as well as the various ameliorating subjective circumstances as reflected in those sentencing judgments.  
65The offender's activities in the course of his offence were more extensive than those of Mr Dadash; but Mr Dadash's involvement ranged over a longer period.  Both have about an equivalent level of responsibility for tacitly encouraging others to become involved.  It seems to me that the sentence for the present offender should be the same as that which I assessed as the starting point, before reduction on account of his plea of guilty, for Mr Dadash. 
Other sentence considerations
66Mr Price invited me to take into account that the offence of affray is one that may be dealt with summarily in the Local Court.  I have taken that into account as a matter of some weight in sentencing others and have done so in this case as well.
67The period in which the offender was in corrective services custody from 22 April 2011 until 7 March 2012, which amounts to 321 days, is accepted to represent pre-sentence custody for which the offender should receive credit.  On that basis, the sentence I impose will be backdated so as to take effect from 1 June 2012.
68I was also invited to consider imposing a fixed term of imprisonment for a period the equivalent of the pre-sentence custody.  This was so as to avoid the offender failing the ""character test"" in s 501 of the Migration Act.  It is provided that the Minister may refuse to grant a visa to a person who fails that test.  It is provided in s 501(6)(a) that a person does not pass the test if they have a ""substantial criminal record"" which is defined (s 501(7)(c)) to include having been sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 12 months or more.  The submission overlooked the fact that s 501(6)(b)(aa)(i) also provides that a person fails the character test if convicted of an offence that was committed while in immigration detention.  So, the offender fails the test no matter what sentence is imposed.
69An alternative submission was that there should be a finding of special circumstances so as to reduce the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period; indeed, to reduce it to the equivalent of the pre-sentence custody so that the offender would be eligible, or entitled, to immediate release on parole. 
70I do find that there are special circumstances and they comprise an aggregate of matters disclosed in the presentation of the offender's subjective case, particularly his anxiety and depression; his return to gaol after having been in immigration detention for a significant period; and that custody will be more onerous for him in the ways I have described.  I have put aside the possibility that the offender faces the potential of deportation and consider that he, and the community, will be better served by him being supervised over a lengthier parole period, particularly in relation to treatment for his psychological issues.
Sentence
71Convicted.
72Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 1 year and a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year.
73The sentence will date from 1 June 2012.  I order the release on parole of the offender upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 31 May 2013.  The total term of the sentence will expire on 31 May 2014.
74I note that there is evidence of the offender having engaged in self-harming behaviour in the past.  I direct the attention of staff of Corrective Services NSW to this and direct that it be noted on the warrant.

		18 April 2013",2013-04-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761307,R v Forrest [2013] NSWSC 377,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1HER HONOUR:  Bailey Constable was four years old at the time of his death on 1 April 2011. 
2Death was pronounced at 11.51pm after the offender presented with the child at Warren Hospital at 11.05pm, unconscious and with no motor responses.  He had a carotid pulse but no radial pulse.  He did not regain consciousness. 
3His parents have consented to the publication of his name for the purpose of these proceedings.  Accordingly, I direct that the non-publication order previously made under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 be lifted.  
4It is accepted that the version of events the offender gave at the hospital on 1 April 2011 and to police on both 2 and 11 April, to the effect that he had left Bailey in the bath momentarily and that he must have slipped and hit his head before falling face down into the water unconscious, was deliberately untrue and proffered with the intention of concealing the fact that he had repeatedly struck the child about the head after which the child lapsed into unconsciousness.  I note that the offender insisted that the child's mother give police the same false account which she maintained until 6 May 2011 when she provided a detailed statement implicating the offender.
5On 7 May 2011 the offender was charged with Bailey's murder.  He has been in custody since that date.
6On 28 August 2012 he was committed for trial following a committal hearing where a number of expert medical witnesses gave evidence and were cross-examined about the cause and mechanism of death. 
7On his arraignment in this Court on 5 October 2012 he entered a plea of not guilty and a date was fixed for his trial.
8On 11 March 2013 he was re-arraigned and entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter.  The Crown accepted the plea in discharge of the indictment charging murder on the basis that the assault of the child was both unlawful and dangerous, and that it caused his death.  In so doing the Crown conceded that the evidence would not support a finding beyond reasonable doubt that when the offender assaulted the child he intended to kill him or to cause him really serious injury as distinct from those same actions, viewed objectively, carrying a significant risk that the child would suffer serious injury.
9Consistent with the authorities, the timing of the plea of guilty is critical to the assessment of the extent to which the sentence to be imposed will be discounted.  The plea of guilty entered after committal, and after the matter was listed for trial, indeed within a week of the trial date, is on any view a late plea.  I regard his plea of guilty as reflecting his acceptance of the inevitable factual finding that what he did to Bailey in the bathroom when Ms Constable heard the loud bangs and his angry remonstrations would have been found by a jury to have been causative of death in the legal sense.  The plea does, however, carry some residual utilitarian value.  I propose to allow a discount of 10 per cent.  His sentence will be backdated to account for his pre-sentence custody.  
10On sentence the Crown tendered an agreed statement of facts supplemented by a number of statements, including one from the nurse who was on duty in the emergency department of the hospital and to whom the offender gave the first of a series of untruthful explanations for Bailey's condition.  The Crown also tendered two post-mortem reports (an incomplete report from Dr Nadesan dated 24 September 2011 and the completed report form Dr Cala dated 25 November 2011); a neuropathology report from Dr Buckland dated 28 September 2011; the evidence at committal from various doctors and two reports from Dr Hilton, a forensic pathologist, prepared after the committal at the request of the offender's solicitors.  
11The statement of facts was also supplemented by oral evidence from Jessica Constable, Bailey's mother.  Where her evidence is at variance with her statement to police, I prefer her sworn evidence.  I accept her as a witness who was, in the proceedings before me, genuinely endeavouring to tell the truth. 
The facts
12The offender was 22 at the time of the offence.  He had been in a de facto relationship with Jessica Constable since Christmas of 2010.  They resided at Ms Constable's home at Warren, in central New South Wales.  The child was the only other member of the household at the time of his death.  Two younger siblings had been removed from the home by their father some weeks earlier because of his concern at the level of care they were receiving.  He was not Bailey's father.
13Ms Constable described the offender as loving and friendly in the early stages of their relationship, but when he was under the influence of methamphetamine or when withdrawing from the drug he was violent towards her and caused damage to her property.  She told police he had only used drugs, to her knowledge, a few times before the Christmas period but that his use increased dramatically after that time.  When he was under the influence of drugs, Ms Constable described the offender as ""like a ticking time bomb"".  She could not tell whether, or when, he was going to yell and scream or hit something, including her.  This was coincident with the offender's last contact with the Probation and Parole Service during a period of supervision following a conviction for violence in Queensland in February 2010.  In November 2011 he reported to his parole officer that he had relapsed into drug use through his friendship with a drug dealer from whom he could get drugs at a reduced cost.  
14On 20 January 2011, arrangements were made for Bailey to stay at the home of his maternal grandparents, Karen and Jeffery Chapman, in Warren.  On different occasions, over subsequent weeks, Bailey said that the offender had hurt him.  He told Mrs Chapman that the offender hurt him and held him down in the bath.  His grandparents attempted to air concerns about their grandson's welfare with the Department of Community Services and the Police but no official action was taken.  Bailey was returned to the care of his mother on 26 February 2011.  
15On 28 March 2011, Bailey was taken to Warren Hospital by his mother and the offender, where he was seen by Dr Thein Win.  (Dr Win also attended to Bailey on the night he died.)  On 28 March Dr Win noted that Bailey had an injury to his nose, black eyes and an abrasion to his right forehead.  The offender claimed that the child had fallen and hit his face against a bed.  The evidence led on sentence, including residual evidence of these injuries revealed on autopsy and the views of the forensic pathologist as to their likely cause, raise serious questions as to whether those injuries were in fact sustained accidentally.  The evidence does not, however, permit me to find, to the criminal standard, that they were deliberately inflicted by the offender.  The child was again returned to the care of his mother and the offender, as her de facto partner. 
16On 1 April 2011 at 1am, and progressively throughout that day, the offender self-administered injections of methamphetamine.  At 9.30am a number of people arrived at Ms Constable's home and consumed cannabis.  The offender left with them. 
17Bailey was ill throughout that day, suffering from constant diarrhoea, vomiting and a lack of appetite.  He was also suffering from a chronic and recurrent urinary tract infection which was being treated with Panadol. 
18The offender returned at approximately 9.30pm by which time the child was asleep in his bed.  Ms Constable noticed that the offender was restless and agitated and that his hands were shaking, mannerisms that she had previously observed when he was under the influence of amphetamine-based drugs.  
19Some short time later Bailey called out that he had wet his bed.  Ms Constable went to tend to the child.  She changed his bedding while the offender took the child to the bathroom and ran the bath.  She noticed that the offender's mood had worsened.  She was ordered to leave the bathroom.  From the lounge room, Ms Constable heard the offender yell out in an aggressive and angry manner on four successive occasions, ""Stop it, Bailey, stop it"", associated with a loud bang on each occasion.  She eventually walked down the hallway to the bathroom.  When she got to the door she saw the offender pulling the child out of the bath.  She did not ask what had happened as she feared being assaulted.  As Bailey commenced to walk towards her he fell to his knees.  She picked him up and carried him to the bedroom where she dried and dressed him for bed.  She said he was hot to the touch and appeared glassy-eyed.  He fell again to his knees as he tried to walk to his bed at the offender's direction.  The offender was by this time very agitated and ordered Ms Constable to leave the bedroom.  She again complied out of fear for herself, leaving Bailey standing in the bedroom with the offender.  She did not hear anything further from the child or the offender.  A short while later the offender joined her in the lounge room, reporting that the child was fine and going to sleep.
20A few minutes later the offender volunteered to go and check on the child.  Ms Constable regarded this as unusual as he had not previously displayed concern of that kind.  Almost immediately the offender yelled out for Ms Constable to come to the bedroom.  Ms Constable, fearing for the safety of the child, took her mobile telephone with her.  She saw the child on the bedroom floor lying on his back.  He was blue in colour.  The offender picked him up and shook him vigorously but the child did not respond.  The offender commenced CPR in the course of which the child brought up a quantity of what was described as water which was red in colour.
21Ms Constable unsuccessfully attempted to make contact with emergency services by dialling 000.  The offender told Ms Constable to send a text message to his parents as they lived nearby.  Ms Constable then rang 000 again.  During this call she noticed the child was awake and lying in the offender's lap but he did not seem to her to be fully conscious.  He was still glassy-eyed.
22The offender's father arrived within minutes of the text message being sent, and took the child to Warren Hospital with the offender where he was later pronounced deceased. 
The results of autopsy
23At autopsy multiple sites of redness with underlying bruising were located on the child's forehead and both cheeks, with a greater concentration of bruising on the right side of the face.  The largest bruise measured 3.5cm x 2.5cm.  There were multiple parallel patterned areas of bruising on the back of the head, on both the left and right sides, associated with bleeding under the scalp.  There was also bruising to the limbs.  There was an abrasion below the left eye and distinct areas of abrasion on the bridge, sides and tip of the nose which were described as ""not recent"".  (I am satisfied these injuries were those sustained on 28 March.)  Both buttocks showed diffuse pink bruising without bleeding into the subcutaneous tissues and an abraded contusion across the back above the buttock.  (It would appear that these were the result of smacking and the use of a belt delivered some time previously as punishment for some unspecified wrong.)  There was generalised acute inflammation of the child's genitalia and an area of deep bruising in the scrotal skin with associated acute inflammation.  (These injuries would appear to have been the result of the untreated urinary tract infection, although trauma could not be excluded.)  The abdominal cavity contained 50ml of blood with an associated area of fresh internal bruising surrounding the ascending colon.  Photographs showed the presence of blood in the airways and major bronchi of each lung and a quantity of clear pleural fluid in the space between the surface of the lung and the chest wall. 
The cause of death
24At the committal hearing, and in the various forensic investigations undertaken since that date by both the Crown and the offender's solicitor, with the most recent report furnished by Dr Hilton in March 2013, the precise cause and mechanism of Bailey's death was the subject of considerable debate.   
25Dr Cala, the forensic pathologist who completed the autopsy which had been commenced but not completed by Dr Nadesan, originally reported that the cause of death was blunt force head trauma as evidenced by the internal and external bruising to the child's face and head.  Dr Cala also noted that there was a right-sided subdural haemorrhage associated with brain swelling but not associated with any fracture to the skull.  He was unable to determine with certainty which head and/or facial injuries led to the subdural haemorrhage.  In his view, the patterned injuries observed at the back of the head could have been occasioned through contact with a tiled surface or a carpeted surface.  He specifically noted that there was no evidence of drowning or immersion.  In his opinion the other recent non-accidental injuries to the child's face, abdomen, buttocks and limbs were not life threatening, but they could have significantly incapacitated the child leading to his death. 
26Dr Buckland, a neuropathologist, was of the opinion that the injuries observed in the child's brain and spinal cord, including subdural blood at the back of the head; a generalised spread of subarachnoid blood and only mild swelling of the brain with no demonstrable brain damage were insufficient to cause death, although they may have resulted in a period of unconsciousness.  Those views cast doubt on Dr Cala's appointment of the cause of death as blunt force head injury.  After considering Dr Buckland's opinion and his acknowledged expertise as a neuropathologist, Dr Cala amended his views as to cause of death as follows:I am now of the view that my former opinion which related to the head injuries as causing death was overly narrow and did not fully take into full consideration the effects of the other injuries. 
My view now is that this child died from ""multiple injuries"".
It is the combination of all the injuries which has led to the death of this child, not just the head injuries even though the head injuries could hardly be viewed as trivial. 
27Dr Hilton was of the view that after reviewing all the available evidence and the opinions of his colleagues that the cause of death was better described as ""undetermined"".  He did, however, offer what I consider to be valuable insights into the significance of the inhaled blood and the presence of the fluid in the child's lungs which inform the findings I must make for sentencing purposes, both as to the cause of death and the injuries inflicted by the offender that were causative of death.  He reported that the photographs taken at autopsy:... show unequivocal evidence of wide spread aspiration of blood into the anatomical parts of the lung where gas exchange normally takes place.  The presence of this much blood may be expected to substantially impair the body's ability to exchange inhaled oxygen for carbon dioxide and thus lead to a degree of asphyxiation.
An additional possibility is suggested by the photographic appearance of the non-bloody part of the lungs and by Dr Nadesan's description of ""a little clear pleural fluid"" (fluid in the potential space between the lung surface and the chest wall).  Although the diagnosis of ""drowning"" has been dismissed the aspiration of small but pathologically significant quantities of fresh water has not.  Because fresh (tap) water is hypotonic (has a lower concentration of chemicals) in comparison to blood, in addition to its initial asphyxiating effect when aspirated, it is readily absorbed into the blood stream through the walls of the little air sacs of the lung and can cause profound additional disruption of the blood chemistry including the release of potassium from broken-up (haemolysed) red blood cells.  Again this is difficult to demonstrate conclusively at post-mortem even when actively sought.
...
While there is some bruising of the root of Bailey's right lung (and possibly the periphery) there is manifest evidence of inhalation of considerable quantities of blood, possibly from his demonstrated nose injury.  There is photographic and historical evidence to at least suggest the aspiration of fresh water.  All this would suggest an element of respiratory failure and its concomitant biochemical disturbances as causative factors in his death. 
28Many of the contentious issues raised by the expert medical evidence concerning the cause of death have been resolved for sentencing purposes since, by his plea of guilty, the offender accepts that he caused Bailey's death when he struck him about the head and body on the night he died.  However, because the offender persists with the claim that he has no memory of what he did to Bailey before the child lapsed into unconsciousness in the bedroom (which I am satisfied the offender knew when he left the child's bedroom, as distinct from something he discovered when he returned, ostensibly to check on him, minutes later) it is necessary for me to make positive findings as to which of the injuries revealed on autopsy the offender was responsible for inflicting and which of those, in combination, were causative of death. 
29Efforts to achieve unanimity between the forensic pathologists as to the precise mechanism or cause of death was complicated by the suggestion adverted to by Dr Hilton that respiratory failure may have been a causative factor.  This raises the question whether the offender attempted to deliberately submerge Bailey's head or face in the bath before, after, or at the time he repeatedly struck him about the head, and that in that process the child inhaled water and blood into his lungs thereby putting his respiratory function under stress, or whether the inhalation of bath water was an accidental incident of that assault.  
30The resolution of that question is not unimportant for sentencing purposes since the level and type of violence inflicted by an offender are factors to be taken into consideration in the assessment of objective seriousness of a manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act.  In this case, because the Crown has accepted the offender's plea of guilty to manslaughter, even were I satisfied that the evidence supports a finding that the offender deliberately submerged Bailey's head or face in the bath, I would be required to confine use of that fact to informing the nature and extent of his unlawful treatment of the child, as distinct from considering that conduct as capable of proving that he attempted or intended to drown Bailey after he had struck him or in the process of striking him.  
31Despite my grave suspicions that the offender did deliberately submerge the child's face and head in the bath, whether as part of his punishment for soiling his bed or simply a result of the offender's unrestrained anger, I am unable to reach that conclusion beyond reasonable doubt.  There is at least the reasonable possibility that when he was repeatedly struck about the head and body Bailey lost his balance and fell down into the bath, inhaling water in the process.  Even so, the obvious risk of the child falling and inhaling water when repeatedly struck to the head cannot be ignored and will not be ignored for sentencing purposes.
32By his plea of guilty, his adoption of an agreed statement of facts and his counsel's concession in oral submissions, the offender accepts that he is to be sentenced on the basis that he repeatedly struck Bailey's head and that at, or about, the same time he delivered a blow or blows to the child's abdomen.  It is not necessary for me to determine whether those assaults or that series of assaults occurred in the bathroom, or the bathroom and the bedroom.  It is sufficient that I am satisfied (and I am to the criminal standard) they were ultimately productive of multiple sites of bruising to Bailey's face and head, with an associated subdural haemorrhage and an internal abdominal injury.  Although neither the subdural haemorrhage nor the abdominal injury were themselves capable of causing the child's death, in the context of his chronic urinary tract infection and the other head injuries which, to the offender's knowledge, he had suffered on 28 March 2011, and the likelihood that he inhaled bath water and blood in the course of the assault, thereby compromising his respiratory function, I am satisfied the combination of all of the assaultive injuries inflicted by the offender on 1 April 2011 caused the child's death.
33While for sentencing purposes I am obliged to isolate only those traumatic injuries that can be attributed to the actions of the offender (and for that reason I must disregard the injuries to his nose and buttocks), since I am well satisfied the offender was aware of the child's generalised state of ill health (including the injuries sustained within days of his death) for the offender to deliberately inflict further head injuries to the child's head days later, when frank evidence of the injury to his face and nose was still obvious, adds to the gravity of his offending.  
Objective seriousness
34As assessment of the objective seriousness of this offence is an essential part of the sentencing exercise.  That assessment is undertaken referable to the nature of the offending (taking into account any statutory aggravating or mitigating factors) and not circumstances personal to the offender or any explanation for criminal conduct that may be able to be divined from his subjective circumstances.  
35The unlawful taking of a human life has always been regarded by sentencing courts as a most serious crime and one which the community is entitled to expect will attract a proper and proportionate punishment.  It has also been long recognised that the circumstances that give rise to a conviction for manslaughter, and the degree of culpability in offending of that kind, vary to such an extent that it is not possible to apply any standard or tariff in the imposition of sentence.  Each case must be considered referable to its own facts.  In cases of manslaughter involving the death of a child, I acknowledge that particular care must be taken when comparing the sentences imposed in other cases since, even where a child has been killed in a violent attack, an identifiable sentencing range or pattern is not discernable despite the sense of outrage that cases of that kind will inevitably attract and the fact that retribution must play a prominent part in the sentencing exercise (see R v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184; 147 A Crim R 520 at [42]).   
36Given the factual findings I have made as to the cause of death, and having taken care to isolate and characterise the injuries that can be attributed to the offender, the killing of this child, and what I am satisfied is a dearth of any factors that mitigate the seriousness of the offending and at least one factor that aggravates it, are such as to justify it being treated as a serious offence of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. 
37The factor that serves to aggravate the offending as provided for in s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is by reason of the fact that the offender was in a position of trust and authority after he assumed control of Bailey for the purpose of bathing him.  Although not a feature that operates as a statutory aggravating factor, I also take into account in considering the objective seriousness of the offence that on the night Bailey was fatally assaulted he was particularly vulnerable and defenceless given his ill health and the fact that he was recovering from head injuries sustained a few days earlier.  
38Consistent with finding there was no deliberate attempt to drown the child, I am satisfied that there was no infliction of gratuitous cruelty in the course of the assaults (see R v Clare [2006] NSWSC 812).  I am also satisfied that the violence to which Bailey was subjected, although considerable, was neither sustained nor premeditated.  In combination, these findings operate to characterise the case as falling short of a worst case (see R v Webb [2002] NSWSC 618 at [40]).  As to the level of violence that was involved, I note that although the multiple blows delivered to Bailey's head caused serious head injuries of the kind I have described, they were not sufficient to fracture his skull or to cause demonstrable brain damage.  Similarly, the force of the blow to the child's abdomen causing internal bleeding, whilst also considerable, was not sufficient to rupture or tear internal organs.  These are features distinguishing this case from a number of cases involving the death of a child by unlawful and dangerous act to which I was referred, which also justify this case being distinguished from a worst case (see Hoerler).
Subjective circumstances
39The offender relied upon a report from Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, dated 30 March 2013 based upon an interview on 21 March 2013 and a report form Anna Robilliard, forensic psychologist, dated 28 March 2013.  She interviewed the offender on 15 March 2013.
40The offender is the third born of seven siblings.  He left school after completing Year 7 after which he worked with his father shooting feral pigs and goats, fencing and wood cutting.  He also worked for six months as a stockman and in a number of supermarkets.  He commenced Year 10 but left school within weeks.  He was in receipt of unemployment benefits at the time of the offence.  His family remains supportive of him.
41Both reports detail the offender's lengthy history of poly-substance abuse.  He first drank alcohol in his early teenage years and considered himself a heavy drinker by his late teens.  He revealed to both Ms Robilliard and Dr Furst that he was sexually abused by a close family friend when he was 13 or 14 years of age and that he started using cannabis when he was 15 to suppress the anger and confusion he felt as a result of that abuse.  His cannabis use escalated to the point where he was smoking about 4 grams per day at the time of the offence. 
42Following the death of his brother when the offender was 17, he started to use amphetamines and crystal methamphetamine to relieve his emotional distress.  His use of drugs resulted in a number of encounters with the criminal justice system in Queensland, the most serious of which was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2010 after he was refused access to a hotel, attracting a suspended sentence. 
43After a two-year relationship ended in 2010, at a time when he was working and apparently drug-free, the offender moved to Warren from Queensland.  He reported that with limited job opportunities in central New South Wales he relapsed into drug use.  It was around this time that he was introduced to Ms Constable. 
44On the day of the offence, the offender said that he was in ""binge mode"", having injected methamphetamine up to seven times in the 24 hours before the offence.  As Dr Furst observed, this is indicative of the offender's drug dependence at high levels of tolerance, with his conduct on the day of the offence and prior to that time indicating a progressively deteriorating level of social and behavioural function. 
45While I do not regard his criminal record as a matter of aggravation under s 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, it is clear beyond any doubt that his chronic drug use and, most particularly, his relapse into high levels of use after a period of abstinence in the months preceding the offence, triggered a display of anger and the infliction of unprovoked violence which resulted in Bailey's death.  While I have accepted that the offence was unplanned, his loss of temper and violent outbursts on other occasions when under the influence of drugs deprives him of any finding that this offence was wholly impulsive, or the result of a sudden loss of self-control, such as might have mitigated the objective seriousness of his offending.  
Remorse and Rehabilitation
46As I have already noted, the offender claims to have no memory of inflicting the injuries from which Bailey died.  Nevertheless, he told Dr Furst that he has accepted full responsibility for causing the child's death and that he deserves to be punished.  He said, ""One night on drugs can ruin your life and the lives of 20 other people"".  
47I do not accept that the offender's claimed for amnesia, asserted for the first time to Ms Robilliard after the plea was entered, is genuine.  It cannot be reconciled with the sustained lies he told to medical staff and police on the night the child died and for some weeks thereafter.  This diminishes the potential mitigating effect of his recent expressions of remorse and contrition.  I do not, however, disregard them entirely.  They are entitled to be afforded some weight.  In addition, in the course of the interviews with both Dr Furst and Ms Robilliard, I accept that the offender made no attempt to minimise or rationalise the seriousness of his offending and that he has gained some insight into the catastrophic impact of his use of prohibited drugs, an addiction that had progressively consumed his life and which I consider to be the dominant environmental factor involved in the death of this child.  
48The offender has expressed a willingness to engage in drug and alcohol counselling while in custody, and welcomes participation in a structured rehabilitation program following his release.  I note he has actively participated in various rehabilitative programs since his remand almost two years ago.  
49Ms Robilliard concluded that with appropriate rehabilitation and ongoing adherence to his stated goal of abstinence from drugs and alcohol, the offender has good prosects of rehabilitation.  Dr Furst considered that the offender has the capacity to remain abstinent from drugs, and to make further positive changes in his life with drug and alcohol counselling and counselling to address his history of childhood sexual abuse.  He advised that the offender receive vocational rehabilitation and that his education options be explored whilst in custody to improve his prospects of making the ultimate transition into the community.
50Although there is some evidence to suggest that because he is to be sentenced for the manslaughter of a child, and the protection afforded prisoners in that category of offender, he will be imprisoned in conditions more onerous than other offenders, I do not consider it is of sufficient weight to ameliorate the sentence to be imposed.  There is no evidence to support a finding that he will not have access to prison-based services directed to his rehabilitation in keeping with the programs he has participated in to date.
51Necessarily, the views of both Dr Furst and Ms Robilliard are predictive.  In the relatively drug-free environment of the prison, the capacity of the offender to remain abstinent is untested and will remain untested for some years as he serves the mandatory period in custody that I will impose.  I have concluded, however, that he is not without prospects of rehabilitation and that were he to remain drug-free he is unlikely to act violently in the future.  These are matters that are entitled to some weight on sentence in his favour.  I am conscious, however, that they must not overwhelm the need for general deterrence to be reflected in the sentence to be imposed for what I am satisfied is very grave offending. 
52I have been referred to a schedule of sentences imposed following a plea of guilty to the manslaughter of a child and said by the offender's counsel to bear some similarity to this case (R v Ditfort (Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 March 1992, unreported); R v Bilton [2000] NSWSC 1113; R v Recalde [2000] NSWSC 1247; R v Compton [2008] NSWSC 204; R v Shepherd [2010] NSWSC 154).  I note that in Compton Studdert AJ was also referred to many of the same cases as was the Court in Hoerler.  In that case, as I have already noted, Spigelman CJ warned against cases used for comparative purposes fixing a tariff as distinct from those cases being some guide referable to which the sentence under consideration should be fixed.  
53I have given consideration to the sentences imposed in other cases from which I have gained some limited assistance.  I do not propose to record the facts of those cases or the sentences imposed save as to note some comparable features, namely the fact of drug use precipitating a loss of temper and the infliction of violence causative of death, fatal assaults to a child's head and abdomen, although in each of those cases the level of violence was greater and sustained over a longer period than in this case, and medical attention was either not sought at all or delayed.  In each case, as here, lies were told to conceal guilt (see Shepherd).  In none of the cases referred to above did the offender's subjective circumstances figure prominently as warranting any mitigation of sentence, and even less so far as this offender is concerned.  
The victim impact statements
54I have received victim impact statements from Bailey's maternal and paternal grandmothers.  They both read their statements in open court.  I also received a statement from Bailey's mother and his father.
55The circumstances in which their son and grandson died has left a permanent scar on them as individuals and as a family, the ongoing effects of which they experience in different ways.  I can only hope that these proceedings will bring some sense of closure and that they are able, in time, to resume their lives with the untarnished memory of Bailey as a much loved son and grandson and not how he died.  While Bailey's family may expect to see their loss reflected in the sentence to be imposed, that is not the object of sentencing in our system of justice.  No sentence of imprisonment, whatever its length, can compensate for the loss of a loved one or even begin to address the grief and sadness that accompanies the loss of the life of a child.  I do, however, take the statements of the family into account in the way permitted by law (see MAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 226).  I extend my sincere and deepest sympathies to them.  
Sentence
56I was not invited to find special circumstances such as to disturb the statutory ratio in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  After taking into account the need for the sentence in this case to operate as both a general and specific deterrent and to meet the sentencing objectives of retribution and punishment while still affording the offender's rehabilitative prospects as a relatively young man some weight, I impose the following sentence:
Nathan William Forrest, you are convicted of the offence of the manslaughter of Bailey Constable.
I sentence you to imprisonment for 8 years commencing on 7 May 2011, comprised of a non-parole period of 6 years expiring on 6 May 2017, with a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 6 May 2019.

		19 April 2013",2013-04-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761308,ZZ v R [2013] NSWCCA 83,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J and the orders which he proposes.

2JOHNSON J: The Applicant, ZZ, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed by Freeman DCJ in the Sydney District Court on 17 June 2011. A pseudonym is used in this judgment to describe the Applicant because of evidence before the Court concerning his assistance to authorities with respect to matters unrelated to the offences for which he was sentenced. 

The Offences

3Following pleas of guilty, the Applicant was sentenced as follows:
 
 





Offence

Maximum Penalty and Standard Non-Parole Period (“SNPP”)

Sentence



Court Attendance Notice offence - Between 29 July 2009 and 10 August 2009 obtaining a valuable thing by deception contrary to s.178BA(1) Crimes Act 1900

Imprisonment for five years
No SNPP

Fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months commencing on 13 August 2010 and expiring on 12 February 2012.
 
Taken into account on sentence for this matter on a Form 1 were four charges of passing a valueless cheque contrary to s.178B Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty imprisonment for 12 months)


Count 1 - On 4 March 2010, having sexual intercourse without consent, knowing that the victim was not consenting, contrary to s.61I Crimes Act 1900

Maximum penalty imprisonment for 14 years with SNPP of seven years

Imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years and six months commencing on 13 August 2011 and expiring on 12 February 2016 with a balance of term of 18 months commencing on 13 February 2016 and expiring on 12 August 2017


Count 2 - On 4 March 2010, having sexual intercourse without consent, knowing that the victim was not consenting, in circumstances of aggravation in that he recklessly inflicted actual bodily harm to the victim at the time of the commission of the offence, contrary to s.61J(1) and (2)(a) Crimes Act 1900

Maximum penalty 20 years’ imprisonment with SNPP of 10 years

Imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of five years commencing on 13 August 2012 and expiring on 12 August 2017 with a balance of term of two years and six months commencing on 13 August 2017 and expiring on 12 February 2020.
 
Taken into account on sentence for this matter on a Form 1 was a charge of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s.61J(1) and (2)(a) Crimes Act 1900.

4The total effective sentence comprised an aggregate head sentence of nine years and six months with a non-parole period of seven years. The earliest date upon which the Applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 12 August 2017.

5In reaching these sentences, the sentencing Judge applied a combined 50% discount for the Applicant's pleas of guilty and his assistance to authorities.

Grounds of Appeal

6The Applicant's challenge was confined to the sentences passed for the sexual assault offences.

7The Applicant pressed the following grounds of appeal at the hearing before this Court:

(a) Ground 1 - The sentencing Judge erred in the assessment of the objective seriousness of Count 1.

(b) Ground 2 - The sentencing Judge erred in the way the applicable standard non-parole periods in respect of the sexual assault offences were taken into account.

(c) Ground 3 - The sentences in respect of the sexual assault offences are manifestly excessive.
 
Facts of Offences

8A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered on sentence. 

9The dishonesty offence under s.178BA(1) Crimes Act 1900, and the Form 1 offences taken into account on sentence on that matter, are quite separate from the sexual assault offences. It is sufficient to note that they relate to the dishonest obtaining from Cerrone Jewellers in 2009 of diamond jewellery worth $31,000.00 by the passing of four valueless cheques. As there is no challenge to this sentence or to the degree of accumulation for that offence, it is not necessary to expand upon the facts of that offending conduct. 

10The facts of the sexual offences may be described in the following way. In November 2009, the Applicant (then aged 33 years) and the victim (then aged 29 years) commenced an intimate relationship. By March 2010, the Applicant and the victim had discussed moving in together and marriage. 

11On the evening of 2 March 2010, the victim and the Applicant engaged in SMS conversations in which they discussed their proposed sexual activities the following evening. The sentencing Judge described the SMS messages accurately as ""the exchange of some sexually explicit and provocative text messages"" (ROS2). 

12On 3 March 2010, the victim and the Applicant checked into an apartment in the city. They had dinner and then bought some cocaine. They both drank significant quantities of alcohol and had several lines of cocaine.

Count 1

13At one stage during the evening, the Applicant and the victim went onto the apartment balcony. They engaged in consensual fellatio. The Applicant then asked the victim to drink his urine. The victim was unsure about this, but the Applicant urged her to ""just try it"". The Applicant then urinated in her mouth. 

14The victim, who was disgusted, pulled her mouth away from the Applicant's penis. As she pulled away, the Applicant pushed her mouth back to his penis. He placed both hands on the back of her head and forcefully pushed her head back towards his penis so that it entered her mouth. The victim opened the bottom of her mouth so that most of the urine would pour out. She was gagging and nearly vomiting. The Applicant kept his hand on the back of the victim's head, preventing her from getting away. 

15The victim tried to pull away, however the Applicant would not let go of her head. After he finished, the Applicant pulled his penis out of the victim's mouth and asked if she liked it. Not wanting to upset the Applicant, the victim replied that she could take it or leave it.

Further Events Before the Second Sexual Assault

16Further sexual activity then took place between the Applicant and the victim. She felt very intoxicated, and became increasingly distressed and uncomfortable. The victim was concerned that the Applicant would not stop having sex with her. Whilst the Applicant was penetrating her, the victim was fearful and telephoned a friend to tell her that ""everything is going wrong"" and that she was ""not OK"". 

17The victim then telephoned her mother and asked for help. She told her mother that the Applicant was raping her. During this conversation, the Applicant was digitally penetrating the victim's vagina and anus. 

Count 2

18The victim then ran towards the front door, planning to escape from the apartment.

19As she reached the front door, the victim screamed ""Help me!"". The Applicant came up behind her and grabbed her left arm, pulling her forcefully back inside the apartment and shutting the front door.

20The Applicant pushed the victim into the bathroom. He pushed her up against the bathroom wall and penetrated her anus with his penis so forcefully that she was pushed forward, smashing her head against tiles and suffering a deep four-centimetre laceration to her forehead. The Applicant continued to penetrate the victim's anus with his penis. Whilst the Applicant was penetrating the victim, the top of her head was crashing against the wall. The Applicant grabbed the victim by the hair and pulled it really hard so that her head lifted, whilst saying ""Lift your head, slut"". He then smashed her head against the wall. The victim felt dizzy and fell to the ground. The Applicant's penis slipped out of her anus. She felt that she must have lost consciousness, but then heard the Applicant say ""Get up, get up"". He grabbed the victim's arm to pull her up from the ground saying ""Get up, you filthy slut"". This conduct constituted Count 2 on the indictment.

Form 1 Offence on Count 2

21The Applicant pulled the victim to her feet and continued to push her against the wall. The victim could see a lot of blood on the ground and felt dizzy and sick in the stomach. She could not move.

22The Applicant pulled her up and again anally penetrated her with his penis. The victim did not want him to do this, but could not stop him. She was saying ""No, no, no"". This conduct gave rise to the Form 1 offence taken into account on sentence for Count 2. 

23The Applicant removed his penis from the victim's anus and walked her into the bedroom, where the victim looked into the mirror and saw blood on her face, and said ""What have you done to me?"" The Applicant said ""God that turns me on, let's go again, I'm as hard as"" whilst masturbating himself. 

Events After the Offences

24The victim started to cry and telephoned her mother. Whilst the victim was speaking to her mother and then her father on the mobile, the Applicant could be heard in the background prompting the victim to say that nothing was wrong. 

25The Applicant then told the victim ""I gotta get out of here"", as her parents had called ""000"". He started to dress himself. The victim's father had rung the Applicant, who stated, falsely, that he and the victim were in Kurri Kurri.

26The victim, naked and bleeding, escaped from the apartment screaming for help. The Applicant followed her, trying to get her back inside. Occupants of a neighbouring apartment came out and assisted the clearly distressed and injured victim.

27The male neighbour told the Applicant to ""back off and let her go"". Once inside the neighbour's apartment, the victim complained immediately ""He bashed my head up against the wall and he raped me"".

28The victim was taken to hospital by ambulance. On examination, doctors observed lacerations to the victim's face, including a deep y-shape laceration to her forehead, bruising to the arms and legs, abrasions to the labia minora and fossa navicularis and extensive injuries to the rectum, with bleeding and yellowish discharge.

29The following day, the Applicant rang the victim's mother and said to her ""Tell [the victim] to call the police off"". He also said that he did not remember what happened. 

30During a 30-minute period, the Applicant called the victim's mother four times, telling her he was going to commit suicide, and also stating that his mother had died that morning. He said ""Tell [the victim] to stop the police action, I need to grieve for my mum"". This was a lie. The Applicant's mother had not in fact passed away.

31An examination of the apartment by police revealed a large quantity of blood in the bathroom.

32Following discussions with police officers, not connected with this matter, the Applicant handed himself into police that afternoon.

33The Applicant was arrested on 5 March 2010 in respect of the sexual assault offences, and was refused bail. He has remained in continuous custody since that time. 

Effects of Offences on the Victim

34The victim read a victim impact statement before the District Court. In addition, a report of the victim's treating medical practitioner was tendered by the Crown.

35The medical evidence confirmed the significant physical injuries to the victim as a result of the sexual assault offences, together with ongoing psychological injury.

36The sentencing Judge made the following findings concerning the effects of Count 2, and the Form 1 offence, on the victim (ROS4-5):

""The injuries sustained by the victim are certainly at the higher end of actual bodily harm and merit the description of substantial as that term is used in s 21A(2), that is beyond the level necessary to sustain the infliction of actual bodily harm as being an essential element of the charge.

Dr Norrie who examined the victim shortly after the assault noted extensive injuries to the rectum, multiple bruises and lacerations to her forehead and nose. She sustained an injury to her shoulder which still requires treatment and she is still suffering from the physical sequelae of this assault. Likewise the psychological harm done to the victim is substantial and in my view despite the Crown's submission this is what would ordinarily be expected in a case such as this, namely an upper mid range offence, merits a finding that this harm is substantial.

The harm done is consistent in my view with what one would expect from a high range aggravated sexual assault. The victim is unemployed and apparently unemployable some sixteen months after the event. The prognosis in these circumstances must be guarded and the aggravating element of substantial harm is made out.""

37No challenge was made to these findings before this Court.

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances

38The Applicant was born in December 1975, and was 34 years' old at the time of the offences and 35 years at the time of sentence. 

39He has an extensive criminal history for offences of fraud and dishonesty extending back to 1994. He has served sentences of imprisonment for offences of that class in New South Wales and Victoria. 

40The Applicant has no prior history of sexual assault offences. 

41On 22 May 2008, the Applicant was released to parole in Victoria with respect to sentences imposed in 2003 for multiple counts of obtaining financial advantage by deception. His parole period (34 months) was to expire on 22 November 2011. A condition of the Applicant's parole order stated that he must not leave the State of Victoria, without the written permission of the relevant authorities. 

42On 22 January 2010, a private hearing of the NSW State Parole Authority revoked the Applicant's parole with effect from 5 January 2010. However, at a public hearing of the NSW State Parole Authority on 13 April 2010, the revocation was not confirmed, and the matter was stood over pending determination of the proceedings for sexual assault. No subsequent determination was made by the State Parole Authority. 

43The sentencing Judge determined that substantial justice would be done if the sentences commenced on 13 August 2010, a date upon which the Applicant made an unsuccessful bail application in the Supreme Court. A ground of appeal which sought to challenge the selection of the sentence commencement date was abandoned by the Applicant.

44The present offences were committed whilst the Applicant was subject to parole. However, applying Morrison v R [2009] NSWCCA 211; 197 A Crim R 103 at 113-114 [43]-[45], the sentencing Judge accepted that the Applicant was not then on ""conditional liberty"" for the purpose of s.21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

45The sentencing Judge accepted that the Applicant was intelligent and held certain tertiary qualifications.

46His Honour noted that the Applicant had been declared bankrupt in 1996 and had again been made bankrupt in 2010.

47The Applicant's father gave short evidence at the sentencing hearing. The Applicant did not give evidence.

48Included in the documentary evidence before the sentencing court were a presentence report and a risk assessment report prepared by officers of the Sex and Violent Offender Therapeutic Programs, Forensic Psychology Services within the Department of Corrective Services. The Applicant was placed in the moderate-low risk category on application of the STATIC-99R risk assessment. 

49As mentioned earlier, the sentencing Judge gave a combined 50% discount for the Applicant's pleas of guilty and his assistance to the authorities. The assistance comprised both past assistance and an undertaking to give evidence (ROS8).

Ground 1 - Suggested Error in the Assessment of the Objective Seriousness of Count 1

Submissions of the Parties

50Mr Odgers SC, for the Applicant, submitted that the sentencing Judge had fallen into error in his characterisation of the objective seriousness of Count 1.

51In the District Court, the Crown submitted that the conduct of forced fellatio, combined with urination by the Applicant in the victim's mouth, placed Count 1 ""at the mid range of seriousness for an offence of this kind"", involving an act of gross degradation of the victim. 

52Senior counsel appearing for the Applicant in the District Court (not Mr Odgers SC) noted the Crown submission in this regard and did not contest it (T8, 26 May 2011). 

53The sentencing Judge accepted the Crown submission concerning the classification of this offence as ""being in the mid range of seriousness"" (ROS3). However, when considering the relevance of the standard non-parole period, his Honour said (with respect to Counts 1 and 2) that given ""the assessment I have made of the criminality of the offender's action being at the top of the mid range, the sentences after trial would have been greater than the standard"" (ROS13).

54Mr Odgers SC submitted that the latter reference related to the assessment of objective seriousness of Count 2, and not Count 1. The sentencing Judge had accepted that Count 2 represented ""conduct in the upper mid range of objective seriousness for an offence of this kind"" (ROS4), this being the common submission for the Crown and the Applicant at first instance. Accordingly, Mr Odgers SC submitted that error was demonstrated.

55The Crown acknowledged the difference between his Honour's specific reference to the objective seriousness of Count 1, and the later apparently rolled-up reference to the objective seriousness of both counts expressed at a higher level of seriousness. 

56The Crown noted that the sentencing Judge had directed a substantial degree of concurrency as between Counts 1 and 2 and submitted that, even if the sentence on Count 1 was reduced to reflect the sentencing Judge's finding of mid-range objective seriousness, considerations of totality should lead to the proper level of accumulation remaining at 12 months. 

57In this way, the Crown submitted that no lesser aggregate sentence was warranted at law.

Decision

58It is necessary to fairly read the remarks on sentence to determine whether an error has been made and, if so, to determine the extent and consequences of the error.

59In many circumstances, it might be considered that the second reference by the sentencing Judge (at ROS13) was a slip, with his Honour's true finding being that made earlier in the remarks. 

60However, the non-parole period for Count 1, after a 50% combined discount for the Applicant's plea of guilty and assistance, was a period of four years and six months. The standard non-parole period for this offence was seven years. An undiscounted non-parole period would have been in the order of nine years.

61In these circumstances, it is appropriate to conclude that his Honour sentenced the Applicant on Count 1 upon the basis of the second (and incorrect) assessment, and not the first assessment identified earlier in the remarks.

62The first ground of appeal is made good. It will be necessary to return to this topic later in this judgment, and to consider the Crown submission concerning accumulation, in the course of determining what course this Court should take, for the purposes of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

Ground 2 - Claim of Error in Taking Into Account the Standard Non-Parole Periods for the Sexual Assault Offences

63It is appropriate to consider submissions made with respect to the second ground of appeal. This process will also assist a decision whether this Court should intervene under s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, in light of the error established in the first ground of appeal.

Submissions for the Applicant

64Mr Odgers SC submitted that the sentencing Judge had fallen into error in taking into account the standard non-parole period with respect to Counts 1 and 2. He submitted that the sentencing Judge's approach infringed the principles laid down by the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. 

65Mention has been made earlier of the sentencing Judge's finding concerning Counts 1 and 2 (at [53] above).
 
66The part of the remarks on sentence challenged, in the second ground of appeal, is as follows (ROS13):

""The standard non parole period is not a maximum. It is not applicable automatically because of the offender's plea of guilty (Way's case). Given the assessment I have made of the criminality of the offender's action being at the top of the mid range, the sentences after trial would have been greater than the standard. The sentences then are as follows.""

67His Honour then proceeded to pass sentences identified earlier in this judgment. 

68In support of the second ground of appeal, Mr Odgers SC submitted that the sentencing Judge's approach involved error for two reasons. Firstly, he submitted that it involved impermissible two-stage sentencing, where the sentencing Judge considered the application of the standard non-parole period by reference to the objective seriousness of the subject offence, and then added an increment to the standard non-parole period (in this case, before discount, an extra two years in the case of Count 1).

69It was submitted that the same error had been made with respect to Count 2, with the consequence that the starting point sentence that should be imposed (before taking into account the combined discount for the Applicant's plea and assistance) was one year and three months above the standard non-parole period of 10 years.

70In respect of both Counts 1 and 2, Mr Odgers SC submitted there was a further error. He submitted that the sentencing Judge appears to have given no weight to matters personal to the Applicant (other than the combined discount for his pleas and assistance) as distinct from the ""objective seriousness"" of the offences. That conclusion flowed, it was submitted, from the starting point non-parole periods. If they were based on a view that the objective seriousness of the offences was ""at the top of the mid range"", it was impossible to see that any mitigating effect was given to other factors bearing on sentence.

71In this way, Mr Odgers SC submitted that his Honour had failed completely to engage in the required instinctive synthesis of relevant factors, with the standard non-parole period operating as a guidepost: Muldrock v The Queen at 132 [28]. 

72In particular, it was submitted that a number of favourable findings by the sentencing Judge were not taken into account, including the finding that the sexual offences were ""out of character"" (ROS10), and that the Applicant was ""completely disinhibited"" when committing the sexual offences which ""may be the result of his gross abuse of alcohol and his use of cocaine"" (ROS11). 

73Mr Odgers SC submitted that the offences should be approached upon the basis that the Applicant was reckless as to the victim's lack of consent, but that it had not been established beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant had actual knowledge of the victim's lack of consent. 

74With respect to the Applicant's intoxication, it was submitted that this was an unusual case where intoxication mitigates the Applicant's offences because he acted out of character by reason of intoxication: R v Coleman (1990) 47 A Crim R 306 at 320. It was submitted that there was reduced need for specific deterrence and enhanced prospects of rehabilitation in these circumstances, together with a need for greater emphasis to be given to rehabilitation than general deterrence.

75Mr Odgers SC submitted that there was evidence of contrition and remorse before the sentencing Judge. He submitted that all these matters should have been taken into account in the Applicant's favour, as part of a process of instinctive synthesis prior to the determination of sentence, including the non-parole period, but that it appears that none were. 

76In approaching the matter in this way, it was submitted that the head sentence and non-parole period for each offence would have commenced at a significantly lower level than those identified by the sentencing Judge, before the 50% combined discount was factored in.

77In these ways, the Applicant submitted that error had been demonstrated on the part of the sentencing Judge.

Crown Submissions

78The Crown submitted that, whilst Muldrock v The Queen constituted a radical departure from sentencing practices in this State, merely showing that a Judge had sentenced in a manner which followed the approach prescribed in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 will not be sufficient to demonstrate error. 

79It was submitted that what must be ascertained in each case is whether reliance on R v Way has sufficiently infected the sentence with such error that this Court must intervene: Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 at [26].

80Given the conceded error concerning Count 1, the Crown did not direct submissions under this ground to that offence.

81With respect to Count 2, the Crown submitted that it was necessary to keep in mind the Form 1 offence, a serious offence under s.61J Crimes Act 1900 involving anal penetration accompanied by actual bodily harm, which led to the imposition of a longer sentence than would have been appropriate had Count 2 stood alone.

82It was submitted, as well, that s.23(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 required a sentence imposed upon an offender who had assisted the authorities to not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offending. Given the gravity of the two s.61J offences, the Crown submitted that a non-parole period of less than five years and six months would not adequately reflect the criminality of the offending.

83With respect to the finding that the sexual offences are ""out of character"", the Crown submitted that the nature and extent of the Applicant's sexual offences must be kept in mind. It was submitted that the statement that the offences were ""out of character"" was not a matter which greatly assisted the Applicant and that the sentencing Judge had given it proper weight.

84With respect to the submission that the Applicant should be sentenced upon the basis of recklessness as to consent, and not knowledge of lack of consent, the Crown submitted that knowledge of lack of consent was the appropriate finding. The Crown relied upon the victim's immediate resistance during the conduct giving rise to Count 1, and her telephone calls for help and her attempted flight from the apartment, accompanied by screams, as being clear and obvious indicators to the Applicant of her lack of consent. 

85To the extent that it was submitted for the Applicant that his comments to the victim (see [23] above) suggested a belief on his part that the victim was consenting and enjoying the activity, the Crown submitted that the Applicant's comments were more indicative of his own satisfaction at the victim's expense, arising from clearly non-consensual sexual assaults.

86With respect to the Applicant's intoxication, the Crown submitted that this aspect did not assist him on sentence by application of common law sentencing principles, in particular given his actual knowledge of the victim's lack of consent.

87To the extent that the Applicant relied upon the context in which the offences occurred, commencing with consensual activity with both parties intoxicated, the Crown submitted that this did not assist the Applicant in circumstances where the victim had made entirely clear, in a number of ways, her lack of consent to the activity which constituted the offences.

88The Crown submitted that self-induced intoxication in a mature man increases rather than decreases his moral culpability for the predictable consequences of that choice: Bourke v R [2010] NSWCCA 22; 199 A Crim R 38 at 44 [28]; R v Mendes [2012] NSWCCA 103 at [83]. 

89It was submitted that the sentencing Judge's neutral approach to the Applicant's intoxication was in fact generous to the Applicant.

90With respect to contrition and remorse, the Crown submitted that the Applicant's letter of apology carried no weight. The Applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings, and no submission was made in the District Court concerning remorse, so that no error had been demonstrated in this respect.

91The Crown submitted that, given the objective gravity of Count 2 and the Form 1 matter to be taken into account on sentence for this matter, no error had been demonstrated in accordance with the second ground of appeal concerning this count.

Decision

92There is force in the Applicant's submission that the sentencing Judge's approach to the standard non-parole period with respect to both sexual assault offences was unduly prescriptive, in light of the principles laid down subsequently in Muldrock v The Queen. 

93A fair reading of his Honour's remarks on sentence (see [66] above) supports a conclusion that the standard non-parole period played a greater role on sentence than as a guidepost, to be taken into account with other factors on sentence, arising from application of Muldrock v The Queen. His Honour's approach was indicative of one which involved giving the standard non-parole period undue significance, in an overly prescriptive way: Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 at [31]; Truong v R [2013] NSWCCA 36 at [32]. The process of reasoning was rigid to the point of being inconsistent with Muldrock v The Queen: Truong v R at [34].

94I am satisfied that what occurred here was, in truth, a form of two-stage sentencing which is not permissible in view of the decision in Muldrock v The Queen. The first submission advanced as part of the second ground of appeal should be upheld.

95The second submission advanced under this ground involves an examination of aspects of the offences with the view to determining whether the sentencing Judge took them into account on sentence. In view of the findings which have been made concerning the first ground of appeal and the first submission advanced in support of the second ground of appeal, it is unproductive to consider further the separate aspects of the ground. In my view, the appropriate course is to move to consideration of the question whether lesser sentences should be imposed for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. This process will involve an examination of factors relevant to sentence to permit the statutory question to be answered.

96The third ground of appeal, a claim of manifest excess, should be put to one side for the moment as well. The process to be undertaken will allow conclusions to be reached with respect to the third ground of appeal as well as the determination of the s.6(3) issue. 

Should Lesser Sentences on Counts 1 and 2 be Passed for the Purposes of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912?

97Under s.6(3), the Court re-exercises the statutory discretion taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles, with a view to formulating the positive opinion for which the subsection provides: Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 at 287 [19].

98The process to be undertaken is one of instinctive synthesis, having regard to the objective gravity of the Applicant's offences, his subjective circumstances and other aspects which bear upon the question of sentence, including the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period for each of Counts 1 and 2. In addition, it will be necessary to bear in mind the Form 1 offence to be taken into account in passing sentence on Count 2. 

99The objective gravity of the Applicant's offences needs to be assessed in the context of the relationship between the Applicant and the victim. In R v Mason [2001] VSCA 62, Winneke P (Tadgell and Buchanan JJA agreeing) said at [7]-[8]:

""[7] A rape committed in the context, and against the background, of a previous settled relationship may in certain circumstances be a factor which a court can take into account in mitigation where it can be seen that the impact upon the victim has, for that reason, been less traumatic than otherwise it might have been. But, equally, it is not difficult to imagine a rape, committed by a man who has been in a previous relationship with his victim, which would be every bit as frightening as a rape committed by a stranger. The one thing which the authorities to which this Court has been referred demonstrate is that the crime of rape, whatever the circumstances, and upon whomsoever committed, is regarded by the courts as a grave insult to its victim and a crime which can rarely give rise to a non-custodial sentence [Schubert [1999] VSCA 25; Latham [1999] VSCA 132].

[8] It should not be forgotten that the crime of rape is an intensely personal crime which, for sentencing purposes, cannot be divorced from its effects on the victim. But the effects include not only those which flow from the physical invasion of the victim's person and security, but also those which flow from the violation of the more intangible intellectual properties of the victim's rights and freedoms. In a society in which there is an increasing number of couples becoming estranged, the courts have a heightened obligation to deter those who have previously lived in a stable relationship with a wife or partner from regarding such wife or partner as akin to a chattel devoid of rights or freedoms, and as an object readily available for their sexual gratification.""

100The decision in R v Mason was referred to by this Court in NM v R [2012] NSWCCA 215, where Macfarlan JA (McCallum J and Grove AJ agreeing) said at [59]-[60]:

""[59] In the present case, the complainant suffered considerable pain as a result of the forced anal intercourse and her text messages of 1 and 2 May 2009 indicate that she suffered considerable emotional trauma as a result of the sexual assaults. However, in light of her lengthy prior sexual relationship with the appellant and the intermittent sexual relationship that still existed at the time of the offences, I do not consider that the offences can be equated to those involving sexual assaults by strangers, which must almost inevitably give rise to extreme terror and fear in the mind of the victim. Here, the victim had been prepared until moments before the assaults to have sexual intercourse with the appellant, and the complainant had indeed, only three minutes before the appellant's arrival at her home, invited him over for that very purpose. My view is that in these circumstances the sentencing judge erred in characterising the offences as falling within the mid-range of seriousness. They were in my view well below that, although not at the bottom of the range.

[60] These comments are in no way intended to suggest that the appellant's offences were not serious. He committed serious criminal offences deserving of severe punishment. However, the sentences that the sentencing judge imposed, amounting to an overall sentence of nine and a half years with a non-parole period of six and a half years, were in my view manifestly excessive in light of the particular circumstances of the case.""

101In the present case, the Applicant and the victim were in a relationship and the events on the evening of 3-4 March 2010 commenced as a consensual sexual episode. However, the conduct of the Applicant giving rise to Count 1 involved movement of the encounter to a different form of sexual activity, with the victim demonstrating obviously her lack of agreement to the conduct which the Applicant found sexually exciting. 

102Thereafter, the Applicant physically attacked the victim in a manner which involved forced anal intercourse carried out with such a measure of violence that the victim's head was smashed against tiles causing significant injury to her. At the same time, the Applicant was speaking to the victim in a manner which emphasised the degrading, violent physical exploitation of her, with the Applicant demonstrating no concern for her wellbeing. 

103It is true that the victim was not being sexually assaulted by a stranger, in circumstances where a further element of terror and fear would be expected. However, what was expected to be a consensual sexual encounter with the Applicant, spun out of control because of the Applicant's violent and self-centred approach in a way that clearly struck fear into the victim and caused her significant injury. The fact that the victim knew the Applicant and had, until these events, no doubt trusted him, could provide little comfort when the Applicant launched the onslaught against her revealed in the agreed facts.

104Count 2 (and the Form 1 offence) involved significant domestic violence offences. The fact that the offences occurred in a domestic context (as distinct from an attack by a stranger) does not lessen their gravity: Heine v R [2008] NSWCCA 61 at [40].

105The offences involved the exercise by the Applicant of control and power over the victim, in violation of the trust that existed between them: R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; 164 A Crim R 179 at 193 [77].

106The victim suffered substantial injuries with long-lasting consequences (see [36] above).

107The context of the relationship between the parties, in a case such as this involving significant violence and the infliction of injury, provides no real assistance to an offender on sentence. 
 
108Before moving to consider the relevance of the Applicant's intoxication, it is helpful to set out the sentencing Judge's findings in this regard (ROS7):

""It is convenient at this point to consider the subjective case made on behalf of the offender. He is now aged thirty-five with, as I said, a history of repeated offending in terms of dishonesty. Whenever given an opportunity in the past by way of bond or parole he has breached his obligations and ended up in prison. Such a record does not generate confidence in his ability to reform. The sexual offences are out of character but he will still require moderate intervention to address this type of offending and a long sexual offender's program is recommended.

There is no evidence that the offender suffers from any abnormality of mind. His actions on 4 March 2010 were completely disinhibited but this may be the result of his gross abuse of alcohol and his use of cocaine which he had been consuming in increasing quantities prior to that occasion. He will require drug and alcohol counselling as well. This is not his first time in prison. His family remain, he says, supportive but he still tends to minimise his role in these crimes.""

109The Applicant and the victim had consumed alcohol and cocaine so that both were affected by those substances. However, what followed involved a sustained physical and sexual attack by the Applicant upon the victim.

110In R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240 at [78]-[82], this Court adopted and applied the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Hasan v R [2010] VSCA 352; 31 VR 28 with respect to the very limited relevance of self-induced intoxication to sentencing for offences of violence, including sexual assault. It was said in R v GWM at [78] that ""voluntary intoxication operates rarely (at best) to mitigate penalty"". The ""out of character"" exception is ""acknowledged to exist, but it has almost never been applied"": Hasan v R at 33 [21]; R v GWM at [80]-[81].

111In Hasan v R, Maxwell P, Redlich and Harper JJA said at 37 [33]-[34] (footnotes excluded):

""[33] Because the out of character exception has been so rarely applied, there has been almost no judicial exploration of the circumstances in which the exception might be applicable. It seems clear enough, however, that the circumstances must be quite exceptional before intoxication at the time of offending can mitigate the offender's moral culpability.

[34] On ordinary principles, the offender would bear the onus of showing that he/she did not know what effect alcohol would have on him/her. Given the widespread use of alcohol, and the fact that even a non-drinker would be well aware of its effects on a person who becomes intoxicated, this is doubtless a difficult burden to discharge. Moreover, an attempt to invoke the exception also carries with it the forensic risk that an investigation of the offender's drinking habits might lead to the conclusion that the state of intoxication was an aggravating rather than a mitigating circumstance.""

112Properly understood, in accordance with the principles in Hasan v R, the ""out of character"" concept is a narrow one which has rare application: R v GWM at [82]. This conclusion is supported by other decisions of this Court, including Stanford v R [2007] NSWCCA 73; Bourke v R at 44 [26], [28] and BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159; 201 A Crim R 379 at 392 [55], 397 [79].

113In my view, these principles have equal application to the present case. It may be said that the Applicant's level of intoxication served to disinhibit him. At the same time, the Applicant's offences, and in particular Count 2 (and the Form 1 offence on Count 2), involved acts of substantial violence injuring the victim, in the context of clearly communicated lack of consent by her to the sexual acts being committed against her. The intoxication of the Applicant provides no real assistance to him on sentence. 

114Further, the Applicant was not a person of previous good character. He was a significant recidivist in the area of crimes of fraud and dishonesty. It could certainly be said that he had no prior offences of sexual assault. But that is as far as an ""out of character"" finding could go, and (in my view) that is as far as the sentencing Judge intended to go (see [108] above). And there were, of course, further dishonesty offences for which the Applicant was to be sentenced in the District Court.

115The sexual assault offences contained in Counts 1 and 2 were objectively grave. At the hearing before this Court, Mr Odgers SC sought to advance a submission that concessions made by his predecessor in the District Court, with respect to the objective seriousness of the offences, were not correct. The very experienced senior counsel appearing for the Applicant at first instance had expressly agreed with the Crown submission that Count 1 lay at the mid-range of seriousness for an offence of this kind, and that Count 2 represented conduct in the upper mid-range of objective seriousness for an offence of this kind. 

116This Court should not lightly allow a concession made at first instance to be replaced by a different argument advanced by new counsel on appeal: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [81]. This principle applies as much to the s.6(3) stage of an appeal as to the initial question whether error has been established. In any event, in my view, the submissions advanced by the Crown, and accepted by senior counsel for the Applicant in the District Court, were correct. 

117It was submitted for the Applicant in this Court that, in approaching the question of resentence, the Court should proceed upon the basis that the Applicant was reckless concerning the victim's lack of consent, rather than that he had knowledge of lack of consent. I do not accept this submission. 

118No such submission had been advanced at first instance. Moreover, the description of the offence in Count 1 in the Agreed Statement of Facts demonstrates that the actions of the victim communicated her lack of consent in an unmistakable way, and I am satisfied that the Applicant knew this at the time. 

119With respect to Count 2, the Applicant maintained his violent sexual pursuit of the victim, culminating in conduct described earlier in this judgment. These acts occurred against the background of the victim's clear communication of lack of consent to the Applicant's conduct which gave rise to Count 1. Once again, I am satisfied that the appropriate basis for sentence of the Applicant is knowledge of lack of consent concerning Count 2, and not recklessness. 

120The Applicant could have had no doubt that the victim was not consenting to these sexual acts. The degree of violence, the insults and the victim's protests (including an attempt to escape before Count 2) made it plain beyond any doubt that she was not consenting to this conduct: R v Stephens (1994) 76 A Crim R 5 at 7.

121It is true that the SMS messages exchanged between the Applicant and the victim prior to events in the apartment had foreshadowed certain sexual activities. However, what may have been forecast as a form of sexual frolic quickly became a forceful and violent onslaught against the victim, to which she was clearly and obviously not consenting. 

122The Applicant's words expressed at one point (see [23] above) are indicative of his own one-sided approach to what was then an obvious sexual assault, disclosing his enjoyment of acts which degraded and injured the victim in a number of serious respects. 

123These were acts of knowing exploitation by the Applicant. His acts involved the subjugation, debasement and humiliation of the victim, including urination in the victim's mouth: R v Mosegaard [2005] NSWCCA 361 at [168]ff.

124The sentencing Judge found that the Applicant still tended ""to minimise his role in these crimes"" (see [108] above), a finding that, in my view, was both open and correct. Further, the Applicant has a long history of recidivism with respect to dishonesty offences, including a chequered history of compliance with parole conditions and other sentencing orders. The fact that the Applicant has breached parole is relevant to an assessment of his rehabilitation prospects and the need for personal deterrence: Morrison v R at 114 [15].

125The sentencing Judge proceeded upon the basis that a combined discount of 50% for the Applicant's plea of guilty and assistance should be allowed. It was not submitted that this Court should take a different approach if the Applicant came to be resentenced.

126The Crown reminded the Court of the note of caution expressed in earlier decisions where an argument is sought to be based upon the starting point or notional sentence rather than the sentence actually passed, in particular, in cases where a significant discount for assistance has applied: Graham v R [2009] NSWCCA 212 at [40]-[45]; Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49 at [63]. However, this does not mean that reference to the starting point cannot assist the Court in assessing the submissions made. 

127In this case, the offence in Count 1 attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years, with a standard non-parole period of seven years. Prior to the application of the 50% discount, the sentence comprised a head sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of nine years.

128The offence in Count 2 attracted a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. Before application of the 50% discount, and taking into account the Form 1 matter, the head sentence was one of 15 years with a non-parole period of 10 years (11 years and three months before the adjustment for ""special circumstances"").

129The recital of these periods assists the Applicant's submission, particularly with respect to the sentence for Count 1.

130As mentioned above (at [97]-[98]), the s.6(3) test requires this Court to approach the question of sentence on these counts again.

131The process of instinctive synthesis to be undertaken by a sentencing court involves the sentencing Judge identifying all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, and then making a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence in all the circumstances of the case: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 377-378 [51]; Muldrock v The Queen at 131-132 [26].

132For each offence, the standard non-parole period is to be taken into account, with the maximum penalty, as ""two legislative guideposts"" which are relevant to sentence: Muldrock v The Queen at 132 [27].

133It must be kept in mind, however, that a lesser penalty imposed because of assistance to law enforcement authorities must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence: s.23(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. There is a bottom line beneath which a sentence cannot be set legitimately: SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 at 251 [4]-[6]. This consideration is an important one in this case, in determining the question of sentence for the sexual assault offences.

134A significant offence is included on the Form 1 to be taken into account on sentence for Count 2, this being a further part of the episodes of sexual assault and violence directed by the Applicant towards the victim.

135Having considered relevant factors, for the purpose of s.6(3), I am satisfied that lesser sentences are warranted on Counts 1 and 2.

136Both Counts 1 and 2 warrant substantial sentences to reflect their significant objective gravity. The sentence on Count 1 is affected by two errors. Application of s.6(3) to that offence will see a greater reduction in sentence than on Count 2. The latter offence (and the Form 1 matter) are particularly serious examples of this class of offence.

137To my mind, before application of the 50% discount, an appropriate sentence on Count 1 would comprise a head sentence of nine years. Application of the statutory ratio would see a non-parole period of six years and nine months. 

138Before application of the 50% discount, an appropriate sentence on Count 2 (taking into account the offence on the Form 1), would comprise a head sentence of 14 years. Application of the statutory ratio would see a non-parole period of 10 years and six months. 

139After application of the 50% discount, the sentence for Count 1 would comprise a non-parole period of three years, four months and two weeks, with a balance of term of one year, one month and two weeks.

140After application of the 50% discount, the sentence for Count 2 (including the Form 1 offence), would comprise a non-parole period of five years and three months with a balance of term of one year and nine months. 

141In my view, a period of 12 months' accumulation as between Counts 1 and 2, as determined by the sentencing Judge, remains appropriate to reflect principles of concurrency, accumulation and totality. 

142Like the sentencing Judge, I would find special circumstances only as a result of the level of accumulation of the sentences. 

143To give effect to this limited finding of special circumstances, the sentence to be passed for Count 2 will comprise a non-parole period of four years and eight months, with a balance of term of two years and four months.

144To my mind, no lesser sentences than these are appropriate having regard to s.23(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the principles in SZ v R (see [133] above). For the purposes of s.23(4), the discount for assistance (of 25%) is apportioned, with 12.5% for past assistance and 12.5% for future assistance.

145The commencement date for the sentence on Count 1 should remain as 13 August 2011. 

146Two observations are appropriate before moving to the orders which I propose. 

147Firstly, although the Applicant has demonstrated error with respect to Counts 1 and 2, and has made good an argument that lesser sentences should be imposed for the purposes of s.6(3), it will be observed that relatively modest reductions have been made to the sentences, in particular for Count 2. Further, the maintenance of the level of accumulation of one year means that there is no practical change resulting from the reduction of the sentence on Count 1. The sentence imposed on Count 2 results in an effective reduction of six months in the head sentence and four months in the non-parole period. These sentences result from the passing of sentences according to law. Although this Court should guard against tinkering with sentences, I do not consider that the course proposed here may be so characterised: cf Hillier v Director of Public Prosecutions [2009] NSWCCA 312; 198 A Crim R 565 at 576-577 [47]-[49]; Jackson v R [2013] VSCA 14 at [36].

148Secondly, the conclusions expressed in this judgment reveal that the Applicant's claim of manifest excess has not been made good. The sentences have not been demonstrated to be unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen at 370-371 [25].

149I propose the following orders:

(a) leave to appeal granted;

(b) appeal allowed in part;

(c) confirm sentence passed on 17 June 2011 for the offence of obtaining a valuable thing by deception (taking into account the Form 1 offences referrable to this count);

(d) sentences for the offences under s.61I and s.61J Crimes Act 1900 quashed;

(e) in their place:

(i) for Count 1, the offence of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s.61I Crimes Act 1900, the Applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years, four months and two weeks commencing on 13 August 2011 and expiring on 26 December 2014, with a balance of term of one year, one month and two weeks commencing on 27 December 2014 and expiring on 9 February 2016,

2761310,R v Ray (No 1) [2013] NSWSC 585,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  The Crown alleges that the accused murdered Ms Priscilla Perry in a unit at The Entrance on 9 April 2011.  Ms Perry had leased that unit jointly with Ms Shantell Dargan in February 2011.  There will be evidence that the accused had been staying regularly with Ms Dargan at the unit from about the time it was leased up until 9 April 2011.
2The Crown proposes to lead evidence of the fact that at the time of the alleged offence the accused was the subject of an apprehended domestic violence order (""ADVO""), which had been made on 3 May 2010 and was in force for a period of two years.  The order included conditions that he not go within 100 metres of premises where Shantell Dargan worked or lived and that he not approach or contact Shantell Dargan.
3The Crown contends that the evidence of the accused being the subject of the ADVO is relevant to put in context and provide a potential explanation for a number of communications made by the accused after the Crown says he killed the deceased.  There are references in the communications to which I was referred to the accused speaking about the deceased having tried to call the police.  The contention, as I understand it, is that the jury might better understand such references if they were aware that the accused was apparently in breach of the ADVO.
4Having reviewed the various communications to which I have been referred, it seems to me that the need to explain why it was that the deceased may have been minded to contact the police adds very little to the prosecution case; that is to say the probative value is limited.  The fact that seems to be more important is that the accused was saying that the deceased was endeavouring to call the police and he responded in the way that he describes in these communications.
5There is potential for unfair prejudice in that, if the jury were aware that the accused was the subject of an ADVO, they may engage in some form of propensity reasoning or speculate about what conduct the accused had engaged in that brought about the making of the order.  Of course, directions to the jury not to engage in such reasoning or speculation could be given but there would remain the possibility that the evidence would simply serve as a distraction, unnecessarily so given its limited legitimate value.  In my view the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice and so it is excluded.

2761311,R v Ray (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 586,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Just after the court resumed after the luncheon adjournment today I ruled that certain evidence, to which objection was taken, was admissible.  These were my reasons.
2The Crown alleges that the accused fatally assaulted the deceased, Ms Priscilla Perry, in the late afternoon of Saturday 9 April 2011 in a unit at The Entrance.  The deceased had been living at this unit with Ms Shantell Dargan for about six weeks.  Ms Dargan had been the girlfriend of the accused until he violently assaulted her in 2010 and went to gaol.  An apprehended domestic violence order was made which, amongst other things, required the accused to stay away from Ms Dargan.  Notwithstanding that order, the accused frequented the unit at The Entrance regularly.  It would seem that he and Ms Dargan had resumed their somewhat turbulent relationship.  It would seem as well that there was a turbulent relationship with the deceased as well.  There had apparently been some physical fighting involving Ms Dargan and the deceased the evening prior to 9 April 2011.
3I note that the Crown does not intend to lead evidence of the prior assault upon Ms Dargan by the accused or the fact that he went to gaol.  Earlier today I excluded evidence that the accused was the subject of the apprehended domestic violence order, it having minimal probative value which was outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.
4Dr Webb objected to evidence the Crown proposed to lead from Ms Dargan of events which occurred on the morning of 9 April 2011.  They involved the accused assaulting Ms Dargan which prompted her to flee from the unit.
5According to Ms Dargan she and the accused fought on the morning of 9 April 2011.  Their fight concerned arguments and fighting which had occurred the previous evening.  A friend of Ms Dargan and the deceased, Ms Katie Wills, had stayed over.  Ms Wills, according to Ms Dargan, intervened during an argument between the accused and Ms Dargan during the course of which the accused had spat on and hit Ms Dargan to the back of the head.  The accused told Ms Wills to ""stay out of it"" and the accused made a threatening gesture towards Ms Wills.
6Ms Dargan continues in her statement, 
""I could tell he was angry.  If I was to stay he would have gotten stuck into me, so I was out of there"".
7She then describes how she fled the unit and the accused chased after her, pleading with her to return.  She says that he said, amongst other things,
""If you don't come back I'm gonna smash the friggin' house up.  I'll flog Priscilla too"".
8Ms Dargan managed to get away from him and he returned to the unit.
9I was informed that Ms Dargan left the unit at about 10.15am on the morning of Saturday 9 April.  It will be alleged by the Crown that the fatal assault occurred at about 4.30pm.
10Ms Dargan was in contact with the accused by telephone during the ensuing hours.  She said that in the course of these communications he said things such as:
""I'll fucking smash the house up.  Priscilla's going in the boot.  I'm gonna flog Priscilla too"".
11He also said:
""Priscilla is arguing.  I am wigging out.  I am gonna drive Priscilla's car over"".
12In the late afternoon there was another telephone conversation in which Ms Dargan says she could hear the deceased in the background.  Ms Dargan asked the accused:
""What's fucking going on?  Is she all right?""
13The accused replied:
""You'd better get here, I'm gonna wig out.  Priscilla is carrying on.  I can't handle her"".
14I was also informed that there was to be evidence of a subsequent telephone conversation in a call by the accused, who was then in custody, to Ms Dargan in which he spoke of a ""big build up of things"", which culminated in the fatal assault upon the deceased.
15The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the evidence of the events transpiring between the accused and Ms Dargan on the morning of 9 April was relevant in that it provided a context or background to the events which occurred between the accused and the deceased later that day.  
16Dr Webb says that whatever probative value the evidence had, it was outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.  He said there was no issue about the accused engaging in certain aspects of the alleged assault upon the deceased, particularly kicking her.  The danger of unfair prejudice was said to arise from a risk that the jury may reason that the accused had been aggressive towards Ms Dargan earlier in the day and had simply transferred that aggression later in the day onto the deceased.
17I am not sure that such reasoning would be unfairly prejudicial to the accused; but in any event it seems to me that the events concerning the accused and Ms Dargan earlier in the day on 9 April 2011 do provide a context for subsequent events, particularly statements made by the accused, such that those subsequent events and statements can be properly understood.
18The evidence has more than the minimal level of probative value contended for on behalf of the accused.  I am not persuaded that there is a greater level of unfair prejudice.  Whether there will be any unfair prejudice at all may be assessed in the light of all of the evidence, but it seems to me that any such danger that may be apparent can be suitably addressed by directions.  Those were my reasons for holding that the evidence was admissible.

2761319,Health Care Complaints Commission v Rahman [2013] NSWMT 6,"EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT

1DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: The proceedings before the Tribunal are brought by the Health Care Complaints Commission (""the HCCC""). The HCCC seeks resolution of four complaints. 

2The respondent has consented to the Tribunal dealing with both the establishment of the complaints and, if proved, the imposition of protective orders. 

3The Tribunal is acutely aware of the seriousness of the allegations put by the HCCC and the long-reaching effect of the orders open to it. Accordingly it has approached the evidence on the basis of the standard of proof in Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336. 

Some background

4The respondent was born in 1967 in Bangladesh. He graduated with the degree of MB.BS from Chittagong Medical College in Bangladesh in 1992. He then worked in various capacities within the medical profession in Bangladesh. In June of 1994 he began work in a government hospital in Zambia for about six months. He worked from March to December 1999 in a regional hospital in Natal in South Africa. 

5In January of 1996 the respondent commenced work as a general practitioner in Durban in South Africa and he remained in this capacity for about four years. 

6The respondent was first registered in Australia with the Queensland Medical Board in 2001. He became registered in New South Wales in May 2009. In the same year he became a member of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. 

7In August 2009 the respondent commenced working as a general practitioner at the Dapto Medical Centre. He remained at the centre until he was charged with the criminal offences that are the subject of the complaints. 

8On 13 March 2010 the respondent was charged with two offences under s61M of the Crimes Act 1900. The charges concerned the aggravated sexual assault of two female patients. As a result of these charges a s66 hearing was held by the Medical Board on 15 April 2010. At this stage the respondent had not been found guilty of any of the offences and, as was his entitlement, he refused to answer any questions about the allegations. 

9The original two charges were significantly expanded to include allegations concerning seventeen female patients. On 6 April 2011 the respondent pleaded guilty to twenty-two counts of indecent assault under s61L of the Crimes Act and one allegation of aggravated indecent assault under s61M. The respondent was convicted of the offences and committed for sentence to the District Court of New South Wales. The respondent's registration was suspended on 12 May 2011. 

10The respondent appeared for sentence on 28 July 2011 when, in addition to the charges of which he had been convicted, a further three allegations were admitted by the respondent and dealt with under s33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

11The hearing in the District Court was before Judge Cogswell SC. The cumulative result of all of the sentences imposed by his Honour was a term of imprisonment of nine years with a non-parole period of six years. The term of imprisonment commenced on 22 July 2011. Judge Cogswell's reasons for sentence are in Exhibit C. 

12As at the date of this Tribunal's hearing the respondent remains in prison and has appeared pursuant to orders made by the Chairperson of the Medical Tribunal on 6 December 2012. 

13The respondent, before the Tribunal, admitted the complaints. This followed an explanation of the complaints to him by both the Tribunal and by counsel for the HCCC. The Tribunal is grateful to counsel for her assistance in ensuring the respondent understood the proceedings. 

The complaints 

14Complaint 1 is an assertion that the respondent has been convicted of a number of criminal offences. The particulars outline the twenty-three offences to which the respondent pleaded guilty on 28 July 2011. 

15Complaint 2 asserts that the respondent is guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct under s139B of the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (NSW) (""the National Law"") relying on the offences set out in Complaint 1 together with the further offences taken into account on sentencing. 

16Complaint 3 asserts that the respondent is guilty of professional misconduct under s139E of the National Law, relying on all of the offences set out in Complaint 2. 

17Complaint 4 alleges that practitioner ""is not a suitable person to hold registration in the practitioner's profession"", again based on the admitted offences. 

18Annexure A to the Notice of Complaint is a Statement of Agreed Facts relied upon by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the criminal proceedings against the respondent. The statement has been signed by the respondent and is to be taken as indicating his admission of the facts alleged therein. 

19All of the seventeen victims are female. They were all patients of the Dapto Medical Centre. Their ages range from fourteen to thirty-seven. While most could be described as young women there were two, respectively aged fourteen and sixteen, who might be described as children. They were certainly no more than teenagers, as were three other victims, respectively aged seventeen, eighteen and nineteen. 

20It is not necessary to recount the details of the offences. They are apparent in the agreed facts. Suffice to say that they involve the interference with the breasts and genitalia of the patients, usually under the most spurious excuses for the need for examination. The agreed facts also contain an acknowledgement by the respondent of the absence of any need for his actions in the proper treatment of the patients. 

21The conduct can only be described as extremely serious and the effect on the victims as likely to be traumatic. This is emphasised in the various victim statements that can be found in the HCCC's tendered material. 

22The respondent's admissions render the facts alleged in the complaints easily proven. They also, without more, almost automatically bespeak both unsatisfactory professional conduct (Complaint 2) and professional misconduct (Complaint 3). If any more need be said in relation to the establishment of the allegations concerning Complaints 2 and 3 it is that the offences committed by the respondent all display the highest degree of disregard for the care and welfare of the patients. 

23The facts disclose the most fundamental interference with the rights of all of the women involved. They involve taking advantage of patients as young as fourteen and the absolute breach of trust that the medical profession relies upon in the competent and ethical treatment of patients. 

24The Tribunal is satisfied that all of the allegations in the complaints have been established to the necessary standard. As stated above, the respondent admitted the complaints.

Protective orders

25The Tribunal accepts that its role is not to punish. This was the task of Judge Cogswell in the District Court. The Tribunal's task is to make protective orders, protective of both the public and the medical profession. The following statement of Viscount Simon LC in General Medical Council v Spackman [1943] AC 627 is an appropriate starting point: 

""The high reputation of the medical profession as a whole depends in no small measure on excluding from it those whose professional misconduct makes them unworthy to belong to it, and the confidence which the public are accustomed to put in the family doctor is intimately connected with the assurance that those who practise the art of medicine are, in all relations with their patients, individuals of the highest honour"". 

26The conduct was over a prolonged a period (11 September 2009 to 12 March 2010) during which the respondent must have known that his actions were both medically and ethically wrong as well unlawful. 

27Often more than one assault was committed on the same patient with the patient sometimes being induced to return on a false premise, such as the need for an unnecessary follow-up breast examination. 

28Some of the patients were already vulnerable at the time of the assaults, for example Patients C, E and H. 

29Other patients were subjected to acts of physical violence. These included Patients I and J. In respect of Patient I it is also noted that the first examination took place in the presence of the patient's foster children.

30The continuing pattern of offending behaviour precludes any suggestion of an error being followed by remorse and insight. Had the respondent not been reported to the police his conduct may well have continued. 

31The respondent provided four references (Exhibit 1). They all give him considerable support both as to his character and where relevant to his competence as a doctor. None of them, however, deals specifically with the offences involved. They all refer to a period prior to the commission of the offences. Although the respondent said they were aware of the offences, the Tribunal does not find the references particularly useful in deciding protective orders. 

32The respondent gave oral evidence and was cross-examined. He described his background in the medical profession and his work in Queensland. He said that he came to the city because he wanted to ensure a better education for his three children. He described his involvement in the offences as more of a demonstration of his intent to reach a good rapport with the patients than an assault upon them. Nevertheless he said, and often repeated, that he had signed the Agreed Statement of Facts and ""took responsibility"". 

33The Tribunal was unimpressed with the respondent's assertions of a lack of improper intent and found the respondent to be avoiding the serious nature of the offences to which he had pleaded guilty and of which he accepted the factual content. 

34There was a clear lack of insight on the respondent's part. At one stage he even denied that he was a sexual offender. He shows little insight into the extreme departure from medical standards of his so called 'examinations', much less their criminal nature. 

35The respondent asked the Tribunal to allow him to practise upon his release from prison. The Tribunal thinks this suggestion is both impractical and, in any event, entirely contrary to the protection of the public. It is impractical because the respondent would not have the necessary skills to rejoin the medical profession after so many years away from it without the opportunity to maintain his skills. 

36The Tribunal is far from satisfied that there has been any indication of a reformation of the defects of character that were evident in the offences. 

37The respondent's suggestion is contrary to the public interest, because the respondent's apparent lack of insight into his wrongdoing coupled with his rejection today of matters clearly accepted by him (in the agreed facts) indicates a clear risk of re-offending. 

38Nothing placed before the Tribunal would give it any confidence that the respondent is able to return to practise even under the sternest conditions. 

39The Tribunal is firmly of the view that the only option open to it, to ensure the protection of the public and of the medical profession, is that the respondent be deregistered. His conduct was so serious that cancellation of his registration is an inevitable result. 

40Section 149C(7) of the National Law provides that ""an order may also provide that an application for review of the order under Division 8 may not be made until after a specified time"". The respondent still has some four years of his sentence to run. Before applying for a review the respondent will need to take steps to refresh his medical knowledge and take part in at least an ethics course. The Tribunal is of the view that the respondent should not be able to apply for re-registration for eight years from today. 

41There was some confusion about the respondent's current registration status; was he suspended or already deregistered. The Tribunal's orders reflect both possibilities. 

42The respondent said that he could see no reason why he should pay the costs of these proceedings. The proceedings are a result of his actions and it must follow that he pay the costs. 

43The Tribunal makes the following orders:

(a)A direction that the respondent's registration be cancelled;

(b)Alternatively, if appropriate, a direction that subject to Order C below the respondent be disqualified from applying for re-registration;

(c)The respondent may not make an application for review of his registration for a period of eight years from the date of these orders;

(d)The respondent is to pay the costs of these proceedings;

(e)The appropriate review body is the Medical Tribunal of New South Wales.

		26 April 2013",2013-04-21 00:00:00,NSW Medical Tribunal
2761323,KW v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 84,"Judgment

1On 19 February 2013 judgment was delivered in this Court in respect of an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed on the applicant in the District Court on 9 March 2011 in respect of five separate offences: KW v R [2013] NSWCCA 31. The relevant facts are there fully set out. Leave to appeal was granted, the appeal allowed and the applicant re-sentenced. The aggregate sentence then imposed was of a head sentence of 6 years and 6 months commencing on 7 April 2010 with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months which would expire on 6 July 2015.

2The Crown has drawn attention to a discrepancy in the judgment and the orders. At [43] the Court indicated its intention of giving the applicant the benefit of a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 44(2) provides:

""The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).""

3A finding of special circumstances under the sub-section would have the effect of reducing, to below 75 per cent, the ratio that the non-parole period bears to the head sentence. Where sentencing in respect of multiple offences, this is sometimes done in respect of individual sentences in order to restore the statutory ratio to the overall result (the aggregate sentence). In other cases a finding of special circumstances is intended to have the effect of varying that ratio in respect of the aggregate sentence only. 

4In this case, it was made plain that the intention was that the finding of special circumstances would be implemented in order to affect the aggregate non-parole period, rather than the non-parole periods imposed in respect of the individual offences.

5The Crown has pointed out that the aggregate sentence imposed does not give effect to the Court's stated intention. The non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months (63 months) is 81 per cent of the head sentence of 6 years and 6 months (78 months).

6An overall non-parole period in the statutory proportions in respect of a sentence of 6 years and 6 months would be 4 years and 10½ months (58.5 months).

7Pursuant to Rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules the Court has power to set aside or vary an order in appropriate circumstances. Those circumstances have here been demonstrated to exist.

8In my opinion it is appropriate to vary the order previously made and to re-structure the sentences to achieve an aggregate non-parole period of 4 years and 5 months (53 months). It is neither necessary nor appropriate to vary either the aggregate head sentence, or the head sentences in respect of the individual offences. The object can be achieved by reducing the non-parole periods in respect of the sentences that are not subject to fixed terms, and to vary the accumulation that previously applied. 

9Accordingly, I propose the following orders:

(i) Order 3 made on 19 February 2013 set aside.

(ii) In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced as follows:

Count (v): imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months, commencing on 7 April 2010 and expiring on 6 January 2014, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, expiring on 6 October 2012;

Counts (ii)-(iv): imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year and 6 months, commencing on 7 October 2010 and expiring on 6 April 2012;

Count (i): imprisonment for 5 years and 6 months, commencing on 7 April 2011 and expiring on 6 October 2016, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 5 months, expiring on 6 September 2014.

The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for parole is 6 September 2014.

10HARRISON J: I agree with Simpson J.

2761327,R v Wright [2013] NSWCCA 82,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Price J.

2PRICE J: The applicant, Grant David Wright, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Robison DCJ in the District Court at Grafton on 24 May 2012. He had pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated dangerous driving causing the death of CAM contrary to s 52A(2) Crimes Act 1900 (count one) and one count of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm to MBJ contrary to s 52A(4) Crimes Act (count two).

3The matters of aggravation averred to in each charge were driving the vehicle by more than 45 kph over the speed limit and driving the vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor, having in his blood a prescribed concentration of alcohol of not less than 0.157 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.

4An offence contrary to s 52A(2) Crimes Act is punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment, whereas the maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 52A(4) is 11 years imprisonment. 

5The applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 24 May 2012 and expiring on 23 May 2015 for count two. A sentence of 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years 3 months commencing on 24 November 2012 and expiring on 23 February 2018 and a balance of term of 3 years 9 months expiring on 23 November 2021 was imposed for count one.

6The overall sentence, then was imprisonment for 9 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years 9 months. 

7The earliest date that the applicant is eligible to be released to parole is 23 February 2018. The applicant was disqualified from driving for five years. 

8The judge had reduced the sentence by 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty.

9The Notice of Appeal identifies two grounds, namely:

1. That the learned sentencing judge impermissibly confined the issue of the applicant's mental illness to the issue of moral culpability. 

2. That the sentence is manifestly excessive. 

10An agreed statement of facts consisting of five pages was tendered in the sentencing proceedings. I shall set out the facts as succinctly as possible. 

11At around 5.30am on 5 January 2011, the applicant set out on a journey from his home, north along the Pacific Highway near Tyndale in Northern New South Wales. There were two passengers in the vehicle, a 14 year old girl (MBJ) and a 16 year old boy (CAM). MBJ had been living with the applicant and his family off and on for four months prior to the offence. She was seated in the rear passenger side seat of the vehicle. CAM was the boyfriend of MBJ and was sitting in the front passenger seat. 

12Prior to the collision, the applicant drove dangerously at high speeds along the Pacific Highway which attracted the attention of other motorists. One motorist observed the applicant's vehicle overtake his van at high speed over an unbroken centre line and on approach to a blind left hand bend. Another motorist saw the applicant's vehicle pass his B-Double Combination at well in excess of the 100 kph speed limit, noting that as the applicant's vehicle went passed him, the applicant had his arm extended out of the driver's side window giving him a two fingered peace sign and his vehicle was drifting onto the wrong side of the road. These motorists were so concerned with the manner of the applicant's driving that they phoned the police. 

13Another motorist estimated that as the applicant's vehicle passed him, it was travelling at a speed of at least 200 kph. After the applicant's vehicle had passed, the motorist saw the rear of the vehicle ""wriggling"" around as it negotiated a sweeping right hand bend and drifted left over the fog line narrowly avoiding running off the edge of the highway. 

14Other motorists who were travelling south saw the applicant's vehicle approaching in the opposite direction at high speed. One motorist whose vehicle was negotiating a sweeping right hand bend saw the applicant's vehicle travelling at high speed, leaning very heavily to the right and drifting towards his vehicle and trailer as it came around the corner towards him. Another motorist noted that as the applicant's vehicle negotiated a left hand bend at high speed, that the back right hand side was squatted down and appeared to be floating as it came round the bend. On seeing the high speed at which the applicant's vehicle was travelling, another motorist formed the opinion that the vehicle must have been an unmarked police vehicle in pursuit. 

15At some stage, the applicant pulled over to the left hand side of the highway and informed his passengers that he did not have enough petrol to get to the destination and that he had forgotten his wallet. The applicant then did a U-turn and travelled south along the highway at a speed which was estimated to be close to 200 kph. 

16The applicant's vehicle was seen by another motorist to lose control on a sweeping left hand bend, veering first onto the wrong side of the road, then skidding side ways out of control, crashing through a stand of trees. 

17Gavin Lennon, a physicist specialising in ""collision reconstruction"", was of the opinion that the applicant's vehicle prior to skidding sideways was being driven at a speed between 163 kph and 197 kph. 

18A blood test revealed that the applicant had a blood alcohol level of not less than 0.135 grams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. Dr Judith Perl, a pharmacologist, was of the opinion that the applicant's blood alcohol concentration would have been not less than 0.157 g/100 ml with an upper limit of 0.189 g/100 ml and a most likely level of 0.167 g/100 ml at the time of the collision. Dr Perl opined that at a blood alcohol concentration of 0.157 g/100 ml and above, all people would be under the influence of alcohol to the extent that driving ability would be very substantially impaired. 

19CAM died due to massive head injuries. MBJ sustained multiple leg and pelvic fractures. After being cut from the wreckage, she was flown to Lismore Base Hospital where she underwent a number of surgeries to insert a number of metal plates and splints into her body to stabilise her fractures. The applicant also sustained a number of injuries and was admitted to Lismore Base Hospital. 

20The total distance travelled by the applicant from his home to the site of the collision was 38½ kilometres. The applicable speed limit was 100 kph. 

21The judge found that the applicant's driving ability would have been very substantially impaired as a result of his level of intoxication. His Honour observed (ROS 10): 

""So this was an extraordinary course of driving, two young passengers who were entitled to expect that they would be kept safe within that vehicle, a vehicle being driven by a person who clearly had no regard for their safety and exposed them and others to a significant degree of risk and harm.""

22When referring to the victim impact statements that had been read to the court, the judge had no doubt that ""what [had] occurred [had] left a devastating impact on each of the victims"" (ROS 10). MBJ's victim impact statement disclosed that she had spent almost two months in hospital and had two broken femurs, a broken ankle, three broken ribs, a fractured tail bone and had nine hours of surgery and was given three blood transfusions. She described herself as being ""mentally damaged"" and having a ""very hard time coping with life."" MBJ was on anti-depressants and anxiety medication for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and had thought about committing suicide many times. 

23Dr Graham Truswell's expert certificate that detailed MBJ's admission to Lismore Base Hospital, her injuries and operative treatment was in evidence before the judge. 

24CAM's mother described the irreversible impact that the loss of CAM's life had had upon her family. She observed that (AB145): 

""To entrust your child in the care of an adult that presents as responsible and trustworthy, and to have that trust broken, is the worst of all deceptions."" 

25The applicant sustained extensive injuries in the accident which included a broken shoulder and scapula, broken collarbone, six broken ribs, two fractured vertebrae and a broken pelvis. Both lungs were punctured, as was his spleen. 

26The judge found that the offences involved a ""high level of moral culpability"" (ROS 15). 

27The applicant was born on 28 May 1967. He was 43 years old when the offences were committed. His record as a driver in New South Wales and Queensland reveals an appalling traffic history between 1984 and 1997. He had four convictions for driving with the high range concentration of alcohol, the last conviction being on 23 May 1997 when he was sentenced to serve 9 months imprisonment by way of periodic detention and disqualified from driving for 5 years. His driving history prior to 1997 includes convictions for driving whilst disqualified (four times) driving after license cancelled, driving under the influence and driving whilst suspended. It appears that since he was re-issued with an unrestricted license in August 2002, he exceeded the speed limit in July 2007 by not more than 15 kph and in April 2010 by more than 20 kph, but not more than 30 kph. These offences were dealt with by traffic infringement notices and the loss of demerit points. 

28In referring to the applicant's traffic history, his Honour said that it spoke for itself, but noted (ROS 16) ""the gap in the record from the time of the last offending to the date of the commission of these offences."" 

29The applicant gave evidence during the proceedings on sentence. He told the judge that he suffered a bad head injury in the accident and did not even remember his mother visiting him in hospital. He did not know why he drove. He extended his apologies to the relatives of the victims. He said that he had a ""pretty horrific childhood"" but that was no excuse. He had been on Seroquel for almost five years, which had been prescribed by a psychiatrist at Grafton and Maclean and was still on that medication. The applicant said that even with that medication, he had nightmares and could not sleep. He described his work history that had included his own garden care business that he ran for about four years and the running of a restaurant at a golf club that had finished about four months before the collision. 

30The judge noted that the applicant had described as ""shocking"" what had occurred and did not know why he had driven. His Honour accepted that the applicant's apology was genuine and that his evidence overall was a ""true expression of genuine remorse and contrition and empathy for the victims"" (ROS 13). His Honour observed that the applicant was happily married, that his wife was very supportive of him and that he had a genuine love and affection for his children, aged 17 and 15. The judge noted the applicant's evidence that he was placed on medication some four or five years ago and the applicant's admission that his ""pretty horrific childhood"" was not an excuse. His Honour said that the applicant's admission went to his credibility as he did not blame his background on what had occurred. 

31When referring to the applicant's employment history, his Honour remarked (ROS at 12):

""...I note his evidence about jobs in his life, that he has held numerous jobs, apparently he was last employed at a restaurant, and from what he has told me, it seems that at least in so far as the restaurant employment was concerned, he had a managerial type position. I note he had that position no doubt with whatever degree of mental disability he may have had but he was still able to hold that position and other positions in his working life it would appear to me."" 

32A report from Dr Christopher Lennings, a psychologist, was before the judge. Dr Lennings detailed the applicant's background which included being born to a 16 year old mother who had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and had been at times abusive and aggressive towards him. The applicant had been to over twenty schools and had six stepfathers, five of whom beat him and one of whom put a shotgun to his head. The applicant completed Year 10 and since school had been in paid employment. He began drinking alcohol around the age of 17, had probably drunk a lot and was currently consuming about 70 standard drinks per week. 

33The psychologist reported (AB 151): 

""...alcohol has been a significant component of his emotional regulation and a habit he is likely to find hard to break. He is likely to require detoxification if he is incarcerated."" 

34 Dr Lennings conducted a psychological assessment by asking the applicant to complete the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). Dr Lennings expressed the opinion at paragraph 42 (AB 155): 

""The most likely diagnoses for [the applicant] on the PAI include Major Depression, alcohol dependence and posttraumatic stress disorder. On the basis of my interview each of these diagnosis [sic] is likely to be confirmed."" 

35At paragraph 43, Dr Lennings referred to the applicant as ""a man with an exceptionally unfortunate history."" Dr Lennings wrote (AB 155): 

""He experienced multiple child protection risks as a child. His family appears to have a high genetic predisposition to mental illness and given the vicissitudes of his life it is to his credit and resilience he has carved the essentially pro social life he has. He has developed problematic behaviours and presents as a person who is typically depressed, and has used alcohol unwisely at various times in his life as a form of self medication...""

and;

""Nonetheless, on his report in spite of a most problematic family of origin and limited social support he has done better than might otherwise been expected. His greatest risk of problems seems to have been his heavy regular drinking and whilst the individual days do not now result in severe inebriation the aggregate of his alcohol use is high and most concerning. It is alcohol that led, it seems to the current offence, although as he has no memory of what took place it is hard to reconstruct the events of the day..."" 

36Dr Lennings reported at paragraph 47 that the applicant ""will experience a need for detoxification when he is incarcerated and this should be highlighted to prison authorities"" (AB 156). He assessed the applicant's rehabilitative potential to be ""moderate, but likely to be eroded by a long prison sentence"" (AB 156). 

37The judge referred in some detail to Dr Lennings' report and specifically to paragraphs 43 and 47. His Honour remarked that ""drinking is an ongoing problem for [the applicant] and should be addressed in the rehabilitation process"": (ROS 14). It was his Honour's ""firm recommendation"" that the [prison] authorities take on board the applicant's possible need for detoxification. His Honour considered that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation would be greatly enhanced if he was to be released following a shorter non-parole period than would otherwise be the case and made a finding of ""special circumstances"". 

38Following a consideration of the questions of cumulation or concurrence and totality, by his Honour, who cited Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57, the sentence for count one was partially accumulated on the sentence for count two by six months. 

39Ground 1: That the learned sentencing judge impermissibly confined the issue of the applicant's mental illness to the issue of moral culpability. 

40The applicant submitted that he had suffered from a mental disability both before and after the collision. He referred to Dr Lenning's opinion that he suffered from major depression, alcohol dependence and post traumatic stress disorder and that he had been prescribed Seroquel for five years prior to the collision. Specific reference was made to Dr Lenning's observations at paragraph 46 of his report (AB 156): 

""...a lengthy custodial sentence is likely to have severe consequences for [the applicant]. He is a psychologically fragile man and will be subject to significant bullying and anti social pressures in gaol. He has largely managed to forsake a life of ""madness and badness"" that the rest of his family of origin appear unable to have escaped, but gaol represents a potent risk factor to unhinge him. To that end I have significant concerns about his ability to weather a lengthy period of incarceration."" 

41The applicant drew the Court's attention to the following passage of his Honour's sentencing remarks (at ROS 16-17):

""As far as the assertion that he has a mental disability, I ask myself did it contribute to the commission of these offences in a material way? I have been taken to what appears in the notes at p 96065 of the Butterworths Criminal Practice and Procedure Book, Vol 1. I am not of the view that any mental disability had contributed in a material way, he made the decision firstly to drink, secondly to drive and thirdly to drive in the way he did, he must have known at all material times that he was driving at a very excessive speed indeed and of course he knew he had two young passengers. General deterrence in my view, is a fair legitimate and necessary factor to take into account. The courts, must send a strong message to the community that offences of this nature will not be treated leniently. They must be treated appropriately and fairly. So I am therefore satisfied he had knowledge of what he was actually doing, particularly having regard to that time when he decided to stop and turn around..."" 

42The applicant pointed out that mental illness may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh heavily on a prisoner or it may be a very important factor in considering rehabilitation. The absence of a causal connection between the offence and the mental illness, the applicant submitted, does not produce the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence by virtue of mental illness. The applicant argued that his serious mental illness demanded a softening of the importance of general deterrence and a reduction in penalty. 

43It is well recognised that an offender's mental condition is not only relevant to a person's moral culpability but can have the effect of reducing the weight given to matters such as general deterrence, retribution and denunciation: Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39 at [53]. However, the High Court made it clear at [54] that such a reduction will not occur in every case. 

44The judge in his sentencing remarks did not confine his consideration of the applicant's mental illness to the question of moral culpability but took it into account when considering general deterrence. 

45The judge determined that the mental illness had not contributed in a material way to the commission of the offences and went on to say (ROS 17): ""General deterrence in my view, is a fair legitimate and necessary factor to take into account"". Unsurprisingly, his Honour's finding as to causation is not challenged on appeal as there was not much material before the judge as to the applicant's mental health before the accident and Dr Lennings opined in the passage quoted at [34] above that it was alcohol that led to the offending. 

46However, it does not necessarily follow that because of a lack of a causal connection between the mental illness and the commission of an offence, the mental illness has no relevance to general deterrence. As Allen J (with whom Sully J agreed) explained in Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 72: 

""There is, however, one matter I would add for myself. It relates to the relevance to general deterrence of a mental disorder where the mental disorder did not play a causative role in the commission of the offence. The Chief Justice has indicated that even in that circumstance the existence of the mental disorder can be relevant to general deterrence. The cases to which the Chief Justice has referred are all cases dealing with mental disorder of some sort, whether it be deficiency in intellect or some psychiatric disorder. However, the general principles of sentencing in relation to taking into account general deterrence are no different, in respect of mental disorder, than they are in respect of any other characteristic of an offender which might make it inappropriate that he receive a full measure of punishment which reflects the need for general deterrence.

General deterrence is simply the deterrence, of others and characteristics personal to an offender might make him an unpersuasive vehicle for the deterrence of others in the sight of those others. It must be emphasised that general deterrence is directed to deterring others. So one must look to the impact upon others. Even in a case where an offender has a mental disability which is unrelated to the commission of the crime the sympathy which his condition must attract in the eyes of others in the community generally may be such that to sentence him with full weight given to general deterrence might have no impact at all upon others. Human sympathy would say: ""Well, you would not expect him to get the same sentence as someone else.""
In that respect there is no difference at all between mental disability and other personal characteristics or personal conditions which would attract sympathy. Assume, for example, that an offender is perfectly able mentally in all respects but, after the commission of the offence, he has become a quadriplegic as a result of a car accident, or he has contracted some dreadful disease which is in the process of shortening his life. In those circumstances, the same considerations of how members of the community would perceive the sentence would apply as in the case of mental disorder.""


47The present case is not one, in my view, where the applicant's mental illness calls for lesser emphasis to be placed on the need for general deterrence. I do not think that the applicant's depressive illness and post traumatic stress disorder would in all the circumstances attract the sympathy of others so as to render him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. 

48Although there may be no causative link between the mental illness and the commission of the offences, the mental illness may have a significant part to play in the question of rehabilitation: Engert at 71. The judge emphasised the applicant's need for rehabilitation and made a finding of special circumstances. 

49During the proceedings on sentence, the applicant's counsel made a brief reference to the applicant's custody being more onerous for him because of his mental illness. His Honour was also referred to a page in Butterworths Criminal Practice and Procedure, Vol 1, that contained the principles relevant to mental illness and the sentencing of offenders that had been summarised in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] 79 NSWLR 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194 by McClellan CJ at CL which included at [177]:

""It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced."" (case citations omitted) 

50The judge made no reference to this consideration in his sentencing remarks and it appears that he may have overlooked it. 

51The Crown submitted that notwithstanding this oversight, there was no evidence as to how any mental abnormality the applicant was suffering from, would mean that he would suffer in prison any more than someone without a mental abnormality. On the other hand, the applicant relied upon Dr Lenning's opinion in the passage quoted at [39] above that the applicant ""... is a psychologically fragile man and will be subject to significant bullying and antisocial pressures in gaol.""

52Matters to be taken into account in favour of an offender are to be established on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270; [1999] HCA 54.

53There was no evidence before the judge that the applicant would be unable to obtain treatment in prison for his depression and post traumatic stress disorder, nor was there any evidence that his mental illness would place him in protective or segregated custody. Dr Lennings did, however, suggest that a review by psychological services should occur in custody and the applicant's medication may need adjusting. Furthermore, there was no evidence to support the psychologist's opinion that the applicant, who was almost 44 years old when sentenced, would be subjected to significant bullying and antisocial pressures. At its highest, it amounts to no more than informed speculation. 

54For my part, I am not persuaded that the applicant's imprisonment will be more onerous for him because of his mental illness. 

55I would reject Ground 1 of the appeal. 

56Ground 2: That the sentence is manifestly excessive.

57The applicant's contention that the sentence is manifestly excessive focussed upon the sentence of aggravated driving causing death (count one). There is no complaint about the sentence for count two. 

58The principal thrust of the applicant's argument was that the notional starting point of the sentence for count one was 12 years imprisonment before allowance was made for the utilitarian discount of 25 per cent for the plea, which is two years less than the maximum penalty of 14 years. The applicant submitted that the judge did not make a finding of worst case, or close to, a worst case scenario and there were a number of subjective mitigating features that should have been brought into account. They were: 

(a) the serious injuries suffered by the applicant in the collision and the disabilities that he continues to experience;

(b) the applicant's ""extra-curial"" suffering; and

(c) his mental illness. 

59Other than the issue of mental illness which was the subject of the first ground of appeal, the applicant's contention of the judge's lack of attention to these subjective features is raised not as discrete error but as reflecting upon the manifest excess of the sentence for count one. 

60It has long been the practice of courts to take into account the physical condition of an offender. The fact that serious injuries arise as a consequence of a motor vehicle collision, for which the offender is responsible does not alter the approach that is to be taken. Serious injuries may be taken into account: Rosenthal v R [2008] NSWCCA 149; as may any serious continuing disabilities, that may make imprisonment more burdensome for the offender. The principles stated in R v Vachalec [1981] 1 NSWLR 351 at 353 apply to this consideration. 

61As to the notion of ""extra-curial suffering"", the effect of the death of another person in the accident on the offender and self punishment (the self inflicted sense of shame and guilt) are relevant factors to be taken into account, but the weight to be given to those factors depends on all the circumstances. As Smart AJ emphasised in R v Koosmen [2004] NSWCCA 359 at [32]: 

""...Where the facts reveal gross moral culpability judges should be wary of attaching too much weight to considerations of self punishment. Genuine remorse and self punishment do not compensate for or balance out gross moral culpability."" 

62An offender's close relationship with the deceased, as a matter of common sense, might provide some indication of the depth of the self punishment but that does not mean that this consideration does not extend to an offender to whom the deceased was a stranger. Grove J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed) in Hughes v R (2008) 185 A Crim R 155; [2008] NSWCCA 48 observed at [23] that ""leniency does not derive from the mere fact that the deceased was not a stranger: R v Howcher (2004) 146 A Crim R 371; [2004] NSWCCA 179, but from the consequential quality and depth of the remorse and shock."" 

63Each case will depend on its own circumstances and the weight to be given by a sentencing judge to these factors calls for the making of a discretionary decision. 

64The applicant was seriously injured in the accident. His injuries are described at [24] above. Dr Lennings interviewed the applicant on 1 March 2012. Dr Lennings reported at paragraph 28 that the applicant was placed on heavy-duty painkillers (such as Oxycontin) and reported severe pain for several months. The applicant told Dr Lennings that he had to go ""cold turkey"" off the Oxycontin and was placed on alternate pain control, but remained on significant analgesia as he had severe pain, including sciatica. The applicant said that he continued to have severe nightmares that began following the accident, and reported his ""life as hell"", and ""a dominant feeling of being scared by all that had happened"". 

65When the applicant gave evidence before the judge, he did not mention that he was in pain or taking analgesia for pain relief. He did tell the judge about his regular use of Seroquel and continuing nightmares. No submission was made to the judge that the applicant had (other than a mental illness) continuing disabilities resulting from the collision that should be taken into account. 

66It is plain that the judge took into account all of the material before him as to the applicant's injuries and disabilities. He accepted Dr Lenning's description of the applicant's injuries and said (ROS 12):

""As far as the injuries themselves are concerned it appears that he has had some degree of recovery, he refers to a sore back but no major medical issues until the severe injuries that he incurred in the accident. In any event there is a physical problem in so far as the accident is concerned and I take that into account to some extent."" 

67The applicant told Dr Lennings that CAM was ""the best friend"" of his son, that his son and daughter had put CAM's picture on a wall at home and he cried every time he looked at it. During his evidence, the applicant told the judge that ""it used to kill [him]"" every time he saw the picture. 

68Although the applicant's counsel did not make a submission that the applicant had suffered ""extra-curial"" punishment, his Honour remarked upon the applicant's extreme distress in the witness box, that his apology was genuine and that the applicant had (ROS at 13): 

""...effectively, sentenced himself to life, bearing in mind what has occurred but this court must set an appropriate sentence having regard to the objective seriousness of each of these matters."" 

69His Honour (a very experienced sentencing judge) was mindful of the applicant's self-punishment and genuine remorse, but was aware that the applicant's high level of culpability could not be ignored. 

70I would reject the applicant's submission that the judge did not bring into account, or gave insufficient weight to his subjective mitigating features.

71The submissions as to mental illness have been dealt with in the disposition of the first ground of appeal. 

72The applicant referred to Buddin J's analysis of sentences imposed for driving offences that resulted in the death of another party in Bombardieri v R (2010) 203 A Crim R 89; [2010] NSWCCA 161. Buddin J's extensive review included offences sometimes referred to as motor/manslaughter and offences of aggravated driving causing death. The applicant submitted that the highest sentences for an offence contrary to s 52A(2) that were reviewed in Bombardieri were ones of 8 years: see R v Woodward [2001] NSWCCA 90; R v Cousins [2002] NSWCCA 81; Thompson v R [2007] NSWCCA 299; R v Jaworowski (1999) 108 A Crim R 489; [1999] NSWCCA 430. The applicant contended that the sentence imposed by the judge was more proportional to an offence of motor/manslaughter which was said to be much more serious than a s 52A(2) offence. In a further submission, the applicant said that the 9 year sentence was greater than the upper range of the Judicial Commission statistics that were tendered during the sentencing proceedings. 

73The Crown pointed out that the Judicial Commission statistics for s 52A(2) offences disclosed that, in total, forty-seven such offences were dealt with by higher courts in this State between July 2005 and June 2012. The highest head sentence being one of 9 years, was imposed in Bombardieri and in three other matters, offenders were sentenced to head sentences of 8 years. The Crown submitted that statistics for this offence are complicated by the fact that there can be numerous combinations of death and grievous bodily harm caused in these matters and the question of totality makes isolating individual sentences difficult. 

74I do not think it is necessary to detail here those cases that Buddin J so helpfully set out in Bombardieri; however, it is useful to refer to Bombardieri, Duncan v R [2012] NSWCCA 78, and R v Cameron (2005) 157 A Crim R 70; [2005] NSWCCA 359, as these authorities were handed to the judge during the proceedings on sentence and some reliance is placed on these decisions by the applicant upon appeal. 

75In Bombardieri, an appeal against the manifest excess of a sentence of 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6½ years for one count of aggravated driving causing death was sustained. The offender had engaged in an extenuated period of dangerous driving at speeds of up to 160 kph over a significant distance, including in speed zones of 80 and 100 kph, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, to escape pursuit by a police officer. The offender's plea of guilty to the s 52A(2) offence was accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of an indictment, which also charged him with manslaughter. The offender, aged 20 years at the time of sentencing, was receiving treatment for anxiety and depression. The deceased was the driver of an on-coming utility vehicle. In the result, the offender was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years 9 months. 

76During his sentencing remarks, the judge referred to Bombardieri noting ""for example the offender in that case was much younger than the offender we have here."" His Honour remarked (ROS 16): 

""I am also mindful of the circumstances in relation to that case and there are some similarities there but no one case is identical with the other but I have taken that into account to the extent that I can.""

77His Honour's observation that no cases are identical appositely recognises the limited value of what are said to be comparative cases. In any event, there are a number of factors in the applicant's case that heighten the seriousness of his offending when compared to Mr Bombardieri. The applicant was a middle aged offender, who did not have the benefit of Mr Bombardieri's youth. Furthermore, unlike Mr Bombardieri, who was the sole occupant of his vehicle, the applicant was entrusted with the safety of two young persons in his car. The extreme speed with which the applicant drove his vehicle was aggravated by the fact that his driving ability was substantially impaired as a result of his high level of intoxication. Alcohol was not a factor in Mr Bombardieri's offending. Although the applicant was not involved in a police pursuit, his manner of driving was such that an eyewitness assumed that his vehicle was an unmarked police car involved in a pursuit. The head sentence imposed by this Court in Bombardieri was the same as the judge imposed but the non-parole period of 5 years 9 months was 6 months higher than the applicant's sentence for count one. The totality principle did not apply in Mr Bombardieri's case whereas it did in the applicant's case. I do not think that Bombardieri provides assistance to the applicant's argument of manifest excess. 

78Duncan v R concerned two counts of manslaughter and three counts of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. Prior to entering into a sweeping left hand bend, the vehicle was travelling at a speed of 190 kph or 195 kph. The offender was unable to negotiate the curve, leaving the road and then impacting with a number of trees. Two of the passengers were killed and three other suffered grievous bodily harm. For each offence of manslaughter, the offender was sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment with a further term of 4 years 6 months. The second manslaughter sentence was accumulated by a period of 12 months on the first. On each of the three counts of dangerous driving, the offender was sentenced to a fixed term of three years imprisonment. As a result of the accumulation and concurrence, the total effective sentence was 12 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 8 years. The offender's appeal against sentence and the severity of sentence was rejected.

79In R v Cameron, the offender pleaded guilty to three counts of manslaughter and one count of aggravated driving in a manner dangerous causing grievous bodily harm. The offender with four passengers in the vehicle lost control of it on a sweeping left hand turn and hit a telegraph pole. The offender had been driving the vehicle at speeds considerably in excess of 100 kph, the applicable speed limit being 50 kph and had a blood alcohol reading of 0.114 gs of alcohol per 100 mls of blood. On each of the manslaughter counts, the offender was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. On the count of aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, he was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years. The overall effective sentence amounted to a total sentence of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years. The Crown successfully appealed against the manifest inadequacy of the sentences, the manslaughter sentences each being increased to 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. As a result of partial accumulation, the overall effective sentence was increased to 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. 

80This was a Crown appeal which could only be of limited guidance on sentence for motor/manslaughter cases. McCllellan CJ at CL observed at [3]: 

""But for the fact that this is a Crown appeal in respect of which the accepted principles require the respondent to be sentenced at the lowest end of the available range to my mind a significantly greater sentence may have been appropriate. In the circumstances the sentences proposed by Grove J and with which I agree should be seen as the minimum appropriate."" (case omitted) 

81I agree with the Crown's submission that in so far as Cameron is said to set any sort of sentencing range, it could only be to indicate that a non-parole period of 7 years with a balance of term of 3 years is the bottom of the permissible range of three manslaughter offences in circumstances similar to those in Cameron. 

82It is well recognised that manslaughter is a more serious crime than the offence of aggravated dangerous driving under s 52A(2), which is reflected by the former offence carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment whereas the latter carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Sometimes the distinction in the culpability of an offender charged with the statutory offence as distinct from manslaughter will be a fine one, but that does not mean that the offender can be punished for the crime of manslaughter for which he has not been charged: R v Vukic [2003] NSWCCA 13 per Adams J at [9]; Thompson v R [2007] at [15]. 

83However, sentences imposed in motor/manslaughter cases do not set an upper limit for offences of aggravated dangerous driving causing death. The upper limit is fixed by the maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment, which remains a yardstick when assessing a sentence appropriate to the objective and subjective circumstances of the offence.

84Similarly, the upper limit of the range of sentence for a s 52A(2) offence is neither provided by the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics nor by comparative cases, but this material provides guidance and assists in achieving consistency in sentencing. As Simpson J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa said at [303]-[304]

""A history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. Such a history does not establish that that range is the correct range, nor that either the upper or the lower limit is the correct upper and lower limit. Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts.

But it would be a mistake to regard an established range as fixing the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence. To take that attitude would be, de facto, to substitute judicial selection of sentences in individual cases for the boundaries of sentencing for a particular offence laid down by Parliament...""


85To establish ground two, the applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was manifestly excessive in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357; [2005] HCA 25. Each case must be considered in light of its own facts. No two cases are the same and there is no single correct sentence: Pearce v R. 

86To my mind this is a very bad case of aggravated dangerous driving causing death. Whilst it is always possible to imagine driving that might have been more outrageous, the applicant's disgracefully irresponsible conduct is close to the worst type of offence of its kind. The judge described the applicant's driving as extraordinary and correctly found that the applicant's moral culpability was high. The applicant drove his vehicle at an extreme speed along a major highway for some 38½ kilometres whilst his driving ability was substantially impaired by alcohol. He placed not only his young passengers at great risk but also many other motorists who were travelling along the Pacific Highway. The judge did not impose the maximum penalty for the offence, but commenced with an undiscounted starting point of twelve years imprisonment. Although stern, the sentence imposed for count one was within the legitimate exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion. 

87I should mention that the partial accumulation by 6 months on the sentence for count two was generous to the applicant as the offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm to MPJ was itself very serious.

88I am not persuaded that either the individual sentence for count one or the overall sentence was manifestly excessive.





89Accordingly, the orders I propose are:

(1)Leave to appeal granted;

(2)Appeal dismissed. 

90HULME AJ: I agree with Price J.

		23 April 2013",2013-04-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761331,C v R [2013] NSWCCA 81,"Judgment
1HOEBEN JA:Offence and sentenceThe applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a charge that:
At 9.58 4 July 2010 at Baulkham Hills the accused did attempt to possess a substance, being a substance that is reasonably suspected of being unlawfully imported, the substance being a border control drug, namely cocaine, and the quantity possessed being a commercial quantity contrary to subs 307.8(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth).
The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for life and/or a fine of $825,000.
2The sentence proceedings took place over two days, 19 and 26 August 2011, and the sentence was imposed by her Honour Judge Hock in the District Court on 28 October 2011.  The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months, commencing 4 July 2010 and expiring 3 January 2021, with a balance of term of 6 years and 4 months, expiring 3 May 2027.
3The applicant has appealed against the sentence on the following grounds:
Ground 1:  The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to adequately discount the applicant's sentence on the basis of his plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities.
Ground 2:  A miscarriage of justice was occasioned as a result of the absence of evidence as to the conditions in which the applicant was, and is likely to remain, held in custody.
Factual background
4In about 2008 the Australian Federal Police commenced an investigation into the suspected criminal activity of a syndicate believed to be importing cocaine into Australia.
5The investigation concluded in about July 2010 with a number of arrests, including the applicant.  The quantity of cocaine involved in the importation had a total weight of 240.307 kgs with an estimated pure weight of between 145.5 kgs and 166 kgs.  
6The applicant was to have received half of the cocaine shipment from a Mr Gonzales, being approximately 120 kgs of cocaine with a pure weight of between 72.75 kgs and 83.4 kgs.  The estimated wholesale value of the cocaine of which the applicant attempted to take possession was between $AU22,828,500 and $AU 25,832,250.  The street value would, of course, have been much greater.  Pursuant to s 314.4 of the Criminal Code, a commercial quantity of cocaine is 2 kgs.  This offence involved a quantity of approximately 36 times the commercial quantity.
7The applicant arrived in Sydney from Los Angeles with a man named Guzman on 21 May 2010.  They stayed in two different hotels, before moving into a rental property in Baulkham Hills on 2 June 2010.  In order to secure the property, the applicant made arrangements to pay six months rental in advance in cash.  
8On 13 June 2010 the container ship, ""APL Hyundai Grace"", arrived in Melbourne with two containers on board suspected by the AFP to contain drugs.  The containers were found to contain pallets on which were loaded tiles.  Secreted within those tiles were approximately 230 kgs of cocaine.  The AFP reconstructed the tiles with inert material in place of the cocaine and repacked the pallets into the containers for a controlled delivery.
9On 3 July 2010 the applicant received and helped to unload the pallets at the Baulkham Hills property.  On 4 July 2010 at about 9.45am police officers entered the property and found the applicant in the process of breaking apart the tiles.  The applicant admitted to police that he believed it was cocaine that he was removing from the tiles.
10At the time of his arrest, the applicant was in possession of a Blackberry.  He provided police with the password to access its content.  Although the messages were in a rather crude code, it is apparent that the applicant had received instructions concerning the delivery of part of the cocaine.  The times at which the messages on the Blackberry were received was consistent with them being sent from Mexico and being received by the applicant between 8.30 and 9am on 4 July 2010.  Initially the applicant declined to be interviewed, but later that month made two formal statements to the police on 9 and 12 July 2010.
Proceedings in the District Court
11Her Honour found that the applicant was aware that he would be dealing with a large quantity of cocaine, although he may not have known the precise quantity.  Her Honour based that conclusion on the substantial funding which had been provided to him, in excess of $40,000.  He knew that he needed a car to carry something heavy, he understood ""bricks"" to mean kilograms of drugs and the message which he received demonstrated that he was to deliver a substantial quantity.
12Her Honour assessed the position of the applicant as above that of a low-level participant or courier.  She reached that conclusion because:
He came to Australia specifically to take part in the offence.
He rented the property at Baulkham Hills for six months and paid in advance.
A car was obtained which was suitable for the delivery of the drugs.
When Gonzales arrived with the drugs the applicant helped him unload them and store the pallets.
At the time the police entered the premises, the applicant was engaged in breaking the pavers and had already removed some of the substituted material.
He was in communication with two people in Mexico who were giving him instructions.
On 3 and 4 July 2010 the applicant received and sent a number of email messages in respect of the drugs.
His involvement in the delivery took place over a considerable period of time between May in the US and July in Australia.
Her Honour concluded that the applicant had played a significant role in the enterprise, but was not one of the principals.  As a result, his criminality was of a high order that must be reflected in his sentence.
13In relation to his subjective case, her Honour noted that he was aged 31 and had no prior convictions.  While this entitled him to some leniency, her Honour noted that such factors had less weight in drug importation offences.
14The applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings and relied upon a psychological report.  On the basis of that material, her Honour recorded that his parents were of Mexican background, but had migrated to New York before he was born.  The applicant was raised in the United States but maintained a cultural connection to Mexico.  He was the eldest of four boys.  His parents divorced when he was 16, due to his father's dominating and abusive attitude.  The applicant had a close relationship with his mother and with one of his brothers.  He had type 1 diabetes, but otherwise was in good health.
15He left school at the Australian equivalent of Year 9 and at that time was displaying disturbing behaviour such as attending school while intoxicated by alcohol or cannabis.  He later completed his Year 12 equivalent, obtained an associate degree in culinary arts and completed a short course in information technology.  His employment was generally in the hospitality area.
16By 18 he was binge drinking at weekends.  He continued to binge drink even after he was diagnosed with diabetes, which occurred when he was aged 25.  His use of cannabis increased as he got older and he began to use cocaine from age 16.  By age 27 he was using about two grams per day.
17The applicant had been involved in two serious long-term relationships.  The first ended when he was 22 when his partner terminated his child, which caused him to become depressed and increase his substance abuse.  He was involved for 10 months with a woman he met in Mexico but that relationship ended as a result of his imprisonment.
18Her Honour found:
""Even accepting that his judgment was to some extent impaired by his emotional state and/or depression at the time he agreed to become involved he was perfectly capable of participating in the offence and following the instructions he was given, both in the United States and here in Australia.  Further, he was motivated to become involved for financial gain.""  (ROS 7.3)
19Her Honour found evidence of remorse and that his prospects for rehabilitation were reasonable, particularly if he followed the recommendations of the psychologist in respect of participating in courses while in custody.
20The applicant provided assistance to the authorities.  Her Honour assessed that assistance in the following terms:
""He has provided assistance to the authorities.  Some aspects of that information provided were assessed as unreliable, namely his recruitment and matters relating to the Mexican drug syndicate.  However, in a significant respect his assistance was extremely useful to the authorities.  It is neither necessary nor advisable to provide further details in these remarks but they are set out in Exhibit 1 and in particular, paras 8 to 12 and para 20 of Annexure A in Exhibit B.  In respect of those matters the information was regarded as truthful and reliable.  The offender has not suffered any injury because of the assistance provided but he is understandably concerned, both for himself and for his family.  He is presently in the Special Purpose Centre at Long Bay, separated from the mainstream prisoners.  However, there is no evidence that his conditions of imprisonment will be more onerous than those of the general population.  He will, of course, be isolated from family and friends, but that factor can be given little weight when the offender came here for the sole purpose of committing this very serious offence.
I have taken into account the plea of guilty which was entered at the first available opportunity in the Local Court.  While the case against the offender was a strong one, that plea does indicate an acceptance of responsibility and a willingness to facilitate the course of justice.  I have reduced the otherwise appropriate sentence by 35 percent for the plea and for the assistance given rounding down to a whole month.""  (ROS 7.6 - 8.5)
THE APPEALGround 1:  The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to adequately discount the applicant's sentence on the basis of his plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities.
21The applicant accepted that in sentencing for Commonwealth offences, the focus is not on the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty but rather on the offender's ""willingness to facilitate the course of justice"" - Cameron v R [2002] HCA 6; 209 CLR 339.  Despite that being so, the applicant submitted that the range of available discounts in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 had been applied in sentencing for Commonwealth matters (R v Bugeja [2001] NSWCCA 196; Charkawi v R [2008] NSWCCA 159; Tiknius v R [2011] NSWCCA 215 (particularly at [82])).
22That being so, the applicant submitted that the range of discount available for his early plea of guilty was between 10 percent and 25 percent and should have been at the top of that range, given her Honour's acceptance that the plea was entered at the earliest opportunity.  The applicant noted from Tiknius v R that the plea of guilty did not include any allowance for contrition or remorse and that any allowance for those matters was to be taken into account in addition to the discount for the plea of guilty.
23The applicant submitted that the assistance which he provided was of a high level and was deserving of a much higher rate of discount than was allowed by her Honour.  The applicant submitted that although he had not given evidence, he had not been asked to do so.  Rather, the timeliness and quality of the assistance provided enabled a strong case to be brought against two other offenders so that in reality, his testimony was unnecessary.
24The applicant relied on such cases as R v Chu [1998] NSWSC 568 and R v NP [2003] NSWCCA 195 per Hodgson JA at [29] - [30] as authority for the proposition that there was a discount range of 20 - 50 percent for assistance alone.  The applicant submitted that the observation by Howie J in R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162 at [71] to the effect that Cartwright and Chu were both decided before Thomson and Houlton and were cases where the discount for assistance included the benefit to be received for a plea of guilty, was factually incorrect in that in both Cartwright and Chu there had been no plea of guilty.  The applicant submitted that this error placed some doubt on the statement of principle in El Hani.  
25The applicant relied on, and referred the Court to R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; 172 A Crim R 151 and SZ v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 19; I68 A Crim R 249.  In Sukkar Latham J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J agreed) said:
""54 While there is no fixed tariff for assistance to the authorities, discounts customarily ranged between 20 percent and 50 percent.  There have been comparatively rare cases where a discount in the order of 55 percent or 60 percent has been given.  Generally speaking however, a discount of 50 percent is regarded as appropriate to assistance of a very high order.  No doubt, that is in part a reflection of the principle that a discount for assistance must not produce a result which is disproportionate to the objective gravity of a particular offence and the circumstances of a particular offender.""
In SZ v Regina Buddin J (with whom Simpson and Howie JJ agreed) said:
""52 I acknowledge, as did Latham J in Sukkar (supra), that there will be cases in which a combined or composite discount of more than 50% is called for.  There may well be a case in which the assistance proffered is of a quite extraordinary kind.  Alternatively there may be a case in which the offender is entitled to an additional discount, in accordance with the principles enunciated in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603, on account of having disclosed information which was otherwise unknown to the authorities.  Indeed, composite discounts in excess of 50% have been allowed on several occasions when this Court has proceeded to re-sentence following a successful appeal by an offender.  See, for example, R v NP (supra);  R v OPA [2004] NSWCCA 464 and R v AMT [2005] NSWCCA 151.
53 However, in light of the authorities to which I have referred and particularly given the statutory mandate contained in s 23(3) of the Act, it is my opinion that a combined discount exceeding 50% should be reserved for an exceptional case. ...""
26On the basis of those statements of principle, the applicant submitted that although it is not appropriate to speak in terms of a tariff, the range of discounts for assistance alone was customarily between 20 and 50 percent.  He submitted that the restrictions in s 23(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and in s 16A(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) only operate to reduce the value of assistance when the sentence was likely to become disproportionately low.   He submitted that such was not the case here.  In that regard, he also relied upon R v Lenati [2008] NSWCCA 67 where a substantial discount for assistance was allowed to stand, even though the offender had not complied with his undertaking to provide future assistance.  
27The applicant submitted that on the assumption that he would have received a discount of 25 percent for his plea of guilty, the discount for his assistance must have been 10 percent.  Given the nature of the assistance, he submitted that this was patently inadequate and thus indicative of latent error in the approach of the sentencing judge.
28The applicant submitted that there is a high public interest in assistance being given which, as in the present case, leads to the detection and arrest of persons receiving large quantities of imported drugs.  Consequently, there is a strong public policy interest in encouraging persons in his position to give assistance of the nature which he did.
29The applicant relied upon the impact on him and his family of the fact that he had provided assistance.  In his evidence he referred to his fear of retribution and there was evidence from the police to the effect that he had a genuine basis for being fearful.  The applicant referred to a fear of retribution while he was inside prison, as well as outside.
30The applicant noted that the sentencing judge had acknowledged that he was being held at the Special Purpose Centre at Long Bay and would be separated from the main prisoner population.  Despite this, she was not prepared to take that matter into account in the absence of evidence to the effect that his conditions of imprisonment would be more onerous than those of the general prison population.  The applicant submitted that it was ""relatively well known"" that the conditions of custody within the Special Purpose Centre were more onerous than those experienced by the general prison population.  The applicant referred to the evidence to that effect in R v Standen [2011] NSWSC 1422 where James J noted:
""An important subjective factor is the onerousness of the prisoner's conditions of custody, compared with the conditions of custody of prisoners in the general prison population.  The prisoner is confined alone in a small cell with a small kitchenette and a small exercise yard.  For most of the period he has been in custody since his arrest he has not had any association with any other prisoner.  When he has had association, it has been with only one other prisoner.  He has no access to any programs for prisoners.  These onerous conditions of custody are likely to continue until at least the last three years of his sentence.  This is an important factor in determining the length of the sentences I should impose.""
31The applicant submitted that while it may have been desirable for detailed evidence to be put before the Court (by either party), the simple fact that the applicant was housed in the Special Purposes Centre was a relevant matter to be taken into account with respect to the discount to be allowed for his assistance.  On that issue, the applicant submitted that it was not, in the circumstances of this case, necessary for him to adduce evidence beyond the fact of his incarceration in the Special Purpose Centre.
Consideration
32A sentencing court is obliged, pursuant to s 16A(2)(g) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) to take into account that an offender has pleaded guilty.  Although there is no requirement to reduce a federal offender's sentence because of the fact of a plea of guilty, it is accepted that the general principles set out in R v Thomson; R v Houlton apply and that the range of discount should be between 10 percent and 25 percent.
33That having been said, it does not necessarily follow that the applicant would have received the maximum discount of 25 percent.  As Simpson J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Harrison J agreed) said in Tyler v Regina; Regina v Chalmers  [2007] NSWCCA 247; 173 A Crim R 458 at 114:
""[The sentencing judge] was called upon to sentence Tyler in accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in Cameron.  This specifically excludes reference to the utilitarian value of the plea.  Since the test is the willingness of the offender to facilitate the course of justice, one relevant consideration, at least in some cases, is the strength of the Crown case: this may cast some light upon the question whether the plea of guilty was truly motivated by a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, or, more pragmatically, for example, by recognition of the inevitable.  Nor is there any requirement, in sentencing Commonwealth offenders, for quantification of a discount for the plea of guilty.""
34As her Honour pointed out, the Crown case against the applicant was very strong.  Accordingly, even though his plea was entered at the earliest opportunity, it was well within the sentencing judge's discretion to have assessed the discount for his plea at something less than 25 percent.  Accordingly, it does not follow that the allowance for assistance was no more than 10 percent.
35In SZ v Regina Howie J at [9] - [11] set out the considerations to be borne in mind when a sentence is to be discounted for an offender's guilty plea and assistance.
""9 I will assume for present argument that before Thomson and Houlton the discount for assistance was given in addition to any reduction in the sentence for a plea and could extend up to 50 per cent. But in my opinion after that decision, when the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea could be as high as 25 per cent, the courts generally had less scope to give a discount for assistance where there had been an early plea of guilty. This is simply because, as I have pointed out, there is a limit to the amount to which a sentence can be discounted and yet not fall beneath the bottom line. Similarly if an Ellis discount is allowed for disclosing unknown criminality in addition to a discount for an early plea, the ability to give any further discount for whatever purpose is reduced.
10 There is in my opinion nothing unfair about this result nor is the public policy in encouraging assistance necessarily reduced. There is still on offer, even after an early plea, a discount of somewhere in the vicinity of 25 per cent, or more in an exceptional case. The simple fact is that it is more important to the administration of justice to encourage and reward early pleas of guilty. If the pursuit of that policy diminishes the ability to encourage and reward assistance, so be it. There is a greater public policy at stake and that is public confidence in the courts to impose sentences that are just and reasonable to all concerned.
11 In my opinion the application of two discrete discounts, as was done in the present case, is liable to lead to error unless the court is conscious of the overall discount being given and considers whether a discount of that degree can result in a sentence that does not infringe s 23(3). An overall discount of more than 60 per cent, however derived, will rarely, if ever, result in a sentence that is not manifestly inadequate. If then special circumstances are found and the non-parole period is reduced to say 50 per cent of the overall sentence, the unreasonableness of the sentence is magnified. It should be borne in mind that a discount in the overall sentence will inevitably result in a discount of the non-parole period. This is why it is important to avoid double counting in cases of assistance by finding special circumstances for the very same reasons that the sentence was reduced: R v S (2000) 111 A Crim R 225; R v PG (2001) 122 A Crim R 529.""
36While keeping in mind the observations of Howie J, it should be noted that the level of assistance provided by the applicant was significant.  As her Honour observed, no useful purpose is served by setting out the assistance in detail.  It is sufficient to say that the applicant actively assisted the police in the use of the Blackberry as a result of which two of the intended cocaine recipients were arrested.  Although the applicant terminated his assistance thereafter, and refused to provide further help to the authorities, the assistance which he had already provided had produced tangible and positive results.  
37Not only was the assistance useful but as the applicant explained in his evidence, he was afraid both for himself and for his family that the fact of his assistance was known to the Mexican suppliers of the drug and that retribution would be sought against him and them.  These fears were justified.  They did not depend only upon the applicant's evidence, but were supported by police evidence to similar effect.  In that regard, the activities of the Mexican drug cartels in relation to such matters are notorious.  I am satisfied that the assistance provided by the applicant has placed him and his family at real risk of harm from the suppliers of the drug.
38The fact that he has provided assistance not only renders the applicant liable to retribution when he is released, but also while he is serving his sentence.  It is for that reason that he was in the Special Purposes Centre at the time when he was sentenced.  Although no evidence was adduced as to what, if any, hardships that involved, the applicant submitted that it is well known that conditions of imprisonment in such circumstances were more onerous than those experienced by other prisoners.  He submitted that her Honour was therefore in error in disregarding this matter when assessing what discount to allow for his assistance.
39Her Honour approached this issue on the basis of the remarks of Howie J in R v Sukkar at [3] where his Honour said:
""3  As Latham J points out, the discount for assistance reflects a number of considerations that impact upon the sentence to be imposed upon the offender. One factor has traditionally been that a person giving assistance will normally be at risk within the gaol environment and, therefore, may need protection for a substantial part, if not all, of the term of the sentence. When this Court has expressed the view that the appropriate range for the plea of guilty and assistance is between 20 and 50 per cent, that range has been formulated on the basis that some reduction was due, not only to encourage others to give information to the authorities but also ""to compensate them for the more difficult conditions under which they will inevitably have to serve their sentences as a result of having given that information"", see R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 250.
4  However, it is no longer inevitable that an offender who has provided assistance will serve the sentence in more difficult conditions. As was pointed out in R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97; (2004) 145 A Crim R 304 the experience of this Court at least has been that prisoners who have provided assistance are not serving their sentences, or even a significant part of their sentences, in any more onerous conditions than prisoners in the general prison population. In Mostyn the appellant's discount was reduced when the Court came to re-sentence him because of evidence placed before this Court that indicated that he was not serving his sentence in more difficult circumstances nor was he deprived of programmes to aid in his rehabilitation.
5  It seems to me that the courts should now acknowledge the reality of the situation and reduce the range of discount to reflect the fact that one of the bases of the discount is no longer generally applicable. In my opinion discounts for a plea and assistance of more than 40 per cent should be very exceptionally, if at all, granted in a case where there is no evidence that the offender will spend the sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population.  It should now be accepted that an offender who has provided assistance will not necessarily be disadvantaged in the prison system and, if the offender wishes to assert otherwise, he or she should lead evidence of that fact.""
40That statement of principle has not met with universal approval.  It was qualified by Basten JA in R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66 at [15] and by RS Hulme J in that same case at [144].  A possible accommodation of the two approaches was set out in the judgment of RS Hulme J in R v Charman [2007] NSWSC 1177 at [20] - [21]:
""20 ...  The prisoner is currently on protection and in my judgment of the prison system, the probabilities are that that circumstance is likely to continue.  What the precise consequences to the conditions of his incarceration will be is impossible to assess, it being well known that these will depend, inter alia, on what gaol or gaols he is sent to and, whatever the reason may be, prisoners are moved frequently.  It is not possible to detail the very many previous cases where offenders coming before me have been on protection, but experience in this Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal leads me firmly to the view that the probability is that the prisoner will suffer some appreciable increase to the harshness of incarceration by being on protection.
21 (I am conscious that in that last paragraph I am differing to some degree with the appreciation of the ""on protection"" regime apparent in Howie J's remarks in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92 at [3,5] and quoted in a number of subsequent cases, including SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19.  I certainly accept that one cannot, as one previously could, draw the inference that a prisoner on protection will inevitably or very probably endure significantly harsher conditions of incarceration for the whole period he is on protection.  However, my experience is as I have indicated.)""

41The better view, in my opinion, is that an offender in the position of the applicant during a sentence hearing, if he or she wishes to gain some benefit in the sentencing process because of the conditions under which the sentence is likely to be served, should adduce evidence as to those conditions.  If the Crown disputes that evidence, it can call its own evidence, otherwise the evidence of the offender should be given appropriate weight.
42In this case the only evidence adduced was that the applicant was serving his sentence under some form of protection.  There was no evidence as to the nature and extent of restrictions, if any, which were imposed.  In those circumstances, the fact that he was serving his sentence under a form of protection should have been taken into account by her Honour but only in a general sense, i.e. that normally some additional restrictions and constraints are imposed upon a person serving a sentence in such a way.  If, however, an applicant seeks to have the conditions under which he or she is serving a sentence taken into account in such a way as to have a significant effect on the sentence to be imposed, then some evidence of those conditions needs to be adduced.
43That did not happen here.  It was an error on the part of her Honour to effectively ignore the fact that the applicant was in the Special Purpose Centre at Long Bay but in the absence of any further evidence, the weight to be given to that fact could only be modest.
44Taking those matters into account, and in particular the significance of the applicant's assistance and the resulting danger to which he and his family are exposed, I have concluded that the discount for assistance allowed by her Honour was inadequate and that the applicant will need to be re-sentenced.  
Ground 2:  A miscarriage of justice was occasioned as a result of the absence of evidence as to the conditions in which the applicant was, and is likely to remain, held in custody.
45In oral submissions the Court was advised that this ground of appeal was to be relied upon only if the applicant's first ground of appeal was dismissed.  In any event, the matters raised in this ground of appeal have been canvassed, in a general sense, when considering the first ground of appeal.
Conclusion
46Because it is necessary to re-sentence the applicant, I have taken into account the affidavit of the applicant of 13 February 2013 which deals with the current conditions under which he is serving his sentence.  In that affidavit, he deposes that between July and October 2010 he was placed in ""C Wing"" of the Long Bay Correctional Centre where his conditions of imprisonment were quite restrictive.  In October he was moved to ""B Wing"" which while still involving restrictions is a significant improvement on ""C Wing"".  While the applicant described the restrictions imposed on him in ""B Wing"", he did not indicate to what extent those restrictions exceed those to which the general gaol population is exposed.  Nevertheless, I accept that conditions within ""B Wing"" are more restrictive for the applicant than if he were part of the general gaol population and I have taken that into account.
47In assessing an appropriate discount for the applicant's early plea of guilty and his assistance to the authorities, I have to also take into account the objective gravity of the offence for which he has been sentenced and to make sure that the penalty that is imposed is not unreasonably disproportionate to its nature and circumstances.  Taking all those matters into account, I propose to apply a discount approaching 45 percent.  The actual discount which I have allowed is slightly less than that figure.  
48The orders which I propose are as follows:
1. Leave to appeal is granted.
2. The appeal is allowed.
3. The sentence imposed by her Honour on 28 October 2011 is quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years to date from 4 July 2010 and to expire on 3 July 2019 with a balance of term of 5 years and 3 months, expiring 3 October 2024.
49ADAMS J:  I agree with Hoeben JA.
50BEECH-JONES J:  I agree with Hoeben JA and the orders his Honour proposes.

		22 April 2013",2013-04-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761364,R v Ahola [2013] NSWSC 698,"Judgment

1Application has been made by the Crown for a view to be conducted as part of the prosecution case. Defence counsel has indicated that, on reflection, that application is not opposed. He has also informed me this morning that he has been instructed by the accused that he waives his right to be present. That is in the context of the accused being bail refused throughout the whole of the trial, and it having been indicated that, if he were to attend the view, the Department of Corrective Services would require the accused to be handcuffed and also perhaps to have his legs fettered. I also infer that, were the accused to be present, he would have to have prison officers in close proximity to him.

2Although the application is not opposed, it remains for me to be satisfied, pursuant to s 53 of the Evidence Act 1995, that ""an inspection be held"". I am so satisfied, and propose to deliver this short judgment to that effect. Because of the concurrence of the parties with regard to the issue, my judgment will be shorter than if there had been a full-blown controversy.

3I am satisfied that both the trial judge and the jury will be present at the view.

4I am also satisfied that both parties have been given a reasonable opportunity to be present at the view. No doubt the Crown Prosecutor and his instructing solicitor will be there. So will defence counsel and his instructing solicitor. As for the accused, I have borne in mind the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Jamal v R [2012] NSWCCA 198, and I indicate that, if the accused wishes to be present, of course he may be. Having said that, as I indicated to the parties during discussion, I do not consider it my role to interfere with the security arrangements that the Department of Corrective Services may see fit to make with regard to any such view. And it is quite understandable for the accused not to exercise his right to be present at the view, in light of the prejudice that would almost certainly accrue as a result of those arrangements.

5In short, I am satisfied of the two factors contained in s 53(2).

6I have also taken into account the five factors contained in s 53(3).

7Although the accused will not be present, as I have said, his barrister and solicitor will be there. It is not uncommon for views in criminal trials to be conducted in the absence of the accused, if he or she is in custody.

8I consider that the view will assist the jury in resolving issues of fact and understanding the evidence. My understanding of the Crown case from the opening of the Crown Prosecutor and the Crown Case Statement, which became voir dire exhibit 3, is that it is alleged that the accused bashed the deceased to death at a private home that they were sharing in Malua Bay, south of Batemans Bay. The Crown case is that the accused has said a number of inconsistent things about his movements at the home on the evening, and also perhaps that his version does not fit with the layout of the home. It is also said that the times he has given do not fit with the time it would take to walk from a shop, which he is said to have visited that evening, to the home. I have been informed from the Bar table that, although there is a plethora of photos and also an ISRAP product, there is no crime scene video. My own understanding of the layout of the home and how it fits with the Crown case generally is, at this early stage, not entirely clear. 

9I consider that inspecting the home itself, along with the distance from the store to the home, will assist in resolving facts and understanding the evidence.

10I do not consider that there is a danger that the view would be unfairly prejudicial. It has not been suggested that, for example, the jury would see something adverse to the character of the accused at the home. Nor do I consider that a view, properly conducted, would be misleading or confusing. As for the question of any waste of time, it is true that, in order to travel from the courthouse in Wollongong to Malua Bay, it will take at least 2.5 hours each way. However, the trial is listed for four weeks, and I consider that, in context, the loss of five hours travelling time is reasonable.

11I have been informed by the Crown Prosecutor that, to his knowledge, the layout of the home generally has not been materially altered since the date of the alleged offence, namely 18 October 2011. Of course, the distance from the site of the shop to the home cannot have changed.

12Finally, and speaking more generally, it is my own experience that a view of the scene of an alleged crime very much aids one's understanding of that scene in a way that goes beyond what can be achieved through photographs, maps, and the like.

13In all of the circumstances, I consider that the application of the Crown, unopposed by defence counsel, should be granted. It is proposed that the view will take place on Thursday 2 May 2013.

		03 June 2013",2013-04-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761365,R v Elabdallah [2013] NSWDC 260,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Mouhamed Elabdallah appears for sentence consequent upon his adhering to guilty pleas to the following four offences:

Sequence 1: aggravated armed robbery upon the Cedars Tavern at Emerton on 14 June 2011; 

Sequence 3: conspiring between 16 July and 25 August 2011 to commit an aggravated armed robbery on the Crown Hotel Revesby;

Sequence 4: aggravated armed robbery on the Brewhouse at Lalor Park on 23 September 2010; and

Sequence 5: aggravated armed robbery upon the El Toro Hotel, Warwick Farm on 5 June 2011.

2Aggravated armed robbery has a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period. Conspiracy has no maximum penalty and no standard nonparole period but it is relevant to consider the maximum penalty for the offence the subject of the conspiracy. None of the offences to which he pleaded guilty can be dealt with summarily.

3When considering his criminality in connection with sequence 4, the Court took into account an offence of aggravated kidnapping on a Form 1 schedule and in connection with sequence 5 two aggravated kidnapping offences on a Form 1 schedule. Aggravated kidnapping, when dealt with on indictment, has a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment.

4The Court reduced the sentences by about twenty-five per cent to reflect the utility of his guilty pleas. 

5The guilty pleas relieved the victims of the anxiety of awaiting a trial and giving evidence in that trial. The material before the Court satisfies the Court that the conditions referred in subpara 21A(3)(i) are met and there is evidence that the Offender is remorseful. Although that remorse is belated, the Court is of the view it is appropriate to and has extended leniency to reflect that remorse.

6The co-offender Milad Salama was, at the time of the offences, employed as a security guard and had been employed in that role in excess of a decade. The facts assert that he was working for a particular security firm in 2011 and that he worked at the Brewhouse Hotel between May and September that year five to six nights a week. That is probably a misprint and it is probably meant to refer to the year 2010 rather than 2011. Part of his duty included remaining at the premises after it was closed to the public and whilst staff counted money from the tills and poker machines before placing it into a safe. On occasions he would assist staff to clear money from the poker machines. The Offender knew the co-offender Salama and the other co-offender Stefano Marconi. 

7On 7 September 2010 the co-offender Salama sent a text message to the Offender containing the address of the Brewhouse Hotel. In the early hours of 22 September 2010 the Offender met with the co-offender Salama and hatched plans to commit an armed robbery at the Brewhouse Hotel early the following morning. These plans included that the offence would take place whilst the co-offender Salama was working as a security guard. He provided the Offender with information about the Brewhouse that he had obtained in the course of his employment. 

8The Offender and the co-offender Marconi met on the evening of 22 September at the co-offender's house. They then travelled to the Brewhouse Hotel together. The manager of that hotel was preparing to close at around 1.50am. All patrons had left, leaving only the manager and the co-offender Salama who was still working at a security guard. After the hotel was locked, the co-offender Salama stood next to the door and the manager Mr Pastor commenced to get the cash from the poker machines and put it in pencil cases. Shortly after 2am, the Offender and the co-offender Marconi approached the rear of the hotel. At the time they had their faces covered with balaclavas. The Offender had a small axe, which he used to break a glass panel next to the door lock. He and the co-offender Marconi then entered the hotel, one of them being armed with a handgun. They grabbed hold of the co-offender Salama, the handgun was pointed to his back and one of the offenders demanded to know where the manager was. The co-offender Marconi escorted the two offenders to the poker machine area where he pushed the co-offender Salama to the ground. 

9The Offender who had the axe approached the manager Mr Pastor and told him to put everything on the floor and get on his knees. The victim knelt on the floor and put his keys on the floor next to him. The Offender demanded the code to the safe but was told it was open. He then told Mr Pastor to stand up. Mr Pastor said: ""Take whatever you want, just don't hurt us"". 

10The two offenders ordered Mr Salama and Mr Pastor to a bench and ordered them to kneel. They were told not to look at the offenders. They tied the hands and legs of both Mr Pastor and the co-offender Salama. They removed a mobile phone, some cigarettes and key from the pocket of the co-offender Salama. The co-offender Marconi remained with the other two whilst the Offender went into the office and collected the money. When he returned he demanded the password to the second safe, but Mr Pastor told him it could not be opened. When he demanded the password for the till Mr Pastor told him what the password was, the Offender then opened the till and removed some cash from it. 

11In all the two perpetrators left the premises with $58,000 in cash. They had been inside the premises for about twelve minutes. 

12The tying up of the arms and feet of Mr Pastor gives rise to the kidnap on the Form 1 schedule. He was able to free his legs and then cut the ties to Mr Salama who then cut the ties to Mr Pastor's hands. Triple-0 was contacted. The co-offender Salama provided a statement to the police falsely claiming he was a victim of the offence.

The aggravated armed robbery on the Brewhouse Hotel is reflected in sequence 4. 

13Sequence 5 involved the offence at the El Toro Hotel on 5 June 2011. The co-offender Salama had previously worked as a security guard in this hotel. On 18 May 2011 the Offender made a number of phone calls to the phone number of the co-offender Salama. At about 6.55am on 5 June 2011 the Offender entered the beer garden of the El Toro Hotel in company with his co-offender Mousa Houri. At the time they were both wearing black balaclavas. They walked up a set of stairs out of the beer garden and out of view of the CCTV camera system. The hotel was closed at the time. At about 7.18am the manager Nina Makisi arrived for work and walked into the beer garden. As she was about to open the door into the bistro the two offenders ran down the stairs to the beer garden and approached her from behind. When she turned around she saw they each had a firearm. One of them demanded that she opened the door and she did as requested. One of them said that she was not going to be hurt, they just wanted the money. She showed them where the office was located and started to open one of the safes. It had a time delay lock of ten minutes on it. She indicated that the lock to the second safe was kept in the first safe. Whilst they were waiting for safe to be opened, another employee Aliz Shrestha arrived. One of the offenders pointed the firearm at Mr Shrestha's head and directed him away from the office. After he lay on the floor, his ankles and hands were secured with duct tape. After the first safe was opened, the offenders removed some bags of coins. Ms Makisi then opened the second safe and the offenders removed cash from it and put into a backpack. One of the offenders used a twoway radio and said: ""bring the car"". After Ms Makisi lay on the ground, duct tape was used to tie her hands together as well as to tape her legs together. 

14The offenders left the hotel at 7.35am taking with them $21,132 in cash. The two victims freed themselves from the duct tape. The detaining of them gives rise to the two matters on the Form 1 schedule.

15Police arrived shortly afterwards and seized a number of exhibits including the duct tape used to tie up the victims. Subsequent DNA analysis of material lifted from the duct tape was matched with the Offender's DNA profile.

16The next offence in time is reflected in sequence 1. It was committed at the Cedars Tavern at Emerton on 14 June. This hotel is located in Popondetta Road at Emerton. The co-offender Salama had been employed at this premises as a security guard during June 2011. During June of that year he provided the Offender and the co-offender Mousa Houri with information about the tavern that he had obtained during the course of his employment. Over the long weekend, which was 10 to 13 June, there were several telephone communications between the Offender and the co-offender Mousa Houri. During these they arranged to meet. 

17At about 12.30pm on 13 June the Offender sent a text message to the co-offender Mousa Houri stating: ""Just get shit together, I'm in"". The Offender and the co-offender Mousa Houri met at Haymarket later that afternoon that is on 13 June. 

18Police surveillance saw the co-offender Essa Houri driving a Toyota Yaris motor vehicle owned by an associate of his by the name of Mohamad Aboulhaf. He went to a service station at Wiley Park and purchased a jerry can and some fuel. 

19At about 2.30am, during a telephone conversation with the co-offender Mousa Houri, the Offender agreed to meet the co-offenders Mousa and Essa Houri at their home in Roselands.

20At about 4am on 14 June the only person in the Cedars Hotel was the manager, the victim of the offence. A security guard had left the premises about fifteen minutes earlier. The victim went into the office, locked the door and began counting $50,000 of takings that had previously been collected from various parts of the premises. The proceeds for the four to five previous nights were held in a drop safe that the victim could not access. 

21At around 4am the Offender and his co-offender Essa Houri approached the tavern and used a hammer to smash a panelling in one of the glass doors. They gained entry to the tavern. At the time they were wearing balaclavas that concealed their faces and each of them carried a handgun. When they knocked on the victim's office he saw them pointing the firearm through the window and hid in a nearby toilet. One of the offenders kicked the door to the office open and the pair stole $50,000 cash before fleeing in a silver-coloured car. 

22The Yaris previously referred to was set alight at about 4.30am the same morning in Kilto Crescent at Glendenning. Fire fighters extinguished the fire. Police located a jerry can on the front seat of the burnt-out car, which was similar to the one purchased by the co-offender Houri earlier that night. The car was set alight about 500 metres from the home of the co-offender Salama. The offenders travelled to his home and the proceeds were divided between them.

23A motor vehicle registered in the name of the wife of the co-offender Salama dropped the co-offender Mousa Houri off at Blacktown Railway Station at 5.05am. Police followed him and he later attended university near Campbelltown that morning. The co-offender Aboulhaf reported the theft of his motor vehicle later that morning. 

24Over the ensuing days, surveillance revealed that the co-offender Salami and the Offender argued over how this offence had been executed. Some of the details of those conversations are set out on the facts, but it is not necessary to reproduce them in these remarks. However, the conversations reveal that the Offender had used his share of the proceeds of the robberies to fund the purchase of a 2009 model Hyundai Elantra, as well as furnishings and appliances for his apartment at Bankstown.

25The final offence is the conspiracy offence, which is sequence 3. Between 16 July 2011 and 25 August 2011 police lawfully intercepted a number of telephone calls between the co-offender Marconi and the Offender. During these calls the two formed an agreement to commit an armed robbery using a dangerous weapon at the Crown Hotel in Revesby. The co-offender discussed with the Offender his intention of obtaining information about the trade of the hotel from a person associated with it. The pair agreed to provide the informant with an amount of money in return for the information. They outlined their plans that they would observe the hotel prior to the commission of the offence. During their conversations they referred to the hotel as a job site and the robbery offences as contracts. Details of the evidence gathered during the surveillance are set out in the facts on pages 8 to 12. The Court has taken that evidence into account but it is not necessary to set that detail out in these remarks. The Court notes, however, that they did meet outside the hotel at about 10.30pm on 3 August 2011.

26Police arrested the Offender at 12.10am on Thursday 25 August at Beverly Hills. At the time he was driving the Elantra motor vehicle previously referred to. After he was taken to the Hurstville Police Station police interviewed him. During the interview the Offender told the police that he worked as a security guard and provided information about where he was employed and the sort of work he did in that role. He also acknowledged the use of a particular Vodafone mobile phone number and told the police that he had moved to Bankstown about four weeks earlier. He told the police that the Elantra he was driving when they arrested him had been purchased using cash at Pickles Auction and it cost him $13,000. He claimed he obtained that money from his employment. He set out the details of his income, which he said varied. He told the police he used cash to buy the furnishings for the place that he was living in at Bankstown. He acknowledged knowing the cooffenders Salama, Marconi and Mousa and Essa Houri. He said he did not own a security company but kept his eye out for the opportunity to earn a commission from security contracts. He acknowledged that he had met the co-offender Marconi near the Crown Hotel sometime previously. He declined to comment when questioned directly about the aggravated armed robberies.

27The Offender turned twenty-nine last December. He is the second youngest of a family of seven children. Whilst there was no evidence that he had the disadvantage of a dysfunctional upbringing, there is evidence of some family discord because of his father's gambling problems. It seems that there was limited discipline in the home because his mother spent a lot of time working and his father spent a lot of time gambling. 

28The Offender has been married for about five years. He has twins who are about two years old and another child about a year younger. 

29After leaving school, he worked teaching martial arts for a number of years. During this time he undertook a lot of voluntary work in that field, including at schools. After a falling-out with his master, he started working as a security guard. 

30He started using cocaine in around 2010 because it helped bulk him up and gave him more confidence and bravado. He is prepared to undertake programs to address its usage, but has not been able to do so thus far because he has been on remand. 

31There is evidence that he started to develop a gambling problem when he was about twenty. As noted, his father had a gambling problem and apparently one of his brothers also has a gambling problem. The evidence suggests that he has some insight into his problem and is prepared to address it in the future. 

32He has undertaken some vocational courses in goal and has not breached prison discipline.

33The Court considered each offence separately.

34Dr Jacmon is of the opinion that the Offender has a combination of three problems that affected his state of mind at the time of the offences and/or when he decided to become involved in offences of this type. Those three problems were: pathological gambling; anxiety; and steroid use. He set out the symptoms one would expect in a person with each of these problems at p 1 under the heading ""Conclusions"" within exhibit 1. It is not necessary to set the detail of those symptoms out in these remarks. 

35The Court has considerable reservations about this report because Dr Jacmon never met the Offender before preparing the report or giving evidence. He only spoke to the Offender on the phone for about an hour and relied entirely upon what the Offender told him during that conversation when reaching his conclusions. 

36Whilst the Court accepts the Offender had a gambling problem, his wife's evidence raises a real doubt about the level of the Offender's gambling problem. She did not assert that there are any substantial financial problems and there was no suggestion in the evidence of either the Offender or his wife that they had trouble putting food on the table. It is possible that the Offender conveyed to Dr Jacmon that his gambling caused him anxiety about being able to feed his wife and children, however, in all the circumstances, the Court cannot exclude the possibility that Dr Jacmon concluded that the Offender's level of gambling was higher than was the case.

37In relation to the combination of the three problems he identified Dr Jacmon opined that the Offender's: 

""actions which led to offending indicated markedly diminished capacity for judgment because there appeared to be little thought given to the consequences and the need to curb impulsivity. 

38The Court does not accept this opinion because:


1.it cannot exclude the possibility that his conclusion about the level of the Offender's gambling problem does not reflect the reality in that regard;

2.although during his evidence the Offender said he told Dr Jacmon about the conversations he had with his co-offender Salama that led to his involvement in the offences, Dr Jacmon made no mention to them either in his report - exhibit 1 - or his evidence;

3.the Offender's account about those conversations is at odds with Dr Jacmon's opinion. The Offender said that, before becoming involved in any of the offences, his co-offender Salama spoke to him about three to four times saying things like: it would be easy; there was so much money; and no-one would get hurt. He also said that the co-offender Salama was aware of his gambling and was constantly at him and he, the Offender, needed money. He went on to say that he trusted the guy and regarded the offending suggested by his co-offender Salama as his best option for him and his family. He added that he always knew that what he was doing was not right and was against his own beliefs. In summary, according to the Offender's account, the co-offender Salama dangled a pot of gold in front of him and, having weighed up his options, he succumbed to the temptation as he saw it as an easy way out. Further, in a process of illogical reasoning, he saw it as a means of becoming ""someone"" in his family's eyes. Later in his evidence the Offender said he always knew people - a reference to the victims - were scared, but that was not in his mind. He also said that he saw each offence as the last and could pull out if he wished but claimed he needed the money. In the Court's view these parts of the Offender's evidence are inconsistent with the evidence of Dr Jacmon to the effect that, having decided to be involved, the Offender ""had to"" commit the offences, meaning the Offender has no option to withdraw. In this context the Court notes that during a telephone conversation with his co-offender Marconi on 28 July 2011 that forms part of the evidence in support of the conspiracy offence and which is after the three robberies the Offender said:

""Well I'm going to do that regardless man, 'cause at the end of the day, I want the contract but, I don't want it bad enough that one of us gets hurt. .... I really look at shit as much as I can. it's just fuck man, like I can't get one of us in trouble."" [my emphasis];


4.in the Court's view the Offender's evidence is inconsistent with his decision-making being impulsive and lacking in consideration of the consequences;

5.the Offender wore a disguise when he committed the three actual robberies. During his evidence Dr Jacmon sought to explain this by saying words to the effect that, pretty much, all criminals know they have to avoid capture. In the Court's view this indicates that he was approaching the matter in a stereotypical way rather than a consideration of the circumstances of the individual case. For that reason the Court did not accept his explanation;

6.on a number of occasions in connection with the Offender's original decision to become involved in these offences, which in his view was an impulsive decision, Dr Jacmon said that the Offender thought he was smart enough to get away with it. This conveys to the Court that the Offender thought about the consequences, at least for himself, but decided to go ahead with the offences, which is not consistent with what is connoted by the term ""impulsive"";

7.there was a significant temporal gap between the offence in September 2010 and the next offence on 5 June 2011. Another nine days passed before the next offence on 14 June. The evidence discloses that planning for that offence started as early as 11 June. Further, the conspiracy spanned well over a month and only ended because of the Offender's arrest. Dr Jacmon's evidence about the Offender having no option but to continue his involvement once he decided to become involved does not sit comfortably with these temporal gaps, especially the period of almost nine months between the first and second offences;

39In the Court's view it is clear on the evidence, including the Offender's evidence, that the Offender considered the options when the Offender Salama dangled the pot of gold before him during a number of conversations and appreciating the risks for himself and potential victims, decided to become involved, taking the risk that he would be arrested. The Court is also of the view that, after each offence and before involvement in the next, he went through a similar exercise. The Court is satisfied of those matters beyond a reasonable doubt. It is also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that, whilst he was partly motivated by a desire to obtain money to continue gambling, he also wanted money for his family and to live extravagantly so he could take time off his paid employment and eat out all the time. To the extent that his gambling motivated his offending, that explains but does not excuse his conduct. 

40It is clear from the Offender's account that he chose to obtain funds by committing offences of this type, including the use of firearms, as a means of obtaining money and viewed it as a business. The Court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that, but for the intervention of the police, the conspiracy would have resulted in another actual aggravated armed robbery and there may have been even more. What he said to the co-offender Marconi on 28 July 2011 in the passage quoted above and during evidence indicates he was prepared to continue offending so long as he was not caught, he and the co-offenders were not hurt and victims were not physically hurt.

41The circumstances are such that he was involved in serious organised criminal activity. Clearly the offences were premeditated and committed after some planning in which the Offender participated. His role was that of an actual perpetrator. 

42Obviously each offence was serious and involved a firearm that falls within the definition of dangerous weapon. On each of the three occasions where a robbery was actually committed, the Offender was in company and, it seems likely, that that was the case in connection with the one the subject of the conspiracy. On the first occasion only one offender had a firearm, described in exhibit A as a handgun, and there is no basis to conclude that the Offender carried it. However, on that occasion the Offender did have a small axe. On the next two occasions each of the perpetrators had a firearm, described as a handgun in connection with the offence at the Cedars Tavern, and a firearm at the El Toro Hotel. 

43Whilst no victims were tied up during the offence at the Cedars Tavern, victims were tied up in order to facilitate the execution of the offences at the Brewhouse Hotel and the El Toro Hotel. Although that is reflected in separate offences on the Form 1 schedules, the Court did not increase the aggregate sentence or the indicative sentence for sequences 4 and 5 to reflect the matters on the Form 1 schedule because it had taken the detention of the victims into account when assessing the level of criminality for sequences 4 and 5.

44On each occasion inside information was used to facilitate the planning and execution of the offence and that was obviously part of the plan for the offence the subject of the conspiracy.

45Apart from the occasions when victims were tied up, there was no manhandling of people during the commission of any of the offences and there is no evidence that any victim sustained any physical injury during any of the offences. There is no evidence about whether the firearms that were loaded, they certainly were not discharged. No threats were uttered, but obviously the use of firearms conveyed a significant threat. Obviously the victims would have been terrorised. Even though there are not victim impact statements, it is not uncommon for a victim of an offence such as these to suffer long-term emotional and/or psychological problems.

46On each occasion significant amounts of money were stolen and the Court is satisfied this is why hotels were targeted. There is no evidence that any of the stolen money has been recovered.

47The Offender has been in custody since his arrest. He has not breached any prison discipline rules and has done a number of vocational courses. He has positive plans for the future and has taken his religion more seriously. He has thought about the consequences of his offending behaviour. He has a work history and support in the community. If he successfully addresses his gambling problems his prospects of rehabilitation and not re-offending will be good. The Court accepts that he has acknowledged his gambling problem and he is receptive to professional help to address it.

48Two co-offenders have been sentenced.  On 12 December 2012 Judge Wells sentenced the co-offender Essa Houri to sixty-three months imprisonment with a non-parole period of forty-two months in connection with the offence committed with this Offender at the Cedars Tavern. Her Honour accumulated the sentence upon other sentences for three offences of a similar nature committed by the co-offender Essa Houri on two hotels and in which this Offender was not involved. The co-offender Essa Houri received a total sentence of seven years and three months with a non-parole period of five and a half years.

49On 22 April 2013 Judge North sentenced the co-offender Salama to: three years with a twenty month non-parole period for the offence on the Brewhouse Hotel; twenty months imprisonment with fifteen months non-parole for being an accessory before the fact to the offence at the Cedars Tavern; and twenty months with twelve months non-parole for being an accessory after the fact to the offence committed at the Cedars Tavern. The Court notes that the matter has a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment, while the maximum penalty for the other two is twenty-five years imprisonment. His Honour accumulated the sentence in connection with the offence on the Brewhouse Hotel by six months, giving a total sentence of three and a half years and a total non-parole of twenty-six months.

50So far as the evidence discloses the relevant similarities between the three offenders are as follows:


discount for utility of their respective guilty pleas; 
none of them had any prior criminal history; and 
totality considerations.

51So far as the evidence discloses the relevant differences between the three offenders are as follows: 


Age. This Offender is about fifteen years younger than the co-offender Salama and about nine and a half years older than the co-offender Essa Houri. In the latter's case, unlike in the case of the other two, his relative young age was relevant in terms of balancing, deterrence and retribution; 
criminality. Whilst there is no basis to distinguish between the criminality of this man and the co-offender Essa Houri in connection with the offence at the Cedars Tavern, it is clear that the co-offender Salama's criminality was less, even though it involved a significant breach of trust, and in terms of charging was dealt with in an entirely different fashion. In connection with the Brewhouse, notwithstanding the breach of trust on the part of the co-offender Salama, the Court is satisfied this Offender's criminality is greater; 
the co-offender Salama received a discount of 20% assistance to the authorities. In the case of the offence committed at the Brewhouse Hotel, his Honour indicated that but for the 45% discount [for the utility of the plea and assistance] the sentence would have been five and a half years and in the case of being an accessory before the fact to the offence at the Cedars Tavern four years, and in the case of the other offence three years. The Court notes that his Honour ordered that the sentences for the two offences at the Cedars Tavern be served concurrently; 
unlike the other two, the co-offender Essa Houri had the disadvantage of a dysfunctional upbringing, had suffered significant injuries in a motor vehicle accident and displayed a poor attitude in custody, suggesting his prospects of rehabilitation are not as good as the other two, and her Honour found a slight reduction in moral culpability because of mental health issues; 
unlike the co-offender Salama, the other two had substance abuse problems of some sort when they committed the offences.
 
52Bearing in mind those similarities and differences, the Court applied the principle of parity as between this man and the other two when considering the offence at the Cedars Tavern and between this man and the co-offender Salama when considering the offence at the Brewhouse.

53The Court has not made any formal reference to the Offender's record but it will be obvious from what it has already said that it has extended a discount or a leniency because of the absence of prior offences.

54The Court notes that the Offender's eldest twin suffers from alopecia, the onset of which may have been triggered by the Offender's arrest and their subsequent separation. As a result she suffered significant hair loss and her mother shaved off the balance. She also suffered loss of eyebrows and eyelashes. Obviously this has been stressful for the child and her mother, as well as the Offender. Further, his wife and family have experienced financial difficulties whilst the Offender is in custody. However, these matters are not so exceptional that leniency on the discrete basis of hardship to third parties is called for. However, they are subjective features that the Court took into account.

55The Court took into account for purposes of a sentence and a sentence of imprisonment is a sentence of last resort. As the purposes of sentencing are well known, there is no need to discuss them in any detail. 

56In the Court view significant custodial sentences are called for in connection with each offence. The Court has concluded that it is appropriate to impose an aggregate sentence under s 53A and that sentence reflects a twenty-five percent discount, as does the indicative sentences.

57In determining that sentence, that is the aggregate sentence, the Court considered totality and, in the cases of sequences 4 and 5, the matters on the respective Form 1 schedule. The Court will commence the sentence on the date of his arrest. Because of the absence of prior offences and the issue of totality the Court found special circumstances.

Pursuant to subpara 53A(2)(b) the indicative sentences are as follows: Sequence 3: forty-two months.

Sequence 1: sixty-six months.

Sequences 4 and 5: sixty-nine months. In connection with those two matters the indicative sentence reflects of course the matters on the Form 1 schedule that were taken into account in assessing the overall criminality of each offence.

58Mouhamed Elabdallah, the Court convicts you of the four offences to which you pleaded guilty in the Local Court and, pursuant to s 53A imposes an aggregate term of imprisonment. It fixes an aggregate non-parole period of six years and an aggregate total term of nine and a half years to commence on 25 August 2011. The Court orders that your parole eligibility date is 24 August 2017.

59I have sentenced you to a total of nine and a half years imprisonment with six years non-parole commencing when the police arrested you. This means you are eligible for release to parole on 24 August 2017. You should understand that release to parole on that date is not automatic. Some time before that date the State Parole Authority will hold a hearing and decide whether to release you on parole on that date or some later date. If you are released to parole you will be subject to stringent conditions. It is your job to both understand what those conditions are and to stick to them whilst you are on parole. If during the time that you are on parole you breach any condition the State Parole Authority will revoke your parole and you will have to go back to gaol to serve the balance of your sentence. Do you understand?

60OFFENDER: Yes.

2761378,Langbein v Regina (No. 2) [2013] NSWCCA 100,"Judgment
1THE COURT: The Court pronounced orders disposing of the appeal and publishing its reasons on 26th April 2013. It has come to our attention that there is an error in the orders pronounced. Order 4 does not accord with the Court's intention as stated at [57] in the joint judgment of Fullerton and Campbell JJ. The error is a merely clerical one, in the nature of a slip.
2Rule 50C(3) of the Criminal Appeal Rules is in the following terms:
Within 14 days after an order is entered, the Court may of its own motion set aside or vary the order as if the order had not been entered.
3Ordinarily an order is taken to be entered when it is recorded in the Court's computerised record system, typically on the day on which judgment was handed down: Rule 50B(2). These rules were fully discussed by this Court (Simpson, Blanch and Rothman JJ) in Akkawi v R (No. 2) [2013] NSWCCA 72.  It is not necessary to go over that ground here. Suffice it to say that the rule amply empowers the Court to correct the ""slip"" made when the orders were pronounced, and entered, on 26th April 2013: R v Jones; R v Hili (No 2) [2010] NSWCCA 195; 79 NSWLR 143 at [34]. 
4The Court echoes the views expressed in Akkawi (No. 2) at [27], whilst it well appreciates the effect that the alteration to the orders pronounced may have on the appellant, nevertheless there was an obvious inconsistency between the clear intention expressed at paragraph [57] of the joint reasons, with which McClellan CJ at CL agreed, and the orders pronounced. As in Akkawi (No 2) the corrected orders still substantially reduce the sentence imposed at first instance.
5The orders pronounced on 26th April 2013 are set aside and the Court makes the following orders:
1.  Grant leave to appeal.
2.  Appeal allowed.
3.  Confirm the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge in respect of the offence of driving whilst disqualified including the period of disqualification imposed by his Honour.
4.  Otherwise, the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge are quashed and the following sentences are imposed in substitution:
(a)In respect of the offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 committed at the C4 Café, the applicant is sentenced to 3 years imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 17 February 2011 and expiring on 16 May 2013, with a balance of term of 9 months commencing on 17 May 2013 and expiring on 16 February 2014;
(b)In respect of the offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 committed at the Devine Café, the applicant is sentenced to 4 years and 6 months imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 17 May 2011 and expiring on 16 May 2014, with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months commencing on 17 May 2014 and expiring on 16 November 2015.

		01 May 2013",2013-04-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761405,Mammone v R [2013] NSWCCA 95,"Judgment

1LATHAM J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against an aggregate sentence of 10 years, with an aggregate non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months, imposed upon him following pleas of guilty to manufacture a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) and knowingly take part in the supply of not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. 

2Eight offences, including possess a loaded firearm in a public place, two counts of supply cocaine, three counts of possessing a false instrument and one count of dealing with proceeds of crime, were taken into account for the purposes of sentencing on the manufacture charge.

3Each offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The applicant received a sentence of 10 years, including a non-parole period of 6 years and 2 months for the manufacture offence. A fixed term of 4 years and 6 months was imposed for the supply offence, and was partially accumulated on the previous sentence in order to extend the non-parole period by 6 months. This latter sentence was not open to his Honour, but the applicant makes no complaint about that.

4The grounds of the appeal raise parity issues, questions relating to the assessment of the objective gravity of the offences and complain that the sentence is ""too severe"".

The Offences

Manufacture Commercial Quantity of Methylamphetamine

5The applicant's arrest followed a police investigation into the suspected manufacturer of prohibited drugs at a rural property near the township of Marulan, north of Goulburn.

6The electricity supply to the property was in the applicant's name. Surveillance by police and lawfully intercepted telephone calls demonstrated that the applicant attended the property on 29 October 2009 and thereafter on a number of occasions. The property was also visited on numerous occasions by associates and relatives of the applicant.

7Police executed a search warrant on 30 November 2009 and noted the presence of a quantity of equipment consistent with a clandestine laboratory for the manufacture of methylamphetamine in a shed on the property. A covert audiovisual recording device was installed in the shed on 11 December 2009.

8As a result of that device, a number of members of the extended Mammone family were recorded in connection with the manufacture of methylamphetamine. They included the applicant's father, the applicant's cousin, the applicant's brother-in-law, one Bruno Romeo, Marcio Francisco and Kurt Minard.

9The applicant and Romeo were arrested in Kings Cross on 19 December 2009 after police had observed the applicant supplying a quantity of cocaine to Romeo. A search of the applicant's vehicle revealed a loaded .22 handgun which was in a bag under the passenger seat. The applicant admitted supplying Romeo with cocaine and he admitted that another bag of cocaine was intended for himself and his girlfriend. Cash in the sum of $480 was found in the applicant's pocket. These offences appear on the Form 1. Following his arrest on these offences, the applicant was released to bail on 4 February 2010.

10Whilst the applicant was still in custody, the applicant's father and brother-in-law were recorded on the surveillance devices entering the shed at the property, and removing glassware and other materials from the clandestine laboratory.

11On 20 February 2010, the applicant returned to the rural property in company with his brother-in-law. The surveillance equipment recorded both men entering the shed. The applicant was observed checking the doors and windows and looking in drawers.

12On 26 February 2010 the applicant's cousin and Kurt Minard entered the shed at the property and carried in a number of boxes. They unpacked boxes which contained glassware and chemicals capable of being used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. They inspected the glassware, repacked the equipment into boxes and moved some items to an adjoining room before leaving.

13On 28 February 2010 a number of telephone intercepts recorded conversations between the applicant, his cousin and another person about transporting someone referred to as the ""labour"" to the shed. The reference to the labour was a reference to Kurt Minard. Minard assisted the applicant's cousin in the manufacturing process on three occasions in March 2010.

14On 3 March 2010 the police again entered the property and retrieved the audiovisual recordings up to that time. Forensic samples of precursors to the manufacture of methylamphetamine were obtained. Police observed evidence of the recent manufacture of methylamphetamine.

15The next day, the applicant, his cousin and Romeo travelled to the property in order to commence the manufacture of methylamphetamine that afternoon. On 5 March 2010, Kurt Minard arrived at the property. All four men were recorded inside the shed whilst methylamphetamine was being manufactured. The applicant and Romeo left the property some hours before the process was completed.

16On 8 March 2010, the applicant's cousin and Kurt Minard returned to the property and entered the shed. They set up manufacturing equipment and carried out the manufacture of a quantity of methylamphetamine.

17On 9 March 2010, the applicant and another man arrived at the property and entered the shed. They were recorded wearing gloves at a table in the corner of the shed. The other man left the shed with a transparent container of liquid.

18On 10 March 2010 the police again entered the shed. Methylamphetamine and pseudoephedrine were detected in various containers. A quantity of equipment and a quantity of precursor chemicals were also found in the shed. A shipping container on the property contained sieves and vessels that appeared to have been used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine.

19At no time did police seize the product of the manufacturing process. The applicant's plea was entered on the basis that the quantity of methylamphetamine manufactured in the shed was not less than the commercial quantity, when account was taken of the three identified occasions when the manufacturing process was recorded. A quantity of 995 g was particularised in the indictment, being an estimate of the total amount of the drug manufactured over the relevant period.

Supply Commercial Quantity of Methylamphetamine

20In late January 2010 a series of intercepted telephone calls between the applicant, his cousin and Vince Monteleone recorded a discussion about the potential supply of a quantity of methylamphetamine to Monteleone whose intention was to on-sell the drug to a third party at a profit.

21On 9 February 2010, the applicant's cousin further discussed the price and the timing of the supply. Other discussions were recorded on 15 and 22 February 2010, the latter between the applicant and Monteleone. The applicant indicated that the material could be supplied but Monteleone required further time to arrange the on-supply.

22During these calls, there was a reference to ""260"" which was taken as a reference to price. This figure forms the basis of the particular as to the quantity of the drug that was offered for supply.

23On 24 February 2010 Monteleone phoned the applicant and told him that the third party was not able to proceed at that time.

Grounds 1, 2 and 3 : the Severity of the Sentence

24Ground 1 is framed in the following terms : ""The sentence imposed was in the circumstances too severe."" This ground does not discriminate between the individual sentences imposed for two discrete offences and, in the light of grounds 2 and 3, can only be taken to refer to the aggregate sentence. 

25Ground 2 alleges error in the finding that the offences fell into the mid range of objective gravity.

26Ground 3 asserts that the sentencing judge erred ""in finding the manufacture count was aggravated by the precipitating arrangements for the supply"" offence.

27On the hearing of the appeal, senior counsel for the applicant contended that the relevant test for the purposes of establishing error under ground 1 was that the sentence was ""too severe"", not that it was manifestly excessive. Counsel maintained that the language of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 dictated that result and that there was a distinction, albeit a fine one, between ""too severe"" and ""manifestly excessive"".

28This submission must be rejected. Any inquiry on an appeal against sentence begins with the identification of error, either patent or latent. Where a specific error has not been demonstrated, the court may nonetheless conclude that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust. In the latter circumstance, the sentence is described as manifestly excessive : Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25 at [25] ; Hili v The Queen ; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45, at [59].

29Manifest excess and ""too severe in all the circumstances"" are on occasions used interchangeably in grounds of appeal before this Court. On every occasion when such a ground has been entertained, the Court has made it abundantly clear that there is no principled difference between those respective expressions. The applicant's counsel provided no authority to the contrary.

30Grounds 2 and 3 assert patent error. I will deal with these grounds before returning to ground 1.

The Objective Gravity of the Offences

31The sentencing judge found that this applicant and Pino Mammone (the applicant's cousin, who was sentenced jointly with him) were involved in a large and sophisticated clandestine laboratory in an isolated area. His Honour went on to find that :-

there was considerable and careful planning, premeditation as well as concealment in the operation and use of the premises. A significant quantity of precursor chemicals were found, as well as a large volume of a variety of prohibited substances. Their discussions indicated an involvement in most, if not all the operations.
There was a relatively large workforce involved in the total operation, which appears to have been organised, and at the relevant time organised by them from within people known to them, either the extended family, friends or community.

32On this basis, the judge found that the objective criminality of the manufacturing offence was serious and at least in the mid range. His Honour acknowledged that the Crown had submitted that the objective gravity was not very far below mid range. The applicant's senior counsel acknowledged that his Honour was not bound by the Crown's assessment.

33With respect to the supply offence, his Honour had regard to the terms of the offer to supply, including the quantity of the drug, its price, that it was motivated by reasons of commercial gain, that the applicant at all material times appeared to have the intention to fulfil the offer as well as the capacity to fulfil the offer. His Honour also had regard to the fact that there was no actual supply, but ultimately found that the objective criminality was ""of the order of mid range"". 

34The applicant contends that the assessment with respect to the manufacturing offence was not warranted in the light of the fact that there was no evidence of a ""long term highly organised structure"" and no evidence of a security system involving armed guards, electronic surveillance ""or other indicia of an established and highly sophisticated organisation"". In the same vein, the applicant contends that there was no evidence of ""an established distribution process for an ongoing manufacturing organisation"". In support of that contention, the applicant submits that the supply offence suggested an ad hoc event.

35The objective gravity of an offence is not determined by the absence of features that would elevate it into a different category of objective seriousness. Positing hypothetical offences of greater objective gravity does not assist in determining where the particular offence lies on the scale of objective gravity. The assessment must be carried out on the basis of what is known, rather than by conjecturing what factors may have made it more objectively serious. The reference to armed guards and electronic surveillance is curious, given that these are rarely indicia of clandestine laboratories. The capacity to manufacture large quantities of illicit drugs depends upon the maintenance of the appearance of normality in a low-key setting.

36With respect to the supply offence, the applicant submits that it was Monteleone who initiated the offence and that there was no evidence that the applicant was to receive any greater remuneration than Monteleone. These factors are said to support the finding by the judge sentencing Monteleone (Murrell SC DCJ) that the supply offence should be placed at the low end of the range. His Honour adverted to that assessment and disagreed with it. In any event, whether or not it is accurate to describe Monteleone as the initiator, the fact remains that the applicant was the source of the drug to be supplied. It may be legitimately inferred that the manufacturer of the drug would reap a profit in excess of the difference between the ""wholesale"" and the ""retail"" price of the drug. 

37An assessment as to the objective gravity of any offence is a discretionary judgment. This Court should be slow to interfere with such an assessment by a sentencing judge, unless the discretion has miscarried for the reasons explained in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499. The applicant has not demonstrated that his Honour mistook the facts, failed to take into account a relevant consideration, took into account an irrelevant consideration or acted on a wrong principle. His Honour's assessment is not unreasonable or plainly unjust.

38There is no substance to ground 2.

The Relationship Between the Manufacture and the Supply Offences

39The applicant contends that his Honour in effect aggravated the sentence on the manufacturing offence by taking into account the supply offence when determining sentence on the former. 

40The applicant relies upon the following passage in the remarks on sentence :-

I need to make the specific finding on the questions of relativity and parity. Pino and Franco Mammone were essentially the principles of the manufacturing operation, particularly in their organisational roles, recruiting others, being actually involved in the manufacture, as well as in the marketing and sales end of the overall operation. They were also clearly involved in the commercial profit discussions with Mr Monteleone and indirectly with third parties.

41This passage appears under the heading ""Comparative Role of Offenders"". It is obviously directed at parity considerations. There is no substance to ground 3.

42Returning to ground 1, I am not persuaded that the sentence, either in respect of each offence or in the aggregate, is outside the range of a legitimate sentencing discretion. Given that each offence carries a standard non-parole period of 10 years' imprisonment, and that the judge found (appropriately) that the objective gravity of each offence was in the mid range, the aggregate head sentence of 10 years demonstrates a somewhat generous approach towards the applicant.

Grounds 4 - 7 : Parity with Monteleone, Romeo and Minard

43The applicant claims that his Honour dismissed the significance of the sentence imposed on Monteleone and/or that he has a justifiable sense of grievance with respect to the sentence imposed upon Monteleone. Monteleone only stood for sentence on the isolated count of supply. He received a non-parole period of 11 months with a balance of term of 20 months.

44The applicant also claims a justifiable sense of grievance with respect to the sentences imposed upon Romeo and Minard respectively. They each stood for sentence only on the manufacture count. Romeo received a non-parole period of 12 months, with a balance of term of one year and three months. Minard received a non-parole period of two years and three months with a balance of term of two years and three months.

45Disparity giving rise to appellate intervention must be ""marked"". The imposition of different sentences does not, without more, raise ""equal justice"" considerations. Moreover, a sense of grievance is only ""justifiable"" or legitimate if the application of objective criteria compels the court to that conclusion. The age, background, criminal history and role in the offence of various offenders may justify some disparity : Green v The Queen ; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49 at [31].

46In particular, as the majority in Green & Quinn make clear,

A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders. 

47On the supply offence, his Honour unfortunately imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of four and a half years, contrary to law. Section 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which permits a court to decline to set a non-parole period does not apply to a standard non-parole period offence: SGJ v R; KU v R [2008] NSWCCA 258 at [76] - [78]. Six months of that sentence was accumulated on the non-parole period imposed for the manufacture offence. The applicant does not complain that that modest degree of accumulation was not warranted in the circumstances of the case. 

48Having regard to the debate on the question of whether a fixed term otherwise represents the non-parole period or the length of the head sentence (see Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 per Hulme J), there is nothing in the remarks on sentence that explicitly indicates what the judge intended in that regard. Given that the supply offence carries a standard non-parole period of 10 years and that his Honour assessed the objective gravity of the supply offence in the mid range, it is reasonable to conclude that the fixed term represented the non-parole period. Both the Crown and the applicant approached the matter on that basis on the hearing of the appeal. In the result, a re-sentencing on this basis ought make no difference to the aggregate non-parole period or aggregate sentence, assuming no other basis for intervention : Hristovski v R [2010] NSWCCA 129 ; Lipchin v R [2013] NSWCCA 77.

49Returning to the complaint concerning the sentence imposed on Monteleone for the supply offence by Murrell SC DCJ, it is not correct to assert that his Honour ""dismissed the significance of the sentence"" or disregarded it in any material respect. The remarks on sentence for Monteleone was an exhibit in the sentencing proceedings. His Honour referred to those remarks on a number of occasions in the course of his remarks on sentence.

50There were a number of significant differences between the applicant and Monteleone, namely the latter had no prior criminal history, there was nothing to indicate that he had ever been involved in the distribution of drugs prior to the instant offence, and there was a justifiable finding that there was no prospect of re-offending, thereby reducing the importance of personal deterrence in the sentencing exercise.

51By way of contrast, the applicant had a prior criminal history, including convictions for possess prohibited drug in 1999 and 2001, and convictions for possessing an unauthorised firearm in 2001 and 2005. The applicant was on bail for firearm and drug offences when the discussions with Monteleone took place. His Honour was not convinced of the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation.

52In short, these were qualitative and discretionary judgments made by his Honour with respect to the applicant that were entirely justified in the circumstances of this case. It was open to his Honour to depart from Murrell SC DCJ's assessment of the offence. In my view, her Honour's assessment was unduly generous towards Monteleone. 

53It may be accepted that the disparity is ""marked"" if one accepts that the fixed term represents the non-parole period. However, as I have already noted, the sentence for the supply offence is all but totally subsumed by the sentence for the manufacture offence, so that, even if intervention were warranted in order to reduce the extent of the disparity, it would make no practical difference to the outcome, assuming no basis for intervention on the manufacture charge. 

54Turning to the manufacture offence, the judge made several findings with respect to the roles of the applicant and Pino Mammone. No issue is taken by the applicant with those findings. As noted at [40], his Honour found that the applicant was essentially a principal in the manufacturing operation, who played an organisational role which included recruiting others, and oversighting the manufacture with a view to selling the end product. A notional head sentence in the order of twelve and a half years for the manufacture offence, taking into account the offences on the Form 1, resulted in a head sentence of 10 years after the application of a 20% discount for the plea of guilty. 

55Romeo's sentence was the result of the application of a combined discount of 45%, comprising a 20% discount for the plea of guilty and an additional component for assistance provided by Romeo to the authorities. The applicant maintains that Charteris SC DCJ adopted a starting point of 5 years. Leaving to one side the discount applied for the offender's assistance, the applicant submits that an appropriate comparative notional head sentence for Romeo was one of four years, that is, less than half of the notional head sentence for the applicant.

56The applicant acknowledges that there were significant differences between the applicant's role and that of Romeo, but submits that these differences do not justify the disparity between the respective sentences.

57Charteris SC DCJ sentenced Romeo on the basis that his role was limited. The applicant and his cousin were described appropriately as the organisers of the enterprise. The Crown described Romeo as a ""rouseabout"", in that he played a role inferior to that of the ""cook"". Romeo's counsel and the Crown agreed that the offender's criminality fell below that of Minard. It was accepted that Romeo was using cocaine in the time leading up to his arrest and that he was expecting to receive some financial gain for his contribution. The judge accepted Romeo's assistance was ""very significant"". His prospects of rehabilitation were considered promising.

58In addition to those differences, Romeo had one prior offence of custody of a knife and one for possession of cocaine. His remorse was assessed as genuine. Significantly, there were no offences on a Form 1 to be taken into account when imposing the sentence on the manufacture offence.

59Having regard to these matters, the respective roles played by the applicant and Romeo and the corresponding differences in their culpability, I am not persuaded that the disparity gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.

60Minard was sentenced by Norrish QC DCJ on the basis that he played a relatively limited role compared to that of the applicant. Minard was recruited to work for a wage by the principals of the organisation, which included the applicant. He was described as a cook who performed functions at the direction of others. He was paid on a per diem basis and was therefore not going to receive any share in the profits on the sale of the drug. Minard's entry into the enterprise was relatively late and he had no prior association with the applicant or the other principals.

61Minard was said to be truly contrite with good prospects of rehabilitation. He was not on conditional liberty at the time of the commission of the offence. Personal deterrence was not significant in the sentencing exercise and his circumstances in custody were said to be harsher than those experienced by the general prison population.

62A notional starting point of 6 years before the application of a 25% discount for the plea of guilty appropriately, in my view, reflects Minard's culpability relative to that of the applicant. The applicant has not established any basis for intervention on this ground.

63There is no merit in grounds 4, 5, 6 and 7.

64I would grant leave to appeal on sentence, but dismiss the appeal.

65BUTTON J : I agree with Latham J.

66GROVE AJ : I agree with Latham J. I wish expressly to associate myself with her Honour's remarks concerning the asserted distinction between the phrases ""too severe"" and ""manifestly excessive"".

2761406,RRS v R [2013] NSWCCA 94,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Hall J.

2HALL J: The appellant, RRS, by Notice of Appeal dated 26 July 2012, appeals against his convictions in respect of offences against two complainants (referred to in this judgment as 'A' and 'B').

3The appellant was charged with three counts of aggravated sexual assault on his son 'A', a person then under the age of 10 years (Counts 1, 2 and 4) and in the alternative to Count 2, aggravated indecent assault (Count 3). The appellant was found not guilty of Counts 1 and 2 and guilty to Counts 3 and 4.

4The appellant was also charged with two counts of aggravated indecent assault on his son, 'B', a person under the age of 10 years, and was found guilty of both counts. 

5Between February 2005 and April 2008, the appellant had full-time custody of the two complainants following a relationship breakdown and the making of orders under the Family Law Act 1975.

6The complainants' mother, referred to in this judgment as Ms X, had lived with the appellant for a number of years. In the early part of 2005, her relationship with him commenced to break down. She was also experiencing a lot of personal difficulties at that time. 

7On 12 October 2005, the Family Court of Australia set out custody and access arrangements in relation to the complainants. After the orders were made, Ms X saw the complainants two or three times a year.

8A first trial in relation to the alleged offences commenced on 15 February 2010, but was aborted later that week. A second trial commenced on 22 February 2010 but was also aborted on 26 February 2010. A third trial commenced on 15 June 2010. Verdicts were delivered on 23 June 2010. 

9As indicated above, the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of four of the six counts on the Indictment, and not guilty verdicts in respect of the remaining two counts.

10The Notice of Appeal pursuant to s 5(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 originally pleaded two grounds. At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal, Ms Loukas SC for the appellant, stated that Ground 1 (as it was then framed) was no longer relied upon, but leave was sought to amend the Notice of Appeal to add a new ground, which became Ground 1 in the Amended Notice of Appeal. The Crown did not oppose the amendment. Accordingly, leave was granted to file the Amended Notice of Appeal which contained two grounds including the ""new"" Ground 1. The Amended Notice was filed in this Court on 21 November 2012.

11They are in the following terms:

GROUNDS OF APPEAL

(1) There has been an error of law in that his Honour failed to give the jury a direction in accordance with R v Mayberry [2000] NSWCCA 531.

(2) There has been an error of law in that there were no good reasons for his Honour failing to give the jury a warning pursuant to s 165 with regard to hearsay evidence.

FACTS

12The offences with which the appellant was charged were alleged to have taken place in the home of the appellant. The offences in respect of which he was convicted were alleged to have taken place between 31 December 2006 and 4 April 2008.

13The younger of the two complainants, 'B', first complained to his mother during an access visit on 6 April 2008. Ms X then spoke to the other son, 'A', following which she contacted police to make a statement. Senior Constable Daniel Hickson thereafter attended upon Ms X on the same day and recorded certain details of the conversation that he had had with her in his notebook. I will return to discuss the significance of the account given to Senior Constable Hickson below. He did not speak to the complainants on that day. 

14The complainants were interviewed by police on 14 May 2008. Following the interviews, Ms X had a conversation with 'A' who disclosed further details involving the appellant. Ms X subsequently contacted police, which led to 'A' being re-interviewed.

15Police conducted two further interviews with 'A' on 22 May 2008 and 4 July 2008.

16'A' was aged 9 years at the time of the police interviews. At the time of the police interview with 'B' on 14 May 2008 he was then aged 8 years. 

17It is noted that the defence case was, in essence, that the allegations made against the appellant were false. In support of the defence case it was contended that 'A' and 'B' were telling lies. Their alleged motivation for making the allegations was said to be a desire to move back with their mother. It was also part of the defence case that the complainants' mother Ms X hated the appellant and it was suggested that she had coached the complainants to make the false allegations so that she could obtain custody of them.

GROUNDS OF APPEAL

Ground 1 - There has been an error of law in that his Honour failed to give the jury a direction in accordance with R v Mayberry [2000] NSWCCA 531

18In support of Ground 1 brief written submissions dated 20 November 2012 on behalf of the appellant were relied upon. They extracted, at [2], paragraphs [37]-[40] from the judgment of Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) in R v Mayberry [2000] NSWCCA 531. The argument in support of Ground 1, though not developed in the written submissions was addressed in oral submissions for the appellant. In the written submissions it was simply stated:

""Applying the relevant law as stated in Mayberry to the Appellant's case it is clear that his Honour was obliged to give such a direction, in particular in relation to count 4 and did not."" 

19It was acknowledged in paragraph 4 of the written submissions that counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial did not suggest such a direction. Accordingly, Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. In this respect, it was submitted for the appellant that, there being no Mayberry direction, there had been a miscarriage of justice in that the appellant may have lost the chance of acquittal which was fairly open to him.

20In oral submissions for the appellant, the decisions in R v Mitchell (NSWCCA, 60321/94, 5 April 1995, unreported) and R v Mayberry were referred to. On the central question as to collaboration or collusion, it was submitted for the appellant that ""... there is a suggestion of collaboration, and when you go to the summing up in this matter, in particular at page 30 of the summing-up, it is quite clear that collaboration is an issue"": (T 21 November 2012 at p 12.40-45).

21The submission for the appellant in support of the contention that the trial judge was obliged to give such a direction, including, in particular in relation to Count 4, was wholly based upon the Mayberry principle. 

22In the course of her oral submission, Senior Counsel for the appellant, submitted:

""... if this evidence comes in the jury is left in the situation of, what do we actually do with the other brother's evidence? We have a direction about context evidence, but what do you do about the evidence on the other count involving the other brother? The jury are left in the dark about that and it's not enough to say, we submit, well the judge has said, deal with each count separately. That's not enough in a case of this nature, because the jury is left with two brothers, and the normal lay person's idea of that is, well, they are both there for each other. If they accepted what [B] says, then it's more likely the jury might think in lay person's terms that what [A] says is correct. But if you can't follow that process, then the evidence is not cross-admissible"": (T 21 November 2012 at 13-14).

23Ms Loukas submitted that there was no basis for distinguishing Mitchell and Mayberry as relevant authority: in this respect it was observed:

""... so that basis of distinguishing Mayberry and Mitchell in Collins is simply not available here, because this does raise collaboration and concoction, and that is squarely raised at page 30"": (Appellant's Submissions at T 21 November 2012 at 12.45-50).

24In R v Collins [2001] NSWCCA 386, this Court (Mason P, Sully J and Newman AJ) considered an appeal in which one ground contended that the trial judge erred in not directing the jury that the evidence of the complainants, referred to as AB and NB, could not be used as proof of the guilt of the appellant in offences involving the complainant KM.

25In that case, the appellant had been charged with 13 counts. These included 2 counts of aggravated indecent assault, 2 counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, 1 count of employing a person under 18 years for pornographic purposes, 6 counts of aggravated sexual intercourse with a person aged between 10 and 16 years, and 2 counts of supplying a prohibited drug. 

26The appellant pleaded guilty to the drug supply charges and after a trial he was found guilty on the 11 remaining charges.

27In this summing up, the trial judge directed the jury that they were required to decide each charge on its own merits but did not expressly direct the jury that they could not use the evidence of NB to support the evidence of KM, nor was he asked to give such a direction. It was submitted that the failure to do so constituted a miscarriage.

28In Collins it was noted that the appellant placed reliance upon statements in Mitchell and Mayberry. The Court of Criminal Appeal in Collins analysed the circumstances in each of those cases. Reference was made to the observations of Gleeson CJ in Mitchell, inter alia, to the effect that the trial judge in that case was obligated to warn the jury in clear terms against using the evidence of one complainant towards proof of the guilt of the appellant of offences involving the other complainant.

29Mason P in Collins, stated:

""104 In my view it is not appropriate to take the first paragraph of the passage just quoted out of context and to elevate it into a principle of law that would require the giving of the direction for which the appellant now contends. The vice of the summing up in Mitchell was that the absence of the warning of the kind suggested by Gleeson CJ meant that the jury might well have understood that the evidence of one complainant was admissible towards proof of Mitchell's guilt generally. The failure to give appropriate warnings was coupled with exhortations by the trial judge to consider the totality of the evidence in the case when coming to their decision.

105 The same cannot be said of the summing up in the present case. There was much more than exhortations to consider the charges separately, although those exhortations appear to have been more strident than those in Mitchell. In the present case Judge Ducker was at considerable pains to emphasise that the counts involving the complainant KM depended upon the jury accepting KM's evidence of them. There was no invitation to use evidence in one count as evidence of the other nor to use the background or contextual evidence in any inappropriate way. On the contrary there were clear directions as to the limited use that could be made of the latter type of evidence.

30Mason P examined the observations made by Beazley JA in Mayberry and quoted the observations made at [38] in her Honour's judgment. Mason P then observed:

""108 Nevertheless, it is significant in my view that Beazley JA proceeded to examine the summing up as a whole to determine whether the appellant in Mayberry might have been deprived of a fair trial. She looked at passages emphasising the importance of considering each charge separately. As in Mitchell, there were aspects of the summing up which effectively encouraged the jury to consider the totality of the evidence in the case when coming to their decision. At one stage the charges were referred to as a 'job lot'. Furthermore, when the trial judge in Mayberry dealt with the essential elements of the offences he dealt globally with the counts spanning the two complainants. The charges were lumped into categories where the common elements were emphasised in circumstances that essentially merged the separate cases relating to the two complainants ...""

31Finally, Mason P set out observations of Beazley JA in Mayberry at [54] of her Honour's judgment and then at [110] in Collins stated:

""110 Once again the present case can be distinguished on a number of grounds. There was never a serious suggestion of collaboration between the complainants. And, unlike Mayberry there was no tendency to 'roll up' the charges touching the two complainants.""

32The Crown in its response submissions, submitted that the decisions in Mitchell and Mayberry are not authority for the proposition that there is an invariable requirement in cases involving multiple complainants to warn the jury against using the evidence of one complainant towards proof of guilt of an offender for offences involving another complainant: R v Collins [2001] NSWCCA 386 at [113]; R v Dennis (2010) 202 A Crim R 453; [2010] SASC 69 at [40]. I interpolate that South Australia has not adopted the uniform evidence legislation and continues to apply the common law of evidence including the rules relating to the admissibility of similar fact evidence. Vanstone J's analysis needs to be read with this consideration in mind.

33The Crown's detailed submissions (Crown Response to Additional Ground dated 26 November 2012) closely analysed the decisions in Mitchell and Mayberry. In paragraph 4 of the Crown's Response Submissions it was observed:

""4 In the present case, there was never any serious or specific allegation of concoction or collusion, as between the complainants, made during the trial. Specific allegations of coaching and concoction were only made against the mother of the complainants. In fact when the issue of concoction between the complainants was raised by the Crown (during examination in chief) there was an objection by counsel for the appellant ...""

34The Crown's written submissions, ""Crown's Response to Additional Ground"" attached a document, Annexure 1, entitled - ""Summary of Extracts of Evidence where Issue of Concoction or Collusion was Raised"" which related to transcripts of the evidence of each of the complainants given at trial on 24 and 25 February 2010 and of 'B' on 17 June 2010. 

35It is to be remembered in this case that the two complainants were quite young at the time of the police interviews. 'A' was aged 9 years at the time of the interviews in which he participated and 'B' was aged 8 years at the time of the police interview with him on 14 May 2008. In contrast in Mayberry, apart from count 10 in that case, the complainant NRD was 7-8 years of age at the time of the offence and the complainant JMD was 11-12 years of age.

36In the present proceedings at trial the defence case pursued the issue as to the possible influence of the complainant's mother on the two complainants, and that any such influence could have affected their evidence. The Crown noted that there was never any application to recall either or both of the complainants so that any allegations of concoction or collusion between them could be specifically put: Crown Response Submissions at [5]. An application was made for the complainants to be called for cross-examination, but not on the question of them colluding with one another to fabricate evidence. 

37The Crown further observed that defence counsel at trial was not precluded from putting any such allegations at trial although she was clearly aware of the possibility of concoction. Reference in this regard was made to the transcript of 7 June 2010 at 10.25. However, defence counsel at trial did not, as I have noted, pursue the question of collusion between the complainants as a specific basis for seeking to recall either of them. 

38The basis of the application that was made to recall both complainants was set out in a document entitled ""Defence Application pursuant to Criminal Procedure Act - 306J"". The application was supported by the affidavit of Anthony Parsons dated 15 June 2010. The Crown observed that, by way of background, the issue arose during the cross-examination of 'B' and it concerned the issue of the conversation which 'B' said he had had with his mother on 6 April 2008 (T 25 February 2010 at pp 108-112). Copies of that transcript form Annexure A2 to the Crown's Response Submissions.

39The Crown also noted in its Response Submissions at [6] that on 16 June 2010 counsel for the appellant at trial prepared a further document headed ""Proposed Scope of further cross-examination of [B] pursuant to Ruling on ss 306J(1) Application"": (T 16 June 2010 at p1.24-4.25). That document, as the Crown observed, did not seek to raise collusion or concoction as between the complainants as an area for cross-examination (a copy of the document was annexed to the Crown submissions at Annexure 6).

40It was further noted in the Crown submissions:

""8 No application for separate trials was ever made. This was a case where the appellant relied heavily upon the lack of common features and inconsistencies in the evidence as between the two complainants"".

41It is clear from the transcript that the way in which the defence case was conducted was not to suggest that the two young complainants, as it were, ""put their heads together"" to concoct evidence. The main approach to their evidence was to highlight to the jury the absence of common aspects and inconsistencies in their accounts.

42On the question raised in the appellant's submissions as to ""cross-admissibility"" the Crown referred in oral submissions to the issue of the admissibility of evidence with respect to particular counts. In respect of Counts 5-6, which involved 'B', there was no evidence from 'A' that was admissible on those counts. The reverse applied with respect to Counts 3 and 4 involving 'A'. There was no admissible evidence for 'B' to establish those counts.

43In her written submissions in reply, Senior Counsel for the appellant referred to six passages from defence counsel's address to the jury, which Senior Counsel submitted, taken together adverted to the possibility of concoction either at the instigation of the boys' mother or as between themselves. She submitted ""[t]he possibility of concoction as between the complainants, is averted to on the basis of broad outline and not as a carefully planned concoction"" (sic). Senior Counsel relied in particular on the following excerpt: 

""I am certainly arguing that, on the defence case, that both [A] and [B] are lying, they have to be ....

But I am not suggesting to you, that given their ages, if you think about it, that they've sat down together carefully planning precisely what details they're going to give, exactly what story they're going to tell; I am not suggesting that at all."" (T 22 June 2010 at p 13, [35]-[45].)

Decision

44On examination of the transcript, I do not consider that there was any affirmative submission made alleging collaboration or collusion between the complainants. Counsel for the appellant in fact disavowed any such proposition. It is also worth bearing in mind in Collins Mason P was fully cognisant that in summing up, the trial judge had reminded the jury ""of the defence suggestions that the three girls had put their heads together"": Collins at [48]. Of itself, in his Honour's view, this was insufficient to mandate a direction in accordance with Mitchell and Mayberry.

45The fact that there was no serious suggestion of collaboration or collusion between the two complainants is, as it was observed in Collins, a significant matter.

46Furthermore, there is no suggestion that the summing up in this case ""rolled up"" the charges concerning the two complainants.

47I accept the following submission in the Crown's Response:

""10 The present case is much closer to Collins than to Mitchell or Mayberry. In the present case there was never any suggestion made at trial that the evidence from one complainant could be used or was capable of being used towards proof of the allegations of the other complainant. Nor was such a direction ... requested. There were no issues of ""cross-admissibility"" raised at trial. The evidence of each complainant was either inconsistent with or provided little support for the evidence of ... either. Unlike the situation in Mitchell and Mayberry in the present case, his Honour said nothing in the summing up that may have encouraged the jury to use the evidence in one count as evidence for the other, nor to use the background or contextual evidence in any inappropriate way. The charges concerning the respective complainants were not 'rolled up'."" 

48In his summing up, the trial judge gave the jury a direction in the following terms:

""... this being so, unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [A] and [B] are honest and accurate witnesses in the accounts they have given you cannot find the accused guilty. Before you can convict the accused you should examine the evidence of each complainant, depending upon which count you are considering, very carefully, in order to satisfy yourself that you can safely act upon the evidence to the highest standard required in a criminal trial.

That caution is not based upon any personal view that I have of either of the boys or their evidence. I told you at the outset of this summing-up that I would not express my personal opinions on the evidence but in any criminal trial where the Crown case relies solely or substantially upon the evidence of a single witness a jury must always approach that evidence with particular caution because of the onus and standard of proof placed upon the Crown namely, proof beyond reasonable doubt. I'm not suggesting to you that you are not entitled to convict the accused upon the evidence of [A] or [B], depending upon which case you are considering. Clearly you are entitled to do so but only after you have carefully examined the evidence and satisfied yourself that it is reliable beyond reasonable doubt."" (Summing Up 22 June 2010, at p 14-15).

49The Crown correctly observed that it is significant that counsel for the appellant at trial did not seek a direction in the terms now being sought.

50I accept as the Crown submitted, that the trial judge emphasised to the jury that caution had to be exercised by them and that they were required to carefully consider the reliability of each of the complainants, separately in respect of each relevant count.

51I have concluded that no error has been established by the trial judge in not giving a direction in terms specified in Mitchell and Mayberry. That is, the trial judge did not, in my opinion, err in not giving a specific direction that in respect of each count evidence given by 'A' could not be used in respect of the offences alleged against 'B' and vice versa.

52Having regard to the way in which the case was conducted, and the issues upon which the defence case was based, there was no requirement for a direction as alleged. Accordingly Ground 1 should, in my opinion, be dismissed. 

Ground 2 - There has been an error of law in that there were no good reasons for his Honour failing to give the jury a warning pursuant to ss 165 with regard to hearsay evidence

53In the course of her evidence, Ms X gave evidence of complaint by both complainants, 'A' and 'B' in evidence in chief (T 17 June 2010 at p 17 at 15, p 20 at 37 and in cross-examination, (p 23-28).)

54The evidence of complaint was admissible pursuant to s 66 of the Evidence Act 1995. The effect of s 66 is that first-hand hearsay is not excluded by the hearsay rule in criminal proceedings where the person who made the representation is available to give evidence. Accordingly the evidence is admissible to prove the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint provided that the evidence meets the test of relevance and subject to any judicial discretion for excluding it. The evidence is also admissible to support the credibility of the complainant or complainants.

55The credibility of the complainants, and their mother, Ms X, was very much in issue in the trial. The alleged events constituting the offences charged were disputed with the appellant contending that they did not occur. What the complainants are alleged to have said to their mother, and what became in the trial, complaint evidence, and what they had said to police in police interviews, and what their mother had said to police, were all very much disputed.

56Accordingly, the jury were required to assess the reliability of each complainant, and Ms X, in these various aspects.

57The issue of a direction under s 165 of the Evidence Act was raised on two specific occasions during the defence case. On 21 June 2010, the fifth day of the trial, counsel appearing for the appellant stated that an application would be made for a s 165 direction:

""MOEN: I'll be making an application for a 165 direction on the grounds of the hearsay, that first complaint, 6 April 2008.

HIS HONOUR: But that's true of all complaint evidence?

MOEN: It is your Honour yes, but I will be arguing that in my submission. It falls into a category where section 165 --

HIS HONOUR: What above and beyond the normal complaint direction?

MOEN: Yes your Honour I'll be asking for that.

HIS HONOUR: Alright, what's the formal warning you want?

58Counsel appearing for the appellant stated that the draft direction that would be sought was not immediately available and the matter was left to be raised at a later time. The trial advocate stated at T 33:

""TRIAL ADVOCATE: I don't think your Honour needs to go beyond what's in the normal direction.""

59Later in the day the question was again raised (T 44):

""HIS HONOUR: The uncharged acts what's the warning you want me to give above and beyond what's already in the complaint direction?

MOEN: Your Honour, I'd be asking your Honour to indicate this to the jury that because the complaint evidence is hearsay, that may cause it to be unreliable. In this particular case, three particular features may cause it to be unreliable, that is, the delay between 6 April 2008 and 11 June 2008.

HIS HONOUR: What's that delay?

MOEN: That's the delay between [Ms X] hearing the hearsay on her account and when she has cause to actually herself make an accurate record when she provides her statement.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

MOEN: That may run the risk of a distortion of honest memory because of the passage of time.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

MOEN: The second general problem is that the version that [Ms X] has told the jury about is not, I use the word 'corroborated' and it may not be the correct one but nor corroborated by evidence by [A or B]. It's not necessarily contradicted but this isn't a case where they have acknowledged that they said - or [A] - [B] has acknowledged that yes, he did indicate each of those details to her and did the demonstration. In addition, with [A] his evidence was in fact that he denied anything happened, and beyond that doesn't tell anything about whether he said yes or why he said yes or what he meant. So that there isn't corroboration of the hearsay as told to [Ms X].

HIS HONOUR: Do you understand that --

MOEN: --and the third that the reason [Ms X] says she was told is not fully corroborated by a contemporaneous record from the police officer. It is corroborated to some extent I concede but it's not - and he has explained the reason for that but --

HIS HONOUR: Yes I am not with you in relation to that but what do you say about 1 and 2 Crown?

TRIAL ADVOCATE: Well your Honour the version, in the Crown's submission, is corroborated by what [B] says in the sense that he was asked questions about what he said he saw--

HIS HONOUR: What he says he said to his mother is different?

TRIAL ADVOCATE: It is alleged that he said that he saw the accused shanking [A] and that's the nature of his evidence in the trial.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

TRIAL ADVOCATE: So it's not--

HIS HONOUR: I don't propose to give any additional direction.

MOEN: Your Honour, I haven't completed my submissions on - 

HIS HONOUR: Go on--

MOEN: Firstly to respond to my friend, I think my friend has misunderstood. It is not that it is not corroborated, it's the hearsay. We don't have evidence here from [B] saying, not only do I remember talking to my mother, but I agree I told her these things that she says I told her and I did the demonstration that says. We don't have the evidence in this case.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

MOEN: Which makes it a little more unusual than some. I'm asking your Honour to consider telling the jury that it is the experience of the courts that sometimes honest witnesses can be mistaken, and that they should scrutinise the hearsay component with care for those three general reasons. That completes my application your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I will think about it. Yes let's have the jury back thanks. ...."" (T 44-45)

60The three matters raised in support of the application for a s 165 direction were:

(i) The delay between Ms X hearing the hearsay complaints and providing or making her statement to police. This was said to involve a risk of a ""distortion of honest memory"" by reason of the passage of time.

(ii) That the version that Ms X gave in evidence was not ""corroborated"" by evidence from 'A' or 'B' (though it was acknowledged that the evidence was not necessarily contradicted).

(iii) That the version Ms X says she was told by 'B' was not ""fully"" corroborated by a contemporaneous record from the police officer (this being a reference to the absence of a record by Senior Constable Hickson of the fact that Ms X said that 'B' demonstrated what was referred in the trial to as ""shanking"").

61The issue of delay referred to in (i) (a period of approximately two months) was said to carry a ""risk"" of distortion of honest memory by reason of the passage of time. This was not a matter referred to in s 165(1)(a) to (g). The delay was not a particularly substantial one. It would not, in the circumstances of the case, in itself, render Ms X's account as being ""unreliable"" to such an extent as to attract the need for a warning under s 165. The possible significance of delay was a matter to be tested in the evidence but not as a basis for s 165 to operate.

62The matters referred to in (ii) and (iii) were, in effect, relied upon to support the proposition that the absence of what was referred to as corroboration of the complaint to Ms X in some way rendered the evidence of Ms X, as to complaint, unreliable.

63The evidence given by Ms X as to what she was originally told by the complainants was given on 17 June 2010 at T 17.19. Her evidence related to the verbal account given to her by 'B' and the subsequent conversation she said she had with 'A', 'A' being, according to her, reluctant on that occasion to reveal or say anything to her about what had occurred.

64Apart from the verbal accounts provided by 'B' to Ms X constituting the ""complaint"" evidence, Ms X's evidence was that on 6 April 2008 'B' gave a demonstration as to alleged assaults he said he saw upon 'A'.

65On 6 April 2008, Senior Constable Hickson interviewed Ms X. Ms X had said in evidence that she was not sure if she had told Senior Constable Hickson about the physical demonstration which 'B' had given. She had seen and signed the police notebook, but was not sure if that particular piece of information was contained in it. She said that Senior Constable Hickson did not write down everything that she said. She said he only wrote brief notes. She said that she was not thinking in terms of him making a written record of what she had told him and she did not know what was important for the court to know: (T 17 June 2010, pp 24-25).

66Senior Constable Hickson said that it was possible that there were things that Ms X had told him that he did not write down. However, if she had told him that 'B' had made a physical demonstration of the kind described by Ms X in evidence, then he would have recorded it. He was confident that it was not said to him in that conversation: (T 21 June 2010 at p 6.25-35)

67For various reasons, he did not attempt to take a formal statement at that time and did not then go into specifics.

68'B's' account in his police interview was that he had told his mother that they were doing ""sexual stuff"". He went on to explain the game of dares he said he played with the appellant. He said that he could not remember what he had told his mother about 'A'. In evidence he agreed that he had told his mother that he had seen the appellant ""shanking"" 'A'. 'B' was not cross-examined about whether he ever physically demonstrated to his mother what he meant by ""shanking"".

69'A''s evidence, as given in the police interview, described activities he attributed to the appellant ""playing dares with us ..."" and describing particular activities.

70In the submissions made during the trial in support of the s 165 application, set out in para [59] above, the Trial Advocate argued that the account given by Ms X by way of complaint evidence was corroborated by what 'B' said in his answers to questions as to what he said he saw the appellant doing to 'A'.

71On the following day, 22 June 2010, counsel for the appellant provided a draft ""s 165 direction"". The draft warning sought a direction: ""even honest witnesses can be mistaken and human memory can be distorted"". The draft notice dealt with two areas: 

(i) The delay (discussed above)

(ii) The fact that ""the detail of the conversation Ms X says she had with [A] and [B] is not specifically acknowledged by [A] and [B] as accurate"".

72The trial judge indicated in further discussion about the matter that he would deal with it in the course of his directions but would not make a s 165 warning (T 22 June 2010 at p 6.6).

73In the course of the summing up on 22 June 2010, the trial judge summarised the evidence as to the evidence given by the complainants, 'A' and 'B', following which he told the jury:

""It is for you to decide whether these complaints were made. But if you are satisfied that they were then the question you should ask yourself is did the complainant, whether it be [A] or [B], act in the way that you would expect him to act if he had been sexually or indecently assaulted as he says he was? Is what he did the sort of conduct you would expect of a person in his position at the time? ..."" (p 10)

74In the course of the summing up the trial judge referred to the Crown case which, inter alia, was that the complainants had given accounts to their mother in a way and in circumstances that were consistent with ""... an honest rendition given by both of the boys to their mother of this having occurred ..."". A comment was made in the Crown submission to the effect that what 'B' had told his mother came by way of a spontaneous remark by him.

75The trial judge observed that the Crown did not resile from the fact that there was a ""fraught background"" involving clear hostility from Ms X towards the accused and that there had been Family Law proceedings and orders made for the custody of the children to be given to their father. His Honour then stated:

""... the Crown says true enough it is within that background but nonetheless you would accept [Ms X's] evidence of the complaints that she says were made to her by each of the boys, albeit in [A's] case progressively."" (Summing Up at p 19)

76The trial judge reminded the jury of the Crown's submissions including the submission that ""you would accept the evidence of Ms X as to the nature of the complaint and the statements of complaint made by each of the boys to her"": (Summing Up at p 20).

77The trial judge summed up the arguments put on behalf of the appellant including the proposition that ""the boys are lying"": (Summing Up at p 21). In the end the jury was reminded that it was not for the accused to prove that the boys were lying but for the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. 

78The trial judge also stated in the course of his summing up:

""Similarly in relation to [Ms X's] evidence, you will recall what she said to you. [Ms X] was adamant about the accuracy of her recollection of the events of 6 April where she says she was told certain things, even though she made no notes about what she had been told at the time and it was two months ... after the events that she reduced it to a statement. She was adamant that in fact she had made no mistakes at all and that she had accurately recorded in that statement what she had been told and what she saw on 6 April."" (Summing Up at p 28)

79The summing up also referred to the evidence given by Ms X including the fact that 'B' had given a physical demonstration of what he said he saw. Reference was also made to the evidence of Senior Constable Hickson to which I have referred earlier.

80The trial judge then referred in some detail to the submissions made on behalf of the appellant in which the accuracy of the account as to what the complainants had said to Ms X was challenged. It was submitted that there were irreconcilable differences in the evidence which pointed ""... to the unreliability of the evidence of Ms X"": (Summing Up at p 29). 

81Finally, the trial judge summarised the submission for the appellant to the effect that the complainants had:

""... decided to make up a story about their father and the reason why you would have your doubts in relation to these cases, brought by the Crown, is that there is evidence that would suggest that that is the case? In other words it was concocted in broad outline"": (Summing Up at p 30).

82The trial judge instructed the jury that it was a matter for the jury to determine whether they were satisfied that the complaint (being a reference to 'B''s account to Ms X) was made in accordance with Ms X's evidence.

Decision

83In determining whether there is a basis for the contention that there was a failure to give a warning under s 165, it is necessary to have regard to the circumstances in which a warning under that provision may be required. In R v Baartman [2000] NSWCCA 298, Kirby J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Smart AJ agreed) stated that s 165(1) is not an ""exclusive code"" and that the opening words of the section made it clear that the circumstances in which evidence may be unreliable extend beyond the classes of evidence identified in subparagraphs (a) to (g) of that section. His Honour then in determining whether error had occurred in that case in the trial judge declining to give a warning, stated:

""62 In the nature of things, evidence given by all witnesses may be unreliable. Evidence is necessarily dependent upon observation and recollection. Both are fallible. However, s 165 is not dealing with unreliability in this sense. Rather, the need for a warning typically arises either because the jury needs to be acquainted with the accumulated experience of courts in dealing with certain types of evidence or because there is the danger that the jury may overestimate the probative value of certain evidence.""

84The evidence of complaint, not being specifically dealt with by the provisions of s 165(1) requires identification of specific matters which would indicate that a warning under s 165 was required.

85In Baartman, two matters were identified. Firstly, that a witness' evidence was said to be unreliable, such that there was a need for a specific warning (in that case the witness had acknowledged a fear that he may be charged with having concealed a serious offence and that he provided information in the context of that fear). Secondly, that there was a delay in that witness coming forward. The conversations that he recounted took place on 23 February 1993. He came forward in June 1993. 

86In relation to these two matters, it was observed:

""67 However, I believe both matters would have been obvious to a jury. His Honour, as you would expect, provided general guidance to the jury as to the way in which it should assess the evidence given by witnesses. His directions included the following ...""

87As indicated in Baartman, the question as to whether a s 165 direction should be given where evidence does not fall within s 165(1)(a) to (g) raises questions of judgment and that on such questions reasonable minds may differ. Kirby J observed at [69]:

""... an appellate court should only intervene where a warning was plainly necessary. It will be necessary where the danger of acting upon the evidence is real and substantial, and unlikely to have been fully perceived by the jury in the absence of a warning.""

88It is clear, as earlier indicated, that the issue of the reliability of the complainants and of Ms X, was directly in issue, the defence case being that the complaints were a concoction. In those circumstances the jury could not have been under any misunderstanding as to the fact that the reliability of both the complainants and Ms X was at the centre of the concoction allegation upon which the defence was founded.

89I do not consider that either separately or in combination, the three bases upon which a s 165 warning was sought, required a direction to be given. I am of the view that the trial judge had a strong foundation for refusing to issue such a direction and was correct in refusing it. The submissions made on behalf of the appellant contended that cross-examination and submissions of defence counsel could not be equated with the ""judicial imprimatur"" provided by a warning in a summing up. It was submitted that in the circumstances of the trial ""... the complaint evidence became rather confusing especially when one tried to contrast it with the allegations made by the complainants in their evidence in chief as constituted by the various interviews"".

90However, any confusion that may have existed in the complaint evidence was a matter that would be expected to be taken up in cross-examination with a view to exposing any unreliability in the evidence given by the complainants and/or Ms X.

91The matters raised in submissions for the appellant, do not constitute grounds for a warning to be given expressed as based on the accumulated experience of the courts in dealing with certain types of evidence. The defence case was based upon a direct challenge to the reliability, in particular, the credibility of Ms X and the accounts given by the complainants, and the defence case identified specific matters (eg, the alleged animosity of Ms X towards the appellant) said to demonstrate the claimed unreliability of Ms X and the complainants. The directions of the trial judge left the jury with no doubt as to the credibility issues that required their careful consideration. Those issues involved disputed issues of fact. These were conventional matters for the tribunal of fact (the jury) to resolve.

92I am of the opinion that Ground 2 should be dismissed.

93The appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed. The order I propose accordingly is that the appeal be dismissed.

94CAMPBELL J: I agree with Hall J.

2761407,A reference by the Attorney General for the State of New South Wales under s 77(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 re the conviction of Frederick Lincoln McDermott [2013] NSWCCA 102,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: In 1936 Mr William Henry Lavers (""Mr Lavers"") and his family occupied a store and attached home alongside the road which linked Grenfell to Forbes. The house and store were approximately 12 miles north of Grenfell and 30 miles south of Forbes. Having regard to the time that the events the subject of this application took place, I will use Imperial measurements.

2On 5 September 1936 Mr Lavers went out of the store telling his wife he was going to feed his horses. He was never seen alive again.

3About an hour after Mr Lavers left the store his wife went outside to find him. She saw that the petrol hose for one of the bowsers at the front of the store was on the ground, there was a sprinkling of blood on the cement base of the bowser and some blood and matted hair on its side. On the ground just out from the bowser there was a stick which had a noticeable smell of petrol. Alongside the bowser there were fresh diamond pattern tyre tracks. Police followed the tracks back towards Grenfell where they turned off the Forbes Road and into the Marsden Road and then on to a reserve where they appeared to have stopped. A small fire had been made at the reserve. The tracks led off the reserve again and on in the direction of Forbes. The tracks near the store were very distinct and were followed north up the road to a turnoff within three miles of Forbes.

4On 10 October 1946 an itinerant shearer, Frederick Lincoln McDermott (""Mr McDermott"") was arrested and charged with the murder of Mr Lavers. Following a trial by jury he was convicted on 26 February 1947 and sentenced to death. Two appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal were unsuccessful, the High Court refusing leave to appeal from the second one: R v McDermott (No 1) (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 379; R v McDermott (No 2) (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 407; McDermott v R [1948] HCA 23; (1948) 76 CLR 501.

5The death sentence imposed on Mr McDermott was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment.

6On 14 August 1951, a Royal Commission was established to inquire into the conviction. On 9 January 1952, the Royal Commission found that there was a strong probability that the jury was misled by incorrect evidence on a matter of importance and recommended that Mr McDermott be released from further imprisonment. Mr McDermott was released on 11 January 1952. He died on 17 August 1977.

7On 11 November 2004 a farmer, Edward Markham, found a human skull on his property at Birangan Hill, Bald Hills Road, approximately 12 miles north of Grenfell. The police who attended the site also found human remains in the vicinity of those found by Mr Markham. The majority of the remains found by police were in a cave about 120 metres up Birangan Hill from where Mr Markham found the human skull. The remains were identified as those of Mr Lavers.

8A Coronial Inquiry was subsequently held in which the Deputy State Coroner found that the remains were those of Mr Lavers, returned an open finding as to the manner and cause of death, and stated that the evidence placed the conviction of Mr McDermott as being a gross miscarriage of justice. The Deputy State Coroner subsequently wrote to the Attorney General and suggested that he consider making an application on behalf of Mr McDermott for a pardon.

9On 12 July 2010 Ms Betty Sheelah, Mr McDermott's second cousin, wrote to the Attorney General seeking a pardon for Mr McDermott.

10On 26 November 2010 the Attorney General referred the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The reference was made under s 77(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""the Act""). It was common ground that the obligation of the Court under such a reference is to consider the whole case uninhibited by the way it had previously been dealt with. Although some assistance may be derived from the manner an appellate court has previously dealt with some of the issues, this does not relieve the Court of its statutory duty to consider the whole case: Mallard v The Queen [2005] HCA 68; (2005) 224 CLR 125 at [10]; Mickelberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35; (1989) 167 CLR 259 at 312.

11The appeal was heard on 28 November 2012. On the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, the Court made an order quashing the conviction of Mr McDermott. These are my reasons for joining in that order.

Jurisdiction and parties

12The parties made a joint submission that the Court had jurisdiction to deal with the matter notwithstanding the fact that Mr McDermott had died.

13The relevant sections of the Act are ss 76, 77 and 86. These sections provide as follows:

""76 A petition for a review of a conviction or sentence or the exercise of the Governor's pardoning power may be made to the Governor by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.

77(1) After the consideration of a petition: 

(a) the Governor may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b) the Minister may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, or

(c) the Minister may request the Court of Criminal Appeal to give an opinion on any point arising in the case.

(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3) The Governor or the Minister may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with a petition. Without limiting the foregoing, the Governor or the Minister may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with a petition if: 

(a) it appears that the matter: 

(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b) the Governor or the Minister is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

(3A) The Governor or the Minister may defer consideration of a petition if:

(a) the time within which an appeal may be made against the conviction or sentence (including an application for leave to appeal) is yet to expire, or

(b) the conviction or sentence is the subject of appeal proceedings (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) that are yet to be finally determined, or

(c) the petition fails to disclose sufficient information to enable the conviction or sentence to be properly considered.

(4) The Minister must cause a report to be given to the registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court as to any action taken by the Governor or the Minister under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with a petition).

(5) A petition (however described) that does not expressly seek a review of a conviction or sentence or the exercise of the Governor's pardoning power may be dealt with as if it did if the Minister is of the opinion that it should be so dealt with.

...

86 On receiving a reference under section 77(1)(b) or 79(1)(b), the Court is to deal with the case so referred in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed against the conviction or sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and that Act applies accordingly.""

14Equivalent provisions were originally contained in Pt VI of the Criminal Appeal Act. That Part was repealed and replaced by s 474B and s 474C of the Crimes Act 1900, which were in turn repealed in 2006 and inserted into the Act. 

15There are a number of matters which should be noted. First, a petition to the Governor under s 76 may be made by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person. In this case the relevant application was, of course, made by Ms Sheelah on behalf of Mr McDermott. There is no reason from the text of the legislation why such an application cannot be made on behalf of a deceased person.

16Second, s 77(1)(b) of the Act empowers the Minister to refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal. There is no requirement for a Notice of Appeal to be lodged or, for that matter, any action to be taken by the convicted person. As Spigelman CJ said in R v Doyle [2001] NSWCCA 252; (2001) 123 A Crim R 151 at [62]-[63] in respect of equivalent provisions in the Crimes Act, s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act which confers a right of appeal on a person convicted on indictment, effectively is bypassed. Thus, a reference under the equivalent of s 77(1)(b) of the Act in that case both empowered and required the Court of Criminal Appeal under the s 86 equivalent to deal with the matter on appeal, notwithstanding the fact that it was a summary conviction to which the appeal rights conferred by s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act would not apply. See also R v Johns [1999] NSWCCA 206; (1999) 110 A Crim R 149 at [5]; R v Pederick (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 21 May 1997) per Hunt CJ at CL; Re Application of Pearson [1999] NSWSC 143; (1999) 46 NSWLR 148 at 157.

17It is clear that at common law a convicted person's right of appeal against conviction and penalty abates on death, with the possible exception of the case where the relevant penalty is a fine for which the estate of the deceased convicted person is liable: R v Rowe [1955] 1 QB 573 at 575; R v Jefferies [1969] 1 QB 120 at 124. Indeed, in the latter case Widgery LJ (as he then was) stated that whatever the position at common law, the right of the legal personal representative of a deceased convicted person to continue to prosecute an appeal where the relevant penalty was a fine depended on the terms of the statute giving a right of appeal. It is not necessary to consider whether s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act confers such a right on the legal personal representative of the convicted person.

18In Sen v The Queen (1991) 30 FCR 173, the appellant lodged an appeal against his conviction for murder but died before the appeal was heard. The relevant provision giving rise to the right to appeal (s 24(1)(b) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)) was silent as to the fate of the appeal in these circumstances. The Full Court of the Federal Court following R v Rowe supra and R v Jefferies supra held that the right of appeal conferred by the statute abated on the death of the appellant: Sen supra at 175. However, the Court indicated that s 475 of the Crimes Act (the predecessor to s 77 of the Act) might well provide a means by which the correctness of such a conviction may be examined and afford a means by which a deceased family may have the correctness of a conviction considered: Sen supra at 176.

19In R v Rimon [2003] VSCA 136; (2003) 6 VR 553 the Court of Appeal in Victoria reached a similar conclusion to that in Sen supra. However, once again the Court adverted to the possibility that an application under the Victorian equivalent of s 77 of the Act could provide a means of reviewing the conviction: R v Rimon supra at 554.

20It is clear that the question of whether a reference to the Court of Criminal Appeal under s 77(1)(b) of the Act and the power of that Court to hear the appeal under s 86, notwithstanding the death of the convicted person, depends upon the construction of those provisions of the Act: Stephenson v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1996) 68 FCR 290 at 296-297; Managing Director NSW Technical and Further Education Commission v Fines (1993) 32 NSWLR 385 at 388. In the latter case Mahoney JA pointed out that there was no general or presumptive rule which would determine the matter. 

21In the present case, it seems to me that as a matter of construction the Act both empowers the Minister to refer the conviction of a deceased person to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and requires the Court to determine that appeal notwithstanding the death of the convicted person.

22This is for these reasons. First, unlike an appeal brought under s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act, the convicted person does not have to take any steps to prosecute the appeal. The Minister's power under s 77(1)(b) of the Act to refer the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal is activated on consideration of a petition under s 76. As I indicated earlier, such a petition can be brought by another person on behalf of the convicted person. Second, s 86 of the Act requires the Court to deal with the case in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed (emphasis added). The words ""as if"", in my opinion, indicate that the Court is to treat the appeal as one properly brought and which it had power to deal with under s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act. There is no question in those circumstances of any right of the convicted person abating; it is the Minister who has the power to instigate the process and once instigated the Court is required to determine the appeal.

23Such a construction seems to me to be consistent with the purpose of the provisions. That purpose, in my opinion, is to remedy injustices which cannot be remedied by the use of the normal appellate process. The fact that a wrongly convicted person has died does not mean an injustice has not occurred. There is no reason to limit the words of s 77 and s 86 so as to prevent a remedy in the case of such injustice.

24The conclusion to which I have come is consistent with that reached by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in R v Maguire [1992] QB 936 at 941, 946-947. A similar approach to the Victorian equivalent of the section was taken in dicta by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Re Ross [2007] VSC 572; (2007) 19 VR 272 at [89]. It is also consistent with the comments made on equivalent sections in Sen supra and R v Rimon supra to which I have earlier referred.

25It follows in those circumstances this Court had jurisdiction to hear the application.

26So far as the question of parties are concerned, I agree for the reasons set out in the joint submission that it is appropriate for the Attorney General to represent the Crown in the reference under s 86. However, I am not sure that it is appropriate that Mr McDermott should have been named as the appellant. Rather, it seems to me that the appropriate course would have been to simply refer to the matter as an application under s 77(1)(b) of the Act re the conviction of Frederick Lincoln McDermott and to have granted the petitioner and the Attorney General leave to appear on the hearing under s 86. However, it does not seem to me necessary to take any steps to amend the Notice of Appeal and other court documents at this stage.

The trial

27The Crown case at the trial was based primarily on four matters. First, identifying the car whose tyre tracks were observed as an Essex Tourer, about a 1924 model, belonging to a Mr Jack Parker. There was evidence that the car was used by Mr McDermott and a friend Mr Geoffrey McKay. It was alleged that they murdered Mr Lavers while using the car. Second, evidence which identified Mr McDermott using the car at about the time the murder was said to have taken place. Third, reliance was placed on what was said to be confessions made by Mr McDermott. Finally, the Crown demonstrated that a statement made by Mr McDermott that on 4 and 5 September 1936 he was shearing at a property about four miles outside of Forbes for which he was paid by cheque was incorrect. It is necessary to deal in more detail with each part of the case as outlined.

(a) The car

28Late in the afternoon of 4 September 1936 two fencers, a Mr Alfred Coble and a Mr Benjamin Berry, were working on a property about 19 miles from Grenfell when they saw a car travelling from Forbes towards Grenfell. Mr Coble described the car as very noisy and a faded blue or grey colour. Mr Berry described it as an old bluish grey touring car making an unusual noise. Each of them gave evidence that a little before sunrise on the next day they saw the same car travelling back towards Forbes.

29Mr Henry Masterson was a share-farmer on a property about 12 miles out from Forbes. He said that a little after 6.15am on the morning of 5 September 1936 he saw an old grey tourer stopped on the side of the road. A man with a black billycan looked at the radiator and then went to a nearby creek. Mr Masterson kept working on his tractor and when he looked again the car was about three-quarters of a mile away travelling fairly fast.

30Mr William Whillis, Mr Lavers' brother in law, gave evidence that just on 6.00am on 5 September 1936 he heard a very noisy car coming from Grenfell. He watched it to within 200 yards of Mr Lavers' store. He said the noise seemed to die away at the store.

31Mr Walter Hancock was a farmer who worked 15 miles north of Mr Lavers' store. He said that some time after 6.20am he saw a car he described as a very noisy old model tourer which looked to be light coloured travelling towards Forbes.

32Mrs Phoebe Priddle, whose husband owned the property opposite Mr Lavers' store, stated she heard a car starting up at the store with a lot of noise and then proceeding into the distance. She placed the time as some time before 6.20am. A Mr Stanley Ray said he was loading gravel at around 6.00am when he heard a car travelling fast towards Forbes. Three other witnesses who respectively lived and worked at properties to the south of the store, that is between the store and Grenfell, heard but did not see a car travelling towards Forbes at around the same time.

33Mr Parker said he had an Essex Tourer which he thought he had bought in 1935. He said it was about a 1924 model. He said he drove it on occasions with Mr McDermott and Mr McKay. The car was traced and some of its parts were tendered at the trial. Mr Coble said the parts in Court were similar to the colour of the car he had seen. Mr Berry said that it was a long time ago but it seemed to resemble the car in shape and colour. It was the Crown case that the car, which had made the tracks leading to and from the store on the morning of 5 September 1936, was Mr Parker's car.

(b) The identification of Mr McDermott

34A Mr Thomas Kelly ran a garage in Forbes. He gave evidence that around the time of Mr Lavers' disappearance he sold petrol to an old grey tourer with a birdcage on the side and the driver dipped the tank with a piece of redwood quadrant. He said it was similar to the stick found on the ground near the petrol bowser at Mr Lavers' store on the morning of 5 September 1936.

35Critical to the Crown case was the evidence of Mrs Essie May King, a travelling phrenologist and psychologist, who worked under the name Madame Cleo (phrenology is a pseudo science based on the theory that mental powers are indicated by the shape of the skull). Mrs King said she had a stall at the Parkes Show in late August and on 4 September 1936 she was travelling with her husband from Parkes to Wyalong along the Forbes/Grenfell Road. About mid-morning she said she saw a car on the side of the road with two men standing beside it. The men stopped the Kings and asked if they could spare any petrol. They said no. She identified the car as a very old model with a bluey-grey body. Shown parts of the car at the trial she said that it looked like the back of the car she saw.

36Mrs King gave evidence that they drove on, the car passed them and about ten or twelve miles further on they again came upon it standing at the side of the road. She said one of the men had a billycan. As the Kings passed the stationary car she said she looked back and saw the man going to the waterhole. She said the man with the billycan appeared to be the man in the dock. Her evidence was as follows:

""Q Have you seen since then one or both of these men?

A I have seen one of them.

Q Where did you next see him?

A At the Grenfell lower court.

Q Can you see him here?

A Yes, that is the man in the dock.""

37She subsequently gave evidence that she had been shown some photographs by police the year before and helped identify two men. The photographs were called for and Mrs King gave evidence that one of the two produced was not that which was originally shown to her.

38Two days after Mrs King had given evidence, Detective Sergeant Calman, one of the investigating officers who had interviewed Mrs King, stated the two photographs that she had identified were those of Mr McDermott and Mr McKay. The photograph of Mr McDermott was small, taken nine years after the event in question and Mrs King gave evidence at the committal hearing that, in contrast to the photograph, when she saw him in September 1936 he was wearing a hat.

39Whether that evidence should have been put before the jury was a matter of debate between the parties to these proceedings. However, the trial judge carefully directed the jury on this issue. He warned that the photograph was taken when Mr McDermott was a lot older than when Mrs King had seen him, that Mrs King had not seen him before, and that she had not seen him between her observation of him on the road and the time she saw the photographs. He also indicated to the jury that they should take very careful heed of Mr McDermott's counsel's warning concerning the dangers of the identification evidence.

40Mr King did not identify either man but otherwise confirmed Mrs King's account. He was shown the car parts and said that the back was the part of the car he saw and the parts looked very familiar.

41The prosecution's case was that Mr and Mrs King and Mr Kelly had seen the same old grey tourer with a birdcage, and further, the piece of redwood quadrant that Mr Kelly had seen used as a dipstick was the piece of wood with a noticeable smell of petrol found near the bowser outside Mr Lavers' store. The car was said to be the one with the distinctive diamond pattern tracks going past the store towards Grenfell on 4 September 1936 and coming back the next morning when the piece of redwood quadrant had been dropped. The car was said to be Mr Parker's car and Mr McDermott and Mr McKay were said to be the occupants.

(c) The confessional evidence

42Mr McDermott had a companion named Florrie Hampton. A drover, Mr George Holland, gave evidence that about two and a half years before the trial Ms Hampton began to abuse him violently after a conversation about a horse he had traded to Mr McDermott. Mr McDermott tried to stop her and a conversation to the following effect took place:

""He said 'Shut up'. She said 'You are only a damn murderer'. She said 'You are a damn murderer, you murdered Lavers, you murdered Lavers'. He said 'I did not'. He said 'I'm not the main one, Scotty hit him first and I hit him with the handle'. She said to him 'And you put him in the truck and drove him to a reserve and cut the poor devil up with an axe didn't you?' She said 'You cut him up with an axe'. He said 'I didn't, it was we not I'. She said 'You drove him to the sheep yards in Grenfell and buried him in the corner of the sheep yards at Grenfell'.""

Mr Holland said that both Mr McDermott and Ms Hampton were very drunk at the time.

43Mr Holland reported this conversation to the police. Some time later when he was in a shop in Griffith, Mr McDermott said to him ""you want to tell the bloody police more next time"". Mr Holland replied ""You want to watch your tongue"" and Mr McDermott said, ""Go on, get away, I don't want to bloody well talk to you"". 

44A Ms Doretta Williams gave evidence that two years prior to the trial she was camped at a farm near Griffith when there was a quarrel between Mr McDermott and Ms Hampton in which the following words were spoken:

Ms Hampton: ""You killed Lavers for seven gallons of petrol. And put his body in the car and drove out to the old Grenfell sheepyards, cut it up with an axe and buried it.""

Mr McDermott: ""Yes, of course I killed Lavers for seven gallons of petrol, put his body in the back of the car, drove out to the old Grenfell sheepyards, cut his body up with an axe and buried it.""

45Mr McDermott was interviewed by Detective Inspector Allmond, Detective Sergeant Calman and Detective Sergeant Humphris on 13 December 1944. Detective Sergeant Humphris gave the following evidence of this interview:

""Calman said 'Do you know a man named George Holland?' The accused said 'Yes'. Calman said 'He has informed the Police that he heard you say that you and another man killed Lavers and disposed of the body'. The accused said 'I told Florrie I was questioned by the Police at Bathurst about the Lavers case; she has told people that I killed Lavers for a drop of petrol'. I said 'Were you questioned by the police at Bathurst?' He said 'No, but McKay was'.""

46Mr McDermott was again interviewed by Detective Sergeant Calman on 10 October 1946. A Detective Constable May gave evidence that during the course of the interview the following exchange took place:

""Calman: Did you say to Florrie in Samuels' presence at any time that you were at Grenfell when Lavers was killed, and use the words 'I will do you in the same as I done the other fellow?'

McDermott: I suppose I did.

Calman: Do you know a woman named Doretta Williams?

McDermott: Yes.

Calman: Are you on good terms with her?

McDermott: Yes.

Calman: Did she visit you and Florrie at Griffith after tea one Sunday night when you were both living at an Italian's place where you were working the garden and Florrie was cooking?

McDermott: Yes, that is right, she came there one night.

Calman: Whilst she was there, did you and Florrie have a quarrel and did Florrie said to you 'You killed Lavers, cut his body up and buried it in some sheep yards?'

McDermott: Yes, she was always saying it to me.

Calman: Did you then say 'I killed Lavers for two gallons of petrol, we had no money to pay for the petrol so I hit him on the head with the crank handle and we put him in the car, and drove out of Grenfell to the sheep yards and buried him there?'

McDermott: Yes, that's what comes of saying too much, if I had not said that I would not be in this trouble.

Calman: Is it true that you said in Holland's presence that you killed Lavers?

McDermott: Yes, but if Florrie had kept her mouth shut I would not be here now. Have you seen McKay?

Calman: Yes.

McDermott: Did he say that I did it?

Calman: No, he didn't say that. If you were concerned in the murder of Lavers as you have said, will you tell us what was done with the body?

McDermott: I do not want to say any more now.

Calman: Are you willing to make a further statement in writing in connection with these matters we have spoken to you about?

McDermott: No, I would rather not say any more.""

47In his statement from the dock at the trial, Mr McDermott denied killing Mr Lavers and also denied telling anybody that he had. 

(d) The alibi evidence

48Mr McDermott stated in his interview on 13 December 1944 that he was in Forbes all day on 5 September 1936. In a statement he made following that interview he said he was shearing with Mr McKay on a property just outside Forbes on 4 and 5 September 1936. He said they received two cheques dated 5 September each of ₤1 payable to J McKay and F May. A Mr Henry Tomkins, who managed a property, Eulowra, about four and a half miles out of Forbes, recognised Mr McDermott but said he had sheared on the property under the name Munro on 7 September 1936, not 5 September 1936. He initially believed the cheques were an advance.

49The cheques were located. The one to F May was dated 5 September and the one to J McKay dated 7 September.

50After initially giving evidence Mr Tomkins made further inquiries. He was recalled and said the cheque of 5 September had nothing to do with the shearing. He had found a cheque for ₤1/10/- drawn on 8 September and he said that he gave that to Mr McDermott and Mr McKay on that day. He said the two cheques of 7 September and 8 September represented payment for shearing on 7 September.

51In light of the evidence outlined above the jury found Mr McDermott guilty of the murder.

The Royal Commission

52In 1951 a Royal Commission was established to inquire into the conviction of Mr McDermott. The Commission found that the car which made the tyre tracks was not Parker's car nor could it have been an Essex Tourer. The Commissioner's conclusions were as follows:

""The fact, therefore, is now fully established which did not appear at the trial, that the car body in Court was not part of Parker's car. This is not of fundamental significance, for no witness ever said that the car at the scene of the murder was Parker's. It could have been any car of the colour and type described by Mrs. King and other witnesses. But in one respect its presence in Court may have prejudiced the accused - the witnesses who identified the colour of the car by pointing to the parts in Court, and saying the car they saw was similar, may well have impressed their evidence on the jury by the concrete definition of colour, and by reducing the colour described by Mrs. King and the witnesses who saw the car on the next morning, to the common standard of the object in Court.

...

A much more important fact has been brought to light as a result of fresh evidence. I have already mentioned that Sergeant Jardine measured the width of the track of the car near the petrol bowser and found it to be 56 inches. It now transpires that the track of the Essex car is less than that. A letter has been received and put in evidence from the manufacturer of the Essex car giving its specifications, in which is set out width of track 54 7/8 inches. ...

... 

I am satisfied by the fresh evidence that the tracks made near the petrol pump, which at the trial were accepted as having been made by the car which stopped there at the time Lavers was killed, could not have been made by an Essex car and so could not have been made by Parker's car. On the totality of the evidence now available no jury could find as a fact, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Parker's car was on the scene on the morning of the 5th September, 1936. But the jury at the trial must be assumed to have found that fact against the accused.

...

As, therefore, by the terms of my Commission I am directed to report on the whole of the facts after receiving additional evidence and to say whether in my opinion, as a result of my inquiries, the prisoner should serve his sentence or be released from further imprisonment, I have to report that in my opinion the additional evidence establishes a strong probability that the jury were misled by erroneous evidence upon a matter of importance in the trial, and that this evidence contributed to their conclusion of the prisoner's guilt. I have to report therefore that in my opinion the prisoner should be released from further imprisonment.""

53The Royal Commission also expressed strong reservations about the circumstances of the confession. However, the Commissioner emphasised that at the trial Mr McDermott had denied saying that he had killed Mr Lavers, in contrast to his evidence before the Commission in which he stated that he had said so in an argument but it was not true.

54Although the Royal Commission did not refer to it, Mr Kelly during the course of his evidence at the Commission said that after seeing Mr McDermott at the committal hearing, he was quite satisfied he was not the person he had seen in the car. It also emerged that he had given a statement to the police on 28 September 1936 describing the person he had seen in a manner inconsistent with it being Mr McDermott.

55There were two other pieces of evidence which emerged as a result of the documents produced at the Royal Commission. The first was that a Constable Grogan reported that his wife had seen a car answering the description of Mr Parker's car with a noisy engine and a birdcage in Boorowa on Sunday 6 September 1936. More importantly, on 26 September 1936 a Constable McLaughlin reported that a car answering the same description was seen at 8.00am on 5 September 1936 at Yass.

The discovery of the body

56As I indicated, Mr Lavers' body was discovered in a cave about 120 metres up Birangan Hill in November 2004. The evidence of Mr Thomas John Lavers, the son of Mr Lavers, was that whilst it may have been possible in 1936 to drive a car along Bald Hills Road and over a paddock to Birangan Hill, a car could not be driven up the Hill. More importantly, the tyre tracks from Mr Lavers' store extended to a turnoff three miles south of Forbes. There was nothing to suggest the vehicle turned off the Grenfell/Forbes Road at any time prior to that, much less at a place 12 miles or thereabouts north of Grenfell.

57A Dr Denise Donlon, a Forensic and Biological Anthropologist, examined the body. For the purpose of this appeal she provided an opinion stating that there was nothing identifiable in relation to the skull consistent with the terms of Mr McDermott's confessions, that the body of Mr Lavers was not chopped or cut up with an axe and that if it was, she would have expected to have noticed marks indicating that that had occurred.

The grounds of appeal

58The Notice of Appeal filed in the proceedings contained four grounds. Ultimately only Ground 1 was relied upon. This was in the following terms:

""1. The appellant's conviction was a miscarriage of justice in that a review of the whole of the evidence, including fresh evidence not called at the trial, as outlined below, demonstrates that he was not guilty:

(a) The car parts tendered as coming from the car owned by Jack Parker, an associate of the appellant, did not come from that car.

(b) The tyre tracks found in front of Lavers' store and leading north up the road towards Forbes were not made by Jack Parker's car.

(c) A car matching the description given by the witness Essie May King of the car she observed in which the appellant was said to be travelling on the road between Forbes and Grenfell on 4 September 1936 was seen in Yass, 97 miles south/south-east of Grenfell, at about 8.00 am on 5 September 1936.

(d) The garage proprietor Tom Kelly was quite satisfied that the appellant was not the man he had seen with an old grey tourer car with a birdcage on the side to which he had served petrol around the time of Lavers' disappearance, and the description he gave of the man did not fit the appellant's friend Geoffrey McKay.

(e) The identification of the appellant by Essie May King from a small photo nearly nine years after her observation of the person of interest was inherently unreliable.

(f) The identification of the appellant's friend Geoffrey McKay by Essie May King from a small photo nearly nine years after her observation of the person of interest was inherently unreliable.

(g) The identification of the appellant by Essie May King was contaminated by the suggestibility of his photo being one of only very few full length photos shown to her.

(h) The identification of the appellant's friend Geoffrey McKay by Essie May King was contaminated by the suggestibility of his photo being one of only very few full length photos shown to her, and by his being the only person shown wearing a hat.

(i) Lavers' body was concealed at a remote and inaccessible location some kilometres east of his store, and thus the car whose tyre tracks ran from the store directly north towards Forbes could not have been involved in his disappearance.

(j) The finding of Lavers' skeleton at a remote and inaccessible location some kilometres east of his store cannot be reconciled with the statement made by the appellant to the effect that 'Yes, of course I killed Lavers for seven gallons of petrol, put his body in the back of the car, drove out to the old Grenfell sheep yards, cut his body up with an axe and buried it'.

(k) The remoteness and inaccessibility of the location at which Lavers' skeleton was found is such that there is an overwhelming probability that those who took him there were local people who knew the area.""

Consideration

59The grounds of appeal fall into two categories. Grounds 1(a), 1(d) and 1(i)-1(k) relate to what might be described as new or fresh evidence in the sense that those expressions have been used in the cases: see, for example, Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 518-519; Lawless v The Queen [1979] HCA 49; (1979) 142 CLR 659 at 675; R v Abou-Chabake (2004) 149 A Crim R 417 at [63]. The second category, comprising Grounds 1(e)-1(h), focus on what occurred at the trial and contend that there was a miscarriage of justice by virtue of the admission and/or unreliability of the identification evidence given by Mrs King.

60In that context three preliminary matters may be noted. First, in the present case a verdict of acquittal is sought. As I am of the opinion, for the reasons set out below, that the evidence is of such cogency to demonstrate the innocence of Mr McDermott, it is immaterial whether that evidence is fresh or simply new: see Ratten supra at 518-519; R v Abou-Chabake supra at [63]. Further, even if the distinction was relevant in the present case, I am not of the view that in the circumstances of Mr McDermott's trial, which took place some ten years after the death of Mr Lavers, any of the evidence in question could have been discovered or available by the exercise of reasonable diligence.

61The second preliminary matter is this. It does not seem to me necessary having regard to the cogency of the fresh or new evidence to consider the admissibility of the photographic evidence at the trial, the adequacy of the directions made by the trial judge in relation to it, or to the extent that the jury verdict was unsafe having regard to the evidence presented to it at the trial. As the Crown pointed out, this may involve consideration of the issue by reference to the relevant principles as they existed in 1947. It would certainly need to be considered without regard to the provisions in the Evidence Act 1995 dealing with the admission of evidence that may be unfairly prejudicial to the accused. In the circumstances of the present case it seems to me both unnecessary and undesirable to undertake this task. 

62The third preliminary matter is this. Ground 1(k) speculates that the murder must have been committed by a person or persons resident in the area at the time. In the circumstances of the present case, it seems to me unnecessary to speculate in this way in determining the guilt or innocence of Mr McDermott. 

63As I indicated above, the evidence relied on by the Crown at the trial fell into four categories. The first was the contention that the murder was committed whilst Mr McDermott and McKay were using an Essex Tourer belonging to a Mr Parker. The evidence at the Royal Commission established that the car whose tyre tracks appeared outside Mr Lavers' store and on the Grenfell to Forbes Road could not have been a car of the nature of that owned by Mr Parker as the tyre tracks were inconsistent with it being such a vehicle. Further, there was evidence that a car answering the description of Mr Parker's car was seen in Yass at 8.00am on 5 September 1936.

64There was no suggestion in the evidence that Mr McDermott had the use of any vehicle other than Mr Parker's car. The evidence thus undermined a significant part of the Crown's case. It also, of course, cast doubts on the evidence of Mrs King. Even ignoring the fact that it could not have been Mr Parker's car which made the tyre tracks, the evidence of Mrs King sits uneasily with the fact that a car answering the description of Mr Parker's car was sighted at Yass on the morning of 5 September 1936.

65The reliability of any identification evidence linking Mr McDermott with the murder was further undermined by the evidence of Mr Kelly at the Royal Commission to the effect that the persons in the car to which he sold petrol around the time of Mr Lavers' disappearance (see par [34] above) did not answer the description of Mr McDermott.

66In those circumstances it would not, in my opinion, have been possible to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of Mr McDermott's guilt on the evidence relating to the car and the identification evidence. To the contrary, the fact that tyre tracks related to a car with which Mr McDermott had no apparent connection was indicative of his innocence.

67There remained however the confession. As I indicated above, the Royal Commissioner expressed strong reservations about the confession, but was unable to reject it as unreliable having regard to Mr McDermott's evidence at the trial that he never made the statements to Ms Hampton alleged by Mr Holland or Ms Williams. However, the location of the body when it was discovered in 2004 coupled with the evidence of Dr Donlon indicated the confession bore no resemblance to what in fact occurred. The body was not discovered at the old Grenfell sheep yards, nor was it cut up with an axe. There was no basis for believing that when Mr McDermott made the so-called confession, he was accurately recording what occurred.

68The remaining piece of evidence relied on by the Crown was the fact that it was established that Mr McDermott's statement that he was shearing just outside Forbes on 5 September 1936 was incorrect. However, whether or not Mr McDermott was shearing at Forbes on that day, the new and fresh evidence indicates that there was no material which on any reliable basis connected him with the murder.

69In those circumstances, it is my opinion that had the evidence been available at the trial, the only verdict to which a jury could have come was a verdict of acquittal. In those circumstances there was a significant miscarriage of justice.

70It was for these reasons I joined in the orders that the conviction of Mr McDermott be set aside and in lieu thereof a verdict of acquittal be entered.

The total effective sentence was 17 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 13 years and 3 months to date from 8 October 2009.
4To understand the structure of the sentences it is useful to arrange the sentences in the order as imposed by the sentencing judge.  That is as follows:
(1) On count 5 - 18 months from 8 October 2009;
(2) On count 1 - 5 years from 8 January 2010;
(3) On count 2 - 7 years from 8 July 2010;
(4) On count 3 and one matter on a Form 1 - a non-parole period of 7 years and 10 months from 8 July 2011 with a balance of term of 2 years 8 months;
(5) On count 4 and two matters on a Form 1 - 7 years and 10 months from 8 July 2012 with a balance of term of 2 years and 7 months;
(6) On count 6 and two matters on a Form 1 - 9 years and 6 months from 8 July 2013 with a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months. 
5The non-parole period of 13 years and 3 months equates to 159 months and approximates the statutory ratio in relation to a head sentence of 17 years and 9 months.
6The sentencing judge summarised the facts as follows:
""The offender DJM has pleaded guilty to a number of offences relating to sexual abuse of a child, the complainant, who was at the relevant time his stepdaughter.  DJM was the complainant's stepfather from when she was 5 years old to the date these offences were revealed when she was 12 and 13 years old.
The offences to which he has pleaded guilty are:
Count 1 - Disseminate child pornography 
Between 1 March 2009 and 8 October 2009 he disseminated child pornography by sending it to another person.  The facts show that during a search warrant executed at the offender's home a CD was handed over by the offender from his bedroom.  The CD contained photographic images of his stepdaughter naked.  The offender admitted taking photos contained on the disc between 1 March 2009 and 8 October 2009, in his bedroom at the Rosebery property.  The offender admitted that photographs were sent or disseminated by him to TA over MSN Messenger on the internet.
Count 2 - Use child under 14 years for pornographic purposes 
Between 1 March 2009 and 8 October 2009 used a child under 14 years, namely 13 years, for pornographic purposes.  The photographic images contained on the CD taken during the search warrant were taken by the offender.  He activated a webcam so that TA could view the victim getting naked.  At the time of this offence the complainant was 13 years old. 
Count 3 - Aggravated sexual intercourse (victim under 16 years old) 
On 3 October 2009 the offender had sexual intercourse with the complainant, who was 13 years of age, knowing she was not consenting, in circumstances of aggravation (circumstance of aggravation child under 16 years).  On 3 October 2009, following the performance of digital penetration, the offender stated that he had penile/vaginal intercourse with his stepdaughter.  The offender stated that this occurred in his bedroom at night when the other children were sleeping.  He stated that at that time he did not wear a condom and he ejaculated either on the complainant's stomach or into a tissue.  At the time of this offence the complainant was 13 years old.
Form 1  He has asked that an offence of Disseminate child pornography - s91H(2) Crimes Act between 1 December 2008 and 1 March 2009 be taken into account on this matter (max penalty 10 years).  FACTS:  Between 1 December 2008 and 1 March 2009, the offender set up a webcam on his computer.  The webcam was used to convey video of his stepdaughter naked and video of the offender performing sexual intercourse with her to PWB.  At the time of this offence the complainant was 13 years old.  This matter is associated with Count 6 and relates to the broadcasting of sexual intercourse over the internet to PWB.
Count 4 - Aggravated sexual intercourse (victim under 16 years old) 
On 6 October 2009, the offender had sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter, who was 13 years old, without her consent, knowing she was not consenting.  Following the performance of digital penetration, he had penile/vaginal intercourse with her.  The offender stated that this occurred in his bedroom at night when the other children were sleeping.  The offender did not wear a condom and he ejaculated either on the victim's stomach or into a tissue.  At the time of this offence the complainant was 13 years old.
Form 1 He has asked that a similar matter and a charge of Commit act of indecency (max penalty 5 years), relating to activity on 3 October 2009 (which were associated with the commission of the offence referred to in Count 3) also be taken into account.
Form 1 Counts
i.  Aggravated sexual assault (victim under 16 years old):  On 3 October 2009 the offender and the complainant were in his bedroom, both naked.  He digitally penetrated her vagina.  At the time of this offence the complainant was 13 years old.
ii.  Commit act of indecency with person under 16 years:  On 3 October 2009 the offender stated that while he was penetrating the complainant with his fingers and penis he was rubbing and playing with her breasts.  At the time of this offence the victim was 13 years old.  These offences are associated with the commission of Count 3. 
Count 5 - Possess child pornography 
On 8 October 2009 had in his possession child pornography naked pictures of TA's sister who at the time was 13 years old.  He also had other images of child pornography.  (Details are not included in the facts or tendered).
Count 6 - Aggravated sexual intercourse (victim under 16 years old) 
Between 1 December 2008 and 1 March 2009 the offender had sexual intercourse with the complainant, who was 13 years old, without her consent and knowing she was not consenting.  He stated that he had penile/vaginal intercourse with the victim.  At this time a webcam was set up for PWB to view him having sexual intercourse with the complainant.
Form 1  He has asked that similar matters of commit act of indecency (max penalty 5 years), offences committed on 6 October 2009, and in circumstances which are relevant to Count 4, also be taken into account.  
FACTS:  1.  On 6 October 2009, the complainant and the offender were in his bedroom, both naked.  The offender started rubbing and playing with the complainant's vagina, then digitally penetrated her vagina.  At the time of this offence the complainant was 13 years old.
2.  On 6 October 2009, the accused stated that prior to digitally penetrating the child's vagina he was rubbing and playing with her breasts.  She was 13 years old.  These offences are associated with the commission of Count 4. ""
GROUNDS OF APPEAL
Ground 1:  Her Honour erred by finding that the fact that each of the offences occurred in the complainant's home aggravated each of the sentences. 
7In passing sentence the sentencing judge said:
""Each of the offences was committed in the home of the offender, but due to the nature of the custody arrangements, it was also the home of the complainant, for the period of access.  Effectively the victim had no place have (sic) safely to escape to.  This is an aggravating circumstance.""
8The argument advanced is that this was an error because the judge must have had in mind s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides it is an aggravating factor if the offence was committed in the home of the victim.  Reference was made to authorities such as R v Comert [2004] NSWCCA 125 where it was pointed out this factor operated where a victim was assaulted in their own home by an unauthorised intruder.
9In my view the statement by the sentencing judge did not have reference to this aspect of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act at all.  In the course of her remarks, the judge noted that it was an obvious aggravating feature where the offender was in a position of trust and that the abuse of trust is considered to be more serious where the offender is the father or family member.  Her Honour quoted the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Hudson (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales, Spigelman CJ, Sully, Ireland JJ, 30 July 1998, unreported) at 3 that ""... children in a family situation are virtually helpless against sexual attack by the male parent..."" and a similar statement in R v BJW [2000] NSWCCA 60; 112 A Crim R 1 where Sheller JA at [21] referred to the fact that ""... a child aged 13 or younger is virtually helpless in the family unit when sexually abused by a step-parent.""
10The comments made by the sentencing judge that the victim had no place of safety to escape to was nothing more than a statement of the obvious in relation to these sorts of offences committed in the family home and it does not amount to an asserted double counting of the seriousness of the offence.
Ground 2:  Her Honour erred in her assessment of the personal circumstances of the applicant by finding that, ""when considering the appropriate ratio of the non-parole period to the parole period, the personal circumstances of the offender are relevant"".
11The sentencing judge did say ""... when considering the appropriate ratio of non-parole period to parole period, the personal circumstances of the offender are relevant.""  It is argued this indicates the judge ignored personal circumstances for all other purposes.  However, the sentencing judge did refer appropriately to the personal circumstances of the applicant including his prospects of rehabilitation, the question of remorse and the psychiatric material tendered on his behalf.  It cannot be said his personal circumstances were considered only in a limited way.  In my view this ground of appeal should be dismissed. 
Ground 3:  Her Honour erred by failing to give proper effect to her finding of ""special circumstances"".
12In her judgment on sentence her Honour said:
""There will be consideration given to the need for an extended period of supervision as part of the sentence.  Mr Watson-Munro confirms that such a period of supervision will be necessary to as he puts it ""reinforce and galvanise the progress that he has made during the course of his time in prison.""  This assumes that he will make some progress by meaningful participation in appropriate in-custody programmes.  For that reason, an adjustment will be made in the Non Parole ratio for the final offences to reflect the need for supervision on his release, and that consideration ought be given to release, provided he has so participated.""
13The total of the sentences imposed was one of 17 years and 9 months consisting of a non-parole period of 13 years and 3 months and a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months.  A non-parole period representing the statutory ratio of 75% would have been 159.75 months whereas the term to be served imposed by the judge was 159 months. 
14The sentencing judge was correct in stating that the fact of accumulation of the last sentence did give rise to special circumstances and it was on that basis she varied the statutory ratio of the last sentence so that the non-parole period in respect of the total sentence approximates the statutory ratio.  The question raised is whether or not she should have varied the statutory ratio further to reduce the non-parole period.  In view of her findings as to lack of evidence of remorse and unknown prospects of rehabilitation it was open to her to take the view she did.  It can be argued he will require supervision on his release but in this case a lengthy sentence is inevitable and it will as a consequence involve a long period on parole even if a sentence is imposed reflecting the statutory ratio.
15I would dismiss this ground of appeal.
Ground 4:  Her Honour erred by failing to moderate the sentences because of the applicant's co-operation with the investigating police and because of the admissions that he made in his record of interview. 
16The applicant argues the sentencing judge should have expressly acknowledged the relevance of the applicant's confession and assistance in accordance with the decision of DBW v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 236 where it was said that a voluntary disclosure of guilt is a factor to be taken into account and given significant weight.
17The criminality of the applicant came to light because of the arrest of TA, a 26 year old who received pornographic images from the applicant and who sent such images to the applicant.  His arrest alerted the police to the activities of the applicant and as a result of a search warrant on his property, items of pornography were found.
18On the other hand, Count 1 related to a CD containing images of the victim.  This CD was handed to the police by the applicant and to that extent his co-operation facilitated the investigation.  Moreover so far as this CD is concerned there was limited material presented to the sentencing judge as to what was contained on it and I note her Honour complained of the ""deficit of detail"" in relation to some of the offences.  I do not believe this ground has significance in relation to any of the other counts but it does have relevance to Count 1. 
Ground 5:  The sentence in relation to Count 1 is manifestly excessive.
19This ground specifically raises the question of the penalty imposed on Count 1.  The maximum penalty is 10 years and a fixed term of 5 years was imposed.  A fixed term is generally taken to equate to a non-parole period and that indicates her Honour had in mind a head sentence of 80 months after allowing a discount of 25% and that means it was assessed as warranting a sentence of almost 9 years.  That sentence is excessive, bearing in mind the lack of detail available about the images and the fact the applicant volunteered the existence of the disc to the police.  The applicant agreed he had directed the child to pose naked with her legs open and her vagina spread.  It is an offence that calls for a sentence that reflects how serious the offence was but the sentence imposed went beyond what was appropriate.  I would allow the appeal on this ground and impose a fixed term of 3 years. 
Ground 6:  The sentences in relation to Counts 3, 4 and 6 are manifestly excessive.
20Counts 3 and 4 are offences involving a maximum penalty of 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.  Individually they are serious offences also involving matters on a Form 1.  The sentences imposed are significant and individually they are not excessive.  These offences involved a significant breach of trust in relation to a young girl, with multiple acts over a considerable period of time.  They call for significant punishment.  The real question at the end of the day is to what extent these sentences should be accumulated on the other sentences imposed and that is a question to be addressed in the last two grounds.
21In relation to Counts 1 to 5 her Honour allowed a discount of 25% for the plea of guilty.  On Count 6 a discount of 12½ percent was applied because of a late plea and that indicates a starting point of 16 years.  On Counts 3 and 4 the starting point was 14 years discounted by 25%.  That gives rise to the question as to what justifies the distinction.  The three counts involved the same conduct with matters on a Form 1 to be taken into account.  The complainant was 13 years old at the time of all the offences.  The matters taken into account in respect of Counts 3 and 4 were arguably more serious.  I do not believe a distinction is justified other than the discount for the plea of guilty and the fact the sentence is to be cumulative on the other sentences. 
22Otherwise, the sentences on Counts 3 and 4 were appropriate sentences but I propose the sentence imposed on Count 6 be set aside and another sentence imposed. 
Ground 7:  Her Honour erred by failing to have sufficient regard to the principle of totality.
23It is further argued the judge had insufficient regard to the principle of totality, particularly since all the offences were part of an extended course of conduct.  The principle relating to totality was explained in Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616 where at [18] the Court considered Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 106 CLR 59 and said:
""In Mill (supra), Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ adopted a statement from Thomas, Principles of Sentencing, 2nd ed (1979) at 56-57:
""The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate is ""just and appropriate"".  The principle has been stated many times in various forms:  ""when a number of offences are being dealt with and specific punishments in respect of them are being totted up to make a total, it is always necessary for the court to take a last look at the total just to see whether it looks wrong [""]; ""when ... cases of multiplicity of offences come before the court, the court must not content itself by doing the arithmetic and passing the sentence which the arithmetic produces.  It must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences"".'""
24The Court went on to say at [26]:
""The first matter to be noticed in this regard is that the joint judgment in Pearce recognizes the currency of Mill by referring to the principle of totality which it reiterates (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 [45] per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ.  The joint judgment in Mill expresses a preference for what should be regarded as the orthodox, but not necessarily immutable, practice of fixing a sentence for each offence and aggregating them before taking the next step of determining concurrency.  Pearce does not decree that a sentencing judge may never lower each sentence and then aggregate them for determining the time to be served.  To do that, is not to do what the joint judgment in Pearce holds to be undesirable, that is, to have regard only to the total effective sentence to be imposed on an offender.  The preferable course will usually be the one which both cases commend but neither absolutely commands.  Judges of first instance should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing is effected.  The trial judge here did not offend any of the principles stated in Mill or Pearce.  His only error may have been to fail to state starting and ending dates, but this was neither to apply a uniquely Western Australian principle, nor otherwise to make an appealable error.  What his Honour intended was obvious enough and did not fail in substance to give effect to the Act.""
25The sentencing judge gave careful consideration to each of the sentences and she was conscious of the need to fix the last sentence in such a way as to achieve a balance in respect of the whole sentence.  For the reasons given there is a need to review the sentences on Counts 1 and 6 and in that sense to review the total sentence but apart from that I do not believe her Honour departed from the sentencing principles as expressed in Johnson v The Queen (supra).  I would reject this ground of appeal. 
Ground 8:  The total effective sentence is manifestly excessive.
26For the reasons given in respect of Counts 1 and 6, I believe the total sentence is manifestly excessive and I would allow this ground of appeal to that extent. 
27In order to achieve the necessary balance between the head sentence and the non-parole period and taking into account the principle of totality, I propose the following orders:
(1) Leave to appeal be granted.
(2) Appeal allowed.
(3) Impose sentences as follows: 
(a)On Count 5 confirm the sentence of 18 months fixed term to date from 8 October 2009;
(b)On Count 1 quash the sentence and impose a sentence of 3 years fixed term to date from 8 April 2010;
(c)On Count 2 confirm the sentence of 7 years fixed term but order the sentence to date from 8 October 2010;
(d)On Count 3 quash the sentence and taking into account the Form 1 impose a sentence of 7 years fixed term to date from 8 October 2011;
(e)On Count 4 quash the sentence and taking into account the Form 1 impose a sentence of 7 years fixed term to date from 8 April 2012; 
(f)On Count 6 quash the sentence and taking into account the Form 1 impose a sentence of 7 years non-parole period from 8 October 2012 with a balance of term of 3 years 4 months.  
The total effective sentence would be a non-parole period of 10 years with a balance of term of 3 years 4 months.  The first date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 7 October 2019.

		06 May 2013",2013-05-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761409,Filippou v R [2013] NSWCCA 92,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN JA:  The appellant was charged with and convicted of the murder of Sam Willis and his brother Luke Willis on 27 June 2010. He admitted that he had shot them on the footpath outside his home in Mayfield but pleaded to each count that he was not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter.
2The issue at the trial was provocation. It was accepted by the appellant that his acts had occasioned death in each case in circumstances which, but for the assertion that he was provoked, would have amounted to murder. He was tried by a judge sitting without a jury. Accordingly, the reasons for judgment of the trial judge can be examined by this Court.
3The appellant was sentenced on each count to a non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment with an additional term of 6 years. The trial judge provided an accumulation of 5 years and accordingly the effective sentence is a minimum of 25 years with an additional term of 6 years.
4There are three grounds of appeal although, having regard to the submissions that are made, Ground 3 has no significance. The grounds are as follows:
Ground 1: Her Honour's verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, in particular, but not exclusively, upon the following bases:(a) that, in finding that there was no reasonable possibility that the applicant had lost self control within the meaning of s 23 of the Crimes Act 1900 at the time that he fired the shots causing death, her Honour:(i) misdirected herself as to the inferences to be drawn from statements made by the applicant while in custody;(ii) drew erroneous inferences from those statements; and(iii) failed to consider alternative inferences fairly available on the evidence; and(b) that, in finding as to the circumstances of the shooting and the explanation for the gap in time between the second and third shots, her Honour:(i) failed to direct herself as to the need to consider other inferences; and(ii) failed to consider other [inferences] fairly available on the evidence.(c) that, in dealing with the 'ordinary person' test within the meaning of s 23 Crimes Act 1900 her Honour:(i) misdirected herself as to the question of proportionality;(ii) determined the  reasonable person issue on the basis of that misdirection; and (iii) applied the wrong burden of proof
Ground 2: Her Honour made the following errors of law:(a) misdirected herself as to the inferences available to be drawn from statements made by the applicant while in custody;(b) failed to direct herself with respect to such statements of the need to be satisfied that the inference proposed to be drawn is the only rational inference available;(c) failed, in that regard, to consider available alternative inferences;(d) with respect to the movements of the applicant at the time of the shooting and the sequence of shots failed to direct herself as to the need to be satisfied that the inference proposed to be drawn is the only rational available inference;(e) misdirected herself as to the role of 'proportionality' in the issue of provocation;(f) in considering the issue of the reasonable person within the meaning of s 23 Crimes Act 1900, her Honour applied the wrong onus of proof.
Ground 3: In all the circumstances the conviction of the applicant for murder amounts to a miscarriage of justice. 
The judge's reasons
5The trial judge provided an account of the factual background followed by an account of the events of the day of the shooting. In order to enable an appropriate understanding of her Honour's reasons and the criticism made of them in the appellant's submissions it is necessary to set out her Honour's factual findings.
Factual background
6The two victims, Luke and Samuel Willis, were brothers. They were aged respectively 28 years and 22 years at the time of their deaths. Their parents separated in 1995. Their father, William Willis, purchased a house at 12 Y Street Mayfield in about 2000 and the brothers lived there from time to time over the next ten years. In early 2009 the appellant purchased a house at 7 Z Street Mayfield. This property was situated directly behind the Willis' home, so that they shared a back fence. Mayfield is a suburb of Newcastle.
7Mr William Willis used to travel extensively, and was sometimes absent from the Mayfield home for extended periods. In 2009 he was away between 4 April and 20 June. Not long before his return, Sam Willis, who was then living in the Y Street house, had a party, or a drinking session, at his home one Sunday night. The revellers were sitting around an open fire in the back yard playing music very loudly. This continued well into the early hours of the next morning. It provoked a neighbour, who lived diagonally to the rear of the Willis home (and therefore next door to the appellant), to call out and ask the revellers to be quiet. The noise continued and the neighbour telephoned the police, but they did not attend. At one stage, the neighbour turned his hose onto the party-goers in the Willis back yard. Verbal abuse ensued between them. At some point the appellant came into his yard and joined in the heated exchange. All of them, including the appellant, were delivering insulting expletives. However, the trial judge concluded that the evidence indicates that it was the party-goers in the Willis home who probably used the most offensive language.
8This incident marked the beginning of the neighbourhood conflict between the Willis household and the appellant, which ultimately led to the killing of the Willis brothers.
9Sam Willis told his father about this incident shortly afterwards, when his father returned from overseas. It would appear from this account that there were only two of them in the Willis back yard that night, namely Sam himself and his close friend Alex Best. It would appear that they had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol. Alex Best gave evidence in the trial in which he described an incident in 2009 when he said that he and Sam were in the Willis back yard playing music and the neighbour directly to their rear turned a hose on them and said, ""keep the noise down or I'll come around and shoot you"". The trial judge concluded that Mr Best's description of the man who did this could only apply to the appellant.
10It would appear from the whole of the evidence that the incident described by Mr Best must be the same incident which Sam Willis told his father about. It was also described by a number of neighbours, including the wife of the appellant. The trial judge found Mr Best's evidence was clearly inaccurate in a number of respects: as to the volume of the music (he said that it was not loud); as to the timing of the event (he said that it took place at dusk); and as to which neighbour it was who turned the hose on them (it was clearly not the appellant).
11The trial judge concluded that Mr Best played a significant part in the events which ultimately escalated the neighbourhood conflict to its tragic climax. Her Honour concluded that it is not at all unlikely that he has unconsciously reconstructed events so as to minimise his own role. In any event, her Honour did not accept Mr Best's evidence that the appellant threatened to shoot them during the course of this episode. This is contrary to the evidence of the two neighbours from adjacent properties, one of whom described the appellant as saying, ""turn the music down or I'll come over there and knock your fucking head off"", and the other who described the appellant as saying, ""come over here you little cunt and I'll show you"".
12A few days after this incident a handwritten note was left at the Willis property. It was in the following terms:
""My elderly mother is sick and tired of the noise you make daily and nightly so I followed you on Friday night and Saturday. It's a nice place where your mummy lives lets see if mummy likes being disturbed like my mother has to put up with. So dopey if my mother rings me again the cops might like to know about all the dope you've hidden at 12 Y St and your mummys place.""
13According to the evidence of Matthias Zierholz, the handwriting expert called by the Crown, this letter was written by the appellant. Mr Zierholz was extensively cross-examined by Mr Moir on behalf of the appellant. However, the probity of his opinion remained, in her Honour's view, essentially undiminished. Her Honour accepted that the letter was in fact written by the appellant.
14Sam Willis was concerned about the tone of this letter and wanted to find out who had written it. For this reason, he went around the neighbourhood, with the letter in his hand, and asked the residents whether they knew anything about it. Several of the neighbours gave statements in which they described Sam's visit. Her Honour concluded from their evidence that Sam's attitude was polite and composed. He expressed concern that his music might have been disturbing the neighbours. One neighbour described him as ""apologetic and respectful"". Another said that he was ""polite ... and completely non-threatening"". His next-door neighbour, an elderly lady, described him as ""a little agitated, but always polite"". According to accounts that Sam gave afterwards, the majority of the neighbours whom he approached gave positive feedback, saying that they did not have any problem with his activities at the Y Street address. They expressed shock at the tone of the letter. The one exception was the appellant. Sam told his father that, when he went to the appellant's home and asked him if he had written the note, the appellant denied writing the note and said, ""if you come around and threaten me again I'll shoot you"". Sam told his mother that the appellant had threatened to kill him.
15The appellant himself referred to this incident in his ERISP the day after the killing. He was asked if he knew the name of one of the boys. He said:
""...first off it was Sam, he come around to our place last year going someone ripped me ... someone put some dope on the car, blab, blab, blab. Then he went round the rest of the neighbours as well.
Q 56 So there's obviously, there's obviously already tension, conflicts between you and Sam.
A: Just the noise, just the noise factor and ... yeah, how he sort of went on, you get me. Something happened, they'd come to our place, they'd go to next door, they'd go there and there but in the whole meantime they're the dickheads who are causing it all so to speak. You know, they'd come whingeing someone's done this, someone's done that.""
16A few days after the conversation between Sam Willis and the appellant, Sam's father, William Willis, spoke to the appellant over the back fence. In his statement dated 2 July 2010, Mr Willis described the conversation as follows:
""I asked him what had happened. I raised the issue of his threats towards Sam. I can't remember the exact conversation but he replied your son was really upset and angry he was really threatening me. I made a comment that it was the heat of the moment. He said 'I was upset Sam was upset we just let off a little bit of steam'. He said 'I just don't want to be threatened by Sam again'. I told him that I would talk to Sam and sort it out.""
17During Mr Willis' evidence before her Honour the Crown prosecutor asked him about this conversation. He gave the following answer:
""A. Yes, the conversation also included comment by the man which was to the effect that Sam came around with the note, which I've referred to in that paragraph, but he also said that Sam came around and Sam had - he was dressed - he didn't have a shirt on when he came around and the man said that he told Sam that, 'If you come around again, I will shoot you'.
Q.  What, if anything, did you say when the man said that to you?A.  I can't remember my exact words, but I was in a state of shock and said that, to some effect, that maybe it was just sort of a misunderstanding, that it would blow over, that it was just comments made in the heat of the moment.""
18Mr Willis was cross-examined about this conversation by counsel for the appellant. He described the tone of the appellant during this conversation as ""unemotional"". He was asked why he had omitted from his statement the important fact that the appellant acknowledged threatening to shoot his son Sam. He denied that he had forgotten this aspect of the conversation when he made his statement. Rather, he said, he thought that those words were included in the statement and only realised that they were not when he read the statement not long before giving his evidence.
19Her Honour found that Mr Willis has every reason to dislike the appellant, to put it mildly. After all, on any way of looking at it, it was the appellant who shot and killed his two sons. Nevertheless, the trial judge said that she gained the firm impression that he was trying to remain objective during the course of his evidence and to give his best recollection of events as they occurred. Her Honour found that it was clear from the appellant's answers that he resented Sam Willis approaching him and asking about the letter. Her Honour said that in all the circumstances I accept that the accused did threaten Sam Willis by saying words to the effect of ""if you come around and threaten me again I'll shoot you.""
20There were no further overt conflicts between the two households for the rest of 2009. Mr Willis Snr was in Turkey between 15 August and 17 November 2009. Before his departure he had a discussion with the appellant about the erection of a new common fence between their properties. On all accounts this was completely amicable. Also before his departure he warned Sam not to have any more loud parties and to keep the noise down during his absence.
21It would appear that Sam heeded his father's advice. After Mr Willis returned the new fence was erected between the Willis and Filippou back yards, with the complete co-operation of both the appellant and Mr Willis.
22During this time Luke Willis was living in Hay, where he was teaching at the local primary school. He had a three-year tenure there, which finished in December 2009. At that time he returned to Newcastle where he had obtained a permanent job at Thornton Primary School as a Year 6 teacher. He initially lived in the Y Street house with his father and brother, pending the purchase of his own home in E Street, Mayfield.
23Early in January 2010 a number of hypodermic syringes were scattered on the pavement immediately outside the Willis home. Mr Willis said in his statement that they used gloves to pick them all up, and they then threw them away. He said:
""We didn't approach anyone or report it to the Police, we took it as just part of living in Mayfield.""
24He was asked about this by defence counsel. He said:
""In Mayfield there can be incidences of what I call vandalism that take place, and also people dumping things around the area.""
25Later in January, on the eve of Luke's move into his new home in E Street, the three Willises, namely Luke, Sam and their father, had a barbeque at the back of the Y Street home. As Mr Willis described it, they had some beers and listened to music which was at a ""moderate level"". Luke had already left before they packed up the barbeque and went to bed, which Mr Willis said was at about 11:00 pm.
26The next day they found that the front gate of the Y Street property and a significant part of the front fence had been sprayed with a shiny grey paint. The paint had also spilled out onto the driveway and part of the pavement. They noticed a trail of paint splatters going down Y Street. They followed it and found a small empty paint tin about four houses away from the Willis home. It was apparent that this was the tin which had contained the paint sprayed onto their property.
27A few days later Mr Willis found a two-page handwritten note lying on his front lawn. It was in the following terms:
""To the noisy residents of 12 [Y]
I've lived in [Y] St for over 20 years and it is a quiet and clean area
Since you and whoever have moved in at the above address the noise and rubbish people who frequent your house is not acceptable. You show no respect for the people around a lot whom are elderly. I have spoken to a few residents near your house and not one has said anything positive about you. So if you are renting go rent some where else, if by any chance you own the home, I will personally make your stay there unbearable
I can hear your noise halfway down the street so clean your act up and show some respect or you wont be in your little house to long [sic] and no-one around here will mind at all""
28The handwriting expert called by the Crown, Mr Zierholz, was of the opinion that this letter was also written by the appellant, evidence which her Honour accepted. The trial judge remarked that both letters contained false information as to the purported author of the letter, which her Honour believed to be an attempt to deflect attention away from the appellant. The first letter referred to the author's ""elderly mother"". As already mentioned, the appellant's mother was at no time living in his house. The second letter purported to come from a long-time resident of Y Street. The appellant had never been a resident of Y Street - he lived in a street which was parallel to Y Street. Nor was he a long-term resident. He had bought the property approximately eighteen months earlier. 
29The second letter caused considerable concern to Sam Willis and his father. They decided to canvass the neighbourhood as to the authorship of the letter, and also as to whether their neighbours had continuing concerns about noise emanating from their home. This time the two of them, father and son, went together to their neighbours' homes.
30According to Mr Willis, all of the neighbours to whom they spoke said that they had no problems at all with the residents of 12 Y Street. This was confirmed by the statements of several of the neighbours who were approached. When the Willises went to the appellant's home, Mr Willis said that a female came to the door and declined to allow them to speak to her husband, who she said was asleep. Mr Willis asked her, ""are you having any problems with us, has the noise been disturbing you?"" She said: ""No. We haven't had any problems since the incident in June last year.""
31This description of the incident was essentially confirmed by the appellant's wife, Glenda Filippou, in an interview conducted by the police later on the evening of 27 June 2010. She referred to Sam Willis and his father coming around to their home saying that somebody had been spray painting their fence, saying that if this continued they would call the police.
32Mrs Filippou said:
""And I said, well don't look at me, you know. I said, as far as I'm concerned I haven't heard his music again since that night, not, you know, not to bother you anyway, you hear it but not to bother you.""
33On 9 February 2010 Mr Willis' partner arrived from Turkey and stayed with them until 11 April, when the two of them left together to go to Turkey. During that period Mr Willis said that there were no further incidents. He was still overseas when the killings took place on 27 June. In the meantime, Mr Willis said that he kept in regular contact with his sons who told him that there were no problems in the Y Street home. Only days before the killing Mr Willis used his computer to ""Skype"" with the two boys at Luke's home. They assured him that they were looking after the Y Street house and that there were no problems. Sam told his father that he was studying and working. He described himself as having a ""boring life"".
34At that stage Sam Willis was studying Environmental Science at Newcastle University. He had commenced this course in 2007, after finishing High School. The studies were interrupted after his first year when he went to Mexico where he studied Central American Art at the University of Monterrey and learnt to speak fluent Spanish. When he returned to Australia in 2009 he re-enrolled in the Environmental Science course for which, according to his mother, he was receiving distinction grades. In 2010 he was also working part-time with Allambie Youth Services where he was a team leader of a ten-year-old boy who had problems in foster care. 
1The killing of the Willis brothers took place on the evening of Sunday 27 June 2010. At that time there were two people living at 12 Y Street, namely Sam Willis and Luke's girlfriend, Monica Dorbecker Del Rio. On the afternoon of Saturday 26 June the two of them went, together with Alex Best, to a barbecue at Luke's home in E Street. There, according to Mr Best, they were drinking beers. At about 9.00 pm Mr Best and Sam left to return to the Y Street house. On the way home they stopped at a liquor store and bought a bottle of bourbon. As they were walking across the front lawn to enter the house, they found a plastic bag on the ground. Sam opened it and, according to Mr Best, found inside a mass of dried leafy material, or ""pot pourri"" as they described it, together with a piece of cardboard on which was written, in large handwriting: ""Cheers you Dope from Alex."" It is possible that this bag had been on the lawn for some little time, as Ms Dorbecker Del Rio said in her evidence that she had seen it there for something between one and two weeks. However it is apparent that this was the first time that any member of the household had opened it.
35According to Mr Best, both he and Sam were shocked by this. They were wondering how this person knew Mr Best's name. Sam said that he wanted to talk to the person responsible before things escalated even further. They had no doubt as to who was responsible, namely the person who lived in the house immediately behind them. So they decided to go to that person's home. They started walking around the block. On the way, Sam rang Luke and told him what had happened. Luke also was shocked, according to Mr Best.    However he instructed the other two not to continue on their mission, but to go home. He reminded them that the neighbour in question had young daughters, who might be disturbed. So Sam and Mr Best decided not to knock on the appellant's door. However Mr Best said that they wanted to convey to the man that they knew that he was responsible for what had been happening. So they poured the contents of the plastic bag, including the cardboard note, onto the white utility which was parked in the driveway of the appellant's house. Mr Best also used a cigarette lighter to scratch the words ""Suck me"" onto the back of the utility.
36The scratch marks on the car were very superficial. The appellant's wife, Mrs Glenda Filippou, was able to polish them off the next day.
37It was Mrs Filippou who first found the leafy material and the message on the car outside their home at about 11 o'clock the next morning, Sunday 27 June. She called the appellant, and according to what she later told the police, when the appellant saw what had happened he responded by calling out (no doubt abusively) at the back fence. However there was no response from the Willis household.
38Mrs Filippou said that her husband left their home only once that day, to go to the local TAB. This was at about midday. He was gone for a few minutes only. When he returned, he told her that he had pulled up outside 12 Y Street on his way home, but there was no one there. The appellant then remained at home until the arrival of the Willis brothers early that evening.
39Mr Zierholz was unable to determine who wrote the note saying ""Cheers you Dope from Alex"". Accordingly, her Honour identified that a factual issue arose as to whether it was written by the appellant, as implied by Mr Best's evidence, or whether it was written by Mr Best himself, and then put into the bag which the two of them poured over the appellant's car. Her Honour said that she initially thought that it was likely to be the latter. The appellant had never met Mr Best (although he had heard him over the back fence), and may well not have known his name. Indeed, he told the Police, in his ERISP, that the thing that baffled him about this episode was the name ""Alex"". He thought that the neighbour's name was ""Sam"". On the other hand, a friend of Sam's, Jordan Appleyard, described a telephone conversation with Sam on that Sunday, in which the latter told him that he and Alex had found a bag containing pot pourri in their garden the previous evening, together with a note saying ""From your mate Alex"". Her Honour believed that this was powerful evidence in support of the proposition that the appellant did indeed write the note because Mr Appleyard almost certainly had no other source of information about this matter when he made his statement to the police two days later.
40However, her Honour did not make any conclusive finding on this matter, which is essentially peripheral to the main events, which occurred some time later, on the Sunday evening.
The day of the shooting
41Sam Willis regularly worked on Sundays, between about 8.30 am and 5.00 pm. His co-worker and friend, Spencer Thebus, who took over from him that afternoon, had a conversation with him about the ""neighbourhood dispute"" that the Willises were involved in. Sam told him about the letters they had received, the paint being splashed on the fence, and the bag of pot pourri. He said that he knew who had been doing this, namely the older man who lived behind them. Mr Thebus said in his statement that although the two of them were laughing about these incidents, he could see that Sam was concerned.
42After Sam left work that afternoon, he went to Luke's home in E Street. He was described by the people who shared the house with Luke as being ""a bit down"" and ""a bit subdued"". He did not stay long, and left at about 5.30 pm. It would appear that Luke left at much the same time. The evidence indicates that they both must have gone immediately to the Y Street home.
43What happened then comes from the evidence of Ms Dorbecker del Rio. She had been out with friends for much of that day, and arrived back at the Y Street house at about 5.50 pm. Both Luke and Sam Willis were standing outside. They told her that the lounge room window had been broken. She looked over and saw that a plastic bag with a book or books had been thrown through the window, and was lying on the couch immediately below the window. Luke and Sam told her that they were going to talk to the neighbour who was responsible, pointing to the rear of the house. They then left, with Sam saying ""Don't touch anything from the broken window."" Ms. Dorbecker Del Rio heard nothing more until she heard police sirens approaching, which she thought was about half an hour later. She could see flashing lights from the rear of the house. Later, the police came to the house, and she learnt about the deaths of Luke and Sam Willis.
44It was generally assumed that it was the appellant who threw the telephone books through the window. However when the appellant was already in custody, his son, Christopher junior, apparently told his parents that it was he who had done it, in retaliation for the vandalism of the appellant's utility the night before. He gave evidence at the trial, to the same effect. He said that he left his parent's home in Z street at about 5.00 pm on the Sunday afternoon, and drove around the block to 12 Y street. He said: ""I got out of the car, seen no one was at home, picked up a phone book, threw it through a window"". He then drove to his girlfriend's home, where he remained until he received a telephone call from his mother a little later in the evening.
45The appellant's son had initially objected to giving evidence against his father. He withdrew his objection when he was told that the Crown Prosecutor was not proposing to ask him questions, but was making him available for cross-examination at the request of defence counsel. His evidence as to the breaking of the window at Y Street was favourable to the defence, and defence counsel did not query it in any way. However the trial judge said that she had considerable difficulty with it and strongly suspected that the accused's son was shouldering the blame for this action in order to protect his father. Apart from anything else, his description of his actions did not accord with the material evidence. He said that he ""picked up a phone book"" which he threw through the window. However the photographs show that the window was broken by a white plastic bag, into which two telephone books had been placed, and which had then been tied at the top.
46Despite these misgivings, her Honour said that she must accept that it was the appellant's son, not the appellant himself, who broke the window at 12 Y Street. Her Honour said that ""given that the sworn testimony is all one way, there is no basis upon which I could possibly be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Filippou junior was lying when he gave this evidence.""
47Her Honour concluded that it was apparent that the when Luke and Sam Willis left the Y Street house they walked immediately around the block to the appellant's home. The appellant and his wife were there alone. Their son Christopher, who also lived there, had left earlier to go to his girlfriend's house.
48Mrs Filippou was interviewed by the police later that night. She said that at about 6.00 pm she heard male voices outside their home calling out for ""Chris"". At that time her husband was sitting in the loungeroom towards the back of the house, reading the paper. She went and told him about the yelling at the front. Both of them assumed that it was the ""dickheads"" from the house behind. The appellant went straight down the hall and out the front door. She could see two males outside. She assumed, she said, that the men were on the footpath rather than on their property, as she heard the appellant open the gate when he went out to them. Shortly afterwards the appellant came running back inside, saying ""Ring Christopher!"" She went to the telephone in the dining room, and rang their son. Telephone records show that the first call from the appellant's home to Christopher Filippou took place at 6.07 pm. After telling her to ring their son, the appellant ran straight back outside, where she could hear an altercation going on, with all three of them yelling. She made out the word ""police"". The appellant was angry, she said. Then, shortly afterwards, the appellant came running back inside, saying ""I'm going"". He went straight to the kitchen, grabbed the car keys, and went out the back door to the utility, which was parked in the driveway. He reversed it out and left immediately. The appellant's wife did not speak to him again that day. Not long afterwards she heard sirens outside, but she did not go out to see what had happened.
49Her Honour was in no doubt that the shooting of the Willis brothers took place when the appellant was outside with them. Mrs Filippou denied ever hearing any shots, saying that you could not hear what was happening out the front of the house if you were in a room towards the back.  Her Honour believed that this was one of the inconsistencies in the case. She also said that she could hear shouting. Her Honour said it could be expected that the sound of gunshots would be significantly more penetrating than voices, even loud voices. Many of the neighbours heard the shots, without apparently having heard the shouting that Mrs Filippou said preceded them, and all of these lived further away from the source of the sound than she was.
50The trial judge discussed the evidence of other people who lived in the vicinity. By far the most significant of these was Mr Brett Allen, who lived in A street, Mayfield. This street formed the top of a ""T"" intersection with Z Street. From windows at the front of his house, Mr Allen had a clear and unobstructed view down Z Street, past the appellant's home at No. 7. Mr Allen made a statement to the police later that evening, in which he said that as he was walking towards his front door he heard two popping sounds, like fire crackers, in very quick succession. He went to the window at the front of his house and saw the figure of a man on the nature strip outside the appellant's home. The area was generally well lit, Mr Allen said, and there was also a light shining from the front of No. 7. The man was side on to Mr Allen, and was bending slightly over, pointing to the ground with his right arm outstretched. Mr Allen saw the silhouette of something on the ground, but was unable to make out what it was. He then saw a flash come from the end of the man's arm, followed by a loud popping noise, the same as the noises he had heard earlier. Mr Allen realised that the man had been shooting a gun, and that the silhouette on the ground must have been a person. He immediately picked up the phone, which happened to be beside him, and rang 000. While he was on the phone, he saw the man walk ""fairly casually"" back into the front yard of No 7 where he went out of sight. About a minute later the same man returned to the nature strip, and crouched down over the silhouette on the ground. His arms were moving in a ""pulling motion"", according to Mr Allen. The man then stood up and returned into the front of No. 7. At that time the light at the front of the house went off. Shortly afterwards Mr Allen heard a vehicle start, and a white utility reversed out of the driveway of No. 7 and initially reversed up Z Street before driving off in the opposite direction. In the lights of the car Mr Allen could see a person lying on the nature strip.
51Mr Allen gave evidence at the trial, in which he affirmed the account given in his statement. He said that the first two shots were in very quick succession, only about a second apart. The total time between the first and third shots was between about five and ten seconds.
52Mr Allen was the only witness who actually saw anything happen in the street that evening. Other people in the vicinity heard the shots, and all but one of them confirmed Mr Allen's evidence as to the timing of the shots. Six people made statements to the police in which they said they heard two shots in rapid succession, followed by a third shot a few seconds later. The one who gave a different account said that it was several minutes between the second and third shots. However, given the overwhelming weight of the evidence in support of Mr Allen's version, Her Honour concluded that this witness was mistaken in his timing.
53The trial judge discussed the account of the events which the appellant gave to the police. He did not give evidence at his trial. His account is almost entirely contained within an ERISP which he entered into on the afternoon of Monday 28 June at Belmont Police Station. The appellant had earlier that day handed himself into the police at Belmont.
54Between handing himself into the police and the commencement of the ERISP, there was a brief conversation between the appellant and two police officers in which the appellant said:
""I don't want to say anything other than I shot them, they pulled a gun on me and I took it off 'em and shot 'em. They're shit. If you're going to pull a gun on me, be prepared to use it. That's all I'm going to say.""
55His ERISP lasted for nearly an hour, the transcript running to 31 pages. In it the appellant said that when the Willis brothers arrived outside his home on the Sunday evening, he was reading the paper in the dining room. He was drinking a stubby of beer with two scotch whiskeys, but he said that he was not affected by alcohol. His wife came and said: ""It must be those dickheads from the back, they're out the front yelling"". The appellant said that he went out the front door, where he could hear the men ""loud mouthing"" just outside the street. There were two of them: one, whom the appellant knew as Sam, and another whom he had never seen before. The lighting was good, the appellant said, as the front porch light was on. He walked out to the fence. At about that point the unknown man took a gun out of his pocket with his right hand and said ""I've got this"". The appellant immediately grabbed the gun with his own right hand, put his finger on the trigger, and shot ""that dickhead, Sam"". He said that he shot Sam first because he was still mouthing off. He then pointed the gun at the other man and shot him. At the time they were no more than a metre away from him. He was asked what happened then, and the following exchange took place:
""Q127   And what happened then?A I just left. Shoved the gun, I should have shoved the gun up his arse, but just left it on him and then left.
Q128 And who did you, when you say you left it on him, what do you mean?A Just in his hand or whatever I done, I don't remember to tell you the truth, you know what I mean, it was just, I just had to go.
Q129 Do you remember whose hand you lift (sic) it in?A No, I don't, not at that time.
Q130 Pardon?A No, I don't not at that time, I just...
Q131 You don't, O.K. Why did you do that?A Because it['s] theirs, they may as well keep it.
Q132 O.K. What did you do then?A Went inside, put me, this flannelette shirt on and just drove.
Q133 Yes. What car did you take?A The ute.""
56The appellant was told about Mr Allen's observations, and asked whether he remembered shooting someone on the ground. He said that he might have done so, but everything happened so fast that he could not remember the details. He initially said that he fired the gun two or three times, but then said that he ""just shot whatever bullets were there"", and he could not remember how many shots were fired.
57The first police to arrive at the scene were Senior Constable Stuart Tylor and Constable Bowman, in response to a radio message received at 6.15 pm that evening. Senior Constable Tylor said that when they arrived in Z Street they found two men lying on the grass verge outside No. 7. One of them was lying on his chest. The other was lying on his back with his right arm outstretched and a small revolver in his hand. His hand was in the trigger guard and very close to the trigger. Constable Tylor slid the revolver away from the man. He then realised that the man was dead. Constable Bowman checked the other man, lying face down, and said that he also was dead. Shortly afterwards, the paramedics arrived. They placed conductive pads on the man lying face upwards, and rolled the other man over. They confirmed that both men were deceased.
58It is clear that the man lying face upwards, with the gun in his hand, was Sam Willis. The other man was Luke Willis.
59Shortly afterwards, Constable Tylor said that Christopher Filippou junior walked along Z Street towards No. 7, calling out profanities, waving his arms and yelling ""hysterically"". He was detained by police, and was placed into a caged police vehicle in order to restrain him.
60On 29 June 2010 a post mortem examination was conducted on each of the two deceased. Sam Willis was found to have a bullet entry wound to the left side of his neck. The bullet had travelled through the neck from left to right, and had exited at the back right of the neck. No vital structures had been injured, and the wound would not have been fatal. The projectile has never been located. Her Honour found that this was almost certainly the first shot that was fired. There was also a bullet entry wound on the upper mid front of his chest. Her Honour concluded that the bullet had lacerated the arch of the aorta, causing extensive haemorrhaging into the chest cavity. This injury would have been rapidly fatal. The bullet was located under the skin on the left back of his chest. This must have been the third shot that was fired, when the victim was lying on the ground.
61Luke Willis was found to have a bullet entry wound on the outer front of his left chest. The bullet traversed the chest cavity and exited at the right back of the chest. Its path was in a front to backward, left to right and slightly downward direction. It had penetrated the left ventricle, both lungs and the aorta, with extensive bleeding into the chest cavities. Death would have been very rapid. A projectile was found on the road in Z Street which must have caused this injury, as it had blood on it which matched Luke's DNA profile.
62No alcohol or drugs were located in the blood of either of the victims.
63A ballistics expert, Mr Van der Walt, gave evidence for the Crown. He conducted proximity tests in relation to each of the three entry wounds. As a result, he concluded that the shots which caused each of the chest wounds were discharged from a distance of between 800 millimetres and a metre. The shot which caused Sam Willis's neck wound was discharged from a distance of approximately 300 millimetres.
64The trial judge concluded that no significance could be attached to the fact that one of the projectiles has never been located, nor to the precise position of the projectile on the roadway. For there was a considerable amount of traffic and movement in the area during the period immediately after the shooting, and they could easily have been unwittingly moved or removed.
65In June 2010 the appellant was employed as a cleaner at the Belair Public School at Adamstown, which is 7.6 kilometres from the appellant's home in Z Street. At 7.03 pm on the evening of 27 June the alarm system at the school was disarmed by a person using the appellant's pin code. At 7.15 pm a phone call was made from the Belair School to the home of a person to whom the trial judge gave the name Margaret. Margaret's statement was tendered by the Crown. She did not give evidence in person. Margaret lived at North Belmont, about 13 kilometres from the school. The call was from a man she knew as ""Steve Tatu"". Margaret knew Steve through a singles social group which she had joined in the late 1990's. Steve had telephoned her, and they had arranged to meet for a drink. No details were given in her statement as to the relationship which then developed between them, but it must be assumed that some relationship existed between them at some stage. Margaret said in her statement that the last time she had seen ""Steve"" was just before Christmas 2009.
66Margaret said that on the evening of Sunday 27 June she received a phone call from ""Steve."" She instantly recognised his voice. He asked if he could come and see her. She agreed, and he arrived within about an hour. They sat down and chatted. He asked if he could stay that night and the Monday night, saying that if it was not convenient he would sleep in the garage. He asked where he could buy some cigarettes. Margaret suggested Foodworks, and agreed to go with him to show him the way. They both then went in ""Steve's"" white utility to Foodworks, where they each bought some cigarettes. When they returned home they chatted some more and watched some television. Margaret commented that ""Steve"" was different. He seemed to be on edge. Eventually Margaret went to bed, and a little later ""Steve"" followed her, fully clothed. She said that he was very restless. At one time she found him in the family room using her phone. It is apparent from the telephone records tendered by the Crown that these calls took place between 6.23 and 6.27 in the morning, and that the calls were made to the appellant's two daughters. A little later ""Steve"" asked Margaret where he could get a newspaper. She told him where the newsagent was. Not long afterwards she realised that ""Steve"" was gone, as was the utility.
67About six weeks later the police called at Margaret's home, having traced her through the telephone records of Belair School. They asked her if she knew Chris Filippou, and she answered that she had never heard of a man by that name. They then showed her a photograph taken at Foodworks on the night of 27 June, and she immediately recognised herself and the person she knew as Steve Tatu. The Crown also tendered a DVD of Margaret and ""Steve"" at Foodworks that night. There is no doubt at all that her companion was the appellant.
68It was not until 10.35 am on the Monday morning that the appellant handed himself into the Belmont Police Station. There is no evidence as to his movements in the meantime.
69There is one final conversation between the police and the appellant of relevance. This comes from the statement of Senior Constable Benjamin King, who was in charge of forensic procedures involving the appellant. At about 6.00 pm on 28 June he said to the appellant: ""Why did you come to Belmont, Chris?"" The appellant responded: ""To tell you the truth I didn't even know there was a Police Station here. I asked four people on the street, I haven't been down here for a long time."" Constable King asked: ""Where did you spend last night?"" The accused said:
""I just stayed in my ute in Adamstown getting my head together. I was heading to Sydney. I was going to slip back into Punchbowl and you never would have found me. Then I thought you would give my family a hard time and I didn't want that. I was always taught never bring a gun unless you are prepared to use it.""
70Up to this point Constable King said that the appellant had appeared calm. However his demeanour suddenly changed and he clenched his fists, gritted his teeth and said, with anger in his voice: ""I'm fucking proud of what I done. Fucking proud of it.""
Provocation
71The only issue in the trial was whether the Crown had proved that the appellant had not acted under provocation. There was no suggestion that the appellant acted in self defence. Section 23 of the Crimes Act 1900 presently provides the legal structure within which the ""defence"" of provocation may be established. Section 23 provides:
""(1) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation and, but for this subsection and the provocation, the jury would have found the accused guilty of murder, the jury shall acquit the accused of murder and find the accused guilty of manslaughter.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an act or omission causing death is an act done or omitted under provocation where: (a) the act or omission is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased (including grossly insulting words or gestures) towards or affecting the accused, and(b) that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased,
whether that conduct of the deceased occurred immediately before the act or omission causing death or at any previous time.
(3) For the purpose of determining whether an act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), there is no rule of law that provocation is negatived if: (a) there was not a reasonable proportion between the act or omission causing death and the conduct of the deceased that induced the act or omission,(b) the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted suddenly, or(c) the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted with any intent to take life or inflict grievous bodily harm.
(4) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, there is any evidence that the act causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted under provocation.
(5) This section does not exclude or limit any defence to a charge of murder.""
72Her Honour concluded that but for the question of provocation the appellant would be guilty of murder. Her Honour's judgment includes a discussion of s 23(2) and s 23(3) and correctly identifies the elements of each section and the fact that the onus rests upon the Crown, if provocation has been raised, to disprove it beyond reasonable doubt. As her Honour indicated this can be done by the Crown disproving either of the elements in s 23(2) to the requisite standard.
73Her Honour indicated that counsel were in agreement that identical issues were raised in relation to each of the counts with which the appellant had been charged. The two deceased were clearly acting in concert when they went to the appellant's home and accordingly provocative conduct by either of them was relevant in relation to both counts. 
74Her Honour first considered whether the appellant had lost his self control. In the course of considering this question her Honour examined the evidence in relation to whether or not the appellant had the gun or whether it was brought to the scene by one of the victims. Her Honour concluded that although it was probable that the appellant brought the revolver into the confrontation there was ""insufficient evidence to satisfy me of that matter beyond reasonable doubt, or to put it another way: although I consider it unlikely that one of the Willis brothers brought the gun with him, I cannot conclude that it is not reasonably possible that he did so."" Her Honour then indicated that this finding was significant because the appellant relied upon the brandishing of the revolver as a major part of the provocative conduct causing him to lose his self control together with the fact that the two men were calling out or ""loud mouthing"" outside the appellant's home. Her Honour indicated that the ""loud mouthing"" would almost certainly not have constituted adequate provocation: R v R (1981) 28 SASR 321; Moffa v The Queen (1977) 138 CLR 601 at 616.
75When considering the issue of the loss of self control by the appellant her Honour instructed herself that ""a loss of self control involves a temporary suspension of the capacity to reason, or to think rationally and sensibly."" It is a question of fact.
76Much was made at the trial of the fact that the first two shots were fired in rapid succession followed by a gap of some seconds before the firing of the third shot. That issue was again ventilated before this Court. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the gap may have been explained by the fact that the appellant was pulling the trigger of the gun but the chambers were empty and accordingly no shots were fired. The trial judge believed this to be a matter of mere speculation observing that a good explanation for the gap between the second and third shots is provided by the known sequence of events supported by the evidence of Mr Allan. The first and second shots were fired at the two brothers when they were still standing and close to the appellant. The third shot was fired from a completely different angle. The appellant was observed by Mr Allan to be bending over slightly with his arm outstretched and pointing towards the silhouette on the ground before the third shot was fired.
77For these reasons the trial judge concluded that the appellant's acts were not of themselves such as to indicate a loss of self control on his part. Her Honour said that ""if anything, his conduct both during the shooting and immediately after it, point in the opposite direction.""
78The trial judge observed that there was a significant factual question arising because of what her Honour believed to be the different observations of Mr Allan and the evidence of the appellant's wife, Mrs Filippou. Mrs Filippou said that after the appellant went out into the street the first time he briefly came back into the house and ask her to ring their son. Her Honour believed that this was consistent with Mr Allan's observations. But she also said that after the appellant went out again she could hear the altercation continuing. Her Honour concluded that if this evidence was correct the shooting must have occurred on the second occasion that the appellant went out onto the street. However, her Honour thought that Mr Allan's evidence would suggest that the shooting occurred on the first occasion and on the later occasion the appellant returned to place the gun in the hand of the deceased, Sam Willis.
79This of course overlooks the fact that Mr Allan was not alerted to look in the direction of the incident until he heard the sound of the gun being fired. This could only have been after, on Mrs Filipou's account, the appellant had briefly returned inside, an event which would have occurred before Mr Allan made his observations.
80Her Honour compared the two accounts and concluded that the evidence of Mr Allan should be accepted. For my part having read the evidence I do not discern any necessary inconsistency.
81Her Honour concluded that the most likely picture of the relevant events was as follows:
""When the accused first went out to the street, a verbal confrontation took place between himself and the Willis brothers which culminated in the shooting. The accused then went back inside and asked his wife to ring their son, before returning to the scene of the shooting and placing the revolver into Sam Willis's hand. After doing that he went straight back inside, took his car keys and immediately drove off.""
82However, for my part I am satisfied that this account is not correct. I am satisfied that the appellant went out to the street and then returned inside. He then went out again, the brothers were shot and the appellant then went inside or moved in that direction before returning to place the gun and then again leave the scene by returning to the house. Although after the shooting Mr Allan observed the appellant to walk back into the front yard of the house he did not see him go inside. Mrs Filipou said that the appellant came back inside on two occasions but on the second occasion rather than return to the scene of the shooting he took a motor vehicle and left altogether. 
83Her Honour observed that Mr Allan described the appellant as walking ""quite calmly"" when he went back towards the house. Mrs Filippou said that he was running, or was walking quickly and was angry. Her Honour concluded that the appellant's actions in returning outside and placing the revolver into Sam Willis's hand is an action ""at least suggestive of rational thinking.""
84Again, I believe her Honour has not identified the correct sequence. On the first occasion the appellant went back inside, which was before the shooting he was agitated. However, after the brothers had been shot his demeanour changed and he in relative calm returned to place the gun. 
85Her Honour then turned to consider the statements which the appellant had made when he was interviewed by the police. Her Honour said:
""The first relevant comment was made shortly after the accused handed himself into police on the morning of 28 June 2010.   He said:
'.. they pulled a gun on me and I took it off 'em and shot 'em. They're shit. If you're going to pull a gun on me be prepared to use it.'
Later, during the course of his ERISP, the accused said (in answer to question 43):
'..one of them, the right handed one pulled a gun and he goes, I've got this. I said, you've got that, have you? And then I ripped it off him and shot them. That's it. No more and no less. You know, they want to be heroes, that's what happens.'
Three answers later, he volunteered the following comment:
'But I've always said, you know, come fight, you know, by fist. Pull a gun on some cunt, sorry sweetness, pull a gun on someone, it's a different story altogether, right.'
The accused went on to describe the shooting, during the course of which he made the comment (described more fully in paragraph [54] above): ""I should have shoved the gun up his arse.""  Finally, towards the end of the ERISP, the following exchange occurred:
'Q166 Why would you have shot him when he was on theground?A It was, just, it was just happening, right. He, that's what happened, I shot them, you've got your thing, you know, lock me up so to speak ...
Q:167: All rightA: ...but you know, don't come around to my place and be heroes, you know, like I've always been taught if you pull a gun use it on someone. You know, don't be a hero and ...
Q168 How were you feeling at the time, Chris?A Well I was feeling nothing to tell you the truth when they, I mean I just wanted to know what they were going on about when I went out the front, sort of thing. Do you get me? But after I shot them like to tell you the truth, you know, they probably deserved what they got. Right. Either get shot or, or shoot them, so to speak. So that's it, I'm not going to go into any more, I shot 'em, you got your thing, you know, your charges whatever you got, you know.'
The last relevant comment made by the accused that day was when he said to Senior Constable King later that afternoon: ""I was always taught never to bring a gun unless you are prepared to use it"", followed by a change of demeanour, and his saying: ""I'm fucking proud of what I done. Fucking proud of it"". (See paragraph [71] above.)
The accused has been in custody since his arrest on 28 June 2010. On 18 August 2010, when he was in Parklea Correctional Centre, he made a telephone call to his wife, which was recorded and tendered into evidence. During the course of the conversation the following exchange took place:
'FILIPPOU: They come around with a fucken gun we didn'tGlenda: No I know that' see that's our good point tooFILIPPOU: No there'll be no good points to thisGlenda: No but I mean you didn't it wasn't plannedFILIPPOU: No no noGlenda: You know what I mean it wasn't a planned thingFILIPPOU: It should have fucken been you know what I mean fucken garbage like that what the fuck was their fucken problemGlenda: Who the hell do they think they areFILIPPOU: Yeah who the hell do they think they are that's what theGlenda: That's what I get angry atFILIPPOU: Who the fuck do they think they are coming around like fucken would be gangstersGlenda: Who the hell do they think they are somebody special who can do as they please with everythingFILIPPOU: That's what I mean you know like I said to ya if they had of fucken brought a knife I would have cut their fucken heads offGlenda: YeahFILIPPOU: You know that's that's what amazes with these those sort of peopleGlenda: Gives ya the shits they're just garbage people.'
86The trial judge correctly observed that it was not necessary for an accused person to say after the event that he or she had lost self-control in order for the ""defence"" of provocation to succeed. It depends upon the evidence. Her Honour concluded that it was ""abundantly clear"" from the totality of the evidence that the appellant was at the relevant time an inherently angry man. This was sought to be used to his advantage by his counsel who submitted that he had a low threshold of tolerance and was particularly susceptible to losing his self-control when confronted by the two brothers calling abuse outside his home and wielding a gun.
87With respect to the issue of the appellant losing his self-control her Honour said that she regarded the statements made by the appellant after the event as ultimately determinative of this issue, for the following reasons: 
""...A loss of self-control under s 23 necessarily involves the accused committing the act causing death whilst his capacity to think rationally has been temporarily suspended by reason of the provocative conduct of the deceased. By definition it is an act which the person would not have done if he was in his normal state of mind. It follows that if the person continues, well after the effect of the provocative conduct has ceased, to justify his conduct and indicate that he would do the same thing again in the same situation, then this is inconsistent with the proposition that it was a temporary loss of self-control which caused him to act as he did. And this is precisely what the accused has continued to do. He did it several times the following day, when he was being interviewed by the Police. Amongst other things, he said that the deceased brothers ""probably deserved what they got"", and that he was ""fucking proud"" of what he had done. This is not the attitude of a man who has come back to rationality after a temporary loss of control.  Even in his telephone conversation with his wife some six weeks later he was placing the blame on the deceased brothers, saying that they were ""just garbage people"".
88Her Honour then expressed her conclusion in the following terms:
""I am firmly of the view that it was the accused's inherently angry nature which led to his behaving as he did when he fired the fatal shots. I am abundantly satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that it was a loss of self-control which caused him to fire those shots.""
89For this reason her Honour concluded that the ""defence"" of provocation ""could not succeed."" However, her Honour proceeded to consider the issues raised by s 23(2)(b), which she shortly described as the ""ordinary person test.""
90Her Honour instructed herself as to the elements of the test and in particular that it is established that the particular attributes, characteristics and background of an accused are relevant in assessing the gravity of the effect of the provocative conduct of the person in question. Her Honour referred to the decision of the High Court in Masciantonio v The Queen [1995] HCA 67; (1995) 183 CLR 58 at 67 where Brennan CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ said:
""However, the gravity of the conduct said to constitute the provocation must be assessed by reference to relevant characteristics of the accused. Conduct which might not be insulting or hurtful to one person might be extremely so to another because of that persons' age, sex, race, ethnicity, physical features, personal attributes, personal relationships or past history. The provocation must be put into context and it is only by having regard to the attributes or characteristics of the accused that this can be done. But having assessed the gravity of the provocation in this way, it is then necessary to ask the question whether provocation of that degree of gravity could cause an ordinary person to lose self-control and act in a manner which would encompass the accused's actions.""
91Apart from her finding that the appellant was an inherently angry man with a susceptibility to lose his temper quickly her Honour otherwise determined that he had no particular characteristics that would have made him more vulnerable. Her Honour identified the history of neighbourhood conflict between the households and the fact that on the previous evening the appellant's car had been the subject of minor vandalism. However, the conflict between the households had never previously involved physical clashes. Her Honour believed that the history of conflict ""might well"" have made the appellant more wary when he went outside and confronted the two brothers.
92Her Honour then expressed the following conclusions in relation to the ""ordinary person test"":
""The second stage of the test is whether, given this background, an ordinary person in the position of the accused could have so far lost self-control as to have formed the intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased. And it is here that the defence case must fail.
When the accused went out of his home that evening he was confronted by two young men who were calling out and shouting. They may well have been using abusive language. But as we heard many times during the course of the trial, the accused himself was no stranger to strong language, and he regularly peppered his speech with swear words. The additional provocation in this case consisted of Luke Willis producing a revolver and saying 'We've got this'. It was at this point that the accused grabbed the gun from Luke and proceeded to shoot both brothers at point blank range, starting with Sam, who was the one who was 'mouthing off'.
I am quite unable to accept that an ordinary person, confronted with this situation, could have lost self-control so as to form an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the brothers. I am hesitant to use the word 'disproportionate', for there is no requirement of proportionality in relation to the defence of provocation as currently formulated. However, if the response is grossly disproportionate to the provocation, then it inevitably means that it will fail the 'ordinary person' test. And that, in my view, is clearly the situation here.
Had the accused, contrary to my earlier finding, in fact lost his self-control when he shot the two brothers, then this could only have been because of his own unusually low threshold of uncontrollable anger. This does not assist him in relation to the defence of provocation. As Brennan CJ said in Green v R (1997) 191 CLR 334 at 340; 149 ALR 659 at 660:
'Paragraph (b) requires the jury to take account of the sting of the provocation actually experienced by the accused, but eliminates from the jury's consideration any extra-ordinary response by the accused to the provocation actually experienced. Thus extra-ordinary aggressiveness or extra-ordinary want of self-control on the part of an accused confer no protection against conviction for murder.'
It follows that the defence of provocation must fail, and I find the accused guilty of murder in relation to both charges.""
93Before turning to consider the specific grounds of appeal I should refer to the submissions made on behalf of the appellant in relation to the firing of the gun. The weapon was a 5-shot Smith & Wesson pistol. When it was examined by a scientific officer from the Forensic Ballistics Investigation Section of the police he found that chambers 3, 4 and 5 contained spent cartridges. The chamber under the hammer was empty indicating that there had been an attempt to discharge the firearm after the last shot had been fired. However, it was not possible to determine the position in which the chamber may have been when the trigger was first pulled.
94The appellant offered a variety of alternatives as to the number of times the trigger had been pulled and the sequence in which the trigger was pulled and cartridges fired. From this analysis the appellant argued that the trigger must have been pulled more than 3 times making it less likely that the appellant had produced the gun having previously loaded it himself. It was also submitted to be relevant to the appellant's asserted lack of self-control that he may have pulled the trigger on more occasions than there were bullets in the chamber.
95In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 at [11] - [14] (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ), the High Court set out the test to be applied when considering an appeal on the basis that a verdict was unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence: 
""The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal
It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:
""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".
This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""
The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses.  However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced.  It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""
Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter.
In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"".  In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:
""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict.  Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1).  The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'."" (footnotes omitted)
96In relation to grounds of appeal 1(a), 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) the appellant submitted that it was accepted that the appellant at no stage expressed any regret or remorse for his actions. It was submitted that her Honour appears to have regarded this evidence of the appellant's apparent lack of remorse as fatal to his case on the issue of loss of self-control. It was submitted that the portion of her Honour's reasons which I have extracted at [88] contains significant errors of law and misdirections. In particular it was submitted that the actions of a person well after the event and statements that he or she would do the same thing again were not relevant to the issue of whether at the time of the shooting the appellant had lost his self control.
97It was submitted that her Honour's use of the word ""continues"" strongly suggests an assumption on Her Honour's part, that the state of mind that the appellant evidenced in his statements to the police was but a continuation of the state of mind that had existed at the time of the shooting. It was asserted that this was an assumption that her Honour was not entitled to make.
98It may be accepted that a tribunal of fact may in various circumstances have regard to the subsequent statements of an accused person to assist in understanding the state of mind of a person at a relevant time. Sometimes there is no difficulty in doing so, the most obvious occasion being where an accused person unequivocally asserts that he had a particular state of mind at the relevant time.
99Where, however, an accused person's statements do not unequivocally assert a particular state of mind the question is whether any inference can be drawn from those statements as going to establish the state of mind at the relevant time. An obvious example is where the prosecution submits that lies were told by an accused person out of a consciousness of guilt and may be relevant to establish the state of mind of an accused person at the time of the relevant offence. Part of the direction given to a jury in those circumstances would be a caution about too readily drawing the asserted inference and the need to be satisfied that the inference as to the state of mind sought to be established by the Crown is the only rational available inference.
100In the present case none of the statements of the appellant spoke unequivocally as to his state of mind at the time of the shootings. He did not assert that he lost his self control and nor was he required to do so in order to raise the issue of provocation. In the case of each statement relied upon by her Honour the appellant expressed a state of mind at that time, that is his state of mind at the point in time at which he was speaking. The possible exception is in the ERISP.
""Q168 How were you feeling at the time Chris?A Well I was feeling nothing to tell you the truth, I mean I just wanted to know what they were going on about when I went out the front, sort of thing. Do you get me? But after I shot them [emphasis added] like to tell you the truth, you know, they probably deserved what they got. Right. Either get shot or, or shoot them, so to speak. So that's it, I'm not going to go into any more, I shot 'em, you got your thing, you know, your charges whatever you got you know.
101The question did not with any particularity direct the appellant to respond with respect to his capacity or actions at the time of the shooting. The first part of the answer deals with the appellant's state of mind at the time that the two deceased went to the front of his home. The balance deals with his state of mind after the shooting.
102It was open to her Honour to have regard to the appellant's subsequent statements to the extent they were capable of shedding light on his state of mind at the time of the shootings. However, her Honour could not reason that because those statements made at a time when the appellant was apparently calm and rational, sought to justify the killing without a suggestion that he lost control were determinative of his state of mind at the time of the shootings. Nor could the statements of themselves negative loss of self-control.
103There is an ambiguity in her Honour's reasons. Her Honour said that the appellant's later statements were ""ultimately determinative"" of the issue. If her Honour meant that they alone determined the issue I could not agree. If she meant that they provided determinative weight I, with respect, could also not agree. To my mind the statement justifying his conduct together with the indication that he would do the same thing again (although no doubt engendering a sense of revulsion in ordinary people), does not provide any significant assistance in determining the state of mind under which the appellant did the relevant acts and whether he lost his self control. It is conceivable that a person who temporarily loses their self-control may later not regret their actions. Although they may have acted in a complete absence of control, later justification of their actions may not prove to be of any assistance to the prosecution case.
104There are many ways in which the point can be illustrated. A man may kill the person who has killed his wife or child. The fact that that person may be proud that they had done so or assert that they would do it again or assert that their victims deserved their fates, would not inevitably, on account of those feelings or assertions lead to the conclusion that they had not acted while under a loss of self-control. Indeed they could indicate the opposite.
105Notwithstanding my reservations about her Honour's approach to the issue I am not persuaded that her Honour's conclusion was erroneous. Indeed, having considered the evidence I am satisfied that the Crown discharged the onus that it carried to the criminal standard. I have previously related the findings that her Honour made in relation to the actions of the appellant and the observations of his movements made by the witnesses. The appellant said in his ERISP that he removed the gun from one of the deceased and then fired it to kill both brothers. There was nothing to suggest that he acted as a result of losing his self-control. Indeed the only available conclusion was that in taking the gun and shooting the brothers he acted in a deliberate and calculated way not only in firing the first two shots but in firing the third shot, which the evidence established was responsible for the death of Sam Willis.
106There was nothing to suggest that having approached the brothers as he said in his ERISP ""feeling nothing"" he thereafter almost instantly changed his response and lost control. It must be remembered that the appellant had previously threatened to shoot Sam Wilis, a threat that the circumstances enabled him to carry out. Having killed the brothers the appellant was observed to walk ""fairly casually"" away.
107In reaching this conclusion I have not overlooked the argument that the appellant may have pulled the trigger on the gun on more than three occasions. This may have happened. However, to my mind it does not either by itself or with any other evidence suggest that the appellant may have lost his self-control. I am also satisfied that the delay between the second and third shots, identified by Mr Allan as a matter of seconds, was almost certainly due to the appellant changing position and firing at Sam Willis who by this stage had collapsed onto the ground.
108Complaint was made that her Honour failed to warn herself about the caution necessary in drawing inferences. There is no reason to doubt that her Honour, a very experienced trial judge, was mindful of the need to be careful in this respect and there is nothing in her Honour's judgment which would suggest that the proffered criticism could be sustained.
109With respect to the issue concerning the ""ordinary person"" the appellant criticised her Honour's conclusion, which I have incorporated at [93] above.
110It was submitted that by expressing herself as she did her Honour has reversed the onus of proof. I am not persuaded that the submission should be accepted. The criticism is focused on the paragraph which commences with the words ""I am quite unable to accept ..."" A reading of the entire paragraph suggests that her Honour may have merely been intending to convey that in the circumstances she was satisfied beyond any doubt that an ordinary person could not have been induced to lose their self-control and kill the brothers. Her Honour's finding is reflected in the last sentences of the paragraph where she identifies the response as being grossly disproportionate to the provocation with the consequence that the Crown has proved its case to the criminal standard.
111Irrespective of whether her Honour should be understood as framing her conclusion in an inappropriate manner I am nevertheless completely satisfied that there has been no miscarriage of justice. Even accepting the appellant's submission that he did not bring the gun to the scene and that he responded to the fact that the brothers brought it, he must have taken it from the brother carrying it and then without any apparent hesitation used it to kill both of them. There was no suggestion of a struggle or any attempt by the appellant to remove himself from the scene or deal with the situation without using the gun. I have no doubt that an ordinary person with the characteristics of the appellant, including his tendency to anger, would not have acted as the appellant did in the circumstances by taking the gun and forming the intention to kill.
The sentence appeal
112The appellant raises one ground of appeal against sentence:
A sentence less severe is warranted at law and ought to have been imposed upon the basis that:
(a) Her Honour erred in assessing the offences as of a mid range objective seriousness; and
(b) Her Honour erred in treating the standard non-parole [period] as a starting point for determination of [the] sentence. 
113Her Honour sentenced the appellant at a time when the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 had been handed down. Unfortunately, the decision was not brought to her attention. Accordingly, her Honour has sentenced in accordance with the principles provided by this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, which the High Court have since rejected.
114Her Honour found the offences to fall within the mid range of seriousness. It was submitted that this exaggerated the criminality involved. It was submitted that the appellant being confronted outside his home by two aggressive young men committed the offence on the spur of the moment without the slightest premeditation. Accordingly, it was submitted the offences should have been found to fall below the mid range of seriousness.
115It was further submitted that, there being two persons who were killed, it was appropriate for her Honour to provide for some accumulation but that the accumulation of six years was excessive. 
116Notwithstanding that her Honour has sentenced in accordance with the principles in Way I am not persuaded that any other sentence was required in law. As the High Court indicated in Muldrock, both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period are relevant as guide posts when sentencing an offender. The maximum penalty will have greater relevance when an offender is being sentenced for an offence found to be in the worst category. The standard non-parole period may have greater relevance for an offence which the sentencing judge finds to be within the mid range of objective seriousness. Provided the standard non-parole period does not exert excessive influence or determinative significance, the sentencing discretion will not miscarry.
117It is apparent that her Honour found that both of the killings were serious examples of murder. At the time when they were shot and killed the two brothers were unarmed. They were not provided with any opportunity to escape and were shot at point blank range. Her Honour found, in my view correctly, that the appellant must have realised that despite the seriousness of the wound he inflicted on Sam Willis's neck that wound was not fatal so he fired a further shot into his chest with the intention of killing him. Luke Willis was a stranger to the appellant. Her Honour described the murders as ""so senseless and so unnecessary."" To my mind this was an appropriate description.
118The murder of the two brothers came at the end of a period of 18 months of apparent conflict between the parties. However, there was nothing to suggest that that conflict might end with the brothers being shot. The appellant formed an intention to kill and did so in a public street firing a second shot into Sam Willis when he was lying incapacitated by the wound to his neck.
119There is nothing in the appellant's subjective circumstances to adequately explain or ameliorate the seriousness of his offending. He is a mature man who was in fulltime employment. There was no evidence of mental illness. There was no suggestion that alcohol or drugs were causally connected to his offending. The only mitigating factor was that the offences appear to have been unplanned.
120In these circumstances I am satisfied that the standard non-parole period was an important guidepost when sentencing. I am not persuaded that by imposing a non-parole period of 20 years for each offence her Honour has erred.
121With respect to the issue of accumulation it is necessary to consider the principle discussed by the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465. The overall sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offences having regard to all of the circumstances. It is important to remember that although multiple offences may form part of one criminal enterprise, where there is separate and serious criminality involved the sentences will usually be partially accumulated: R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115 at [52]; (2009) 195 A Crim R 38.
122It will be a rare case where multiple persons are murdered where a degree of accumulation is not appropriate. In the present case it was necessary for her Honour to mark out the fact that two persons' lives were taken. Accumulation of at last 5 years was, in all the circumstances, entirely justified.
123For these reasons I am satisfied that, notwithstanding her Honour's formulation of her remarks without reference to the decision of the High Court in Muldrock, the sentences were entirely appropriate and no lesser sentence was warranted in law.
Orders1. Leave to appeal against conviction in relation to Grounds 1 and 3 granted.2. Appeal against conviction dismissed.3. Leave to appeal against sentence granted but appeal dismissed.

2761414,Gavin v R [2013] NSWCCA 99,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Campbell J.

2HALL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Campbell J. 

3CAMPBELL J: The applicant seeks leave pursuant to s.5(1)(c) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to appeal from the severity of the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court of NSW by his Honour Judge Keleman S.C. on 29th April 2011.

4The only ground advanced in support of the application is that the sentence is manifestly excessive.

5The applicant was sentenced for one count of armed robbery causing grievous bodily harm, contrary to s.98 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of seven years.

6The sentence consists of a non-parole period of six years commencing on 20th June 2009 and expiring on 19th June 2015, with an additional term of three years commencing on 20th June 2015 and expiring on 19th June 2018. The earliest date on which the applicant is eligible to be released on parole is 19th June 2015.

Facts

7The offence was committed on 7th April 2008. The victim was a housemate residing in accommodation which the applicant was then sharing with his brother at Lalor Park.

8The applicant was armed with two offensive weapons, being an iron bar and a small knife. The iron bar was a metal wheel brace. During the commission of the offence he struck his victim a number of times with the iron bar and stabbed him once with the small knife. 

9He robbed the victim of $15 (which was all the money the victim had), his ATM card (forcing him to provide the PIN number), and a mobile phone, on which he made numerous phone calls. 

10Viewed objectively, the offence involved significant cruelty and callousness. The applicant entered the victim's bedroom in the shared accommodation and roughly woke him from his sleep. He menacingly demanded money from him. When the victim remonstrated with the offender, he struck him hard on the top of his head with the iron bar and reiterated his demands.

11The victim handed over his $15. The applicant was not satisfied and struck the victim again, this time on his back. He then demanded the ATM card, pin number, and phone, all of which the victim surrendered.

12When the victim told the applicant that there was little money in the account, the applicant made it clear he did not believe him. He threatened the victim that if the PIN number was wrong ""I will be back to finish you"". 

13While the applicant was using the victim's phone, the victim tried to escape. The applicant chased him and knocked the victim's hands off the front door by striking them with the bar. He then told the victim to lie down. As he was doing so the applicant struck him again on the back with the metal bar, causing him to fall.

14The applicant then ""hog tied"" the victim and again threatened to kill him if the PIN number was wrong.

15The victim tried to feign a loss of consciousness in the hope that the applicant would stop assaulting him. But the applicant said, ""You're just foxing me. Well let's see if you are foxing me."" He then stabbed the victim in the foot eliciting a scream of pain, which provoked laughter on the part of the applicant. 

16The applicant then left the premises, warning the victim against calling the police.

17The victim was left ""hog tied"", drifting in and out of consciousness for some hours before being able to free himself.

18A neighbour arranged for an ambulance to attend which took the victim to Nepean Hospital.

19The victim suffered a number of wounds and painful injuries, including five fractured ribs, an undisplaced fracture of the ulnar bone in the left arm and a fracture of the ring finger of his right hand. He required stitches, an above the elbow plaster cast on the left arm, and strapping of the right hand. 

20The applicant did not return to the premises, but absconded to Victoria, using the stolen mobile phone to call family and friends.

21Victorian Police arrested him for breaching the bail previously granted in that State for unrelated matters, and he was remanded in custody. 

22An arrest warrant was issued from the Local Court of NSW on 14th July 2008 in respect of the subject offence.

23I interpolate that the sentencing judge partially accumulated his sentence so it commenced 12 months after the applicant went into custody for the Victorian offences. This had the effect of backdating the sentence in New South Wales by about thirteen months and one week.

24The sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of the offending as falling ""at the upper end of the middle range of objective seriousness for such offences"".





Aggravating factors 

25The applicant's offending was attended by a number of significantly aggravating factors: 

(a)the offence involved actual and threatened violence;

(b)the offence involved the use of weapons, being the iron bar and knife;

(c)the applicant has a long record of previous convictions including crimes of personal violence;

(d)the offence was committed in the victim's home; 

(e)the offence involved gratuitous cruelty;

(f)the injuries caused by the offence were substantial;

(g)the offence was committed while the offender was on conditional liberty in relation to offences in Victoria;

(h)the victim was vulnerable in as much as he was asleep in his home when the applicant first approached him, and he was unarmed;

(i)although only one offence was charged, it involved a series of criminal acts; and

(j)the offence was committed for financial gain.

The applicant's subjective case

26The applicant was born on 29th September 1954 and accordingly was 53 years and 7 months of age at the time of the offending. The primary judge found that he had a most unfortunate childhood. Both of his parents were alcoholics. His mother additionally suffered from mental illness and was violent towards him.

27Rheumatic fever as a child led to deformity of his lower limbs which prevented him from walking until ten years of age. He had very little schooling, attending only between the ages of ten and thirteen years. Since then his employment history has been, as the sentencing judge put it, ""sparse"", involving unskilled work.

28He was the victim of sexual abuse by an uncle from the ages of five to twelve years. He has been drinking alcohol since the age of ten and has abused it throughout his life. He is also an amphetamine user and according to his own account on the day of the offence he had used about 1.6 grams of amphetamine and had been drinking beer all day with friends. He told the psychiatrist, Dr. Furst (Exhibit 1), that he ""was rushing off [his] head"". The sentencing judge found that alcohol abuse and illicit drug use impeded the applicant's employment prospects, and contributed to his criminality, over the years.

29Psychiatric evidence accepted by the primary judge was to the effect that, based upon psychological assessment, the applicant had a borderline intellect placing him in the lowest third percentile of the population, restricting his comprehension and capacity for logical and abstract reasoning. He suffered a degree of institutionalisation and an anti-social personality disorder manifesting itself in incidents of self-harm whilst institutionalised. He has an underlying dysfunctional personality. 

30During his most recent imprisonment in Victoria, the applicant had been employed manufacturing hot water heaters; had undertaken programs conducted through the Salvation Army; and had applied for the SMART Program, but it seems that he had not yet had the benefit of participation in the program by the time he was examined by Dr. Furst on the 15th of November 2010. According to an affidavit read on the hearing of this application, he has now undertaken that course in NSW. The sentencing judge seemed to accept that the offender required community based rehabilitation and psychiatric treatment. A pre-sentence report indicated that the applicant would benefit from a medium degree of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. However, his Honour found that the applicant hoped to return to Victoria upon his release on parole.

31The sentencing judge accepted the sincerity of the expressions of remorse contained in two letters the applicant wrote to the Court, forming Exhibit 2. Given the applicant's age and lengthy criminal history, his Honour was not able to conclude that he was not likely to re-offend in the future. For the same reasons, his Honour had no confidence in his rehabilitation prospects. They were fair only even if the applicant maintained his motivation to change his life, and abstained from alcohol and illicit drug use.

32His Honour accepted that the applicant had pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity.

Reasons for sentence

33The sentencing judge found the offence to be ""objectively most serious"". His Honour laid emphasis on the considerations of general and personal deterrence, and punishment. He referred to, as an aggravating feature, the fact that the offence was committed whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty. 

34He accepted that the offence was committed whilst the applicant was under the influence of alcohol and illicit drugs, and conventionally held that such a circumstance, whilst not mitigating, provided an explanation of ""how the present offences came to be committed"": R. v. Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at 382 [178] per Spigelman CJ, at 396 [265] per Wood CJ at CL, at 409 [331] per Hulme J, and at 413 [348] - [349] per Simpson J.

35At the outset of his reasons his Honour referred to the legislative guideposts of the maximum term of 25 years and the standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment. His Honour then discussed all the facts, matters and circumstances he considered relevant to sentencing before stating (at ROS 13-14):

In relation to the present offence a standard non parole period of seven years imprisonment is provided by the legislation. This applies for an offence falling within the middle range of objective seriousness for such an offence following conviction at trial. Following a plea of guilty the standard non parole period is nevertheless a reference point for sentencing purposes (see R. v. Way [2004] NSWCCA 131). While I am prepared to accept that the present offence was committed with little planning, it continued over a relatively lengthy period of time and involved the victim being tied up and on a number of occasions, the victim was physically attacked with a metal bar and at one stage with a sharp object resulting in the infliction of a number of injuries on the victim. I am satisfied that the present offence falls at the upper end of the middle range of objective seriousness for such offences.

I am not satisfied that any of the offender's subjective circumstances, including his intellectual limitations, whether considered individually or in combination, gives rise to any of the considerations referred to in R. v. Helmsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at paras. 33 to 36.

36His Honour then indicated that he allowed a 25 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the early plea, confirmed that he was satisfied that the applicant's expressions of remorse were genuine, and ""in order to reflect totality of criminality"" backdated the sentence to 20th June 2009 to give effect to what he regarded as the need for partial accumulation. His Honour found special circumstances for the purpose of s.44(2) Crimes Sentencing (Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), consisting of the applicant's institutionalisation, the need for extended supervision on parole, and the partial accumulation. He recorded his reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period.

The submissions of the parties

37As I have said, Ms. C.T. Loukas SC, who appeared for the applicant, challenged the sentence passed on the applicant as being manifestly excessive. Ms. Loukas acknowledged the limitations of this ground of appeal by reference to Markarian v. The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370 - 371 [27]; Wong v. The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 605 [58]; Hili v. The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538 [59] - 539 [60]. To make good the ground, she argued that manifest injustice was demonstrated because the sentence imposed was outside the bounds of a sound discretionary range.

38Acknowledging that consistency is not demonstrated by, and does not require, numerical equivalence, she relied upon a table of 23 cases which she argued demonstrated her main proposition. In particular she laid emphasis upon Henry v. R. [2007] NSWCCA 90 as being closely comparable. In that case, a 35 year old was re-sentenced by the Court of Criminal Appeal after a successful crown appeal to a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months with an additional term of 2 years and 3 months. She argued that the similarities between the present offender and the offender in Henry, and their offences, required the imposition of a lighter sentence here.

39The Crown Prosecutor, argued that the authorities referred to presented an insuperable barrier to the applicant in this case. He laid particular emphasis upon Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v. De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [303] - [305] per Simpson J, approved by the High Court in Hili at 537 [54]. The Crown said the Court could not be satisfied that a sentence other than that passed by the sentencing judge was warranted in law.

Decision

40I accept the Crown's submissions that the outcome of the present appeal is governed by the dictum of Simpson J in De La Rosa at [303] - [305], which I set out in full:

A history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. Such a history does not establish that that range is the correct range, nor that either the upper or the lower limit is the correct upper and lower limit. Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts

But it would be a mistake to regard an established range as fixing the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence. To take that attitude would be, de facto, to substitute judicial selection of sentences in individual cases for the boundaries of sentencing for a particular offence laid down by Parliament. In this case, that range is from 0 to 25 years. Of course, it is well established that the maximum sentence is reserved for the most serious cases. It is equally well established that it would be an extraordinary proposition that a person convicted of an offence of importing prohibited drugs would escape any custodial penalty. The point I am making is that the ranges of sentences actually imposed, while illuminating, are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence. But it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that ""unifying principles"" may be discerned: (citation omitted). 

In the end, the sentencing discretion is individual: it must be exercised by the individual judge, in respect of the individual offender. Significant sentencing considerations include the role played by the offender in the particular importation or enterprise, the quantity of the drug involved, and its estimated street or wholesale value (having regard, inter alia, where relevant, to its purity). Also of considerable significance are the character andantecedents of the offender (s 16A(2)(m)). This last consideration bears upon the offender's prospects of rehabilitation, and also to any claim for leniency made on his or her behalf by reason of prior good character. (Emphasis added).

41It needs to be borne in mind that this statement of principle, like those in Wong and Hili, were made in the exercise of federal jurisdiction. In the state jurisdiction, s.8 Judicial Officers Act 1986 (NSW) renders information, including reports, about sentencing disseminated by the Judicial Commission a relevant consideration to be taken into account in the interests of consistency. This statutory consideration may, therefore, extend the use which may be made of statistics and comparable sentences in the exercise of state jurisdiction. But strict limits remain. As Simpson J said in the extract above, sentencing is peculiarly individual: ""It must be exercised by the individual judge, in respect of the individual offender"". And, of course, in respect of the particular offending. As the High Court pointed out in Muldrock v. The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 132 [29], the sentencing task requires the judge to:

identify fully the facts, matters and circumstances which the judge concludes bear upon the judgment that is reached about the appropriate sentence to be imposed

42Moreover, as the plurality pointed out in Hili at 539 [60], ""what reveals manifest excess"", or inadequacy, of sentence is a consideration by the appellate court of all the matters that are relevant to fixing the sentence. The detection of manifest error is not ""fundamentally intuitive"". 

43I also bear in mind the basic rule stated in Lowndes v. The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671 - 2 [15]:

...a court of criminal appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion.

44I am unable to see that the helpful comparative information provided by the applicant demonstrates that the sentence passed on the applicant is plainly unjust. Necessarily, it is impossible for the Court to closely examine all of these cases in an attempt to distil a guiding principle, or guiding principles, in relation to this category of offence by which the appropriateness of the sentence passed may be measured. Given the fact sensitive nature of the sentencing task, even a close examination of the various sentences passed for offences falling into the same legal category, provided by a group of cases said to be comparable, can but rarely prove decisive. Naturally, when taken together, a group of cases said to be like will produce a numerical range; and sometimes this effect will be useful, even very useful. But the only true range, as Simpson J said, is the range fixed by Parliament. The principle of consistency calls for consistency of approach, not, as was said in Hili, numerical equivalence.

45Having regard to all the facts, matters and circumstances that the sentencing judge considered appropriate to the individual sentencing task before him, as I have set out above, I cannot detect even latent error. A review of his reasons does not suggest that: the matters considered were not appropriate; other appropriate matters were overlooked; he was mistaken about the facts found; or that he made any error of principle. It may be that greater weight could have been given to the consideration of the applicant's lack of education, intellectual difficulties or personality dysfunction: Muldrock at 137 [50] - 139 [55]. This may have led to a diminution of the significance of the considerations of general deterrence and retribution which his Honour emphasised, but not necessarily: R. v. Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68 and 71. Moreover, such considerations, to the extent to which they suggest the applicant is dangerous, at least when drug and alcohol affected, may have brought the need for protection of society into sharper focus to the same overall effect: his Honour was unable to find that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend. Mere questions of weight, or emphasis, do not readily fit the House v. R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 template. His Honour did refer to these considerations in his assessment of the facts, and also in the conclusions I have set out in full above ([32]). That I may have weighed them differently is not to the point.

46I am not satisfied that the applicant's proposed ground of appeal has been made good. The sentence imposed was within the range reasonably open at first instance. I am not of the opinion that another sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed.

47The orders I propose are:

(1)Leave to appeal granted;

(2)Appeal dismissed.

2761418,Kennedy v R [2013] NSWCCA 104,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with the orders and reasons of Fullerton J.

2FULLERTON J: On 18 July 2011 the applicant entered pleas of guilty in the District Court to two counts, each of which was laid contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, alleging that between 7 October 2009 and 18 November 2009 she knowingly took part in the manufacture of prohibited drugs. The first count concerned a quantity of methamphetamine in an amount not less than the commercial quantity which attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 25 years and for which a standard non-parole period of 10 years applies. The second count concerned a quantity of MDMA (or ecstasy) in an amount not less than a large commercial quantity attracting a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life for which a standard non-parole period of 15 years applies.

3By reason of the late pleas of guilty a ten per cent discount of sentence was allowed. 

4On 23 February 2012 the applicant was sentenced to 7 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 months on the first count, and imprisonment for 10 months with a non-parole period of 3 months on the second count. The sentences were partially accumulated resulting in an effective sentence of 12 months with a non-parole period of 5 months. Two offences on a Form 1 were taken into account in the sentence imposed on the second count. The first offence related to her possession of cannabis and the second her possession of a tablet press. 

5The sentence on the first count was ordered to date from 5 November 2011 to account for a period of three months and 18 days of pre-sentence custody following the applicant's arrest on 17 November 2009. She was released to conditional bail on 6 March 2010. Structured in this way the non-parole period for the first count expired on 4 February 2012, being three weeks before the sentencing hearing. Because of the order for partial accumulation, the sentence imposed on the second count was ordered to date from 5 January 2012. This necessitated that the applicant enter into custody to serve the balance of the effective non-parole period - a term of 5 weeks and 16 days.

6On 8 March 2012, the applicant was granted conditional bail by Adamson J pending the determination of her application for leave to appeal the sentence. Her Honour was satisfied that given the length of the sentence that remained to be served (a period of just over four weeks by the time the application was heard), her appeal would be rendered nugatory were she not released to bail. 

The facts for sentencing purposes 

7The Crown case on sentence, as reflected in the agreed statement of facts and as adopted by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence, was that the applicant's knowing participation in the manufacture of the drugs, the subject of both counts, was on the basis that she leased the premises where her co-offender (her partner of some years) was engaged in the manufacture of the drugs and that, as lessee of the premises, she suffered or permitted him to do so. Although the agreed facts included the evidence of a forensic chemist that a medium sized clandestine laboratory was in full operation in a shed on the leased premises at the time of the execution of the search warrant in November 2009, and that in his assessment at least 250g of methylamphetamine and 500g of ecstasy had been manufactured from the very considerable quantities of a precursor and other chemicals that were seized during the execution of the warrant, it was not the Crown case that the applicant performed any active role in the manufacturing process nor that she stood to gain financially or beneficially from the on-supply of the drugs manufactured. 

8In further elaboration of what the sentencing judge should be understood to have been satisfied was the applicant's limited role as a participant in her partner's illicit drug activity, his Honour made it clear in his sentencing remarks that he accepted her evidence that she signed the lease on the premises on 8 October 2009 because she was in paid employment and had a proven credit history; that she moved into the residential part of the leased property with her partner a couple of weeks later; that she only discovered the clandestine laboratory in the shed a week after that (and within four weeks her arrest); and that her partner directed her to stay away from the shed after her discovery. (His Honour noted that this was consistent with the evidence given by her co-offender.) 

The applicant's subjective circumstances 

9The applicant's subjective circumstances, were reflected in a pre-sentence report dated 26 September 2011, a detailed report from a forensic psychologist dated 22 February 2012 and her evidence on sentence. They included the fact that she had smoked cannabis recreationally since aged 18 but that she had never used ""hard drugs"". His Honour also accepted that following her arrest she has been totally abstinent from illicit drugs. 

10She was aged 36 at the time of the offending and 39 at the time of sentence. She had no relevant criminal record. She was born and educated in New Zealand to Year 10. Her parents separated when she was in her mid teens after which her mother moved to Western Australia. She has worked since leaving school in a range of vocations including setting up a music store which she operated for ten years in New Zealand before moving to Australia at age 27 to reconcile with her mother. Upon learning that her father was terminally ill she returned to New Zealand to care for him. He died ten months later. After returning to Australia, and prior to her arrest, she worked for a fishing company and in the hospitality industry. She was working in a restaurant at the time of her arrest. After being released to bail she returned to full-time work in the hospitality industry for over twelve months before securing work as a supervisor at Sydney Coach Terminal in Haymarket were she was earning a substantial income. She held this position at the time of sentence. 

11The psychologist reported that the applicant suffered from an anxiety disorder and depression (noted clinically and confirmed through appropriate psychometric testing) as features of a complex clinical history, which was characterised by estrangement from her mother at an early age, the death of her father and consistent themes of depression, anxiety and low self-esteem with her symptoms aggravated by the substantial change in her life circumstances following her arrest and the pending sentence proceedings. His Honour noted that the applicant reported strong memories of her time on remand and that she was fearful of a return to custody. 

12It was in this context that his Honour made reference to the applicant's psychological frailty, including what was identified as a risk of suicide. He also noted that in the opinion of the psychologist the applicant would benefit from cognitive behavioural therapy (administered in a clinical context) and that with continuing support, supervision and treatment her prognosis was positive. His Honour also acknowledged that the author of the pre-sentence report considered it unlikely that the applicant would require or benefit from supervision from the Probation and Parole Service since there appeared, on her assessment, to be no criminogenic factors at play. His Honour accepted that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were sound and that she was unlikely to reoffend in the future. He did not comment adversely upon the psychologist's view that her remorse was genuine. 

The sentencing decision 

13In light of her subjective circumstances his Honour considered that personal deterrence had little, if any, significance for sentencing purposes. He did, however, regard the offending as objectively serious and that general deterrence and punishment were of particular importance. He noted the need for the sentence to accord with the principles in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.

14In the result, while accepting that the applicant's role as a participant in her partner's drug activity was as reflected in the agreed facts and as supplemented by her evidence, his Honour regarded the objective seriousness of the offences as warranting nothing other than the imposition of full-time custodial sentences. He went on to find that ""alternatives to full-time custody were not capable of reflecting the objective seriousness of the present offences"". 

15Despite the applicant's counsel urging upon his Honour an approach to sentence which would not result in the applicant being returned to custody, in particular because of her clinical profile and her established and sustained rehabilitation over the two years since her arrest, it would appear that his Honour resolved to factor in the weight of both factors by reducing the sentences of imprisonment on both counts and altering the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term to provide for a period of supervision on parole. He came to that view despite the views of the Probation and Parole Service that supervision by the service was unlikely to be of any benefit and the assessment of the forensic psychologist that a clinical treatment program, including psychotherapy, was strongly recommended. He also ordered that the report of the clinical psychologist, which highlighted the risk of suicide, accompany the applicant's warrant of commitment.

The appeal 

16Although the applicant relied upon two grounds of appeal they were dealt with together in counsel's written submissions. At the hearing of the appeal those grounds effectively merged into a single ground, namely that the sentencing judge's discretion miscarried when imposing a sentence of full-time custody on the second count in circumstances where, as a result of the structure of the sentence, the lengthy period of discontinuous custody pending sentence and the need to back-date the sentence had resulted in the non-parole period on the first count having been served at the time of sentence and where the effective term remaining to be served was less than six weeks. It was submitted that having regard to the purposes of sentencing in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, it was an erroneously inflexible approach to the sentencing exercise to reject an alternative to full-time custody by reference solely to the objective circumstances of the offending. 

17The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence are provided for in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as follows: 
(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c) to protect the community from the offender,

(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.

18In Muldrock at [20] consideration was given to the statutory purposes of sentence in s 3A in the context of the common law as follows:
It should also be noted that the introduction of standard non-parole periods was accompanied by the incorporation of a statutory statement of the purposes of sentencing. The purposes there stated are the familiar, overlapping and, at times, conflicting, purposes of criminal punishment under the common law. There is no attempt to rank them in order of priority and nothing in the Sentencing Act to indicate that the court is to depart from the principles explained in Veen v R (No 2) in applying them. 

19In Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said in their joint judgment at 476: 
...sentencing is not a purely logical exercise, and the troublesome nature of the sentencing discretion arises in large measure from unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of the purposes of punishment. The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions...

20In the circumstances of this case the learned sentencing judge was confronted with a difficult sentencing decision with the principles of sentencing clearly pointing in opposite directions. Whilst general deterrence and the objective seriousness of the applicant's participation in the manufacture of large quantities of illicit drugs (albeit limited to being the lessee of premises) carried weight, the countervailing weight of the applicant's subjective circumstances was considerable. In my view, in combination, they did not sound in the need for the sentence to address the protection of the community or her rehabilitation or, in a practical sense, to make her accountable for her offending by the punishment inherent in a return to custody. 

21While I am in no doubt that his Honour was acutely aware of the need for the sentence on both counts to reflect a combination of competing sentencing objectives, and while I accept that it was within his Honour's sentencing discretion to conclude that no other penalty than sentences of imprisonment were called for, I am persuaded, in the particular circumstances of this case, that the structure of the sentences, which resulted in a sentencing order requiring the applicant's return to full-time custody for less than six weeks, was productive of discretionary error and that an order for suspension of the balance of the effective sentence ought to have been made. 

22The Crown's written submissions sought to defend the sentences although, at the hearing of the appeal, the Crown quite properly conceded the force of the applicant's submission that his Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried in the ultimate sentencing order, and that the purposes of punishment in this case were adequately addressed by invoking the operation of s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

Resentencing

23Two affidavits were relied upon by the applicant on sentence, an affidavit affirmed by the applicant on 6 May 2013 and an affidavit from her solicitor of 3 May 2013.

24The applicant's affidavit details her experience on return to custody complicated by her being informed that she was seven weeks pregnant after returning a positive screening test on reception into the prison system. She was placed on suicide watch. The pregnancy has been terminated at her request. The affidavit from her instructing solicitor annexes Justice Health records which confirm this account. 

25Her employment with Sydney Coach Terminal was terminated upon her return to custody despite the assurance of her employers that her position would be available to her at the expiration of the non-parole period. After some months following her release to bail pending the appeal she found work as a casual barmaid. Two weeks prior to the appeal she suffered an injury to her left hand requiring extensive suturing and immobilisation in a splint. Although this has prevented her from returning to work she has enough funds saved to ensure she is in a position to pay her rent until she is able to resume work. 

26During the course of her conditional bail pending the hearing of the appeal she complied strictly with reporting conditions each Tuesday and Thursday. There is no suggestion that she did not prosecute her appeal with due diligence. She has attended upon a clinical psychologist who referred her to a psychiatrist at Westmead Hospital where she is receiving treatment. 

27In my view, in all the circumstances of this case, including but not limited to the applicant's rehabilitation and what I am satisfied is the unlikelihood of reoffending in light of her overall subjective circumstances, it is appropriate to invoke the operation of s12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I am also satisfied that the contingent liability to detention were she to breach the terms of the sentencing order does not operate at the expense of the principles of deterrence, retribution and denunciation but in recognition of them.

28Given the statutory restraint in s 12(2) upon imposing a suspended sentence where an offender is subject to some other sentence of imprisonment (as is the case here by reason of the fact that the applicant was not formally released to parole following the expiration of the non-parole period imposed on the first count), and in order to ensure that on re-sentence the overall criminality as reflected in the charges on indictment (and the Form 1) is encompassed by the sentencing order, the orders I propose are as follows:

1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. The sentences imposed in the District Court on 23 February 2012 are quashed.

3. In lieu the following sentences are imposed:

(a) For the offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months to commence on the 5 November 2011 and to expire on 4 February 2012;

(b) For the offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, imprisonment for a period of 10 months to commence from 7 May 2013 to be suspended in accordance with s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act on condition that the applicant enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 10 months.

4. The order made in the District Court for the destruction of the prohibited drugs the subject of the offences specified on the Form 1 is confirmed.

29CAMPBELL J: I agree with Fullerton J.

2761436,Christian v R [2013] NSWCCA 98,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Davies J.

2DAVIES J: The Appellant was found guilty by a jury on 25 November 2011 on a charge of having supplied a prohibited drug namely 1,4- Butanediol. The supply was a deemed supply pursuant to s 29 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 because the quantity of the drug (84.4g) was more than a trafficable quantity. The trafficable quantity is 30g. 

3The Appellant appeals on the following grounds:

Ground 1: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the admission into evidence of the applicant's possession at the time of his arrest of a small brown bottle found to contain 1,4-Butanediol ('the small brown bottle');

Ground 2: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by:

a. the reliance by the Crown as part of its case on the applicant's possession at the time of his arrest of the small brown bottle;

b. the absence of adequate directions as to how the evidence of the applicant's possession of the small brown bottle might properly be used.

Ground 3: The verdict of the jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

The facts

4The Appellant is a boxing trainer and manager conducting the bulk of his work activities in Perth where he lives. 

5On 10 March 2009 he arrived early in the morning in Sydney from Perth to attend a fight on Wednesday 11 March involving a person he had previously trained and/or managed, and to accompany a then current client to a fight in which that person was involved on Friday 13 March. 

6The Appellant went to the Sheraton on the Park without a prior booking and obtained a room at 7:31am on 10 March 2009. As was customary, he was issued with two electronic cards to the room. He told the person at reception that he needed to sleep having arrived on the overnight flight from Perth.

7Later that afternoon he purchased two ""Mandarin Duck"" brand bags at World Square.

8The following day he went to Norton Street Leichhardt to have lunch with a person at the Grappa restaurant. As it happened that other person was under police surveillance. By reason of that the Appellant was followed when he concluded the lunch and ultimately drove in a taxi to Oxford Street, Paddington. 

9After coming out of a shop in Paddington he re-entered the taxi which had waited for him. A short distance later the taxi was pulled over by the police at 3:30pm. The Appellant was searched and in his possession was found a small brown bottle containing a fluid. When asked by the police what was in the bottle he said it was adrenaline. When asked why he had it he told the police that he trained fighters and used it to put on their cuts. It is accepted that adrenaline can be used in that way to inhibit bleeding. 

10Police also found cash in an amount of about $4000 in the Appellant's possession and a Sheraton Hotel access card. The Appellant denied that the access card was his, telling the police that he was staying at a friend's gym in Campbelltown and that he had never stayed at the Sheraton Hotel. 

11Not only was it untrue that he was not staying at the Sheraton Hotel at that time but he had stayed at the Sheraton on a number of occasions in the past. 

12He was arrested and taken to Surry Hills Police Station. He was released at about 8:00pm that night. He then returned to the Hotel. He apparently requested and was given another access card. However, when he endeavoured to gain access to his room he found that the police were in the process of executing a search warrant. 

13Items seized by the police when executing the search warrant included a Frantelle water bottle containing a yellow liquid, two resealable plastic bags containing a crystalline substance (subsequently determined to be 2.25g of methylamphetamine), a bong and a glass smoking pipe.

14The methylamphetamine, the bong and the glass smoking pipe were all in a Samsonite suitcase which had a Virgin Airlines tag attached to it with the Appellant's name on it. The Frantelle bottle containing the yellow liquid together with a Citibank Visa debit card in the Appellant's name were found in a smaller black shoulder type bag. 

15Both the liquid in the small brown bottle (found on the Appellant when searched in Paddington) and the liquid in the Frantelle bottle were later found to be I,4-Butanediol otherwise often known as GHB. 

16The Crown led evidence of the events of the afternoon of 11 March 2009 including the finding of the small brown bottle and the subsequent analysis of its contents. 

17The Appellant gave evidence at the trial. He denied that the Frantelle bottle and its contents belonged to him. He maintained his assertion that he believed that what was contained in the small brown bottle was adrenaline and that he had brought it from Perth for his client who was to fight on the Friday night. He intended giving it to him on the Wednesday evening at the fight and that was why it was in his bag that afternoon. He was not going back to the hotel but was going directly to Campbelltown where the fight was to take place.

18He said that a former client of his, Daniel Rowsell, had stayed with him at the hotel in his room. He said that he allowed him to do so because Mr Rowsell was then a drug addict who had no place of his own. 

19He said that Mr Rowsell arrived at the hotel with his clothes in plastic bags. The Appellant gave to Mr Rowsell the Samsonsite suitcase he had brought from Perth. That was why he, the Appellant, had purchased new bags on the Tuesday afternoon. 

20He said that when he returned to the hotel on the Tuesday afternoon after purchasing the bags he saw the methylamphetamine and the drug paraphernalia. He realised that it belonged to Mr Rowsell and, accordingly, he put it in the Samsonsite suitcase. It was because of the presence of those drugs that he lied to the police the following afternoon. He thought that if he admitted that he was staying at the Sheraton Hotel they would search the room and find the drugs. That would either lead to problems for him or problems for Mr Rowsell.

21Mr Rowsell also gave evidence. He said that he became involved with drugs after his boxing career finished at the end of 2003. He became addicted to drugs. He was using GHB heavily as well as ice ""to keep going"".

22There was corroborating evidence from hospital records showing the number of times that Mr Rowsell had been admitted to Accident & Emergency by reason of GBH overdoses. There was no challenge to Mr Rowsell's evidence that he had been and was at the relevant time a drug addict and using GHB. 

23Mr Rowsell said that the Frantelle bottle and its contents, the ice and the drug paraphernalia all belonged to him. He said that he was responsible for GHB being in the small brown bottle because he had found the bottle and put that substance into it. He could not remember if the small brown bottle contained any liquid when he found it but said that if it did he would have emptied it. 

24Although Mr Rowsell had an incomplete memory of what he did on 10 and 11 March he remembered that he had used drugs, had at least one woman up to the room, tipped the GHB into the small brown bottle and had been alone in the room at various times when the Appellant was absent.

25Records from the hotel showed when the door to the room was opened on each occasion and by which access card that had been done. Ignoring the times that room was accessed by staff members for one reason or another the records disclosed the following:

10/03/09 7:39am Card 11283
10/03/09 12:46pm Card 11283
10/03/09 2:19pm Card 11283
10/03/09 4:53pm Card 394
10/03/09 5:51pm Card 394
10/03/09 6:15pm Card 394
10/03/09 9:16pm Card 394
11/03/09 2:06am Card 394
11/03/09 3:13am Card 11283
11/03/09 10:05pm Card 11283

These records suggest but do not prove that two persons rather than one were entering the hotel room at different times. At the very least it is known that the last entry recorded was made by Mr Rowsell, and that it was the Appellant who used Card 394 on the afternoon/evening of 10 March after he returned from purchasing the two new bags.

26It was never put to the Appellant nor to Mr Roswell that they had agreed on the account of events which they gave. 

Grounds 1 and 2: Admissibility of small brown bottle evidence
27The parties addressed arguments concerning these two grounds together. It is convenient to deal with them in that way. 

28It is important, first, to note a significant change during the course of the trial. The Crown relevantly opened to the jury describing the search of the Appellant in Paddington as follows:

The Accused was subsequently searched by Senior Constable Bastan and by Sergeant Singh and during the search of the brown bag a small, brown coloured bottle containing a yellow liquid was found, the Accused was asked what it was and he said, ""Its adrenalin."" The question, ""Why do you have it?"" he said, ""I train fighters and I use it to put on their cuts"". ... Subsequent analysis of this liquid identified the prohibited drug 1,4-butanediol with a weight of 23.49 grams. (emphasis added)

29When outlining the search at the Sheraton Hotel the Crown Prosecutor said:

The search was recommenced and a number of items were located and seized. Amongst them was a 250ml Frantelle bottle containing a liquid. This was inside a bag which also contained a City Bank (sic) card in the name of the Accused. Again this bottle was sealed and put in a bag and all the rest of it. It was subsequently analysed by an analyst and it was found to be again the drug Butanediol with a weight of 84.4g. This substance identical to the substance that was seized from the bag that the Accused had on him earlier in the day. (emphasis added)

30When Detective Symons first gave evidence he read his statement to the Court. In that statement he referred to the finding of the Frantelle bottle ""containing yellow liquid"". He then gave evidence that the liquid was sent away for testing but that the empty Frantelle bottle was at Court. 

31He also gave evidence of liquid being found in the small, brown bottle when the Appellant was arrested in Paddington. No description of the liquid was given. He said that that liquid was sent away for analysis also. 

32In cross-examination he was asked if he had any recollection about the appearance of the liquid in the small brown bottle but he said that he did not. 

33For reasons that were not made apparent Detective Symons was recalled and what was said to be further re-examination by the Crown Prosecutor took place. The following evidence was given including in some further cross-examination at the end of what was said to be re-examination:

Q. If I could show you this package? Is that the Frantelle bottle that was found in the room at the Sheraton Hotel in that little bag on top of the Samsonite bag? 
A. Yes.

Q. And most of the liquid's been taken out of it, correct?
A. Yes.

Q. For testing purposes and that sort of thing? 
A. That's right.

Q. But there is some residue in there? 
A. Yes.

Q. Tell me what colour it is?
A. I suppose you'd say like an off yellow.

Q. I think one of the officers, I think Officer Klotz I think may have described as lime, so yellowy lime? 
A. Yeah.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Could that be marked for identification your Honour?

MFI #7 FRANTELLE BOTTLE WITH YELLOWY LIME RESIDUE

Q. Then Officer, while we had the morning tea break, did you take out the bottle into which the material that was found in Mr Christian's shoulder bag was put into?
A. Yes.

Q. It had been take out of their containers in that shoulder bag and poured into another bottle? 
A. That's right.

Q. In the presence of Officer Klotz and myself and Mr Djemal did you pour some of that liquid into the top of that bottle? 
A. Yes.

Q. What colour was it?
A. Clear.

FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DJEMAL

Q. I don't think I'll, so just to be clear Officer have you got a copy of exhibit B there? If that could be given to you? 
A. Look I can see it from here.

Q. Exhibit B you've got the little bottle with the red lid on it there, that's the first picture there I think it's picture number 26. See that there? So the contents of that particular bottle is clear liquid is that right? 
A. Yes.

Q. Which was found on Mr Christian and obviously what's observable here on the same exhibit, photograph 30, the contents of that was a different colour as in yellow?
A. Yes.

34Immediately after that evidence a Statement of Agreed Facts was handed up and read to the jury. When that had been done the Crown Prosecutor announced that there was a further agreement ""between both parties that adrenaline is a clear liquid"". 

35This evidence represented a significant change in the case. By reason of the Crown's opening that the small, brown bottle contained yellow liquid the jury is likely to have concluded, until this evidence was given, that the liquid in the small brown bottle was from the same source as the liquid in the Frantelle bottle. The finding of the small brown bottle with that liquid in the possession of the Appellant would have been a significant piece of circumstantial evidence bearing on the issue of the possession of the Frantelle bottle. Indeed, the Crown had referred to the substance in the Frantelle bottle as being identical to the substance in the small brown bottle.

36In his closing address the Crown said nothing about the different liquids in the two bottles. He referred to the small brown bottle being found in the Appellant's possession when he was arrested and that it contained a prohibited drug. He referred to the evidence of the Appellant that he had brought adrenaline in the small brown bottle from Perth, and to Mr Rowsell's evidence of pouring some of his GHB into the small brown bottle. In relation to that the Crown wrongly referred to this evidence as Mr Rowsell having said that he rummaged through the Appellant's property to find the small brown bottle. The Crown used that to discredit Mr Rowsell by saying ""This is a mate ... rummaging through his property"". In fact Mr Rowsell said no such thing.

37Mr Rowsell gave the following evidence in chief:

Q. Did you ever see a bottle like that in room 624 while you were up there?
A. At the time I was there I didn't remember it, no. I remember it later when I took Craig's bags to him. 

Q. What did you remember?
A. I remembered him, he told me that he'd been arrested for something in a brown bottle and then it registered to me that I had put 1,4 in it.

Q. Was there anything in the bottle when you put 1, 4 in it?
A. At the time I don't remember if there was I tipped it out. It wasn't something that I wasn't really thinking about at the time I suppose.

38In cross-examination he gave this evidence about that matter:

Q. Just want to go back, you said that you put some G into a bottle you saw in the room which had a stopper on it? 
A. Yeah.

Q. Was that out of the water bottle he'd bought the G in?
A. It could have been, could've been in another bottle, I'm not sure.

Q. How many bottles of G did you bring to the hotel? 
A. I - no idea at the time, I didn't know when I walked in. Later I'd realised I'd lost a substantial amount of G and then the bottle was clear that I had it in, the amphetamines I'd had. Later on I realised the brown bottle because I'd poured contents into it, that was it.

Q. You're not sure whether they came out of the bottle that had been shown to you, the drink bottle? 
A. They could've, I could've had another bottle.

Q. Could've had another bottle, what happened to that other bottle? 
A. I'm not sure.

Q. Leave it behind in the hotel?
A. I don't know maybe I did, I could've used it for anything, pour water in, I don't know.

Q. Could you have had three or four bottles of G with you? 
A. I could well have.

Q. What did G cost?
A. The amount that I had left, like I remember it because substantial to me was three days worth of drugs and that's what I've lost. When I went to the hotel room the one thing that I was thinking about going to gaol, was thinking about the police - the funny thing was - the thing worse to me was that I'd lost my drugs.

Q. Coming back to my question what did it cost you? 
A. Sorry, the G?

HIS HONOUR

Q. You were asked by the Crown how much did it cost? 
A. Yeah sorry mate, I'd say what was in that bottle was about two and $400 worth.

Q. How much was in the other bottle you might have taken with you? 
A. A hundred bucks worth.

Q. And there could have been two other bottles you had with you?
A. I - from what I remembered pouring into a brown bottle it could have been the remainder of a bottle that I had, that I'd carried but it was only a small amount.

Q. Didn't you know that was Mr Christian's bottle?
A. It didn't really - this time it didn't - there was no real care factor I guess, not care factor I appreciated things that people did for me but I was a drug addict I didn't think of consequences, I didn't -

Q. When you say you poured this liquid in did you know there was other liquid already in that bottle? 
A. I wouldn't have left any other liquid that was in a bottle, no.

Q. So if the bottle already liquid in it you would have poured it down a sink would you?
A. Yes I would have.

Q. Did you do that? 
A. I guess it did yes. 

Q. What do you mean you guess you did, did you or didn't you? 
A. Well that's what had happened so I guess I did.

Q. Why didn't you get a bottle out of the bathroom and rinse it out, put your G in that?
A. It was just there and was convenient.
Q. Hotels give an array of bottles for their guests don't they, shampoos, conditioners? 
A. I don't know it wasn't something that at the time that I thought about.

Q. Didn't you have a look around the room that you were staying in?
A. I'm not sure whether I looked around the room or whether I didn't.

39In his closing address counsel for the Appellant said this in relation to the small brown bottle:

The other things in the Samsonite bag, he's not charged with those, and I'll get to those, but we're here for the bottle. How do they link the bottle to him? And if they try - and I mean a lot's been made out of the brown dropper bottle which is exhibit B. Now if that was yellow, all right they've got some inferences there because they can infer and say well the bottle in his possession is the same colour liquid as the bottle that's in the other one and they'd have a line of reasoning. It's a different colour. So that alone says no connection. It's not the same.

40A little later in the address counsel for the Appellant said in passing:

The little bottle, not the same colour, ...

41The Trial Judge provided detailed, written directions about important matters to the jury. In the course of those the following appeared:

This case is concerned with the alleged possession of the substance found in the hotel room, referred to the analyst's certificate exhibit E ""Item 2"". The Accused's alleged possession of a smaller quantity of the same substance, is relevant as one of several circumstances or ""facts"" upon which the prosecution relies to invite you to draw the inference of intentional possession of the quantity of the prohibited drug found in the hotel room.

...

You are not to reason, if you so find, he ""possessed"" the prohibited drug in the eye dropper (brown) bottle (photo 26, exhibit B), therefore he must have possessed the ""prohibited drug"" alleged to be in the ""Frantelle"" bottle in the hotel room. Further, I point out that he could not have possessed the prohibited drug in that brown bottle found when he was arrested if he believed it to contain adrenaline. 


42In his summing up the Judge made these remarks relevant to the issue of the small brown bottle:
You will have to, however, consider other matters: The Accused's responses to the police about what he believed was in the brown bottle when he was arrested - he said it was adrenaline; the Accused's assertion of the fact that he used it for cuts on fighter.

43A little later he said this:

This case is concerned with the alleged possession of the substance found in the hotel room, referred to in that certificate. The accused's alleged possession of a smaller quantity of the same substance is relevant as one of several circumstances or facts upon which the prosecution relies to invite you to draw the inference of intentional possession of the quantity of the prohibited drug found in the hotel room. However, you will bear in mind the submissions made about this matter by both parties. You will bear in mind, for example, the different appearance of the liquid in the two bottles, and the accused's evidence as to his reason for having the brown bottle.

I point out to you that, even if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the accused did possess the prohibited drug in the manner I have described to you as a matter of law in the 'brown bottle', you should not reason ""Ah, because he supplied that quantity in the sense of had it in his possession, that must mean he had a tendency to supply the other quantity"". That does not follow. You cannot use his possession, if you are so satisfied - that is intentional control, of the prohibited drug within the brown bottle - as establishing that he intentionally possessed the bottle that was found in the hotel room. It is relied upon for a limited purpose - that is it is one of the number of circumstances pointed to by the prosecution as establishing the accused's guilt. If the accused believed that what was in his possession when he was arrested was adrenaline, or that belief on his part is a reasonable possibility, his possession of that quantity of the substance will not assist you in determining whether he knew the substance in the room was a prohibited drug. In fact, it might assist you in concluding that it is a reasonable possibility that at least that he did not know of the prohibited drug in the room.

You are not to reason, if you so find he possessed the prohibited drug in the eye-dropper bottle, therefore he must have possessed the prohibited drug alleged to be in the Frantelle bottle in the hotel room. Further, I point out that he could not have possessed the prohibited drug in that brown bottle found when he was arrested if he believed it to contain adrenaline. It would obviously not be a case of him possessing the prohibited drug, because he had a belief that it was adrenaline, not a prohibited drug. (emphasis added) 
44It is apparent from that last passage that the Trial Judge informed the jury that the evidence was not to be used as tendency evidence. Indeed, the Crown did not put the evidence forward as tendency evidence. However, it is not apparent how the evidence could be used other than as tendency evidence. Certainly, the jury were not told how they could use the evidence. 

45The Crown at first contended that the evidence about the small, brown bottle was contextual evidence, but submitted orally that the better description was circumstantial evidence. The Crown submitted that it was highly probative evidence that added to the improbability that the Appellant did not know of the Frantelle bottle in the hotel room. The Crown submitted that it tended to establish that the Appellant was engaged in a criminal enterprise and increased the probability that he had sole possession of the Frantelle bottle.

46Labelling the evidence in a particular way (contextual or circumstantial or relationship) does not really advance an understanding of its admissibility. Rather, the issue of its admissibility is to be determined by an analysis of its relevance: R v Quach [2002] NSWCCA 519 at [7]-[8].

47To be relevant the evidence had to be evidence that ""could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding"". The fact in issue was whether the Appellant was in possession of the prohibited drug in the Frantelle bottle found in the hotel room. It might have been arguable, if the liquid in the small brown bottle was the same liquid as was found in the Frantelle bottle, that evidence of the liquid in the small brown bottle was relevant to the issue of whether or not the Appellant was in possession of the Frantelle bottle. That is likely to be the reason that the Crown opened the case in the way that it did and led evidence of the finding of the small brown bottle with its liquid and the subsequent results of the analysis of that liquid. 

48The Crown submitted that evidence of the liquid in the small brown bottle was admissible because it was the same drug and the same liquid as was found in the Frantelle bottle, because it went to the issue of the Appellant's denial of his occupancy of the hotel room and because it was relevant to rebut a suggestion that the drug in the room was in his possession for his own use.

49However, where the only connection between the two lots of liquid was that both contained the same prohibited drug, the evidence would only be admissible, if at all, as tendency evidence. The liquid was not the same liquid. Where the defence opened, not on the basis that the drug in the Frantelle bottle was for the Appellant's personal use but that the issue was in whose possession it was (with Mr Rowsell's name being mentioned), evidence concerning the liquid in the small brown bottle could not have been admitted to rebut an anticipated suggestion that the drug in the Frantelle bottle was for personal use. This was reinforced by what had been said to the trial judge in the absence of the jury and before the opening addresses. Counsel for the Appellant expressly said that he was ""not running personal use"" - rather, the issue was whether he possessed it in the room.

50In R v Vincent Yiu Chen Fung [2002] NSWCCA 479; (2002) 136 A Crim R 95 the accused was arrested in possession of a backpack. The backpack contained a green garbage bag with four smaller packages in it, each of which was wrapped and sealed with adhesive tape. The packaging was distinctive. Inside those packages was a quantity of heroin having a gross weight of 3.519 kilograms. The accused's case was that he had no idea what was in the backpack. He had been asked by a friend to deliver it to another person. 

51The Crown led evidence at the trial, over the objection of the defence, that the accused had a close relationship with the person who asked him to deliver the bag including evidence of a number of intercepted telephone conversations between them from which it could be inferred that there was an arrangement about the delivery of the bag, and also evidence that that person and another member of his family had been found in possession of heroin packaged in a similar way to that found in the backpack.

52Sully J (with whom Beazley JA agreed) examined the evidence that was given concerning the similar packaging of the heroin and said:

[45] In my opinion, a fair reading of the passages quoted from the evidence of these two Crown witnesses does not convince that the evidence, if accepted at its highest point in favour of the Crown, was capable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the packaging of the heroin seized on 20 June, when compared with the packaging of the heroin seized subsequently in September, was so distinctive that any heroin found packaged in that fashion could be sourced back to either or both of the Lams. That consideration, alone, would be sufficient, in my opinion, to demonstrate that the materials categorised as B, C and D in the statement of Ground 1 were not relevant to proof of the issue of relevant knowledge in the appellant as at 20 June. I observe that, as best the fact can be judged from the available trial transcript, there was no application for a hearing on the voir dire in order to test the admissibility of this particular evidence. It would have been, as I respectfully think, appropriate for the learned trial Judge to have taken evidence on the voir dire in order to determine the admissibility of the challenged evidence. Had that course been followed, and had there been elicited on the voir dire the evidence that came subsequently to light in the trial proper, then the learned trial Judge would have been assisted much better than in fact happened, in coming to a properly reasoned conclusion about the relevance of the particular material.

53The categories referred to in that extract were set out in the judgment at [29] as follows:

The Appeal against Conviction: Ground 1

The Ground is:

""The learned trial judge erred in allowing ""relationship evidence"" to be admitted in the form of:

A. Times and duration of telephone calls between the appellant and Mr. Michael Lam and Mr. Sik Lam

B. Evidence of the surveillance and arrest of Mr. Michael and Mr. Sik Lam for supplying heroin on occasions subsequent to the alleged supply by the appellant.

C. Evidence of similar packaging and method of supply by Mr. Michael and Mr. Sik Lam on subsequent occasions.

D. Evidence of the similarity of the three heroin seizures.""

54In the same way, once the evidence in the present case disclosed that the liquid in the small brown bottle was clear liquid and that the liquid in the Frantelle bottle was yellow, it could not be established beyond reasonable doubt that the liquid in the small brown bottle was the same as the liquid in the Frantelle bottle. It was not, therefore, relevant to proof of the matter of possession by the Appellant of the Frantelle bottle except, arguably, as tendency evidence.

55In R v Ngatikaura [2006] NSWCCA 161; (2006) 161 A Crim R 329 the Respondent was arraigned on a charge of supplying heroin on 3 November 2004. The supply charge was based on the deeming provisions in s 29 and arose from the police finding on the execution of a search warrant at her home 5.74g of heroin, more than $5000 in cash and other items associated with the supply of heroin. 

56On a pre-trial application the Crown sought to have admitted into evidence two earlier offences of supply of heroin committed by the Respondent to which he entered pleas of guilty. These offences were committed on 28 September 2004 and 20 October 2004. The Trial Judge refused to admit the evidence and an appeal was brought under s 5F Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against rejection of the evidence.

57The evidence had been put forward by the Crown not as tendency or propensity evidence but ""simply evidence that shows that at that relevant time, that around the time of the deemed supply, that she was engaged in the business of supplying heroin"". 

58Simpson J said:
[66] Because the Crown disclaimed any reliance upon s97, no notice of the kind referred in subs(1)(a) was given. That may, for the moment, be put to one side. S97 does not necessarily preclude the admission of any evidence that shows that an accused person has committed another crime, or has a tendency or disposition or propensity to commit a crime whether of a specific or general nature: see Harriman; Sultana; R v Cornwell [2003] NSWSC 97; 57 NSWLR 82; R v Quach [2002] NSWCCA 519. S97 precludes the admission of the evidence (unless it overcomes the test imposed by subs(1)(b)) where it is tendered for that purpose; where it is tendered for another purpose, such as those mentioned in the authorities I have cited, even where it also incidentally proves criminal disposition or tendency, it is not necessarily rendered inadmissible, although it would then be necessary to give consideration to s95 of the Evidence Act, and to give the jury appropriate directions. 

[67] It is, of course, necessary precisely to analyse the manner in which the Crown would seek to use the evidence. That was disclosed clearly in the argument, both in the District Court and on appeal - it was expressed as tendered to prove that the respondent was a drug dealer. 

[68] I am (with respect to Beazley JA who takes a different view) quite unable to see that this evidence was tendered for any reason other than to prove that the respondent had a tendency to deal in drugs. Even if it were to be said that the evidence was tendered to rebut the respondent's anticipated defence, that the drugs and other items were the property of her husband, and that their presence within the home was not within her knowledge, nevertheless that rebuttal was to be achieved by showing that she had a tendency to supply and deal in drugs. This, in my opinion, emerges quite clearly from the responses given by the Crown Prosecutor on the appeal. Evidence of the respondent's previous drug dealings was tendered to show that she was in possession of the drugs the subject of the present charge; the evidence of her previous drug dealings would help to establish her guilt of the present charge because it would show that she had a tendency so to behave. 

[69] That, to my mind, does not necessarily render the evidence inadmissible. It simply means that the appropriate procedures had to be followed and the necessary tests applied. I outlined these in R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338 at [33] and [45].

59Her Honour went on to say that if consideration had to be given to the evidence as tendency evidence regard would need to be had to s 101 Evidence Act 1995 and ss 135 and 137 would be immaterial.
60Rothman J (who agreed with Simpson J) said this:

[77] In this case, the Crown seeks to tender evidence which it says is not being adduced to prove tendency. In other words, the Court is not faced with the issue of whether the evidence satisfies s.97 of the Act, but rather whether s.97 of the Act applies to exclude the evidence; i.e. is it tendency evidence? 

[78] Unless excluded by a specific provision of the Evidence Act, all relevant evidence is admissible: s.56 of the Act. It is relevant if it ""could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue in the proceeding"": s.55 of the Act. Probative value is the extent to which evidence is relevant. 

[79] Thus the first question that must be asked by any person seeking to adduce evidence is ""could the evidence rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the probability of the existence of a fact in issue?"" If the answer to that is in the affirmative, then, subject to exclusionary provisions, it is admissible. But s.97 is an exclusionary provision. It excludes tendency evidence unless the requirements of s.97 are satisfied. 

[80] Evidence of a tendency that a person has or had, to act in a particular way, or have a particular state of mind, in order to prove that the person did, at the point in time relevant to the issues before the Court, act in a particular way, or have a particular state of mind, is tendency evidence. It will be prohibited, notwithstanding that it is relevant, unless it satisfies s.97 (and in the case of a criminal proceeding, s.101) of the Act. 

[81] The question that must be asked in relation to such evidence, or indeed any evidence, when evaluating relevance, is precisely how it seeks to make more probable the existence of the fact in issue. If it affects, rationally, the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue by applying a reasoning process described in s.97 (""tendency reasoning""), it is inadmissible unless it has a significant probative value. Section 97 of the Evidence Act is engaged by the purpose and reasoning process, not its rational effect; 

""What is not to be admitted is a chain of reasoning and not necessarily a state of facts. If the inadmissible chain of reasoning be the only purpose for which the evidence is adduced as a matter of law, the evidence is not admissible."" (per Lord Hailsham in DPP v Boardman [1975] AC 421 at 453)

[82] One must be careful in applying pre-Evidence Act judgments to the admissibility of tendency evidence under the Evidence Act. However, the common law principles on such issues may be used as a guide in the evaluation of the admissibility of evidence, even under the Evidence Act. 

[83] The High Court in Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461 summarised the principles applicable, prior to the Evidence Act, in the following way: 

""Propensity evidence is not admissible if it shows only that the accused has a propensity or disposition to commit a crime or that he or she was the sort of person to commit the crime charged. ...It was also accepted that in order to be admissible, propensity evidence must possess 'a strong degree of probative force' or the probative force ... must clearly transcend the prejudicial effect of mere criminality or propensity."" (at pp 480-481) (The emphasis is my own)

[84] To a large degree the provisions of s.97 reflect the above passage from the joint judgment of their Honours Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ. Once the ""propensity"" or ""tendency"" reasoning process is involved, the prima facie position is that the evidence is inadmissible, unless it has a significant probative value. In other words, the reasoning process adopted must show something more than that the accused has a disposition to commit the crime or is the sort of person to commit the crime.

61His Honour went on to hold that the evidence sought to be adduced was tendency evidence and that it was inadmissible until the requirements of s 97 were satisfied.

62In my opinion, the position in the present case is stronger for the Appellant than that in either Fung or Ngatikaura. What was contained in the small, brown bottle could at best have come from a common source with what was contained in the Frantelle bottle but there was no evidence to support such an inference. What was clear is that it could not have come directly from the Frantelle bottle. The evidence about the liquid in the small brown bottle could only be evidence that the Appellant had a propensity or disposition or tendency to have in his possession that drug although there was no evidence to link it to the drug in the Frantelle bottle.

63If it was tendency evidence it is doubtful that its probative value could outweigh its prejudicial effect on the Appellant. That matter was never considered because there was no objection to the evidence being led. That was no doubt because of the Crown's opening and because it was not known until Detective Symons was recalled that the substance in the small brown bottle was not the same as the substance in the Frantelle bottle. 

64Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules, when viewed strictly, applies although at the time the evidence was led it was believed by all that the liquid was the same in both bottles. The Crown opened and led evidence that was later demonstrated to be wrong. If the evidence was admissible it was only admissible as tendency evidence. Not only was no notice served pursuant to s 97 but the Crown said on this appeal that the evidence was not put forward as tendency evidence. By reason of the opening and the leading of the evidence no balancing exercise was conducted either under s 101 (if it was tendency evidence) nor ss 135 and 137 (if it was not). 

65These matters have brought about a miscarriage of justice because the Appellant was deprived of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open to him: KBT v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 417 at 423-424; Baini v The Queen [2012] HCA 59; (2012) 87 ALJR 180 at [26] - [27]. The matter could not be corrected by directions from the Trial Judge although his Honour attempted to minimise the damage in what he said (set out at [43] above).

66The situation in which the Appellant found himself at the trial can be said to be relevantly the same as in Fung with Sully J saying:

[59] There is the further consideration that there is, in my opinion, a risk which is both real and unacceptable that the prejudicial effect of the wrongly admitted evidence unfairly influenced the verdict of the jury. It is true that the jury was given some direction by the learned trial Judge as to the impermissibility of a process of reasoning that is normally described as guilt by association. It seems to me, however, that the very nature of the evidence which was wrongly admitted entails a risk, real and unacceptable, not that the jury wilfully ignored the directions of the trial Judge, but that the subliminal impact of the wrongly admitted evidence might have had an influence that it ought not to have had. 

[60] For those reasons, I am of the opinion that there was, in the relevant statutory sense, a substantial miscarriage of justice by reason of the wrongful admission at trial of the evidence that I have been discussing in connection with Ground 1.

67In my opinion, grounds 1 and 2(a) are made out. In the ordinary course it would be appropriate to uphold the appeal on these grounds and to order a re-trial. It is necessary, however, to say something about Ground 3 which asserts that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable. If that was found it would be necessary to direct an acquittal.

Ground 3: Unreasonable verdict

68The Appellant submitted that, regardless of whether grounds 1 and 2 succeeded, the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence.

69The Appellant submitted that the Crown case as to possession was entirely circumstantial and relied on inferences of guilt from certain facts. The Crown had to prove, the Appellant submitted, that the Appellant had exclusive possession of the GHB in the Frantelle bottle. The Appellant submitted that it was not enough to show that the Appellant had hired the room in which the GHB was found nor was it sufficient that the bag in which it was found contained his credit card nor that the Samsonite bag near where it was located had a luggage tag bearing the Appellant's name. 

70The Appellant submitted that there was not only the possibility of another person having possession of the GHB there was also positive evidence from Mr Rowsell. That evidence tended to show that a person other than the Appellant had access to the room, that there were two key cards issued and that they were used at various times. In addition, there was undoubted evidence that Mr Rowsell was a drug addict who regularly used the prohibited drug found in the Frantelle bottle. 

71The Appellant drew attention to statements of principle in R v Amanatidis [2001] NSWCCA 400; (2001) 125 A Crim R 89 at [9] and Jackwitz v R; Franklin v R [2006] NSWCCA 419 at [34]. The Appellant also referred to the factual circumstances in a number of the cases including Amanatidis, R v Matthews [2004] NSWCCA 259; R v Filippetti (1978) 13 A Crim R 335; R v Burns (Court of Criminal Appeal, 19 August 1988, Unreported) and R v Bazley (Court of Criminal Appeal, 23 March 1989, Unreported) which he sought to use analogously.

72In my opinion it is not appropriate, in the light of the conclusions regarding grounds 1 and 2, to deal with arguments concerning whether or not the verdict was unreasonable. In Fung the Appellant argued as a further ground that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable. This Court determined that there had been a substantial miscarriage of justice by reason of the wrongful admission at trial of the evidence, to which reference has earlier been made (the similar packaging of the heroin and the association with the Lams). 

73In dealing with the ground based on an unreasonable verdict Sully J said:

[65] I do not think that it can be said that a properly presented Crown case, untainted by the wrongful admission of what I might call the Lam evidence, could not properly be left to a jury. I have quoted previously the summary contained in the Crown's written submissions of the circumstantial case, exclusive of the Lam evidence, upon which the Crown relied at the appellant's trial, and would presumably rely again at a re-trial. That circumstantial case seems to me to exhibit precisely that ""combination of suspicious circumstances and failure to make inquiry"" of which the High Court says plainly in Pereira that it ""may sustain an inference of knowledge of the actual or likely existence of the relevant matter"". No doubt, and as the High Court was particular to emphasise, great care needs to be taken in the way in which such a case is left to the jury by the presiding Judge; but that is a long way short of saying that such a case cannot properly be left at all for the consideration of the jury. 

[66] If that be a correct analysis, then it would not be appropriate, in my opinion, for this Court itself to pre-empt what might be done by a reasonable jury properly instructed at a properly conducted re-trial. 

[67] I, therefore, would not uphold Ground 8. In the result, I would quash the appellant's conviction and order a re-trial.

74The Crown case against the present Appellant was a circumstantial one. It required the jury to draw inferences and come to a view about whether or not they accepted the evidence of the Appellant and/or Mr Rowsell. Putting aside the evidence of the liquid that was found in the small brown bottle, it could not be said that a reasonable jury properly instructed could not convict the Appellant. 

75In those circumstances, ground 3 should not be upheld. There should be a new trial conducted in conformity to these reasons. 

Conclusion

76I propose the following orders:

1. Appeal allowed.
2. Quash the conviction of the Appellant.
3. Order a new trial.

77ADAMSON J: I agree with Davies J.

2761439,R v Pierre MOSS [2013] NSWDC 207,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1This is a case where a man in charge of a girls' football team abused his position by exchanging inappropriate and offensive text messages with one of the team members. He was in his thirties and she was a 12 year old girl.

2The man was arrested and charged by the police for his behaviour and he pleaded guilty. I have to sentence him today. The prosecution says I should impose a prison sentence and place him on a register for the protection of children. The defence says that I should give him a good behaviour bond and that the law about the register does not apply to his offence.

3Judges need to give reasons for sentences they impose so I need to explain my reasoning first. I will set out the charge then give some detail about the behaviour that brought it about. It is important for judges to take into account not only the crime and what happened but also the personal circumstances of the offender. In this case there is a good deal of psychological and psychiatric evidence about the offender.

4I will then assess the arguments of the prosecution and the defence and finally I will give my decision about the kind of sentence I will impose and whether or not to place the offender on the register, then I will announce the sentence itself.

5The man's name is Pierre Moss. He has pleaded guilty to an offence under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The offence is using a carriage service in such a way that reasonable persons would regard that use as being menacing, harassing, or offensive. The conduct is alleged to have occurred between 11 August and 29 August 2011. The maximum penalty for the offence that Mr Moss has pleaded guilty to is 3 years imprisonment. I formally convict Pierre Moss of that offence.

6Next I will give some detail about what Mr Moss did which brought about the charge. A very convenient summary occurs in the written submissions of Ms G E Wright of counsel who appeared for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. In [20] of those submissions, which are part of exhibit A, she described the crime in the following terms, which I quote

""The offending involved a large number of communications over more than two weeks. In the text messages, the offender was recorded as saying that he wished the child was 'way older' and that he wished she was his 'missus', referring to her on several occasions as 'gorgeous' and signing off numerous text messages with the 'x' sign to represent kisses. 

The offender made comments of a sexual nature, by referring to a sexual relationship with his wife and suggesting that he purchase the child 'a bunch of roses' and noting that he had 'flirted with an amazing girl' and 'could kiss [her] right now'. 

Later, he suggested that he 'call in' and give her 'a BIG cuddle hehe', saying he wished he could pick her up. He also referred to problems in his relationship with his wife, referring to her as 'that bitch' and asking if the child could offer a bed or if she had 'any ideas on a date for me'.

At times the messages were sent after 10:00pm and into the early hours of the morning. For example at 23h18 on 20 August 2011, he texted 'just so you know im not near her. Im sleepin on sofa in dineing room'.""


7Another source of information about the offending behaviour is also in exhibit A, that is what is called the statement of facts. That is an agreed account of the offending behaviour, the agreement being between the prosecution and the defence. It notes that the child - whose first name is Teaghan - was 12 years old at the time and the offender Mr Moss was 33. The context was that he was the coach of an under 14 girls' soccer team. The coach communicated with the team members' parents by means of text messages. He suggested that he exchange messages directly with Teaghan and that started to happen. Then the offensive texts occurred over the period, as I said, between 11 August and 29 August 2011. In all Mr Moss sent 206 text messages. Teaghan sent about 150. On at least 8 times text messages were sent after 10.00pm at night. She said that Mr Moss would usually but not always start the texting each day and was texting so often, she said, that ""I did not want to answer my phone. I did not even want to go near my phone.""

8The behaviour was limited to the exchange of texts and did not extend to face to face or personal inappropriate behaviour. Teaghan became progressively more uncomfortable with the text messages and on 29 August 2011 she approached the school counsellor and showed her the text messages. The counsellor immediately contacted the principal and Teaghan's mother. The Department of Community Services was also notified by the school.

9Teaghan's mother brought in the police who arrested Mr Moss on 20 September 2011. He was interviewed by the police. He acknowledged that he had done something wrong but confirmed that it had not extended beyond text messages and admitted that he had ""texted a couple of those inappropriate messages"". He acknowledged that he had ""stuffed up, I've made a mistake.""

10He said that he was mostly sending the texts to Teaghan when he was having issues with his home life. At the time that he was arrested Mr Moss said ""Yeah. I knew this was coming. I know I crossed the line.""

11He denied having feelings for the child or intending to pursue the friendship physically. 

12It is hardly surprising that that criminal behaviour by Mr Moss had an impact on the child Teaghan. A victim impact statement has been provided by her mother which is also part of exhibit A. Her mother pointed to what her daughter had to endure: the police interview and loss of her phone which was taken as evidence. She added that ""Teaghan is now very wary of men.""

13She had to have counselling but her mother was not sure how it was going. She said the people at soccer managed to find out and that her daughter ""lost a good friend from her team who no longer talks to her."" She said that her daughter became worried that Mr Moss ""would break into our house and steal her. She would not go to the shops for a long time without an adult for fear she might see him.""

14That victim impact statement illustrates why this kind of behaviour which Mr Moss engaged in is made into a crime. It illustrates the kind of impact which his persistent conduct had on the young girl who was receiving his attention. 

15I now turn to matters which are personal to Mr Moss. As I said there is a good deal of psychiatric and psychological material. Mr Moss was referred by his general practitioner to a psychiatrist Dr Esther Jesudason. In a report to Mr Moss' solicitor, which became exhibit 3, Dr Jesudason said that she had diagnosed Mr Moss with ""Bipolar Disorder."" She said that managing that condition would be treatment with medications and psychotherapy. She thought that his overall prognosis is good. 

16Dr Jesudason in a report to Mr Moss' general practitioner observed that Mr Moss was ""insightful and understood the nature of the charges. He was extremely remorseful. He reported that he had no intention or desire to sexually exploit the young girl and categorically denied any sexual intent or inappropriate behaviour."" She confirmed the diagnosis of bipolar disorder adding ""anxiety and moderate depression."" She observed that ""he may have had an untreated ADHD as a child."" Of some concern in Dr Jesudason's report to Mr Moss' general practitioner was an account that he had told her that ""the messages may have been considered boundary violations ie he may have overstood the mark as a coach but they were definitely not inappropriate or sexual.""

17Mr Moss also saw a clinical psychologist. The clinical psychologist said that Mr Moss ""is depressed and anxious and experiences severe anxiety attacks."" He referred to Dr Jesudason's diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The psychologist's name is Dr John Sjostedt and in a report to Mr Moss' solicitor which became exhibit 2 he said the following -

""Psychologically, Mr Moss, a quiet, reserved young man has a tendency towards impulsivity and impetuosity, as well as hyperactivity. He does not always think matters through thoroughly or completely before acting. If one combines the impulsivity of ADD/ADHD with the maniac phase of Bipolar Disorder then one can see how Mr Moss might act before thinking and send some 209 innocuous text messages over a period of months to a young thirteen to fourteen year old girl and not appreciate how that volume of text messages might look to others.""

He added that Mr Moss ""can see and understand how that might look to others now, but at the time he sent the messages his marriage was in a very fraught state and he was very unhappy and grief stricken."" I might add that I reject the reference to the text messages as being ""innocuous"" and the reference to the recipient being 13 to 14 years old is wrong. She was 12 at the time. Nevertheless Dr Sjostedt provides a significant description of Mr Moss' psychological condition at a relevant time. He believed that Mr Moss' ""prognosis is good.""

18Mr Moss was sent by his lawyers to the experienced forensic psychologist Anita Duffy who provided a report which became exhibit 3. Ms Duffy said that, from the description given to her by Mr Moss, ""it appears that he was suffering depression which further immobilised him, increased his levels of unhappiness and made him more passive in his relationships such that he felt helpless to an initiate a separation from his wife."" She said that ""[i]t appears that his correspondence with young Teaghan Teal occurred at a particularly vulnerable period in his life, and was an outlet where he could express himself to a person who had been experiencing similar problems"". She said that he ""acknowledges now that he was most inappropriate in the choice of person in whom he could confide his problems"". She added that he ""bitterly regrets his actions now."" She thought that Mr Moss ""requires considerable professional intervention to deal with his psychological problems on a number of fronts."" Ms Duffy recited some of the issues which were affecting Mr Moss in his life. He has been married twice. The first marriage lasted only a few years. He then formed a relationship with another woman whom he eventually married. That relationship was characterised by a good deal of violence. In fact Ms Duffy said that the ""relationship with his wife appears to be the reverse of the single 'battered woman' syndrome, in that he was frequently assaulted by his wife and although he wanted to leave her he felt unable to do so."" Issues occurred between them involving a pregnancy which resulted in either a stillbirth or a termination of the pregnancy and it was clear that Mr Moss had an adverse reaction to that event and it has affected him for some time.

19There is also a pre-sentence report from the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service. That report recorded that the author's enquiries ""indicated that at the time of the offence Mr Moss was emotionally unstable."" It referred to the unhappy relationship with his wife ""who drank excessively."" It noted that Mr Moss ""showed what appeared to be genuine remorse over his involvement in this offence."" The report said that he ""did appear to have some insight into the impact his offending behaviour had on the victim."" It noted that he ""is still grieving the loss of his unborn child and has yet to come to terms with the breakdown of his marriage."" It noted that he had seen a local psychologist on several occasions. An assessment from the same service placed Mr Moss in the moderate to low risk category relevant to other offenders.

20I will now refer to the points made by the prosecution and the defence in their arguments. Ms Wright refers to the importance of general deterrence in a case like this. That means that the sentence which a judge imposes for a crime like this must be such that other people who might be tempted to commit the same crime will be deterred from doing that because of the severity of the sentence. She says - 

""General deterrence is of particular significance in sentencing matters of this kind. Relevant to the need for a sentence serving the purposes of general deterrence is the difficulty in detecting such offending.""

21Mr G Porter of counsel who appeared for Mr Moss in the proceedings took exception to some of the authorities which were relied upon by Ms Wright in making her general submission about general deterrence. But as I understand it, in oral submissions he acknowledged the significance of general deterrence in a case like this, like any case, but he made a submission which I will return to about general deterrence being modified in this case because of his client's mental condition. I accept that general deterrence subject to that further submission is a significant factor.

22Ms Wright reminded me of the provisions of s 17A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which provides that ""a court shall not pass a sentence of imprisonment...unless the court, having considered all other available sentences, is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in the circumstances."" 

23I accept that submission and I accept the submission also made by her that the offence involved a breach of trust. As Ms Wright said, Mr Moss ""was in a position of trust and relative authority with respect to the child and this is an aggravating feature of the offence."" Obviously the parents of the children in the soccer team trusted a man such as Mr Moss to have their children in his care, but also - relevant to this case - trusted him in his communicating directly with the children who had direct access to him through the texting facility. He breached that trust significantly in this case. He was given the phone number which he could contact Teaghan on and abused that information which he was given.

24Ms Wright further argues that Mr Moss has shown a minimal degree of contrition. She points out that he did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings which is true. She points out that the evidence of contrition or remorse on his part appears in the psychological and psychiatric reports. She picked up the reference by the treating psychologist to the word ""innocuous"" in describing the behaviour. She submitted that the reports do not provide a sufficient basis for contrition to be taken into account. She referred also to the vehement denial by Mr Moss of any sexual motivation.

25Mr Porter on the other hand says that there is a good deal of evidence of contrition. He points to the references in the psychological, psychiatric and Probation Service reports about his client's attitude. I agree with Mr Porter in this regard. In particular the Probation and Parole officer who authored the report noted a degree of contrition and I infer that that person is experienced in making those observations. The psychiatrist in a report to the GP rather than to the solicitor noted Mr Moss' remorse about his behaviour. It does not carry the weight, as Ms Wright correctly observes, that it would carry if he had given evidence in the witness box but nevertheless it seems to me to be a good basis for me to conclude that Mr Moss is remorseful about what he has done.

26Ms Wright acknowledges that Mr Moss has pleaded guilty and that may be taken into account insofar as it has demonstrated a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. He is entitled to some discount in the sentence but she argues that 25 per cent which Mr Porter suggests is appropriate would be too high. 

27Ms Wright argues that the only appropriate sentence is a custodial sentence given the seriousness of the offence and the importance of general deterrence. She notes that Mr Moss has no previous offences but I accept her submission that it was that factor which enabled him to be placed in the position of trust which he abused. Exhibit B is the form which he signed correctly saying before he was appointed that he had no previous convictions. That has less weight than it might otherwise have because he abused that trust.

28Ms Wright argues that there is no causal relationship or at least that the causal relationship is weak between Mr Moss' behaviour and his psychiatric condition. Mr Porter on the other hand points to the reports of Dr Sjostedt and I am inclined to accept Mr Porter's argument. Dr Sjostedt said that by reference to the impulsivity associated with his past condition and the manic phase of his current condition ""one can see how Mr Moss might act before thinking"". That to my mind demonstrates some causal connection between his condition and his offending behaviour. 

29One also needs to take into account the circumstances of his marriage, his depression, all of which have been diagnosed by those qualified to make the diagnoses. Mr Porter referred me to what the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal and other Courts have said about the significance of a psychological or psychiatric condition or, to put it in more general terms, the mental health of an offender. He correctly highlighted or summarised the ways which it can affect a sentence in the following way. Where a person's mental health ""contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced."" I accept that submission and I accept because of Dr Sjostedt's remarks that there is a causal relationship. 

30He also pointed out that a person's mental health may have the ""consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed"". I accept that submission. It reduces somewhat the impact of the general deterrence which Ms Wright has referred to. A custodial sentence if a person has to go to jail ""may weigh more heavily on the person."" I accept that submission as well. The psychiatric and psychological condition of Mr Moss is a relevant factor in all of those ways. 

31As I said, Mr Porter suggested that the plea of guilty should result in a 25 per cent discount in his sentence. I do not accept that submission. I regard an appropriate discount as being one of 20 per cent. He first appeared charged in court on 20 October 2011. The police brief was served on him in January 2012 and his plea of guilty was about 5 months later on 22 June 2012. That does not attract what would be regarded as a top level discount but I would regard a 20 per cent discount as a fair assessment.

32I turn now, before coming to the sentence, to the question about whether Mr Moss should because of his conviction go on to a particular register. Ms Wright says that he should. Mr Porter says that he should not. The register is created under a New South Wales Act of Parliament called the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000. As Ms Wright points out in her written submissions, the Act describes a ""registrable person"". It defines a registrable person in s 3A(1) relevantly as ""a person whom a court has at any time...sentenced in respect of a registrable offence..."". A ""registrable offence"" is also defined. It can be a Class 1 or Class 2 offence. Ms Wright says that this offence is a Class 2 offence. She argues that it falls within one of the many definitions of a Class 2 offence. The definition which she says applies is this: it is ""an offence that involves an act of indecency against or in respect of a child, being an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for 12 months or more"". Obviously the second part of the definition applies. It is the first part that is controversial. 

33Ms Wright points out that the expression ""act of indecency"" is not defined in the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act but refers to two decisions of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal where the expression is used and referred to authoritatively. In R v Manson, R v Stamenkovic (Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 February 1993, unreported) Gleeson CJ, when he was Chief Justice of New South Wales and with whom Clarke JA and Sully J agreed, said that ""an indecent act is one which right-minded persons would consider to be contrary to community standards of decency."" His Honour had just referred to a New Zealand case called Purves v Inglis (1915) 34 NZLR 1051 at 1053. Gleeson CJ went on to say that in the New Zealand case the following was said:

""The word indecent has no definite legal meaning and it must be taken therefore in its modern and popular affectation. In the Standard Dictionary indecent is defined to be anything that is unbecoming or offensive to common propriety."" 

34Ms Wright referred to the fact that the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Eades v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (2010) 77 NSWLR 173, [2010] NSWCA 241 adopted through Campbell JA - with whom Beazley JA as her Honour then was agreed - the description by Gleeson CJ of an ""indecent act"". Ms Wright went on to refer to s 473.4 of the Criminal Code which refers to the ""matters to be taken into account in deciding for the purposes of this Part whether reasonable persons would regard particular material, or a particular use of a carriage service, as being, in all the circumstances, offensive"". And those matters include the ""standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults"". She refers to the authorities which permit me to take into account the context of the Act including the surrounding circumstances. 

35She says that the offence in the present case does, in the terms of the definition of a Class 2 offence, involve ""an act of indecency against or in respect of a child"". She says that a number of the messages involve a sexual nature. She also argues that the expression ""in respect of"" used in the definition of the offence ""make it clear that the act of indecency in question need not involve physical contact with the child."" I accept that submission. She points out that a person's purpose in communicating with the child is relevant although not decisive. I accept that. The authorities say as much. She points out that Mr Moss in this case ""stated that he would have pursued a relationship with the child if she were his age"". She went on to argue that the ""content and number of the text messages sent to the child, and the time at which many of them were sent, are such as to meet the description of 'an act of indecency against or in respect of a child', being an act involving a child which right-minded persons would consider to be contrary to community standards of decency.""

36Mr Porter, on the other hand, referred to another offence in a related section of the Criminal Code, namely s 474.27A which refers to indecent material being transmitted and defines ""indecent"" as meaning ""indecent according to the standards of ordinary people"". He says that the argument advanced by Ms Wright would capture behaviour far too broadly. He says that the definition of the offence that his client has been convicted of refers to ""menacing, harassing or offensive"" and there is no element of indecency. His argument is that looking at the definition of a Class 2 offence, it really requires indecency to be part of the offence or an element of the offence rather than a reference to behaviour. 

37In my opinion this offence does involve an act of indecency in respect of a child. It is clear that the behaviour that Mr Moss engaged in would be regarded as ""contrary to community standards of decency"" and certainly - applying the quotation extracted by Gleeson CJ from Purvis v Inglis - ""anything that is unbecoming or offensive to common propriety"". In addition I accept the submission of Ms Wright when she refers to s 473.4 which directs me to take into account standards of ""morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults"". 

38The content of a number of the exchanges, including the references to an interest in being in a relationship with the child were it not for her age and references to other matters, clearly leave me with no doubt that the behaviour involved an act of indecency. 

39Finally I do not regard it as necessary that the act of indecency be an actual defined element of the offence. I think the act of indecency - referred to in the relevant definition of a Class 2 offence - is a reference to behaviour rather than a defined element. I note in this regard that the legislature in at least two other definitions specifies when certain conduct is to be an element of an offence. In the definition of a Class 1 offence contained in cl (g), it includes an ""offence an element of which is an intention to commit"" a particular kind of offence. 

40In another definition of a Class 2 offence in cl (l) it refers to an offence ""an element of which is an intention to commit an offence of a kind listed in this definition"". The legislature, it seems to me, has made a distinction between behaviour and an element of an offence. So I have decided that Mr Moss is a registrable person because he has been convicted of a Class 2 offence. 

41I turn now to the question of the kind of sentence that I will impose. I agree with Ms Wright that because of the seriousness of the offence and the need for some general deterrence, it should be a sentence of imprisonment. I do not accept Mr Porter's submission that a good behaviour bond would be sufficient. This is because the behaviour extended over a period of nearly three weeks. It has obviously had a significant impact on the child, Teaghan. However, because of the impact of the psychological and psychiatric evidence in the ways that I have mentioned, I regard it as appropriate for the sentence to be suspended and in due course I will suspend the prison sentence which I am about to impose. 

42Although general deterrence is important, it is reduced somewhat because of the psychiatric evidence and psychological evidence in this case. I agree with Mr Porter that his client's prospects of rehabilitation are good and that he has already commenced to undertake that course. I have had regard to the comparable sentences helpfully provided by Ms Wright. Full-time custody in those sentences was imposed when, it seems to me, the behaviour was more serious or there was more than one offence. I am sentencing Mr Moss for just one offence. 

43Given the seriousness of the offence I would regard an appropriate penalty as being one of 15 months imprisonment. I will discount that by 20 per cent because Mr Moss has facilitated the course of justice by pleading guilty. I therefore determine that an appropriate sentence is one of 12 months imprisonment. 

44Now just before I impose that sentence and I'll just get counsel's help with the section. I note, returning to the registrable offence question, that one of the definitions of a Class 2 offence is under cl (k) ""an offence under a law of a foreign jurisdiction that the regulations state as a Class 2 offence"". Regulation 18 of the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Regulation 2009 lists a number of offences against certain sections of the Criminal Code. Those offences include some of the offences in s 474 but do not include this offence which is under s 474.17 but to my mind that is not surprising because s 474.17 does not include, in terms, a reference to a child. The purposes of the definition of a Class 2 offence in cl (a) is widely defined to pick up the kind of behaviour, in my opinion, which happened to fall within s 474.17 in this case. Now you've referred to in your submissions - 20(1) is that right? A suspended sentence.

WRIGHT: Subsection 1B your Honour, yes.
HIS HONOUR: Yes good. Would you stand up Mr Moss. 

45I sentence you to imprisonment for 12 months in respect of the offence that I have convicted you of and I direct by order that you be released upon giving security in respect of that offence as soon as you have given that security. Just have a seat Mr Moss. 

HIS HONOUR: Ms Wright, upon giving security of the kind referred to in s 20(1)(a) either forthwith or after he has served a specified - it is going to be forthwith, so I should add that. Do you require any security or not?
WRIGHT: Your Honour is required to set an amount. I understand it's not actually payable. It's generally $500 or $1000, to the order of about $500.
HIS HONOUR: $500, okay. Mr Porter, any - no?
PORTER: Thank you, your Honour.

46I direct by order that you be released upon giving security in the amount of $500 forthwith.

HIS HONOUR: Any other orders?
WRIGHT: To be of good behaviour.
HIS HONOUR: Do you have the Act? I normally bring it with me but for some reason I haven't. I had better look at the section. That's what I preach about to readers so I had better do it myself. Where does the good behaviour come in?
WRIGHT: If I could be of assistance, generally the way it's expressed is sentence the person to imprisonment in respect of the offence for a period of 12 months, but direct by order that the person be released forthwith, self security in the sum of $500, on condition that he be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months. Your Honour will see s 19AC(1) requires the Court to make a recognisance release order in respect of a sentence of imprisonment that does not exceed 3 years, unless certain exceptions apply. Those exceptions do not apply in this case. So the recognisance release order, which is another way of saying good behaviour bond in the federal context, is worked into the suspended sentence order.
HIS HONOUR: Thank you.

47I sentence Mr Moss to 12 months imprisonment. I direct by order that he be released forthwith upon giving self security by recognisance in the sum of $500 that he will comply with the condition that he will be of good behaviour for the period of 12 months. You are not asking for any reparation, restitution or compensation?

WRIGHT: No, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Or pecuniary penalty or any other conditions?
WRIGHT: No, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: I think I have now made the order, haven't I?
WRIGHT: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: I've got to explain that to Mr Moss and under that other Act, the Registration Act, we found that the Court has to - I think that s 4, he has to receive a notice from the Court, which I guess he gets downstairs. 
WRIGHT: I'm not able to assist actually, your Honour.
PORTER: As I think I indicated last week in the State matters, they have the documents ready for the court.
HIS HONOUR: I think that's right, the court has to do it. I don't think I start giving him a notice.
PORTER: No, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: I am going to add something else to my reasons. 

48I also took into account in fixing the sentence that Mr Moss would be subject to the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000. Ms Wright referred me to the judgment of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in TMTW v R [2008] NSWCCA 50, and the judgment of Simpson J in that case, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and James J agreed, and I regard this as the kind of case which to a limited extent does involve some extra curial punishment. As her Honour said at [53], Mr Moss will be ""for eight years...to be branded a sexual offender, to be known, at least to local police, in that capacity, and will be reminded of his crime, something he would, no doubt, prefer to put out of his mind. I do not regard this as entirely irrelevant."" For the same reasons, I have given some weight to that factor. I return the Criminal Code.

WRIGHT: Just one small matter, if I could respectfully ask, in your Honour's reasons where the word [name of child] appears, I am instructed there was a suppression order made--
HIS HONOUR: Is it a suppression order or is it protected by some legislation in the State?
WRIGHT: Yes, there is legislation--
HIS HONOUR: Yes, and presumably it prevents the publication of the name of a victim?
WRIGHT: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: Is it Commonwealth legislation?
WRIGHT: It's State legislation.
HIS HONOUR: So the State legislation applies, picks up. What I normally do, and thank you for reminding me, I announce to the court when I have referred to the victim of - usually a sexual offence - that that name is referred to in court but is not to be repeated outside the court and indeed it is an offence to do so. I don't make an order; I just state the effect of the law. Does that sound right?
WRIGHT: Yes, your Honour. Might the letter S be used in the transcript?
HIS HONOUR: The transcript of the sentence I will order, and my associate and I will anonymise it. I sometimes use a pseudonym but I indicate to all those in court - I have referred to the victim of these offences. I have just referred to her as [name of child], and her full name is [name of child]. It is appropriate for that name to be uttered by me in court, and referred to in court, but it is against the law to mention that name to anybody outside the court who does not know about these proceedings, or to publish the name any further in connection with these proceedings. It is an offence.
WRIGHT: Thank you, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Anything else I need to do - no?
PORTER: No, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Mr Moss, I have convicted you of the offence. You have pleaded guilty. I have given you a gaol sentence. It is a 12 month gaol sentence, but I have suspended the sentence. I have suspended it on condition that you sign a document downstairs saying that you will behave yourself for the 12 months, you will stay out of trouble. You have got to promise to pay $500 if you do not stay out of trouble, and if you breach that and you get into trouble in some way - it does not have to be the same sort of behaviour; It could be a drink driving charge, or an assault charge - I do not think you will find yourself in trouble from what I have read about you, but you will have to come back before court and the suspended sentence may no longer be suspended, and you could end up in gaol. Do you understand that?
OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: One other thing, Mr Moss. For the reasons that I have given you will go onto that register for the protection of children. Mr Porter will explain that more to you but there will be documents that you will be given downstairs in the registry as well. Do you understand that as well?
OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.

2761443,R v Naden [2013] NSWSC 541,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: When the offender was before me on 2 May 2013, I expressed a concern as to the offender's plea of guilty to count 1. My concern arose from reading the reports of Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg. The reports of the psychiatrists disclose statements made to them which indicated that his plea to the sexual assault may have arisen out of convenience and was not attributable to a consciousness of guilt. 

2The offender pleaded guilty to the charge on arraignment on 22 March 2013. He adhered to that plea on 24 April 2013, and he re-affirmed that plea today. 

3It has been expressly stated today by Mr Ierace SC on behalf of the offender that by that plea he intends to admit his guilt of the offence being count 1. 

4Both psychiatrists are of the opinion the offender is fit to be tried and there is no suggestion he was not apprised of all of the facts when he entered and adhered to the plea. He is represented by very experienced counsel. 

5Mr Ierace submits, on the offender's behalf, in all of the circumstances the court ought not to reject the plea of guilty to count 1. Mr Crown supports that application.

6In Meissner v Queen [1995] HCA 41; (1995) 184 CLR 132, Brennan, Toohey and McHugh JJ said at p 141:

""...A person charged with an offence is at liberty to plead guilty or not guilty to the charge, whether or not that person is in truth guilty or not guilty... A court will act on a plea of guilty when it is entered in open court by a person who is of full age and apparently of sound mind and understanding, provided the plea is entered in exercise of a free choice in the interests of the person entering the plea. There is no miscarriage of justice if a court does act on such a plea, even if the person entering it is not in truth guilty of the offence...""

7Dawson J stated at p 157:

""...It is true that a person may plead guilty on grounds which extend beyond that person's belief in his guilt. He may do so for all manner of reasons: for example, to avoid worry, inconvenience or expense; to avoid publicity; to protect his family or friends; or in the hope of obtaining a more lenient sentence than he would if convicted after a plea of not guilty. The entry of a plea of guilty upon grounds such as these nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. Ordinarily that will only be where the accused did not understand the nature of the charge or did not intend to admit he was guilty of it or if upon the facts admitted by the plea he could not in law have been guilty of the offence. But the accused may show that a miscarriage of justice occurred in other ways and so be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty and have his conviction set aside. For example, he may show his plea was induced by intimidation of one kind or another, or by an improper inducement or by fraud.""

8It appears from the judgment of the High Court in Meissner that the acceptance of a plea of guilty entered in open court by a person of full age and apparently of sound mind and understanding, and made in the exercise of free choice in the interests of that person causes no miscarriage of justice. A miscarriage of justice will normally only arise where the offender did not understand the charge or did not intend by his plea to admit his guilt of it or upon the facts admitted by the plea he could not in law have been guilty of the offence. 

9In Wong v DPP [2005] NSWSC 129; (2005) 155 A Crim R 37, Howie J observed at [33]:

""A court is entitled to accept a plea of guilty that is given in the exercise of a free choice in a defendant's own interests and there will be no miscarriage resulting from reliance on the plea even though the person entering the plea 'is not in truth guilty of the offence'...""

10The Crown case against the offender is strong, consisting of a very prompt complaint by a 12 year-old girl with no apparent defects in reliability, no motive to lie and in a context where he was liked and trusted by the complainant and her family up until the incident. 

11Accordingly, I do not propose to reject the plea.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL: For the reasons set out by Adams J and Beech-Jones J, I agree that to the extent necessary, leave should be granted to the applicant to rely upon Grounds of Appeal 2(a), 2(b), 2(c) and 2(d). For the reasons set out by their Honours, I accept that those Grounds of Appeal have been made out essentially on the basis set out in Douglass v R [2012] HCA 34; 290 ALR 699 in that the learned trial judge did not assess the “reliability” of the complainant’s evidence as distinct from her honesty as a witness. Clearly such an assessment was required. It follows that these Grounds of Appeal having been made out, the conviction of the applicant should be quashed.
	
	
	I also agree with their Honours that Ground of Appeal 1 should be dismissed.
	
	
	I prefer to express no opinion on the question of whether the verdict arrived at by the trial judge was “unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence” (Criminal Appeal Act 1912 – s 6(1)). It is not necessary to reach a decision on that issue given the conclusion which I have reached as to the orders which ought to be made.
	
	
	As their Honours have pointed out, the applicant has now served the entirety of his non-parole period and a substantial part of the balance of term. In those circumstances, the interests of justice do not require that there be a new trial (Jiminez v The Queen [1992] HCA 14; 173 CLR 572 at 590 per McHugh J; Haoui v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 209 at [164] – [166] per Johnson J).

Introduction


	
	Following a trial by judge alone, the appellant Hilton John Cawthray was convicted on one count of aggravated indecent assault and one count of common assault, both offences allegedly committed on his granddaughter between 1 May 2005 and 30 September 2006. The prosecution’s case was that the appellant called the complainant, who was then aged six or seven years, onto a bed in which he was then lying, put his hand down her pants and touched her on the outside of her vagina. When she tried to resist him by kicking him, he squeezed her one wrist.
	
	
	For the common assault the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of six months commencing on 13 October 2010. In respect of the indecent assault, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of two years imprisonment commencing on 13 January 2011 with a balance of term of 1 year. He seeks leave to appeal against his convictions. There is no appeal against the sentences imposed.
	


The grounds of appeal

Ground 1

The Trial Judge was in error in his procedural approach in two ways:


	
	The trial judge erred in his procedural approach in making a positive finding that the complainant was a believable witness before then applying the Murray direction and scrutinising her evidence thereby casting an onus on that process to shift that positive finding; and
	
	
	The trial judge engaged in impermissible reasoning by appearing to reverse the onus of proof on two issues to arrive at his finding of guilt.
	


Ground 2

The findings of guilt by the trial Judge should be set aside upon the ground that they are unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. The findings of guilt are unreasonable having regard to the following matters:


	
	The trial judge erred when he found time was not of the essence in relation to the dates in the indictment.
	
	
	The trial judge erred by failing to properly warn himself in accordance with the direction sought under section 165A of the Evidence Act NSW 1995 that the evidence of the complainant might be unreliable.
	
	
	The trial judge erred in his approach to giving himself the Crofts direction that the delay in complaint should be taken into account in the assessment of the credibility of the complainant in that the question posed by the trial judge referred to the truthfulness of the allegation and not the credibility or reliability of the complainant.
	
	
	The trial judge failed to properly comply with the Murray direction in two respects:
	



	
	the terms of the warning were insufficient in that the trial judge did not direct himself that he had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was a truthful, reliable and accurate witness; and
	
	
	the trial judge approached the matter in terms of belief or disbelief of the complainant and did not give the complainant’s evidence the sufficiently careful scrutiny which the warning, carried into effect would have required.
	



	
	Ground 1 is awkwardly phrased. There is no question of any procedural error. In substance, as I understand it, ground 1(a) is a complaint that the learned trial judge made findings as to the credibility of the complainant before applying the relevant tests, thereby in effect, reversing the onus of proof. Ground 1(b) refers to the judge “appearing to reverse the onus of proof”. (Emphasis added). This is scarcely an error of law. The question is not one of appearance but of substance although, of course, the appearance might suggest the substance. An error as to the onus of proof is clearly a significant error of law.
	
	
	The complaints in ground 2 do not require any further explication. The reference to Crofts is Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427, in which the majority restated (at 448) the requirement –
	


“[In] appropriate cases juries… [should be] told that the absence of timely complaint (if that be their conclusion) was relevant to the credibility of the complainant and a fact to be considered in evaluating the consistency of the complainant’s evidence. There might be ‘many reasons’ to explain why the complaint was not made promptly. It was for the jury to weigh up those possible reasons. But it was also for the jury to weigh up the significance of the delay in complaining”.

This restatement was necessary to correct the mistaken notion that legislative changes, such as that brought about by s 405B of the Crimes Act 1900 required the judge to instruct the jury to disregard delays in complaint.


	
	The reference in the grounds of appeal to Murray is, I take it, a reference to R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 where Lee J said (at 19) –
	


“… In all cases of serious crime it is customary for judges to stress that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of the crime, the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care before a conclusion is arrived at that a verdict of guilty should be brought in; but a direction of that kind does not of itself imply that the witness’ evidence is unreliable.”

The evidence


	
	Although given late in the trial, it is useful to mention at the outset the evidence of an officer of the Probation and Parole Service about the appellant’s movements. Amongst other things, she said that the appellant had started a parole order in Queensland on 23 December 2003 after having served a sentence of approximately 18 years for murder. The arrangement was for him to live with his daughter, the complainant’s mother, in Wagga Wagga and he began to reside at that address from 22 July 2004. He continued to live there until 16 June 2006, when he moved to other premises in Wagga Wagga. His parole was subsequently revoked and, in August 2010 he was in gaol, about to be released on parole.
	
	
	The evidence commenced on 5 September 2011 with the tender by the Crown of the complainant’s videoed interview with police, which had taken place on 2 September 2010. The complainant also gave evidence at the trial by video. Before she gave her evidence, the DVD of the interview was played to her.
	
	
	Dealing first with the circumstances of the alleged offence, the complainant was asked to tell the officer what happened “from the very beginning to the very end”. The sequence of events described by the complainant was that the appellant had pulled her onto his bed and then started touching her, that she was kicking him and every time she did so, he squeezed her wrist. She told him to stop but he would not. He told her, “Don’t tell mummy”. She said, “That’s um, all”.
	
	
	The police officer then asked some questions to get more detail. (There is no suggestion that these questions were in any way inappropriate.) The complainant added that the appellant had said, “Come here” and that he put her under the blankets. She asked, “What are you doing?” He did not say anything in response. She said that he put his right “hand down my panties” and touched her “on my vagina” on the outside with his hand. She was asked, “And so when he put his hands down your undies, well what part, what part of your undies did he put his hand down?” and answered, “The front part”. The officer asked, “How did it stop?” and the complainant replied, “I don’t know, he just stopped, and I kicked him really hard”. She said that she kicked him on his legs and feet and kept telling him to stop but he didn’t. The officer asked, “What could your body feel when he … [touched you on the outside]?” She said, “I don’t know, I was just telling him to stop”. She said that when she kicked he would squeeze her wrist and every time she kicked harder he would squeeze harder. The officer asked, “Do you remember which arm, which wrist it was that he squeezed? The complainant replied, “”I think he squeezed both of them … but mainly this one – the left”. When he finished, he said “Don’t tell mummy, don’t tell anyone else either” and then he said, “run along”. She ran to her room. After questions about whether he said anything about the incident at a later time (no) and her wanting to tell her mother but not doing so (I deal with this issue later), the complainant was asked, “And after this time that Pop touched you on the vagina and squeezed you on the wrist, how did you feel about Poppy then? She replied, “I got angry… And I didn’t really want to see him again”.
	
	
	The complainant thought she was seven or eight years of age at the time (which would date the offence to 2006 or 2007). She said it occurred in the family home in Wagga Wagga in the appellant’s bedroom, where there was a bedside table “with his stuff on it”. This evidence was, in substance, repeated in her evidence. At the interview, the complainant had drawn a sketch plan of the layout of the house, depicting amongst other rooms, “his room”. This plan was exhibited in the trial by the Crown. She said, as to the time of day, “Well, he knew that mum sleeps in so he did it early in the morning … and she wouldn’t, she wouldn’t know … It was probably about 8 in the morning”. She said that her mother was in bed at the time and her sister was either in bed or at her friend’s house. The appellant was wearing a navy tank top and blue jeans.
	
	
	The complainant said that the appellant was still living with the family after the offence “probably about a year or two… ‘cause mum didn’t know. She thought it was all ok”. In cross-examination the complainant gave some further evidence about work that the appellant did around the house but did not remember whether she brought tools to him or helped him with painting. She remembered the replacement of the kitchen and was “pretty sure he did it by himself”. She told the police and repeated in her evidence, on each occasion without any qualification or expression of uncertainty, that the offence occurred after the kitchen had been completed. She did not remember whether it was weeks or months after.
	
	
	The complainant said that she thought that she was in year one or two, about six or seven years of age, when the appellant came to live with the family in Wagga Wagga. At that time she was told by her mother that he had come from Tasmania. She agreed that when he moved in she got on very well with him, used to cuddle him, would sit on his knee, play with him and follow him around when he was doing work about the house. From time to time she would go into his room to say goodnight to him. She recalled that when he lived at the house he would get up very early in the morning, much earlier than her mother and would already be up when the complainant and her sister would wake up.
	
	
	The complainant had been told various things about the appellant of a negative character. Her account of when she was told these things and what exactly she was told is not altogether clear. During the interview the complainant was asked whether there was a time when she thought she wanted to tell her mother. The complainant’s answer was –
	


“Well, mum thought this was brave but um, I didn't want to tell mum or my sister or anyone, because l heard from my cousins that he had done something really disgusting, like, something really bad to another person, so I didn't want my mum or my sister or me to get hurt, so I didn't say anything.

Q180. Ok. Alright. What did you hear from your cousin?

A. Oh. She didn’t say, but um, she told my sister. But I know now what it was.”


	
	In the interview with the police the complainant said that her mother asked us (meaning her and her older sister) before (that is, before she made her complaint) if he did (meaning touched them sexually) “but we kept on saying no”. She said that her mother had asked her about this both whilst they were living at Wagga Wagga and when they moved. The complainant said that she told a cousin when she was in year three that “My Pop touched me” and her friend’s response was “Really?” to which she replied “Yes” but nothing more was said. The cousin was not called to give evidence, (her absence being explained). The complainant said, in effect, that the first close member of the family that she told was her grandmother about a week before the police interview. Her mother was in hospital. The complainant said to police –
	


“And I told my Nan, because um, when my mum was in the hospital, my Nan told me about all the stuff he has been doing lately and then I said um, she said, do you know that um, did you know? And I said no. And then she said um, “Do you know that he’s all grotty?” and I said “Yes.” And she said, “How?” And then I said, ""Because he's touched me too.”

The complainant was asked –

“Q218. Would you know why your Nan would say those things to you the other week about your Pop? Do you know why she talked to you about that?

A. Um, because he did something new. Like, he did something again.

Q219. Oh, Ok.

A. And um, I think my Nan knew that my mum didn't want to tell me so um, I think my mum got my Nan to tell me.

Q220. What did she tell you?

A. She just um, said that, because used to have um, and old friend in Wagga, and um, she was called Julie Anne Crocker, and she has a daughter too, and Julie Anne was in the shower and he was watching her in the shower.”


	
	This matter was explored in cross-examination at the trial. The complainant was reminded of what she had said in her interview with the police about hearing that the appellant “did something really bad to another person”. She said that she heard this from her cousins, that she could not remember exactly what she was told but that it was “something to do with a gun or something and with his old wife or something… like cheating or something, I can’t remember”. She said that she understood that it was really bad. She said that she found it out before the assault, whilst he was still living with the family. She said that her mother had not told her anything like that. She said that when she found out about it, it made her a bit scared of the appellant and agreed that it changed the way she thought about him. She said that she thought the appellant was a bad man. She said that she understood that the appellant had hurt his wife with the gun “because why would there be a gun involved”. Her cousins had not told her that the appellant had been in gaol but she guessed that it was so. She did not talk to her mother about it at the time. The first time that she spoke to her mother about the appellant having been in gaol was when her mother was in hospital when she told her of the touching incident. In her evidence, the conversation with her grandmother which precipitated the making of the complaint was given as follows –
	


“Q. What was it that your Nan said to you about your Poppy that day, do you remember?

A. She said “There's been - If your Mum hasn't told you there's been an incident with, with Poppy” and I said “Yeah how?” and then she said “Oh well apparently he's been looking at Julianne your old friend in Wagga in a shower through the window” and she said “Did you ever think that he’d do something like that?” and I said “Yeah”. And then she said “How?” and then I said – I told her the story.”


	
	Her grandmother had also told her, about the time of the incident, that she should not get into the car with the appellant, from which the complainant gathered, “…she’s worried about me and that she was scared and that she doesn’t want me to get hurt”. Her grandmother also told the complainant (although it is not clear when this conversation occurred) that “she would try and make sure that [the appellant] wouldn’t be allowed to come and live with you”. The complainant said that made her feel scared. She agreed that, from what she had been told by her grandmother, she understood that her grandmother did not like the appellant and that her grandmother had always conveyed that feeling, having said lots of things about him over the years that were not very nice.
	
	
	In respect of the misconduct, the complainant said that she knew that the appellant had done something wrong but that she did not tell her mother because, “I thought that if I told my mum and like everybody else that I would be in trouble by him and that I would get other people hurt because I heard what my cousins told me so I just kept it quiet and I didn’t want to say anything”. She said that she remembered when her mother asked her if the appellant had ever touched her. She said that this occurred after the incident when they were still living in Wagga Wagga and that she said “No”, “Because I didn’t want her to know”. She did not recall whether she had been asked again whilst they were living in Wagga Wagga and, although she told the police there was a second occasion when they moved to another house that she was asked and had denied any touching, she did not recall this in her evidence. She said in her evidence that she also told her sister that it had not happened “Because, like she was asking me too”. The complainant was asked –
	


“Q. So did your Mum ask you again when you were living in your new house whether Poppy had touched you?

A. I don't remember. I don't know I think when I said - we kept saying no is because she kept on asking us like at the same time she said “Oh has he touched you?” and we said “No” and she said “Has he touched you?” and I - and we kept saying “No” so.

Q. So she asked you a number of times?

A. Yeah but at the same time but yeah.

Q. And you said that ""We kept saying no""--

A. Yeah.

Q. Is the we?

A. Me and …[my sister].

Q. So do you remember now that you and …[your sister] were together when your Mum was asking you--

A. Mm.

Q. --whether your Pop had touched you?

A. Yeah.

Q. And you both said ""No""?

A. Yeah.

Q. In front of each other?

A. Yeah.

Q. And your Mum then asked you again “Has he been touching you?” and you both said no again?

A. Mm.”

Not surprisingly, counsel asked as follows –

“Q. So why did you tell your Nan on 10 August what had changed?

A. Well l felt more comfortable when Nan said that he's been looking at other people in the shower I don't know why but yeah I just did.”


	
	The complainant was cross-examined, in telling her mother about the misconduct (see below), that the appellant told her, “Come lie down with me”, which she had not mentioned to the police. She said, in effect, that what she told her mother was correct. The complainant had also told her mother that the appellant had pulled her pants down. It was pointed out to her that she had told the police that Poppy had put his hand down the front of her pants. She said, “Yeah, he, he pulled my pants and then put his hand down there”.
	
	
	The complainant’s grandmother and mother also gave evidence. The grandmother is the appellant’s ex-wife. Their relationship ended unhappily in 1979. The dislike for him continued but she “thought, as he had been to prison for 19 years, he was rehabilitated and I was willing to give him another chance so I was friendly and spoke to him.” After the appellant had served 19 years for his sentence he planned to come back to live with their daughter, the complainant’s mother and his grandchildren. She said that she did not think that it was a good idea and tried to talk her daughter out of it. Indeed, although she said “she wasn’t bitter against him”, she was “appalled at the prospect of [him] living with the family”. The grandmother said that on 18 August 2010 she called in after school to mind the complainant and her sister because their mother was in hospital, and they were out on the back veranda having a drink when she had a conversation with the complainant. Her account of that conversation was elicited as follows –
	


“Q. Did you have a conversation at that time with … [the complainant]?

A. I did.

Q. Are you able to recount that conversation in the first person?

A. Yes.

Q. Between yourself and … [the complainant]? Would you do that please?

A. Yes. I said to … [the complainant] - I forget the first sentence but I said to her, “Are you aware that Poppy might be coming to live in this area,” and she said “No.” And I said, “Oh well he might be, darling,” and she said, “I don't want him to come up here.”

Q. All right. Now do you mind just going back a little bit?

A. Yes.

Q. Before … [the complainant] said that she didn't want him to come back here, did you mention in the conversation at any time where the accused had been?

A. Yes I said to her “Are you aware he's been in gaol”.

Q. Did you know when that came up, when you raised that with …[the complainant]? Was it the beginning of the conversation?

A. Yes at the beginning of the conversation.

Q. What did she say to that?

A. She said “Yes”

Q. Did you say anything in response to that?

A. I said to her, “Do you know what for, darling?” And she didn't answer and I didn't tell her. I didn't want to alarm her.

Q. Did you then go on to say something else to her?

A. Yes.

Q. Could you tell his Honour what you said?

A. I said to her, “Well why don't you want him to come up here?” And she said “I don't want him up here because he's a bad man.” And I said. “Is that because he’s been in gaol.” and she said “Yes.” and then she said something like “I still don't want him up here, he’s a bad man.” And I said, “Why? Why do you say that?” And she said, “He touched me.” And I didn't want to admit what my gut feeling was so I said to her “Oh did he touch your arm, … [the complainant]” And she said, “No, he touched me down there,” and she looked highly embarrassed and red faced and put her hand, her whole hand down by her genital area.

Q. During that conversation was there any mention by you of a car, or getting into a car?

A. Yes I did say to her before all that, I said, “If he comes up here you'd better be a little bit careful, …[the complainant]. Don’t get into a car or anything like that.”

Q. When was that in the conversation, are you able to say?

A. Yes that was at the beginning of the conversation because I knew he was in prison and what for.

Q. When you said that, what was the response if any to you saying that to …[the complainant]?

A. She said, “I don't want him up here, he's a bad man.” after that yeah.

Q. I think we'd got to the part where …[the complainant] had indicated her genital area when she said she'd been touched?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you do something then to her?

A. I put my arm around her and I told her she was a very brave little girl for telling Nanny and I said “ will tell Mummy and we’ll try not to have him come up here.”

Q. And did she say anything in response to that?

A. Well out of the blue she just said, “He tried to pull me onto the bed,” or ""He pulled me onto the bed and I kicked and kicked but he was too strong but he was too strong.” And I didn't want to upset her or anything so I didn't ask what happened or anything. I just said, “Oh dear.” or something like that.

Q. Did …[the complainant] say anything else to you at that time about what she had just told you?

A. No. I just kept putting my arm around her and telling her how brave she was and the fact that I'd tell Mummy and Mummy would do something to sort it out.

Q. And then I think you at some point went to the Cessnock Police Station. That was in fact the next day?

A. I did.”


	
	In the grandmother’s statement to the police, however, the only information she reported was that the complainant told her, “He touched me”, that she asked “On the arm?” and was told “Nanny down there”. The statement does not mention the appellant pulling the complainant onto the bed and she kicking him. However, the grandmother said, in cross-examination, that this information was contained in what she described as the original statement that was given to the investigating police officer. That officer’s statement refers to the complainant saying to the grandmother, “I was kicking him and telling him to stop but he wouldn’t” but there was no reference to pulling the complainant onto the bed.
	
	
	I should mention that the grandmother gave inconsistent evidence as to what she knew about the appellant’s criminal record which, to my mind, reflected adversely on her reliability and perhaps even honesty as a witness. However, those matters do not seem to me to be material to the central part of her evidence, which concerned the conversation with the complainant in which she disclosed the appellant’s alleged conduct.
	
	
	The complainant’s mother confirmed the dates of birth of her two daughters, the elder being three years older than the complainant. She had separated from her partner in 2001 and since that date had sole custody of the girls. She said that in July or August 2004 her father, the appellant, came to live with her and her daughters in Wagga Wagga as part of the conditions of his parole following his release from prison in Queensland. He lived with the family from 2004 until September 2006 when he moved out to another suburb in Wagga Wagga. At the time the appellant moved in the girls were five and eight years of age.
	
	
	The mother said that during the first six months after the appellant arrived he did some work on the house, fixing the roof, paving around the pool and painting. Indeed, during the two year period he did many handyman type jobs. The appellant usually rose at about 5.30am or 6.00am and was not prone to lying around in bed until 8.00am, whilst the mother stayed in bed until 7.30am when her alarm went off. By that time he was always up. It was after he had moved out that he helped kitchen renovators with putting in a new kitchen. The mother was unable to say how long after the appellant left the house that the kitchen renovations were undertaken but, as I understand her evidence, rather thought it was some months. She confirmed in cross-examination that while the girls were living in Wagga Wagga there was an occasion when she asked them whether their grandfather had touched them inappropriately and that the complainant’s answer was no, the mother being satisfied with this response. When they moved to Cessnock she had again asked the complainant about whether her grandfather had touched her inappropriately, although she could not recall the circumstances in which she came to do so. She remembered, however, that the complainant said no. She agreed that she had probably asked it more than once.
	
	
	After he moved out he would visit every day, have a cup of tea and stay for the evening meal most nights. Usually, he would leave at about 9.00pm. When the appellant visited the house after he left, the complainant would spend time with him although the oldest daughter would not. Both would usually go to his room and say goodnight and maybe lie down in his bed. In October 2007 the mother and the girls moved to the Cessnock area but the appellant did not. He visited once or twice a year.
	
	
	When her father was living with the family in Wagga Wagga he had a very close relationship with both girls at the beginning. In her eyes, the relationship between the complainant and her grandfather was “a perfectly normal loving relationship” and the mother agreed that that remained the case for the entire time that they lived in Wagga Wagga. In about 2005 the older daughter changed her attitude towards her grandfather, describing him as a “mean man” but no such change occurred so far as the complainant was concerned and she agreed that “things just seemed to go along perfectly smoothly for the entire time… that your father lived in the house with you”.
	
	
	On 16 August 2010 the mother went into hospital and, whilst there, received a telephone call from her mother, the children’s grandmother. She said something to the effect, “I’ve got some bad news for you, are you sitting down?” The mother responded, “Well I am laying down” and then the grandmother said, “… [The complainant’s] come clean to me about your father touching her”. Following that conversation, the mother spoke to the complainant in the hospital two days later. Her evidence as to this conversation was –
	


“Q And what did …[the complainant] say?

A. I said to her, “Nanny's told me what happened. What happened, what did Poppy do to you,"" and she said ""He touched me down there."" And she pointed to her vagina and I said, ""What do you mean,"" and she said, ""He touched me on the vagina."" And I said ""What did he actually do,"" and she said, “He’ll pull my pyjama pants down and he was playing with my vagina,"" and I said, “What did you do?"" And she said, ""I tried to fight him. I kicked him, I tried to kick him off but he held me,"" and she said she just kept kicking him until she could get him - get away from him.

Q. You asked her something else, didn't you, at the end of all that? A. Yes. Did he put his fingers in your vagina.

Q. And what did she say?

A. No.”

She confirmed that the complainant had said nothing to her at the hospital about the appellant’s squeezing her wrist.


	
	The mother was released from hospital on 20 August and, some three days later, spoke to the appellant. He was then in gaol and asked her to find him some more accommodation. She refused, accusing him of touching the girls. He denied this in emphatic language and the conversation was quickly over. On the following day the mother took both girls to the Cessnock Community Centre where they were interviewed by the police.
	
	
	She said that she asked the girls whether they had ever been touched by the appellant. Both said no, the older daughter adding an emphatic comment.
	
	
	So far as her father’s criminal history was concerned, the mother’s evidence was, in substance, that she had shielded the children from that matter because she was concerned that it might adversely affect their attitude towards their grandfather. She did become aware that the girls found out some time in 2009 from their cousin that he had been convicted of murder (called a domestic murder). At this time the family was living at Cessnock. So far as the mother was aware, the girls had not known of their grandfather’s past whilst they were living in Wagga Wagga. The mother spoke to the girls about the case, though it seems briefly, telling them in substance that it was an accident and that he had done his time and was ok. She did not recall that the complainant was upset about it. She did not think that she told the complainant anything about the appellant getting into trouble for touching girls at a sports carnival.
	
	
	Moving forward to 2010, the appellant had breached his parole, which put him back in prison. When he was about to be released, he asked her for help with accommodation. The mother wished to help him in this regard but, although she was quite willing to have him stay with her and the girls, the accommodation was not suitable. She saw no problem with his coming to live close by. Her mother, however, was opposed to the plan saying, “Just be wary of him, I don’t trust him.” She confirmed that her mother had called her when she was in the hospital and said “… [The complainant’s] come clean about your father touching her”.
	
	
	The Crown led further evidence from the investigating police officers but that is not presently material.
	
	
	The appellant did not give evidence and did not call any evidence on his behalf.
	


The applicable directions of law


	
	The requirement for a trial judge to direct himself or herself in accordance with the directions to be given to a jury is imposed by s 133(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which provides as follows –
	


“(1)  A Judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person. Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury.

(2)  A judgment by a Judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied.

(3)  If any Act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the Judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.”

Dealing with an earlier but identical iteration of this provision the High Court said in Fleming v R [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250 –

“[32] The obligation… ‘to take the warning into account’ is not only to be discharged but also to be seen to be discharged. The means by which the obligation may be discharged is that indicated in … [subsection] (2), namely the inclusion in the reasons for judgment of the particular requirement for a warning among the principles of law applied by the judge. The various requirements that warnings be given have been expressed as rules of law or practice … The failure to give such a warning does not always lead to the setting aside of a conviction. But that does not mean that it is not a principle of law within the terms of [subsection] (2). The judge is obliged … to take the warning into account and in doing so the judge applies a principle of law.

[33] The result is to require the recording and heeding of a warning, if one is called for in the particular case, and the giving of effect to it in a real sense by stating reasons why, notwithstanding the warning or as a consequence of it, a particular verdict is reached. A mere recording or statement of it, without more, would amount to an empty incantation. If these criteria are not satisfied in a particular case, then the judge is to be taken as not discharging the obligation imposed … that the warning be taken into account.”

The court cited with approval the statement by McHugh J in Longman v The Queen [1989] HCA 60; (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 107 –

“If, however, the evidence discloses any circumstance which suggests that the evidence of the complainant may be unreliable, the trial judge has a duty to make the jury aware of the dangers concerning that person's evidence. As in any case where the prosecution depends solely upon the evidence of one witness, the trial judge is entitled to point out that the evidence of the complainant requires careful scrutiny before acting upon it. But cases will frequently arise where the circumstances will require a stronger warning. The terms of that warning will depend upon the particular circumstances of the case.”

The court in Fleming went on to deal with the prosecution’s submissions that the warning expressed by the trial judge was sufficient –

“[36] … [The warning was stated as] ‘The Crown case relies solely upon the complainant. If I am unable to accept her evidence beyond reasonable doubt, I must acquit the accused.’

There may be cases where an examination of the reasons given, although they do not contain express reference to a warning, sufficiently discloses that the judge has had regard to the warning. However, the statement just referred to does not satisfy any such criterion.

[37] No doubt consciousness of the importance of such a warning will be of second nature to many judges. However … an animating principle which lies behind the requirements of… [the section] is that criminal justice not only be done but also be seen to be done. The judgment must show expressly or by necessary implication that the warning was taken into account. If the judgment does not do so, a breach of [subsection 3] has occurred. It is no answer that the trial judge is an experienced judge who was well aware of the requirement of a warning and that he or she must have taken the warning into account.”


	
	As has been mentioned above, the particular directions pointed to by the appellant were those submitted to be required by Murray and Crofts. The first of these directions is simply an emphatic application of the onus and standard of proof to a case where the Crown relies essentially on the evidence of one witness.
	
	
	So far as the Crofts direction is concerned, it requires that the trial judge bring to the attention of the jury the relevance of a significant delay, if any, in the making of a complaint. The majority of the Court (186 CLR at 448) cited with approval what might be thought to be the commonsense observation of Barwick CJ (with whom McTiernan, Stephen and Mason JJ agreed) in Kilby v R (1973) 129 CLR 460 at 472, in rejecting a submission that a failure to complain was evidence of consent to the intercourse in question –
	


“In my opinion, quite apart from the fact that there may be many reasons why a complaint is not made, the want of a complaint does not found an inference of consent. It does tell against the consistency of the woman's account and accordingly is clearly relevant to her credibility in that respect.”

As their Honours commented (ibid) it was for the jury to weigh up the possible reasons for a complaint not having been made and the significance, if any, of the delay in complaining.


	
	The appellant also draws attention to s 165A of the Evidence Act 1995, which concerns warnings in relation to children’s evidence. This provision is as follows –
	


“(1)  A judge in any proceeding in which evidence is given by a child before a jury must not do any of the following:

(a)  warn the jury, or suggest to the jury, that children as a class are unreliable witnesses,

(b)  warn the jury, or suggest to the jury, that the evidence of children as a class is inherently less credible or reliable, or requires more careful scrutiny, than the evidence of adults,

(c)  give a warning, or suggestion to the jury, about the unreliability of the particular child’s evidence solely on account of the age of the child,

(d)  in the case of a criminal proceeding — give a general warning to the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of a witness who is a child.

(2)  Subsection (1) does not prevent the judge, at the request of a party, from:

(a)  informing the jury that the evidence of the particular child may be unreliable and the reasons why it may be unreliable, and

(b)  warning or informing the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence of the particular child and the weight to be given to it,

if the party has satisfied the court that there are circumstances (other than solely the age of the child) particular to the child that affect the reliability of the child’s evidence and that warrant the giving of a warning or the information.

(3)  This section does not affect any other power of a judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury.”


	
	The direction sought by counsel for the appellant under s 165A(2) was submitted not to be based solely on the age of the witness but on particular circumstances referred to by counsel. In summary, they were that the complainant was, as a 12 year old, still very young and giving evidence as to an event which occurred some five years previously; her age at the time of the alleged offence was between six and seven years old or seven and eight years old and she might not “have the capacity for clear expression of reliable evidence”; the time that elapsed between the alleged events and the initial disclosure; and the number of instances where the complainant was “unable to remember details about various things”.
	
	
	The appellant relied on the criticism of the High Court in Douglass v R [2012] HCA 34 of the approach taken by the trial judge (sitting without a jury) in relation to the credibility of the complainant. The Court summarised the approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal as follows (omitting references) –
	


“[43] The Court of Criminal Appeal agreed with the trial judge that CD’s initial denials and the inconsistencies between her statements in the interview and on later occasions were explicable on the basis of CD’s young age. However, the court was not prepared to place the same weight on the two factors on which the trial judge relied for his finding that CD was truthful. Doyle CJ, who gave the leading judgment, was not confident that the allegation was one a three year old child was unlikely to make up. Nor was Doyle CJ confident that he would have given as much weight to CD’s firmness in cross-examination as the trial judge had done. Nonetheless, Doyle CJ considered that it had been open to the trial judge to accept CD’s account and to rely on it to reach a finding of guilt. In reaching that conclusion, Doyle CJ said this:

‘One cannot simply say that because [CD] was a three year old one could discard any difficulties with her evidence, accepting and acting on her evidence of the alleged offence. But equally one cannot say that [CD’s] evidence should be assessed in the same way as one would assess the evidence of an adult. Nor could one say that [CD’s] evidence was inherently unreliable because of her age. However, having regard to [CD’s] age, it was open to the Judge to decide that she was truthful and reliable during the interview by the psychologist, which became her evidence, despite the problems with that evidence that [the appellant’s counsel] identified’.”

In its consideration of this reasoning, the High Court said –

“[46] In the passage set out earlier in these reasons, the Court of Criminal Appeal said that one could not discard any difficulties with CD’s evidence simply because she was a three year old. In the same passage, the court went on to say that having regard to CD’s age it had been open to the judge to decide she was truthful and reliable despite the problems with her evidence. The court did not explain how the two propositions were to be reconciled. How was the judge to arrive at a state of satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt of the reliability of CD’s statements in the interview given that the limited detail of the allegation was supplied in response to leading questions and only after initial denials? Those statements were the only evidence of the commission of the offence.

[47] In later statements, CD gave inconsistent accounts of the scene of the offence. It is understandable that CD may have been confused when she was shown the plan of her great-grandmother’s property and asked to identify the shed. Nonetheless, the fact that CD gave three different accounts of the scene of the offence cannot be dismissed in any assessment of her reliability as an historian.

[48] The criminal standard of proof is a designedly exacting standard. A different, lesser, standard is applied by courts dealing with contested issues involving the care and protection of children. This was not such a proceeding. In the circumstances of this trial, it was an error for the Court of Criminal Appeal to hold that it had been open to the trial judge to be satisfied of the reliability of CD’s statements in the interview and to reason from that, despite the appellant’s denials, to a conclusion that his guilt had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.”


	
	The appellant submits that his Honour made an allowance for the complainant in the way which was thus criticised.
	
	
	It is scarcely necessary to cite any authority for the proposition that reversing the onus of proof in the sense of requiring the defence to lead evidence suggestive of, let alone establishing, a reasonable doubt is a fundamental error.
	
	
	There is a further important direction that is always given to juries when explaining their role as judges of the facts. They are directed that, as a result of their function, although they should have regard to what is said to them about the facts and the inferences that might flow from them by counsel or, for that matter, by the judge, it is for them to decide what facts are important and what facts are not. They may consider that a fact not mentioned at all could be important, perhaps decisive, whilst facts or reasoning of which much is made, they might think to be unimportant. This requirement to weigh the whole of the evidence, whatever may be submitted to them by counsel or mentioned by the trial judge, is of the very essence of the jury’s function.
	


The judgment at trial


	
	After setting out the charges and the matters comprising the elements of the offence, namely the appellant putting his hand down the complainant’s pants and touching the outside of her vagina which comprised the indecent assault and squeezing her on the wrists to overcome her resistance, the learned trial judge referred in narrative terms to the requirements of s 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 in respect of the applicable warnings. The first particular direction his Honour gave himself was described as a “Markuleski direction”, a reference to, as I take it, the judgment of Spiegelman CJ in R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at [186] as to the requirement that each count be treated separately being supplemented, in a word against word case, by a direction to the “effect upon the assessment of the credibility of a complainant if the jury finds itself unable to accept the complainant’s evidence in respect to any count”. Having regard to his Honour’s findings, there was no occasion to consider the possible significance of different conclusions as to the guilt of the appellant on each count and this was not the subject of any complaint on the appeal.
	
	
	The trial judge then went on to summarise the evidence of the complainant, concluding in this respect –
	


“The complainant was cross-examined by a public defender, Mr King, for the accused. To my mind she was completely unshaken in her evidence. My impression after hearing her evidence was that she was believable witness who is doing her best to tell the truth about something that had actually happened in her life.

Mr King conceded that much of the job of the tribunal of fact here would depend upon assessment of the complainant and her evidence. That assessment includes an assessment of the demeanour of the complainant.

A submission was made to me that she appeared to be someone who was relating a story rather than someone recounting something that had happened to them. I do not discount that submission but frankly it was not my impression. It must be remembered that she was recounting something that had happened many years before. She was not emotional about her evidence although at times she was shy about saying exactly what had happened.

Of course if, as was suggested by the accused, this was a total

fabrication, it is difficult to understand her reaction to the questioning when she displayed some reluctance to provide exact details of where she had been touched. See question 43.

It could be suggested that she was coached into giving the performance she gave including appearing at times to be shy when she provided her account to police. In fact there was a hint of an allegation of concoction or joint concoction in the submissions of counsel. But I note that those submissions carry little weight, in my view.

The suggestion is that her grandmother and perhaps her mother -although I understand that counsel might have pulled back from that suggestion now - have engineered a complaint from the complainant. Neither the complainant nor the grandmother were cross-examined on this suggestion. That might not be fatal to the making of the submission, but in my view it detracts significantly from its weight. I do not accept it and I do not accept it because I could not see any hint of it in the evidence of the complainant.

Let me provide an example why I say that I did not see any hint of such a concoction. The complainant was asked what the accused was wearing in bed. She said blue jeans. I find it very difficult to accept that a concocted version would have included that detail, particularly if the version was given to her by an adult

It is of course possible that she simply made up that detail, but again that was not my impression of the complainant. To the contrary, the evidence has the ring of truth about it.

The Crown, in his address, provided another reason to doubt the complainant was recounting a concocted account. As noted in the summary of the complainant’s evidence outlined above, the complainant was adamant that she was touched on the outside of her vagina, not the inside. If this was a concocted story engineered by the grandmother or her mother, why would that detail be part of the story? It would have been simple to make a more serious allegation and the adults would have understood that. In the context of a jointly concocted allegation, it makes little sense.

By addressing the issues in this way, a question can arise as to whether I have fallen into error by suggesting to myself a simplistic question like, ""Why would the complainant lie?"" In my view, it is entirely appropriate to look at what motives might appear in the evidence or the submissions as to why the complainant might have concocted a story implicating the accused. What cannot be done is to suggest that it was up to the accused to establish such a motive. It was not up to the accused to prove anything. In relation to the motive as to why someone would concoct a story against him, he might simply be unable to nominate any such reason.

The accused has denied his involvement in the offences by his plea and also expressly when the matter was put to him by the complainant's mother. He did not give evidence before me but no inference adverse to him can be drawn from that fact. It does not lend any weight to the Crown case, it does not fill any gaps that might be perceived to exist in the evidence.

The accused's denial is sufficient for the Court to pursue a close examination of the complainant's evidence and any other evidence supporting her evidence because that is the evidence that must be established beyond reasonable doubt before the accused can be convicted of anything.

However, that does not make the examination of possible motives for the complainant to lie suggested in the evidence and submissions inappropriate. To the contrary, it is a necessary part of the examination of the evidence.

The fact that I found the complainant a believable witness does not mean that I ought to find the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt. As was rightly pointed out by the accused's counsel, there are a number of additional considerations to be taken into account before I could reach that conclusion.

As with a jury trial, a judge sitting alone must give himself or herself the directions that it would have been appropriate to give a jury. It would only be after hearing those directions and considering their content that I will be in a position to revisit my consideration of the complainant's evidence.

The matters dealt with in the warnings flow directly from the onus on the Crown and from the fact that the complainant's evidence is, in effect, the sole evidence in the case. In any such case, the judge in a trial must warn the jury, and in this case I must take into account a warning that when the complainant's evidence stands alone as making out the Crown case, her evidence must be scrutinised with great care before it can be accepted as a sufficient basis to establish the facts in a case beyond reasonable doubt.

In that regard it is necessary to take into account any weaknesses in her evidence. Those weaknesses might include contradictions in her evidence with other evidence that the Court accepts it should prefer over her evidence.”


	
	It was submitted on the appellant’s behalf that the trial judge’s reference to his impression of the complainant as “a believable witness” was a premature finding of credibility and, because what might be called the cautionary warnings such as the Murray direction were mentioned at a later stage, the process was to make a favourable finding and then to test whether that finding should be changed by applying the warnings was to be reverse the appropriate order of reasoning.
	
	
	It was submitted that the judge’s approach to the issue of credibility was foreshadowed by an observation made during the closing submissions of defence counsel. That occurred as follows. Mr King had drawn the judge’s attention to the mother’s evidence that, at the time of the kitchen renovations, the accused was not staying over at the house but came in the morning and left in the evenings after dinner. The submission proceeded –
	


“I submit your Honour that this evidence significantly undermines … [the complainant's] evidence because if her evidence is accepted and if the assault occurred just after the kitchen was finished then the assault occurred at a time when the accused was not living in the house and therefore [he] would and could not have been present at the house early in the morning in his bed to commit that crime.

HIS HONOUR: Wearing his jeans.

KING: That's what she said. But my point is your Honour-

HIS HONOUR: It doesn't strike you as going to bed sort of stuff does it really?

KING: No.

HIS HONOUR: More like somebody's arrived to do some work on the kitchen, got into his bed and pulled her into the room at that time.

KING: Well--

HIS HONOUR: So - I'm giving you this opportunity. Normally you wouldn't have anybody speak to you.

KING: No, no. That's--

HIS HONOUR: But I'm giving you this opportunity to address that specifically because to me that seems a fairly significant piece of evidence as well

KING: Well--

HIS HONOUR: There's nothing you can do much with it but--

KING: No there's not. It can't be said to be impossible but certainly there was nothing in the evidence of the mother that suggested that he was a man who arriving to work goes back to bed. She said he got out of bed very early and got on with work.

HIS HONOUR: But she also says that she was in bed, so.

KING: She was in bed, she doesn't - she can't say about that day but she knows about her - she knows pretty well about her father's habits and that is he's a man who springs out of bed at 5.30 in the morning, not someone who is prone to laying around in bed.

HIS HONOUR: But as will be obvious to you, he has opportunity then. He knows what her habits are, he knows she doesn't get out of bed until eight. He's up early, he's working on the house, he's obviously got access at any stage, he’s dressed for work when he allegedly calls this girl into bed. It doesn't seem entirely impossible that this occurred at a time when he was working on the kitchen or thereafter.

KING: Well your Honour is making an assumption - it may be a reasonable assumption but it is an assumption - about Mr Cawthray's sleeping paraphernalia habits. Most people don't sleep in jeans but it's not impossible

HIS HONOUR: All right. Okay. That's probably as good as it can get I guess.

KING: Thank you.

HIS HONOUR: I'll make a note of that thanks.” (Emphasis added).

It is submitted that the trial judge had taken a position on this issue, which was significant to an assessment of the complainant’s credibility, before he had applied the cautionary warnings and that this conclusion was maintained through to the end of his judgment, despite those warnings.


	
	I do not accept that these matters, of themselves, show any error, certainly not of prejudgment. The passage in the judgment relied on by the appellant certainly dealt with his impression of the complainant as a witness. The judge made a specific reference to her demeanour and how she “appeared” to him. Assuming that, indeed, this was his Honour’s starting point, it does not suggest any error. On the contrary, it was a sensible commencement of his Honour’s discussion of the issues in the case. Had his impression been that the complainant was a dishonest witness, for example, it would scarcely have been necessary for his Honour to proceed with a detailed analysis of the evidence although, no doubt, it would have been appropriate for him to identify those matters, if any, which were contained in her evidence and that suggested such a conclusion. Nor did his Honour’s impression of the witness of itself suggest that, despite that impression, a close analysis of her evidence was unnecessary in order to consider appropriately whether, not only the impression were mistaken but also whether, despite the complainant’s apparent sincerity, her evidence as to the crucial elements could not be regarded as reliable. For that contention to succeed, it is necessary to consider the manner in which his Honour dealt with the evidence of the complainant as to the facts.
	
	
	The cautionary warning as to close scrutiny of a complainant’s evidence is directed, of course, not only to any what might be called objective problems with it, such as inconsistencies, unlikelihoods, mistakes or inaccuracies but also to the way she presented as a witness. As has been said many times, one has to be careful about drawing conclusions from appearances. Thus, it was, with respect, not inappropriate for the judge to state at the outset his view of how the complainant presented as a witness.
	
	
	Dealing with the argument that the complaint was concocted on the instigation of the complainant’s grandmother and possibly her mother, the judge rejected it, in part no doubt because of his view about her demeanour, which he described as “guileless”, but particularly by reference to two matters: the first was the complainant’s evidence about the appellant wearing blue jeans at the time (as distinct, I think, from pyjamas or perhaps some other attire usually worn by the appellant when he went to bed); and, secondly, the complainant having been “adamant that she was touched on the outside of her vagina and not on the inside”, as it “would have been simple to make a more serious allegation and the adults would have understood that”. His Honour then went on to explain that he had not approached this question by asking, simplistically, “why would the complainant lie” but considered that it was entirely appropriate to look at whether the evidence disclosed any motive that might suggest concoction. His Honour rightly observed that it was wrong to look to the accused to establish any such motive and commented that, of course, (if there were such a motive) he might simply be unable to identify it. The suggested motive was instigation by the grandmother, either by actually making the suggestion to the complainant or the implicit repeated suggestion by questioning about interference by the appellant, thus encouraging the making of a false complaint to satisfy this questioning. The matters to which his Honour referred demonstrated, to his mind, that the complaint had not been concocted.
	
	
	It is important to note, however, that merely to have rejected the possibility of concoction does not at all determine the question of reliability. A witness might well believe that he or she is recounting an event that occurred but that memory may be mistaken, not only as to details but as to whether the event actually occurred. Thus, it is also necessary (dealing with the evidence in this case) to focus on the nature of the alleged event, the circumstances in which it was said to have occurred, the lapse in time before it is recounted, the reasons for delay in recounting it, the significance of any earlier denials that it happened, consistency in the various accounts, descriptions of surrounding or connected facts and the age and maturity of the complainant both at the time of the alleged event and the time of it being reported.
	
	
	Having stated his view of the complainant’s demeanour, the judge then referred to the appellant’s denial of committing any offence, in effect by his plea and also when the complainant’s mother accused him. His Honour noted that the appellant had given no evidence but said (rightly, of course) that no adverse inference could be drawn from this, that it did not add anything to the Crown case and did not fill any gaps that might exist in the evidence. His Honour then said –
	


“The accused’s denial is sufficient for the court to pursue a close examination of the complainant’s evidence and any other evidence supporting her evidence because that is the evidence that must be established beyond reasonable doubt before the accused can be convicted of anything.”

This passage was the subject of a critical submission by counsel for the appellant but it seems to me that nothing significant arises from it. The mere plea of not guilty places in issue all the elements of the offence, whatever an accused might have said, and requires the close examination of the evidence to which his Honour referred. The point is that his Honour accepted that the Crown bore the onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt and a close examination of the evidence was essential.


	
	Importantly, in light of the complaints made here on the appellant’s behalf, his Honour then said –
	


“The fact that I found the complainant a believable witness does not mean that I ought to find the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt. As was rightly pointed out by the accused's counsel, there are a number of additional considerations to be taken into account before I could reach that conclusion.

As with a jury trial, a judge sitting alone must give himself or herself the directions that it would have been appropriate to give a jury. It would only be after hearing those directions and considering their content that I will be in a position to revisit my consideration of the complainant's evidence.

The matters dealt with in the warnings flow directly from the onus on the Crown and from the fact that the complainant's evidence is, in effect, the sole evidence in the case. In any such case, the judge in a trial must warn the jury, and in this case I must take into account a warning that when the complainant's evidence stands alone as making out the Crown case, her evidence must be scrutinised with great care before it can be accepted as a sufficient basis to establish the facts in a case beyond reasonable doubt.

In that regard it is necessary to take into account any weaknesses in her evidence. Those weaknesses might include contradictions in her evidence with other evidence that the Court accepts it should prefer over her evidence.”

It seems to me, with respect, that there is no error in the question posed by the judge in the first paragraph quoted above. Nor, does it seem to me that there is any reversal of the onus of proof in his Honour’s reference to the need to revisit the complainant’s evidence bearing in mind the cautionary directions. The passage, taken as a whole, does not suggest to me that his Honour had prejudged, let alone, dismissed the question of the complainant’s reliability.


	
	The judge went on to mention the significance of the issue concerning the timing of the kitchen renovation, to which he said he would return. He referred to the complainant’s denials to her mother of any touching by the appellant, and to the submission of defence counsel “that those denials should at least cause the court to have a significant doubt about the veracity of the complainant’s account”.
	
	
	His Honour then went on to state –
	


“It was submitted that perhaps there is a question about the reliability of the complainant’s evidence, but I do not accept that in reality the issues here can be addressed in that way. There is no question that the complainant has related what she said was a memory of an incident. The reality is that the event either happened or it did not. She has not made a significant mistake about that event.

Is it possible that she has misapprehended when the event took place or some other even less significant detail? That is possible but even if that is so it may not necessarily detract greatly from the truth of the disclosure made because of the nature of the disclosure.

Of course, very significant error in that regard might cause a tribunal of fact to question the existence of the basal fact, but I do not perceive that to be the situation here. (Emphasis mine).

The accused submitted that I should have some concerns about the evidence of the complainant due to her age at the time when the disclosure was made. Of course, it was not submitted that that I should necessarily be concerned about her age at the time when the alleged event took place because to make that submission acknowledges that some event must have taken place. The accused denies any such event.”

The judge then went on to mention the issue of age, limiting it to the delay in complaint (answered by the appellant’s telling her not to tell anyone) and the prejudice to the accused arising from the delay and then deal with the complainant having been “asked continually about whether the accused interfered with her … [which] she denied …” and the submission that the complainant might have been encouraged to make a false complaint to satisfy her grandmother’s questioning of her. The judgment then continues –

“[These matters] cannot be ignored … [but if] this was a complaint that was fabricated by a twelve year old child, it has very strange content indeed … In my assessment there was simply no guile in the complainant when I saw her give evidence.

I reject the possibility that her account was fabricated in the manner suggested by counsel.”


	
	The first paragraph in the passage quoted immediately above can be read in two ways. The most likely is that the complainant “has not made a significant mistake” about whether the incident occurred or not, in the sense that she has not confabulated. The judge rejected approaching the question of the “veracity [ie truthfulness] of the complainant’s account by testing its reliability, considering “that in reality the issues here [cannot] be addressed in that way”, there being “no question that the complainant has related what she said was a memory of an incident”.
	
	
	Defence counsel had submitted that the complainant’s evidence “lacks real probative value and may not be reliable” pointing out that it was given by a 12 year old girl recounting an event which she said occurred up to five and half years earlier when she was perhaps six years of age. He added –
	


“… the evidence given by … [the complainant] concerns a child aged … somewhere between six and seven years old and on her evidence, which differs and may itself demonstrate some unreliability, between seven and eight years of age. Children of those very young years do not always have the capacity for clear expression of reliable evidence.”


	
	Counsel said that he did not submit that the evidence was automatically unreliable by virtue of age but the question of age would weigh in the judge’s mind “when considering how much weight can be placed on” it. The gap was also, counsel submitted, a fact which may itself demonstrate some unreliability which would erode confidence that the complainant “was able to give an honest, but perhaps in this context more importantly, accurate version of what happened sometime back in 2005 or 2006” (emphasis mine), adding –
	


“Put another way, it seems that whatever happened to … [the complainant] if anything in 2005 or 2006 bubbled away in her head completely unexpressed for up to five and a half years before being spoken of for the first time, apparently in August 2008. I submit that that would test any tribunal of fact’s unreserved belief about any like evidence but, given the age of the complainant at the time and at the time of disclosure I submit that in this case there are a number of real and substantial reasons why your Honour would be slow to come to any unreserved acceptance of her account.”


	
	Counsel referred to the details which either could not be remembered or were differently described in the various accounts, the difficulty with dating the offence, the errors about where the appellant was living at the time and a number of other features including in particular what was submitted to be a vague description of the “actual mechanism of the assault … peppered with ‘I don’t know’ and ‘I don’t remember’, that much is to be expected from a version of events looking back to five years ago by a young child.” Various other matters were referred to by counsel to support this argument.
	
	
	It is clear, therefore, that the reliability question was not posed merely as whether the complainant believed she was telling the truth or otherwise had concocted the story either by herself or at the instigation or with the connivance of her grandmother or mother. The case for the appellant was simple, namely that the event in question had not occurred. Counsel on his behalf put matters to the trial judge arising both from the complainant’s evidence and, in particular, that of her mother which questioned the complainant’s reliability. Of course, unreliability did not matter of itself but only if it raised the reasonable possibility that no incident as alleged occurred. Counsel’s submission was not a mere commentary on matters said to indicate unreliability. The point of counsel’s submission was that the judge would have a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant, in other words, a reasonable doubt that the offence had been committed, because of the matters to which he referred. The distinction between honesty and accuracy was an important element of counsel’s address, although he did not refer to confabulation as such. The appellant denied that the event occurred. It was not necessary for the appellant to formulate an explanation for the (on this hypothesis) false complaint being made.
	
	
	In deciding that the complainant was relating an event present in her memory about which she was not mistaken, and rejecting the possibility that the matters that suggested unreliability might demonstrate a doubt about the reliability of her belief, the judge depended, as I read the judgment, entirely upon his view of her demeanour as a witness. This, with respect, is a non sequitur. That the complainant genuinely believed that the incident occurred cannot demonstrate that the incident actually occurred. Of course, it is cogent evidence of that fact but it was necessary to consider whether the evidence as to unreliability raised the reasonable possibility that she was mistaken. However, the judge summarily dismissed approaching the evidence with this in view and focussed on the question whether she had concocted the allegation, which was the only remaining issue.
	
	
	It seems to me, with respect, that his Honour’s focus on the possibility of concoction erred in that it overlooked the possibility that the event did not take place as described by the complainant but that she had confabulated. Put otherwise, the variations in details of the offence itself, the mistakes about the kitchen renovation and when the appellant resided at the home, the likelihood that complainant’s recollection about her attitude towards the appellant whilst the family lived in Wagga Wagga was a construction, not to speak of the denials of misconduct by the appellant, are more reasonably explained by the possibility that no misconduct took place as the appellant believed and she had confabulated some other innocent event. When are added the facts that the alleged event occurred when the complainant was six or seven and she first mentioned it five years later, it was even more important, to my mind, that the fact-finder consider this issue. Merely to conclude that the complainant was “guileless” could not, in the circumstances here, resolve the issue of unreliability.
	
	
	The penultimate paragraph (italicised) in the passage quoted above is, with respect, problematical. The reference to the “basal fact” is, as it seems to me, a reference to the indecent assault. Its existence might be doubted – as his Honour appears to be reasoning – if significant errors detracted from the “truth of the disclosure”. This does suggest to me that the judge may indeed have approached the matter by deciding that the complainant’s evidence was not only truthful but accurate (in the sense that she had been indecently assaulted by the appellant as she described) and then see whether there were any “very significant errors” that might bring that accuracy into question. But the necessary scrutiny cannot commence with an assumption about accuracy, though it was reasonable to start with the conclusion about sincerity. It was necessary to analyse the contradictory evidence to weigh its significance, bearing in mind that a mistake cannot confirm accuracy. Moreover, the existence of a fact might be doubted because of circumstances not comprising “errors”, here, in particular, the age of the complainant at the time of the alleged offence and at the time it was reported, the denials of its occurrence, the description of the assault and how it happened.
	
	
	The error had its compounding effect in the passage immediately following those quoted above –
	


“The accused submitted that I should have some concerns about the evidence of the complainant due to her age at the time the disclosure was made. Of course, it was not submitted that I should necessarily be concerned about her age at the time when the alleged event took place because to make that submission acknowledges that some event must have taken place. The accused denies any such event.”

In fact, as the above quoted parts of Mr King’s submission demonstrates, the age of the complainant at the time of the alleged event as well as her age at the time of disclosure were important. To do so, in no way contradicted or qualified the contention that no indecent assault occurred, but led to the question whether the complainant had recalled some incident that had not involved indecent assault but which she now mistakenly believed did so.


	
	Counsel then went on to deal with the submitted difficulty of the complainant in remembering details, including details of the event itself.
	
	
	His Honour then dealt extensively with the possibility that the complainant’s view of the appellant might have been poisoned by the knowledge of the accusations against the appellant in respect of other sexually related offences, which had given rise to the mother asking the complainant whether the appellant had interfered with her, which she denied. In dealing with the contention that repeated suggestions to the child implied in the questioning of her as to whether she was interfered with by the appellant could have encouraged her to falsify a complaint in order to satisfy her grandmother, his Honour said –
	


“In my view, whilst that cannot be ignored, it merely highlights the need for a close examination of the actual complaint. If this was a complaint that was fabricated by a twelve year old child it has very strange content indeed. Moreover, it provides details that one would not expect in such a complaint and the complainant has been consistent even under cross-examination, in repeating the complaint. In my assessment, there is simply not guile in the complainant when I saw her evidence. I reject the possibility that her account was fabricated in the manner suggested as possible by counsel.”


	
	This again focused on the possibility of fabrication. But, as I have mentioned, this was not the only possibility.
	
	
	The judge then dealt with the evidence of the complainant as to when the event occurred in relation to the kitchen renovations. His Honour briefly referred to the mother’s evidence in this regard, which he accepted, he concluded “that the complainant was simply wrong when she said that the appellant lived in the house at the time”. His Honour considered that this did make her evidence unreliable but not in a way that significantly detracted from the reliability of the disclosure since, his Honour said, the question as to when the kitchen was completed would not “have been a prominent issue … when she related her complaint which dates from some five years previously.” The information was provided when she was asked about it by the police in an attempt to give some timeframe for the charges. His Honour pointed out that there was no evidence that the appellant’s former bedroom was not still being used by him at times, especially when he was at the home working on the kitchen. However, there was no evidence at all which suggested that the appellant in fact used the bedroom at any time after he had left the house. Nor was there any evidence as to the time he came to the house when he worked on the kitchen or, indeed, after he had left the house. The evidence of the complainant was categorical, that he was living at the house when the offence occurred and referred to the “stuff” of the appellant on the bedside table. She did not say that it occurred whilst he was building the kitchen but to the police and later confirmed in her evidence that it was when he had just finished the kitchen. His Honour thought it was significant that the appellant was, according to the complainant, dressed in blue jeans and a tank top since this was unlikely had he slept in the bed, and concluded that it was most likely that the appellant was dressed for work at the time that the alleged event took place. The notion that, being dressed in blue jeans and a tank top, he was dressed for work had no evidentiary basis and therefore the conclusion that it was likely that the appellant was working on the kitchen at the time of the alleged offence, despite the evidence of the complainant that he was not, was necessarily speculative.
	
	
	Once the conclusion was reached that the event occurred when the appellant had left the home, it was necessary to consider the evidence as to his access to the house at that time. It was not contested that he helped with the kitchen renovations but there was no evidence at all as to the time of his attendance at the home during this time, except – if the alleged assault occurred then – from the complainant’s evidence that it happened at 8am. Nor was there any evidence that the appellant had access to the home before the mother rose. In an exchange with counsel, the judge said, “He’s up early, he’s working on the house, he’s obviously got access at any stage”. There is no evidence that the appellant did have such access, unless of course, the evidence of the complainant is accepted, but then the finding as to access does not in any way support her evidence. The error was not pointed out by counsel and, as it happens, is not mentioned in the judgment. However, the question of access to the house was plainly highly significant. The omission to address it indicates to my mind that his Honour had assumed that it was not an issue.
	
	
	The only evidence as to the appellant’s time of rising concerned the period when he was living there. The evidence as to his visiting the home after he left came from the mother and went no further than that he came for a cup of tea and stayed for an evening meal. There was no evidence at all (except from the complainant, who thought he was still living at the house) from which it could be inferred that he came to the home in the early morning at any time.
	
	
	Defence counsel had submitted that the complainant’s evidence that she was very angry with the appellant as a result of the assault was contradicted by the mother’s evidence that there was no change in her demeanour towards the appellant around that time. The judge, however, rejected this contention upon the basis that, if the event occurred after the appellant had left the house, “there might not have been much more than sporadic contact between the two of them after that time” and, therefore, this matter was not significant. However, the only evidence on this point came from the mother. As mentioned above, she said he visited almost every day and stayed for dinner, the complainant would spend time with him; and their relationship “was a perfectly normal loving relationship” whilst the appellant lived at the house and after he moved out. There might be reasons that the young victim of a sexual assault might not wish to change his or her behaviour towards the perpetrator. As is obvious, his Honour did not need (on his mistaken view of the evidence) to deal with them. There was here the additional difficulty that the complainant said that her attitude did change “and I didn’t want to see him again”.
	
	
	Having rejected the submission that time was of the essence and the offence may have allegedly occurred after the 30 September 2006 date specified in the indictment (to which I will come later), the judge moved to the submissions of Mr King as to the differing accounts of the complainant to her grandmother, mother and as given in evidence. He considered that these accounts were not markedly different, pointing out that, had they been identical then the suggestion that the allegation was concocted would have been enlivened. The crucial question, of course, was whether those differences were significant in terms of accepting the reliability of the complainant. His Honour concluded, as I understand it, because they were not “markedly different” they did not reflect adversely on the reliability of the complainant’s evidence. It was a matter for the trial judge to assess the importance of the differences between the complaints. It is very much a matter of judgment whether those differences were or were not important. At the same time, as I mentioned above, the inconsistencies could not strengthen the complainant’s reliability.
	
	
	The judge then dealt with the delay and complaint. His Honour pointed out that the complainant was a young girl at the time and her mother was close by. He referred to her evidence that she did not complain because the appellant told her not to tell her mother or anyone else and, also, due to things she later learned about the appellant from a cousin which she described as “disgusting”. His Honour pointed out that it was not possible to know exactly what the complainant was told about the appellant but it was unlikely, he considered, that she knew that the appellant had served a prison term for murdering his former wife. His Honour referred to the direction from the appellant and to her knowledge that her mother was supportive of the appellant who would have been able to stay with them had there been room in the house where they then lived. The trial judge considered that there was therefore pressure on the complainant not to make trouble with the grandfather but when she learned that he was already in trouble for sexually interfering with someone else, the pressure was relieved and his Honour referred to her saying that she felt more comfortable in the circumstances revealing what had happened to her. Part of the difficulty with this reasoning is that the complainant had not referred at all to any pressure on her coming from her mother not to make trouble with her grandfather; nor did the mother give any evidence to this effect. This was supposition. In R v LTP [2004] NSWCCA 109 at [132] Simpson J observed that “judges should not volunteer explanations, particularly where the complainant has actually given reasons for not complaining” citing R v Williams (1999) 104 A Crim R 260 per Wood CJ at CL at [26]. Although this was said in the context of a direction to the jury on the issue of complaint, it plainly applies to the process of reasoning of a judge sitting alone.
	
	
	The judge then referred to the legislative requirement of reminding himself that there might be many reasons why a complainant does not complain. He pointed out that she was very young and might have been quite unsure about what to do at the time. The difficulty with this explanation is that it is clear from her evidence that the reason she gave for not going to her mother or anyone else was that the appellant had told her not to do so. This was not therefore a case of confusion but, rather, one of obeying the appellant’s instruction.
	
	
	The judge stated then that he had scrutinised the complainant’s evidence thoroughly, paying particular regard to the submissions of counsel and the other witnesses. He noted that there were some areas of her evidence where she was in conflict with other witnesses, thinking that the most significant was the question as to whether the kitchen was completed at the time of the alleged assault. Following a brief description of the manner in which he approached his task which does not call for present discussion, his Honour concluded –
	


“In my view, the complainant gave straightforward and believable evidence when she said that her grandfather pulled her into his bed and indecently assaulted her. I am of the view that her evidence should be accepted by me beyond reasonable doubt, even after having scrutinised her evidence thoroughly.

In addition I accept beyond reasonable doubt that the accused held her wrists when she resisted him.”


	
	It seems to me that it is fair to describe the trial judge’s approach as starting with his impression of the complainant as a witness of truth and then analysing particular matters arising both in her evidence and that of her mother and grandmother in particular to see whether those matters reflected adversely on the impression he had formed of her. In dealing with each of the criticisms in that way, it does not seem to me that his Honour erred. Furthermore although his Honour did not in terms say so, in my view it is clear that he considered what might be called the detracting or adverse matters as a whole. I am satisfied that the trial judge did consider whether the complainant was both truthful and reliable. However, as I have said, he considered reliability only in relation to the possibility that the complainant had fabricated the accusation against the appellant and was giving a deliberately dishonest account. As I have pointed out, although this was the way in which the matter was argued, it was in my view incumbent on his Honour to consider all reasonable possibilities open on the evidence that might give rise to a reasonable doubt about his guilt. I have mentioned that the trial judge accepted the evidence of the complainant’s mother as to significant matters about which the complainant’s evidence was wrong. However, his Honour formed the view that although her evidence was unreliable as to those matters, this did not reflect adversely on her honesty. The question is not fundamentally different when considering whether the complainant’s evidence was reliable in respect of her description of the alleged indecency. Again, it might be honest but unreliable. That was the sense of unreliability which his Honour was also obliged to consider but did not.
	


The significance of time


	
	As mentioned above, the indictment charged the appellant with an offence said to have occurred between 1 May 2005 and 30 September 2006. In his address, the Crown prosecutor adverted to the evidence that suggested that the relevant timeframe might have commenced in July or August of 2004 when the appellant arrived at the house in Wagga Wagga where the complainant was then living and 30 September 2006 when the appellant moved to other premises. He repeated several times that the alleged assault occurred whilst the appellant was living in the complainant’s home. It is important, as it seems to me, that the offence was framed not only as occurring between dates but, more importantly as having occurred whilst the appellant was living at the premises. Indeed the dates were, as the prosecutor explained, chosen by reference to the residence of the appellant with the complainant and her family. The renovation of the kitchen was important because the complainant herself fixed the offence as having occurred before that event but, as the prosecution submitted, if the judge found (as indeed his Honour did) that the kitchen was renovated after the appellant left the premises, that would not affect the Crown case, not because the offence occurred at a later time but because an error in the date of the renovations was a mistake which did not affect the complainant’s credibility. It is clear from the evidence as to the appellant’s visits to the complainant’s home after he stopped living there that it was not the Crown case that he might have been there early in the morning before the complainant’s mother rose. This is the only sensible explanation for the prosecutor not asking the mother about the time when the appellant would arrive at the home or about his access to the house in the early morning before the mother rose and what the arrangements were for him coming to the house at the time of the kitchen renovations. Not surprisingly, defence counsel did not ask any questions of the mother as to the appellant’s visits after his departure. It was clear that this evidence was irrelevant. Moreover, the prosecutor commenced his case by tendering the complainant’s interview with police, in which she clearly said that the assault occurred whilst the appellant was living at the home and he did not seek any correction. The complainant’s certainty on this issue was confirmed by her recollection that her mother was ignorant of the assault whilst he lived at the home: she was asked how long the appellant was “still living with you after the time that [the assault] happened” and replied “Um, probably about a year or two… ‘cause mum didn’t know. She thought it was all ok.” So the assault was dated not only by the fact that the appellant was still living at the house but also by the year or so that he continued to live there whilst the complainant was keeping his misconduct a secret from her mother. The prosecutor took the complainant through the sketch map of the house which she had prepared during the interview and identified the room where the assault occurred as the appellant’s room. This is inconsistent (though it might possibly be explained away) with his no longer living at the premises. In cross-examination the complainant confirmed that the appellant had his own room. Indeed, Mr King cross-examined the complainant to confirm the facts she had related to the police as to this matter.
	
	
	The prosecutor, in his closing address, made it quite clear that the Crown case was that the offence occurred during the period when the appellant was living in the home and not after he had left. This was so regardless of when the renovations occurred. The relevant passage is –
	


“One thing that is certain, in my submission to your Honour on the evidence, is that the girl was quite clear that in fact the incident or the assault occurred when the grandfather (Poppy, the accused) was in his bed and you will recall that she described his state of dress in the interview with the Police. I’ll come to that in a moment, it was in the morning when he was living with them.

So we would submit that there were three instances where … [the complainant] would have a memory of her Poppy and they would be as follows: one is in the period when he came to live with them when he came out on parole; secondly, when he came to visit to have coffee after he’d left there in September 2006; and thirdly - and I don’t know that there’s any evidence from the girl about this - when he went to visit them in Cessnock. You will recall the evidence that he didn’t follow them up there. Now of those three periods, the only period that fits with what the girl is describing and can only fit with that period is that period when the accused of course was first staying with them after he came out on parole from Queensland.”

The prosecutor had indeed referred to the potential for a decision that varied the date on the indictment, but this was a reference only to the commencement date of 1 May 2005.


	
	The approach of both counsel was consistent only with a case in which the Crown alleged that the offence in question occurred whilst the appellant was living at the house. In this sense, the time specified in the indictment, understood as referrable to the dates of the appellant’s residence in the complainant’s home, was indeed of the essence.
	
	
	Defence counsel took the matter up in his final address to his Honour, pointing out that the period in the indictment ran from 1 May 2005 to 30 September 2006 and submitting, in effect, that the evidence did not disclose any assault occurring in that period. He first referred to the complainant’s evidence that, whilst she was not sure, she thought that the assault occurred when she was aged seven or eight. The complainant’s seventh birthday occurred on 13 April 2006 and, of course, remained aged eight until 12 April 2008. Mr King submitted that, in light of the complainant’s mother’s evidence about the timing of the kitchen renovations, that they had occurred after September 2006 at which point the appellant was no longer living in the house. Accordingly, the alleged assault occurred when the accused was no longer living there and “therefore would and could not have been present in the house early in the morning in his bed to commit that crime”. His Honour then interrupted to point out that the way that the appellant was dressed, according to the complainant, indicated that he had “arrived to do some work on the kitchen, got into his bed and pulled her into the room at that time”. Mr King responded that there was nothing in the evidence of the mother to suggest that, having arrived to go to work, he would go back to bed. He submitted that, if the appellant was not living in the house after the kitchen was completed, then it would appear to be impossible that the offence occurred as the complainant asserted.
	
	
	The argument about time is not a technical one. It is, fundamentally, a question of fairness. In R v VHP (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal NSW, 7 July 1997) the complainant gave unequivocal evidence that the offence had occurred on a particular date, although the indictment had specified a range of dates. It was accepted that the jury could not have been satisfied that the offence occurred on the date specified by the complainant because he had associated the sexual activity with events which were proved by objective evidence not to have occurred on the date identified by the complainant. The trial judge gave an equivocal direction which might have led the jury to think that they could nevertheless convict the appellant if they thought the offence had occurred within the range of dates specified in the indictment. Gleeson CJ (with whom Handley JA and Studdert J agreed) accepted the concession made by the Crown in the appeal that, in the way in which the trial was conducted, the jury could not properly have convicted the appellant unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offence occurred on the date stipulated by the complainant. His Honour also pointed out that this was so although the trial judge had correctly instructed the jury that what they made of the complainant’s evidence was a matter for them with the additional instruction that it was always open, in considering the reliability of a witness to accept one part of the witness’ evidence and reject another part. The jury had asked a question showing that the problem upon which they wanted the trial judge’s assistance was whether or not they could convict the appellant even though they were unwilling to accept that the complainant was reliable in his evidence that it occurred on the particular date. The trial judge’s further direction was equivocal so that the jury might have been left with the impression that the date was not vital and that, in order to convict, it was only necessary to decide that the offence had occurred within a range of dates specified in the indictment. Gleeson CJ said –
	


“As a general rule, what the Crown needs to establish in order to obtain a conviction are the essential facts alleged in the indictment, and if the Crown fails to establish an inessential fact, or a particular which has been provided before the trial, or which emerged from the evidence of Crown witnesses, that is not fatal. However, that generalisation may, in any given case, need to be qualified. Two examples of possible qualifications are of present relevance. First, in some circumstances the requirements of procedural or substantive fairness may restrict the capacity of the Crown to depart from particulars. Second, the evidence in a case may be such that it would not be open to a jury, acting reasonably, to treat one part of the Crown case as reliable, and another part as unreliable.

The general rule was stated by Atkin J in Reg v Dossi (1918) 13 Cr App R158 at 159-160 in the following terms:

‘From time immemorial a date specified in an indictment has never been a material matter unless it is actually an essential part of the alleged offence ... Thus, though the date of the offence should be alleged in the indictment, it has never been necessary that it should be laid according to truth unless time is of the essence of the offence.’

There are, however, many examples of cases in which it has been held that time has been made of the essence of the offence, or, to use another expression adopted by judges, has been made vital, by reason of circumstances which give rise to qualifications of the kind mentioned above. (eg The King v Dean [1932] NZLR 753, R v Kringle [1953] Tas SR; R v Pfitzner (1976) 15 SASR 171, R v Macdonald (199G) 84 A Crim R 508, R v Westerman (1991) 55 A Crim R 353).”


	
	In R v Pfitzner (1976) 15 SASR 171 Bray CJ said (at 185) –
	


“Whether the date alleged in an information is vital to the charge must depend on the circumstances. So long as it is clear that the controversy turns on the events of a certain occasion, it

may not matter if the date of that occasion is misstated if the occasion itself is clearly identified and both parties have directed their cases towards it; cf. Page v. Butcher. But obviously if a man is charged with committing an offence on Saturday and comes prepared with an alibi for Saturday, he cannot be convicted of committing the offence on Friday or Sunday, unless perhaps the information is amended and the trial adjourned to enable him to meet the new case.”


	
	In R v Hughes [2000] NSWCCA 3, the allegations against the accused were 20 years old. The complainant had alleged the offences had occurred in a grocery shop in 1979. The accused produced evidence that the grocery shop had not been purchased until 1981. The credibility of the complainant was to be assessed having regard to the place and time at which he said the offences had been committed and became essential to the acceptance of his evidence as reliable in respect of the allegation itself.
	
	
	A similar instance is R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 487; (2000) 118 A Crim R 34. There, the complainant insisted that the offence occurred on the same day as the royal wedding and said that she was 100 percent sure that she witnessed a live broadcast of that ceremony just before the commission of the offence. Other credible evidence contradicted this possibility although it was consistent with the possibility that the offence had occurred (contrary to the complainant’s evidence) some three days later when a replay of the royal wedding was broadcast. Studdert J (with whom Heydon JA and James J agreed) said –
	


“[33] …The complainant's evidence as to the commission of the first offence made the time of such commission essential to the acceptance of her evidence and was crucial in the sense referred to by Gleeson CJ in R v VHP [supra, in the passage cited above]…

[34] It does not seem to me that it was possible to treat the complainant's evidence as reliable as to the commission of the offence if it was not reliable as to the date upon which she said it occurred. Yet the effect of the amendment [enlarging the dates] was to obscure this difficulty and the amendment resulted in the jury being left to consider a Crown submission contradicted by the evidence of the complainant that what she was watching on the night of the offence was a replay of the royal wedding rather than a live telecast. It seems to me that the amendment resulted in unfairly depriving the appellant of the possibility of an acquittal which the indictment prior to amendment would have presented.”


	
	See also SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 and on referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal [2012] NSWCCA 205.
	
	
	Here, the complainant gave evidence that the offence occurred whilst the appellant was living in the same house with the family. There was no suggestion by her that it occurred after he had left. As it happened, the complainant also thought that it occurred after the renovation of the kitchen. The evidence of the complainant’s mother, which was preferred by the trial judge, was that the kitchen renovations were done after the appellant had moved out of the house. Although it is true that the appellant did not raise an alibi defence, in terms, it is clear as I have said that the case was fought upon the basis that he was still living at the home and was given to early rising. Once the mother’s evidence that the kitchen renovations occurred after the appellant had left the house was accepted, it followed that the complainant’s evidence that the offence had occurred whilst he was living at the house, dated not only by reference to the kitchen renovations of course but her own recollection of his departure could not be correct. The defence had established that it was not possible for the crime to have occurred, not only within the timeframe alleged by the indictment, but more importantly the period which was fixed by his residence in the family home. Had the defence been made aware that the case would change to an allegation that the offence had not occurred after the kitchen renovations but during them and that the appellant had left the home rather than still living there, it would have been possible to have adduced from the mother – and, perhaps, from other witnesses – what the arrangements were for his visits whilst the renovations were proceeding or afterwards and whether, indeed, he had access to the house whilst the mother was still abed. As a practical matter, the defence were denied this evidence because of the change in the case after the evidence had closed, indeed, after addresses. In short this was not the case that the appellant was informed he needed to meet and, in the circumstances, he was denied the opportunity of doing so.
	


Conclusion


	
	The grounds of appeal are not in any logical progression. For clarity, I propose to deal with them in general terms. Ground 1 submits that the trial judge erred in his Honour’s procedural approach. For the reasons explained above, I would reject this ground. There was no error in the order in which the judge dealt with the issues in the case, legal or factual. As to Ground 2(a), in my respectful view, the judge erred in expanding the indictment to comprehend an offence that allegedly occurred after the appellant had left the complainant’s family home. I further conclude that this resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Although the judge directed himself in accordance with s 165A of the Evidence Act 1995, and the warnings in Croft and Murray, his Honour’s scrutiny of the evidence involved several significant errors of fact. Furthermore, the judge’s omission of a consideration of the possibility of confabulation was, in substance, unexplained. For the reasons stated in Fleming, an explanation was necessary to comply with the requirements of s 165A. In the circumstances, the mere acceptance of the honesty of the complainant did not justify this conclusion. This was the error identified in Douglass.
	
	
	Ground 2 also sought under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the setting aside of the verdicts as unreasonable or unable to be supported having regard to the evidence. Although the form of the ground appeared to rely only on specified complaints, the Court was informed that it was intended, as the written submissions made clear, to rely on it as a stand alone ground. There was no objection from the Crown to this reading of the ground.
	
	
	Arun v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 214 contains a recent discussion by Hall J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) of the principles applying to an appeal against the verdict of a judge sitting alone under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act on this ground. After mentioning (at [52]) Keir v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 149, his Honour set out the following passage from the judgment of Wood CJ at CL (with whom the other judges agreed) in R v Moffatt (2000) 112 A Crim R 201 at [3] – [5] –
	


“The Court of Criminal Appeal is a court of error, and does not proceed by way of re-hearing in a way that permits it to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the jury, or of the trial Judge where acting alone: Kyriakou (1987) 29 A Crim R 50, and Kurtic, CCA (NSW) (26 February 1996, unreported).

Where, as in the present case, the relevant ground is that the verdict, or more accurately, the finding on the question of guilt by the trial Judge (s.17 Criminal Procedure Act 1986) should be set aside upon the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence (s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912), then it can only intervene if, after making its own independent assessment of the evidence, it concludes that it was not open for the trial judge to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant: MM (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493, and Jones (1997) 149 ALR 598. In that event, error permitting the substitution of a verdict of acquittal is established: Coombe, CCA (NSW) 24 April 1997 at p 11 and p 12.

What is required in this regard is attention to the matters identified in Fleming (1998) 158 ALR 379, Giam (1999) 104 A Crim R 416 and Gipp (1998) 194 CLR 102.” (Emphasis added).

Hall J then set out the provisions of s 6(1), referred to the importance of giving attention to the precise words of the subsection and continued –

“[54] …It was also noted in Keir (supra) that, with respect to the interaction of s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act and s.133 of the Criminal Procedure Act (then s.33 of that Act), the High Court said in the unanimous judgment at 262, [26] –

Thirdly, the first limb of s 6(1), which deals with the unsatisfactory quality of ‘the verdict of the jury’, must now be seen through the prism of s 33(1). The first limb will address attention to the evidence upon which the trial judge acted, or upon which it was open to the trial judge to act, in reaching the finding as to ultimate guilt. Approached on that footing, is that finding ‘unreasonable’ or one which ‘cannot be supported’?

…

[56] This Court is required to make its own independent assessment of the evidence. As noted in Keir (supra) at [20], in undertaking that task, the credibility findings of the trial judge with respect to the witnesses remain significant: Fleming (supra) at 266-267, [44]–[46].”


	
	Accepting the credibility findings of the trial judge, my independent assessment of the evidence is that it was not open for the trial judge to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant. Accepting that the complainant should be regarded as an honest witness, sincerely relating what she believed to be true, it seems to me that there is, at the least, a reasonable possibility that the true explanation for the matters to which I have adverted in respect of the circumstances of the alleged offence and its aftermath, including the place of residence of the appellant at the time and the denials of the complainant to her mother’s enquiries about whether the appellant had misconducted himself towards her, the lack of any supporting evidence of opportunity (accepting the mother’s evidence as to his departure), and the contradiction as to her attitude to the appellant – in light also of the complainant’s age at the time of the alleged offences and her age when she disclosed them – is that she has confabulated the alleged assault with some other, innocent, interaction.
	
	
	Accordingly I would, on this ground, allow the appeal and acquit the appellant.
	
	
	Even if I had not come to this conclusion, I would not order a new trial and, accordingly, would propose an order of acquittal. The essential reason for this conclusion is that the case that the alleged assault, if it occurred, took place before the appellant had left the complainant’s home, is most likely to fail in light of the mother’s evidence as to the date of the kitchen renovations and the appellant’s departure. I do not think that it would be appropriate, the Crown having undertaken a trial on the basis that the offence occurred whilst the appellant was living in the complainant’s home, should now be permitted to put the appellant to trial on a significantly different case. Furthermore, the appellant’s non-parole period expired on 12 January 2013 and the overall sentence expires on 11 January 2014, so that he has already served about 80% of his sentence.
	


Proposed orders

1. Leave to appeal be granted.

2. Appeal upheld, conviction on both counts quashed.

3. Verdicts of acquittal be entered.


	
	BEECH-JONES J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Adams J. His Honour’s judgment relieves me of the necessity to set out the background to the appeal. As is apparent from his Honour’s judgment, the applicant is the grandfather of the complainant. Neither party to the appeal sought an order suppressing the applicant’s identity. Presumably the Crown considered that such an order was not necessary to preserve the complainant’s anonymity.
	
	
	Before I address each of the grounds of the appeal it is necessary to outline the evidence and the trial judge’s findings concerning one matter that was said by the applicant to be of particular significance to whether the complainant’s evidence should have been accepted as reliable, namely the timing of the offence. The trial judge described this as “perhaps the most significant” respect in which her evidence differed from that of the other witnesses.
	
	
	The complainant was the first witness called at the trial. Her evidence in chief consisted of her stating that what she told the police in her interview was true. The video of the interview was played. She was then asked some further brief questions in chief before being cross-examined.
	
	
	In her interview with the police the complainant said the offence occurred when she was “7 or 8”, but that she could not remember the year. In both her interview and in cross-examination she stated that the offence occurred at a time when the applicant was living with her, her sister and mother at a house in Wagga. She stated that the applicant continued to live with them for “probably about a year or two” afterwards. The evidence of the applicant’s parole officer referred to in the judgment of Adams J (at [12]) established that he lived with the complainant, her sister and her mother from 22 July 2004 to sometime in June 2006. The complainant was born on 13 April 1999 and turned 7 on 13 April 2006.
	
	
	Another matter relevant to the time of the offence concerned the timing of renovations that were undertaken to the kitchen at the house in Wagga. In her interview the complainant was asked:
	


“Q79  …  So this time it happened when you were 7 or 8, can you think of anything that was happening around that time that, that might help you remember when it was?

A  Um, we just sold about five cats.

Q80  O.K. You just sold five cats.

A  Um, like, he’d just finished building the kitchen.

Q81  He had just finished, had he?

A  Yeah, he had built the kitchen, because it wasn’t really that big.”


	
	In cross examination she was asked:
	


“Q.  You told them [the police] that Pop touched you in the bedroom?

A.  Yep.

Q.  You told them that you remember that this was after Pop finished the kitchen?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Can you remember how long after it was that Pop finished the kitchen?

A.   No.

Q.   Do you think it might’ve been weeks after, or months after?

A.   I can’t remember that.

Q.   All right, but you definitely remember –

A.   It was after.

Q.   It was after?

A.   Yeah.”


	
	In his Honour’s judgment (at [17]), Adams J notes that the complainant’s evidence as to the timing of the kitchen renovations was given without qualification or any expression of uncertainty. I agree although I do not take the above answers as necessarily embracing the degree of certainty that the cross-examiner was seeking to obtain from her. Neither the reasons of the trial judge nor the submissions of any of the counsel who appeared at the trial before his Honour suggested that the complainant embraced the exactitude that was being urged upon her by the cross examiner.
	
	
	It should also be noted that neither the Crown Prosecutor nor counsel for the applicant ever suggested to the complainant that she was wrong or mistaken to the extent that her evidence suggested that the applicant renovated the kitchen while he was living at the house. Hence it is not known what her response would be to a suggestion that she was mistaken in recounting the timing of those events.
	
	
	The Crown led evidence from the complainant’s mother as to the timing of the renovation work to the kitchen undertaken by the applicant. Her evidence was less than emphatic as to the date:
	


“A.   Well he left in September 2006 so it would’ve been – he would’ve done the kitchen after.

Q.   After he left?

A.   Yeah.”

Her evidence in cross-examination was to similar effect.


	
	The Crown Prosecutor did not ask the complainant’s mother any question that could have justified a conclusion that the offence occurred after the time at which the applicant ceased living at the house in Wagga. It is to be recalled that the complainant stated that the offence involved the applicant calling her into his room. Her mother was not asked whether he maintained a room at the home after he ceased living there. The complainant said that the offence took place at “probably about 8 in the morning” when her mother was asleep. However her mother was not asked whether he ever arrived early in the morning prior to her waking. She was not asked whether he ever stayed over at the house in the period after he ceased living there.
	
	
	In his address the Crown Prosecutor explained that the dates in the indictment did not bind the Crown, and the relevant time frame for the offence was the period when the applicant lived with the complainant’s family at Wagga from mid-2004 to 2006. The Crown Prosecutor referred to the evidence concerning the timing of the renovations to the kitchen. He stated that he “wouldn’t cavil” with an acceptance of the complainant’s mother’s evidence that they were undertaken after the applicant left the residence, although he noted the “uncertainty” in her evidence that I have referred to above (at [106]). However the Crown submitted that any mistake as to the timing of the renovations was not critical. He submitted that the complainant was “quite clear” that the offence occurred “in the morning when he was living with them”. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that it could be expected that the complainant would remember the period when her grandfather lived with her (and inferentially it was less likely that she would have any strong recollection of when he undertook renovations to the kitchen).
	
	
	Thus the Crown confined its case to one that identified the offence as having occurred during the period the applicant lived with the complainant and her family in Wagga. It submitted that the complainant’s reference to the kitchen renovations occurring prior to the offence was a simple mistake concerning an irrelevant detail.
	
	
	His Honour did not adopt the Crown’s approach. In dealing with the relevance of the renovations his Honour concluded:
	


“A factor that has to be addressed is the fact that the complainant said that this event occurred at a time when the [applicant] had finished his work on the kitchen in the complainant’s home. The complainant’s mother said that the [applicant] completed this work after he stopped living at the house. The complainant’s evidence implied that he was still living there at the time. It is submitted that if the complainant’s mother is correct, then the event alleged by the complainant could not have happened. That overstates the situation.

I note that there was no independent evidence to confirm when the kitchen work was undertaken, even though the work was carried out through the auspices of a kitchen renovation company. Despite that, if I accept that the complainant’s mother’s evidence should be accepted – and on balance I do accept that – it is still possible that the complainant was simply wrong when she said that the [applicant] lived in the house at the time.

In a sense this makes her evidence unreliable but not in a way that significantly detracts from her disclosure. The question of when the kitchen was finished would not have been a prominent issue for the complainant when she related her complaint, which dates from some five years previously. She provided that information because she was asked for it by the police to attempt to give some timeframe for possible charges. In addition, there was no evidence that the [applicant]’s former bedroom was not still being used by him at times, especially when he was at the home working on the kitchen.

Importantly in my view the complainant said that the [applicant] was dressed in his blue jeans and a tank-top. It is not entirely impossible, but frankly extremely unlikely that the [applicant] went to bed in those clothes. I note that evidence of the manner in which he was dressed for bed could have been led from the grandmother who had been married to him, and his daughter who lived with him, but none was led.

What is most likely is that the [applicant] was already dressed for work at a time when the alleged event took place. If he was dressed for work and he was in [the complainant]’s home, then it is likely that he was there working on the kitchen.

As I understand it, the [applicant] ended up leaving the home around September 2006. A Probation and Parole officer gave evidence that the [applicant] sought permission to leave the house in June 2006. Whatever the actual date, it is possible in the circumstances that the allegation made by [the complainant] falls outside the dates in the indictment.

This is not a case where time is of the essence. The question is whether the event took place or not. The complainant has given the details that she is able to give to provide a date for the incident and there is more than sufficient detail for the [applicant] to be able to address the complaint.” (emphasis added)


	
	With respect to his Honour, this reasoning cannot be supported. In this passage his Honour accepts the complainant’s mother’s evidence as to the timing of the renovations. His Honour appeared to accept that the complainant could have been mistaken as to the timing of the renovations in that his Honour accepted that the timing of the renovation “would not have been a prominent issue” for her. Nevertheless, his Honour concluded that the offence occurred while he was working on the kitchen. This conclusion is flatly inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence which, in this respect, was that the offence occurred after the renovations. It is also inconsistent with the balance of the evidence at the trial which, in my view, was capable of demonstrating that the offence occurred before the renovations and that the complainant was simply mistaken as to the timing of the renovations. There was no evidence that the offence occurred during the renovations.
	
	
	The complainant’s description of the applicant as having worn jeans at the time of the offence was a wholly speculative basis for concluding that he was at the house working on the kitchen. Further, his Honour’s reference to there being “no evidence that the [applicant’s] former bedroom was not still being used by him” after he left the house misstates the correct position. There was no evidence that it was being used by him. In the context of the onus being upon the Crown to prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt, then, at the very least, it was incumbent upon the Crown to adduce such evidence if it wanted to support a finding that the offence occurred after the applicant ceased living with the complainant’s family at Wagga. It did not do so because the Crown eschewed any such case.
	
	
	The relevant finding of the trial judge was that it was “likely” that the offence occurred while the applicant was at the house in Wagga working on the kitchen some time after he ceased living there. In Fleming v R [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250 at [26] the High Court noted the following in relation to a challenge to particular factual findings made by a trial judge in a judge alone trial:
	


“Thirdly, the first limb of s6(1) [of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912], which deals with the unsatisfactory quality of ‘the verdict of the jury’, must now be seen through the prism of s33(1). The first limb will address attention to the evidence upon which the trial judge acted, or upon which it was open to the trial judge to act, in reaching the finding as to ultimate guilt. Approached on that footing, is that finding ‘unreasonable’ or one which ‘cannot be supported’? It is unnecessary on this appeal to determine whether, in such cases under the first limb or in cases under the more broadly stated third limb, the appellate court will intervene, as it was put in passages from decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal set out earlier in these reasons, only where there was no evidence to support a particular finding, the evidence was all the one way or there has been a misdirection, leading to a miscarriage of justice.” (References omitted)

The decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to in this passage were R v Kurtic (1996) 85 A Crim R 57 at 60, R v Ion (1996) 89 A Crim R 81 at 85 to 86, and R v O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397 at 401.


	
	It follows that, at the very least, a “particular finding” of a trial judge in a judge alone trial will attract appellate intervention under the third limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act if there is no evidence to support it. Whether it can be reviewed on a wider basis has not yet been settled. For the reasons I have outlined, there was no evidence to support the finding that it was “likely” that at the time the offence was committed the applicant was at the house working on the kitchen and had ceased living there. The consequence is that the trial judge’s reasoning supporting the guilty verdict cannot be supported. A matter pointed to by the applicant as potentially warranting a rejection of the complainant’s evidence was rejected by his Honour on the basis of a factual finding that had no evidentiary basis.
	
	
	It follows from this conclusion that I consider that the third limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act has been made out, namely that there was a miscarriage of justice. I will return to address what I consider should follow from this, but at present I also note that the case put by the Crown was not addressed either. As I have said, the Crown contended that the offence occurred during the period that the applicant lived with the complainant’s family at the house in Wagga, and that she was mistaken as to the timing of the kitchen renovations. In the first part of the above extract his Honour appears to have accepted the force of that latter contention but then departed from it by speculating that the offence occurred after the applicant ceased living at the house in Wagga.
	
	
	Against the above background I will address the individual grounds of appeal.
	


Ground 1(a) – Murray direction


	
	Ground 1(a) is set out in the judgment of Adams J at [8] and the relevant statement of principle from Murray v R [2002] HCA 26; 189 ALR 40 is set out at [11]. I agree with his Honour that this ground should be rejected. The only matter pointed to by the applicant as supporting this ground is the fact that in his judgment his Honour recorded his impression that the complainant was a “believable witness who was doing her best to tell the truth about something that had actually happened in her life” at a point prior to setting out, inter alia, the terms of the Murray direction.
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions concerning this ground appear to falsely assume that the “judgment” prepared by a judge sitting without a jury and referred to in s 133(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 is a record of the trial judge’s deliberations, commencing on the first page with the judge having an open mind, and only concluding with the trial judge reaching a verdict on the last page. In fact, the judgment is the trial judge’s explanation for the verdict that they have reached usually prior to publishing the judgment. The location within the judgment of an observation recording the application of a direction is not a necessary indicator that it was not applied to the evidence and matters discussed in that part of the judgment that precedes it.
	
	
	Ground 1(a) appears to raise a question of law and thus does not require leave (Criminal Appeal Act, s 5(1)(a)). I reject ground 1(a).
	


Ground 1(b) – Reversal of Onus of Proof


	
	The terms of this ground are set out in the judgment of Adams J at [8]. This ground was directed towards the reasoning of the trial judge that I have extracted above at [110]. Two particular complaints were made.
	
	
	First, reference was made to that part of the extract in which his Honour noted that “[t]he question of when the kitchen was finished would not have been a prominent issue for [the complainant] when she related her complaint, which dates from some five years previously”. This reasoning was said by the applicant to have involved “making an allowance … of the type which was criticised by the High Court in Douglass v R [2012] HCA 34; 290 ALR 699 at [43] and [45]”. This assertion was not elaborated upon.
	
	
	In Douglass the High Court found that the trial judge in that case had accepted the truthfulness of the complainant’s evidence, but had not addressed the “distinct question of [its] reliability” (at [15]). The complainant in Douglass was just under four years old at the time of the alleged offence, and five years and nine months of age at the time of the trial (at [2]). In the passages cited by the applicant from Douglass, the High Court found, contrary to the trial judge in that case, that the initial denials by the complainant of the offence and the inconsistencies in her evidence suggested that her evidence was unreliable and were not matters that were addressed by her “firmness in cross examination”, which was (only) capable of “bearing on her truthfulness” (at [45]).
	
	
	Nothing in these passages from Douglass support the applicant’s contention that it was not open to his Honour in this case to reason that the timing of the renovations undertaken on the house was a matter that the complainant might be expected to be mistaken about, and that the complainant’s mistaken recollection of that matter was not necessarily fatal to the reliability of her evidence. In any event, as I have explained, ultimately his Honour did not develop that reasoning and find that the offence occurred while the applicant lived with the complainant, as was urged by the Crown.
	
	
	Second, the applicant complains that his Honour reversed the onus of proof in that part of the extract in [110] in which his Honour noted that “there was no evidence that the [applicant]’s former bedroom was not still being used by him at times [after he ceased living with the family], especially when he was at home working on the kitchen”. I have already addressed this at [112]. Depending on its context, such a comment may not demonstrate error. However, I have already accepted that it is confirmatory of a finding as to the timing of the offence that had no evidentiary basis. In that sense I accept ground 1(b) (and would grant leave to raise it to the extent that may be required).
	


Ground 2 – Unreasonable finding of guilt and other matters


	
	The terms of ground 2 are extracted in the judgment of Adams J (at [8]). The opening words of the ground invoke the first limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The first limb requires that attention be directed to the evidence upon which the trial judge acted or upon which it was open to the trial judge to act (Fleming at [26]). The only relevance of the trial judge’s reasons for judgment to that aspect of ground 2 is that they may expressly or implicitly record the advantages enjoyed by the trial judge, which in turn may inform the limitations imposed on this Court on forming a conclusion as to whether ""upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the [applicant] was guilty"" (M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493).
	
	
	The matters alleged in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) of ground 2 all address allegedly erroneous aspects of the trial judge’s judgment. They only raise matters that possibly fall within the second and, most likely, the third limb of s 6(1). I will address those grounds first.
	


Ground 2(a) – Time of the essence


	
	Ground 2(a) contends that the trial judge erred when he found that time was not of the essence in relation to the dates of the indictment. I have described the approach taken by the Crown to the timing of the offence at [108] to [109]. As I have explained, his Honour ultimately found that the offence occurred at a time after that identified by the Crown which was fixed upon the time the applicant lived with the complainant and her family.
	
	
	At [85] Adams J has set out the relevant statement of principle from the judgment of Gleeson CJ in R v VHP (Court of Criminal Appeal, Gleeson CJ, Handley ja and Studdert J, 7 July 1997, unreported) in which his Honour identified two possible qualifications to the proposition that the Crown need not prove some generally inessential fact or particular, such as the date of the offence in a case such as this. The first exception was where the requirements of procedural fairness restricted the capacity of the Crown to depart from such particulars. In this case the Crown confined itself to a case alleging that the offence took place when the applicant resided with the complainant, her mother and sister. It adduced evidence directed to that time frame and did not lead evidence to lay an evidentiary foundation for the trial judge’s finding as to the date of the offence. However the exchange between the trial judge and counsel noted in the judgment of Adams J at [51] and [84] may have been sufficient to place the applicant on notice that a potentially wider period could be considered. In the end result it is not necessary to determine this.
	
	
	The second exception identified by Gleeson CJ in R v VHP was that the “evidence … may be such that it would not be open to a jury, acting reasonably, to treat one part of the Crown case as reliable, and another part as unreliable”. This invites attention as to whether the trier of fact acting reasonably could have accepted the complainant’s evidence that the assault occurred, but rejected her evidence that it occurred while the applicant was residing with her family. For the reasons that I have already outlined, I do not accept that his Honour could have done so. There was simply no evidentiary foundation for finding that the offence occurred at a later time. The evidence only permitted a conclusion that, if the offence was committed, it was during the period the applicant resided with the complainant and her family.
	
	
	It follows that I accept ground 2(a) is made out and would grant leave to raise it to the extent that leave may be required.
	


Grounds 2(b) to 2(d): Directions and reliability of the complainant’s evidence


	
	Ground 2(b) is set out in the judgment of Adams J at [8]. As framed, it appears to raise an issue as to whether the trial judge was required to give a direction of the kind contemplated by s 165A(2) of the Evidence Act 1995. A number of potentially significant issues would need to be resolved in order to establish a ground framed in those terms. One issue is whether an obligation on a trial judge to give such a direction is established by meeting the criteria in s 165A(2); ie “satisfaction” that “there are circumstances (other than solely the age of the child) particular to the child that affect the reliability of the child’s evidence and that warrant the giving of a warning or the information”. If that is correct and the trial judge fails to give a direction, what standard of review is to be applied to the failure to be so satisfied? Another issue was raised by the Crown in that it submitted that ss 165 and 165A of the Evidence Act are solely concerned with trials before a jury and have no application to a judge alone trial.
	
	
	It is not necessary to address these issues because, as the submissions were developed, it became clear that the applicant’s true complaint under this ground was that the trial judge had not assessed the “reliability” of the complainant’s evidence and had only assessed her honesty as a witness. Leaving aside s 165A(2), in my view it is clear from Douglass that such an assessment was required.
	
	
	Whether or not the trial judge addressed the reliability of the complainant’s evidence is a matter that has caused me considerable hesitation. Throughout his Honour’s judgment he addressed all the various matters that were put to him as warranting the rejection of the complainant’s evidence, either because they showed she was not honest, or was otherwise unreliable. However I agree with Adams J (at [80]) that his Honour only addressed the former and not the latter. In my view this is made clear by the following passage from his Honour’s judgment:
	


“There is no dispute that the complainant was asked on a number of occasions by the complainant’s mother whether the [applicant] had touched her and she understood that meant sexually and she had denied that touching. A principal submission for the [applicant] is that those denials should at least cause the Court to have a significant doubt about the veracity of the complainant’s account.

It was submitted that perhaps there is a question of the reliability of the complainant’s evidence, but I do not accept that in reality the issues here can be addressed in that way. There is no question that the complainant has related what she said was a memory of an incident. The reality is that the event either happened or it did not. She has not made a significant mistake about that event.” (emphasis added)


	
	With respect to his Honour it may be true that the event “either happened or it did not”, but it is not true that the complainant was either lying about the event or giving honest evidence. Between those two possibilities there are various permutations which include that when she gave evidence the complainant genuinely believed that the event occurred but it had not. As Douglass makes clear these issues are dealt with under the rubric of “reliability”. The complainant’s denials had the potential to lead to an adverse conclusion about the reliability of her evidence. His Honour erred in asserting to the contrary.
	
	
	Ground 2(c) is set out in the judgment of Adams J at [8]. With this ground the applicant accepted that the trial judge gave himself a Croft direction about the effect of delay, but complains that his Honour did not properly apply the direction in that his Honour failed to consider its effect upon the reliability of the complainant’s evidence. Ground 2(d) makes the same complaint in relation to the trial judge’s approach to the application of a Murray direction. As with ground 2(b), the real complaint with both of these grounds was the alleged failure of the trial judge to assess the reliability of the complainant’s evidence. It follows from the above that I would grant leave to the applicant to raise these grounds and consider that they are made out. I adopt the same view in relation to ground 2(b). If it is not clear already, I repeat that my reasons for doing so do not turn upon any obligation said to be imposed on the trial judge by s 165A of the Evidence Act.
	


Balance of Ground 2: unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence


	
	I have reviewed the evidence given at the trial, including that of the complainant, although I have not viewed the video of her interview that was tendered as her evidence in chief (see SKA v R; R v SKA [2009] NSWCCA 186 at [106] to [108] per Simpson J (McClellan CJ at CL and James J agreeing); SKA v R at [28] per French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ; R v NZ [2005] NSWCCA 278 at [10] to [11] per Spigelman CJ). The trial judge found her to be an honest witness. Her evidence was not inherently unlikely or incredible. As I have explained above, one difficulty with the complainant’s evidence is that she nominated the offence as having occurred at a time when the applicant lived with her and her family, but after the work on the kitchen was complete, and when other evidence suggested that the work on the kitchen occurred after he ceased living with them. For the reasons I have already discussed, I regard it as open to a trier of fact acting reasonably to regard any mistake by her as to the timing of the kitchen renovation work as of little or no significance. As I have stated, it was never suggested to her that she was mistaken about the timing of that work. The evidence as to her reasons for not complaining earlier also had some confusing aspects to it in terms of the time at which she learnt unsavoury details of the applicant’s past conduct or at least rumours about those matters. However, given her description of the offence and that the applicant is said to have told her to not tell her mother her stated reason for subsequently denying the incident, namely that she was scared, was entirely plausible.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that it was “not open for the trial judge to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant”: M v R at 493. I would grant the applicant leave to raise the balance of ground 2, but reject it.
	
	
	Nevertheless the question arises whether the Court should enter a verdict of acquittal pursuant to s 6(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 or direct that there be a new trial pursuant to s 8(1). In his judgment (at [97]) Adams J concludes that, even if the verdict was unreasonable, his Honour would nevertheless order an acquittal. This is so because his Honour considers that the Crown’s case at the trial would most likely fail and the Crown should not be permitted to run a different case. It follows from the above that I do not accept that the case run by the Crown would most likely fail. I also consider there is no question of the Crown running a new case at trial. Instead it appears to me that the Crown case was never dealt with on its merits. However, as Adams J points out, the applicant has now served the entirety of his non parole period and a substantial part of the balance of term. In those circumstances I consider that the interests of justice do not require that there be a new trial (Jiminez v The Queen [1992] HCA 14; (1992) 173 CLR 572 at 590 per McHugh J; The Queen v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; (2007) 228 CLR 232 at [55] per Kirby J and see Haoui v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 209 at [164] to [166] per Johnson J).
	
	
	Accordingly I agree with the orders proposed by Adams J.

		24 June 2015",2013-05-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761447,"R v Lim, R v Tan [2013] NSWDC 327","SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: I propose to impose identical sentences on both prisoners, taking into account the objective and subjective circumstances for reasons I will explain shortly. The total sentence I will impose is fourteen years imprisonment with a non-parole period of ten years. The effective non-parole period of ten years, I obviously have adjusted the non-parole period to reflect two special circumstances, the first special circumstance being the accumulation of sentences, the second special circumstance that may invoke the discretion under s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, being a slightly extended period of time to adjust to community living and receive appropriate direction from the Parole Service. I am appreciative, of course, of the fact the prisoners will be deported but as is well known, that does not relieve the Court of the necessity to consider relevant special circumstances and make the necessary adjustment. I have given the prisoners each a discount of twenty-five per cent to recognise the benefit of the utilitarian value of their pleas of guilty. 

2In relation to the first supply heroin charge, I will impose a sentence of seven-and-a-half years imprisonment which will date from the date that they came into custody. I will fix a non-parole period in relation to that sentence of five years, as I am required to under the legislation to fix a non-parole period for a sentence where there is a standard non-parole period provided. 

3In relation to the two offences of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, these are respectively committed on 28 July and 3 August, I propose to impose sentences of nine years imprisonment each to be concurrent one with the other but to start eighteen months into the sentence for the first matter, that is, to start on 9 February 2013. I propose to fix a non-parole period in relation to that sentence of six years.

4In relation to the last offence in time, the supply of a large commercial quantity of heroin, I propose to fix a sentence of ten years six months, that sentence commencing from 9 February 2015 that is, two years after the commencement of the sentence before, and I fix a non-parole period for that sentence of six-and-a-half years so the ultimate total sentence will be fourteen years with a non-parole period of ten years. I will give my reasons for arriving at that calculation.

5The prisoners appearing today for sentence are Cheng Choy Lim, who was born as I understand on 17 May 1963, and Yong Hong Tan who as I understand it was born on 24 June 1983. Hereinafter, I will refer to the two prisoners as Mr Lim and Mr Tan. They appear today for sentence in relation to identical charges. The first offence in time is a charge alleging that each of them on 28 July 2011, at Haymarket in the State of New South Wales, did supply a prohibited drug namely, 685.3 grams of heroin being an amount which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug. This is an offence contrary to s 25 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of ten years imprisonment. The second offence in time is an allegation against each of them that they, on 28 July 2011 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug namely, 998 grams of methylamphetamine, being an amount which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug. That offence, contrary to the same provision of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, has the same maximum penalty as the previous offence. 

6The third offence in time is an offence of supplying at Sydney on 3 August 2011, a prohibited drug not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug to wit, 996.5 grams of methylamphetamine. The last offence in time is an offence alleging that each of the accused on 7 August 2011 at Lansvale in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug namely, 1,381 grams of heroin being an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that drug. That offence, as opposed to the previous offences carries, under the relevant provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and/or a fine of 5,000 penalty units and a standard non-parole period of fifteen years imprisonment. I should point out of course that the offence of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of a particular prohibited drug has an additional or alternative penalty of 3,500 penalty units. 

7In respect of the first offence in time, as I have referred to it and will hereinafter refer to as the first offence, there was a person who could be called a co-accused called Xiao Ding who I will hereinafter refer to as Ding, who was sentenced on 10 August 2012 by her Honour Judge Murrell. I have read her Honour's remarks on sentence. In relation to the second and third offences in time there was a co-accused called Cheung Wing Chow, who was sentenced on 3 August 2012 by his Honour Judge Neilson of this Court. I have read the remarks on sentence in relation to those matters. In relation to the fourth offence in time, the co-accused, or person involved in the criminal enterprise to a particular extent was Fook Chan Wong who was sentenced on 24 April 2013 by his Honour Judge Haesler. As with the other remarks on sentence I have read those remarks on sentence and I will refer to some aspects of those sentencing exercises as they are obviously highly relevant to the sentencing of these two prisoners. 

8Although the four offences are particularised as being committed by the prisoners between 28 July and 7 August 2009, the evidence reveals to the Court, through the very lengthy statement of facts tendered by the Crown, that preparations and arrangements that culminated on the commission of the offences with which I am concerned began in February 2011 arising out of a joint investigation focussing on large scale domestic supply of prohibited drugs particularly methylamphetamine and heroin in New South Wales. The investigating authorities were assisted by a person described as a ""civilian police source"" who is named in the 'facts' as ""Jimmy."" It would appear that he and Mr Tan had some association prior to February 2011 for some few years beforehand, the detail of which is irrelevant at this particular time. 

9From late February 2011 up until the arrest of the prisoners there was an active police telephone intercept operation that occurred intercepting various telephone calls but initially, telephone calls between Jimmy and Mr Tan. These telephone calls commencing in February 2011, so far as the investigations were concerned related to discussions between Jimmy and Mr Tan concerning the prospective future supply to Jimmy of prohibited drugs. The relationship between Jimmy and Tan culminated, as I will outline in the later facts, in Mr Tan with his wife arriving in Australia from Malaysia on 29 July 2011 to be ensconced at the supposed expense of Jimmy, but under the close surveillance of the investigating authorities at the Star City Casino. Mr Lim as I understand it arrived in Australia on 2 August 2011 staying at the same facility. There was, as the particulars reveal, a supply to which both prisoners have pleaded guilty when both prisoners were outside the country. The facts clearly establish the basis upon which that charge was properly brought. There was, in fact, two supplies prior to Mr Lim's arrival and two supplies, to which the prisoners have pleaded guilty, after his arrival. 

10During the course of the initial detailed conversation set out in the facts on 25 February 2011 Mr Tan sought to organise what was described as a ""long term arrangement"" with Jimmy for the supply of prohibited drugs in Australia and for the next months Jimmy, and then Jimmy's supposed boss, ""David,"" another civilian police source, cultivated the accused Tan to come to Australia. I do not propose to dwell upon the considerable detail in the facts about those conversations. I refer to some features of them without necessarily indicating that overdue emphasis is being placed upon them. During the course of these various conversations that are referred to in the facts before Mr Tan's arrival in Australia, he referred to a boss or his boss as a man named, ""Peter"" and, up until July 2011, at various times gave details of his boss' supposed movements around Asia and the Middle East up until that time. Some of those details he provided are supported by the extracts of the prisoner Lim's passports which have been tendered, some are not. 

11The first time, as I understand it, Mr Lim spoke to Jimmy was when he became involved in a conversation that was intercepted, of course, occurring between Jimmy and Tan and Mr Tan passed the phone to him. In the various conversations that are cited in the facts, Mr Tan made representations about his responsibility to Lim as his boss, but also showed Mr Tan making arrangements for himself or in his interests to the exclusion of Mr Lim such as on one occasion talking Jimmy not to mention to Mr Lim a commission that Jimmy had been asked by Tan to include in the price. Tan also asked Jimmy without the assistance of Mr Lim at one point close to his arrival in Australia for $10,000 to cover expenses. 

12By 20 July, Tan had details of a man that he referred to Ah Hing otherwise known as Mr Ding, to provide to Jimmy and arrangements were made for the provision of heroin as a ""sample."" Heroin was referred to as ""the girl"" or ""girls"" in the course of some of these conversations. In relation to the first supply which involved Mr Ding, there was an agreement between Tan and Jimmy that the cost of the supply to Jimmy would be $150,000 and that ultimately, when the transfer of the drugs occurred, Mr Ding was to be paid $5,000 in cash. It was during a conversation on 22 July that Jimmy explained that he was a ""middle man"" and that his boss was named, ""David,"" to whom I earlier referred, and David became more involved in the various arrangements and there were many that occurred in subsequent days up until the arrest of the two accused. 

13By 25 July 2011 Mr Tan had arranged to arrive in Australia on 29 July, he supplied Jimmy with information as to the cost of his flights and cast upon Jimmy, as I earlier mentioned, the obligation of arranging accommodation for himself and then Lim. On 26 July 2011 Tan also drew to Jimmy's attention the identity of the person Chow to whom I will refer shortly. So far as the first offence in time is concerned, on 28 July 2011 Mr Ding came up from Melbourne to Sydney to supply the drug to Jimmy. Tan on this day spoke to Jimmy and made arrangements for either him or David to meet with Ding. Ultimately, David met Ding at a McDonalds restaurant in Chinatown sometime around about 3.40 pm. David gave Ding an empty blue bag, Ding apparently went back to a hotel nearby and returned approximately a half an hour later and gave David back the bag that had been provided to him and inside it were contained one resealable bag with 335.6 grams of heroin with a purity of 72 per cent, one resealable bag containing 349.4 grams of heroin with a purity of 72.5 per cent and another resealable bag with a small quantity of heroin with a drug purity of 72.5 per cent. The total quantity of heroin that had been handed back to David by Ding, as I earlier mentioned, was 685.3 grams. Ding then travelled back to Canberra by bus. Unbeknownst to him, and Tan and Mr Lim, they were under constant police surveillance. Ding in fact was spoken to by police under the guise of a police operation taking the details of all the passengers on the bus that Ding was travelling in on his way back to Melbourne. Ultimately, Ding was arrested on 9 August. His arrest was delayed so as not to sabotage or prejudice the operation designed to ensnare Mr Lim and Mr Tan. There was contact between Jimmy and Mr Tan after the supply and reference made to ""the stuff"" being ""all right to eat."" 

14The second supply of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine came later the same day. This involved the man Mr Chow. He met Jimmy and David that evening near Sydney Town Hall and after some confusion as to whether Chow was to be paid money for the drugs that he was to hand over which involved Jimmy checking with Tan as to what the arrangements would be, David gave Chow a bag which Chow took to a residential complex in Bathurst Street. He returned with that bag, which had inside of it another container with 998 grams of methylamphetamine, which was found to have an average purity of 78 per cent. Chow again was not arrested at that time so as not to compromise the operation. Chow at that point was not paid any money by arrangement between Jimmy and Tan. 

15Mr Tan as I said earlier arrived in Sydney on 29 July 2011 with his wife. The room that he was installed in at the Star City Casino had various surveillance devices installed. The facts reveal in considerable detail that in the meetings between David, Jimmy, Tan and on some occasions, the wife and various conversations cited, although I am sure that the transcripts of those conversations run for far longer than the lengthy statement of facts. During one of these conversations Mr Tan agreed to supply 10 kilograms of methylamphetamine and at least four 350 gram lots of heroin on credit. At this stage, the outstanding debt for the heroin and the methylamphetamine which had been supplied the previous day was $305,000. Later coded conversations reveal that heroin was referred to as ""number one"" and methylamphetamine or ""ice"" was referred to as ""number two"" to reflect the order of supplies by Ding and Chow respectively. The facts reveal that Mr Chow was acting on behalf of principals in Hong Kong who apparently, as I would understand it, were the providers of the methylamphetamine that had been imported into Australia for Chow to supply to David and/or Jimmy. In relation to Chow's transactions, it is clear that Lim and Tan at least presented themselves to be, and this is the only evidence, as effectively brokers or intermediaries between the suppliers from Asia, located at least in Hong Kong, to the recipients in Sydney. It is clear on the evidence available to the Court that Mr Tan had knowledge of the source of the methylamphetamine and clearly was able to make all necessary arrangements for the connection to be made between Chow and Jimmy and as he was able to make a connection between Ding and David as the facts reveal.

16During the course of these various conversations Tan had with Jimmy and or David discussions were made about future supplies of ice sitting a minimum price of $160,000 per kilogram. During a meeting between Tan and David in the hotel room Tan received $10,000 in cash as part payment for the methylamphetamine previously supplied by Chow. Also, during one or other of these meetings, Tan told David about 500 kilograms of methylamphetamine to arrive in Australia. There was also a discussion about matters concerning interception of other drug importers in New Zealand, reflecting knowledge on the part of Tan of matters pertinent to the importation of drugs to Australasia. As I have pointed out, there were a number of meetings between Tan and David and or Jimmy between his arrival on 29 August and before Lim arrived. There were meetings where bank account details were provided by Tan to David for payment of money. But, ultimately, no agreement was made about the future supply of 10 kilograms of methylamphetamine until such time as full payment was made in respect of supplies already planned or completed. I assume this is the reason that at least Mr Tan has not been charged with an offence of offering to supply that quantity of methylamphetamine, given the extended definition of supply in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. 

17On 1 August 2011 David paid Tan $150,000 in what is described as 'police money' to settle the outstanding debt in relation to the methylamphetamine that Chow had earlier provided. Lim subsequently arrived on 2 August 2011, David met Tan and Lim in Lim's room, which itself was fitted with listening devices, at the Star City Casino. During the early meeting with David, Lim discussed value of drugs and made reference to the fact that he and his colleague Mr Tan would gain only $10,000 from the supply of one kilogram of what I understand to be methylamphetamine. Lim canvassed the possibility with David of him being supplied ecstasy in various ways but David was not interested in these suggestions. There were other discussions about the method in which drugs may be supplied in the future. 

18Later that day, Lim and Tan meeting with David discussed supply of a further amount of methylamphetamine on one week's credit with an agreed price if $160,000. It was expected that this supply would be about one kilogram. I should point out, going back to the first supply of heroin, that references were made in discussions between Tan and Jimmy and/or David, of that being a ""sample"" as references had been made to the supply of methylamphetamine initially as a ""sample"" for potential future supply. Further, bank account details of bank accounts apparently overseas were provided to David for him to make payment. 

19Amongst other things, at the conclusion of this meeting it was understood by David that he would meet Chow the next morning that is, on 3 August to be supplied with methylamphetamine. It thus came to pass that the third offence was committed when on Wednesday 3 August 2011. At about 11am David met Chow again in the vicinity of the Sydney Town Hall and again Chow went to the address at Bathurst Street, returned with a gift bag, gave it to David and some discussion occurred between them about a kilogram being available. There was reference to ""one girl"" to keep him occupied ""for starters."" During this transaction confirmation was made between David and Tan that the supply had taken place, the methylamphetamine that was supplied to David was found later to weigh 996.5 grams with a purity of 78 per cent. 

20There was subsequent contact between David and Tan and Lim and there were various arrangements made between them which ultimately led to information being provided by Tan that he understood there would be a supply or shipment of drugs, as it turned out heroin, that would arrive in Australia on 8 August or thereabouts. There were further discussions between the parties about further supplies and payment for the drugs supplied. By 4 August the debt owed, as I understand it, totalled $325,000, $145,000 for the heroin supplied on 28 July and $180,000 for the supply of methylamphetamine on 3 August 2011. Also, during this period of time, an unknown male was intercepted on one of the telephone services the subject of surveillance contacting Jimmy looking for Tan and providing a number in Malaysia for Tan to ring.

21The final supply occurred on 7 August 2011. The background to this was that on 5 August 2011 Lim was informed from an overseas source that a shipment would be arriving in Australia that would eventually be at the Stamford Hotel in Sydney and that the drugs had to be picked up by a particular time. In the early hours of 6 August 2011 Mr Lim and another unknown male in Malaysia coordinated timings for the delivery of the shipment. At 10am after various discussions had taken place Lim was given the location and the address for delivery. Later on Mr Tan contacted Mr Wong about picking up the drugs from the Stamford Hotel and at the Stamford Hotel, Mr Wong picked up two 700 gram, in general terms, units of heroin referred to as ""girls"" or a ""pair of girls"" with a confirmed price later reached of $150,000 for each of the approximately 700 gram units of heroin. Tan made arrangements for the supply to be given to or provided to David. 

22I just point out in passing, if it was not expressly stated in the facts provided to me, that my reading of the sentencing of Mr Wong revealed that Mr Wong was in fact the uncle of Mr Tan and Mr Wong was sentenced on the basis that Mr Tan had recruited him. Ultimately, there was the supply of 1.381 kilograms of heroin on the morning of 7 August which involved liaison with Wong for him to supply David at a McDonalds restaurant on the Hume Highway at Lansvale. These arrangements were largely made by Mr Tan. David told Tan he was going to use the same blue bag as he had used previously and the persons David and Mr Wong met each other in the car park, David saw a package in a Stamford Hotel bag, he placed the drugs in a blue bag that he was carrying, and when it was finally examined, the weight of the drugs was, as I pointed out, the drugs were heroin. The drugs had an average purity of 74 per cent. David then rang Lim to report that he had received the sample and ultimately, Mr Lim contacted Malaysia and requested persons in Malaysia to despatch another two females. Some reference was made to a missing sample of ice that it had been discussed to be supplied to David but as I understood the facts, Mr Lim was told by his Malaysian source that that ice was not for David. 

23Of course, by this stage, a great deal of money was outstanding to Tan and Lim for the drugs supplied. On 9 August 2011 David promised to settle the debt that afternoon and various discussions occurred about depositing monies in nominated bank accounts. The outstanding debt at this point was $625,000 and both Tan and Lim were becoming quite concerned at the slow efforts of David to pay what was owed. Lim was receiving pressure from Malaysia over this sum and the pressure upon Mr Tan was reflected in intercepted telephone conversations of this period which in part are before me in transcript form. 

24When it was learned by investigators that Mr Lim was intending to fly to Queensland, he was arrested at Kingsford-Smith Airport. When provided legal advice, he declined to be interviewed and has provided no coherent, or in any way believable, account of his involvement in the crimes with which he is concerned. Tan, Chow and Wong were likewise arrested on 9 August in a coordinated exercise and Mr Ding was arrested in Melbourne still in possession of the $5,000 given to him on 25 July. The facts state that between 3 August and 9 August whilst in Australia Mr Lim utilised a mobile phone service provided to him by David, hence the capacity of the authorities to intercept the telephone conversations. During this period of time the facts state that the prisoner Lim spoke to people in Malaysia, China, Indonesia and Dubai. These conversations consisted of receiving details of bank accounts, details of monies to be deposited into them and arrangements in relation to drug distribution. 

25Of course, the arrest of Mr Lim and Mr Tan brought an end to any potential supplies of either methylamphetamine or heroin. If not intercepted by arrest, the full extent of supplies that would have occurred, that would have been coordinated by one or other of them in what could fairly be described as a joint criminal enterprise, would merely be a matter of speculation. Clearly, however, they indicated their willingness and capacity to broker at the very least the supply of substantial quantities of methylamphetamine and heroin if available beyond those quantities already supplied. Both prisoners through the facts and the detail of their conversations with Jimmy and David indicated their knowledge at least for the source of the drugs, the timing of importation and the contacts of those that directly imported the drugs to facilitate supply.

26With regard to the co-accused, Mr Ding, he was sentenced on 10 August 2012 for supplying a commercial quantity of heroin, the same quantity as reflected in the first charge in time against each of the accused. He received a discount of twenty-five per cent upon the otherwise appropriate sentence and ultimately sentenced to a total of five years eight months imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and ten months. I calculate a starting point of the sentence imposed by her Honour to be eight-and-a-half years imprisonment. Mr Ding was twenty-four years of age, he had come to Australia as a student, he had not come to Australia to commit the crimes with which or the crime with which I am concerned in relation to these two accused. Her Honour obviously made a finding of special circumstances and it is clear from the concessions made and the submissions and the facts that he was beholden particularly to Mr Tan as Mr Tan was the person who had direct contact with him to facilitate the supply.

27Mr Chow was sentenced on 3 August 2012 to a total sentence of six years nine months for each offence with a non-parole period of four years in respect of each offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, however the sentence for one offence was partially accumulated upon the other offence to the extent of one year. Thus, I would understand the sentence imposed to be in effect seven years nine months with a non-parole period of five years. In relation to Mr Chow he was either at the time of the offence, or at the time of sentence, thirty-nine years of age. He had been in Australia for some period of time before the supply, he was a Chinese citizen. The judge found, as I find from the facts available to me, that he was employed by interests in Hong Kong. He like Mr Ding had no prior criminal convictions in Australia although at the age of twenty-one he had apparently been convicted of assault in Hong Kong, a matter about which his Honour gave little weight. He received a twenty-five per cent discount upon the otherwise appropriate sentence and my understanding would be that the starting point of the sentence imposed upon him was nine years imprisonment.

28Mr Wong pleaded guilty to supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of heroin, an identical charge to the charge that I have described as the fourth in time. He was sentenced by his Honour, Judge Haesler to a sentence of eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years. His Honour said in his remarks on sentence that the starting point of the sentence he imposed was nine years, I was told that the discount was ten per cent. My mathematics reveal that the discount must have been slightly greater than ten per cent. In any event, the learned sentencing judge indicated the starting point. Mr Wong was thirty-eight years of age, he, ""attempted to deceive police,"" to quote the findings of his Honour on sentence, he was related to Mr Tan and recruited by him to participate in this offence. Wong Hung Tan was referred to as ""his nephew"" in the remarks on sentence of the earned sentencing judge.

29Those sentences of course are very relevant in this sentencing exercise, not as comparative sentences per se, in the conventional sense, but as relevant in the assessment of parity issues so far as they apply in circumstances where the objective criminality was conceded by counsel for each of the accused in these matters to be greater, to varying degrees, to the objective criminality of those charged with identical offences. 

30Dealing with the cases by each of the accused and dealing first with the case conducted by Mr Lim, a report was tendered from a psychologist Daniel Hopkins which was prepared on 31 January 2013. This sets out the background of the prisoner given by him, a version which is untested as with his version of his involvement in the commission of the offences with which I am concerned. He said he was one of six children, born in Malaysia and had lived there, ""throughout his life"" before his arrest in Australia. He apparently came from a comfortable family, his father owned a transport business which the prisoner worked in for a period of time. He claimed no issues of physical and sexual abuse, he was involved in business ventures with friends or a friend, that left him out of pocket, one friend absconding with approximately USD100,000 which left him in financial difficulty. The prisoner's father's business went into receivership according to the prisoner in 2005. He went into a car sales business and share market training for a period of time and then in 2008 he said he attempted to set up a health food business venture and also developed a business that sold vehicle parts. He stated that these businesses failed as he was unable to find markets. He tried to develop new markets to sell products through advertising but this further increased his debt and the failed business ventures in combination left him with over AUD250,000 in debt. 

31This history that he has given of his business affairs does not sit at all squarely with what appears in his passport to be his movements in and out of Malaysia between 2006 and his arrival in Australia in 2011. As was noted in the course of the submissions, his passport reflects residency in the United Arab Emirates for a period of three years. Nothing is referred to in the history given the psychologist, or by his wife, to explain the reasons for him having residency in the UAE. Neither is any information provided by his wife, or him, to explain the detail of his travel as it appears in the passport. It goes without saying, in the context of him not giving evidence in these proceedings, that his version of his involvement in the commission of this offence given to the psychologist I cannot accept as truthful. Firstly, it is untested and many aspects of it sits at odds with the facts revealed to this Court, particularly the details that emerged from conversations had by Lim and Tan with Jimmy and David and the contacts the prisoner had with interests overseas in the supplies that were occurring in Australia, or were planned to occur in Australia during the brief time he was here. 

32I appreciate, just passing to another matter for a moment, that Mr Tan made many what could be called contemporaneous representations about the prisoner and his movements which are at odds with the version the prisoner has given in his psychological report. Of course, I appreciate that Mr Tan is, as learned counsel for Mr Lim pointed out, knowingly concerned with the same criminal enterprise as that with which Mr Tan is charged. I appreciate Mr Tan's contemporaneous representations are ""hearsay"" and are untested. If it was a matter of conducting a criminal trial, I doubt that there would be any issue that Mr Tan's representations to Jimmy and/or David would be admissible, subject of course to the s 137 discretion, to establish the relationship between Tan and Mr Lim. I will say more about the history of reliability in my assessment of the facts at the end of a summary of the evidence, but the reliability of a number of Mr Tan's representations, although not all of them, is confirmed very much by the prisoner's presence in Australia and the role he took in negotiations which occurred whilst he was in Australia, as well as the negotiations he took part in with Jimmy and David on the telephone when Tan was calling them from outside Australia before 29 July 2011. They are also confirmed by the manner of the communications and the detail of the communications provided to the Court between Lim and unknown persons in South East Asia.

33I must say that the explanation Mr Lim gave in the psychologist's report, particularly at para 21, of his involvement in the offence is frankly, laughable when compared to the statement of facts. It follows that the prisoner's reliability as a historian is very suspect and the ultimate conclusions of the psychological report have to be approached with considerable circumspection given the significant reliability of the psychologist upon the accuracy, reliability and truthfulness of the prisoner as a historian. In fairness, the prisoner does give a history of treatment with antidepressant medication in 1998 to 2000 and does not appear to, if I could use the expression, gild the lily in relation to matters relating to his medical health. But such matters as are raised relating to antidepressant medication and the like are very remote and are disconnected to the matters with which I am now concerned. There is no suggestion of any mental illness or disability having a causal connection with the prisoner's involvement in these charges. 

34Having regard to the history he has given about his circumstances, I accept that he had a good relationship with his family and I am prepared to accept that he is a person supported by his wife and sons who have travelled to Australia to support him in these proceedings. But any suggestion that he makes about his involvement in this crime as solely a reaction to his gambling debts and business debts cannot be accepted. Nor can the psychologist's description of the prisoner's involvement in these offences as ""opportunistic"" be accepted. Based upon his own self-report, the psychologist said that the prisoner did not appear ""inherently antisocial."" 

35I point out in passing that the facts of this matter are that the prisoner's conduct and his conversations with others reveal that he was well connected with sources in China, Malaysia, Hong Kong and elsewhere that were substantially involved in the distribution of heroin and methylamphetamine from South East Asia at least to Australia. This level of access and knowledge does not fall to people who at the last minute opportunistically, or otherwise, fall into the thrall of others. If it were thus, he would have been bringing the drugs into the country as a courier, not as he was as a manager and facilitator for substantial and planned long-term imports and supplies of prohibited drugs, having a knowledge of bank accounts to which large sums of money were to be deposited. It is interesting to note that both he and Mr Tan were very careful to ensure that they at no stage did not handle any of the drugs and tried to avoid as best they could, although could not always do so, handling substantial cash payments required. Of course as I have pointed out, Mr Tan received one very substantial payment for at least one of the supplies after his arrival in Australia. 

36The psychologist's view was that the prisoner Lim requires assistance dealing with life events including problem solving and consequential thinking skills. This opinion makes an assumption, as I would understand it, that the prisoner was unable to do that to participate in these crimes. If that is an assumption made by the psychologist, I reject it. Clearly he could. He may of course need assistance in due course in relation to his gambling and financial management skills, but of course the true extent of any indebtedness or his wealth for that matter has not been revealed in the history he gave to the psychologist or in his wife's evidence which I will refer to shortly. There will be, I am satisfied, a need with the consequences of a significant incarceration, to assist him in a range of ways but such assumptions made by the psychologist about his involvement in this criminality are not valid by consideration of the facts to which there were no objection. The extent to which he needs a mental health professional or other counselling on his return to Malaysia cannot be determined with certainty if at all because his true reasons for his involvement in these crimes he has not revealed and on his wife's evidence, she has no idea.

37There was tendered in his case a short report from a psychologist practising in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia who has treated the prisoner's wife since 2009 and states that she suffers from anxiety, depression, with insomnia and has done so for the past ten years and has been receiving antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication. He wrote, 

""We treated her actively with antidepressants and mood stabilisers with supportive counselling. (She) showed significant clinical improvement remained relatively well maintained with the current medication regime and supportive counselling however (she) is still quite vulnerable mentally and is prone to relapse when under stress or any emotional upset."" 

38Optimistically, the psychologist said that it would be ""therapeutic and a great relief"" to the prisoner's wife for her husband to come and stay with her and for she to look after him and for him to give her the necessary psychological support. Obviously that will not be possible for some years. Judging from the prisoner's travels in and out of Malaysia before he came to Australia, he was not providing the constant support to her when he had the opportunity to do so. I have another medical report stating that the father of the prisoner has hypertension, has previously had prostate cancer and is current asymptomatic in relation to that. He also has dementia. 

39The wife prepared a letter the details of which she expanded upon in her oral evidence concerning the conditions of her parents-in-law, the prisoner's parents and her own family. She claimed that she was under enormous financial strain and stress to pay back the prisoner's debts and to support his family which I take to be his extended family at the time of the commission of the offences. She said it was difficult for her family to cope with him in Australia, which I can accept, at least on an emotional level.

40The prisoner also wrote a letter to the Court setting out his background and his family circumstances and claimed that his difficulties economically were the reasons for him committing these crimes. He has expressed regret at being separated from his wife and children and I accept that. But I cannot accept that he is genuinely contrite, amongst other reasons, because he has not sought to present to this Court anything like a truthful account of his involvement in these crimes and has shown no cooperation with the authorities, not that he is obliged to but in terms of s 21A (3) Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act and provided no evidence such as to satisfy the finding of contrition as a mitigating factor. He does ask for leniency and mercy, in not so many words, and also asks for a ""second chance."" 

41The prisoner's wife gave oral evidence in relation to the family's circumstances and her husband's business interests and some evidence in relation to his trips outside Malaysia before coming to Australia. It is clear that that evidence only tells part of the story. None of the evidence of the wife explains or details the circumstances in which the prisoner may have become involved in organised criminal activity as he was for at least a number of months prior to July 2011. The evidence she gave of the current financial circumstances of herself and the prisoner's family was that her family home is worth $150,000 and it has a mortgage in the sum of $100,000. This may be true, but it does not provide a full account of the financial circumstances of the family and is not supported by any independent documentation. I appreciate of course I cannot fill gaps in the evidence with speculation and I will not, but it is difficult to believe that a prisoner who is so ensconced in organised crime located in his home country might not have some financial support from that source. Clearly, he has done nothing to betray the interests of any masters he has in South East Asia anyway. That is a matter about which I cannot make a finding conclusively one way or the other. I understand, of course, that his parents and his wife's parents have medical problems and I accept that that is so but the prisoner's wife's evidence was that the prisoners siblings were ""reluctantly"" providing for the parents and it seem that no exceptional circumstances arise in relation to the welfare of the parents, particularly given both the prisoner and his wife have extended family to assist them. 

42In relation to the circumstances of the wife, she no doubt, accepting her psychiatrist's short opinion, has psychological and or mental health issues to address. But there is no evidence in that report of a deterioration since the prisoner's arrest in 2011 although she remains fragile. In any event, her condition has existed for apparently ten years, at least. The prisoner ought to have realised by coming to Australia to commit serious crimes that should he be arrested this would cause hardship to his wife and family members who are dependant upon him, but he went ahead and took that risk. 

43As was conceded in submissions, the difficulties for the prisoner's wife, his parents and her parents do not amount to exceptional circumstances, but are matters to be taken into account as hardships that may be reflected in special circumstances. I approach the wife's evidence about the family's financial circumstances with considerable circumspection because with the exception of material relating to her own health and the health of the prisoner's father, the only evidence independent of her evidence of significance is the evidence in the prisoner's passports of frequent overseas travel, which sits very much at odds with the picture painted by her of financial difficulty or his reasons for travel. Of course, the circumstances of the husband's overseas travel only emerged in cross-examination leading to the tender of the passports to which I have referred. I have already mentioned they show frequent travel outside Malaysia which remains unexplained either to the psychologist or by the wife.

44The prisoner in his personal history to the psychologist never explained why he should be in Dubai and obviously never explained to his wife his business affairs relevant to the current charges. I appreciate the wife may have been shocked by the prisoner's arrest and subsequent incarceration in Australia, but the reasons for that shock and adverse affect upon her, if any, are not fully explained by her or readily identifiable given the secrecy about the prisoner's real involvement in crime in Malaysia. If she knew that he was involved in the business of drug supply the shock would be a matter that excites absolutely no sympathy. If she is shocked because his conduct is a complete surprise to her, then she has been badly let down by her husband. The wife's evidence about her own travel with the prisoner reflected upon one trip to Macau for gambling purposes plus a trip to Thailand apparently to see temples. Again, it does not reflect upon the reality of what appears in the passport nor provide an adequate explanation for the prisoner's travel.

45She was, when confronted or challenged in relation to her evidence, a vague and unacceptable witness unable to provide even basic details about her travel that one would expect to be able to be supplied. 

46The written submissions presented to the Court on behalf of the prisoner Lim deal with issues relating to the quantity of drugs and the like. It is to be fairly said that the two supplies of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine are near the very top of the range of quantity of drugs covered by the relevant provisions relating to not less than a commercial quantity. 

47In respect of each of the drugs as I understand it the subject of the charges the commercial quantity is not less than 250 grams, the large commercial quantity is not less than one kilogram. I am mindful of course of a range of authorities and note that the quantity of the drug involved is not a sole determinant in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the criminality. I accept that the quantity of drug is a relevant matter to be considered, in the context of an assessment of the role of the prisoner in the particular supply, and other matters that are relevant to sentencing, including of course the subjective circumstances. 

48I accept in relation to the large commercial quantity of heroin supplied on 7 August, that it is at the very low end of the range of weight of relevant prohibited drug covered by the provision. That having been said, of course, that offence, the fourth offence in time, has to be seen in the context of the previous offending of the prisoner that culminated with that last offence and the interception of the prisoner by investigators. 

49In relation to the submissions of learned counsel for the accused Mr Lim it was submitted that his role was ""within a syndicate"" that cannot accurately be identified. 

50It was submitted that he was equal in culpability with Tan in a range of ways. Particularly, liaising with Tan regarding supply of drugs to a domestic syndicate, liaising with a member of the domestic syndicate to discuss the terms upon which the drugs would be supplied, liaising with an Asian syndicate member regarding delivery of the drugs for supply into the domestic syndicate, conveying bank account information from the Asian syndicate member through Tan to members of the domestic syndicate for payment of drugs already supplied, attempting to recoup payment from members of the domestic syndicate for drugs supplied. These are some of the matters that can be identified. They are accurate statements so far as they go of the prisoner's involvement. 

51All these observations are true, but they neglect to reflect the trust in the prisoner given to him by the ""syndicate"", to use the words of learned counsel, to have the authority to do the tasks. He was no courier or delivery boy. The matters identified whilst accurate and fair also neglect to reflect the direct evidence of the prisoner's involvement of negotiation of price or approval or price for drugs to be supplied. He was described in the submissions of learned counsel as a 'middleman', but the prisoner provides no detail as to who were the people at one end of the bridge at least with whom he was liaising to facilitate the supplies. 

52It is conceded in submission that such people are a well-known phenomenon of drug trafficking syndicates and such persons are integral to the success of the syndicate and deterrent sentences are required. Nevertheless it is submitted the appropriate sentence will be significantly less than that for persons more senior in the hierarchy. I will deal with that submission later after I have summarised the material in the case of Tan. It was submitted that the prisoner's reward was limited to $10,000 per kilogram as commission to be shared with Tan. 

53Although it was acknowledged the drugs would be supplied exceeding the quantities the subject of the charges the reward the prisoner was to receive was said to be modest. It is submitted that the fact that he shared the commission or profits with Tan is inconsistent with him having a role high in the hierarchy of the ""syndicate"" and being more of a middleman. Reference is made to the discount to which the prisoner is entitled pursuant to the guideline judgment of R v Thomson and Houlton. This is not disputed by the Crown and the prisoners will receive a discount of twentyfive percent each for each offence upon the otherwise appropriate sentence to represent the utilitarian benefit of the plea in each case, the prisoners having pleaded at the Local Court and been committed for sentence. 

54The subjective circumstances adverted to in the submissions include, and correctly so, the absence of prior criminal convictions which I take into account. This is not a matter of great significance in this matter for several reasons. Firstly, without having to cite authority, it is commonly held in relation to serious offences of drug supply, as these are, that absence of prior convictions is not a significant matter given the seriousness of the offending. But here, of course, we have the fact that if the prisoner was without prior criminal convictions he was involved in a series of criminal offences each themselves significant. 

55He was also, as is conceded by his counsel, involved in organised criminal activity and clearly so for some months before his arrest in relation to these matters. Thus as the facts clearly reveal, he was an undetected criminal. This is not a case of a man with no prior criminal convictions opportunistically and impulsively engaging in serious crime. In relation to his failed business ventures and his indebtedness it is asked that those matters be taken into account as reflecting upon his circumstances of involvement. 

56I cannot be satisfied as I said earlier that he relevantly had the significant indebtedness that he claims contributed to his offending. He may be indebted, as I said, but its causal connection with the offending I am not satisfied has been established. It was submitted by his learned counsel both skilfully in writing and orally that it should not be assumed that the offences were committed for greed. That submission I cannot accept, because clearly these are offences of greed and could not in any way be categorised otherwise. Even if he did commit crimes to assuage his indebtedness it would not automatically follow that he had not acted through greed in any event. 

57The facts of the matter are that as a man significantly involved in organised criminal activity in Southeast Asia, no motive has been advanced which could be accepted to justify his conduct or to in any way diminish the greed selfevident in that conduct. I am urged to consider the circumstances of his parents and his wife's parents through their illhealth. As I said I accept the prisoner has responsibility for his wife and his children, that they will miss him and this is a human component of this sentencing exercise which I am obliged to take into account. 

58On the other hand the prisoner is clearly the architect of the situation that he faces, not this Court. The Court is not responsible for any difficulties either financial or emotional that he will suffer as a result of his clearly deliberate and wellplanned behaviour. Reference is made in the submissions both orally and in writing as to the need to find special circumstances through partial accumulation and other matters that may relevantly be special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I accept some partial accumulation of sentences is itself a special circumstance and I have reflected that in the adjustment of the non parole period. 

59I have had regard to Pearce principles particularly, what was said by the majority of the court in Pearce v The Queen [1998] 194 CLR 610 at [45]. I have also had regard to decisions such as Cahyadi [2007] 168 A Crim R 41, at [12] and R v XX [2009] 195 A Crim R 38, at [52]. 

60In relation to the sentences passed upon the other offenders it was submitted that they each had differing roles and different subjective circumstances. It was conceded they each played a lesser role than this prisoner, although it was submitted Mr Chow's role was not substantially lesser than the offender and there should be only limited differentiation warranted between the sentence imposed upon Mr Lim and the sentences imposed upon Mr Chow. 

61The oral submissions of the prisoner at one point concentrated upon the need to approach the contemporaneous representations of Mr Tan about Lim, or Peter, with caution because of his knowledge of the criminal enterprise and his personal concern and involvement in the relevant criminal enterprise and events. It was also, as I said earlier, untested. Of course, I accept one must exercise caution for the reasons advanced by counsel, but it's a matter where greater caution would be required where someone criminally concerned in a particular criminal enterprise was actually giving evidence, for one's own benefit, in criminal proceedings against the accused. 

62Section 165 Evidence Act 1995 sets out matters that may be taken into account as making evidence of particular witnesses unreliable. Of course, this is concerned with the circumstance of a person actually giving evidence rather than a contemporaneous account, as a general rule. In this matter we have Mr Tan making representations in unguarded moments when his conversations are being secretly recorded. Whilst I accept that caution submitted by learned counsel must be exercised. Having exercised that caution, noting some unreliability of Mr Tan, I accept that his references to Mr Lim as being his ""boss"", in a technical sense at least, was an accurate description of his then relationship. 

63It was conceded in oral submission that much of the background to this matter is ""unknown"" in the context of the facts as opposed to the history given by the prisoner to the psychologist. I accept, however, in relation to what Tan said to Jimmy and David, that there were a number of examples of Tan talking up what he could do. Using what I would call 'sales puff' and this could have included descriptions of things that Mr Lim was doing at the time or had done in the past but it was conceded in submission that Mr Lim did play an important role and he was more than an intermediary or a subordinate to the syndicate. 

64He was not a courier. But it was also submitted he was not the ""ultimate boss"", but somewhere in between. I have taken into account all matters that were raised in those further oral submissions many of which reflected upon what was in the written submission. I was also I hasten to say referred to the decision of Buttrose which I will refer to in a moment. 

65Turning to the case for Mr Tan he, like Mr Lim, did not give evidence. He produced through his counsel a psychological report, a photograph of him with a child, some police reports from Malaysia prepared in 2009 relating to events reported to police where he was assaulted or ""kidnapped"" or placed in physical jeopardy by other people apparently in relation to debts owed by him to loan sharks as they are referred to. I was also provided with a letter from his parents dated 25 September 2012, a medical report in relation to his father, a work reference for the period 2007 to 2009 and some certificates for programs he had completed in custody. 

66A psychological report from Gareth Dawes was prepared from an assessment conducted on 20 September 2012 and sets out a deal of information provided by the prisoner and other sources including of course the police reports to which I have made earlier reference. The police reports were discussed in the course of oral submissions with learned counsel for the prisoner. I appreciate they confirm that in 2009 the prisoner was under some financial pressure at that time, but they do not, in the context of all the evidence, persuade the Court, or establish if it be a matter requiring establishment on the balance of probabilities by the prisoner, that the prisoner committed the current offences under duress. 

67In fact, I find no evidence of duress that is relevant to the offending behaviour. Of course the prisoner may have had financial difficulties at the time of the offending, but the truth is the contemporaneous records of the prisoner's representations between February and July show absolutely no hint of the prisoner acting under any outside pressure other than, of course, the pressure of completing the deal and selling drugs. The psychologist's report noted ""a range of high level reporting for problem behaviours and adverse consequences"" with ""poor problem recognition"". 

68His scoring on actuarially based testing showed him to be at the ""upper range of problem gambling"" and it was said that this pattern is consistent with dependence or addiction. In that regard, noting the submissions of counsel which I will come to in a moment, it may be that the prisoner was a problem gambler, or had debts from problem gambling before coming to Australia. But, in the context of this prisoner, like Mr Lim, not providing a coherent or reliable or truthful account of his connection with Mr Lim, the syndicate as it is described by Mr Lim's counsel in Malaysia or his involvement in the commission of this offence, no basis has been established, or can be identified, for concluding that there was a causal connection between such ""precipitating circumstances"" and his offending. 

69The prisoner is said by the psychologist to have evidenced some ""guilt"" and ""shame"" about his gambling behaviours and is thought to be in remission, or recovery, from any ""gambling dependence disorder"". The psychological survey of him in areas such as thought disturbance, antisocial tendencies, alcohol and drug addiction and the like, found no existence of antisocial attitudes or behaviours but did find poor selfesteem and the presence of ""disorganised thought processes"". 

70This matter was explained as indicating ""impact of thought processes that resulted in poor concentration"". My assessment of this analysis is that it reflects upon the current circumstances of the prisoner's custody awaiting his fate in court. There is absolutely no evidence of any psychosis or mental health problems contributing to his offending and such symptoms as are identified by the psychologist can only be seen as reactive to his current circumstances. The psychologist's testing, of course, is part based on a history provided by the prisoner which is scarcely to be regarded as completely truthful or reliable. 

71It is fair to say, however, he has not himself 'gilded the lily' and he has not sought to claim a history of violence or drug addiction or the like. The psychologist felt that there were no historical indicators existing to elevate the risk of recidivism. His clinical presentation failed to reveal any factors that might elevate current risk but he did have stresses arising from his current circumstances. He opined that the prisoner was of ""low risk of reoffending"". This would certainly be true whilst he is in Australia, unless he commits crimes in custody. Ultimately, when he completes his sentence he will be deported. 

72Recommendations in the report reflect upon the effect of a protracted sentence in a foreign country and separation from his family. It is said that absent the debt and gambling problems the prisoner would be unlikely to reoffend. The psychologist stated the prisoner would benefit from psychological assistance to address adjustment to the community and to address financial pressures. He also would be assisted by relapse prevention skills obtained by various programs in custody. I have taken into account the psychologist's report so far as can be taken as reliable given the reliance on the history of the prisoner. 

73I note in relation of course to the prisoner's history that the prisoner does not give any history of ""negative peer influences"" nor gives any indication of the influence of ""illicit substances"" in his offending. Given that there is no suggestion that he was using ""illicit substances"", it thus falls to be that the prisoner has failed to explain in any way whatsoever how he came to be associated with Mr Lim and have direct knowledge of matters pertinent to the sophisticated importation and/or distribution of drugs in Australia. As many of the conclusions in the report are based upon the truthfulness of Mr Tan again the findings in the report must be approached with some circumspection and much of the report does not address the reality of the facts of these matters and the reality of the way in which Mr Tan conducted himself in the negotiations with Jimmy and David. 

74I accept the prisoner has a child but is separated from his wife. I accept that his parents are not wealthy, they have shame from his incarceration. The mother apparently of the child has gone to live in Japan. His family are upset about his presence in Australia. They will support him on his return. I note, as I said earlier, the reference in the reports cited by the father of the treatment of the prisoner by loan sharks in 2009. The parents indicate to the Court that their son has expressed to them regret and remorse for his involvement in these crimes. It seems to me much of that regret and remorse is of the fact that he was caught. 

75They state that this will be a very painful lesson for him being sentenced in Australia which I accept. There is some financial predicament for the family and some pressure it is said upon the family from people to whom the prisoner owes money. This is a situation the prisoner has left in his family's lap and does not assist me in assessing the criminality of the prisoner. Certainly it is not a mitigating factor either. It is suggested in the letter from the father that the bad people that are pursuing him for money do not accept that he is not in Malaysia. I would be very surprised, if the prisoner does owe money to ""bad people"" that his presence in an Australian gaol could not be established to their satisfaction given his association with organised criminal elements in that country. 

76He has completed the Getting Smart program and has undertaken an English course. He acknowledges in his communication with the Court that he is aware of the serious wrong that has brought him into custody and has learned a very painful lesson. He is upset at the fact that he cannot look after his parents or his child. He asks the court to accept that he was contrite and regrets his conduct. He says that he would never commit such a wrong again in his life. I note his statements of regret and remorse but can give them little weight in the absence of a frank account of his criminal conduct. 

77I accept that his plea of guilty might be seen as evidence of contrition, but the facts of the matter are that the Crown case against both men was overwhelming, given the telephone intercepts and the listening device conversations and the objective fact of the supply of the drugs in accordance with the arrangements hatched by telephone or in the privacy of hotel rooms. As it is acknowledged in the submissions by counsel for Mr Tan, the coaccused were associates at the very least, if not members, of organised criminal elements and clearly if they have failed there may be repercussions for them. 

78I accept as a reality of the situation that if they were to tell the truth about their involvement in these crimes they would run considerable risk or their families would run considerable risks in their home countries. They are not penalised in sentencing for not telling the full story or the truth or avoiding any form of tests or proper examination of their criminality or an examination of their motives, their financial rewards and related issues. However, on the other hand, simply telling a story to a psychologist as they each did that was transparently inadequate to explain their involvement in the commission of these crimes does them no credit in relation to the issue of contrition. 

79It reveals them to be unreliable or untruthful historians and it reveals them as not being entirely frank or even partially frank in relation to their involvement in these crimes. 

80Mr Tan's learned counsel prepared detailed written submissions in relation to the criminality of the prisoner and other relevant matters to sentencing. The learned counsel referred to the standard non parole period and I will deal with that matter shortly. There was much in the written submissions on matters of legal principle from both counsel with which there could be little disagreement. 

81Duress is raised as a mitigating factor and a number of authorities are put to the court as supporting the relevance of duress falling short of a defence. I accept without any reservation that duress may be a mitigating factor if satisfactorily established. However, here there is no satisfactory evidence to establish the existence of any duress on the part of the prisoner. In that regard I note the details of two intercepted conversations in which Mr Tan refers to pressures upon him in relation to the arrangements being made with Jimmy and David. 

82These statements by Mr Tan, however, are not evidence of duress. They are merely statements of the reality of the situation that he and Lim were ultimately responsible for organising the delivery of substantial quantities of drugs on credit or on part credit and they were very anxious to ensure that they got the money otherwise there would be obvious consequences for them that have absolutely nothing to do with duress. They have everything to do with the associates that they kept or the associations they had in the drug supply business. 

83I note the submissions by learned counsel in relation to Olbrich and Raz concerning the need to identify the role of a particular offender. It is accepted by the prisoner Tan that he was a higher level of criminality than the ""three runners"", including Chow, who was ""an agent of his Hong Kong principal"" and more than a ""mere runner"". It was accepted in submissions that Mr Tan had a middleman role and exercised a degree of autonomy on a day to day basis, handling the proceeds of crime, negotiating prices, but it was submitted that he operated on instructions from others including his coaccused and that he should be differentiated from Mr Lim. 

84Of particular significance were representations that Mr Tan made to others that he had to ""connect roads .. make connections for him"", being a reference to Lim. He also made statements of the need for money from Jimmy to cover expenses. He made representations about his commission which was said to be modest and sharing in the commission with the coaccused. It was also submitted that he gave limited information in relation to bank accounts and was dependent upon Lim for that information. I accept at all relevant times that Tan spoke of Lim in his absence he referred to him in terms that indicated he was, that is Lim was Tan's boss, and he also told Jimmy and David of his need to consult with his ""boss"" to make certain executive decisions. 

85On the other hand he made a number of representations which were either incorrect, or simply untrue, or clearly 'sales puff'. For example, I am prepared to accept in his favour that his assertion that he could arrange the importation of 500 kilograms of prohibited drugs was sales puff. He said at one stage that Mr Lim was in Indonesia when in fact the passport does not reveal this to be true. Of course, at that time in June 2011, Mr Lim was in Thailand and China and possibly somewhere else. But he was not in Indonesia. Tan could have been mistaken, or he could have just been making things up. 

86I note also that Mr Tan participated in negotiations in the presence of Lim with little evidence of deferral. As was pointed out in the written submissions he did undertake important tasks without consulting Lim. I point out also the facts reveal that the contact with Jimmy which led to the downfall of these two men was developed by Tan arising out of some past association. It may be that at a later time negotiations were evidenced to be under the supervision of Lim, particularly before Lim's arrival in Australia and Lim's arrival in Australia confirms at least circumstantially that fact. 

87However, what was actually being done to give effect to the relevant supplies shows that Tan took a very active role and was deeply involved in discussions and negotiations, some of which he initiated and/or encouraged. 

88It was submitted as far as subjective circumstances were concerned I should take into account Mr Tan's relative youth. He is twentynine years of age, and his family responsibilities in Kuala Lumpur. I take these matters into account but the facts of the matter are Mr Tan is a mature man and an experienced man it would seem given his negotiations with Jimmy and could not call upon youth nor for that matter to any significant extent his ""marginal"" youth compared to that of Mr Lim. 

89Concessions were made about the offence being committed for financial gain, although it was submitted this arises out of his gambling addiction. In relation to his gambling addiction there is not sufficient evidence to accept that to be in existence at the time of the commission of the offences with which I am concerned or the leadup to the offences with which I am concerned. I note in that regard the judgment of Latham J in the decision of Le and adopt what her Honour says about the matter. This matter likewise fails in limine, so far as any ""mitigating"" aspect of gambling addiction, should there ever be such mitigation available in a particular case. 

90In relation to the issue of duress, returning to that just very briefly, as it was very much at the heart of the oral submissions made as well as the written submissions, it is apparent, without having heard the conversations of course, that in the arrangements made with Jimmy, and later David, the prisoner gave absolutely no indication of fears for his safety, personal misgivings, existence of threats, pressure upon him or anything of the sort. He was an active and willing participant in the forthcoming criminal enterprises, enthusiastic to organise his trip to Australia. In fact, he brought his wife along for a holiday apparently all expenses paid without regard of course as with Mr Lim to the consequences of their conduct upon the residents of Australia. 

91Submissions were made that I should make a finding of special circumstances based upon the material within the psychologist's report and the other features of the case subjectively, the hardship of the prisoner being separated from his family and being separated from his culture and also of course noting the need for partial accumulation of sentencing. It was submitted that I should not impose a ""crushing sentence"" upon him. I must say in relation to some of these matters, in the context of assessing his prospects of rehabilitation, the absence of any existing drug and alcohol addiction that might be said to contribute to his offending does not give much confidence in that regard. 

92It is clear, as with Mr Lim, that the prisoner was involved in these criminal offences for financial gain or for ""greed"" if one wants to put it that way. The involvement of the prisoner was not altruistic or driven by any addiction that compelled the prisoner to act 'out of character', if that be the correct expression. As the prisoner is clearly concerned and connected to criminal elements in Malaysia involved in organising substantial criminal activity, the question of the prisoner's prospects of rehabilitation are very much tied up with his capacity to separate himself from those people. 

93It is also submitted that I should accept that the prisoner has expressed remorse. Ultimately the final position is that the prisoner should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment less than that of his coaccused. 

94The Crown's submissions included an indication that there is no expected prosecution of the offenders in Malaysia. I appreciate it has got nothing to do with what I now have to do, but if these two offenders committed these offences in Malaysia I would expect that they would be subjected to penalties far harsher than can be imposed in New South Wales courts. 

95The Crown submitted that aggravating factors arising in this matter included the fact that the prisoners were involved or part of organised crime, they committed the offences for financial reward, that one or other of the offences form part of a series of criminal acts and they committed the offences without regard to public safety. The Crown agreed with Ms Fanning's submissions that I should differentiate between the two offenders and went on in some detail, which I need not reiterate concerning the reasons for that. It is submitted that there was no evidence reliable to conclude that they were, that is Lim and Tan, to share in a commission of $10,000 per kilogram of prohibited drug. 

96Mr Gartelmann, in his very brief and succinct submissions in reply, pointed the Court to material that, in fact, supported that proposition as had been advanced by him. The Crown agreed that the prisoners were facilitators for the supply of prohibited drugs from other sources. The Crown noted the need to have regard to the purposes of sentencing particularly general and personal deterrence, which I do, and noted the decision of Le particularly at [32] to which I have referred. The Crown said there were no exceptional circumstances in this case and no special circumstances I pointed the learned Crown Prosecutor to some aspects of the matter, particularly the partial accumulation of sentencing, which would constitute exceptional circumstances. 

97With regard to the comparative objective criminality of each of the offenders I have already made various observations about that. I accept that each of the offenders is more criminally culpable than Ding, Chow and Wong and in fact substantially so in each case, even allowing for Mr Chow being an agent of a Hong Kong syndicate. Mr Tan and then Mr Lim on different occasions organise Chow to be available for David and/or Jimmy and were aware of what he was doing and I note Chow's role was to handle the drugs. 

98I also note Chow was already resident in Australia, albeit on a student visa as I would understand it, he had not come to Australia, as had these two prisoners, to commit these crimes. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tan was reporting on occasions and directed on occasions by Mr Lim or acted on his approval. It is common ground on the submissions of both counsel that Lim and Tan for various reasons were responsible to a foreign syndicated based in Southeast Asia probably Malaysia. It is common ground that they were participants in organised criminal activity. But it was established from the facts provided to me that Tan undertook a large number of tasks of his own motion, or a large number of tasks within Australia, with which I am concerned, cultivating Jimmy and organising the subsequent supplies, even organising Jimmy to hide his commission from those that employed him and discussing arrangements for particular supplies or future supplies and the receipt of money. 

99He even received as I said earlier a substantial sum of money. It was submitted, as I noted, that if Lim was more senior than Tan then objectively his criminality is greater. This analysis is, with respect, flawed. I refer to The Queen v Olbrich [1999] 199 CLR 270, for example in the decision of the majority at [19] - [21]. 

100Without dwelling upon the judgment the Court noted amongst other things that in some cases it might be possible to identify different levels of culpability but then the Court went on to say:

""There are, of course, cases in which one offender is prosecuted but it is clear the importation is part of a business venture that is organised hierarchically. In such a case a distinction between courier and principal might be useful to indicate where an offender fitted into the hierarchy of the organisation and that in turn might assist in identifying the nature of the offender's criminality. But where there is no evidence one way or another to suggest that this is such a case that may not be so."" 

101The Court also pointed out that if several people are convicted of offences the distinction between couriers and principals may prove a useful shorthand description, but it may not. This point is taken up in the decision of Wong v The Queen [2001] 207 CLR 484, where the court (at pp 607-608) noted by reference to Olbrich, that in general the larger the importation, the higher the offender's level of participation, the greater the offender's knowledge, the greater the reward the offender hoped to receive, the heavier the punishment that would ordinarily be extracted. It is by these kinds of criteria that comparisons are to be made between examples of the offence and the sentences that are to be imposed. 

102But, as the Chief Judge at Common Law in the decision of Lee [2007] NSW CCA 234 said, particularly between [24] and [27], it is important to bear in mind that the offence for which an offender is to be sentenced is a breach of Australian law related to the importation into Australia of the relevant drugs.

""Whatever be the international arrangements and the complexities of the chain that makes the drugs available for importation it is the criminality involved ... which must identified. There may be a 'Mr Big' in which the mastermind of the complete enterprise but this may not mean that the role of another who is subordinate to 'Mr Big', but who has the primary responsibility for affecting (the importation) is reduced to that of a middleman who must be sentenced at a middle level of responsibility for the offence. The nature and extent of the criminal networks which exist and are capable of accumulating tens of kilograms of drugs for importation may be known or at least partially understood by those involved in the criminal investigation process. However for want of admissible evidence, they are unlikely to be known to the sentencing judge in a particular case.""

103Later on, his Honour said that the concern is with the offence and the consideration of the offender must be assessed by consideration of the involvement of the offender in the steps taken to give effect to the offence. The fact that an enterprise, even a large scale enterprise, has been created overseas before the drugs are available for importation, is of marginal relevance to an understanding of the criminality of those who actually aeffect the offence. Here I am not aware of the details of the organisation that everybody agrees exists as being at the back of the two prisoners. 

104Even if I were satisfied Lim had a form of supervisory role, it does not necessarily follow that the objective criminality of Lim is greater than that of Tan. Both offenders knew the quantity of prohibited drugs that were to be supplied. In some respects Tan may have received information from Lim, but both offenders are shown to be claiming to be sharing equally in the commission to be received. I have got no reason to doubt that they asserted that to be true, whether it was true or not I cannot say. Both offenders at relevant times from mid July onwards actively encouraged the transactions that were undertaken by Jimmy and David with the respective contacts that had been outlined. 

105If Tan was subject to direction from Lim, and from time to time required to report to Lim to receive further direction, the facts presented by the Crown show that Tan was the person who initially set up the contact with Jimmy as I said and who over a period of time advanced the prospect of a result ultimately to occur in late July and early August. On the evidence available, as opposed to speculation on what was happening behind the scenes, it is clear Tan was more actively involved at least up until mid July in making the arrangements for the visit of himself and Lim to Sydney with the approval of Jimmy and his boss David. 

106That Lim was consulting with Tan, giving him direction from time to time, has to be seen in the context of Tan as the facts indicate having the authority to make arrangements as well and to relay information back and forth as the case may be and to exercise substantial discretion and ultimately on one occasion to receive substantial sums of money. Both men was acting in various ways as brokers or facilitators for the supply of methylamphetamine coming from Hong Kong and the heroin. They both knew, as I would understand it, when the heroin was arriving in Australia even if they did not know how it was specifically imported. 

107They knew the source of the respective drugs. The facts are not entirely clear as to whether the ""organisation"" was responsible for the importation or whether they ultimately were facilitating the supply to the Australian connection of the heroin imported by another group. This brings into sharper focus the matters adverted to at [27] of Lee, even accepting the supervisory function of the prisoner Lim it has to be weighed against the greater activity of the prisoner Tan. It does not on balance establish that Mr Lim is more culpable or that his criminality is objectively more serious than Tan. 

108They both in various ways had managerial and principal roles in facilitating the various supplies with which they are charged. The question is one of determining their respective culpability not so as to increase the sentence imposed upon him Tan, or to decrease the sentence imposed upon Lim, but to give equal attribution or appropriate attribution to each of the prisoners. Ultimately the focus of the assessment of their objective criminality is upon what they did in the context of the criminal enterprise to which they pleaded guilty and then to consider the subjective circumstances accordingly. 

109Although it is true, where established, that people performing at different levels of a particular crime organisation should attract ordinarily appropriately differentiated sentences, the fact that people perform different roles or had different responsibilities does not necessarily establish satisfactorily that they were in fact operating at different levels. 

110I have had regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act there is a need for elements of general deterrence and personal deterrence in the sentencing of the prisoners and there has been nothing advanced that would diminish the relevance of that in the sentencing exercise. 

111There is a need to make the prisoners accountable and denounce their conduct. There is a need to ensure that they are adequately punished. All the aspects of the purposes of sentencing identified in s 3A arise in this matter, even the promotion of their rehabilitation. So far as relevant matters arising under s 21A are concerned, first of all, I note the terms s 21A(1) including the need to have regard to objective and subjective factors relating that affect the relative seriousness of the offence other than those matters identified in subs (2) and (3). 

112I also note, from the terms of s 21A(5), of the fact that any aggravating or mitigating factor is relevantly known to the court does not require the court to increase or reduce the sentences appropriate for the offences. I note in relation to this matter that an aggravating factor is that each of the prisoners were part of organised crime arising under s 21A(3)(n). I note that each of the offenders committed the offences for financial gain, but having noted that this is an inherent characteristic, if not an element, of the offending that carries such heavy penalties. 

113I note in one view of it some of the offences involved a series of criminal acts. But then again that is the characteristic of drug supply including various agreements for supply or ongoing supply, possession and distribution of the proceeds of crim and other features which are the very character of the principal offending and thus giving rise as I said earlier to the significant maximum penalties. I am very mindful of course in this context of the need not to doubledip given the fact that some aggravating factors identified in s 21A(2) themselves are as I said earlier characteristics of the offending which attract significant penalties. 

114I note the Crown's submissions of the character that the offences were offences committed ""without regard for public safety"". There is authority to support a substantial supply of prohibited drugs may satisfy that aggravating factor. I think it is unnecessary to identify that in this case, given the objective facts. 

115With regard to the matters arising under s 21A(3) the mitigating factors I find are, firstly, that neither of the prisoners had prior criminal convictions, their pleas of guilty are mitigating factors. I cannot conclude on balance given the lack of honesty about their background and connections that the prisoners are unlikely to reoffend or have good prospects of rehabilitation, I have earlier found that I cannot be satisfied on balance that they have shown relevant remorse as required under s 21A(3)(i). 

116With regard to the issue of parity of sentencing as it arises by consideration of the sentencing of the cooffenders, I first of all note the need to avoid justifiable sense of grievance. Particularly in relation to the fixing of the appropriate sentences, having regard to the objective criminality of the offenders. Each of the various offenders that I have identified have varying subjective circumstances although there is not a great deal of difference in the subjective circumstances between these prisoners and the others. I also note the observations of McClellan CJ at CL in Lau v The Queen [2010] NSW CCA 43, as to the legitimate and justifiable sense of grievance that might arise in failing to appropriately deal with the issue of ""special circumstances"". 

117on the issue of parity of sentencing with cooffenders I note the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Jimmy [2010] NSW CCA 60, and particularly the judgment of Rothman J and his reference to Aristotilean in principles of 'equal justice', summarised as being that alike will be treated alike and unalike will be treated to the extent of their unalikeness. Clearly heavier sentences are required of these prisoners than to be imposed upon the coaccused as was acknowledged by their counsel. In relation to the issue of the sentences of the coaccused I have taken those matters into account. In relation to the fixing of the non parole period I note that the non parole period is the minimum period of imprisonment which the crime for sentence requires to be served (Power v The Queen [1994] 131 CLR 623). 

118I note the factors relevant to fixing the sentence are the same as those or will include those required in fixing the non parole period and the weight given to each factor may differ depending upon the relevant section or part of the sentence to be determined (see R v MA [2004] 145 A Crim R 434 and Bugmy v The Queen [1990] 169 CLR 525). In assessing the sentences and the non parole periods, noting those principles, I note that the subjective circumstances of the prisoners are not really greatly dissimilar. They both will suffer much the same hardship in custody, they both have family dependents in Malaysia, neither of the prisoners has any identifiable mental or physical disability. There is no significant difference in their other subjective circumstances, by and large, both men are without criminal convictions, both men are persons who have displayed in the past some industry, although the exact extent of industry they have exercised that relates to legitimate activity is not entirely clear. 

119In the case of both prisoners I have determined by reference to all the objective and subjective circumstances that both the terms of imprisonment, the extent of accumulation and the non parole periods should be the same, so as to not give rise to that justifiable sense of grievance that I earlier referred to. I have made a finding that there are special circumstances arising pursuant to s 44, the accumulation of sentencing and the need for an extended period of supervision only marginally adjusted I hasten to say to assist the prisoners to adjust to community living. In that regard I note the decision in Rau. 

120I have had regard to comparative sentences, I have been referred to Buttrose [2011] NSW CCA 35, particularly at [40] onwards, and the various cases therein identified of Wang, Coetzee, Stankovic, XX, El Helou, Sukkar, and also cases of Lui, Liu and Huynh, Sciberras, Chen, Lawson and Aoun. They provide some assistance, but each case is different. 

121With regard to the relevance of the standard non parole period I have already pointed out I must fix a non parole period in each case, but in fixing the non parole period and considering the standard non parole period I note what was said by the High Court in Muldrock [2011] 244 CLR 120 and particularly the Court's conclusion that in fixing the non parole period in a case involving a standard non parole period is one part of the larger part of passing sentences, fixing the non parole period is not to be treated as if the standard non parole period provides a necessary starting point or an important end point in framing the exercise. 

122The exercise of the discretion to fix a non parole period and the consideration of Part 4 Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in conjunction with s 21A, requires an approach to sentencing consistent with the approach to sentencing described by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen [2005] 228 CLR 357 particularly at [51], whereby the judge endeavours to identify all the relevant factors, including those at common law, to the sentencing exercise, discusses their significance and makes a value judgment as to what is an appropriate sentence. I also note what the Court specifically said at [27] - [29] which I need not quote for the purposes of this judgment. 

123Mr Lim, if you do not mind standing thank you very much. Sir, in relation to the offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of heroin on 28 July 2011 you are convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment which consists of a non parole period of five years to commence on 9 August 2011 and to expire on 8 August 2016. The balance of the sentence is two years and six months to expire on 8 February 2019. 

124In relation to the offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine on 28 July 2011 and the further offence of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine on 3 August 2011, you are convicted, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment which consists of a non parole period of six years to commence on 9 February 2013 and to expire on 8 February 2019. The balance of the sentence of three years is to expire on 8 February 2022. The total sentence of imprisonment is nine years. For each of those offences each sentence is to be concurrent one with the other. 

125In relation to the offence of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of heroin committed on 7 August 2011 you are convicted, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment which consists of a non parole period being six and a half years, six years, six months to commence on 9 February 2015 and to expire on 8 August 2021. The balance of sentence is four years to expire on 8 August 2025. The total sentence is ten years six months. Fixing that non parole period I have made a finding of 'special circumstances' as I have for the other non parole periods that I am required to impose. You will be eligible for release to parole on 8 August 2021. Take a seat thank you Mr Lim. 

126Mr Tan would you mind standing thank you very much. For the offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of heroin on 28 July 2011 you are convicted, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment which consists of a non parole period being five years to commence on 9 August 2011 and to expire on 8 August 2016. The balance of sentence is two and a half years to expire on 8 February 2019, a total sentence of seven and a half years. 

127In relation to the two offences of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine on 28 July and 3 August 2011 you are convicted in relation to each of those offences and in relation to each offence sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non parole period of six years to commence on 9 February 2013, to expire on 8 February 2019, the balance of the sentence is three years to expire on 8 February 2022, the total sentence is nine years imprisonment in each case, each sentence to run concurrently. 

128In relation to the offence of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of heroin on 7 August 2011 you are convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment which consists of a non parole period of two years and six months to commence on 9 February 2015 and to expire on 8 August 2021. The balance of sentence is four years that will expire on 8 August 2025. The total sentence of imprisonment is ten years and six months. I make a finding of 'special circumstances' in the fixing of that non parole period as with the other non parole periods I am obliged to fix under the legislation. The total sentence to which you are subject on my calculation is fourteen years imprisonment with a ten year non parole period, the same sentence as imposed upon Mr Tan. Take a seat thanks very much.

129HIS HONOUR: Now Madam Crown are there any technical errors or mathematical errors.

130PONTELLO: Your Honour I believe there may have been a slip of the tongue in sentencing Mr Lim with respect to the second of the sentences that your Honour imposed. Your Honour stated the expiry date of the balance of term as 8 February 2012 when your Honour intended I'm sure 8 February 2022.

131HIS HONOUR: Sorry which sentence, the first sentence.

132PONTELLO: The second sentence your Honour imposed was

133HIS HONOUR: 8 February 2022 is what I meant to say yes obviously that is a slip of the tongue, I'm sorry, I've got it written out here, I apologise for that. 

134Gentlemen you will be eligible for release to parole respectively on 8 August 2021, whether you are released to parole or not will be a matter for the parole authorities it will depend upon your conduct in custody. When you are released to parole you will be taken to a detention centre under the control of the Department of Immigration and I would expect you to be promptly deported from Australia.

2761451,"R v FORREST, Kerry [2013] NSWSC 527","Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Before me is an application by the accused, Kerry Forrest, that her trial for murder be permanently stayed. 

2Put shortly, it is the Crown case that in September 2009 the accused, then aged about 50, became the carer of the deceased, a gentleman aged 83. It is alleged that she befriended him and became involved in his financial affairs. In early 2010 she and the deceased opened a joint bank account, to which each of them had access. She persuaded the deceased to put his house up for sale, the sale proceeds to be used to build a house on land which she owned. The sale of the house realised a sum in excess of $300,000, which was deposited into the joint account. It is alleged that, without the knowledge of the deceased, she withdrew most of that money and deposited it into an account of her own. 

3It is the Crown case that the accused wanted the money because she had been gambling heavily. It is alleged that she killed the deceased by administering to him tablets containing a lethal level of morphine. Her motive is said to be her desire to cover up her dishonest dealings with his money. Accordingly, the Crown case is one of premeditated murder. It is a circumstantial case of some complexity, and the trial is estimated to take up to 8 weeks. 

4The application is based upon the state of the accused's health. On this issue I have in evidence a body of medical material, together with affidavits of the accused and of her solicitor, Ms Emma Hearne. Most importantly, she suffers from cervical cancer stage 3B. She is in custody and is currently held at the Long Bay Hospital. She has received treatment at Prince of Wales Hospital. She has a number of other ailments set out in a report of Dr Jacques Ette, a staff specialist GP with Justice Health. He describes her as suffering ""multiple complex medical conditions."" His report also sets out a cocktail of medications, including pain killers, which she is taking. 

5The accused suffers from a left hydronephrosis, apparently an effect of the cancer. As I understand it, this is the result of pressure of the tumour upon the ureter, causing difficulty passing urine. It has been treated by the insertion of a ureteric stent. She suffers chronic pelvic/abdominal pain. Whether that is the result of the cancer and the treatment for it is not clear. Unrelated to the cancer, she has a swollen left leg, being a thrombus at the left common femoral vein, which is treated by anticoagulant medication. She has a history of weakness in the right shoulder, and over the last 12 months she has complained of weakness in the right arm, in the left leg, together with numbness and back pain. She had been diagnosed with chronic regional pain syndrome, and she is in a wheelchair. (She told a psychiatrist, to whose report I shall refer, that it was an injury to her back following a fall which led her to being wheelchair bound. Whether or not that is so is immaterial. It is not in dispute that she needs a wheelchair.)

6The cancer was detected late in 2012, and at Prince of Wales Hospital it was treated by radiotherapy, concluded in January of this year. She was under the care of Associate Professor Michael Jackson, a radiation oncology specialist, who has given evidence. She has also recently been examined by Dr John Schmidt, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, engaged by Ms Hearne. He has provided a report and given evidence.

7Associate Professor Jackson said that the accused has a tumour involving the cervix and the parametrium, which is the soft tissue on either side of the uterus. He also referred to the consequent obstruction of the ureter. He said that apart from radiotherapy to the pelvic area, cancer of this kind is normally treated by a form of internal radiotherapy known as brachytherapy. Dr Schmidt explained that this treatment puts the ""radiotherapy wires directly onto the tumour"", so as to have more ""direct action"" upon it, rather than ""external beam"" radiotherapy. Associate Professor Jackson said that that treatment provides ""an extra dose to the cervix itself and the immediately surrounding areas"". Unfortunately, the accused refused to undergo brachytherapy on two occasions when it had been arranged for her, and it is now too late to undertake it. 

8CAT scans conducted a week ago, on 2 May, reveal that there has been no significant reduction in the size of the tumour but there is no evidence that it had spread to the lymph nodes, liver or the chest. However, Associate Professor Jackson explained that a CAT scan might not be reliable in detecting ""small volumes of disease in other parts of the body."" For that purpose a PET (positron emission tomography) scan is preferable, but that scan would not normally be conducted until about 6 months after the completion of radiotherapy, a period which has not yet expired. 

9At the forefront of the evidence of Dr Schmidt and Associate Professor Jackson was the accused's prospect of surviving the cancer. They agreed that normally women with stage 3B cervical cancer have a 40% chance of surviving for 5 years. They also agreed that in the accused's case that prospect was reduced because she had not undergone brachytherapy. Dr Schmidt put the prospect of a 5 year survival rate at 20%, which he described as ""dismal."" Indeed, he thought it unlikely that she would survive beyond 2 years. 

10Dr Schmidt gave evidence before the recent CAT scans had been performed. Nevertheless, he explained the risk of secondary tumours spreading to other parts of the body and into the bloodstream, thereby travelling to the lungs and even to the brain. In cross-examination he said that he was ""being very lenient"" in giving the accused a 2 year life expectancy, saying that she could get ""a recurrence of the tumour within 12 to 24 months, probably more likely 12."" He added that it was a ""pretty nasty sort of tumour in terms of where it is and the organs which it involves."" Asked whether that recurrence could occur within a period of less than 12 months, he replied that it could but that it was ""hard to know."" He thought that she could ""probably get away with it"" for 8 to 10 months, but acknowledged that that was ""just an assumption."" He added, ""Medicine has vagaries and it is very, very difficult to know.""

11Associate Professor Jackson was less pessimistic about the accused's prognosis. He described prognosis as ""always very difficult."" Apart from his contact with her through treatment, he had seen her briefly at court on 6 May, when he gave evidence. He described Dr Schmidt's projection that she would die within 12 to 24 months as ""certainly unfortunately possible"", but ""pessimistic."" He suggested that her chance of being ""alive and well at 2 years"" was in the range of 25 to 30%, adding that it was ""very hard to be sure."" He thought that there was ""some possibility"" that she would survive for 5 years. He put that within the same percentage range. 

12He agreed with Dr Schmidt that there is a danger of secondary tumours, mostly in the lungs and the liver but also, less commonly, in the brain. In response to cross-examination, he could not say whether the existing tumour was still active but agreed that it could be, in which event the possibility of secondaries was ""real."" He also agreed that the accused's other health problems could affect her survival rate, saying that ""people who have other diseases ... are less likely able to fight the cancer and tolerate aggressive treatment."" In that respect he referred to her venous thrombosis and the difficulty of performing surgery on people requiring anticoagulant medication. He also referred to her mental state, describing her as ""not entirely compliant with treatment"" and saying this had made it ""difficult for her to participate as fully ... in the treatment as we would have liked."" He added that this was ""a rather vague thing and difficult to put a number on it."" As an example of this he referred to her refusal on two occasions to undergo brachytherapy, for which she gave reasons which are understandable but which he saw as ""not entirely sensible.""

13In cross-examination Associate Professor Jackson was asked questions directed to the accused's capacity to follow the course of her trial and, if necessary, to give evidence. He agreed that in his experience people diagnosed with cancer suffer depression and anxiety, which can result in a diminution of the short term memory and the ability to concentrate and to focus. He agreed that he had had difficulty with her being able to ""concentrate and make sensible and rational decisions about her treatment."" However, asked whether pain killers could have an effect upon concentration, he said that they could but that ""most people who were on a stable dose seemed to manage quite well."" Asked whether the accused might face problems giving evidence and being cross-examined if she was on a regime of medication involving regular doses which wore off before the next dose was taken, he said that that was possible ""although doctors looking after her would try very hard to avoid that."" He added that slow release tablets are available which could ""maintain a steady level in the blood rather than having something every 4 hours where the levels are up and down, which is quite difficult to manage.""

14Dr Schmidt described the side effects of radiotherapy, being inflammation to adjacent organs. Irritation of the bladder and bowel causes frequency of urine and diarrhoea, as well as nausea, all of which the accused had experienced. However, at the time he interviewed her he concluded that these symptoms ""had settled to quite a degree."" He thought she looked ""reasonably well."" In providing a history to him, he found her to be ""cognisant and quite lucid"" and he did not think that there was ""any difficulty with her mental ability."" 

15She has also been interviewed recently by Dr Robert Reznik, psychiatrist. He found nothing of psychiatric significance in her history or presentation. She recounted a very disturbed background, which need not be examined for present purposes, but which Dr Reznik described as a category of ""significant traumatic events."" Speaking, as I understand it, of her account of her background and her medical condition, he described the information she provided as ""complete and logical."" He found that there appeared ""to be no general impairment"" of her understanding persons such as himself ""or possibly other persons dealing with her legal matters."" While he acknowledged that circumstances might change in the future, he reported that ""the current review and past history"" suggested that she ""is a capable woman who would be able to manage her current circumstance.""

16In her affidavits the accused deposes that, notwithstanding the medication, she has pain, including pain and discomfort from the stent when she urinates. She experiences nausea and suffers from diarrhoea, as well as frequency of urination. She eats little because consuming food gives her stomach cramps. She is constantly tired, sleeping only for a few hours each night. These conditions, she says, affect her concentration when she tries to work on notes for her case. 

17In her second affidavit, of 8 April 2013, she deposes:

""If I was to give evidence in Court I am not confident that I could answer questions properly because of the pain, my inability to concentrate and lack of focus. I might sit there and not be able to say anything, or I could burst into tears and not be able to talk, I could be so tired from the side effects from my treatment which also interferes with my concentration. I think I might have difficulties understanding the question even though I hear it and therefore might give the wrong answer. I might be too focused on the pain to concentrate. I feel I am repetitive (even now) and cannot structure my thoughts or sentences.""

18The accused gave evidence, and was cross-examined about the material in these affidavits. To that I shall return.

19In her affidavits Ms Hearne, the solicitor, deposes that she has had a number of conferences with the accused last year and this year. From February of this year, in telephone conversations and in conferences, she has observed a deterioration in the accused's capacity to engage with her. She found the accused to be vague and apparently unable to answer questions, and became concerned about her capacity to instruct her. In a conference on 26 March 2013 she observed the accused to have difficulty recalling events that had happened in the previous days or weeks and in structuring sentences. Her head was ""dropped"" most of the time, and she appeared to be exhausted.

20On 5 and 8 April Ms Hearne conferred with the accused for the purpose of preparing her two affidavits. On each occasion this was a long process. Ms Hearne found it ""very difficult and frustrating"" obtaining the information she needed from the accused, who appeared to have difficulty maintaining attention on the matters being discussed. In these conferences the accused consistently complained of pain and tiredness and, generally, Ms Hearne observed a deterioration in her physical appearance and mental condition. Ms Hearne also expresses concern about the effect on her health of the daily regime of a trial, noting the uncivilised hours at which people in custody are taken to and from court. She foresees the accused's ""ability to comprehend and provide instructions"" diminishing ""even further as the trial progresses.""

21Counsel for the accused, Mr Grant, sought a permanent stay on the basis of what was said to be her fatal prognosis and her inability adequately to give evidence if called upon to do so at the trial. 

22He submitted that to require her to face trial would be ""out of accord with common humanity"", an expression used by Lee J in Director of Public Prosecutions v Hakim (unreported, 16 May 1988) in determining that that defendant was entitled to a permanent stay. His decision was upheld on appeal: (1989) 41 A Crim R 372, per Kirby P (with whom Gleeson CJ and Clark JA agreed) at 376 - 7. There was medical evidence that Mr Hakim, a man in his late fifties, had a long history of ischemic heart disease, complicated by a complete heart block. He had a bypass operation which led to serious complications. He suffered a variety of physical, neurological and psychological conditions, and his prognosis was poor. These conditions and subsequent treatment had affected his memory. Lee J described his medical condition as ""deplorable.""

23All this appears from the summary of the evidence in the judgment of Kirby P. At the time of Lee J's decision the matter was still in the magistrates court. What does not appear from Kirby P's judgment is that Lee J, having said that it would not accord with common humanity to allow the charges against Mr Hakim to stand, added (at p 10): 

""... the probability is that it is very unlikely indeed that Hakim will come to trial and I ask myself whether one should just wait and see or whether it is not better at this stage to bring the proceedings to an end.""

24His Honour found that the case ""just falls within the class of case which can be regarded as abuse of process."" As to that observation, Kirby P said (at 377) that it was not appropriate to consider whether it was necessary to establish an abuse of process to secure a stay in the context of the case. The President added, ""It may be argued that such a stay will be granted in other circumstances where, although there is no abuse, a trial of the accused person cannot now fairly be had."" In the seminal case dealing with this area of the criminal law, Jago v District Court of New South Wales & Ors (1989) 168 CLR 23, Deane J said at 57:

""The general notion of fairness which has inspired much of the traditional criminal law of this country defies analytical definition. Nor is it possible to catalogue in the abstract the occurrences outside or within the actual trial which will or may affect the overall trial to an extent that it can no longer properly be regarded as a fair one. Putting to one side cases of actual or ostensible bias, the identification of what does and what does not remove the quality of fairness from an overall trial must proceed on a case by case basis and involve an undesirably, but unavoidably, large content of essentially intuitive judgment.""

25In Hakim, apart from that defendant's physical health, Lee J also had regard to evidence that his memory had been affected by his conditions and to some delay in bringing the proceedings against him, while stressing that that delay of itself could not have justified a stay. Putting aside the question of delay, Mr Grant submitted that the present case is very similar to Hakim in relation both to the accused's physical illness and its effect upon her mental state.

26On the issue of the accused's ability to give evidence, Mr Grant relied upon a passage from the judgment of Adams J, with whom Hodgson JA and Greg James J agreed, in R v Littler [2001] NSWCCA 173, 120 A Crim R 512. In that case the court held that the accused was entitled to a permanent stay. He was charged with sexual assaults upon children at a boys' home alleged to have occurred between 38 and 46 years earlier. He was in his seventies, and there was psychiatric and psychological evidence establishing that he suffered from poor memory, possibly the product of degenerative brain disease. It was the combination of that condition, the long period of time that had elapsed since the offences were said to have been committed, and the consequent difficulty of marshalling relevant evidence, which led the court to decide as it did. 

27Clearly, that case is very different from the present case and Mr Grant did not suggest otherwise. However, he relied upon a passage in the judgment of Adams J at [49] in which his Honour considered what problems that accused would face in giving evidence. His Honour said:

""The ability to give evidence coherently and fluently, without substantial hesitation and qualifications, to remember the evidence previously given in the trial by other witnesses as well as one's own testimony, quickly understand questions asked both in examination in chief and cross examination and formulate responsive and consistent answers are all vital to an accused. In all of this, concentration and short term memory are crucial. Juries are quick to see hesitation as playing for time, qualifications as lack of candour, and inconsistencies as proof of fabrication. It is very difficult to dispel the negative impression these factors may create, entirely unfairly though this might be. This will not necessarily mean that the trial will be unfair, let alone that it should be stayed, but, where it results from or is connected with a substantial delay not due to the accused, it must be considered, together with the other substantial prejudicial circumstances to which I have referred, in determining whether a stay ought be granted. These problems are not merely cumulative, but each multiplies the significance of the others.""

Mr Grant cited the whole of that passage, including the last two sentences for the benefit of fairness and completeness. However, it is the preceding observations of his Honour upon which he relies. 

28In light of the fact that there was some conflict in the expert evidence as to the accused's mental state in that case, Adams J added at [55]:

""If the psychological evidence were to be led at trial, as it well might need to be to give the jury a basis for fairly assessing the applicant's evidence, if he gave any, it would add greatly to the complexity and difficulty of the issues to be considered by the jury, especially as it deals with scientific opinions in an area where lay experience and common sense are unlikely to be good guides. The differences between the expert witnesses emphasise the difficulties of assessment.""

29Relying on the evidence of Dr Schmidt, Mr Grant put it in oral submissions that the accused's ""prospects of surviving are grim"" and that ""it is highly likely that she will be dead within 2 years."" In supplementary written submissions he described her death within 2 years as ""inevitable."" This alone, he submitted, would be sufficient to justify a permanent stay. 

30However, he also relied upon the evidence of the accused's impaired concentration and focus to be found in her own evidence and, significantly, the evidence of Ms Hearne. He acknowledged the evidence of Dr Reznik that she did not demonstrate any mental impairment, and his evidence and that of Dr Schmidt that she was able to provide a lucid history to each of them. However, he submitted that in that context she was speaking of significant events in her life which she could readily bring to mind. On the other hand, he argued, her giving evidence in this trial, in the light of a complex web of circumstantial evidence, would involve a mental agility and prompt grasp of detail which are now beyond her.

31He referred to her evidence before me, drawing attention to several questions by the Crown prosecutor which were not obscure, but which she appeared not to understand and asked to be repeated or clarified. To a jury, he said, responses like that could appear as evasive and reflect poorly, but unfairly, upon her credibility. He also noted that the Crown prosecutor challenged her honesty during her evidence, putting it to her that she was exaggerating the effect of her condition upon her mental capacity. It could be that expert evidence would have to be called about the matter, which was likely to be contested and which could lead to ""a trial within the trial"" about her mental state. This, he argued, would be impracticable and unfair. The passages from the judgment of Adams J in Littler quoted above, he said, are apt. 

32Mr Grant argued that it would not be possible to fashion appropriate directions to a jury to guard against the prejudice created by the difficulties the accused would face in giving evidence, particularly if that necessitated expert evidence about her condition. It is also common ground that the accused's physical condition would require more breaks than usual during the day and, most likely, shorter sitting hours. This, he put it, would ""test a jury's tolerance."" In the light of the whole of the circumstances, he submitted, it would be inhumane to require her to face a lengthy and complex trial. 

33The Crown prosecutor raised the question whether the evidence bearing upon the accused's capacity to participate in the trial and instruct her representatives might give rise to an issue about her fitness to stand trial. In that event, an important question relevant to the exercise of my discretion in this application would be the availability of the procedures under Pt 2 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provsions) Act 1990 for the trial of the issue of fitness and, if necessary, a special hearing. This was a matter central to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v WRC [2003] NSWCCA 394, 59 NSWLR 273. It also arose in Agoston v R [2008] NSWCCA 116, in which WRC and other authorities were reviewed in the leading judgment of James J. However, of course, that is not how the accused's case is put, and in my own assessment I do not consider that the evidence goes so far as to raise an issue of fitness.

34There is no need to recite the long line of authority that the permanent stay of a criminal trial is a truly exceptional course. In Littler at [5], Hodgson JA put it this way:

""As shown by Jago v District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23, a permanent stay is a remedy of last resort, only used in most exceptional circumstances, where any trial would involve such oppressive unfairness, incapable of being overcome, that it would be an abuse of process.""

In WRC at [55], Spigelman CJ said:

""A permanent stay of criminal proceedings is a wholly exceptional intervention into the processes of the criminal law. The public interest in ensuring that persons charged with crimes are tried is entitled to significant weight in the necessary balancing process. (See, for example, Jago (at 30 and 49 - 50). Because of this, as Mason CJ said in Jago (at 34): 'a permanent stay should be ordered only in an extreme case ...'.""

35In the context of the present case, it is appropriate to add to those statements of principle an observation of Kirby P in Hakim. After referring to Lee J's conclusion that it would offend common humanity to require Mr Hakim to stand trial, his Honour added (at 377):

""It will be a rare case that intervening illness or the physical or mental condition of the accused will bring the court to that conclusion.""

36All that said, this is a distressing case on any view of it, and I have not found this application easy to determine. However, I am satisfied that it must be refused. 

37Undoubtedly, the accused is seriously ill and it is likely that her life expectancy is limited. Of course, the assessment of life expectancy can be informed only by the prognosis of an appropriately qualified medical practitioner but, as Associate Professor Jackson emphasised, no such estimate can be made with certainty. The evidence of Dr Schmidt and Associate Professor Jackson, viewed as a whole, points to the risk that she will die within 2 years but leaves open the possibility of her living beyond that time. In that respect this case is different from Hakim. As noted at [23] above, Lee J thought it ""very unlikely indeed"" that Mr Hakim would come to trial, although it is perhaps not entirely clear whether his Honour was referring to the prospect of Mr Hakim's death or to the probability that he would be so ill as to be unable to attend the trial. 

38I accept that the accused will have difficulties, physically, mentally and emotionally, in coping with her trial. I do not find it necessary to determine the question of her credibility raised in cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor, and I am content to proceed on the basis that the evidence she has given about her difficulties with concentration and focus is as she perceives them. Nevertheless, the ease with which Dr Schmidt and Dr Reznik communicated with her is significant. I do not accept that that is explained simply by the fact, as was her evidence, that she had taken a pain killer shortly before each of those interviews. More important, however, is the evidence she gave before me. While it is true that there were a few occasions on which she appeared not to understand what she was being asked in cross-examination, due perhaps to a lapse in concentration, on the whole she impressed me as being attentive to what she was asked and responsive in her answers. 

39The balancing process referred to by Spigelman CJ in the passage from WRC cited above strongly favours the public interest in the trial proceeding. The accused is charged with the most serious of offences. The facts alleged, if established, would place this crime in the higher range of gravity of offences of its kind. Because of the accused's condition this will be a difficult trial to conduct. It is most likely that the court will need to sit for reduced hours and that frequent breaks will be required. It may be that special transport to and from court will be necessary, and it will be essential that her daily medical needs are catered for.

40If she does give evidence and encounters the difficulties which she has foreshadowed, it may be that expert evidence will need to be called. That would be unfortunate but, if it has to be, so be it. The jury would assess that evidence as they would any other expert evidence, and I do not accept that the potential for unfairness to the accused could not be averted by appropriate directions. Alternatively, the question whether the trial might better be conducted by judge alone may need to be addressed. That matter was not argued, and I express no view about it.

41That the trial might face unusual difficulties is not a justification for not conducting it at all. Certainly, if the accused were found guilty sentencing would not be an easy task. A deterioration of her condition might invoke the prerogative of mercy, preserved by s 102 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That matter was not addressed in argument. 

42In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that the exceptional remedy of a permanent stay of these proceedings is called for. The application is refused.

	On 14 June 2012, verdicts of not guilty were directed in relation to counts 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
	
	
	The jury returned verdicts of guilty in relation to counts one, two, three, four, six, eight and nine on 22 June 2012.
	
	
	Counts one, two and three are contrary to s 61E(1A) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty prescribed for this offence, at the relevant time, is imprisonment for six years.
	
	
	Counts four and six are contrary to s 61D(1A) Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence, at the relevant time, is imprisonment for 12 years.
	
	
	Count eight is an offence contrary to s 61E(2A) Crimes Act. The maximum penalty prescribed for this offence, at the relevant time, is imprisonment for four years.
	
	
	Count nine is an offence contrary to s 61J(1) Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence, at the relevant time, is imprisonment for 20 years.
	
	
	I convict Mr RL of each of these seven offences.
	
	
	The proceedings on sentence have been delayed for a number of reasons. Neither side of the bar table take any point about the delay.
	


FACTS


	
	The prisoner is to be sentenced for seven offences on five occasions, committed over a period of about four years and eight months, between April 1988 and December 1992. The complainant is either the natural daughter or step-daughter of the prisoner. The complainant was born on xx 1978. She was aged between 10 years and 14 years and eight months during the period of the offences.
	
	
	The date of birth of the prisoner is 22 March 1951. He is now aged 62.
	


COUNT ONE


	
	The first offence took place between 8 April 1988 and 31 December 1989 at St Johns Park. The complainant was aged between 10 years and 11 years and eight months.
	
	
	At the family home in Hurstville Street, St Johns Park, the victim was cleaning up after dinner. The prisoner came up behind her whilst they were in the kitchen and pulled down her pyjama pants and rubbed his penis against her bottom, masturbated and ejaculated on her bottom.
	


COUNT TWO


	
	This offence took place when the complainant’s step-mother was in hospital, between 1 February 1990 and 20 February 1990. The family were still living at St Johns Park. The complainant was aged 11 years and about 10 months.
	
	
	The prisoner had the victim sleep in his bed with him. This was the first night her step-mother, ML, was not there. The prisoner, who was naked, had the victim remove her nightclothes and then “spooned” her, putting his hand on one of her breasts and his penis between her thighs.
	


COUNT THREE


	
	This offence also took place when the complainant’s step-mother was in hospital between 1 February 1990 and 20 February 1990.
	
	
	This offence took place in the lounge room. The prisoner had the complainant masturbate him by having her hand on his penis and his hand over her hand. This continued until he ejaculated.
	


COUNTS FOUR, SIX AND EIGHT


	
	This is the fourth occasion of offending. It took place between 7 August 1990 and 11 August 1990. The complainant was aged 12 years and four months. She was watching “Great Expectations” on the television in her bedroom. The prisoner entered the room and told her to take off her pyjamas. The prisoner kissed her and then tongue kissed her. While he was kissing her, he was playing with her breast. He then sucked her nipples. He then inserted his finger into her vagina, moving it around. The prisoner removed his finger and then “He was playing with my clitoris and then he put his finger back in.” (Count Four)
	
	
	The prisoner then performed, as the complainant said, “oral sex”, on her for a period of about “10, 15 minutes”. She said, “He put his tongue in my vagina, and he was licking my vagina.” (Count Six)
	
	
	The victim was crying. The prisoner then told the victim to place her hand on his testicles - his penis was erect - whilst he masturbated until he ejaculated. (Count Eight)
	
	
	She said she was crying throughout and after he left, cried herself to sleep.
	
	
	The prisoner asked her on a number of occasions if she was enjoying it, to which she answered no. She recalled him saying or making a comment like, “You’re turning into a lady now”, or “You’re getting older now, and I’ll teach you.”
	


COUNT NINE


	
	This took place when her step-mother was away visiting her daughter or her cousin. By this time, the family had moved to Griffith. This offence took place between 24 June 1992 and 7 December 1992. The complainant would have been aged between 14 years and two months and 14 years and eight months.
	
	
	The prisoner called the complainant into his room, the main bedroom, “his and ML’s room.” “He told me that he wanted to try something. He asked me to take my clothes off and lie on the bed”. The prisoner then spread her thighs apart and inserted the head of his erect penis into her vagina. She cried out “Ouch”, “Stop, it hurts” and then he stopped.
	


SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCES AND SOME SENTENCING PRINCIPLES


	
	Defence counsel concedes count one is a serious example of this offence. A matter which contributes to this is the complainant was aged between 10 years and 11 years and eight months when the offence was committed. An element of the offence is the victim is under 16. She was though at the time quite young. See PWB v R [2011] NSWCCA 84; 216 A Crim R 305 at [12].
	
	
	The defence also concede count two is a serious example of an offence contrary to s 61E(1A). The complainant at the time was aged only 11 years and 10 months. Again, I note an element of the offence is the victim is under 16. She was though at the time quite young.
	
	
	She was the same age when count three was committed.
	
	
	This matter of age in respect of each of the s 61E(1A) offences is something I will return to later in these remarks.
	
	
	I take into account the forms of sexual intercourse in relation to counts four and six are other than penile-vaginal intercourse and the careful submissions of defence counsel in this connection. The offences were, though, ones of sexual intercourse without consent, as reflected in the maximum penalty, and the complainant was aged only 12 years and about four months. Again, I am fully aware an element of the offence is under 16. She was though at the time still quite young.
	
	
	In relation to count nine, this was penile-vaginal intercourse. The complainant was aged between 14 years and two months and 14 years and eight months. Age under 16 is an element of the offence. The complainant was accordingly in the higher age range. This offence is also one of sexual intercourse without consent, as reflected in the maximum penalty.
	
	
	Pain was felt by the complainant as a result of the intercourse, although the intercourse was brief and the prisoner stopped when the complainant expressed pain and asked him to stop. The offence is made more serious because the complainant was under the authority of the prisoner. This is a feature of aggravation.
	
	
	The maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment in respect of the count nine offence reflects the seriousness with which the legislature views this behaviour.
	
	
	I note the Court of Criminal Appeal said in MH v R [2011] NSWCCA 230 digital intercourse is generally less serious than penile intercourse, particularly penile-vaginal intercourse, although there may be cases where this is not so.
	
	
	The Crown, in the written submissions, correctly notes the abhorrence with which the community views offending of this type. The Crown notes,
	


“The community regards sexual offences against children, particularly young children, with abhorrence. Young children ordinarily have little or no capacity to take measures to protect themselves from those who would commit sexual offences against them. It is incumbent upon the courts, therefore, to send a very strong message of both general deterrence and denunciation when imposing sentences for offences of this kind.”


	
	Going back as early as 1989, the Court of Criminal Appeal has repeatedly stated,
	


“sexual assaults upon young children, especially by those who stand in a position of trust to them, must be severely punished, and … those who engage in this evil conduct must go to gaol for a long period of time, not only to punish them, but also in an endeavour to deter others who may have similar inclinations.”

That is found in R v Fisher (1989) 40 A Crim R 442 (Yeldham J).


	
	General deterrence must be a significant feature of this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	Further, the offending took place over a considerable period of time, as already noted. The offending progressed and escalated from indecent assaults through to sexual intercourse without consent, digital and cunnilingus, and then penile-vaginal intercourse without consent. The factual context, the offences extending over time and escalating in terms of the sexual behaviour engaged in, discloses very serious criminality on the part of the prisoner.
	
	
	The offences charged were not isolated occasions. The offending was a course of conduct. Uncharged criminality is only relevant to deny the person leniency. It is only in this way that I take into account the other behaviour.
	
	
	I acknowledge the harm done to the complainant, as is clear in her victim impact statement.
	
	
	The Crown does not submit this is a feature of aggravation in this case pursuant to s 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), which provides, “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”. I accept this submission. I cannot be so satisfied of this beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, I do not accept the defence submission the feature of mitigation as noted, “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offences was not substantial”, is made out, even on the balance of probabilities, which is the appropriate standard. Just because an offence is not aggravated in a particular way, it does not necessarily mean the feature of mitigation is made out.
	
	
	One of the purposes of sentencing noted in s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, subpara (g), is to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. I take into account the victim impact statement in this way. I am, though, very aware the statement relates also to the effect of other behaviour referred to in the trial but not charged, and offences in respect of which the prisoner was found not guilty.
	
	
	In relation to each of the offences, there was a breach of trust. In saying that, I am mindful of the decision in JRM v R [2012] NSWCCA 112:
	


“During the appeal the Crown also drew attention to his Honour’s finding that the Applicant had committed a gross breach of trust, drawing attention to the recognition in MRW v R [2011] NSWCCA 260 at [77], that this is a concept distinct from abuse of authority that is an element of the offence (albeit, because of the possibility of double counting, one to which a sentencing judge should be careful not to give too much weight) - see MRW v R at [78].”

I give weight to this matter as noted in this case.


	
	On the other hand, I note that under authority was not an element of count nine. Both parties conceded that the feature of aggravation under authority was made out and I have already made reference to that. In addition, in respect of that offence, there was a breach of trust.
	
	
	The complainant was entitled to feel safe in her own home.
	


RELEVANT LAW


	
	As already noted, s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act applies to this sentencing. This is because although the section commenced on 1 February 2003, it applies to the determination of a sentence for an offence whenever committed. The exception to that is not applicable to this case.
	
	
	Section 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act applies to this sentencing, the transitional provision being the same as that noted above in respect of s 3A.
	
	
	Standard non-parole periods do not apply to this sentencing exercise and I take no account of them whatsoever: R v McGrath [2010] NSWCCA 48; 199 A Crim R 527, R v Lane [2011] NSWSC 289 at [59]-[62] (Whealey J). Each of the offences were committed well prior to the commencement of the standard non-parole period legislation on 1 February 2003. By the terms of cl 45 of Sch 2 of that Act, they do not apply to offences committed before the commencement of these provisions.
	
	
	The repealed s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is the relevant legislation in respect of this sentencing as it applies in relation to the determination of sentences for offences committed before 1 February 2003.
	
	
	Consistent with R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368; 130 A Crim R 481, MJL v R [2007] NSWCCA 261, RWB v R; R v RWB [2010] NSWCCA 147; 202 A Crim R 209, the prisoner is to be sentenced with respect to the range of sentences or sentencing patterns which applied at the time of the offences.
	
	
	The Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW) did not commence until 25 September 1989. Accordingly, the Probation and Parole Act 1983 (NSW) would have been the relevant legislation for most of the period in respect of count one, 8 April 1988 to 31 December 1989. Remissions were being applied to both the head sentence and the non-parole period up until 25 September 1989. I make this observation only so it cannot be said it was overlooked.
	
	
	In this case, I intend to impose a fixed term in respect of count one.
	
	
	The Sentencing Act would have been the relevant legislation in respect of the balance of the offences had the prisoner been sentenced when or about the time the offences were committed. Under that Act, the terminology was “minimum” and “additional” terms. The concept of “special circumstances” was introduced in the 1989 Act. Remissions in respect of the head sentence and non-parole period were abolished.
	
	
	I note none of the offences at the time could have been dealt with summarily.
	
	
	In respect of the s 61E(1A) offences, and indeed the s 61E(2A) offence and the s 61D(1A) offences, during the relevant period none of the available offences had as an element or a feature of aggravation child under 10.
	
	
	Sections 61A to 61G were repealed on 17 March 1991. Sections 61H to 61O were in force from 17 March 1991.
	
	
	From 17 March 1991, the offences were rewritten to commence from s 61H as noted. Sections 61L and 61M provided as follows:
	


“Section 61L Indecent assault

Any person who assaults another person and, at the time of, or immediately before or after, the assault, commits an act of indecency on or in the presence of the other person, is liable to imprisonment for 5 years.

Section 61M Aggravated indecent assault

(1)   Any person who assaults another person in circumstances of aggravation, and, at the time of or immediately before or after, the assault, commits an act of indecency on or in the presence of the other person, is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.

(2)   Any person who assaults another person, and, at the time of, or immediately before or after, the assault, commits an act of indecency on or in the presence of the other person, is liable to imprisonment for 10 years, if the other person is under the age of 10 years.

(3)   In this section, circumstances of aggravation means circumstances in which:

(a)   the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons, or

(b)   the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons, or

   (c)   the alleged victim is under the age of 16 years, or

   (d)   the alleged victim is (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender, or

   (e)   the alleged victim has a serious physical disability, or

   (f)   the alleged victim has a serious intellectual disability.”

Sections 61N and 61O were enacted as follows:

“Section 61N Act of indecency

Any person who commits an act of indecency with or towards a person under the age of 16 years, or incites a person under that age to an act of indecency with that or another person, is liable to imprisonment for 2 years.

Section 61O Aggravated act of indecency

(1)   Any person who commits an act of indecency with or towards a person under the age of 16 years, or incites a person under that age to an act of indecency with that or another person, in either case in circumstances of aggravation, is liable to imprisonment for 5 years.

(2)   Any person who commits an act of indecency with or towards a person under the age of 10 years, or incites a person under that age to an act of indecency with that or another person, is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.

(3)   In this section, circumstances of aggravation means circumstances in which:

(a)   the alleged offender is in company with another person or persons, or

(b)   the alleged victim is (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender, or

   (c)   the alleged victim has a serious physical disability, or

   (d)   the alleged victim has a serious intellectual disability.”


	
	Accordingly, the feature of under 10 was enacted. This means in relation to the s 61E(1A) and (2A) offences, the age range is much greater, being from birth to age 16.
	
	
	As already noted, at the time also, in respect of the s 61D(1A) offences, sexual intercourse without consent, there was no offence which had as an element or feature of aggravation child under 10. So equally, the age range is much greater, being birth to 16.
	
	
	The Crown properly concedes the statistics in terms of the number of cases are only sufficient to be of any assistance in respect of the s 61J offence. It remains the position though the statistics provided for the s 61J offence are for a seven year period from April 2005 to March 2012. The offence in this case was committed in 1992. Accordingly, the statistics relate to a very much later period of time.
	
	
	The Crown has brought forward some cases. The defence tendered the Schedule which was attached to the case of PWB.
	
	
	In PWB, Hulme J said the following at [68]:
	


“Although as I have said, the Applicant was entitled to be sentenced in accordance with the sentencing standards applicable at the time of his offending, in the case of the second offence, 1991, it is not easy to determine what those standards were. I have no difficulty in accepting that they were more lenient than at present. This has been recognised in Featherstone v R [2008] NSWCCA 71 at [45]; McGrath v R [2010] NSWCCA 48 at [62]; and R v RWB [2010] NSWCCA 147 at [176] and accords with my own recollection of events. However, such recognition provides no indication of what the standards were.”

The relevant period in this case is April 1988 to December 1992.


	
	No real pattern for offending of the nature committed by the prisoner is available. I am certainly of the view the standards in the late 1980s, early 1990s were more lenient. Such is my personal recollection. That, though, is only a recollection.
	
	
	In this case, I will proceed as noted in [75] of PWB:
	


“In these circumstances, the approach to be adopted is the normal sentencing approach having regard to the statutory provision relevant to the particular time - see R v Moon [2000] NSWCCA 534; 117 A Crim R 497 at [70]-[71], R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWCCA 368 at [107]. That approach allows for such assistance as may be obtained from the decisions of other judges.”

SUBJECTIVE FEATURES AND DEFENCE SUBMISSIONS


	
	The prisoner, as already noted, is now aged 62. He would have been aged about 37 to age 41 when the offences were committed.
	
	
	The prisoner does not have any prior criminal record. He is entitled to the benefit of this as a feature of mitigation.
	
	
	I accept he has good prospects for rehabilitation. I am not prepared to make a finding, even on the balance of probabilities, he is unlikely to re-offend. It is always very difficult to make a finding as to future behaviour. I make no finding one way or the other.
	
	
	I have taken into account and considered the psychological report of Dr Katie Seidler, dated 6 March 2013.
	
	
	I accept the prisoner suffers from the following conditions and these medical conditions will make his conditions of custody more onerous, although the defence concedes all of these medical conditions are currently being treated adequately within his custodial situation:
	



	
	arthritis causing joint and back pain - for which he takes Osteopanadol;
	
	
	narcolepsy;
	
	
	depression - for which he takes a derivative of Zoloft; and
	
	
	hypertension - for which he takes Coversyl.
	



	
	The prisoner is supported by his wife. This support is ongoing.
	
	
	The prisoner is serving his sentence on protection and I accept this is a more onerous form of custody. His age also makes him more vulnerable in custody.
	
	
	I accept there are special circumstances, those being as noted in the defence submissions: the advanced age of the prisoner; the medical conditions of the prisoner; that this represents the prisoner’s first time in custody; that accumulated sentences will be imposed on the prisoner.
	
	
	The allowance for special circumstances will be nine and a half months.
	


ACCUMULATION, CONCURRENCY, SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND TOTALITY


	
	The Court in every case must bear in mind the maximum penalty prescribed and the particular facts and circumstances, both objective and subjective, of the case, and the requirement for general deterrence.
	
	
	The principle of totality must be given consideration to and in relation to that principle, the matter of concurrence and accumulation.
	
	
	The effective non-parole period imposed in this case is the one which, in my view, is the least possible in all the circumstances, appropriately reflects the seriousness of the offending, the requirement for general deterrence and the subjective matters.
	
	
	I impose the following sentences:
	


Count one, fixed term of 1 year, commencing on 22 June 2012, expiring on 21 June 2013.

Count two, fixed term of 1 year, commencing on 22 June 2013, expiring on 21 June 2014.

Count three, fixed term of 1 year, commencing on 22 June 2013, expiring on 21 June 2014, to be served concurrently with the sentence in respect of count two.

Count four, fixed term of 2 years, commencing on 22 June 2014, expiring on 21 June 2016.

Count six, fixed term of 2 years, commencing 22 June 2014, expiring on 21 June 2016, to be served concurrently in respect of the sentence to be served in relation to count four.

Count eight, fixed term of 6 months, commencing on 22 June 2014, expiring on 21 December 2014, also to be served concurrently with counts four and six.


	
	I have imposed fixed terms and declined to specify non-parole periods (except for count eight, it being a term of 6 months) because of the sentence to be imposed in relation to count nine.
	
	
	Count nine, imprisonment for 3 years 6 months, commencing on 22 June 2016 and expiring on 21 December 2019. The non-parole period is 10 months, commencing on 22 June 2016 and expiring on 21 April 2017.
	
	
	The total effective sentence is 7 years 6 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years 10 months.
	
	
	You will be eligible for consideration for release to parole on 21 April 2017.
	
	
	The special circumstances are those noted in my remarks on sentence.

2761480,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Kevin Frederick Edward Gardner & Anor [2013] NSWSC 557,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), seeks prerogative relief in respect of the decision of a Local Court magistrate in the prosecution of the first defendant, Kevin Gardner, for negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. The magistrate found the charge to be bad for duplicity. The second defendant, the Local Court of New South Wales, has entered a submitting appearance. 

2Put shortly, the prosecution case is that in the afternoon of 31 July 2011, Mr Gardner was driving a tray-back utility vehicle in Cullala Road, Mayfield. He stopped in the middle of the road and began to turn right into a driveway. In doing so he came into the path of a Mazda vehicle travelling in the opposite direction, and there was a collision. As a result, two passengers in the Mazda suffered injuries which required surgery. A passenger in the front seat, Samuel Townsand, suffered a broken nose and a fractured eye socket. A rear seat passenger, Leah Bell, suffered a perforated bowel and required treatment for seatbelt burns. 

3The court attendance notice provided details of the offences in accordance with s 175(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which relevantly provides:

""(3) A court attendance notice must do the following:

(a) describe the offence, 

(b) briefly state the particulars of the alleged offence ...


...""

4In the present case the offence was described as ""negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm"", and was said to be brought under s 42(1)(b) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. The offence charged was that:

""at 1:00pm on 31/07/2011 at Tarago 
Kevin GARDNER did negligently drive a motor vehicle, to wit, Silver Triton Utility, BI60LR, upon a road, to wit, Cullala Road, Mayfield.""

(The reference to Tarago as well as Mayfield escapes me, but nothing turns on it.)

5Section 42(1) of the Road Transport (Safety and Management) Act provides:

""(1) A person must not drive a motor vehicle negligently on a road or road related area.

Maximum penalty:

(a) if the driving occasions death - 30 penalty units or imprisonment for 18 months or both (in the case of a first offence) or 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years or both (in the case of a second or subsequent offence), or

(b) if the driving occasions grievous bodily harm - 20 penalty units or imprisonment for 9 months or both (in the case of a first offence) or 30 penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months or both (in the case of a second or subsequent offence), or

(c) if the driving does not occasion death or grievous bodily harm - 10 penalty units.""

6At the outset of the hearing in the Local Court the solicitor representing Mr Gardner, Ms Younes, submitted that the court attendance notice should be quashed because it failed to particularise what was said to have been an essential element of the offence, that is, the grievous bodily harm occasioned and to whom it was occasioned. The magistrate rejected that submission on the basis that the offence created by s 42(1) is negligent driving, and the fact that grievous bodily harm was occasioned to someone was a matter going only to sentence. As her Honour put it in her reasons:

""On my reading of s 42(1)(b) there appears to me to be no requirement for the prosecution to refer to the grievous bodily harm and to whom that is occasioned in the court attendance notice. That is because the charge that is actually before the court is one of negligent driving and it comes down as a matter of sentence whether I accept beyond reasonable doubt that grievous bodily harm was occasioned to somebody or some persons ... .""

7Ms Younes' alternative submission was that the charge was duplicitous, and in the course of argument there was discussion of authorities on that question. Her Honour decided that it was duplicitous, and it is that decision which is the subject of these proceedings.

8In her reasons, her Honour noted that she had been taken to the distinction between the charge before her and the charge of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm under s 52A(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. She continued:

""Of course, with dangerous driving, if two persons are said to have suffered grievous bodily harm, that would amount to two charges before the Court and the prosecutor says that is different to what we have here.

However, bearing in mind what I have said from the common law about the need for the defendant to know what case he is meeting before he comes to court, it would have been of assistance to the defendant had the prosecution particularised that for him. There may well be a question in relation to one of those alleged victims as to whether that amounted to grievous bodily harm and if the prosecution was only going to be relying upon the other person, then the defendant would have unnecessarily had to prepare the case on both bases were the matter to have got to sentence.

I AM THEREFORE OF THE VIEW THAT THE ARGUMENT THAT THE CHARGE IS DUPLICITOUS BY RELYING UPON MORE THAN ONE ALLEGED VICTIM IS TO BE UPHELD ON THE BASIS OF THE INFORMATION BEFORE ME, AND IF THE MATTER GETS TO SENTENCE THEN THAT WILL BECOME RELEVANT AT THAT STAGE.""

9The prosecutor sought clarification that Ms Younes' application had been upheld in relation to the issue of duplicity, to which her Honour replied, ""I haven't quashed the CAN but you can only rely on one victim."" Her Honour adjourned the matter, giving directions that the prosecution inform the defence in writing what was the grievous bodily harm alleged and to which victim was it said to have been occasioned. It remains adjourned pending my decision. 

10By an amended summons in this court, the Director of Public Prosecutions seeks an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the magistrate's ruling that the court attendance notice is duplicitous and a declaration that her Honour erred in so finding.

11The principles relating to duplicity are easy enough to state, but are not always easy to apply. The Crown Advocate, Ms Adams SC, who appeared with Ms Davidson for the Director, referred to the succinct summary of them by Simpson J in R v Agius & Ors [2011] NSWSC 367, 251 FLR 375, at [53] and [55]:

""[53] ... Duplicity exists where a single charge, properly understood, alleges two or more different offences: see Walsh v Tattersall [1996] HCA 26; 188 CLR 77 at p 84, per Dawson and Toohey JJ (who dissented as to the outcome), citing Archbold: Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 44 th ed, (1995), Vol 1, p 75. In determining whether duplicity exists in a charge as framed, much will depend upon the proper construction of the statutory provision that creates the offence.


...

[55] There has been a trend to divide alleged duplicity into two kinds, labelled 'patent' and 'latent': see, for example, B v R [2008] NSWCCA 85 at, for example [11], [16]-[17], [52]-[53]. There is no clear line dividing the two. 'Latent duplicity' is sometimes referred to, perhaps more accurately, as 'latent ambiguity': Johnson v Miller [1937] HCA 77; 59 CLR 467 at 486; S v R [1989] HCA 66; 168 CLR 266 at 274; Stanton v Abernathy (1990) 90 NSWLR 565 at 669E-F; B v R at [52]-[53]. 'Latent' duplicity is duplicity that is not apparent on the face of the indictment, but can be identified on examination of the manner in which the prosecution proposes to put its case, or from the particulars supplied. Essentially, a charge is latently duplicitous if, on that examination, it can be seen that the person accused may (with respect to a single charge) be convicted of one of a number of different offences.""

12In Walsh v Tattersall, to which her Honour referred, Dawson and Toohey JJ (also at p 84) described the rule against duplicity ""as one of elementary fairness, to enable the defendant to know what it is of which he has been charged or found guilty and so that he has the opportunity of making a no case submission or a sensible plea in mitigation."" Their Honours added, by reference to authority, that ""duplicity is a matter of form, not a matter relating to the evidence called to support the count ... .""

13As Simpson J observed in the passage quoted from Agius, the determination of a question of duplicity will depend upon the proper construction of the statutory provision creating the offence. At [54] her Honour cited the following passage from the judgment of Bray CJ in Romeyko v Samuels [1972] 2 SASR 529 at 552: 

""The true distinction, broadly speaking, it seems to me, is between a statute which penalizes one or more acts, in which case two or more offences are created, and a statute which penalizes one act if it possesses one or more forbidden characteristics. In the latter case there is only one offence, whether the act under consideration in fact possesses one or several of such characteristics. Of course, there will always be borderline cases and if it is clear that Parliament intended several offences to be committed if the act in question possesses more than one of the forbidden characteristics, that result will follow."" 

14A finding of duplicity does not mean that the charge must be dismissed. Where the duplicity is patent the prosecution should be put to an election. Where it is latent various courses may be taken, including the direction of further particulars: Walsh v Tattersall per Kirby J at p 110. In the present case her Honour effectively put the prosecutor to his election by ruling that he could rely only on one victim, as well as ordering further particulars. 

15Ms Adams submitted that her Honour applied the wrong test in determining that this charge was duplicitous. Her reasons for that finding were that there was more than one person who might be said to have suffered grievous bodily harm as a result of Mr Gardner's driving, and that he would be assisted in meeting the case against him by particulars of the grievous bodily harm and the identification of the relevant victim. Ms Adams argued that, for the purpose of deciding the duplicity issue, her Honour failed to have regard to the nature of the offence created by the relevant provision. Indeed, she argued, her Honour's finding of duplicity was inconsistent with her decision not to quash the court attendance notice, which had been based upon a construction of the subsection as creating an offence simply of negligent driving, the occasioning of grievous bodily harm being a matter relevant only to penalty. 

16Ms Adams referred to authority for the proposition that a charge alleging harm to more than one victim would not necessarily be duplicitous. In Jemmison v Priddle [1972] 1 QB 489, the defendant was charged with a statutory offence of killing game without a licence, the charge arising from his shooting two deer on the one occasion. On appeal against his conviction, an argument that the charge was bad for duplicity was rejected. Lord Widgery CJ, with whom Ashworth and Griffiths JJ agreed, observed at 495 that it is ""legitimate to charge in a single charge one activity even though that activity may involve more than one act."" His Lordship continued:

""One looks at this case and asks oneself what was the activity with which this man was being charged. It was the activity of shooting red deer without a game licence, and although as a nice debating point it might well be contended that each shot was a separate act, indeed each killing was a separate offence, I find that all these matters, occurring as they must have done within a very few seconds of time and all in the same geographical location, are fairly to be described as components of a single activity, and that made it proper for the prosecution in this instance to join them in a single charge.""

17In Spry v Flynn & Duvall (Hunt J, unreported, 10 February 1983) his Honour considered an information in which the offence alleged was committing an act of cruelty ""upon several animals, to which, twenty-eight (28) cats."" There was a further charge in similar terms alleging an act of aggravated cruelty, as that expression was defined in the relevant legislation, upon six cats. The evidence was that the defendant had exposed all thirty-four cats to excessive heat by keeping them over a period of time within a campervan body attached to a truck. Six of the cats had died, giving rise to the offence of aggravated cruelty.

18Hunt J found the informations were not bad for duplicity. After referring to an article ""Duplicity in Indictments and Informations"" by William Paul (1935) 8 ALJ 430, his Honour said (at p 7):

""In my opinion, it is clear from the authorities that an Information will not be held to be bad for duplicity merely because it mentions several persons or things as having been affected by the defendant's one act. An example suggested by the informant during argument well illustrates this: 'if a person pours acid into a fish bowl, it matters not that his one act resulted in the death of numerous fish, and he could be charged with a single offence in the one Information. On the other hand, if a person beat and injured a number of animals at the same place and at about the same time, but by distinctly different acts, it would seem that he would have to be charged separately in relation to each animal.' In his article, Mr Paul poses as the relevant test: does the 'gist' of what the defendant did amount to 'one act and one entire transaction'?""

His Honour concluded that the ""gist"" of what the defendant did in that case amounted to ""one act and one entire transaction."" (This decision is reported in part in [1983] 1 NSWLR 190, but this aspect of it is not in the report.)

19In R v Harris; Ex parte Attorney General (1999) QCA 392, 30 MVR 334, the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal was dealing with a prosecution appeal against sentence for a charge of dangerous driving causing death or grievous bodily harm under s 328A(4) of the Criminal Code (Qld). Relevantly, that subsection provides:

""(4) A person who operates ... a vehicle dangerously in any place and causes the death of or grievous bodily harm to another person commits a crime and is liable upon conviction upon indictment to [provisions for penalties are then set out.]""

20A single count against the respondent charged him with dangerous driving causing the death of one person and grievous bodily harm to another. Although it was not necessary to determine the sentence appeal, counsel asked the court to express a view whether the count was bad for duplicity. Pincus JA, with whom de Jersey CJ and Thomas JA agreed on the point, held that it was not. 

21Pincus JA considered authority on duplicity, including Jemmison v Priddle, and observed at [26] that it is not necessarily the case that ""there are, in general, as many offences as victims."" His Honour concluded at [28]:

""In summary, there are three considerations which appear to point in the direction of holding the present indictment not to be duplex: that on the face of the definition of the offence in the Code its substance or essence is the wrong operation of the vehicle, rather than its result or the circumstances attending it; that treating such a case as the present as involving one offence only appears to produce a result conforming with commonsense and fairness, particularly since the other view could give rise to many offences consequent upon a single collision; that there was only one activity or transaction.""

22Thomas JA added the following observations at [40]:

""If the single act of driving causes multiple deaths or grievous bodily harm, there is no good reason why all such results should not be included in the one indictment although proof of one of them is enough to justify conviction of the crime there defined: ie the offence which renders an offender liable to a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment. The combined consequences of the criminal act of the offender are of course relevant to the overall question of penalty. Double punishment does not result, as the same overall result would be expected if the conduct and its consequences had been subdivided into concurrent offences. In my view under s 328A(4), both in principle and in practice, an indictment with a single count containing the full result of the criminal act is a more satisfactory procedure than an indictment with multiple counts based on subdivision of the results of the criminal act.""

23As to the desirability of furnishing Mr Gardner with particulars, Ms Adams referred to well established authority that a court of summary jurisdiction has an implied power to order particulars in any case where it is necessary to meet a defendant's entitlement to know the charge he or she is called upon to meet. The principle was restated, with reference to authority, by Campbell JA (with whom Mason P and Tobias JA agreed) in Knaggs v Director of Public Prosecution (NSW) & Anor [2007] NSWCA 83, 170 A Crim R 366 at [52], [69] - [71]. The power is not confined to charges found to be bad for latent duplicity, as Simpson J recognised in R v Agius (supra) at [65]. In the present case it was open to her Honour to have ordered the particulars she did even if she had not found duplicity in the court attendance notice. 

24Counsel for Mr Gardner, Mr Barrow, took issue with her Honour's view that the offence under s 42(1) was simply the negligent driving, and that the occasioning of death or grievous bodily harm was a matter going only to penalty. He argued that where either of those consequences is alleged it was an element of the offence. He noted that the subsection provides for a fine only if the driving does not result in death or grievous bodily harm, but provides for much higher fines and significant terms of imprisonment if one or other of those outcomes is occasioned. 

25Mr Barrow referred to the elements of the offence under s 42(1)(b), and the form of charge for that offence, set out in Butterworths' publication Criminal Practice and Procedure NSW, Volume 4 at [27-80, 665-660]. The form of charge alleges that the accused ""... did drive a motor vehicle ... on a road/road related area negligently thereby occasioning grievous bodily harm to [name of victim]."" The elements of the offence are set out as:

(1) The accused drove a motor vehicle negligently;
(2) on a road or road related area;
(3) a person suffered grievous bodily harm;
(4) the grievous bodily harm was occasioned by the negligent driving of the accused.

26That said, Mr Barrow took the view that by referring to the offence in the present case as negligent driving ""occasioning grievous bodily harm"", the court attendance notice sufficiently specified that outcome as an element of the offence charged. For that reason he did not challenge her Honour's refusal to quash it. Ms Adams embraced her Honour's view, accepting (as did her Honour) that even though the occasioning of death or grievous bodily harm went only to sentence, it would need to be established beyond reasonable doubt.

27It is true that, on a literal reading, s 42(1) appears to create an offence of negligent driving, with paragraphs (a) - (c) providing for maximum penalties for that offence varying according to the circumstances specified in each paragraph. Nevertheless, the approach urged by Mr Barrow has much to commend it. However, this matter was not fully argued and I prefer to express no concluded view about it. In the event, it does not need to be decided for present purposes. 

28On the question of duplicity, Mr Barrow submitted that the offences of negligent driving causing death or grievous bodily harm take their place in a category of offences of that kind of escalating gravity. He cited a passage from the judgment of Howie J in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102, 195 A Crim R 1, a Crown appeal against sentence for manslaughter arising from a motor vehicle accident. His Honour said at [56]:

""As the law presently stands, there is a rational, logical and cohesive hierarchy of offences concerned with the infliction of death or serious injury by the use of a motor vehicle. The offences range from negligent driving causing grievous bodily harm (s 42(1)(b) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act with a maximum penalty of 9 months imprisonment) through the driving offences in the Crimes Act to manslaughter by gross criminal negligence. All of these offences involve varying degrees of negligence, however the actual conduct may be described, ranging from a lack of care and proceeding through dangerousness to culpable negligence ... ""

29Obviously, a charge of manslaughter arising from a motor vehicle accident could relate to one victim only. The same is true of the offences of dangerous driving causing death or grievous bodily harm under s 52A of the Crimes Act. That section provides for dangerous driving occasioning death in subs (1), and an aggravated form of that offence in subs (2). Dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm is to be found in subs (3), and an aggravated form of that offence in subs (4). It might be noted that that legislative scheme is different from the Queensland provision considered in R v Harris (supra). It is accepted that a charge under any one of those subsections can relate to one victim only, and that has been the invariable practice in this State. 

30Mr Barrow argued that the same approach should be taken to the framing of a charge under s 42(1)(a) or (b). If it were otherwise, he said, a single charge under either of those paragraphs could be laid irrespective of the number of persons who were killed or who suffered grievous bodily harm. That is the approach to be found in the passages from the Criminal Practice and Procedure set out above, the form of charge and elements of the offence for both paragraphs being expressed in a relevantly similar way. That approach, Mr Barrow submitted, ""achieves clarity, certainty and particularisation.""

31Mr Barrow referred to the disapproval expressed by Kirby J in Walsh v Tattersall of what he perceived to be a recent tendency to relax the strict requirements of pleading a criminal charge. His Honour said at pp 110 - 12:

""With all respect to those who are of a different view, I cannot agree to any reduction in the strict approach to resolving questions of duplicity in the pleading of criminal charges. A strict approach has been consistently applied by this Court from Johnson v Miller [(1937) 59 CLR 467] through Iannella v French [(1968) 119 CLR 84] and up to S v The Queen [(1989) 168 CLR 266], the latter being decided in 1989. Quite apart from the consistent application of the authority of this Court, there are reasons of legal principle or policy which favour the approach of this Court and which resist the approach which has apparently found favour in England and New Zealand. These reasons are:

1. Compliance with the rule of strictness is a correct practice to require of prosecutors. It obliges them, at the outset of criminal proceedings, to define with accuracy each criminal offence which they intend to prosecute and to identify, in respect of each, the elements of the offence necessary to secure a conviction.

2. The rule of strictness is also desirable for the fair trial of the accused, basically for the reasons identified long ago in Johnson v Miller ... and restated in S v the Queen ... . The rule helps to address the attention of the accused (and any legal representative the accused may have) to the elements of each alleged offence. It assists in decisions about how to plead. It clarifies contested questions about the admissibility of evidence relevant to the offences so specified. It contributes to accurate sentencing where a conviction is recorded upon those offences. It also avoids later problems with respect to pleas of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict.


...

5. A holding which would diminish the stringency of this Court's past authority would encourage imprecision in criminal pleading where precision is desirable. It would condone a slackness in the pleading of criminal charges which this Court has hitherto rejected. It would substitute pious words for a strict legal practice which the courts uphold. As this case demonstrates, precision is often needed because the point is not immediately seen by the accused or those representing the accused. Not all accused are legally represented. Those who are may not be adequately represented. The availability of legal representation in cases involving offences such as those charged here may decline with other demands on public legal assistance. It is therefore desirable that this Court's instruction should be addressed to the practices of prosecutors and to the attention of judicial officers.""

(By way of explanation of those last statements, that case was also concerned with a summary prosecution.)

32No one could deny the force of those observations. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the charge in the present case is not bad for duplicity. On its proper construction, s 42(1)(b) penalises negligent driving which causes grievous bodily harm, whether to one person or more than one. To adapt the language of Bray CJ in Romeyko v Samuels referred to at [13] above, the provision penalises the act of driving if it possesses the forbidden characteristics of being negligent and having caused grievous bodily harm, to whomever that harm may have been caused.

33Section 52A of the Crimes Act creates distinct offences of dangerous driving causing death or grievous bodily harm to a person. The approach in this State to framing charges under that section is consistent with that legislative framework, and recognises the gravity of the offences with which it is concerned. As I have said, the approach in R v Harris was directed to a different legislative scheme in Queensland and does not represent the practice here. Nevertheless, for present purposes, I find the observations of Thomas JA quoted at [22] above helpful. While the maximum terms of imprisonment under s 42(1) for negligent driving causing death or grievous bodily harm are significant, they are relatively modest. This reflects the fact that, although the consequences of the negligent driving are serious, the culpability of the driving itself is relatively low. Where negligent driving has caused grievous bodily harm to more than one person, it is appropriate that those consequences be embraced in one charge. As Thomas JA observed, those ""combined consequences"" are relevant to the ""overall question of penalty.""

34Of course, whether or not it is strictly an element of the offence, if grievous bodily harm is alleged the defendant must be made aware of that fact and be supplied with adequate particulars of it. The proper practice, in my view, is to specify that allegation and provide brief particulars of it in the court attendance notice. Depending on the circumstances of the case, it may be necessary for the prosecution to provide fuller particulars of the grievous bodily harm separately. What should be the approach where an accident has caused both death and grievous bodily harm is not a matter which needs to be decided in this case, and I express no concluded view about it. However, notwithstanding the view of the court in R v Harris, I would think it preferable that they be the subject of separate charges, given that those two consequences are dealt with in separate paragraphs and carry different maximum penalties. 

35Accordingly, I am satisfied that the magistrate fell into error in the present case and that the Director is entitled to the order and the declaration sought. The matter must be remitted to the Local Court to be determined according to law. Mr Gardner is to pay the Director's costs, but I note that the Director seeks no more than the amount Mr Gardner could obtain by way of a certificate under the Suitor's Fund Act 1951. I shall consult the parties as to the form of order under that Act which should be made.

36I request the parties to bring in short minutes to give effect to my ruling, in relation to substantive relief and costs.

2761497,Payda v R [2013] NSWCCA 109,"Judgment

1Hoeben CJ at CL: I agree with Barr AJ.

2Latham J: I agree with Barr AJ.

3Barr AJ: Yogesh Anant Payda has applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by Judge Bennett, SC in the District Court. 

The Facts

4The applicant was born on 6 April 1981 and named Yogesh Chandra Soni. In 1993 he changed his name to Yogesh Payda. In 1996 he changed it to Yogesh Anant Paida. He married Nerissa Nickl in 1996. Her father is Peter Nickl. In 2003 he applied to American Express for a credit card, using his wife's name. That was done without her knowledge. He also applied for and obtained a secondary card in his birth name. He ran up a bill exceeding $18,000 and his wife was obliged to enter into an agreement with American Express to discharge the debt. She agreed to do so rather than report the applicant's fraud to the police out of a desire to protect the two children of their marriage. She left the applicant in 2007 and it took her until 2010 to pay off the debt.

5On 8 June 2008 the applicant began serving sentences for a number of frauds he had committed. He was housed at Silverwater Correctional Centre and there met a fellow inmate, John Arthur Blaikie. Mr Blaikie had two bank accounts containing sums exceeding $100,000. The applicant was due to be released on parole and told Mr Blaikie that he had nowhere to live. Mr Blaikie agreed to let him live at his house in a Sydney suburb. He supplied details of the address as well as his mobile telephone number. The Probation and Parole Service refused to approve the applicant's residing at Mr Blaikie's premises and when he was released to parole on 10 March 2009 the applicant lived in other premises, approved by the Service. He changed the residential address registered on his driving licence to Mr Blaikie's address. He rented a Post Office box and provided the false driving licence as evidence of residence. He was obliged to stay in touch with the Probation and Parole Service and for that purpose supplied particulars, including Mr Blaikie's telephone number. 

The first offence: obtaining a financial advantage by deception

6Mr Nickl had an American Express card. Between 31 May and 1 December 2005, without Mr Nickl's knowledge the applicant applied to American Express for a supplementary card on the same account. American Express issued the requested card and the applicant ran up a debt of $68,550.40. Mr Nickl reported the matter to the police in 2010. The applicant was convicted of obtaining a financial advantage by deception, contrary to s 178BA Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for an offence under that section is imprisonment for five years.

The second offence: stealing property from a dwelling house

7After his release to parole on 10 March 2009, the Applicant collected Mr Blaikie's house keys from Mr Blaikie's son. Using them, he entered Mr Blaikie's house and stole a quantity of personal possessions, including a fur coat, watches, cash and foreign currency. All the items were recovered in due course from the applicant's premises. Stealing property from a dwelling-house is contrary to s 148 Crimes Act 1900 and attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment for seven years. 

The third offence: obtaining a financial advantage by deception

8On 14 May 2009 the applicant sent a facsimile to Mr Blaikie's bank, purporting to be from Mr Blaikie, requesting-

(1)that the bank use a Post Office box identified in the facsimile for correspondence;

(2)the transfer of $1,500 from Mr Blaikie's passbook account to his cash investment account;

(3)that the bank supply appropriate forms of authority for another person to operate Mr Blaikie's account because of his disability;

(4)the closure of Mr Blaikie's passbook account; and

(5)that the bank open a pensioner security account in Mr Blaikie's name, with cheque book access. 

9The applicant provided his own mobile telephone number as a contact number for Mr Blaikie. 

10The bank complied with the requests, opening a new pensioner security account in Mr Blaikie's name. The closing balance of his passbook account, $77,839.91, was transferred to the pensioner security account. The bank sent to the Post Office box address supplied an application for a key card, a cheque book and internet banking linking the cash investment account and the new pensioner security account.

11Between 18 May and 4 August 2009 the applicant reduced the balance in the pensioner security account from $77,839.91 to $19.14 through internet banking, ATM transactions and cheque transactions. 

12This offence was contrary to s 178BA Crimes Act 1900.

The fourth offence: making a false statement to obtain money

13On 13 March 2009 the applicant applied online to Bank West in the name of Yogesh Anant Payda for a housing loan $350,000 for the purchase of a dwelling worth $500,000. He gave Mr Blaikie's address as his residential address and said that he had rented there for five years. He provided a false driver's licence and said that he was employed as a legal professional, naming a company, and had been for four years and eight months. He said that he earned $138,000 per anum and had $400,000 in savings and a car worth $80,000. He declared that the information was true and correct and that no information had been withheld. He was unemployed and in receipt of Centrelink benefits. 

14This offence was contrary to s 178BB Crimes Act 1900 and attracted a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment. 

The fifth offence: obtaining a financial advantage by deception

15On the 14 August 2009 a visa card issued to another person was used to register fraudulently the company the applicant named as his employer in the fourth offence. The transaction was made without authority. 

The sixth offence: making a false statement with intent to obtain money

16On 27 August 2009 the applicant enquired online to a finance broker for pre-approval of a car loan, using an Optus wireless service email address. The applicant gave his name as Yogesh Anant Payda and gave a mobile telephone number. He said that he was in full time employment and needed to borrow $35,000 over four years. He provided Mr Blaikie's address. At the company's request the applicant forwarded a written application, saying that he received a car allowance of $8,500 per annum. He provided a false driver's licence. He falsely stated that he had been renting his current premises for four years and nine months. He used Mr Blaikie's name as a personal referee and gave a false address for him. He falsely stated that he was employed as a technical manager for the company previously referred to and said that he had worked there for four years and seven months and had a monthly income after tax of $4,800. He said that he had $43,000 in cash in the bank and a home valued at a sum a little short of $500,000 which was subject to a mortgage of $350,000. He knew that these statements were untrue.

The seventh offence: forging a Commonwealth document for a person to accept as genuine

17The applicant provided a further document for the finance broker seeking finance through Esanda. He supplied an Australian Taxation Office notice of assessment in his own name. It had been altered to represent the year ending 30 June 2009. The address and issue date had been altered. The document was intended to be used dishonestly to induce the broker and Esanda to accept it as genuine. Relying on it, Esanda approved a loan of $36,670. On 7 September 2009 the applicant signed a loan contract with Esanda as well as a formal credit application and an assessment report declaring the information provided to be true and correct. The commission of this offence enabled the applicant to acquire a motor vehicle.

18This was an offence contrary to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), s 145.1 (5), and attracted a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment. 

The eighth offence: using a false instrument with intent to induce another person to accept it as genuine

19On 14 August 2009, using a company registration agency within the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the applicant lodged online a form applying for registration as an Australian company and gave a proposed company name and a proposed principal place of business. The director and shareholders were listed as Mr Blaikie. A false share certificate purporting to be in Mr Blaikie's name was used. Payment was made using a Visa card purporting to be in Mr Blaikie's name. Mr Blaikie had nothing to do with the application and knew nothing of it. 

20The offence was contrary to s 300(2) Crimes Act 1900 and attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.

The ninth offence: obtaining a financial advantage by deception

21Between 14 October and 5 November 2009 the applicant made a number of unauthorised transactions the total value of which exceeded $14,000, using an American Express card issued in a name not his own. He also used Mr Blaikie's name and address, providing forms purporting to have been signed by Mr Blaikie, who knew nothing of these transactions. 

The tenth offence: obtaining a financial advantage by deception

22A member of the Royal Australian Navy lost an Australian Defence Force credit card issued by Diners Club. The applicant acquired the card and used it to conduct transactions worth $ 1,705.33. In doing so he called himself John Blaikie. 


The eleventh offence: obtaining money by deception

23The applicant was living at Colo Vale and fire damaged his premises, rendering them uninhabitable. His former wife allowed him to move into her premises while he looked for somewhere to stay. Between 19 January and 17 February 2010, while living at his former wife's house, he gained access to her bank account and transferred $6,800 from that account to an account of his own in another institution. When she asked him about the matter he told her that the bank had made a mistake and that he would try to sort it out.

24His former wife reported him to the police and they arrested him. 

25When sentencing the applicant for the first offence his Honour took into account his criminality in 13 other offences of fraud under the law of New South Wales. His Honour summarised those offences thus at RS 23-27:

The first is, obtain money by deception contrary to s 178BA (1) of the Crimes Act. In June 2005 the offender obtained a Mastercard from Bankwest in the name Peter Nicol without the victim's knowledge. He withdrew funds from the account via automatic teller machines and paid for holidays at Airlie Beach and Daydream Island. The amount of that fraud was $3,928.

The second offence is making a false statement to obtain money, contrary to s 178BB (1) of the Crimes Act. In June 2005 the offender made an application to Bankwest for a Mastercard in the name of Peter Nicol. He completed the application and signed as Peter Nicol. He provided particulars of a referee in the name Dr Yogesh Anant Payda of an address in Wentworthville with a stated occupation of medical practitioner. A Mastercard was issued with a credit limit of $4,000. In November 2009 Peter Nicol received a final notice in relation to the debt accrued on a credit card. It was then $5,891.62.

The third offence is making a false statement contrary to s 178BB (1) of the Crimes Act. On 12 March 2009 the offender made an application to BMW Finance in the course of negotiations to acquire a four wheel drive BMW motor car. He completed the application in the name of Yogesh Ananpayda of the Carlingford address. He provided a contact phone number. He represented his employer to be NSR Industries Pty Limited of which he had been a director for four years. The company did not exist at that time. He gave the name of John Blaikie of Carlingford as a personal referee. He provided a false computer generated payslip representing a monthly salary of $6,416.66. The application was approved by BMW Finance for the sum of $52,795. This was intended to be used to acquire a motor vehicle.

The fourth offence is making a false statement, s 178BB of the Crimes Act. On 29 May 2009 the offender made an internet application to the ANZ Bank for a low rate Mastercard. He represented his employer to be NSR Industries of Campbelltown. He gave a mobile phone number and an email address. He intended to obtain credit facility to an amount of $5,000 by way of that application.

The fifth offence, making a false statement, s 178BB of the Crimes Act. On 16 June 2009 at Mittagong the offender applied for a tenancy in a property at Colo Vale through a real estate agent at Mittagong at a rent of $680 per week. He made the application in the name Yogesh Anant Payda and provided a false driver's licence number and false occupation. He gave the name of John Blaikie as a personal referee. He claimed to be the legal director of NSR Industries of Carlingford with a salary of $110,000 and $35,000 investment income. He was looking to obtain a benefit of $17,678.64 representing the value of the rental accommodation that he was seeking.

The sixth offence is making a false statement, s 178BB of the Crimes Act. Between 5 August 2009 and 5 September 2009 the offender completed a pre-approved credit application and submitted it to Platinum Car Loans to finance an Audi Q5TDI vehicle for the purchase price of $70,000. He gave a false address and false particulars. He claimed to be the manager of NSR Industries of Colo Vale where he had been employed for seven years and six months with a salary of $91,000. He claimed to have $350,000 in superannuation and cash in a bank account amounting to $43,000. He gave John Blaikie of Mittagong as a referee. He completed a declaration that the contents of the application were true and correct.

The seventh offence, s 178BB of the Crimes Act, on 18 September 2009 the offender made application to the Shell Company in the name of John Blaikie for a fuel account. He represented that he was John Blaikie a director of NSR Industries at Colo Vale. He claimed a fuel bill of $5,000 per month. The guarantor was nominated as John Blaikie of Carlingford and it was witnessed in the name Oesh Soni of Mittagong. He intended to obtain $5,000 credit each month by means of these representations.

The eighth matter, making a false statement, again s 178BB of the Crimes Act. On 22 December 2009 Telstra Business forwarded a sales enquiry to a Telstra dealership following an on line request by the offender using the name Ogesh Aida of NSR Industries of Colo Vale and Mittagong. He was looking to obtain three Apple iPhones as authorised signatory for the company; the total cost of the phones over twenty four months was $6,408.

The ninth matter, using a false instrument, s 300 (2) of the Crimes Act. As part of the application to BMW Finance the offender provided a copy of a New South Wales driver's licence by fax. It purported to be the licence of Yogesh Anant Payda with a changed address to Sunnybank Queensland with the offender's date of birth. The number was changed to a number that did not exist in the licence's registry in New South Wales. 

The tenth item is using a false instrument again contrary to s 300 (2) of the Crimes Act. The offender provided a letter of employment to a real estate agent at Mittagong purporting to be from NSR Corporation dated 10 June
2009. The letter represented him to be a full time employee of the company with the position of legal director since 2005 and a salary of $110,000. The letter was signed John Blaikie, director. It contained a false ABN. It was to obtain rental premises.

The next item is using a copy of a false instrument contrary to s 301 (2) of the Crimes Act. The offender received correspondence from Bankwest in relation to the application he submitted to obtain finance in March 2009. He made significant alterations to the correspondence and used the altered document for other fraudulent activity. It falsely represented that he was in the process of purchasing property in Mittagong. He used this document by way of a fax to induce Esanda Finance to approve an application for a loan of $41,690.18.

The next item is using a copy of a false instrument, s 301 (2) of the Crimes Act. He supplied a false PAYG payment summary to Esanda Finance between August and September 2009 in an attempt to obtain finance. It misrepresented his address to be the Carlingford premises. It showed gross payments of $75,000. It purported to be signed by John Blaikie. The document was in fact signed by the offender.

And the final New South Wales offence to be taken into account is the use copy of a false instrument, s 301 (2) of the Crimes Act. On 22 December 2009 the offender applied to Telstra Business for three smart phones and faxed a copy of his New South Wales driver's licence, which had been altered in respect of the number. It was sent to a Shane Penrose of Accent Business Technology. It was part of the scheme upon which he had engaged to obtain the three Apple iPhones.


26When sentencing the applicant for the seventh offence, a Commonwealth offence, his Honour took into account the applicant's commission of two other Commonwealth offences. His Honour summarised them thus at RS 33-34:

The additional offences to be taken into account on that matter are the [appropriation of] an article from the post, contrary to s 471.1 (1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code Act. On 12 March 2009 the offender, having been released from custody on 10 March, attended Mittagong post office to rent a post box, as earlier described. He provided false and misleading particulars on the application, including the Carlingford address. He provided his real driver's licence, which was accepted for identification purposes.

He then caused all mail directed to John Blaikie, care of the Carlingford address, to be delivered to the post office box at Mittagong. The offender intercepted and opened the mail addressed to Blaikie.

The Commonwealth Bank had re-directed correspondence to the post office box in relation to the accounts of John Blaikie at the request of the offender, as earlier described.

The other Commonwealth offence is connect to a network with intent to commit a serious offence, contrary to s 474.14(1) of the Criminal Code. The offender became acquainted with a person named Ali Kocer in custody. Kocer has an extensive history of fraud. 
The offender used a telecommunications network with the intention of obtaining from Kocer stolen credit card numbers, which the offender intended to use to commit further serious offences.

The investigators were able to access the stored information in the form of text messages and conversations stored in an Apple iPhone, revealing the details of conversations between the offender and Kocer.


The Antecedents

27The applicant had a substantial record of offences of dishonesty. There were other offences as well, but I can leave aside consideration of them. 

28On 29 August 1989 the applicant committed one offence of forge and another of utter. In the District Court he was given the benefit on each of a recognisance to be of good behaviour for three years.

29Between October 1988 and February 1989 he misappropriated property and stole property. In the Brisbane Magistrates' Court he was given the benefit of a recognisance for two years.

30On 10 July 2006 he was arrested on four charges of obtaining money by deception. In the Local Court he was convicted and sentenced on each to imprisonment for 12 months. On appeal to the District Court the sentences for two of the offences were reduced to nine months' periodic detention and on each of the others he was given the benefit of a two year bond.

31On 9 January 2008 the periodic detention orders were revoked, probably as a result of the next succeeding matter.

32On 16 February 2008 he was charged on two counts of obtaining money by deception. In the Local Court he was convicted and sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment on each. On appeal to the District Court he was sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment on the first and 10 months' imprisonment, including 6 months' non-parole, on the second.

33On 30 July 2008 he was charged on ten counts of obtaining money by deception. In the Local Court he was convicted and sentenced to a number of concurrent terms of imprisonment which amounted to a sentence of 12 months' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 months. The commencement date of the sentences was 21 January 2010. On appeal to the District Court the commencement date of the sentences was changed to 12 March 2010, making his earliest release date 11 December 2010. 

The Applicant's Subjective Case

34The applicant did not give evidence before his Honour. A report of Tim Watson-Munro, consultant forensic psychologist, was tendered. His Honour's summary and findings were expressed thus at RS 38-42-

The only material that has been presented on his behalf is a sympathetic report from psychologist Tim Watson-Munro who describes the offender in the consultation on 15 February 2011 as a co-operative though highly anxious man. He is said to have a complex clinical history compounded in recent times after having sustained a fracture to the right femur whilst showering in prison. There is no suggestion that that was suffered other than in a simple accident when he slipped over. It resulted in surgery in hospital where he remained for four days.


He has been diagnosed with osteoporosis; he is also lactose intolerant; he was submitted to psychometric testing which indicated a high degree of unresolved symptomatology. It is said that his condition has been aggravated by his insight to the seriousness of the current matters before the Court and in this context, he acknowledged, that he would benefit from appropriate treatment both in gaol and upon the completion of his non-parole period. This appears to have been a realisation that has come to him late in the sequence of events when one considers the prosecutions that preceded this.

He was born in Fiji in April 1961 of Indian descent. He has three sisters aged 48, 45 and 40 and they have with him a positive and supportive relationship. One lives in Brisbane and the others are both overseas. His parents of 75 years of age are domiciled in Brisbane. The offender came to Australia at an early age and spent three years in primary school in country New South Wales until the family relocated to Brisbane. There he attended high school. He left school at 18 after completing the equivalent of the Higher School Certificate and matriculated to the University of Queensland where he completed a science degree majoring in computer sciences over three years. Upon graduation he worked for a computer company for about five years. He then returned to university and commenced a masters degree in quantum physics which continued for about six years. He reports that he was advised that a further two years study would lead to his PhD but at that point he developed an interest in the law.

There has been a history of employment in various capacities including with an environmental company in New South Wales installing solar power equipment. It is said that he was working in this capacity at the time of his arrest. There is a name for the company given in the report; I have nothing from the offender to confirm the representations attributed to him by Mr Watson-Munro.

Prior to his arrest he was living in Brisbane with his parents for nine months during which he said he was working for a vending company. He was married at the age of 22 to a woman of 18 years. This was arranged, they were together for eight years, and they have a 21 year old. That marriage failed and he remarried in 1996. He is now separated from his second wife after his most recent custodial sentence. She is 30 years of age and they have a 13 year old son and a 12 year old daughter. He maintains contact with his children by telephone. He said there were on going stressors in the marriage and he said that his former wife had taken out apprehended violence orders and so had he.

It is said that he has a long standing depression, anxiety, and a low self esteem, compounded by what is said to be his forensic history and his failed marriages. At 42 years of age he began gambling in the context of falling in with the wrong company. The gambling was predominantly on horses on the weekends. He claims to have lost three homes and the total of approximately $1.2 million over a seven year period. As time passed his gambling escalated to on-line bets with the TAB and this led to the deterioration of his second marriage. He said that he would start at the TAB at 11am and would remain there until the last race. Apart from the impact on the marriage this was deleterious to his financial circumstances.

In conjunction with gambling he would abuse alcohol. He denied the use of illicit drugs. There is said to have been an attempt at marriage counselling through agencies including the Salvation Army, a private practitioner and a psychologist in Mittagong. These were not to any avail however. Following his separation he lived with his parents and claims that he had no difficulties there because he was supported and loved. Separation occurred, he said, about four years before the preparation of this report, which was 11 May 2011.

He said he wanted to come to New South Wales to see his children and to apply for joint custody but when he returned here there was a re-engagement with gambling which escalated in his depressed and anxious state. In the course of this he would self medicate with excessive use of alcohol. He is said to have detoxified whilst incarcerated and although he has had no treatment he has insight into the nexus between his psychologicalproblems and his offending. When eventually released he will return to Queensland. He is attributed with the following history and I quote from page 2 of the report.
""To closer history taking Mr Payda stated that in the lead up to the offences he was in a state of financial desperation. He stated that he had separate accounts to his wife and that he owed her money and with her putting pressure on him to repay the debt. It was in this context that he evidently attempted to take out loans by using her name. He stated that the loss of his properties which in total had incurred substantial mortgages to fund his addition further reduced his self esteem, with him owing about $8,000 per month with him earning approximately this in the absence of gambling. He stated however that he was also in a negative equity position and constantly chasing his losses.""

He is isolated in Goulburn prison where is being held. His parents are burdened with ill health; his father suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure and his mother with arthritis. She is apparently in remission from breast cancer, diagnosed two years ago after chemo and radiotherapy. His sense of guilt has been increased because of the impact of his incarceration upon his parents. Despite his criminal history he wishes to study law. This is suggested to reflect of a high degree of naiveté in terms of his perception of events.

The psychometric testing is said to have confirmed his high level of unresolved psychological distress particularly in relation to depression, anxiety and low self esteem. He suffers chronic sleep disturbance, diurnal variation of mood during the day as is typically encountered, it is said, with addictive disorders with a tendency toward highly impulsive behaviour when under emotional distress. It is said that he is now socially withdrawn and feels considerable guilt regarding his actions and the impact his behaviour has had on significant others in his life. In item 3 beneath the heading Opinion it is written

""Your client satisfies the requisite diagnostic criteria for a gambling [addiction], and adjustment disorder with features of major depression and a substance abuse disorder involving alcohol, according to DSM-IVTR criteria. His clinical picture has been compounded by a range of health problems inclusive of a recent fracture to the right femur which required surgical intervention. He is enduring chronic pain at the site of the break and despairs for the future. Appropriate testing confirms the level of his malaise in the present.

(4) On a more positive note however he is well supported by his elderly parents who are insistent on him returning to Queensland upon his release from gaol. He is also meditating and reading both Hindu and Buddhist texts. It is clear however that this man requires intensive psychotherapy and given the level of his depression in all likelihood appropriate psychotropic medication. This should occur in prison and beyond with him receiving cognitive behaviour therapy focussed upon the underlying causes of his gambling [addiction], his depression, anxiety and low self esteem, coupled with specific training addressing relapse prevention in terms of both his gambling and binge drinking. He impresses as an intelligent individual and I believe with appropriate structure, supervision and treatment some positive gains can be achieved in terms of his forensic prognosis.""

I view the representations attributed to the accused with circumspection as suggested by the Court of Criminal Appeal should occur when there is no evidence that has been presented in such a fashion that it might be tested: R v Qutami (citation omitted).

35For the State offences his Honour imposed an aggregate sentence comprising a head sentence of 5 years and 9 months, commencing on 11 December 2010 and ending on 10 September 2016, and set a non parole period of 3 years, expiring on 10 December 2013. In accordance with s 53A (2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 his Honour specified the sentences he would have imposed for the individual State counts thus -

37The effective sentence for all offences was a head sentence of 5 years and 10 months with a non parole period of 4 years. 

The Grounds of Appeal
The applicant was not represented by any legal practitioner in his appeal. He framed his own grounds of appeal and filed written submissions. 

Ground 1: On sentencing Hon Bennett DCJ taken into account' Federal offences dating 20th July 1990 and placed undue weight.

38Particulars of the applicant's prior offences were put before his Honour. That was appropriate, since his Honour was required to consider whether his prior criminality might properly be regarded as an aggravating feature or, should his Honour consider the record of previous convictions not to be significant, as a mitigating feature entitling the applicant to a more lenient sentence. Having reviewed the applicant's prior conduct and having considered submissions made on his behalf, his Honour said this at RS 42-43-
It is acknowledged that he is not entitled to any leniency from what otherwise will be a proportionate sentence because of the antecedent he has accumulated and the commission of these offences whilst subject to conditional liberty in many cases. 

39I have read the whole of the rest of his Honour's long and careful remarks on sentence, but nowhere does it appear that his Honour regarded the applicant's record as aggravating his criminality. His Honour's findings went no further than to establish that the applicant was disentitled to leniency on this account. 

Ground 2: Appellant pleaded guilty in Goulburn Local Court and was given maximum sentence on Sequence 13

40The applicant submitted that his Honour gave no weight to his early plea of guilty but imposed the maximum sentence for the first offence.

41The transcript shows that the applicant has misunderstood what happened on sentence. His Honour acknowledged at RS 19 that the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court and stated his intention to allow a discount of 25 per cent in acknowledgment. In fulfilment of his intention his Honour took a starting point of 5 years, the maximum sentence for the first offence, and reduced it to 3 years and 9 months. The applicant does not take the point in his written submissions but I should remark that a sentence which takes at its starting point the maximum available period of imprisonment might at first seem harsh. However, his Honour took into account the 13 other frauds, one of which was committed in 2005 and the others between the middle and the end of 2009, any of which, if individually charged, would have exposed the applicant to a sentence in a range up to 5 years and for which he was otherwise to receive no sentence.

42In my opinion the starting point and the sentence of three years and nine months arrived at by his Honour were within the proper limits of his Honour's sentencing discretion.

Ground 3: Guilty pleas entered on Sequences 56, 20, 19, 30, 31, 36, 29, 50, 59, 58 are subject to discount which was not given or indicated otherwise

43Under this ground the applicant repeated the assertion that his Honour failed to reflect his early plea of guilty in the sentences imposed for the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh counts. 

44The applicant is mistaken. His Honour stated at RS 10-
The offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court...he may accordingly receive a discount of 25 per cent from the sentences that might otherwise have applied...

45His Honour repeated at RS 19 that the applicant should have a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of his pleas. There was a further reference at RS 43. 

46When sentencing the applicant for the State offences his Honour imposed an aggregate sentence pursuant to the provision of s 53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1990. That was a sentence of five years and three months. In doing so his Honour stated, as required by subs (2) (b), the sentence he would have imposed for each offence. They are set out in the table above next to the applicable maximum sentences. They vary between one year and three years nine months. It cannot be demonstrated from the individual hypothetical sentences that his Honour did not give effect to his stated intention, nor can that conclusion be drawn from the resulting aggregate sentence. 

47The same may be said about the Commonwealth offence, the seventh offence, which resulted in a head sentence of three years 10 months. The maximum penalty was imprisonment for 10 years.

48This ground of appeal has not been made good.

Ground 4: Appellant placed in custody on 12 March 2010. As appellantwas arrested on these offences the commencement date shouldreflect such.

49The applicant was arrested on 12 March 2010 and held in custody charged with the present offences. However, he was not held in custody for the present offences alone. He had been sentenced on 21 January 2010 in the Local Court at Penrith to periods of imprisonment of 12 months dating from that day. He appealed to the District Court and on 10 May 2010 the Court ordered the sentences to commence on 12 March 2010, the day of his arrest. The offences concerned were 10 counts of obtaining money by deception, committed on 30 July 2008.

50The applicant's counsel on sentence submitted that his sentences should be backdated to commence on the 12 March 2010. His Honour declined to do so and said this at RS 18-19 -

Counsel submitted that although it was within the Court's discretion to commence the sentences I am about to impose on the date of the expiration of the non-parole period most recently served, that is 11 December 2010, I might still consider that the overlap between the periods of offending to be such that the commencement date should be earlier. The premise advanced was that if the investigation had been more efficient, all matters would have been brought to account within the same time frame, with an appropriate structure of the sentences with concurrence as well as accumulation to properly reflect the totality of the offending upon which he engaged. His ready pleas to the present matters might also bear witness to the course the offender would have taken had the matters now before the Court been charged earlier.

Implicit in the submission is the proposition that there has been a measure of delay for which the offender ought not to suffer, for the conduct of the prosecution of these present matters was beyond his control. Against the analysis of the history of the criminal misconduct of the offender, I am not persuaded that in the exercise of my discretion I ought to commence these sentences before 11 December 2010.

51Although his Honour had the discretion to start the sentences on 12 March 2010, as the applicant's counsel submitted, his Honour was bound to regard the seriousness of the offences for which the applicant was then serving sentences. His Honour was entitled to regard 10 instances of obtaining money by deception as substantial and I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in declining to backdate the sentences as requested. In my opinion his Honour's rejection of counsel's submission fell within the proper bounds of his sentencing discretion.

Ground 5: Sentence of Federal offences to commence after State offences that is being served and failure of court to explain sentence

52The applicant submitted that in fixing the commencement date of the Commonwealth offence, offence 7, his Honour erred in not complying with the requirements s 19 Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 

53At the time of sentence the applicant was serving the sentences for the 10 counts of obtaining a financial advantage by deception which commenced on 12 March 2010. The longest of those sentences were of 12 months, expiring on 11 March 2011, with non-parole periods of 9 months expiring on 11 December 2010. 

54Section 19 is as follows-
Section 19 Cumulative, partly cumulative or concurrent sentences

(1) Where a person who is convicted of a federal offence or federal offences is at the time of that conviction or those convictions, serving, or subject to, one or more federal, State or Territory sentences, the court must, when imposing a federal sentence for that federal offence, or for each of those federal offences, by order direct when the federal sentence commences, but so that:

(a) no federal sentence commences later than the end of the sentences the commencement of which has already been fixed or the last to end of those sentences; and

(b) if a nonparole period applies in respect of any State or Territory sentences-the first federal sentence to commence after the end of that nonparole period commences immediately after the end of the period.

(2) Where:

(a) a person is convicted of 2 or more federal offences at the same sitting; and

(b) the person is sentenced to imprisonment for more than one of the offences;

the court must, by order, direct when each sentence commences, but so that no sentence commences later than the end of the sentences the commencement of which has already been fixed or of the last to end of those sentences.

(3) Where:

(a) a person is convicted of a federal offence or offences, and a State or Territory offence or offences, at the same sitting; and

(b) the person is sentenced to imprisonment for more than one of the offences;

the court must, by order, direct when each federal sentence commences but so that:

(c) no federal sentence commences later than the end of the sentences the commencement of which has already been fixed or the last to end of those sentences; and

(d) if a nonparole period applies in respect of any State or Territory sentences-the first federal sentence to commence after the end of that nonparole period commences immediately after the end of the period.

(4) For the purpose of fixing the commencement of a sentence under this section, a reference in this section to a sentence the commencement of which has already been fixed includes a reference to another sentence imposed at the same time as the firstmentioned sentence.

55His Honour ordered the sentence for offence seven to commence on 11 December 2012. It was submitted that in order to comply with the requirement of s 19 (1) (b) the sentence had to commence at the latest on the expiry of the non-parole periods of the sentences I have mentioned. 

56The purpose of s 19, it seems to me, is to ensure that when sentences for Commonwealth offences are grafted onto the terms of existing sentences, the custody they mandate should be continuous. So if the only sentences under consideration had been those dealt with at the District Court and that for the seventh offence the requirements of s 19 would not have been met. There would have been a gap of two years between the expiry of the non-parole period of the former and the commencement of the latter.

57But that argument does not take into account the existence of the other sentences for which his Honour had to impose sentence or the effect of s 16E Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Section 16E is as follows - 

Section16E Commencement of sentences

(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the law of a State or Territory relating to the commencement of sentences and of nonparole periods applies to a person who is sentenced in that State or Territory for a federal offence in the same way as it applies to a person who is sentenced in that State or Territory for a State or Territory offence.

(2) Where the law of a State or Territory has the effect that a sentence imposed on a person for an offence against the law of that State or Territory or a nonparole period fixed in respect of that sentence:

(a) may be reduced by the period that the person has been in custody for the offence; or

(b) is to commence on the day on which the person was taken into custody for the offence;

the law applies in the same way to a federal sentence imposed on a person in that State or Territory or to a nonparole period fixed in respect of that sentence.

(3) Where the law of a State or Territory does not have the effect mentioned in subsection (2), a court (including a federal court) in that State or Territory that imposes a federal sentence on a person or fixes a nonparole period in respect of such a sentence must take into account any period that the person has spent in custody in relation to the offence concerned.


58His Honour was aware of the provisions of the section. At RS 46 his Honour said- 

I note that, pursuant to s 16E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth), the commencement of sentences and the commencement of non-parole periods governed by the law of this State will apply to the offender for these Federal offences subject to the provisions of subs (2) and subs (3) of s 16E. Thus for the Commonwealth offence, Sequence 36, and taking into account the additional offences that are included in the form relevant to that, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment of three years and ten months. That sentence shall commence on 11 December 2012 and expire on 10 October
2016.


59His Honour was thereby satisfied, as he was entitled to be, that he could apply the law of New South Wales in selecting a commencement date for the sentence on the Commonwealth offence. By s 47(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1990-
(2) A court may direct that a sentence of imprisonment: 

(a) is taken to have commenced on a day occurring before the day on which the sentence is imposed, or

(b) commences on a day occurring after the day on which the sentence is imposed, but only if the sentence is to be served consecutively (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively) with some other sentence of imprisonment.


60The sentence imposed by his Honour accorded with subs (2) (b). It commenced on a day after that on which it was imposed and it was partly concurrent with other sentences imposed at the same time. Moreover, the result of all the sentences imposed was that there was a continuous period, beginning on 11 December 2010 and ending on the expiry of the Commonwealth non-parole period on 10 December 2014, during which the applicant was to be held in custody without eligibility for parole. So the provisions of s19 were met.

61It was submitted also that his Honour failed to explain the sentence to him as required by s 16F Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).

62The section is as follows- 

Section 16 F Court to explain sentence 
(1) Where a court imposes a federal sentence on a person and fixes a non-parole period in respect of the sentence, it must explain or cause to be explained to the person, in language likely to be readily understood by the person, the purpose and consequences of fixing that non-parole period including, in particular, an explanation: 

(a) that service of the sentence will entail a period of imprisonment of not less than the non-parole period and, if a parole order is made, a period of service in the community, called the parole period, to complete service of the sentence; and 

(b) that, if a parole order is made, the order will be subject to conditions; and 

(c) that the parole order may be amended or revoked; and

(d) of the consequences that may follow if the person fails, without reasonable excuse, to fulfil those conditions. 

(2) Where a court imposes a federal sentence on a person and makes a recognizance release order in respect of that sentence, it must explain or cause to be explained to the person, in language likely to be readily understood by the person, the purpose and consequences of making the recognizance release order including, in particular, an explanation: 

(a) that service of the sentence will entail a period of imprisonment equal to the pre-release period (if any) specified in the order and a period of service in the community equal to the balance of the sentence; and 

(b) of the conditions to which the order is subject; and

(c) of the consequences that may follow if the person fails, without reasonable excuse, to fulfil those conditions; and 

(d) that any recognizance given in accordance with the order may be discharged or varied under section 20AA. 


63At RS 48 his Honour said this-
In relation to the Commonwealth offences upon which I have sentenced you in respect of one and taken the other two into account, I have imposed a sentence of three years and ten months commencing on 11 December 2012 to expire on 10 October 2016. I've specified a non-parole period of two years to expire on 10 December 2014. You will be eligible for consideration for parole at the expiration of that period.

You will be first eligible for consideration of parole in these matters on 10 December 2014 and after that time you will be subject to parole until 10 October 2016, assuming that you are able to persuade the parole authorities that you are deserving of parole.


64In my opinion what his Honour told the applicant complied with s 16F. 

65This ground of appeal has not been made good.

Ground 6: Appellant's health not fully taken into account

66It was submitted that his Honour had not comprehended the full extent of an accident the applicant had suffered while being held in custody. The only evidence of this lay in passages in the report of Mr Watson-Munro. In his introduction Mr Watson-Munro said this -

Your client describes a complex clinical history which has been compounded in recent times by him sustaining a fracture to the right femur whilst showering in prison. He was evidently conveyed by ambulance to the Prince of Wales Hospital for surgery on the injury where he remained for four days.

This was approximately three months prior to my assessment of him in February. He stated that he has now been diagnosed with Osteoporosis and that he is also lactose intolerant. Your client's problems were noted at a clinical level and confirmed through appropriate psychometric testing, which indicates a high degree of unresolved symptomatology. His condition has been aggravated by his insight to the seriousness of the current matters before the Court and in this context he acknowledged that he would benefit from appropriate treatment both in jail and upon the completion of his non parole period.

67Under the heading Drug, Alcohol, Psychological and Gambling History Mr Watson-Munro included this paragraph -
Mr Payda acknowledged a substantial escalation in his depression since his re-arrest which has been further compounded by his fractured femur and hospitalisation. He reported very poor sleep and claims to have lost approximately 17 kg in weight. He is a vegetarian with low levels of iron and claims that during the course of the surgery he required four pints of blood. He stated that he has had no treatment in prison but attempts to deal with his problems through meditation. He is evidently of Hindu extraction.

68Finally this appeared under the heading Opinion -
3. Your client satisfies the requisite diagnostic criteria for a Gambling Addiction, an Adjustment Disorder with features of Major Depression and a Substance Abuse Disorder involving alcohol, according to DSM-IV TR criteria. His clinical picture has been compounded by a range of health problems inclusive of a recent fracture to the right femur which required surgical intervention. He is enduring chronic pain at the site of the break and despairs for the future. Appropriate testing confirms the level of his malaise in the present.

69His Honour dealt with the topic in these words at RS 38 - 
The only material that has been presented on his behalf is a sympathetic report from psychologist Tim Watson-Munro who describes the offender in the consultation on 15 February 2011 as a co-operative though highly anxious man. He is said to have a complex clinical history compounded in recent times after having sustained a fracture to the right femur whilst showering in prison. There is no suggestion that that was suffered other than in a simple accident when he slipped over. It resulted in surgery in hospital where he remained for four days.

He has been diagnosed with osteoporosis; he is also lactose intolerant; he was submitted to psychometric testing which indicated a high degree of unresolved symptomatology. It is said that his condition has been aggravated by his insight to the seriousness of the current matters before the Court and in this context, he acknowledged, that he would benefit from appropriate treatment both in gaol and upon the completion of his non-parole period. This appears to have been a realisation that has come to him late in the sequence of events when one considers the prosecutions that preceded this.

70It seems to me that what his Honour said in that extract adequately summarised what Mr Watson-Munro had said. There was no evidence to the effect that the injury had caused the applicant any hardship in custody or that it would render his imprisonment more burdensome. Neither was there evidence that his medical needs could not be met while he was in custody. It seems to me that on the material put before his Honour there was no case for mitigation on any ground of that kind.

71The applicant appended to his written submissions copies of documents produced by Justice Health. They comprised clinical notes dealing with his accident and the treatment administered. They could all have been subpoenaed to be produced at the District Court for the sentence and no reason is advanced why they were not tendered in that Court. However, I have read them. They really take the matter no further than the position his Honour understood to obtain. They would not advance his case or give any more support for an argument on mitigation on the ground of the state of his health than was available before the sentencing Judge. 

72This ground of appeal has not been made good.

The Application Generally

73Although there is no ground of appeal that complains that the total effective sentence imposed was excessive, the applicant has said or implied that that was so. I have considered the totality of his criminality and the total effective sentence imposed by his Honour. In my opinion the sentence imposed fell within the proper range of his Honour's sentencing discretion.

74I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.

		23 May 2013",2013-05-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761502,R v Christopher Patrick GIBBS [2013] NSWDC 187,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1I am sentencing Christopher Gibbs for raping a woman. He has pleaded guilty to an offence which is called sexual intercourse without consent. That is made into a crime by the Crimes Act 1900, s 61I. Parliament regards it as a very serious offence and has fixed a maximum of 14 years imprisonment to the crime. Not only that, Parliament has in addition fixed a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment for that crime. 

2What happened is set out in the agreed facts, which became part of exhibit A. The victim of the offence I will refer to as AM, so that she may not be identified. She was 27 at the time of the offence and suffered some form of developmental delay. She and Christopher Gibbs had met some years before in a church group. 

3AM was walking along the main street in Lithgow on 24 February 2011. She tripped and fell over. Mr Gibbs went to her assistance. Extraordinarily he also put his hand around her waist and started to kiss her. She objected to this. Mr Gibbs offered her some water and took her to his unit which was nearby. Inside he took her to the bedroom, pushed her onto the bed and started to sexually assault her. AM asked what he was doing, and said that she did not know him. She wanted to go. Instead, Mr Gibbs undid her jeans and took them off. He then sexually penetrated her. He in explicit terms put his penis into her vagina. 

4As if this was bad enough, he was not wearing a condom and he ejaculated. In fact the evidence is that his semen was detected in her vagina. AM was left with a sore vagina and was understandably in tears afterwards. She then left the unit. 

5The prosecution accepts that the assault was committed by Christopher Gibbs whilst he was reckless as to whether or not AM was consenting.

6When she got home, AM complained to those that she was living with and she was taken to the police and to hospital. 

7Some months later, on 17 June 2011, Christopher Gibbs was arrested and charged. There is in fact also before the court a detailed assessment of AM by a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Bruce Westmore. It is unusual to have such an assessment of the victim of an offence. Dr Westmore concluded that while ""any sexual assault is traumatic for the victim, [AM's] personality and intellectual problems would have potentially made the assault even more traumatic for her."" He considered the assault ""to be substantial in terms of its impact on her."" He qualified that remark by explaining that he was not clear as to the legal definition of ""substantial"" and appropriately pointed out that it was for the court to decide. Dr Westmore had diagnosed that the victim had pre-existing post traumatic stress disorder and he thought it likely that that was exacerbated. Dr Westmore also had said that the sexual assault perpetrated by Christopher Gibbs on this woman ""would have aggravated those pre-existing psychological and psychiatric problems."" 

8I accept that what Dr Westmore said. It states in very articulate terms the impact which such a crime has on the victim. It explains why the community regards this as such a serious sexual assault. I do not regard it as being in the category where it could be said to be an exceptional impact and therefore should be taken into account specifically as an aggravating factor under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That is not in any way to diminish the impact which this crime has had on AM. It was a very serious crime and has had a significant impact upon her, as these crimes do have on the victims. 

9Mr Gibbs comes before the court with a very long criminal record, despite the fact that he is just short of 30 years of age. He had offences which were dealt with in the Children's Court and since he has become an adult, he has been sent to prison for crimes of violence, including maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and robbery in company. In fact since the offence was committed and whilst he was in custody bail refused on this charge, he was sentenced for some driving offences and spent some 11½ months serving a non-parole period in respect of those offences. 

10Mr I.H. Nash of counsel, who appears for Mr Gibbs, has tendered a psychological report by the forensic psychologist, Anna Robilliard.

HIS HONOUR: I will just pause there, there is no pre-sentence report is there here. There is? No?
NASH: No your Honour that's right.
HIS HONOUR: No, no, no that is right I have not missed anything.

Ms Robilliard set out some personal information about Christopher Gibbs which came from various sources, including her interview with him. He has had a history which involves a good deal of drug taking. In fact he has engaged in taking a wide range of different prohibited drugs. He admitted that at the time that he raped AM, he had been using heroin. Ms Robilliard noted in his report that he had been depressed for most of his life and she also noted that there was some history of suicide attempts.

11Christopher Gibbs, who is an Aboriginal man, was raised by foster parents. He does not know the identity of his biological father. He has had, I accept - and in these terms I accept Mr Nash's description - a very difficult upbringing and, as Mr Nash said, on any view that was an appropriate description. The reason that I describe his upbringing in such general terms is that I regard his own history, as related to Anna Robilliard, as somewhat unreliable. His condition, it was noted, has produced inconsistent accounts of his own history and he was not called to give evidence. He has been living essentially on Centrelink benefits since 2000 - over about the last 10 years. He had a relationship for some 5 years with a woman, but that has now broken up since he has been charged with these offences. 

12After administering intelligence tests, Anna Robilliard concluded that his IQ was somewhere at the boundary between the upper end of the extremely low range and the lower end of the borderline range. She thought that his scores in that and other tests would place him into the mild mental retardation range. She noted that there was no indication that Christopher Gibbs has ever been diagnosed with a mental illness, but thought it ""more likely that he suffers severe personality disorder of a borderline type."" She noted a feature of such a diagnosis is ""instability and unpredictability of moods and behaviour."" He has longstanding emotional and behavioural instability and is liable to have seizures. 

13I have also considered the other material tendered by Mr Nash, including some school reports, which also noted a mild intellectual disability. I have seen his School Certificate results and certificates from a course which he undertook whilst he has been bail refused in custody. 

14Finally, Mr Nash tendered a letter from Mr Christopher Gibbs, addressed to 'The sentencing Judge' where he explained how he wishes to change his life and the impact of losing the relationship with his partner. He wants to change his outlook altogether.

15I was assisted by submissions from Mr Nash and from Mr S.J. Modder, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions. Mr Nash argued that I should allow a discount of some 15 to 20 per cent, for his plea of guilty. A chronology provided helpfully by Mr Modder indicated that the plea was very late. But in fact, as Mr Nash pointed out, his client had been charged with a more serious offence and there were evidently negotiations and evidence gathering associated with whether that charge would proceed. Once the charge was fixed as the present offence, and not the more serious one, a plea of guilty was entered on 23 November 2012. I regard that as a reasonably recent plea and I would regard an appropriate discount as 20 per cent to acknowledge that plea. 

16Mr Nash pointed out - so far as the seriousness of the crime committed by his client was concerned - that it was committed recklessly as to the consent of its victim rather than with full knowledge and emphasised that it was spontaneous and short in a period of time. However, I also take into account, as Mr Modder point out, that Christopher Gibbs did not use a condom and ejaculated inside his victim. I regard that as a serious aspect of this crime. I would regard the crime as falling at the lowest end of the middle of the range, or at the top end of the lower range of seriousness for these kinds of crimes. 

17Mr Nash drew my attention to his client's intellectual disability and the diagnosis. I take into account that that means that general deterrence has a less significant role to play in the factors which I take into account in imposing the sentence. I do not accept that his impairment contributed to the offence. I do not regard there being sufficient evidence for me to reach that conclusion. 

18His plea of guilty is consistent with some remorse and he shows some willingness to rehabilitate himself. The letter to me also demonstrates some remorse. It is not as strong as it would be if he went into the witness box and I was able to see and hear him express his remorse, nevertheless it does constitute limited evidence of remorse. 

19Mr Nash addressed me on the commencement date of his client's sentence, because of the period of some 11½ months which his client had spent under sentence, whilst at the same time bail refused for this case. On one view that period of time should not be counted at all in my reckoning of this sentence which I impose. The sentence I impose obviously should be back-dated to take into account time which he has spent in custody on this offence alone. 

20Mr Nash argued however that I should make some allowance for the time which his client spent under sentence for the driving offences. He argued that, as a matter of totality, there is some risk of his client, who is still under 30, becoming institutionalised because of the lengthy periods of time which he has spent in custody. I accept Mr Nash's argument and will make an allowance for about half of that time which he has spent in custody. I will also count the whole of the period of the previous sentence. 

21Mr Nash argued that the sentence which I impose can have a non-parole period which would be less than the statutory 75 per cent of the full sentence. He said there are special circumstances which would warrant me reducing the non-parole period. His client needs to build up support in the community and has a psychological problem which needs to be dealt with. He is without his partner and will face challenges because of his intellectual disability and his personality disorder. He has drug problems which need to be dealt with. Mr Modder acknowledged that the psychological evidence did form a basis for there being special circumstances for such an adjustment.

22The victim of this offence was herself under a disability and I take that into account as a factor relevant to sentencing Mr Gibbs. He also has a previous criminal record although, as Mr Nash pointed out, he has not had convictions for crimes such as this before. He has convictions for very serious crimes involving personal violence. I regard that as an aggravating feature under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

23Mr Modder also pointed to the significance, amongst the many other factors which I need to take into account, of the standard non-parole period fixed by Parliament. He pointed out that it was a matter for my discretion as to back-dating the sentence, but submitted that I need to take into account that serving time which is concurrent obviously reduces the effect of any particular sentence. 

24Taking these factors into account, I would regard an appropriate sentence to impose as one of 5 years imprisonment. However, because Mr Christopher Gibbs pleaded guilty when he did, I would discount that by 20 per cent, so that the sentence which I will fix is 4 years imprisonment. The non-parole period which the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act would regard as appropriate for a 4 year sentence is 3 years imprisonment. Because of the special circumstances which I have referred to, I am going to reduce that from 3 years. Mr Nash suggested that an appropriate non-parole period might be on either side of 2 years. I regard that as a little too low, particularly given that Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period of 7 years to this crime. I propose to fix a non-parole period of 2½ years. That represents just over 60 per cent of the overall sentence of 4 years, when 75 per cent would be a 3 year non-parole period. So the non-parole period which I will fix is 2½ years. I am going to sentence you now Christopher Gibbs. 

25In respect of this crime, first I convict you of the offence of sexual intercourse without consent. I fix a non-parole period of 2½ years, which commenced on 1 December 2011 and will expire on 31 May 2014. The balance of the term is 1 year and 6 months which commenced on 1 June 2014 and will expire on 30 November 2015. The first date on which you are eligible for parole will be 31 May 2014, just over 1 year from now. Have a seat Mr Gibbs.

HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Nash, Mr Modder, the mathematics first. Take your time, there is no rush. It's better than having to come back and correct. And secondly, any matters of law or fact which perhaps I could fix under s 43 if needed - if there are things which I have overlooked or misstated so when you are ready let me know.
NASH: There is nothing from my part your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: And the sums are correct?
NASH: Yes your Honour the best I can tell.
HIS HONOUR: Yes.
MODDER: Yes the maths look okay to me your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Thanks Mr Modder. Christopher Gibbs I have given you a 4 year sentence for this crime which you committed against this woman. It would have been a 5 year sentence, but because you pleaded guilty once the prosecution dropped the charge to the less serious one, I have discounted that by 20 per cent so it goes from 5 years to 4 years. That is your sentence, 4 years. I fixed a non-parole period of 2½. Parliament says normally the non-parole period should be 3 years, but in your case I have reduced it to 2½ years. I back-dated the sentence so it commenced on 1 December 2011. In fact I could have back-dated it less than that, and made it start so that you would be spending more time in gaol. But I back-dated it in accordance with Mr Nash's argument to 1 November 2011. That means your non-parole period of 2½ years expires on - sorry 1 December 2011 is when it starts. Your non-parole period expires 31 May 2014, just over 1 year from now. That is the first date that you will be eligible for parole. Whether you get parole or not, as you probably know, does not depend upon me, it depends on the Parole Authority.
Okay now do you understand all that?
OFFENDER: I do.
HIS HONOUR: You do, all right. Well good luck, okay.

		11 October 2013",2013-05-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761504,R v Hickman [2013] NSWDC 143,"Judgment

1Kelvin John Hickman stands for sentence as a consequence of pleading guilty to four very serious offences which he committed on 16 August 2012. He asks me to take into account, in passing sentence, two matters on a Form 1 in respect of one of the four serious offences, what I will refer to shortly as the sequence 2 offence, using an offensive weapon with intent to intimidate. In addition, the offender asks me to deal with him for a breach of four s 9 bonds imposed upon him by the Local Court at Sutherland on 20 October 2011. I shall do so. Although the offences of 16 August 2012 are very serious, it is also important to bear in mind the circumstances of the earlier offences because they shed some light on the offender's conduct on 16 August 2012.

2The first of the four earlier offences occurred on 20 October 2010 in Torres Street, Kurnell. The offender was then living, and lived at all material times, at 128 Torres Street, Kurnell. The offence in question was common assault upon Mr John Eastern. Mr Eastern was a builder who was doing work at the house of a neighbour of the offender, Ms Lisa Mansfield. At about 9.10am on 20 October 2010, the offender was out the front of his house but was very upset. He was shouting out loudly about one of his neighbours, who had parked his vehicle in front of the offender's residence making it difficult for the Sutherland Shire Council garbage truck to pick up rubbish from the offender's residence. According to the offender, there was an ongoing issue between that neighbour and him about that neighbour's continually parking his vehicle in front of the offender's residence. Essentially, Ms Mansfield asked the offender to calm down. The offender had threatened, by his actions, to smash a garbage bin into the vehicle that was parked by that third neighbour. There was much shouting including the shouting of obscenities. Mr Eastern thought that there was some threat to Ms Mansfield. Mr Eastern asked for the offender to stop yelling at Ms Mansfield. The offender explained to Mr Eastern that he was not upset with Ms Mansfield but with the other neighbour. The offender told Mr Eastern, ""I am going to get my gun and shoot them"", the pronoun ""them"" referring to the neighbour or neighbours who had parked the car in front of his house. There was then further shouting and screaming using obscenities. 

3The offender left but came back holding a metal pole that was about one metre in length. The offender was yelling at Mr Eastern whilst holding the metal pole. They were only three metres apart. The offender invited the victim, Mr Eastern, to ""Come over here and I will sort you out."" Mr Eastern then laughed, which caused the offender to again swear and shout. The offender then threatened to go inside to get his shotgun and threatened to shoot Mr Eastern. The offender then went back into his residence and Mr Eastern returned to Ms Mansfield's property. 

4Ms Mansfield was aware that there were firearms at the offender's residence and became fearful that the offender might carry out the threat that he had made to Mr Eastern. She told the victim about that and reported the matter to the police. 

5At about 1.40pm police attended at the offender's address and arrested and eventually charged the offender. There was no actual striking of the victim or any actual harm caused to the victim; it was a common assault without any battery. The offender was sentenced to enter into a bond pursuant to s 9 for twelve months, which was imposed by the Local Court at Bankstown on 15 November 2010. However, the offender breached that bond and for that he was dealt with at the Local Court at Sutherland on 20 October 2011. 

6On 26 July 2011, the offender was driving westward in the middle lane of the westbound lanes of the Kingsway, Woolooware, approaching its intersection with Gannons Road. That intersection is controlled by traffic lights. In front of the offender, a gold Nissan Pulsar vehicle was being driven by Ms Beverly Tully. She slowed down, as did other traffic in the lane, as it approached the intersection of Gannons Road. However, the offender failed to brake safely and collided with the rear of Ms Tully's vehicle, causing damage. Both Ms Tully and the offender pulled to the left of the carriageway and got out of their vehicles. There was then a short exchange between Ms Tully and the offender, in which the offender refused to acknowledge that he was responsible for the accident and refused to wait for the arrival of the police. He also failed to give his details to Ms Tully.

7The police were called and eventually saw the offender in his vehicle turning into the car park of the Sutherland Hospital, which is on the corner of the Kingsway and Kareena Road, Caringbah. The police breath tested the offender and he eventually returned a mid-range prescribed concentration of alcohol in his breath. The reading was 0.113 grams of alcohol in 210 millilitres of breath. The offender was then charged with a mid-range PCA offence. 

8Later in the day he returned to his home at Kurnell where he resided with his elderly father, Mr Sydney Hickman. On that afternoon the offender committed a common assault upon his father and also intimidated him. The interaction between the offender and his father started essentially with the offender's accusing his father of ""dobbing him in"" to the police. The interaction earlier in the day with the police was because of a minor motor vehicle accident reported to the police by Ms Tully. The offender's father had nothing to do with the offender's interaction with the police earlier on that day. In other words, one can see in the commencement of the interaction between the offender and his father on 26 July 2011 some paranoid ideation. 

9After accusing his father of dobbing him into the police, the offender told his father that he was going to demonstrate what he would do to the policeman who had arrested him. He had in his hand a thirty-centimetre kitchen knife. He lunged towards his father, perhaps only to imitate what he intended to do to the policeman who had arrested him. However, his father was unsure of the offender's intention and did not know whether he was trying to stab him or scare him, but the offender's father did not turn his mind to the question of whether he was merely demonstrating what he might do to the policeman.

10A short time later, however, the offender threatened his father by holding a spear gun about fifteen centimetres away from his father's head. He said to his father, ""That's what I'll use if anyone comes here."" Again, that indicates paranoid ideation. The victim, that is the offender's father, feared for his safety as he did not know whether the spear gun was loaded or not. The offender later told police the spear gun was not loaded as the rubber which propels the spear out of the gun was not on the gun itself. 

11A short time later the offender walked around his house but with a metal bar about fifty centimetres long and about twenty millimetres thick in his hand. The offender told his father, ""I can give you one hit with this and it could kill you."" That clearly greatly alarmed the offender's father, who went immediately outside and called for neighbours to call the police. 

12Again, outside the house later that day, there was an allegation made by the offender that his father had dobbed him in to the police. That led to the offender's being charged with a common assault upon his father, although there was no actual battery, and a charge of stalking or intimidating intending to cause of physical or mental harm.

13Those three offences as well as the breach of the earlier s 9 bond were dealt with by the Local Court at Sutherland on 20 October 2011. In respect of the breach of the s 9 bond imposed by the Local Court at Bankstown on 15 December 2011, the Local Court at Sutherland imposed a further s 9 bond, again for twelve months, with the same supervision as had previously been imposed by the Local Court at Bankstown. In respect of the three fresh offences, the Local Court at Sutherland imposed in respect of each offence a s 9 bond for two years with supervision.

14Clearly, when the offender committed the major offences on 16 August 2012 he was bound by each of those s 9 bonds, that is, all four bonds imposed by the Local Court at Sutherland on 20 October 2011 to be of good behaviour.

15During the course of submissions I outlined to both the solicitor for the prosecution and the solicitor for the defence that I proposed to impose short custodial periods in respect of the breaches of those bonds, and there was no submission put to me by either solicitor to suggest that I should do otherwise.

16In respect of the offence of 20 October 2010, I intend to impose a fixed period of imprisonment of two months and in respect of each of the offences committed on 26 July 2011, I intend to impose a period of imprisonment of two months, each of the sentences in respect of the offences on 26 July 2011 to be served concurrently, in the way that the Local Court at Sutherland had dealt with them.

17I now turn to the principal offences and the Form 1 offences which the offender asks me to take into account.

18The offender is currently fifty-four years old. At the time of the offences he was fifty-three years old and was, as I have earlier stated, living with his father, Sydney Hickman, at 128 Torres Street, Kurnell. The offender's father was then eighty-seven years old. As a result of the interaction between the offender and his father on 26 July 2011 there was in force in favour of the offender's father an apprehended violence order.

19At about 5am on Thursday 16 August, Mr Sydney Hickman rose from his bed. The offender was already awake and in the living room watching television. There was then an argument between the offender and his father. The offender threatened his father saying something about his having an accident at home, like a gun going off, and the offender told his father that he would make it look like an accident. The offender and his father had for many years been keen sports shooters. Mr Sydney Hickman was a holder of a permit to possess firearms but the offender was not so licensed. There were firearms in the premises at 128 Torres Street, Kurnell. The threat made by the offender to his father caused the offender's father to leave the house and he went to the home of his general practitioner and friend, Dr Peter Calverley, who resided in Captain Cook Drive, Kurnell. Dr Calverley had also previously treated the offender. Dr Calverley phoned the police and reported what had happened.

20At about 5.40am the offender phoned his sister, Ms Debra Newans. She was living with her family at Menai. The offender told his sister that his father and the dog had gone missing. He said to his sister, ""He is putting the bolts in different places"" and ""people must be breaking in and moving everything ... the bolts, I find them in mum's drawers."" The offender's mother, the wife of his father, had died around 2000. Again, the suggestion by the offender to his sister that people were breaking into the house indicates some form of paranoid ideation.

21Shortly before 6am the first police arrived at Kurnell and spoke to Mr Sydney Hickman. They then made their way to the Hickman residence in Torres Street. The offender walked out of the premises and approached a vehicle that was parked in the front yard. That vehicle would appear to belong either the offender or his father. Police challenged the offender, but he want inside his premises. More police cars then arrived containing more police personnel. The offender was then seen to approach a window of the house at its front on the eastern side and remove a piece of Masonite covering the window. The offender was clearly inside the house at that time. Police observed that the offender was armed with a firearm and negotiations then commenced, led by Sergeant Jason Clarke. On several occasions Sergeant Clarke asked the offender to show him his hands to confirm that he was no longer armed. The offender complied with that request, but then again took possession of a firearm. Whilst the sergeant and the offender were talking, the offender was rambling in his speech and yelling things such as he wanted to see his father and his dog. The offender then threatened to shoot both himself and the police. 

22At about 7.30am the offender again spoke with his sister on the telephone. The offender told his sister that the police were at the house, and his sister advised him to go outside of the house carrying nothing in his hands. The offender then said these words to his sister:

""They are going to shoot me. I was at my car and they turned up and I told them to shoot me in the back. I've got the gun and I'm using and I'm going to blow my head off. I will get them before they get me. "" 

The offender's sister then contacted the police, who told her not to telephone the offender's house again. One must see in what the offender told his sister some paranoid ideation. He believed that the police were going to shoot him. There is no suggestion that any threat was made by the police to the offender.

23Two constables, Constables Kelly and Gallina, took up a position next to a large tree outside number 130 Torres Street, the house next door on its western side. Sergeant Clarke continued to try to negotiate with the offender, who became more agitated and threatened to shoot anyone who came in his house. The offender then left the house and appeared in the front yard carrying a firearm with a muzzle pointed towards the sky. The offender then positioned the firearm with the butt against his shoulder and aimed the firearm directly at Constable Gallina. Sergeant Clarke ordered his officers to take cover and both Constable Gallina and Constable Kelly ran to a car parked on the street. The offender then returned to the interior of the house. 

24The aiming of the firearm at Constable Gallina is the sequence 7 offence, the offence of using an offensive weapon with intent to intimidate contrary to the provisions of s 33B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. That offence carries a maximum penalty of twelve years imprisonment. 

25There was a subsequent similar offence. In R v Mostyn (2004) 145 A Crim R 304, Howie J said at [187] the following about offences under s 33B:

""It was clearly a serious example of the offence notwithstanding that the firearm had not been discharged. The officer was obviously not aware of that fact and the rifle was pointed at him for a significant period. The officer was placed in the highly stressful position of being confronted with the possibility of having to shoot the appellant in order to defend himself from what he perceived as a real and present danger to himself. It must be every police officer's nightmare that he or she will attend a domestic disturbance and find one of the occupants brandishing a firearm in his or her direction. Persons who put police officers in that position must expect the courts to react with severe sentences.""

Here, the firearm could be discharged and was subsequently discharged. When discharged it did not strike anybody. However, one can appreciate the alarm and fear that having a firearm pointed at him must have agitated in Constable Gallina's mind.

26After that offence the Tactical Operations Unit and official police negotiators arrived at the scene. 

27At about 8.10am the offender discharged the long barrelled shotgun from the front left window of the premises. The shot was fired in the air to the left of where the Tactical Operations Unit armoured vehicle had been parked. After discharging the firearm the offender retired further inside the house and shouted out, ""Sorry, that was an accident."" Police said to the offender, ""That is okay. Just put the gun down and come out with your hands up."" However, the offender did not comply with that request. A few minutes later he brandished the shotgun from the same window. Again the police yelled instructions to the offender to drop the gun. He then fired a second shot over the top of the police armoured vehicle. After he did that he again retreated further within the house. 

28During this siege neighbours on each side of the offender's house and his neighbours across the road were at home and witnessed the events. The second shot was captured on a DVD recording made by Mr Jason Orchard, who resides opposite the offender's house. Clearly that neighbour and members of his family were alarmed by what was occurring in their residential street.

29Some time after that a muffled gunshot was heard from inside the offender's house. After that he was not seen or heard for some time. That led police to believe that the offender may have indeed shot himself.

30Leading Senior Constable Mark Davidson from the Tactical Operations Unit moved out from behind the police armoured vehicle and crouched in a position near the fence which divides the offender's residence from the residence to its east. Leading Senior Constable Davidson attempted to use the magnified riflescope to look inside the premises to assess the offender's condition. The offender then appeared at the window. Another officer, positioned near the armoured vehicle, heard the offender say, ""You're fucking joking, aren't you? I've shot kangaroos further away than you are"". The words heard by Leading Senior Constable Davidson were an insult in offensive language and a threat to go to get a bigger gun. He then retired further inside the residence before again appearing at the window with a shotgun. The offender pointed the shotgun out the window and aimed the barrel at Leading Senior Constable Davidson. That is a second offence contrary to s 33B(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. 

31The only thing which might distinguish this offence from the earlier offence contrary to the same provision is that Leading Senior Constable Davidson had his rifle with him and was wearing armour protection, and was a member of a specialised squad dealing with persons in the position of the present offender, whereas Constable Gallina was only a general duties police officer. In other words, this offence differs from the earlier offence contrary to the same provision in that Leading Senior Constable Davidson was a little more protected and probably more used to the position in which he found himself.

32This caused Leading Senior Constable Davidson to fire one round at the offender. Constable Foster, who was seated in the turret of the armoured vehicle, discharged two rounds at the offender. The offender immediately fell back inside the window. Several minutes later, police heard the offender talking, but also groaning, inside the house. Police continued to attempt to communicate with the offender. Those attempts persisted for an hour. 

33At 9.30am the offender was heard to be slurring his speech and moving very slowly. Ambulance officers who had been called to the scene expressed concern for the offender's health and police discussed strategies to enable them to monitor the offender's health. At about 10.20am the offender appeared at the window again and showed police his wounded bloodied hands. Members of the Tactical Operations Unit entered the house at approximately 10.24am and the offender was arrested. He was then conveyed to St George Hospital but was subsequently transferred to Sydney Hospital for urgent surgery to his hands. It would appear from other evidence that I have read that the offender was subsequently transferred to St Vincent's Hospital before being transferred to the Corrective Services Hospital at Long Bay Gaol. Whilst in any of those hospitals the offender was under police guard.

34As a result of a wound to each hand, the offender needed to have the little and ring fingers of each hand amputated. The inference I drew from reading the facts in the medical evidence is that Constable Foster, who was seated in the turret of the armoured vehicle and had discharged two rounds, probably caused the damage to the offender's hands. The round discharged by Leading Senior Constable Davidson appears to have entered and left the offender's right upper arm. Surgery practised on the offender's right upper arm disclosed an entry and an exit wound containing a small piece of shrapnel which was extricated from the wound, which was debrided, washed and closed and appears to have left no sequela. 

35The interaction of the offender and his father commencing at 5am on the morning of that day was an offence of contravening the apprehended violence order, which is one of the offences the offender asks me to take into account when sentencing him for the sequence 2 offence, the offence involving Leading Senior Constable Davidson.

36After arresting the offender the police obtained a crime scene warrant for the offender's premises. They recovered a shotgun from inside the front left lounge room window, which had been used by the offender during these offences. It was a twelve gauge, AYA manufactured, single shot, break open shotgun. Examination of the shotgun revealed that it was not loaded, but contained one fired cartridge case in its chamber. The offender did not hold a firearms licence and the shotgun was not registered. The possession of that firearm is an offence contrary to s 7A(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 and carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. That is one of the substantial offences the offender asks me to take into account.

37Also at the time of the execution of the crime scene warrant, police found a gun belt containing shotgun ammunition which had been worn by the offender around his waist and a large number of shotgun rounds which had been contained in the left-hand tracksuit pocket of the clothing worn by the offender. The possession of that ammunition without a license or permit is an offence against the Firearms Act 1996, which the offender asks me to take into account on the Form 1. The maximum penalty for that offence is merely a fine of up to fifty penalty units. The two discharges of the firearm were offences contrary to s 93G(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment.

38In R v Cicekdag (2004) 150 A Crim R 299, Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) said at 35:

""... The problem with a projectile weapon, such as a firearm, is that once the projectile has been released it will travel a considerable distance and the firer has no control over its ultimate destination. Death or injury can result. This is particularly so where the discharge is indiscriminate in a public place and, as happened here, a number of shots are fired"".

Whilst it is clear that the offender did not discharge the two rounds at any particular person or thing, his action was reckless. One does not know where the shots may have ended up. In the same case, his Honour pointed out that, where more than one shot has been filed, principles of deterrence are of considerable importance. 

39It has been submitted, very properly in my view, that this was an offence in disregard of public safety, an aggravating factor referred to in s 21A(2)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The discharge, in the circumstances where the crime admitted was not a crime in disregard of public safety, is a matter that the Court is required to take into account. The two offences contrary to s 33B were against police officers exercising public functions, and the offence arose because of each of the victim's occupation. That is an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(a). In respect of each of the four principal offences, and indeed the two offences which the offender asks me to take into account on the Form 1, he was at conditional liberty at the time and such is always an aggravating factor, both pursuant to the Statute and at common law.

40Looking at the offences committed, that is, the four principal offences, but leaving aside entirely the subjective matters of the offender and in particular leaving aside his psychological and intellectual disabilities, the facts of each of the offences could be seen as in the mid-range. The Crown submitted that the objective seriousness of each offence was high, but based mainly on the subjective features. The defence submitted that they were beneath the mid-range of seriousness. Ultimately, I must look at not only the facts but the offender's personal circumstances and the background to these offences to determine their seriousness in considering the whole gamut of criminality.

41The offender himself has little recollection of these offences. The medical evidence before me to some extent explains why. I have been provided with two fairly comprehensive medical assessments of the offender. The first is from Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist who examined the offender on 25 October 2012 and wrote a report bearing date 12 April 2013. The second is an assessment from a consultant forensic psychologist, Mr Peter Ashkar, who interviewed the offender for three hours from 27 April 2013 and reported on 10 May 2013. There is no inconsistency of any note in either of the histories recorded or the opinions expressed by those two practitioners.

42The offender was identified as having learning problems when he started school, and needed to repeat ""year 1"". I take that piece of history from Dr Nielssen's report. It is not clear to me whether he was referring to first class as Year One used to be called, or to Form 1 as Year Seven used to be called. As I read the report in total, however, he appears to be referring to what is currently called Year One, the old first class. 

43The offender was never able to learn or to spell properly. When he went to Woolooware High School he was placed in a special class. He left high school at the end of ""second year"", meaning what we now call Year Eight. He did that to work with his father as a painter. The offender had taken so many days off school that the school authorities had approached his father to find out why he was not attending school, and the offender's father told them that he was not learning anything and was better off working. The offender worked with his father as a painter until he was either eighteen or nineteen and then worked as a builders' labourer ""on and off"" during his twenties. In his thirties the offender was granted a disability support pension because of the effects of substance abuse and hepatitis.

44Dr Nielssen estimated the offender's premorbid intelligence to be in the lower half of the normal range, based on his history of a learning disorder at school and the offender's report of his functioning in society and at work.

45Dr Ashkar made this assessment:

""Mr Hickman's overall level of intellectual functioning was estimated to fall at or below 'low average' levels on the basis of his educational and vocational history, and his current performance on test of intellectual functioning were consistent with this estimate. His overall level of intellectual functioning was 'borderline impaired' at the 3rd percentile (i.e. the bottom 3% of the population)"".

Accordingly, it can be seen that the offender is hardly intellectually well endowed and poorly educated and his achievement at work has not been great. 

46To compound the learning problems, the offender took up illicit drugs at a very early age. He began smoking cannabis at the age of twelve and has smoked that drug most days since his mid-adolescence. In fact, he appears to have last taken cannabis on the morning of 16 August 2012. In addition, as a teenager the offender inhaled lighter fluid and glue, took LSD and magic mushrooms and abused mandrax. He began inhaling heroin at the age of sixteen and within three months of using that drug was injecting daily. At the age of eighteen the offender stopped using heroin after enrolling in a short term methadone program but soon relapsed and used heroin on and off until the age of thirty three. Since then he has been using methadone. He has also been abusing benzodiazepine medication since his twenties to help overcome heroin withdrawal. 

47The one inconsistency I have between the reports taken by Dr Nielssen and Dr Ashkar concerns alcohol. According to Dr Nielssen's history, the offender's alcohol intake had increased over the eight years preceding his offending, although Dr Ashkar has it as falling. According to Dr Ashkar's substance use history, the offender starting taking prescribed benzodiazepine to manage anxiety in his mid-forties and has been using it on most days since that time as well as using illegally obtained benzodiazepine on occasions. Dr Nielssen diagnosed, in addition to substance dependence, an abuse disorder and a learning disorder, a psychotic illness. Dr Ashkar agrees with the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. Both gentlemen appear to accept that the offender's behaviour on 16 August 2012 was because of a substance induced psychosis. 

48Clearly, the psychosis involved paranoid ideation. The offender only admitted to paranoid ideation after he was admitted to hospital and treated for gunshot wounds but there is evidence, which I have tried to point out from the offender's earlier behaviour, of psychosis and supporting evidence from the offender's sister of long-standing paranoid behaviour.

49I accept that the offender's major reason for the commission of the offences on 16 August 2012 was because of a substance-induced psychosis. The offender told Dr Nielssen that when the police turned up in the front of his house his response to that situation was to take twenty tablets of Xanax and drink a quarter a bottle of Ouzo. The offender also admits to having smoked cannabis before police arrived. It appears, if that history be correct, that the taking of the Xanax and Ouzo could not explain the interaction of the offender and his father commencing at about 5am. The offender has little recollection of that interaction. It appears to me, therefore, it likely that the psychosis arose because of the substance abuse rather than from any ingestion of the Xanax and Ouzo after the police had arrived at the offender's premises. However, that would hardly assist the offender coping with his psychotic illness. Equally, his psychotic illness may have rendered the offender unable to realise the effect of taking the Xanax and the Ouzo.

50Of course, deliberate self-inducing, for example, intoxication, is hardly any excuse for criminal behaviour. However, here the psychosis resulted from the continual long-term drug abuse stemming back to the offender's adolescence, when he was twelve years old, either in Year Six or Year Seven. He was a twelve year old boy with very little intellectual ability and with certain disorders, who took, probably as a dare from his schoolmates, to try to smoke this weed and that has eventually led to addiction. 

51The offender's moral culpability for his addiction cannot be great bearing in mind his early taking up of the use of cannabis when he could hardly understand or foresee the long-term consequences of the addiction, which he precipitated by taking up the drug. The cannabis use led to heroin abuse and that made the substance abuse even worse. 

52The principles relating to those that are suffering from a mental illness or intellectual handicap or other mental problems are well known. Here, the offender has a mental illness, psychosis, and an intellectual handicap. In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (201) 79 NSWLR 1, McClellan CJ at CL said at [177]:

""Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing ... They can be summarised in the following manner:

Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence...

It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed...

It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or conditions under which it is served may be reduced...
It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence...

Conversely, it may be that because of a person's medical illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances consideration of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence ... Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public...

[178] I should stress that the mental health problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they will be relevant to the sentencing process. The circumstances may indicate that when an offender has a mental disorder of modest severity it may nevertheless be appropriate to moderate the need for general or specific deterrence...""

53I accept that because of the offender's mental handicap and psychiatric illness, this is hardly a case for promoting general deterrence. I also accept that the offender's moral culpability for his crimes has been reduced. In the current case, I can readily accept that the element of specific deterrence also is removed because the condition which has caused the problem has now been identified and is being treated, and furthermore the offender is hardly ever likely to use again a firearm given the physical injuries which he sustained as a result of being shot. The offender clearly has suffered from extra-curial punishment. The wounds led to the loss of two fingers on each hand and that represents a physical handicap that the offender must bear for the rest of his days. 

54In her submissions, the solicitor for the offender referred me to the mitigating factor provided by s 21A(3)(j), however that is merely the mitigating factor I have now discussed at some length based on ordinary Common Law principles. Both the offender's reduced moral culpability for his crimes, the fading away of the need for general and specific deterrence, and the extra-curial punishment mitigate the sentences which otherwise ought be passed upon the offender for the objective seriousness of the offences which he has committed. Having said that, the Court must have regard to all the principles of sentencing as set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which includes the need to protect the community from the offender, the rehabilitation of the offender and the need to make the offender accountable for his or her actions and to denounce the conduct of the offender.

55On the question of contrition and remorse, Dr Ashkar accorded the following:

""Mr Hickman could not account for his behaviour. He struggled to appreciate the perspective of the police and to express feelings of regret and remorse: 'I feel nothing [there is] nothing to feel. I'm a bit silly for doing it. I got shot out of it. I was lucky they didn't kill me. I should have just been gave up, put the gun down. [Q: Why didn't you?] No idea. Don't know. [Q: How do you feel about it now?] Pretty stupid. Then I wouldn't have got my hands shot off.'""

56If the offender manages to wean himself of substance abuse, stay away from cannabis, benzodiazepines - whether they are prescribed or not - and any other drug of addiction, and if he cooperates with the medical profession in controlling his psychotic illness, the prospects of re-offending are very low. If, however, the offender does not there could well be re-offending behaviour. This, in my view, raises a case of special circumstances to break the statutory nexus between the head sentence and the non-parole period. When released to the community the offender will need as much assistance as he can to stay on the straight and narrow after having learned to control his addiction to illicit drugs whilst in custody and having learned to control his medical condition by cooperating with medical practitioners. As much assistance for as long as possible whilst he is in the community would be the best thing for both the offender and the community.

57I should have stated at the commencement of these reasons but failed to do so that it is accepted that the offender pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and I accept the offender is entitled to a full discount of twenty five percent of the proper sentences to be passed on him for the utilitarian value of his pleas. However, I should point the case against the offender was very strong. 

58Statistics available from the Judicial Commission indicate that there have been forty-seven cases dealt with under s 33B(1)(a). The median head sentence is three years imprisonment and the median non-parole period is eighteen months imprisonment. At the top of the range the head sentence is four and a half years and the non-parole period is three years. For offences contrary to s 93G(1)(b) there have only been sixteen cases. Seventy-five percent of those have been dealt with by full-time custody. The median head sentence is thirty months imprisonment and median non-parole period is eighteen months. At the top of the range the head sentence is five years and the non-parole period is three and a half years. Only three persons have been dealt with for an offence against s 7A(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 by way of full-time non-consecutive custodial sentence. One offender was sentenced to a fixed term of six months imprisonment, two other offenders were sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment, one with a twelve-month non-parole period but the second also had an eighteen-month non-parole period meaning that it was a fixed term.

59For the offence against the Firearms Act I shall impose a fixed term of imprisonment of one year. 

For the first offence contrary to s 33B (sequence 7 offence) I shall impose a head sentence of three years with a non-parole period of two years. 

For the offence contrary to s 93G(1)(d) I intend to fix a head sentence of two years with a non-parole period of fifteen months. 

For the second offence contrary to s 33B I shall sentence the offender to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of nine months. 

With partial accumulation, which must occur in this case, the non-parole period will be three years and three months; the additional term will be two years and three months and the total sentence will be five years and six months. Those sentences are after the twenty-five percent discount.

Bearing in mind what I earlier said about the offences bringing the offender before the Court to call up for the breach of s 9 bonds, the offender all told will serve a period of three years and six months in custody and be on parole for a total period of two years and three months. 

No-one wants any further reasons, do they? At 4.50pm I have inquired with the solicitors for the parties whether any further reasons for sentence are required and I am told that none are required. 

For the offence of common assault committed at Kurnell against John Eastern on 20 October 2010, I revoke the s 9 bond imposed by the Local Court at Sutherland on 20 October 2011. I sentence you to imprisonment for one month, commencing on 16 August 2012 and expiring on 15 September 2012. 

For each of the offences committed on 26 July 2011, that is the driving with a mid-range prescribed concentration of alcohol at Caringbah on 26 July 2011, for intimidating Sydney Hickman with the intention of causing him to fear physical or mental harm at Kurnell on the same day, and for common assault of Sydney Hickman on the same day, I revoke each of the s 9 bonds imposed by the Local Court at Sutherland on 20 October 2011 in respect of those offences. I sentence you to imprisonment for two months. Each sentence is to be served concurrently. The period of imprisonment is from 16 September 2012 to 15 November 2012. 

On the charge that on 16 August 2012 at Kurnell you did possess a firearm, namely a single barrel shotgun, not being authorised to do so by licence or permit, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment for a fixed term of one year, commencing on 16 November 2012 and expiring on 15 November 2013. 

On the charge that on 16 August 2012 at Kurnell you did use an offensive weapon with intent to intimidate Constable Andrew Gallina by pointing the firearm directly at the said Constable Gallina, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years, commencing on 16 May 2013 and expiring on 15 May 2015. I impose a further term of imprisonment of one year, to commence upon the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring on 15 May 2016. The total sentence is therefore three years, comprising the non-parole period and the balance of the sentence. I have found special circumstances. 

For the offence that on 16 August 2012 at Kurnell you did fire a firearm, namely a single barrel shotgun, near a public place, namely Torres Street, Kurnell, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of fifteen months, commencing on 16 May 2014 and expiring on 15 August 2015. I impose a further period of imprisonment of nine months, to commence upon the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring on 15 May 2016. The total sentence is therefore two years, comprising the non-parole period and the balance of the sentence. I have found special circumstances. 

On the charge that on 16 August 2012 at Kurnell you did use an offensive weapon with intent to commit the indictable offence of intimidating Leading Senior Constable Mark Davidson, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of nine months, commencing on 16 May 2015 and expiring on 15 February 2016. I impose a further period of imprisonment of two years and three months, to commence at the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring on 15 May 2018. The total sentence is therefore three years, comprising a non-parole period and the balance of the sentence. I have found special circumstances. You are eligible to be considered for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period and that is on 15 February 2016. In passing that sentence I have taken into account the two matters on the Form 1. 

Again I point out, Mr Hickman, that effectively you are being sentenced to imprisonment for three years and six months with an additional term of two years and three months, such that you be eligible for release to parole on 15 February 2016 and will be under the Probation and Parole Service for two years and three months provided the Parole Board admits you to parole. Do you understand?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Now, ladies, my Associate and I spent some considerable time working out the mathematics on this. Do you want to have a look at this?

BURGOYNE: Yes, your Honour. Your Honour, you may be one, literally one day out. With the call-up, the first - the common assault, if I'm correct, your Honour - is sentenced to one month commencing 16 August 2012 expiring 15 September.

HIS HONOUR: Expiring 15 September.

BURGOYNE: The three remaining sentenced to two months commencing 15 September and I think your Honour said expiring 15 November.

HIS HONOUR: No, they start the 16th, 16 September and expire 15 November. The next sentence starts on 16 November. 

BURGOYNE: Thank you.

2761506,Abounader v R [2013] NSWCCA 106,"Judgment

1THE COURT: The applicant, Farres Abounader seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed by R A Hulme J following his plea of guilty to a charge of riot contrary to s 93 (1) (b) Crimes Act 1900. His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for six years, commencing on 24 December 2009 and expiring on 23 December 2015 and set a non-parole period of four years, expiring on 23 December 2013. 

The Facts

2The charge arose out of the part played by the applicant in hostilities that broke out between rival motorcycle clubs at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport on 22 March 2009. During the hostilities Anthony Zervas, the brother of a member of the Hell's Angels Outlaw Motorcycle Group (Hell's Angels), was killed. This summary of the facts is taken from his Honour's remarks on sentence.

7 I have received a set of agreed facts as to what occurred at the airport on 22 March 2009 and the offender's role in it. What I am about to say about the offence is largely drawn from the agreed facts but it is supplemented by some references to the evidence in the trial and some factual findings I have made based upon it. These are confined to matters that, whilst not adverse to the offender, provide additional clarity and context.

8 It is included in the agreed facts, and it was common ground at the trial, that there was ongoing hostility between the Comancheros and the Hell's Angels and the offender was aware of this.

9 The Comancheros were headed by a national president, Mahmoud Hawi, who had absolute power. It was a club which had a hierarchical structure, underpinned by strict and enforceable rules. These rules governed the behaviour expected from members and reinforced a strong culture of loyalty of members towards one another and to the club. Such rules included that any display of cowardice would not be tolerated.

10 At the time of the offence the offender held the office of ""road captain"" within the Comancheros. It is stated in the agreed facts that his duties in this position ""included organising road trips"". The use of the word ""included"" implies there were other duties as well but the nature of them is not disclosed.

11 On Sunday, 22 March 2009 Hawi, along with Christian Menzies, Ishmail Eken, Pomare Pirini and Maher Aouli, all members of the Comancheros, were flying from Melbourne to Sydney on Qantas flight 430. They departed Melbourne at about midday and were due to arrive in Sydney at about 1.30pm.

12 Derek Wainohu, the president of the Hell's Angels, happened to be on the same flight and was seen by the Comanchero members. Passengers observed them to exhibit animosity towards him. Hawi glared and gestured as he walked up and down the plane past Wainohu a number of times. He directed Aouli to contact other members in Sydney, including the offender, in order to have them attend the airport. Wainohu sent text messages to members of his gang for the same purpose.

13 Telephone records show that after he was telephoned by Aouli, the offender contacted eight other Comanchero members. He then drove his car to the airport with Tiago Costa and Francesco La Rosa as passengers. Another Comanchero member, SP, drove Usama Potrus' mother's car with Potrus, AL and Zoran Kisacanin as passengers. (Publication of the names of SP and AL has been suppressed.) The two cars with their seven occupants first proceeded to a meeting with senior club members (the Commander and the Sergeant at Arms) at Brighton-le-Sands before going to the airport.

14 The seven Comancheros who came to the airport did so under the obvious impression that their attendance was required as a matter of urgency. On arrival the cars were parked illegally directly outside the lower, baggage claim, level. All the occupants alighted and entered the building. They immediately went via escalators at the eastern end of the terminal to the upper, departure hall, level where they walked in front of the check-in counters towards the security checkpoint at the western end.

15 With the exception of the offender, the Comancheros passed through the security screening area at the western end of the terminal and proceeded to Gate 5 where QF430 was due. The offender was seen on security camera footage signalling to the other Comanchero members and tapping his pocket. Potrus returned to wait with the offender outside the security screening area in the departure hall. The offender did not go through the screening area as he had a knife with him and believed that it would be detected by the walk-through metal detectors.

16 Seven Hell's Angels members or associates also came to the airport: Peter and Anthony Zervas, Musa Ovalle, David Padovan, Tom Baker, Peter Martin and Elias Khoury. Baker and Padovan went through to Gate 5 via the security screening point in the centre of the terminal. The remaining five men waited in the departure hall.

The Affray at Gate 5

17 An affray occurred in the immediate vicinity of Gate 5. Neither Potrus nor the offender were present and it is unnecessary to go into great detail. Suffice to say, there was a verbal confrontation between Hawi and Wainohu after they had disembarked. Wainohu and Baker were punched to the ground and Comanchero members were punching and kicking Padovan. At the end of the affray, Hawi yelled threats to the retreating Hell's Angels. None of the participants received serious injuries but members of the public were put in fear.

18 The Comanchero members (those who had disembarked from the flight and those who had driven to the airport and gone through to Gate 5) walked as a group out of the sterile area and emerged into western end of the departure hall through a set of 'one-way' bi-fold doors.

19 On their way out of the sterile area Aouli is visible on security camera footage making a mobile telephone call. Telephone records established that it was a call made to Potrus. Aouli informed him of the affray that had just occurred at Gate 5. It is agreed that news of the affray was passed on by Potrus to the offender.


The confrontation in the departure hall

20 The offender and Potrus joined the other Comanchero members as they emerged into the departure hall. The offender and Potrus had been waiting in an area near the security screening point at the top of the escalators that led downstairs to the baggage collection area and exit. But instead of going downstairs to collect their checked baggage, the group of now 12 Comancheros moved quickly towards the five Hell's Angels who were milling about in the centre aisle of the departure hall between the business class and economy class check-in counters.

21 There was an issue in the trial as to why the Comancheros walked in this direction. Were they aware of the presence of the Hell's Angels? Were they intent on confronting them? It was contended on behalf of the Comancheros that they were simply heading towards the escalators at the eastern end of the terminal that had been used earlier by the seven who had come to the airport in order to go downstairs to the cars and leave the airport. I indicated when sentencing Eken and Potrus that this claim had no credibility. If they were in a hurry to get out of the terminal as they claimed, why would they walk towards some escalators that were at the opposite end of the terminal, about 140 metres away, when there were escalators almost immediately adjacent to the bi-fold doors? I observed that it seemed highly likely that the Comancheros walked deliberately towards the waiting Hell's Angels; probably because Abounader and Potrus had become aware of their presence while they were waiting for the others to return from Gate 5:Rv Eken; R v Potrus [2012] NSWSC 2 at [21]-[22]. However, I also indicated that it was unnecessary to decide this issue and that what really was of significance was what occurred when the two groups came together.

22 If the Comancheros were not previously aware of the presence of the Hell's Angels, they obviously became aware of them as they walked increasingly quickly in their direction. The distance from where the other Comancheros met up with the offender and Potrus outside the bi-fold doors to check-in counters 13 and 14 where they confronted the Hell's Angels was approximately 73 metres.

23 It is an agreed fact that it was the intention of the Comancheros as they approached the Hell's Angels to confront them. Kisacanin peeled off and ran between the check-in counters, and then continued running east in an apparent attempt to approach the Hell's Angels from a different angle; something of a flanking manoeuvre.

24 The two groups came together behind the check-in counters. There was a short verbal argument between Hawi and Peter Zervas before the riot commenced. The deceased Anthony Zervas made a pre-emptive strike at Hawi with a pair of scissors, striking him near the ear. It was later determined that the deceased had a high level of illicit drugs in his system. Eyewitnesses describe the riot as then breaking out with both sides fighting each other and punches flying everywhere.

The riot moves in front of the check-in counters

25 As the riot continued, the participants fought their way through the counters to the area at the front of the terminal where passengers were queuing with their luggage.

26 The fighting that took place, although short-lived, was shockingly vicious. Eyewitnesses described the riot as being a ""massive brawl"", and an ""a// in brawl"" between two sides, with more men on one side than the other. One witness spoke of ""an explosion of fighting"".

27 Another witness said, ""They all started fighting as well and it was like a frenzy, they just went for it, the whole lot of them, and, you know, punching, throwing -just punching, kicking and then the bollards became involved ...It was just too horrendous"". A witness lining up at the check-in counters fell to the ground as her companion tried to pull her out of the way of the violence. She described the fighting as ""chaotic and quite wild and uncontrolled"", and that the men were ""raging, really angry. There was a lot of momentum, there was no - it would have been quite a hard fight to stop"".

28 The fighting generally involved wrestling, punching and kicking. However, some of the participants picked up bollards to use as weapons. A witness said that he ""saw the metal bollards being thrown through the air and smashed on to people"". A Qantas staff member said that the fighting men ""fell into the crowd; people went flying, screaming; and the bollards were flying"".

29 The deceased was pursued to the glass wall at the front of the terminal where he went to the ground. He was bludgeoned with a bollard causing severe head injuries and also suffered three stab wounds to his chest and abdomen. It was an agreed fact in these proceedings that the stab wounds were likely inflicted by a pair of scissors. The Crown has accepted that the offender was at no stage involved in the attack on the deceased.

30 The riot lasted only about a minute. However it was extremely frightening and distressing for those present in the terminal. Many of the witnesses felt threatened and terrified. A mother travelling with two young children described being terrified. She said,""/ was absolutely frozen with fear, and I just held my child close for protection. I pulled the pram towards me and I prayed that one of those bollards didn't fly through the air and land on my child... my child was crying"". This witness was observed to be ""really distressed, yelling, crying"" and was given oxygen by paramedics.

31 Her husband described her as being ""really distressed, yelling, crying"". Another witness said that the mother was ""clearly... very distressed and looked quite shocked and she burst into tears"". This witness added, ""/ suppose I became distressed myself"". An elderly woman said that she had to turn away as she ""got too distressed because [she had] never experienced anything like this"". An elderly couple seated close to where the fatal assault took place was observed to have been in distress. One of the first police officers on the scene said that a number of the members ofthe public who were present ""appeared distressed and upset"".

3His Honour described the applicant's role as follows: 

The role of the offender

32 The offender was part of the group of Comancheros that was moving quickly towards the Hell's Angels in the departure hall. At this time he had formed a clear intention to confront the Hell's Angels.

33 The offender participated in the fighting as it moved through the check-in counters. He was described by a witness as trying to put another man in a head lock. She said, ""He was just trying to put this smaller gentleman in a head lock and trying to grab him"".

34 At one stage the offender attempted to take out the knife he had in his pocket but he accidentally cut his own hand, causing it to bleed extensively. He was not seen to brandish or threaten anyone with the knife.

35 The offender fled the terminal with SP, Costa and Potrus by running along the road to the carpark and taking the lift to the ground level where he and SP had parked the cars. A trail of his blood was found in the carpark and the lift.

36 A knife that was similar to the description of the offender's was later found in a drain outside the terminal.

4His Honour assessed the seriousness of the applicant's offence in these words:

Objective seriousness

37 I do not believe that the riot was planned or premeditated. Rather it was the result of three significant factors culminating on the day: the Comancheros' culture that prized loyalty and eschewed cowardice; the ongoing war with the Hell's Angels; and the chance encounter between Hawi and Wainohu on flight QF430 from Melbourne.

38 The first response of both sides to this chance meeting was to summon reinforcements to Sydney airport. This may not have been done with the specific intention that there would be a violent confrontation, but the number of Comancheros that were summoned and the urgency with which they arrived indicated that they were alive to that possibility.

39 That being said, once in the terminal, I am satisfied that it was the Comancheros who were the principal aggressors between the two groups. They were prepared to engage in violence at Gate 5 with their obvious advantage in numbers of 10 to 3 and they were prepared to continue with violence at an escalated level in the departure hall, where they initially outnumbered the Hell's Angels 12 to 5 (Wainohu, Baker and Padovan arrived in the departure hall after the riot had started).

40 Anthony Zervas' attack on Hawi was certainly foolish; Hawi was 178 cm tall with a heavy muscular build while Mr Zervas was 161 cm tall and weighed only 58 kg. But while that attack probably fuelled the aggression of at least some of the Comancheros, I am not persuaded that the riot was initiated by this attack. The fact is that violence was inevitable as the 12 Comancheros hurried towards the 5 Hell's Angels with the intention of confronting them. Anthony Zervas simply tried to make a pre-emptive strike.

41 A matter that is particularly relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the riot is the location in which it occurred. Despite being surrounded by members of public, and airline, airport and security staff, the participants were prepared to engage in vicious fighting across a wide area of the departure hall. The level of violence increased as bollards were picked up and used as weapons.

42 An airport terminal is a place where people are entitled to expect safety and security. But many witnesses were left distressed and fearful by the riot. There were elderly people and small children present. I have no doubt that the memory of it will live long in their minds.

43 In assessing the seriousness of the offence, I also have had regard to the offender's individual culpability for the violence of that day. It is an agreed fact that the offender did not take part in the attack on the deceased and I have excluded from my consideration any responsibility of the offender for the death of Mr Zervas.

44 Nonetheless, I am satisfied that the offender did play an organisational role in the violence that occurred that day. After he received the call for reinforcements from Aouli on the flight, he marshalled the other Commancheros before they all headed to the airport. He also stopped to consult other Comanchero office bearers on the way.

45 Further, the offender was armed with a knife. His decision not to pass through the security screening with the rest of the Comancheros and remain in the departure hall indicates that he was well aware that he was carrying a weapon and unwilling to part with it. Once the riot started he tried to pull out the knife. It was an agreed fact that he cut his hand on it and there were no witnesses who saw him brandish the knife or threaten anyone with it. But it remains that he did go for his knife and I can only infer that this was because he intended to use it during the riot.

46 A witness identified the offender fighting during the riot. He was described as trying to put another man in a headlock. His use of violence at least included physical fighting in this respect and it is an agreed fact that the offender was involved in the riot as it came through the check-in counters.

47 I am satisfied that the riot, and the offender's role in it, means that his offence is one of considerable objective seriousness.

The Applicant's Plea of Guilty

5The applicant's plea of guilty came about in the following way. He was arrested on 3 July 2009 and charged with riot. He was refused bail. He was charged with murder on 12 August 2009. He pleaded not guilty to both charges. He was committed for trial. 

6On 10 May 2011 Counsel for the applicant offered on his behalf that he would plead guilty to manslaughter if the Crown would accept the plea in discharge of the murder indictment. The offer was refused by the Crown Prosecutor. It seems from a file note written on the same day by the solicitor instructing the Crown Prosecutor that the solicitor for the applicant had already written to the Crown offering the plea of guilty and that the Crown had not accepted it. On making his offer, Counsel for the applicant asked whether it were necessary to put the offer in writing and the Crown Prosecutor said that there was no need. Both solicitors made file notes of the conversation. 

7The trial commenced on 24 May 2011 and on 2 November 2011 the jury found the applicant not guilty of murder. They were unable to agree on the alternative charge of manslaughter. No verdict was taken on an alternative charge of riot. 

8On 2 December 2011 an indictment charging manslaughter was presented and the applicant pleaded not guilty. His trial was fixed for 3 September 2012. He successfully applied for bail pending trial and entered it on 4 May 2012. On 24 August 2012 a further indictment was presented charging riot and the applicant pleaded guilty to that charge. The Crown abandoned the manslaughter charge.

Other offenders

9Fourteen persons other than the Applicant were charged with offences arising out of the hostilities. Those indicted for their conduct at Gate 5 were charged with affray. Those indicted for their conduct in the Departure Hall were charged variously with murder, manslaughter, riot and affray. Of those ultimately sentenced, Christian Menzies, Ishmail Eken, Usama Potrus and Zoran Kisacanin are important for this appeal. They were tried jointly with the applicant. 

10On 2 November 2011 Menzies was acquitted of murder and the jury were unable to agree on manslaughter. Menzies was found guilty of affray (Gate 5). On 2 December 2011 he pleaded guilty also of manslaughter (Departure Hall). He was sentenced for affray to a fixed term of three years and for manslaughter to a non-parole period of three years and eight months and a balance of term of three years and six months. The sentences were partly accumulated to produce an effective non-parole period of four years and two months and a balance of term of three years and six months.

11On 2 November 2011, Ishmail Eken and Usama Potrus were both acquitted of murder and manslaughter and found guilty of riot (Departure Hall). Each was sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and a balance of term of two years. 

12On 2 November 2011 Zoran Kisacanin was acquitted of murder and manslaughter and found guilty of affray (Gate 5) and riot (Departure Hall). He was given a fixed term of two years and two months for affray and a non-parole period of two years and eight months with a balance of term of two years and one month for riot. The sentences were accumulated to produce an effective non-parole period of three years and two months and balance of term of two years and one month.

13The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years, for riot imprisonment for 15 years and for affray imprisonment for 10 years.

The Grounds of Appeal

14The first ground of appeal asserts that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in light of the sentences imposed on his co-offenders, Eken, Potrus and Kisacanin. 

Eken and Potrus

15Potrus was not present at the affray at Gate 5. Eken was but was found not guilty of the affray there. They were dealt with for the events in the Departure Hall. In sentencing them his Honour said this about the events leading up to the confrontation in the Departure Hall- 

14 The affray, for which Mr Eken was acquitted, occurred in the immediate vicinity of Gate 5 after the arriving passengers disembarked. It is unnecessary to go into the detail of what occurred aside from saying that there was a fight involving three Hell's Angels, Wainohu, Baker and Padovan, and a number of the Comancheros. The fight commenced very shortly after Hawi and Wainohu came face to face after disembarking from the plane. The jury were satisfied of the involvement in the use, or threatened use, of violence by Hawi, Menzies and Kisacanin, given the verdicts of guilty of affray they returned in respect of them. SP and AL, Pirini, Aouli, La Rosa and Costa had earlier pleaded guilty to affray in respect of this incident. The Crown did not contend that Messrs Wainohu and Baker were aggressors. It did in respect of Mr Padovan, but he was acquitted. The submission by his counsel in his closing address to the jury that ""he was flogged"" by the Comancheros was, in my view, apt. 

15 It was Mr Eken's case that he played something of a peacemaker role during the affray at Gate 5. AL said that he heard someone say words to the effect, ""Not here, let's go outside"". There was evidence that SP had told a police officer in July 2009 that Mr Eken had settled things down and had said, ""Not in the airport"". Some of the eyewitnesses heard someone say ""Let's take it outside"" or the like. The Crown, on the other hand, submitted that if the jury accepted any of this evidence, they should consider that Mr Eken was not trying to discourage fighting; he was simply counselling the participants to do it elsewhere. 

16 There was evidence that at the conclusion of the events at Gate 5, Hawi pointed and uttered threats towards one or more of the Hell's Angels. One witness said that he heard, ""You're dead, you are fucking dead"". Another heard, ""You're a dead man, you're fucking dead, you've got bullet holes in you"". If the witnesses were able to hear these threats, Mr Eken must have as well. 

17 Whilst the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of Mr Eken's guilt in respect of the affray, and so he is to be regarded as innocent of that offence, the fact that he undoubtedly witnessed the violence at Gate 5 cannot be ignored. It must have been the freshest thing in his memory as he emerged, with his fellow gang members, into the departure hall. A feature of what he witnessed was the preparedness of at least some of his companions to use or threaten violence in a public place in front of many members of the public, including children. The accounts given by many of those who gave evidence about the affray made it abundantly clear that many were horrified and frightened. 

18 From the foregoing, I am satisfied of a number of matters that are worth recapping in order to put what next occurred in context. The Comancheros and Hell's Angels motorcycle gangs were, in effect, at war with each other. Mr Eken was a member of the Comancheros. He was subject to its strict rules requiring loyalty and prohibiting cowardice. There was a prospect, of which he was aware soon after boarding the flight in Melbourne, of a confrontation with one or more Hell's Angels upon arrival in Sydney. Given the history of hostility between the two gangs it was a reasonable possibility that such a confrontation would involve violence. On Hawi's command, he assisted in summoning reinforcements. A violent fight broke out between the Comancheros and the Hell's Angels soon after the flight landed. Mr Eken was a witness to this but did not participate and may have tried to encourage the participants not to fight in that particular location. After it had ended, it was apparent to him, and his companions, that their gang president was extremely displeased and had indicated that he wanted vengeance at the next opportunity, whenever that might be. 

19 Mr Potrus was a full Comanchero member as well. He had been summoned to attend the airport and he did so as a matter of urgency. He was made aware that fellow Comanchero members, including the national president, were arriving on a flight from Melbourne and that there was a prospect of Hell's Angels being present. Again, given the history of hostility, it must have been obvious that if any confrontation occurred, there could be violence. Mr Potrus did not witness what occurred at Gate 5 but he must have been made aware of it, at least in a general sense, very soon after. 


16In imposing sentence his Honour summarised Eken's conduct thus-

32 SP gave evidence of seeing Mr Eken involved in fighting in front of the check-in counters with Peter Zervas and another one of the Hell's Angels (T2623). It would seem that this fighting was confined to punching and wrestling; there is no suggestion that he was involved in using any implement as a weapon. SP said that Mr Eken was on the ground at some stage, having either fallen or been knocked down. This could have been in the area where his small brown bag was later found, between two of the check-in counters. In his closing address to the jury, Mr Young did not dispute that Mr Eken was involved in some fighting. His case was put in terms of him having only acted in self-defence - ""He was fighting someone off so he could get away"" (T4558) - a proposition rejected by the jury beyond reasonable doubt.

and Potrus's thus-

35 Mr Potrus lost his shoes during the riot: one was found between the check-in counters and he was seen on security camera footage to be carrying the other one. The witness with the two children described seeing three men passing in front of her, coming from the direction of where the deceased was lying on the ground. She said one of them had no shoes on. No-one else lost their shoes and so it is reasonable to infer that this was a description of Mr Potrus coming from somewhere near to where the fatal assault occurred. I note that the Crown did not suggest that Mr Potrus was directly involved in that assault. 

36 Potrus, Abounader, Costa and SP ran out of the terminal and, via a convoluted route, returned to the cars and made good their escape. Mr Potrus could be seen in security camera footage in the carpark lift carrying one of his shoes and wearing a singlet that was torn. He had clearly been involved in the fighting in some fashion. There was evidence from SP that he saw Mr Potrus fighting (T2622). In cross-examination he agreed that Mr Potrus had been hit and had fallen to the ground in the vicinity of where his shoe was later found. He also said that Mr Potrus had later complained of an injury to his jaw (T2909 - 2911). There was no medical evidence of any injury. The most there was on this topic was some vision of Mr Potrus rubbing his jaw when in the carpark lift. Mr Driels, counsel for Mr Potrus, as did other counsel, strongly challenged SP's honesty and reliability as a witness. It does not seem to me to be safe to act upon it unless independently confirmed. 

37 Mr Potrus' case was that he had simply gone to the airport to meet ""his friends"" and to take them home safely (T4506). If he was involved in any fighting, it was in self-defence. Clearly the jury rejected that case in relation to the riot charge. 


Kisacanin

17In sentencing Kisacanin his Honour described the affray at Gate 5 in terms similar to those extracted above and continued -

16 From the foregoing, I am satisfied of a number of matters that are worth recapping in order to put what next occurred in context. The Comancheros and Hell's Angels motorcycle gangs were, in effect, at war with each other. The offender was a nominee member of the Comancheros. He was subject to its strict rules requiring loyalty and prohibiting cowardice. 

17 I am satisfied that when he proceeded to the airport the offender was aware that there was a prospect of a confrontation with one or more Hell's Angels. Given the history of hostility between the two gangs it was a reasonable possibility that such a confrontation would involve violence. That became the reality almost immediately. After the affray had ended, it must have been obvious to the offender, and his companions, that their gang president was extremely displeased and had indicated that he wanted vengeance at the next opportunity, whenever that might be. 


18In dealing with Kisacanin's conduct in the Departure Hall his Honour said this-
30 The offender was one of those who picked up a bollard. There was no evidence as to what he did with it. However, he was clearly seen in security camera footage putting a bollard down in an area away from where the bollards had been placed to direct passengers queueing [sic] to check in. 

31 There is no evidence which positively identified the offender as one of those actively involved in the fighting. However, there was evidence from a witness who said that she saw a man come from in front of the check-in counters to join in the fighting that had broken out behind them (T1209). That was consistent with the path the offender took to approach the Hell's Angels from a different angle. There was evidence from another witness who said she saw a man pick up a bollard and swing it before she looked away. She described the clothing of this man in a fashion that could have been regarded by the jury as matching the offender (T974-948). Another witness saw a man ""from another fight"" casually putting a bollard down (T2326). 

32 The evidence of each of these witnesses, considered separately, was incapable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was involved in the actual use of violence. However, when considered together, as well as with the descriptions of a large number of witnesses as to how many men were involved in the fighting, I am satisfied that the offender did play a role in it, even though I am not able to make a precise finding as to what he actually did. 

Parity 

19Dealing with the need to ensure parity of sentencing his Honour said this in sentencing the applicant-

80 I have borne in mind the sentences imposed upon the various offenders convicted for offences other than riot. It is important to retain some proportionality but they are of limited significance.

81 More significant are the sentences imposed upon others who have been sentenced for the offence of riot: see R v Eken; R v Potrus, supra, and R v Kisacanin [2012] NSWSC 91.

82 The starting point for the sentences imposed upon Eken and Potrus was 6 years 3 months and for Kisacanin it was 6 years. I have carefully reviewed the findings that I made in terms of the objective seriousness of their offences and their own personal circumstances and mitigating features. I have concluded that the seriousness of the offence in the present case is worse because (a) he was one of the organisers in mobilising the Comancheros to go to the airport; (b) he came armed with a knife; and (c) his culpability in terms of involvement in the fighting was greater in that at one point he had an opponent in a headlock and at another he intended to produce his knife. The subjective features, on balance, are not greatly different.

20It was submitted for the applicant that his Honour unnecessarily concluded that sentences imposed for other offences were of limited significance and that the parity principle should apply even by comparison for sentences imposed for manslaughter. Reference was made to Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49 per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ at [30]- 

In Lowe v The Queen and in Postiglione v the Queen, this Court was concerned with the application of the parity principle to persons charged with the same offences arising out of the same criminal conduct or enterprise. Those decisions are not authority for the proposition that the principle applies only to persons so charged. The foundation of the parity principle in the norm of equality before the law requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form. Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application. Nevertheless, as Campbell JA recognised in Jimmy v The Queen, there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant. The existence of those difficulties may be accepted. So too may the inability of a court of criminal appeal to undertake, under the parity rubric, a de facto review of prosecutorial charging discretions. Those practical difficulties and limitations, however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle. The effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case, including differences between the offences with which co-offenders are charged.

21Reference was also made to Khan v R [2012] NSWCCA 132 per Rothman J at [53] and Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60 per Campbell JA at [202].

22It was pointed out that the undiscounted starting points for the sentences imposed for Eken and Potrus were six years and three months respectively and for Kisacanin six years, while that for the applicant was seven years. It was observed that the subjective cases of Eken, Potrus and Kisacanin were not significantly different from the applicant's. That observation may be accepted though, as we should explain, the applicant's co-offenders mounted more persuasive cases on their offers to plead guilty.

23The Crown pointed to the obstacles facing an applicant for leave to appeal against sentence where the sentencing judge is fully aware of the sentences imposed on co-offenders and has indicated the reasons for departing from them, particularly where the differences result from facts legitimately found by the sentencing judge. Reference was made to the judgment of Howie J, with whom the other members of this Court agreed in Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398 at [28].

24Comparing the applicant's sentence with those imposed on Eken, Potrus and Kisacani, counsel for the applicant attacked his Honour's remarks at [82] that the applicant was an organiser, came armed with a knife and had a greater involvement in the fight. It was submitted that the apparent distinctions made by his Honour were not distinctions at all. It was submitted first that the applicant's role in mobilising members of the club was relevant only to premeditation, whereas his Honour had commented at [37] -

I do not believe that the riot was planned or premeditated. 

25It was submitted that the mobilisation of members was not done with the intention of engaging in a confrontation of the sort that later ensued, so the fact that the applicant was the mobiliser did not aggravate his offence. 

26In our opinion his Honour's conclusion about lack of premeditation did not render irrelevant the applicant's position as organiser. As his Honour concluded, the members whom he summoned were alive to the possibility that there would be violent confrontation. To that extent the applicant's mobilising significant numbers of club members bore upon the sentence. No doubt also his presence with them as events unfolded at the airport encouraged them to play a part in the violence. 

27Dealing with the problem of the applicant's knife, his counsel submitted that since his Honour was expressly unable to say whether the applicant deliberately armed himself in anticipation of trouble at the airport or whether he carried the knife because that was his habit, his Honour could not sentence him on the basis that he attended at the airport intending to use the knife. The mere possession of it did not aggravate his criminality.

28There are three reasons why we would not accept that submission. First, it implied that an offender who habitually carries a knife in case the need to use it arises is less culpable than one who carries the knife only when he foresees that the occasion may arise to use it, a statement with which we do not agree. Secondly, although his Honour could not find exactly when the applicant formed the intention to use the knife, the applicant undoubtedly foresaw the need to use it as events developed. He did not go to Gate 5 because he believed that officials might seize the knife. Thirdly, he drew the knife intending to use it in the fight. A submission that his Honour could not have known whether the knife was drawn for attack or defence was misconceived. When a man willingly draws a knife and runs into a fight there is no significant distinction between offence and defence. 

29It seems to us that his Honour did not err in discriminating between the applicant on the one hand and Eken, Potrus and Kisacanin on the other by reference to their respective conduct. In our opinion the several sentences fell well within the range of his Honour's sentencing discretion.

30This ground of appeal has not been made good.

31The second ground of appeal asserts that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by comparing his sentence with that imposed on Menzies. In sentencing Menzies his Honour said this about his conduct at Gate 5- 
14 Almost immediately after emerging into the terminal there was a confrontation between Hawi and Wainohu. There was a short verbal argument before Wainohu was punched, causing him to fall to the ground. The witnesses AL and SP, two of the Comanchero members who pleaded guilty and gave evidence for the Crown, both said that they saw the offender punch Wainohu twice at the start of the confrontation. However, AL agreed in cross-examination that he told police that he did not see the offender punch Wainohu; rather he was only told about it. 

15 Members of the Comancheros were then observed to chase and assault Padovan. The affray escalated with him being violently punched and kicked. The fighting resulted in Padovan losing his shirt and at one stage he was on the ground being punched and kicked by numerous Comanchero members. There was no evidence that the offender was one of those who chased or assaulted Padovan. 

and this about the Departure Hall-
32 Hawi was found by the jury to be guilty of his murder. All of the other Comancheros were acquitted of murder. Some were also acquitted of manslaughter, while the jury could not agree in respect of manslaughter for Abounader and the offender. 

33 The Crown alleged at the trial that the offender was directly involved in the fatal assault upon the deceased. This was not accepted beyond reasonable doubt by the jury. The agreed basis for the offender's subsequent plea to manslaughter is that he was not directly involved in that assault but was complicit in the killing by virtue of being a participant in a joint criminal enterprise. 

34 The offender gave evidence in the trial. He said that he was trying to get away from an attack by the Hell's Angels behind the check-in counters. He proceeded through the counters to the front where ""there was just a big scuffle"". There were people fighting. He said, "" I ran in, started throwing punches. I seen Pirini, Peter Zervas, Anthony. We all sort of fell over. I was copping punches, throwing punches "". He noticed Eken on the ground with a Hell's Angels person on top of him, "" just laying into him "". He grabbed that person around his neck and punched him in the head to try and get him off Eken. He succeeded in doing that but the man turned around; there was a skirmish which resulted in them falling to the ground where they had what he said was ""a little scuffle"". They both got up, shaped up to each other for a couple of seconds and then the offender ""took off"" (T3976 - 3977). 

35 The offender's evidence must, of course, be understood in the context of him claiming that he was only acting in justifiable self-defence, a claim now disavowed by his plea of guilty. 


32Menzies was sentenced for manslaughter, which carries a longer maximum sentence than that for riot. Even so, maximum sentences for both offences are long, and there is no principle that requires a sentence for manslaughter always to exceed a sentence imposed for riot. There is likely to be a substantial overlap in assessed criminality and in the consequent discretion resting in the sentencing judge. The elements of the offences are different. This Court has commented many times on the extent of the range of discretion in sentencing for manslaughter.

33It is apparent from his Honour's remarks that Menzies did not perform the act that caused the death of the deceased and that his liability was accessorial. His Honour's description shows that Menzies willingly ran into a fight and exchanged blows with others. 

34Menzies was sentenced also for his part in the affray at Gate 5 but that was a less violent exchange between fewer men and there was such a strong connection between events there and events in the departure hall that the affray was bound to be seen only as introductory or preliminary to the riot. His Honour was concerned to impose a total effective sentence to reflect the totality of Menzies' criminality. 

35As to the respective acts of the applicant and Menzies in the departure hall, it seems to us that his Honour was entitled to regard as far more serious the deliberate acts of the applicant in holding on to the knife and drawing it with the intention of using it. That on top of the applicant's organisation and encouragement of others, including Menzies. Leaving aside his criminality associated with the knife, the part played by the applicant was at least as serious as Menzies'. 

36The undiscounted starting point of Menzies' sentence was one year and six months longer than the applicant's. In our opinion that was enough to reflect the difference between the charges in the light of the differences of their respective acts. 

37An attack was made on appeal on the custodial and parole components of the respective sentences. It was pointed out that whereas the applicant's non-parole period was 66 percent of his head sentence, Menzies' was 54 percent of his total effective sentence. It was submitted that Menzies' and the applicant's subjective cases were not significantly different, so his Honour erred in producing disproportionate sentences. 

38We do not accept that submission. There were important differences in the subjective cases. In sentencing Menzies his Honour expressed some important findings. Menzies was in a stable relationship. His partner continued to support him. He had strong family support. He had been in almost continuous employment before his arrest, having done a TAFE course. He had given up alcohol and illicit drugs. He had left the club and had had club tattoos removed. He had behaved himself on remand and had been given responsibilities in custody. He had given himself up to police. He had pleaded guilty about one month after the jury verdict. He had written about his sympathy for the family of Zervas and had acknowledged full responsibility for his actions. His Honour considered his remorse genuine and his risk of re-offending low. He assessed the prospects of rehabilitation as good. 

39The applicant, on the other hand, had not severed his relations with his club. He had avoided contact with colleagues but only because that was a condition of his bail. His Honour found that the prospect of not reoffending and of rehabilitation appeared to be reasonable. However, his Honour was not prepared to find as genuine the applicant's repeated assertions to be remorseful. His Honour considered that the statements might as easily be only self-serving. 

40The subjective cases seem otherwise to have been roughly similar. 

41In our opinion Menzies' markedly better subjective case was sufficient to justify his Honour's difference of approach. This ground of appeal has not been made good. 

42The only other ground of appeal pressed was the fourth, which asserted that his Honour gave the applicant insufficient discount for his plea of guilty and/or his earlier offer to plead guilty of manslaughter. 

43The events leading up to the applicant's plea of guilty are set out at [5] - [8] above. His Honour allowed the applicant a 15 percent discount from his sentence for his plea. He allowed each of Eken, Potrus and Kisacanin 20 percent for their pleas. The submission was that his Honour's discrimination was unjustified and that the applicant ought to receive a further 5 percent discount. The other grounds failing, that would lead to a reduction in his head sentence of 3.6 months and in his non-parole period of 2.4 months. 

44On the sentence hearing the Crown tendered an agreed statement of facts. It contained this paragraph- 

41 Counsel for the offender sought advice from the Crown Prosecutors before the jury were empanelled as to whether there was any point in making an offer to plead to manslaughter and was advised that it was likely that the Director would not accept such an offer. No such offer was made formally in writing.

45Also on sentence, apparently without notice and without reference to paragraph 41 of the agreed statement of facts, a file note, Exhibit 3, was tendered. It was in handwriting, apparently of the solicitor instructing the Crown Prosecutor. The body of the note is as follows:

Re: offer to plea to manslaughter

[Name] formally made offer to Crown for FA to plea to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment

→Formally refused by [Crown Prosecutor]

We were told by [Crown Prosecutor], [name] had written to the Crown (their sol) → Mans offer to plea
→not accepted

[Name], asked whether it was necessary to put offer in writing. [Crown Prosecutor] said no need, they have made a file note (told [name])

[Name] said my instructing solicitor has made a file note.

She said the file note will suffice.


46Having heard the evidence and the submissions of Counsel, his Honour retired to consider the matter. He returned to the bench after a short time to impose sentence. The Remarks on Sentence included these paragraphs- 

74 It is part of the agreed facts that ""counsel for the offender sought advice from the Crown Prosecutor before the jury were empanelled [at the first trial] as to whether there was any point in making an offer to plead to manslaughter and was advised that it was likely that the Director would not accept such an offer. No such offer was made formally in writing"". Whether the offender would have been prepared to plead guilty to anything will remain unknown; the question was not further explored after the Crown's response.

75 A file note of the offender's solicitor was tendered this morning confirming that on 10 May 2011, counsel ""formally made [an] offer to the Crown for [the offender] to plead to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment"" but that the offer was refused. Whilst I accept that such an offer was made, it was made much later than similar offers were made by other offenders for whom I allowed a reduction of sentence of 20 per cent.

47It was submitted on appeal that there was a tension between paragraph 74, based on paragraph 41 of the agreed statement of facts, and paragraph 75. No doubt that resulted from the parties' late production of the file note and what turned out to be the misleading tenor of paragraph 41 of the agreed statement of facts. However, we do not think that his Honour was misled. Paragraph [75] makes clear that his Honour accepted that there was a frank offer and a frank refusal. Moreover, the discount of 15 percent allowed was squarely in the range for a plea offered two weeks before the trial was due to commence.

48In sentencing Eken, Potrus and Kisacanin his Honour explained why he was allowing each a discount of 20 percent. Eken's solicitor wrote to the Crown on 1 November 2010 offering a plea of guilty of manslaughter. The offer was rejected. The solicitor wrote again on 16 May 2011 and again the offer was rejected. R v Eken; R v Potrus [2012] NSWSC 2 at [56] 

49The solicitor for Potrus wrote to the Crown in November 2010 conveying an offer to plead guilty of riot. The letter contained in addition an implicit invitation to the Crown to indicate whether it was prepared to accept a plea of guilty of manslaughter. The Crown responded that it would accept only a plea of guilty of murder R v Eken; R v Potrus [2012] NSWSC 2 at [72]. 

50On 18 November 2010, the solicitor for Kisacanin wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions conveying an offer to plead guilty to riot and affray in full discharge of the indictment for murder. The letter included a request for an indication as to what charge the Crown would accept a plea of guilty to in full satisfaction of the indictment. His Honour, in sentencing, regarded that as an invitation to offer manslaughter. The Director replied that only a plea to murder and affray would be acceptable. R v Kisacanin [2012] NSWSC 91 at [54].

51In our opinion his Honour was entitled to regard as significant the six months that elapsed between the co-offenders' approaches and the applicant's, made only two weeks before the commencement of the trial. This was a very large case with many witnesses. It lasted for six months. The original estimate was longer than that. The Prosecuting authorities must have expended a significant amount of time and money in preparing the case for trial before the applicant made his offer. It seems to this Court that his Honour's discrimination between the applicant and his co-offenders fell within the range of his Honour's sentencing discretion.

52This ground of appeal has not been made good.

53The orders of the Court will be -

(1)Grant leave to appeal against the sentence;

(2)Dismiss the appeal.

		24 May 2013",2013-05-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761508,Harding v R [2013] NSWSC 513,"sentence1On 14 February 2011, David Allen Harding murdered Christine Joy Anthony at her home in Narromine, New South Wales.
2He did so by pouring the contents of a bottle of methylated spirits, about 250ml, over the head and torso of Ms Anthony, and then setting her alight with his cigarette lighter.  He then left her home and abandoned her.  Ms Anthony could do nothing to help herself except call for help, because she was confined to a wheelchair.  
3Ms Anthony suffered partial thickness burns to about 40 per cent of her body and despite receiving emergency medical care, she suffered a cardiac arrest and was unable to be resuscitated.  She died on the morning of 15 February 2011.  
4Mr Harding was arrested late on the evening of 14 February 2011, and has been in custody ever since.  He was initially charged with attempting to murder Ms Anthony, and after her death, he was charged with her murder.
5On 17 October 2012, Mr Harding pleaded guilty to murder.  He was committed by the Local Court at Dubbo to the Supreme Court for sentence.  On 7 December 2012, when arraigned in the Supreme Court, Mr Harding adhered to his plea of guilty to murder.
6It is now time for Mr Harding to be sentenced for his crime.
7The Crimes Act 1900 provides a maximum term of imprisonment for the offence of murder of life imprisonment.  The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides for a standard non-parole period of 20 years.  This is not directly applicable in this case because of Mr Harding's plea of guilty, but it, together with the maximum penalty, nevertheless remains as a relevant guidepost to which the Court may have regard: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120
Judicial Task on Sentencing8In the circumstances of this present case, it is appropriate that I remind myself of the judicial task on sentencing.
9In the present system of criminal justice, I must exercise a discretion as to what sentence should be imposed upon Mr Harding by applying well identified principles of law to the facts which I find: R v MacDonell (NSWCCA, 8 December 1995, unreported) per Hunt CJ at CL at [1]-[2].
10In the circumstances of this case, these principles of law require that I be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the facts upon which my sentence is based.  Here, the facts surrounding the offence are agreed.  Other facts, arising in the course of the sentencing process, and upon which Mr Harding relies, need only to be proved on the balance of probabilities by him.  
11The appropriate approach to sentencing is to identify all of the factors that are relevant to sentencing, identify their significance with the particular circumstances of the offence and then to make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence having regard to the purpose for which a sentence is to be imposed: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51] per McHugh J; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 at [26]; (2011) 244 CLR 120.
12I will apply these principles in the course of this sentence.
The Relevant Legislation13The Parliament of NSW has determined the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender.  Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that those purposes are:
""(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,
(c) to protect the community from the offender,
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.""
14Part 3 of the Sentencing Procedure Act sets out the relevant provisions that deal with sentencing procedures generally.  Of particular importance are the terms of s 21A, which identify aggravating, mitigating and other factors which a Court must, or may, take into account.  Those factors will need to be addressed in the course of this sentence.  It is not mandatory that the sentence is increased or diminished by any one or more of these factors.
15As well, the provisions of Division 1A of Part 4 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, are applicable when considering the sentence in this matter because the crime of murder is specified in Item 1 in the Standard Non-Parole Period Table incorporated into that Division.  The standard non-parole period applicable to this offence is 20 years.
Principles of Sentencing16The courts have developed clear guidance for the exercise of the sentencing discretion by every judge.  These common law principles are to be found in decided cases. 
17In summary, the common law principles include:
(a)Proportionality - namely that the sentence should be proportionate to the gravity of the offences: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ;
(b)Parity - namely, that any difference between sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence, ought not be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, and to give the appearance that justice has not been done: Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 617 per Dawson J, Gibbs CJ and Wilson J agreeing;
(c)Totality - namely, that when a person stands for sentence for a number of offences, the Court must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and determine what the appropriate sentence is for all of the offences: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59 per Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ;
(d)Avoidance of double punishment - namely that a person should not be punished twice for the same conduct: Pearce v The Queen [1988] HCA 57 (1998) 194 CLR 610.
18These principles have continuing relevance because s 21A(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act preserves the entire body of judicially developed sentencing principles: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [56]-[57]: Muldrock at [18].
19As well, factors established by the common law as affecting sentence, such as whether prison may be particularly burdensome, are also to be taken into account: Muldrock at [19].
20In considering the imposition of a sentence under s 54B of the Sentencing Procedure Act, the following considerations are appropriate:
(a)The effect of s 54B(2), despite its apparently mandatory terms, is to preserve the full scope of judicial discretion to impose a non-parole period longer or shorter than a standard non-parole period: Muldrock at [25];
(b)When read with s 21A, s 54B requires an approach to sentencing which is consistent with the judgment of McHugh J in Markarian at [51]; Muldrock at [26];
(c)In considering all factors relevant to sentencing the Court must keep in mind the two legislative guideposts: the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period: Muldrock at [27];
(d)In giving content in a specific case to the statutory phrase ""...an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness ..."", the assessment is made without reference to matters personal to an offender or class of offenders, and is made by reference wholly to the nature of the offending: Muldrock at [27];
(e)The standard non-parole period is not the starting point in sentencing for a mid-range offence after conviction: Muldrock at [31], nor does it have determinative significance in sentencing an offender: Muldrock at [32].
21I will need to bear in mind the legislation by which I am bound and the principles which the Courts have determined, when proceeding on this task of sentencing Mr Harding.
The Facts22I find the facts of the matter, in accordance with the Agreed Facts, to be as follows.  
23Mr Harding was born in September 1953, and was 57 at the time he killed Ms Anthony.  They had known each other since childhood and had been in a sexual relationship for about 14 months prior to the offence.  
24Mr Harding was in a de facto relationship at the time with another woman.  He and she also lived in Narromine, a short distance away from where Ms Anthony lived.  Ms Anthony had previously been married but was not in any permanent relationship at the time of her death.
25Ms Anthony suffered from an hereditary condition of spastic paraplegia, which had confined her to a wheelchair for about 20 years.  She lived on her own in her house in Narromine, and was visited once a day by a community nurse who assisted her with showering and other personal tasks.  She had a number of close friends and family members who would visit regularly.
26On the morning of 14 February 2011, Mr Harding, having left his home at about 9.30am, and having done some shopping at the local shopping centre, including purchasing a cask of Moselle wine, went to visit Ms Anthony shortly after 10am.  He assisted her with a few chores, and between about midday and 2pm they both drank a number of glasses of Moselle together.  At about 2pm, the community nurse called in to see Ms Anthony.  At that time, Mr Harding and Ms Anthony were sitting in the living area talking apparently amicably.  
27Mr Harding and Ms Anthony stayed in each other's company for the rest of the afternoon and into the evening.  It is quite unclear precisely what happened throughout that time.  It appears that there was an argument between Ms Anthony and Mr Harding about another male from Nevertire coming to live with her.  When this argument occurred, how long it continued for, and how it ended, are not matters which are contained within the Agreed Facts.
28I am satisfied that both Mr Harding and Ms Anthony continued to drink some of the Moselle wine.  At about 9.30pm, by which time the deceased was wearing a nylon nightgown, it appears that Mr Harding rose from his chair and picked up a bottle of methylated spirits which had been sitting on a bench in the kitchen area of Ms Anthony's apartment.  Methylated spirits was used by Ms Anthony for various personal hygiene purposes.  
29The methylated spirits was in a plastic bottle which had a childproof cap on it.  It required the person who wished to open the bottle, to depress the cap and twist it.  Mr Harding opened the childproof cap on the bottle, stood over Ms Anthony who was in her wheelchair, and then poured the contents of the bottle, which I am satisfied was about 250ml, over the head and torso of Ms Anthony.  
30He then took his cigarette lighter and set fire to Ms Anthony.  Mr Harding then left Ms Anthony's home carrying the plastic bottle.  It seems he shut the door behind him.  It is unclear how long it was between the time he set Ms Anthony alight and his leaving her home.
31Mr Harding walked down the back laneway and threw the plastic bottle into the backyard of one of the houses adjacent to that laneway.  Mr Harding walked past a witness at the end of the laneway and said:
""I'm going to get a bottle to stop any evidence pointing towards me"".
32Mr Harding walked home and spoke with his de facto.  He told her that Ms Anthony had ""dared him to set her alight"" and that the police would be around to see him soon.  I am not satisfied that Ms Anthony in fact dared Mr Harding to set her alight.
33Although Ms Anthony was alight and confined to her wheelchair when Mr Harding left her home, she was able to move her wheelchair around the house, seemingly in an attempt to call for help, or in a vain attempt to extinguish the flames.  She telephoned for help and two men arrived quickly.  They tipped water on Ms Anthony and called 000.  Ms Anthony told these two gentlemen that ""David poured metho on me and lit it"".  She said something similar to the police and ambulance officers when they arrived.  
34Ms Anthony was transported to Dubbo Base Hospital for emergency medical treatment and was then flown to Sydney.  It was intended that she be taken to the Burns Unit at Concord Hospital, but as she arrived at Sydney Airport, she suffered a cardiac arrest and despite treatment at the Intensive Care Unit at St George Hospital, which was the nearest hospital to the airport, she died as a result of her burns at about 9.20am on 15 February 2011.  
Police Investigation35Police secured the crime scene at Ms Anthony's home and at about 11.40pm on the night of 14 February 2011, attended the home of Mr Harding at Narromine.  Mr Harding was arrested by police and taken to the Narromine Police Station.
36Detective Heckendorf, who was present at the police station, could smell intoxicating liquor on Mr Harding's breath and noted that Mr Harding appeared to be slurring his words.  Mr Harding participated in an electronically recorded interview, commencing at 3.35am.  On 18 February 2012, he also participated in a video recorded walk through of the crime scene.  
37In the course of his recorded interview, Mr Harding gave broadly, two versions of the facts to the police officers.  The first was that Ms Anthony had dared him to set her alight, and that he did so.  The second version was that Mr Harding did not know the bottle contained methylated spirits, and threw it onto Ms Anthony from about three feet away, thinking that it was water and that the fire was lit accidentally when he passed a lit cigarette to her.
38I am well satisfied that neither of these accounts are correct.
39The unchallenged expert opinion provided by Professor Maitz, who is the Professor of Surgery of Burn Injuries at the Concord Hospital, and a leading expert in Australia in burn injuries, satisfies me that:
(a)it is unlikely that the methylated spirits was thrown onto Ms Anthony from three feet away;
(b)the most likely method of the methylated spirits being put onto Ms Anthony was by pouring it over her, whilst she was seated, by Mr Harding whilst he was standing on the right hand side of Ms Anthony; 
(c)that whilst this was happening, Ms Anthony tried to cover her face by raising her right arm and hand to her face, which were then covered by the methylated spirits;
(d)the origin of the fire was not in Ms Anthony's hair, but on a part her body;
(e)a lit cigarette could not be the source of the fire.
40A post-mortem examination of Ms Anthony revealed that she had a moderate blood alcohol level which was slightly higher than the legal limit for driving, which is likely to reflect the ingestion of alcohol to only a moderate degree shortly before she was set alight.  
Specific Statutory Considerations41As I have earlier said, it is necessary to identify the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors provided for by the legislation.  An aggravating factor, which is accounted for as being an element of the offence, does not warrant any additional regard.
Aggravating FactorsMr Harding's record of previous convictions: s 21A(2)(d) Sentencing Procedure Act.  42Mr Harding's past criminal record is very poor.  Since he was first convicted of an offence of violence for assaulting a female in 1982, Mr Harding has been convicted of about 15 separate offences of assault, of one form or another including, on one occasion, the assault being one which has occasioned actual bodily harm.  As well, he has five convictions for being in breach of, or else contravening, provisions of, apprehended domestic violence orders, or apprehended violence orders, and he has four convictions for stalking or intimidating either police officers or others.  
43Since his first conviction in 1982, the balance of his convictions have continued up until the time of this offence.  He has spent time in prison for some of these offences.
44This record is relevant to consider because it means that Mr Harding is not entitled to the benefit of any leniency which may impact upon the sentence to be imposed.  
House of the victim: s 121A(2)(eb) Sentencing Procedure Act.  45Although the statute describes this as an aggravating factor because all people are entitled to feel safe in their home, and safe from being attacked in their home, where, as in this case, Mr Harding was invited into Ms Anthony's home and remained there with her consent, this is not an aggravating factor: DS v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 159 at p[145] per Beazley JA, Harrison and McCallum JJ.
Offence involves gratuitous cruelty: s 21A(2)(f) Sentencing Procedure Act.  46Here I am satisfied that the offence did involve gratuitous cruelty.  The use of fire in the circumstances where Ms Anthony was physically unable to put it out, combined with Mr Harding leaving the premises without making any attempts to extinguish the fire or call for help, in my assessment constitutes gratuitous cruelty.  
Subject to conditional liberty: s 21A(2)(j) Sentencing Procedure Act47At the time that he committed this offence, Mr Harding was on bail for charges of common assault and contravening an apprehended domestic violence order.  
48The terms of his bail required him to be of good behaviour whilst awaiting the disposition of those charges.  His failure to comply with that obligation aggravates his conduct in this case.  
49However, in the entire context this is a matter of limited weight.  
Victim of offence is vulnerable: s 21A(2)(l) Sentencing Procedure Act.  50The fact that Ms Anthony, because of her long term hereditary paraplegia, was confined to a wheelchair, meant that she was a vulnerable person.  Ms Anthony was not in a position to defend herself against this offence.  She was not in a position to stop Mr Harding pouring the methylated spirits on her, she could not run away, nor was she easily able to extinguish the fire once it had been lit.  She was not in a position easily to call for help, although ultimately she managed to do so.  This, in my assessment, in the circumstances of this case, is a serious aggravating factor.
Mitigating FactorsThe offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity: s 21A(3)(b) Sentencing Procedure Act.  51This offence did not have any suggestion of a planned or organised criminal activity, on the contrary it seems to have been somewhat spontaneous.  In the circumstances, this has a mitigatory effect.
Likelihood of re-offending: s 21A(3)(g), and Prospect of Rehabilitation: s21A(h) Sentencing Procedure Act.  52I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that Mr Harding is unlikely to re-offend, nor am I satisfied that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.  His lengthy history of past criminal convictions, his easy resort to violence, and his lack of capacity or will to refrain from drinking alcohol and abusing it, all satisfy me that these mitigating factors do not exist in this case.
Remorse: s 21A(3)(i) Sentencing Procedure Act.  53It is a mitigating factor if an offender shows remorse, provided that he accepts responsibility for his actions, and acknowledges the injury which has occurred.  Mr Harding's plea of guilty is an acceptance of his responsibility for the offence.  
54During his interview with police, Mr Harding was asked if he was sorry for what he had done, and he said that he was very sorry for it.  Whilst it is possible to regard this as a statement of remorse, I am not satisfied that I can accord it very much weight.  It was not a volunteered statement, but rather an answer to a targeted question.  I did not detect in any of the evidence before me, any acknowledgement of what Mr Harding had done or any specific expression of remorse.  
55Whilst it will be appropriate to acknowledge, with an appropriate discount, his plea of guilty, I am not satisfied that Mr Harding has shown any real remorse for his crime, such as would constitute a significant mitigating factor of the kind contemplated by the legislation.  
Other Factors56Where an offender has pleaded guilty to an offence, such as Mr Harding has done in this case, a court is obliged to take the fact that the offender has pleaded guilty into account in passing sentence for the offence: s 22 Sentencing Procedure Act.
57A plea of guilty is relevant for a court to consider in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed, because such a plea saves the community a considerable amount of time and money which contested committal hearings and trials would involve.  It is a substantial facilitation of the course of justice.  However, any lesser penalty imposed by reason of a plea of guilty, must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. 
58It was submitted by counsel for Mr Harding, and the Crown accepted, that Mr Harding's plea of guilty had been entered at the first reasonably available opportunity.  He is entitled to the maximum level of discount of 25 per cent in those circumstances.  
Mr Harding's Criminality59It is appropriate to make an assessment of the criminality involved in Mr Harding's offence.  This is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to Mr Harding, and is to be assessed wholly by reference to the nature of the offending: Muldrock at [27].  In making this assessment, and concordant with my understanding of Muldrock, I will not take into account the facts and circumstances relating to Mr Harding's alcohol abuse and low intellect, to which I will in due course come.
60In my assessment, the criminality was extremely serious.  Mr Harding has murdered a severely disabled woman in her own home by setting her alight and walking out, leaving her to her fate without calling for help.  He clearly knew what he was doing, and had done, and then thought about doing something to cover up his offence.
61Ms Anthony was an innocent, unknowing and defenceless woman in her own home.  She apparently trusted Mr Harding and regarded him as a friend.  She was a woman who had not done anything which warranted the brutal attack to which she was subjected.  
62It is hard to imagine a more excruciatingly painful death than that to which Ms Anthony was subjected.  She was conscious when she was set alight, and when help arrived, but severely burnt.  As the burns engulfed her body, she could feel the physical pain involved, but could do nothing to ameliorate it.  Her mental suffering, including her fear of what was to happen, must have been truly awful.
63The Crown submitted that the offence fell within the worst category of offences of this kind.  In order to characterise any case as being in the worst category, it must be possible to point to: 
""... particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from the subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed) ...""
R v Twala (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 November 1994).
64Whilst this crime has a very serious level of criminality, I am not presently persuaded that it should be categorised as falling into the worst case category if for no other reason than that I am satisfied that this was not a premeditated offence and the killing was not surrounded by other unlawful conduct.  
65Also, I am not satisfied that the offence was accompanied by an intention on Mr Harding's part to kill Ms Anthony.  I am well satisfied that Mr Harding intended to cause grievous bodily harm.  I infer this intention from the deliberate nature of what occurred in the context that it must have been obvious to anyone that setting alight to a person covered in methylated spirits would lead to serious physical injury.  
66As best as can be determined, in assessing the objective criminality of Mr Harding's conduct, I am persuaded that on the probabilities, he set fire to Ms Anthony because he was in a state of jealous anger which derived from their argument about another man, and whilst in that state, or consequent upon it, he set alight to her intending to cause grievous bodily harm.  
67I would assess the objective seriousness of this offence and the criminality involved, as being very high, and approaching but not reaching the worst case category.  
Victim Impact Statement68The Court has heard a statement read by Dee Dickinson, who is the sister of Ms Anthony.  Clearly, this crime has touched the members of Ms Anthony's family, and I recognise that it has affected them all deeply.  
69I will have such regard to this evidence as the law permits: R v Previtera [1997] 94 A Crim R 76; s 28 Sentencing Procedure Act.
Subjective circumstances of Mr Harding70Mr Harding is now 59 years old.  He was 57 when he murdered Ms Anthony.  
71He was born and raised in Mudgee in a stable family.  He was the third of 15 children.  He left school at about 14 years of age, and then worked as a farm hand, in an abattoir and as a transport driver, or off-sider, delivering hay.  In about 1970 he married.  The marriage lasted about 20 years, before he separated from his wife in 1990.  There have not been any formal divorce proceedings.  From that marriage he had two children.  He adopted his wife's daughter born to her during a previous marriage.  He has no contact with his children or with his former wife.  Since this incident occurred, he has not had any contact with his siblings or other members of his family.  
72Mr Harding has a lengthy history of alcohol abuse.  It seems that he first started drinking alcohol at age 13.  At times, he seems to have been drinking as many as 30 standard alcohol drinks in the course of a day or evening.  The drinking of alcohol has been associated with many of his past criminal offences, and with his exhibiting violence.  He does not seem to have done very much to remediate his alcohol abuse.  It is one factor which has contributed to his acquired brain injury.  
73In 1985, Mr Harding suffered a traumatic head and brain injury in a motorcycle accident.  Recently, an MRI brain scan was completed and reported on as being suggestive of previous trauma.  
74I accept Dr Westmore's opinion that Mr Harding's brain scan confirms that he has an acquired brain injury, and that such injury is permanent.  I also accept Dr Westmore's opinion that the causes of that acquired brain injury are likely to be multiple, including damage caused by chronic alcohol abuse.  Neurological testing demonstrates that Mr Harding operates at a low level of intellectual function, being in either the low average range or the extremely low range.  Some of his intellectual function was rated as being in the borderline range.  Dr Hepner's opinion, which I accept, is that Mr Harding has impairment evident in his current level of intellectual function attention, memory for spoken lengthy information, processing speed and in the areas of frontal executive function including speed and flexibility of thinking, verbal fluency and planning and organisation. 
75However, neuropsychological testing did not reveal any evidence of impulsivity, disinhibition or perseveration.
76As history shows, notwithstanding the effects of his acquired brain injury, Mr Harding has been able to live and function in the community.  He has been able to be employed from time to time.  In particular, his acquired brain injury and low intellect do not explain his lack of self-control, nor do they provide any basis for excusing impulsive actions as being beyond his control.
77Neither Dr Westmore nor Dr Hepner expressed an opinion that Mr Harding did not know, or was not capable of understanding, the conduct in which he engaged, and the criminality which was involved.
78I accept Dr Westmore's opinion that the probabilities are that the alcohol consumed by Mr Harding is the primary cause of his offending behaviour because the alcohol is likely to have affected his capacity to consider options or alternatives, to exercise self-control, to consider the likely consequences of his actions and to some degree, appreciate the seriousness of his conduct.  
79Mr Harding has a long history of being quick to anger.  This existed before his acquired brain injury.  His tendency to anger has been often seen in conjunction with his tendency for violence.  In this case, except for setting Ms Anthony alight, there are no signs of violence.  She did not appear to have been physically assaulted.  There did not seem to have been any signs of violence in her house.  Furniture and fittings were not damaged.  When seen in the immediate aftermath of the offence, Mr Harding appeared calm and apparently composed.  His tendency to anger does not provide a ready explanation for what occurred, but it does seem that his jealousy provides an explanation for his conduct.
Sentence80In considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Mr Harding, I commence with the reminder that murder involves a criminal taking of a human life.  It is a violation of the sanctity of human life which is a concept at the heart of a civilised community.  
81Ordinarily, a conviction for murder warrants a substantial sentence because the demands of punishment and the deterrence of the broader community against similar conduct are of significant importance.  Mr Harding's limited intellect provides a reason to mitigate the need for specific deterrence.
82I am not satisfied that I should make a finding of special circumstances as the law permits: s 44(2) Sentencing Procedure Act.  Mr Harding submitted that special circumstances existed because of his need for rehabilitation upon release back into the community.  Mr Harding's past history of offending, the significant periods of time which he has spent in custody, and his low prospects of rehabilitation, all tell against his future reintegration into society as constituting an adequate basis for a finding of special circumstances.
83I have discussed all of the facts which are relevant to this decision, and it is now necessary to make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence.
84This was a very serious offence involving the killing of a vulnerable woman in her own home, in a way which involved gratuitous cruelty.  The killing was committed by a friend with a lengthy previous criminal history, who could have attempted to save his victim from her excruciatingly painful ordeal, but abandoned her to her fate, and did not call for medical help.
85Mr Harding's history of chronic alcohol abuse and low intellectual function provide only a context to the events, but do not explain or justify his cowardly conduct.
86There is nothing which adequately explains or justifies the conduct.  It would be inappropriate to speculate about why Mr Harding did what he did, but I am satisfied that an argument arising from jealousy must have had a role to play in what happened.  In short, the Court must proceed to impose a sentence for a very serious and largely, although not entirely, unexplained offence.
87Any sentence which is to be imposed is mitigated only by his plea of guilty and the substantial facilitation of the course of justice which that involves.
88I determine the appropriate sentence to be one of 36 years imprisonment.  However, Mr Harding is entitled to be given an appropriate discount for the fact that he has pleaded guilty to the offence.  In the circumstances here relevant, that discount ought be 25 per cent.  Accordingly, the total appropriate sentence is one of 27 years imprisonment.  Of that sentence, I determine that Mr Harding must spend 20 years and 3 months in jail before being eligible for parole.  
Offence of Serious Personal Violence89I am required to warn Mr Harding, which I now do, of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, and the fact that that Act applies to the offence of which he has been convicted, and for which he is to be sentenced.

		18 June 2013",2013-05-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761513,Application by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2013] NSWSC 607,"Judgment1This is an application under s 19 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) in relation to property more particularly identified in Schedules 1 and 2 of the Summons.  The application is supported by the affidavit of Katrina Renae Hoyes of 6 May 2013. 
2I am satisfied, having read Ms Hoyes's affidavit, that the application is made by a Proceeds of Crime Authority and that Ms Hoyes is an authorised officer within the meaning of s 338 of the Act in that regard. 
3I am satisfied that Ms Hoyes has the suspicions set out in paragraphs 9 and 10 of her affidavit that the identified sums of money are the proceeds of an indictable offence and/or an instrument of a serious offence within the meaning of s 19 of the Act. 
4Having read the remainder of the affidavit together with the material in the exhibit to that affidavit, including the statement of facts, I am satisfied that the suspicion that is held by Ms Hoyes is held on reasonable grounds. 
5The persons against whom the orders are sought have appeared today and have consented to the orders under s 19. 
6Two other persons whom the plaintiff reasonably believes may have an interest in the property have been notified pursuant to s 26 of the Act of the present application.  Those persons are Joan Phoi Man Vong and Yun Sil Choi.  There is evidence that Ms Choi was personally served with a letter informing her of the application and when it would be heard.  There is  evidence that documents for Ms Vong were left with her mother but that subsequently the solicitor for the plaintiff has spoken on two occasions with Ms Vong.  The solicitor is satisfied that Ms Vong is aware of the letter which was left with her mother and is aware of the date on which these proceedings were to be heard in the first instance, that is today.
7I am satisfied therefore that proper notice has been given under s 26 of the Act to those two persons. 
8Accordingly, I make orders in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 4 of the Short Minutes of Order that have been agreed between the Plaintiff, Mr Ma and Mr Ng, for whom Mr Green and Mr Smith respectively appear.  I note the terms of paragraph 8 of the Short Minutes of Order.
Orders
9Orders as per paragraphs 1 - 4 and 7 of the Plaintiff's SMO in the following terms:
1. Pursuant to section 19(1)(b) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (the Act) the property specified in Schedule One of the Summons must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person except in the manner and circumstances specified in these Orders.
2. Pursuant to section 19(1)(b) of the Act, the property specified in Schedule Two of the Summons must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person except in the manner and circumstances specified in these Orders.
3. Pursuant to section 38 of the Act, the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy is to take custody and control of the property specified in Schedule One.
4. Pursuant to section 38 of the Act, the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy is to take custody and control of the property specified in Schedule Two.
5. The proceedings be stood over to 9.00am on 18 June 2013 before the Common Law Registrar.
10The Court notes paragraph 8 of the Short Minutes of Order in the following terms:
Shiau-Yi Ma warrants to the Commonwealth that he has no interest, claim or right in respect of the property specified in Schedule Two.

2761514,Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors [2013] NSWDC 63,"Judgment

The plaintiff's claim and the defendants' Notices of Motion

1The plaintiff, Dr Ghosh, is a medical practitioner and a director of a company which owns two rental properties at Surfers Paradise. She commenced proceedings in the Newcastle Registry of the District Court on 22 March 2013 pleading causes of action against Ninemsn Pty Ltd, News Limited and ""Fairfax Media for Stayz Pty Ltd"" as follows:

""1. Repeated slander and defamation of 15 Bundall Rd, Surfers Paradise in the media including but not restricted to Channel 9 / NBN News, ""A Current Affair"", NBN websites including ""Places Not to Stay"", The Gold Coast Bulletin Newspaper, websites owned by Fairfax Media including rentahome.com.au [sic]

2. Repeated slander and defamation by Stayz employees including Justin Butterworth to other holiday rental websites advertising 15 Bundall Rd Surfers Paradise, including Bookastay, urging and inducing other websites to remove the holiday rental listing, causing financial loss to me, without any just cause [sic]

3. Refusal to list the holiday rental listing for 15 Bundall Rd Surfers Paradise and repeatedly removing the listing by Faifax [sic] Media owned websites including Stayz, rentahome without any warning to me or just cause and refused refund of fees paid for listinmg of both my houses, [sic]

4. Trespassing 15 Bundall Rd Surfers Paradise by Channel 9 and The Gold Coast Bulletin photographers and journalists who breached privacy by publishing photos and slanderous stories about the house and its owners by unilaterally interviewing the neighbours and never attempting to contact the owners [sic] (myself), publishing and airing on national TV any trash the neighbours told them without any warning to me or ever trying to contact me. Breached privacy of tenants also, [sic]""

2All three defendants brought applications for summary dismissal, returnable on 29 April 2013. These are the motions which are before me today for hearing. This judgment sets out the reasons for making orders, as due to the lateness of the hour I was not able to deliver an oral judgment on Friday afternoon.

3Ninemsn Pty Ltd, the first defendant, filed a Notice of Motion on 17 April 2013 (supported by an affidavit of Paul Svilans dated 16 April 2013) seeking summary dismissal pursuant to rr 13.5 and 14.29 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR""). News Limited, the second defendant, relied on an affidavit of Marlia Ruth Saunders in support of its Notice of Motion seeking similar orders. ""Fairfax Media for Stayz Pty Ltd"", the third defendant, filed a Notice of Motion on 23 April 2013 seeking relief under r 14.28 UCPR and relying on an affidavit of Leanne Norman dated 23 April 2013. All three defendants sought orders in the alternative for the transfer of these proceedings from the Newcastle registry to the Defamation List in Sydney.

The background to these applications

4The property owned by the plaintiff's company is in a residential area of Surfers Paradise. In late 2009 neighbours gave a videotape they had shot of activities in and around one or both of these houses, and the canal which lies behind the houses in this street, to Channel 9 Gold Coast. According to the publications annexed to the plaintiff's Statement of Claim in the Supreme Court of Queensland (MFI 1), the neighbours complained that this house was used by short-term tenants as a ""party house"" for ""24 hours a day"" and ""48 hour benders"". The neighbours complained they could not avoid seeing the house's occupants engaged in disgusting activities such as sexual activities and urinating in public, vomiting, drunken behaviour and walking around naked. These activities extended outside the house, as the tenants went swimming in (and, on occasion, urinated in) the adjoining canal, which ran past all their homes. The neighbours said they were frightened by seeing these tenants trashing the premises, and were unable to sleep because of the loud music at all hours, as well as swearing and shouting. Local Councillor Susie Douglas was quoted as saying that this ""has been happening a lot in this area"", and that a temporary local planning instrument was being put in place to close the ""loophole"" of using accommodation agents rather than real estate agents for very short lettings.

5The plaintiff commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland in 2010 against News Limited, Gold Coast Publications Pty Ltd and NBN Limited for a newspaper publication of 21 December 2009, a publication on the Internet and the NBN news story. These proceedings are still on foot. 

6There were further broadcasts, Internet publications and articles, approximately 47 of which are contained in the statement of claim in these proceedings. ""A Current Affair"" broadcast a programme in 2011, and following this the plaintiff commenced proceedings in the local court system against the residents. In November 2011 the plaintiff made a complaint to the Press Council, according to her email of 15 May 2012 (MFI 1). I have no information about the extent to which there is any overlap between these events and the publications the subject of this application, principally because there is so little information about the content of each of the matters complained of; in most cases, the text of the matter complained of has not been provided.

7The plaintiff complains that following these publications, accommodation agencies (such as the third defendant in these proceedings) were refusing to accept bookings for these houses and had taken these properties off their website. I have no information as to the nature and extent of any claims the plaintiff may have brought against these agencies, including any proceedings to obtain refunds of payments made or claims of loss from cancellation of bookings.

8On 5 March 2013 ""A Current Affair"" broadcast a programme ""Party House Misery"" (http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8621374) and on 6 March 2013 the Gold Coast Bulletin published a follow-up article. The plaintiff then filed a Statement of Claim in the District Court at Newcastle and issued three subpoenae (two to the defendants and one to bookastay.com.au).

The procedural history of these applications

9The defendants' applications for summary judgment was listed by the court for directions on 29 April 2013 and both parties were notified. The plaintiff, who was on vacation that week, was not able to appear. When contacted by counsel for the defendants, she agreed to the hearing of the motions proceeding on 8 May 2013. I made directions for both parties to supply written submissions in relation to the summary judgment application. The defendants complied. On 6 May 2013, the plaintiff faxed to the court a 56-page draft amended statement of claim which dropped the claim against Ninemsn Pty Ltd, joined two new defendants, NBN Limited and Gold Coast Publications Pty Ltd, and repleaded her case as being four actions for defamation on 5 March 2013, 21 December 2009 to 22 May 2010, 28 November 2011 and ""a series of television shows"" in November 2011.

10Unfortunately, Dr Ghosh did not provide a copy of the draft statement of claim to the defendants. This meant that their motions could not be heard on 8 May, as the causes of action and defendants had changed. I made an order striking out the statement of claim filed on 22 March 2013 and stood over part-heard the plaintiff's application for leave to amend the statement of claim to be heard in the Sydney registry on 16 May. I also set aside subpoenae issued by the plaintiff to one or more of the defendants and a third party on the basis that these subpoenae were issued prematurely. 

The parties to the litigation

11The names of the defendants in these proceedings have changed in each draft of the statement of claim. Dr Ghosh has served another proposed statement of claim this morning, joining an additional proposed fourth defendant, Miss Katie Gregory of A Current Affair (whom Dr Ghosh served this morning in Newcastle), as well as faxing the court a 40-page annexure.

12In the interests of efficiency, Gold Coast Publications Pty Ltd and NBN Limited, who have not been served, take no issue on this point; nor does Miss Gregory complain about the lateness. They seek leave to be heard on these applications; references to ""the defendants"" in this judgment therefore include them. 

13The plaintiff, who is not named in most of the publications, is a director of a company which owns the house at Surfers Paradise referred to in the Statement of Claim. She has been ""a majority owner (99%)"" since June 2007, according to her correspondence with the defendants. Identification of the plaintiff as an individual may represent a difficulty unless particulars of identification are provided for each publication (Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa AG (1985) 1 NSWLR 188; Mahon v Mach 1 Financial Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 10).

14The defendants are currently as follows:

(a)The first defendant was Ninemsn Pty Ltd. The statement of claim refers to ""Channel 9"" and ""NBN News"". These are different legal entities. Ninemsn has been rejoined and is jointly listed as first defendant with NBN Limited.

(b)The second defendant was News Limited. Gold Coast Publications Pty Ltd, not a party to the 22 March 2013 claim, has now been added as a joint second defendant. It is unclear what News Ltd has to do with this claim. They are not the publishers of the Gold Coast Bulletin. The publisher of that newspaper is Gold Coast Newspapers Pty Ltd (affidavit of J Saunders, paragraphs [2] - [4]).

(c)The third defendant was previously described as ""Fairfax Media for Stayz Pty Ltd"". The third defendant is now identified as both these companies. These are two corporate entities. The proposed amended statement of claim contains no allegations concerning Fairfax Media.

(d)The fourth defendant, Miss Katie Gregory of "" A Current Affair"", was added this morning.

The applications for summary dismissal

15By reason of the difficulty of drafting defamation pleadings, courts for many years were reluctant to refuse to grant leave to amend other than in the clearest cases: Mann v Eccott (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 22 February 1989). The court's acceptance of a party's right to leave to amend must now be considered in accordance with s 64 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and this Act's overriding purposes, as set out in ss 56 and 58. The principles to apply in applications for leave to amend are set out in State of New South Wales v Radford (2010) 79 NSWLR 327 at [63] and Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University (2009) 239 CLR 175. A practical example of the application of those rules in defamation proceedings may be seen in Price J's helpful setting out of the relevant principles in Markisic v State of New South Wales & Ors (No 2) [2012] NSWSC 1353. 

16As Price J explained in Markisic, supra, a party should not be denied a contested merits hearing unless the absence of a cause of action is clearly demonstrated (General Steel Industries Inc v Cmr for Railways (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129). There must be a high degree of certainty, as opposed to a merely complex or difficult to understand, or even novel, claim. The applicant bears the onus of proof. 

17Dr Ghosh is representing herself. Courts have always been vigilant, in the case of litigants in person, to ensure that they are not penalised for technical pleading failures or an inability to identify the cause of action with clarity: Morris v Wiltshire, The Times, 15 February 1994. However, such orders can be, and have been, made in circumstances where the proposed amendment is patently hopeless, such as claims which are time-barred: Sharples v Hanson [2006] FCA 37.

The causes of action pleaded by the plaintiff

18The first step is the identification of the causes of action pleaded by the plaintiff. These are principally a series of defamation actions, and a complaint of trespass and breach of privacy on two occasions. Other causes of action are, however, referred to:

(a)Claims of assault, stalking and harassment (referred to in the claim for aggravated compensatory damages at 11(vi)(a)).

(b)The particulars of aggravated damages refer to other defamatory publications which ""slander"" the plaintiff (11(vi)(c) - (e)). These allegations are not pleaded as causes of action so I have not treated them as such.

(c)There are also claims for loss of rental and ""immense financial loss"" throughout the pleading, which I propose to treat as a claim for special damages against all defendants, rather than an action for breach of contract against the third defendant.

The defamation claims

19The plaintiff provided me with the current proposed amended statement of claim this morning. That document did not annex the texts of the matters complained of. I have managed to put much of this information together from the 40 further pages of documents faxed to me by Dr Ghosh this morning, and from the documents annexed to MFI 1.

The first matter complained of (three publications dated 5 and 6 March 2013)

20The first matter complained is actually three publications: 

(a)""A Current Affair"" as broadcast by NBN on 5 March 2013;

(b)publication of that broadcast on the Internet (which is still accessible); and,

(c)an email publication by Stayz Pty Ltd dated 6 March 2013. 

21It is not permissible for these publications to be rolled up into one claim, with one set of imputations pleaded to arise. I will not grant leave to file the amended pleading in its current form. Each publication must be pleaded as a separate publication with separate imputations and separate particulars of identification where required: Gatley on Libel and Slander (Sweet & Maxwell) at [6.2]; Brown on Defamation (Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States), Second Edition (Carswell) at [18.4(5)]. It is not possible to deal with other pleading issues, such as the imputations asserted to arise, until these requirements have been complied with.

22Leave to file an amended pleading setting out each of these publications, with the matters complained of attached, and appropriate particulars, will be granted, but this leave will be limited, as the plaintiff must comply with the requirements set out in [49] below.

The second matter complained of (more than 22 publications between 21 December 2009 to 22 August 2010)

23This is a rolled-up claim for eight publications in the Gold Coast Bulletin Newspaper and on its website and two broadcasts on Channel 9/NBN and the NBN/Ninemsn website. Each of the eight Gold Coast Bulletin articles also appeared on the Internet, and each Internet publication must be pleaded separately to the print publication. The print publications are:

(a)21 December 2009, ""Residents' Party House Hell"", by Kerryn Anker.

(b)22 December 22 December 2009, ""Party House from Hell investigated"", by Kerryn Anker.

(c)22 December 2009, ""Website coming to party on noise"", by Kerryn Anker.

(d)4 January 2010, ""Party pads cause hell in suburbs"", by Lucy Arden.

(e)21 January 2-10, ""Party could be over for rent rowdies"", by Geoff Chambers.

(f)22 April 2010, ""Push to ban party houses from hell"", by Melinda Marshall.

(g)22 May 2010, ""Law hits party homes"", by Melinda Marshall.

(h)21 August 2010, ""Houses to hell-holes as holiday hedonists party"", by Dwayne Grant.

24An additional claim ""Holiday House Nightmare"" on 20 December 2009 brings the total to nine print publications and nine Internet publications, a total of 18. The reason each of these is asserted to refer to the plaintiff's house is that an album of photos of the house(s) her company owns are included.

25There are also two broadcasts. The first was broadcast on Channel 9/NBN News on 21 December 2009. The second is on the NBN/Ninemsn website (paragraph 4(B)). The particulars of publication suggest more publications, but these cannot be further identified.

26In addition to the 18 claims for defamation which form part of the second matter complained of, there is a claim of trespass and ""tampering with evidence of a crime scene"" on 20 December 2009 (paragraph 5). These events occurred in Queensland, where s 10 Limitation of Actions Act 1974 (Qld) provides a limitation period for trespass of six years. These claims are dealt with separately below.

27While each of these publications should be pleaded as a separate matter complained of, these claims suffer from more fundamental problems, namely:

(a)Any action brought on these publications is statute-barred pursuant to s 14B Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) which provides that a cause of action for defamation is not maintainable if brought after the end of a limitation period of one year running from the date of publication of each of the matters complained of. While the court has power to grant an extension pursuant to s 56A Limitation Act 1969, that period has also expired. There are similar provisions in every State and Territory of Australia; for example, in Queensland the relevant provisions are s 10AA and s 32A Limitation of Actions Act (Qld).

(b)Further, the plaintiff would require leave to commence proceedings pursuant to s 23 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) as she commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland against NBN Limited, News Limited and Gold Coast Publications Pty Ltd in early 2010 (MFI 2). Such leave was refused in Bracks v Smyth-Kirk [2008] NSWSC 930, where the plaintiff had commenced, and discontinued, proceedings in another jurisdiction. While the Queensland proceedings are still on foot, to commence proceedings in another Australian in relation to the same publications is an abuse of process: Maple v David Syme Pty Ltd [1975] 1 NSWLR 97.

(c)News Limited is not the publisher of the Gold Coast Bulletin, which is published by Gold Coast Publications Pty Ltd.

28The plaintiff should not be granted leave to amend to bring proceedings for any of the publications asserted to form part of the second matter complained of. The defendants' application for summary dismissal in relation to this cause of action is granted.

The third matter complained of (two publications dated 28 November 2011)

29The third matter complained of is the Gold Coast Bulletin publication on 28 November 2011, which was separately published on the Internet website.

30Any action brought on this publication is statute-barred pursuant to s 14B Limitation Act 1969 (NSW), which provides that a cause of action for defamation is not maintainable if brought after the end of a limitation period of one year running from the date of publication of each of the matters complained of. No application has been brought for an extension of time under s 56A. As the plaintiff commenced proceedings against the Gold Coast Bulletin in the Supreme Court of Queensland in 2010 for a publication dated 21 December 2009 (MFI 2), the plaintiff would not, I find, satisfy the difficult test under s 14B.

31There is also a claim for damages, as the plaintiff says she has suffered ""immense financial loss"" (paragraph 10). The plaintiff cannot avoid the limitation period for defamation by bringing a claim for damages (whether by breach of contract or otherwise) by framing her claim in contract or tort rather than defamation: Mahon v Mach 1 Financial Services Pty Ltd (No 2), supra. Furthermore, the claim for ""immense financial loss"" is itself objectionable. In McGrane v Channel Seven Brisbane Pty Ltd [2012] QSC 133 the plaintiff's claim was struck out, inter alia, by reason of a ""ridiculous claim"" (at [47]) for special damages. That does not, of itself, constitute a reason for striking the matter out without leave to replead, but it is an indication of the difficulties which lie ahead for these pleadings (currently on their third draft), and is one of the reasons why these proceedings require careful case management in the Defamation List.

32In addition, News Limited is not the publisher of the Gold Coast Bulletin and should not have been joined as a party.

33By reason of each of the above matters, the plaintiff should not be granted leave to replead any cause of action based upon the publication of 28 November 2011. 

The fourth matter complained of: broadcasts made ""repeatedly"" between 2009 - 2013 by National Nine News and A Current Affair (10 broadcasts and 10 Internet publications)

34The fourth matter complained of is a rolled-up series of claims against Channel Nine and NBN as follows:

(a)3 May 2013, ""Party House RIP"";

(b)22 March 2013, ""Party Houses a big pain on Gold Coast"";

(c)13 June 2012 ""Crack down on party houses"";

(d)13 June 2012 ""New powers to shut down Gold Coast party houses"";

(e)13 June 2012, ""Party House""

(f)9 January 2012, ""New-age suburban warfare"";

(g)23 November 2011 (or 15 December) ""Naked neighbours"";

(h)22 November 2011 ""The naked neighbour row - A Current Affair on Facebook"";

(i)15 December 2011 ""ACA Naked Neighbours"" on Facebook;

(j)A claim which featured in the previous draft, 5 September 2011 ""Nude neighbours fight back"", has been omitted. This appears to be an oversight by the plaintiff, so I have brought it to her attention. The plaintiff is uncertain if her house is identified or not. Nevertheless, the time to commence proceedings has passed. 

35One set of imputations is pleaded for all of these publications. This is impermissible. Each publication should have been pleaded separately, and a transcript attached, and the imputations alleged to arise should also have been pleaded separately. Internet and broadcast material should be pleaded as separate causes of action, or alternatively as matters going to damages only.

36Apart from the three 13 June 2012 publications, and the separate Internet publications of these articles, all other publications in the list set out in [34] above are statute-barred. Leave should not be granted in relation to these publications. 

37Not only are the publications rolled up into one claim, but no particulars of identification or of the ""immense financial loss"" or ""loss of personal income from emotional trauma"" are provided for any of them. Any amended pleading would have to identify these matters with precision, as well as attaching all the matters complained of. Leave will not be granted to file the proposed amended pleading in its present form; each of these publications must be pleaded and particularised separately as set out in [49] below.

The trespass/breach of privacy claim

38As set out above, any claim for trespass occurring on 26 November 2009 would not be statute barred. The trespass pleadings in the first and second drafts of the statement of claim initially appeared to relate only to the 2009 broadcast, but Dr Ghosh's correspondence makes it clear she brings this claim in relation to the provision of information for an unspecified number of broadcasts as well. In her letter of 15 April 2013, Dr Ghosh has identified additional conduct amounting to trespass for the 5 March 2013 broadcast as follows:

""This distasteful and voyeuristic video [emphasis given by the plaintiff] shot illegally by Mr Adam Schuch of 67 Rapallo Avenue Surfers Paradise, using a high powered telescopic lens from a height and hundred of metres away diagonally across the canal at night and in the dark, through/above our fence, which he posted to A Current Affair (ninemsn Pty Ltd) to falsely allege that parties in our private, fenced, enclosed backyard were disturbing his family. Mr Schuch's spastic daughter, for whom his whole family receives centrelink [sic] pensions, would have had to jump on both her spastic legs to an Olympic height and use a high powered telescope lens (as Mr Schuch did) to see any nudity in our enclosed and private backyard. Channel 9/Mr Schuch breached privacy of tenants and our privacy by taking these illegal videos and posting them to Channel 9, who in turn aired them multiple times in November 2011 and even posted them on the world wide web/internet in breach of internet content guidelines."" 

39The defendants submit that the claim for trespass as pleaded does not plead material facts sufficient to establish a cause of action for trespass or to enable the defendants to know the case they have been called upon to meet. The plaintiff has been given two opportunities to provide particulars and has not done so. In particular, the plaintiff identifies the ""trespasser"" not as Channel 9 (or A Current Affair, or Ninemsn), but as the plaintiff's neighbour, Mr Schuch, who took a video ""hundreds of metres away"" and thereby breached her privacy and that of her tenants. It is clear from the plaintiff's letter providing these particulars, and from the claim as framed in the 22 March 2013 statement of claim, that this is a claim for breach of privacy and not a claim for trespass. 

40There is no recognised cause of action for breach of privacy: Maynes v Casey [2011] NSWCA 156; Sands v State of South Australia [2013] SASC 44 at [612]-[614]. References to privacy in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats (2001) 208 CLR 199 relate to the facts of that case, namely surreptitious filming of possum killing by an unknown animal welfare supporter. Complaints of surreptitious filming of alleged animal cruelty generally fall outside the categories of protected privacy even in the United States, where such a right of action exists. Specific ""Ag-Gag"" legislation has been the result (K C Adam, ""A Common-Sense Analysis of State Ag-Gag Legislation Under the First Amendment"" [2012] 45 Suffolk University Law Review 1129 - 1176 at 1130 - 1).

41In addition, the claim based on the use of Mr Schuch's film by the broadcaster does not plead facts and matters amounting to trespass. The facts pleaded cannot even amount to use of the fruits of the trespass (Lenah Game Meats at [4]), since Mr Schuch's filming of the plaintiff's home, from a vantage point hundreds of metres away, is not an act of trespass: Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor (1937) 58 CLR 479.

42These claims of trespass must be struck out pursuant to r 14.28 UCPR as hopeless. If Dr Ghosh is able to plead and particularise a claim of trespass which involves some form of entry by an individual onto her property, either on these specified dates or at any other time before the expiry of the limitation period, that would be an entirely different claim. It is not appropriate, however, to grant her leave to amend these claims given their hopeless generality.

Claim for criminal defamation

43As an addendum to the proposed statement of claim provided today, Dr Ghosh attaches a copy of s 257 Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA). Underneath this section, Dr Ghosh states ""All four defendants fit all of these criteria for ""Criminal defamation""."" 

44Section 257 is a South Australian provision: see Tobin & Sexton, Australia Defamation Law & Practice (LexisNexis) at [8097] for a brief description of this statute in relation to the framework of criminal defamation in Australia. The relevant NSW provision is s 529 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). 

45At [8003], Tobin & Sexton go on to explain the very limited circumstances in which there can be a claim brought for criminal libel:

""As at 1 January 2006 a largely uniform provision on the subject of criminal defamation was adopted by five of the Australian States, Victoria being the exception. Previously each of these jurisdictions - and the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory - had its own - somewhat differing - statutory offence of criminal libel.

...

Proceedings in criminal defamation cannot be instituted without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The commencement of criminal proceedings, however, does not prevent the commencement or determination of civil proceedings.""

46Pursuant to s 529(7) such an action cannot be commenced without the leave of the Attorney-General. This is a hopeless pleading and must be struck out.

Aggravated compensatory damages

47Matters commonly found in a pleading for aggravated compensatory damages can be found in paragraphs (i) - (v). However, in (vi), Dr Ghosh makes serious allegations about the defendants and their lawyers ranging from perjury and hiding evidence to abusing and assaulting the plaintiff outside the Newcastle Court House. The defendants submit these particulars are scandalous and should be struck out. I will not strike out the particulars of aggravated damages in paragraphs (i) - (v), but I will strike out the whole of paragraph (vi) as scandalous and as irrelevant to the issue of aggravated compensatory damages.

What leave to amend should be granted?

48The plaintiff should not be granted leave to plead any of the following:

(a)Any cause of action for defamation against NBN Limited in respect of any publication other than those within time, namely the three publications dated 13 June 2012 and those dated 5 March 2013, 22 March 2013 and 3 May 2013. The plaintiff must either plead and particularise any Internet publication as a cause of action or alternatively identify such publication(s) as going to damages only. Stayz Pty Ltd's letter of 6 March 2013 is also a cause of action upon which the plaintiff may commence proceedings.

(b)The causes of action for trespass to land/breaches to privacy.

(c)All causes of action for defamation, including those against News Limited or Gold Coast Publications Pty Ltd, identified in the second and third matters complained of in the proposed statement of claim. Each publication identified in these parts of this pleading is time-barred, and News Limited did not publish any of the alleged publications.

(d)All causes of action in the fourth matter complained of in the proposed statement of claim, except those dated 13 June 2012, 22 March 2013 and 3 May 2013.

(e)As no claim is made against Fairfax Media ACN 008 663 161, leave should not be granted to include the name of this party as the third defendant. The plaintiff's claim should be brought against Stayz Pty Ltd (ACN 102 711 599). The claim in relation to Stayz's 6 March 2013 email in the first matter complained of must be pleaded separately, with separate imputations and, if necessary, extrinsic facts.

49Any grant of leave should be conditional upon the following:

(a)The plaintiff is to annex the text of each of the matters complained of, and to identify the imputations alleged to arise in relation to each publication.

(b)Where the plaintiff is not named in each matter complained of, the plaintiff should provide particulars of the names and addresses of the persons who identified her in each such publication, and the facts and matters giving rise to such identification.

(c)Full particulars of any claim for special damages should be provided.

(d)Each of the defendants should be separately identified. As there is no case pleaded against Fairfax Media or News Limited, their names should not appear in the pleadings at all.

(e)The defendants asked for an order for verification of the pleadings by the plaintiff. I do not think that this is necessary; Dr Ghosh clearly genuinely believes she has been wronged, and there are certainly many publications which appear to refer to her real estate use by alleged partygoers. Counsel for the defendants indicated that it would be a matter for the court to determine what would be an appropriate course of action. In my view, no special order for verification is necessary, but the defendants' Notices of Motion should remain on foot, in the event that the defendants wish to bring further objections to the next version of the statement of claim.

Transfer of the action from Newcastle to the Defamation List

50The defendants argue, with some justification, that the complexities of this action require specialist list case management so that judgments explaining the issues of law can be provided to assist the plaintiff. The large number of publications, the changes to the names of the defendants and the causes of action and the series of draft pleadings have added to this complexity.

51Rule 8.2 of the UCPR permits a court to make an order changing the venue of proceedings where appropriate. Rule 45.10 provides that the court may refer proceedings to a specialist list. Practice Note DC (Civil) No. 6 envisages that actions for defamation are case-managed in the Defamation List until pleadings are closed.

52I have explained to Dr Ghosh that she can appear by telephone link when the matter is next in the Defamation List. This is more efficient than conducting a complex matter before a series of different judges in the Newcastle circuit sittings. I have accordingly made an order transferring these proceedings from the Newcastle registry to the Sydney registry Defamation List.

53Dr Ghosh also asks that proceedings 13616/10 (Ghosh v New Ltd & Ors) be transferred from the Supreme Court of Queensland to the Newcastle registry of this court. I do not have power to make such an order, and I have told her so. 

Costs

54Both the plaintiff and defendants sought costs orders in their favour in relation to this application. Dr Ghosh considered she should be entitled to costs because she is in a disadvantageous position compared to the defendants. She referred me to s 40 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW).

55Although Dr Ghosh complains that the defendants are running up costs to intimidate her, these proceedings have not been conducted unfairly in my view. There has been only one barrister appearing for all these defendants, instructed by one solicitor. The defendants have shown restraint and common sense in their approach to this complex claim and also to the redrafted pleadings handed up in court on 8 May and again today.

56Counsel for the defendants submitted her clients should be awarded costs as they had substantially succeeded. Where a claim is struck out, or leave to amend granted, the general rule is that costs follow the event: r 42.1 UCPR. I agree that this should be the case here.

57There are three additional points. First, the plaintiff's application to issue subpoenae in the Newcastle registry was premature. I have made orders setting those subpoenae aside, and explained to her the difficulties caused to courts, as well as to the parties, by the issuing of subpoenae at such an early stage of the proceedings. It would appear that some of the subpoenae issued were as a result of not appreciating that discovery is a procedure available in defamation actions. Secondly, the defendants have been successful in having about two-thirds of the 47 or more defamation actions struck out, as well as the two claims for trespass/breach of privacy. Thirdly, this application could not be dealt with on the court-appointed date (29 April 2013) because the plaintiff did not attend court, and the special fixture could not proceed on 8 May because she did not provide the necessary documents to the defendants, so the matter had to be stood over part-heard to today. 

58The defendants ask for an order that the costs payable be paid on an indemnity basis. The statement of claim must be completely redrafted and some of the extreme claims made (such as the criminal defamation claim and the aggravated damages particulars which I have struck out as scandalous) are matters of concern.

59I first note that no cause of action is pleaded in relation to News Limited or Fairfax Media, and their names should be deleted as defendants in relation to the causes of action pleaded. However, I have not made any special costs orders in this regard. This means that none of the costs orders I am making can be assessed before the end of these proceedings, unless another judge or I order otherwise, on another occasion. I have put this paragraph in my judgment to reassure Dr Ghosh on this issue. 

60I take into account that the plaintiff is a litigant in person, but I am satisfied, by reason of the matters in [57] - [58] above, that I should make an order for the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs on an indemnity basis. The maze-like structure of the successive draft statements of claim, the scandalous matters in the particulars of aggravated damages and the bringing of a claim for criminal defamation warrant the making of such an order.

61Finally, I note that the plaintiff is concerned about the degree of ongoing media coverage of her real estate, and allegations of there being party-going guests. The plaintiff is at liberty to bring any application by Notice of Motion in accordance with the orders set out below. It is not possible, due to the lateness of the hour, for such an application to be entertained today.

(1)The plaintiff's application for leave to file the proposed amended statement of claim is refused.

(2)The plaintiff is granted leave to file an amended statement of claim in relation to the following causes of action:

		21 May 2013",2013-05-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761517,R v Lockett [2013] NSWSC 859,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The four accused, Richard Barnes, Carl Brown, Samuel Lockett, and Kirk Tuivaga, are each charged with the murder of Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez (the deceased) on 12 October 2010. Bradley Trawin-Hadfield has pleaded to manslaughter. 

2An application has been made by Samuel Lockett that he be tried separately from Richard Barnes and Carl Brown.

3With no disrespect to the accused, I will for the sake of convenience refer to them by their surnames. 

An Outline of the Crown Case

4In September 2010 Brown attended the deceased's home and obtained a firearm from the deceased. Arrangements were made for Brown to pay for the firearm at a later undefined time.

5Over the next 3 weeks Brown did not pay any money to the deceased. As a result the deceased left a number of messages on Brown's phone asking for payment. 

6On the day of the offence, the four accused and Trawin-Hadfield were together at 51 Marlborough St Smithfield, where the Crown alleges TUIVAGA and BROWN were living. 

7At some stage during the day the four accused with Bradley Trawin-Hadfield drove to Jasmine Psaroudis' house at 44 Russell St Mt Pritchard, which is the house next door to the deceased's. She is Brown's sister. 

8On the way to Mt Pritchard the accused stopped at Welwyn Place Canley Vale where a gun was obtained from Trevor Hair. 

9The four accused with Bradley Trawin-Hadfield then made their way to Russell St, Mt Pritchard. 

10At about 7.30pm the same day the deceased was at his home at 42 Russell St Mt Pritchard, with his de-facto, Rhiannon Knaggs, and her friend Ashley Riddell, when Brown approached the house together with the other three co-accused and Trawin-Hadfield. Brown called out to the deceased telling him to ""come out the front and face him.""

11When the deceased walked out onto the front porch he was confronted by the accused and Trawin-Hadfield. The deceased was punched to the head by one of the males before the entire group participated in the assault either by striking the deceased or providing encouragement to those that did. 

12During this assault it is the Crown case that Lockett struck the deceased with the gun on the head. The gun discharged with the projectile hitting the deceased in the head and causing a fatal wound.

13All of the accused then ran to their car which was parked further down the road and drove away.





Matters of Evidence 

14The witnesses that the Crown intends to call include Rhiannon Knaggs, Ashley Riddell and Jasmine Psaroudis. 

15In her witness statement, Ms Knaggs describes the ""blond guy"" hitting the deceased with what she thought was an aluminium pole. She then heard a bang and saw the deceased's head explode. 

16Ashley Riddell in her witness statement says that she saw a male with sandy blond hair hit the deceased on the top of the head with what she thought was a pole, then heard a loud bang and saw that the deceased had been shot in the head. 

17It is the Crown case that Lockett is the ""blond guy"" who was seen by Ms Knaggs and Ms Riddell to strike the deceased. 

18Jasmine Psaroudis, in her witness statement describes seeing Lockett hitting the deceased over the head with ""a thing"" about 10-30cm long and made from wood, at least five times. She then recounts that she saw Lockett holding a thin silver metal tube about 30cm long with the wooden end in his hand. She says that Lockett hit the deceased with it about four times. She saw ""the thing"" in Lockett's hand bounce and move upwards and heard a loud bang. 

19On 13 October 2010, Brown entered into an electronic record of interview (ERISP). His account included that he saw Lockett hit the deceased with the gun three times before it went off. He said that Lockett had seen him with the firearm before the date of the offence. As to the ownership of the gun that had been obtained from Hain, he said that it came to Hain from Lockett. 

20Barnes entered into an electronic record of interview (ERISP) on 17 November 2010 during which he described the gun and drew a sketch of it which included a trigger. 

21On 18 November 2010, Lockett entered into an electronic record of interview (ERISP) during which he said that either Barnes or Brown had the gun in their hands and that he went to take it off them and it went off. When Brown went into the house at Mt Pritchard, Lockett described Brown coming out with ""some sort of metal pole"" that did not look like a gun. His account included that he had no idea it was a gun. 

How the Crown Intends to Present its Case

22It is the Crown case that all of the accused were involved in a joint criminal enterprise to assault the deceased intending to cause grievous bodily harm. As against Lockett, the Crown also contends that he struck the accused with the gun, with the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm and it was the deliberate act of Lockett that caused the deceased's death. 

The Application for Separate Trials

23 Where the Crown case is that the accused were parties to a joint criminal enterprise, the starting point is that they should be tried jointly, Webb v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41. In Regina v Jon Leslie Baartman (unreported, NSWCCA 6 October 1994) the Court of Criminal Appeal approved the relevant principles governing the exercise of the discretion to grant a separate trial as enunciated by Hunt J in Regina v Stephen Frederick Middis (unreported, NSWSC 27 March 1991), an approval repeated in Regina v Georgiou [1999] NSWCCA 125: ""Briefly, the relevant principles are that: 

1. Where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him; and 2. Where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him; and3. Where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material, 
a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial.""


24In Regina v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190 Adams J provides in the leading judgment some explanation of the principles enunciated in Middis:

""39. Two phrases in this summary need some explanation. In ordinary speech, ""immeasurably"" usually connotes something of such an enormous degree that it is beyond measurement. It is obvious that it was here not used in this sense. I think that his Honour meant ""significant, though incommensurable"". The starting point is that the inadmissible, prejudicial material is completely irrelevant. If, when placed on the scales, it would be likely to turn a potential acquittal to a conviction then this would, I think, amount to ""positive injustice"". Of course, the likelihood cannot be measured: if it is real, as distinct from inconsequential, having regard both to its inherent character and the context of the Crown case, then the trial must necessarily embarrass the affected accused. The question then arises whether the risk that the material might be placed by the jury on the scales is such that the trial miscarried. It should also be noted that Hunt J necessarily assumed that clear and emphatic directions would be given to the jury that the inadmissible material must be ignored and the point made by the summary is that, in the posited circumstances, such directions may well be insufficient to avoid a miscarriage and separate trials should be ordered to prevent such an occurrence.

40. I interpolate that, with unfeigned respect, I am doubtful that the weakness of the applicant's case as compared with that of the co-accused against whom it is proposed to tender the prejudicial evidence can be a relevant consideration. Assume that the case against the co-accused was much weaker than the applicant, even with the prejudicial evidence. If there was such a significant risk that the prejudicial evidence could be used by the jury adversely to the applicant and that evidence was itself significantly prejudicial, I am unable to see why the mere fact that it was adduced in a weaker co-offender's case is material. Indeed, the opposite would seem to be the case since, if the co-accused's case was weak, or weaker than the applicant's, the prejudicial evidence might well assume even more importance than otherwise. As it seems to me, with respect, the crucial issue is the potential effect of the inadmissible evidence on the jury's consideration of the applicant's case.""


25It follows that an applicant for a separate trial must demonstrate that there is a real risk that a positive injustice could be caused to him in a joint trial. 

26Mr Smith submits that the combined effect of the ERISPs' of Brown and Barnes will be to introduce evidence that Lockett knew that the object with which he struck the deceased was a firearm. Mr Smith pointed out that the Crown witnesses did not describe a firearm, but referred to an aluminium pole or a pole with a small handle and a long end. Mr Smith contended that what was said by Brown and Barnes would go to the scope of the joint criminal enterprise, in particular as to the extent of violence that Lockett contemplated. 

27Mr Smith pointed to the ""colourful description"" given by Brown in his ERISP particularly at Q & A 405 that he saw Lockett hit the deceased three times with the firearm. He submitted that Jasmine Psaroudis' account that Lockett hit the deceased multiple times would be supported by Brown's evidence which was inadmissible as against Lockett. 

28Mr Crown contended that the evidence of Ms Psaroudis will have to be judged by where she was when she gave her account, whereas Ms Knaggs who saw Lockett strike the deceased once, was standing directly in front of the struggle. He argued that the sketches of the guns do not advance the Crown case at all. Mr Crown's submission was that the degree of prejudice did not warrant a separate trial. 

29The admissions made by Barnes and Brown strengthen the Crown case against Lockett. They provide evidence that before Lockett went with the other accused to 42 Russell Street, he knew that there was a gun. Furthermore that Lockett knew that when he struck the deceased that he was striking him with a gun. This evidence is otherwise absent from the Crown case and is highly prejudicial to Lockett although not admissible against him. The Crown case is made significantly stronger by reason of this prejudicial material. 

30Further prejudice arises from Brown's description of the manner in which and number of times he says that Lockett struck the deceased. His account supports the testimony of his sister, the only Crown witness who saw Lockett strike the deceased more than once. In a joint trial, it is likely that Brown will put to the jury that his sister's evidence should be accepted. I do not think that clear and emphatic directions that Brown's ERISP is only admissible against Brown and Barnes' ERISP is only admissible against Barnes will be sufficient to avoid a miscarriage of justice. 

31The risk of a positive injustice is further enhanced by Senior Constable Mannah's evidence of the conversation that he had with Brown which includes ""[m]y mate already had the thing on him. He hit him in the face with it and it just went off...""

32I conclude that Lockett has demonstrated that there is a real risk that a positive injustice will be caused to him in a joint trial with Barnes and Brown. I order that Lockett be tried separately.

		27 June 2013",2013-05-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761523,R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661,"Judgment

1The accused, Roger Dean, applies for a trial by judge alone pursuant to s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 by way of notice of motion and supporting affidavit filed on 29 April 2013. The application is opposed by the Crown, although to the extent that the accused requires leave to make the application, leave is not opposed.

2The accused is charged with 11 counts of murder and 8 counts of recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm arising out of the setting of a fire at the nursing home where he worked on 18 November 2011. An additional charge of recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm is charged in the alternative to a murder count. The trial is to commence on 27 May 2013.

3Much of the Crown case is not in dispute. It is anticipated that the accused will make formal admissions pursuant to s 184 of the Evidence Act 1995 to the following facts.

4The accused was employed between May 1997 and July 2007 as a registered nurse in various nursing positions with New South Wales Health. He commenced employment at the Quakers Hill nursing home as a registered nurse in September 2011. He worked night shifts on Wednesday and Thursday nights.

5The nursing home is an aged care facility catering for high care residents requiring full assistance with daily living activities. The home consists of 35 separate rooms each containing a number of beds. The building is a large ""H"" shape and divided into two wings, A wing and B wing. Those wings were further divided into four sections, namely A1, A2, B1 and B2. The rooms in sections A1 (8 rooms), B1 (6 rooms) and most of B2 (6 rooms) each contained four beds. One room in B2 was a double room. A2 has a mix of single (8) and double (2) rooms, As at 18 November 2011 there were 89 residents.

6The external doors including the main entrance to the nursing home were kept closed. Admission required a pin number entry on a keypad. The day code was available to staff and some relatives. At 8 pm each night, the code changed for security reasons and the night code was available only to members of staff.

7There were 16 CCTV cameras installed internally and externally around the nursing home. The cameras were motion activated and on each occasion that the camera was activated or deactivated, the time was recorded on the CCTV hard drive.

8In the event of fire and within 15 seconds of the installed thermal or smoke detectors being activated, the fire alarm system would send a message via telephone lines to the contracted security firm and the emergency services. Simultaneously it caused the fire doors to close. The fire doors separated the nursing home into five zones, namely the central foyer area and the four wings. The fire doors did not lock and access could be gained through them by pushing them after which they would automatically swing closed.

9On 6 September 2011 a fire station officer delivered a training course entitled ""Fire Safety in Healthcare Facilities"" to staff at the nursing home. The accused attended that course which included a walk around the nursing home indicating the location of all installed fire fighting equipment and the fire and smoke doors, as well as the differences between them and how they function. There was also an explanation as to the purpose of the fire indicator panel and the emergency warning system.

10The drugs of addiction known as Schedule 8 drugs (S8) were stored and dispensed in accordance with strict protocols. The S8 drugs were stored in the treatment room in the central part of B wing between B1 and B2. The room was not used as a treatment room and the door was kept locked. The S8 drugs were kept in a locked cupboard. The door to the room could only be opened by a key on a blue lanyard while the cupboard could only be opened by a key on a red lanyard. The night shift registered nurse was in possession of both keys, but the protocol required both the registered nurse and an assistant nurse to be present in order to dispense the S8 drugs. Each time an S8 drug was dispensed, a drug register kept for that purpose was completed with the details of the patient's name, the date, the time, the type of drug and the quantity. Both the registered nurse and the assistant nurse who were booking out the S8 drugs were required to sign the drug register. Each day the two registered nurses on the afternoon shift were required to conduct an audit of those drugs.

11At about 8pm on 16 November 2011, an audit of the S8 drugs was carried out by the nursing staff on duty. All drugs were accounted for.

12The accused was in charge of the night shift on the nights of 16 to 17 November and 17 to 18 November 2011. On 16 November 2011, the accused started his shift at 10:30pm. Between that time and the end of his shift at 7 am on 17 November, the accused stole 237 Endone tablets and one Kapanol tablet from the treatment room. Both were S8 drugs that were commonly used as pain medication. During the shift, the accused left a note for the facility manager, offering to provide staff clinical supervision sessions to more junior staff.

13On 17 November 2011 at about 7:30 pm the nursing staff conducting the audit of the S8 medications discovered that medication was missing. The clinical manager was contacted. She travelled to the nursing home and conducted a re-audit of the S8 drugs, confirming the missing drugs. At about 10 pm she rang the Quakers Hill police station to report the theft of the drugs.

14At 10:23 pm on 17 November the accused started his shift. During the briefing on the handover of the shift, the accused was told of the missing drugs. Shortly after midnight, two police officers attended the nursing home and were met by the accused who took them to the manager's office in the central administration area.

15The police commenced a preliminary investigation into the theft of the drugs but left after 17 minutes in order to attend to an unrelated urgent incident.

16The clinical manager left the nursing home at 3:43 am, leaving the manager's office locked. There were only two keys to the manager's office, one kept by the clinical manager and the other kept by the facility manager. The paper and computer records relating to the theft and the complaints to police were inside the manager's office. It remained locked until it was opened by a police officer after the fire.

17Shortly after 4:53 am, the accused set fire to a bed in room 19 in A2 wing using a cigarette lighter which had been left in the kitchen by a staff member. At 4:53 am the fire sensors detected the fire in room 19 and activated the alarm. The alarm caused the siren to activate within the nursing home and an automatic message was sent to the Fire Brigade. All the fire doors throughout the nursing home closed and activated the fire alarm panel in the foyer.

18As the fire door closed, the accused walked from A2 wing towards the A1 wing entrance. Between 4:53 am and 5:02 am the accused lit a second fire on the sheet of an unoccupied bed in room 3 in A1 wing, using the same cigarette lighter. Two occupants of this room were immobile and incapable of moving from their beds without assistance. The accused then disposed of the cigarette lighter in a sanitary bin in the A1 wing bathroom.

19At 4:59 am the first Fire Brigade officers arrived at the nursing home. The officers were directed by staff to the fire in room 19 in A2 wing. They extinguished that fire.

20Meanwhile, a resident in room 4 of A wing walked to the door of her room that leads to the hallway on hearing the fire alarm. The patient could not see or smell smoke so she returned to her bed. The accused came to her and said ""Come on darling, we've got to get out, we've got to evacuate."" The patient objected but the accused started to walk her from the room and up the hallway towards the front door. The patient looked into room 3 where the second fire lit by the accused had taken hold in an unoccupied bed. The patient broke free from the accused and ran into the room saying ""We've got to get them out, we've got to get them out."" The accused grabbed her and started moving her from the room saying ""Don't worry Helen just leave them. We've got to get out. People are on their way to get them.""

21At 5:02 am the accused came out of A1 wing. He then moved between the A wing foyer and B wing. In B wing he assisted in the evacuation of some of the residents. He did not tell any Fire Brigade officer or anyone else of the second fire that he had lit in A1 wing.

22At 5:08 am the accused was outside the front entrance doors being directed by firemen to move away from the entrance area. Over the next 10 minutes he remained outside, moving residents away from the entrance to the building.

23At 5:15 am Fire Brigade officers discovered the second fire which was already partially breaching the roof of the nursing home. It had been burning for at least 13 minutes.

24Between 5:20 am and 6:10 am, the accused made three concerted efforts to enter the nursing home through the front doors. On each occasion he was rebuffed by a Fire Brigade officer or police officer. On the last occasion the accused said to a Fire Brigade officer ""I need to go inside to get the drug books, I need to get in there."" The accused showed a Fire Brigade officer the two lanyards that operated locks to the treatment room and the cabinet. The accused was given permission to enter the building and retrieve the drug books.

25The accused accompanied two fire fighters into the building and went with them to the treatment room. He gave the keys to one of the officers, explained the location of the cabinet and described the two books. He said ""We need them. We need to get these out.""

26The accused remained in the corridor away from the treatment room and outside the scope of the CCTV cameras. When the Fire officers were unable to open the door they invited the accused to assist. The accused appeared reluctant and complained that he was an asthmatic. He ultimately approached and unlocked the door to the treatment room, entered the room and unlocked the S8 drug cabinet. He removed two drug register books, put them into a yellow shoulder bag and left the building. He said ""I need to go home, I need to get Ventolin. I live close by and I really need my Ventolin.""

27As the accused was leaving the nursing home, a reporter ran in front of the accused and began filming him. He asked what was happening. Other cameramen came over and there followed a brief interview. In part the accused said ""Hi, I am Roger, I am one of the nurses, just there was a fire and I just quickly just did what I can get everyone out and the smoke is just overwhelming, but we got a lot of people out so that's the main thing."" In this interview, the accused is coherent, alert and responsive.

28The accused then travelled on foot to his home in xxxxxxxxx. The accused tore up the two S8 registers, placed the remains in a grey plastic shopping bag and then was driven by his flatmate to the vicinity of Douglas Road Quakers Hill. The accused formerly worked at the cheesecake shop in Douglas Road, operated by the accused's flatmate, Mr French. The accused disposed of the grey plastic shopping bag and its contents in a dumpster bin and then returned to the nursing home.

29At about noon, the accused was taken by ambulance to Mt Druitt Hospital. His condition was noted as ""presented with sooty residue on his face and clothes, pale skin, and generally distressed.""

30At about 2 pm the accused was taken from Mt Druitt Hospital to Mt Druitt police station where he made a written statement. In that statement he described his movements throughout the evening but made no admissions. At about 7:15 pm he was told by police that he was regarded as a suspect.

31Between 6:47 pm and 8:15 pm the accused made a number of calls and sent a number of text messages that were intercepted pursuant to a warrant. In those calls the accused spoke to Mr French and informed him of the police investigation and the fact that he was regarded as a suspect.

32Shortly after 7:50 pm the accused was arrested and cautioned. At 9:50 pm the accused entered into a record of interview in which he admitted lighting the fires. The interview extends over two hours and consists of about 350 questions. The accused provided lucid, rationale responses to all of these questions, including informing the police that he had taken an antidepressant, an antacid and a blood pressure tablet just before the interview. The accused agreed that he had requested to speak to two friends before the interview, that he had been given that opportunity and that he understood that he was under no obligation to speak further with police. 

33The accused provided a quite detailed account of his movements throughout the night and the order of events. He was provided with a map of the nursing home and indicated the rooms on the map where he lit the fires. His explanation for lighting the fires was that he had been having quite severe nightmares, he had been suffering from depression for two years and he had attempted suicide ""by taking a lot of medication all at once"". He had turned to the church and he believed that Satan had urged him to light the fires.

34The accused was asked what medications he had taken. He nominated Aropax, then Lovan and Seroquel. He said he had only been taking Lovan before the night of the fires. He provided the name of his treating doctor.

35He did not think either of the fires would burn out of control and he made no attempt to extinguish them. He described the lighter and how he came to take it from the kitchen and place it in his left pocket. He agreed that he knew of the missing drugs. The accused denied that he had lit the fires in retaliation for dissatisfaction on the part of some staff members over the accused's method of distributing medication. 

36Notwithstanding the content of the police interview, the accused now admits that his intention in lighting the fires was to create a distraction to deflect management from further enquiring into the theft of the medication. Moreover, the accused now maintains that he only thought to retrieve the S8 registers from the treatment room after the attendance of the fire fighters and that he destroyed the registers to remove evidence of the missing drugs.

The Issues at Trial

37The Crown case on the murder counts rests on proof of the accused's reckless indifference to human life at the time of lighting the fires and more particularly, at the time of lighting the second fire. The deaths of the victims primarily occurred as a result of the second fire being lit in a ward where the patients were immobile, coupled with the fact that there was a delay of about 13 minutes before it was discovered. 

38The circumstances of one of the deaths gives rise to an issue of causation. Two medical practitioners will give evidence at trial directed to that issue.

39Proof that the accused foresaw or realised that lighting the fires would probably cause the death of the deceased but that he did so regardless of that consequence, depends upon the drawing of that inference from a consideration of the accused's conduct before, during and after the lighting of the fires. The Crown contends that that is the only reasonable inference that is available when one has regard to the accused's words, deeds and omissions, from the time of his arrival to commence his shift until the end of the police interview.

40The defence seeks to undermine that inference by reliance upon, in particular, the evidence of a consultant pharmacologist, Professor Christie, to whom the accused has provided instructions concerning his consumption of medication in the days, weeks and months preceding 18 November 2011. In short, the accused contends that the quantity and type of medication he ingested precluded any foresight on his part of the probability of death arising out of the acts of lighting the fires.

41The accused's instructions provided to this expert witness assert that the accused only came to appreciate what he had done as he recovered in prison from the effects of the ingestion of pharmaceuticals.

42It is not necessary or practicable to review the whole of the expert opinion of Professor Christie for the purposes of this application. His report (dated 15 January 2013) and 35 pages of instructions from the accused with respect to the type and quantity of pharmaceuticals he regularly ingested (dated 20 September 2012) are Annexures ""A"" and ""B"" respectively to the affidavit in support of the notice of motion. 

43It is relevant to note that Prof Christie observes that the accused appears to have been prescribed various psychoactive medications for bipolar disorder, both to stabilise mood and relieve depression, anxiety disorder and insomnia, and that the accused believed he was addicted to benzodiazepines, antidepressants and opioids. Prof Christie describes the accused's ""pattern of prescription and consumption of a large range sedatives benzodiazepines and related drugs, sedative antihistamines, opioids and antidepressants prior to and shortly before the fire [as] remarkable in its diversity, the high doses and potential functional drug interactions that may have affected his reasoning and normal function during that time.""

44Prof Christie goes on to discuss the effects of benzodiazepines (and other closely related drugs), other sedatives, opioids, anticonvulsants, anti-psychotics and antidepressants. 

45Most relevantly, Prof Christie opines that ""it is very likely that consumption of these drugs alone (namely, very large doses of benzodiazepines, zolpidem and other sedatives during 17 November) would have diminished his clarity of thought and insight into the significance of his actions. These drugs were combined with a very large dose of opioids which might have, if anything, exacerbated the sedative and cognitive impairing effects of the sedative drugs he consumed. [The accused] also consumed larger than usual doses of antidepressants and mixed several classes of these drugs together that may have interacted adversely with zolpidem or produced distorted ideation themselves. He also consumed large doses of anti-cholinergic drugs (sedative antihistamines, clomipriamine and mebeverine) sufficient to produce a high likelihood of disturbed reasoning and memory. These drugs alone or in combination with the other medications may also have triggered hallucinations or delusional thinking."" This opinion is qualified to the extent that Prof Christie cannot rule out the effects of tolerance to these drugs.

46In response to this proposed evidence, the Crown has provided a report under the hand of Judith Perl, forensic pharmacologist, dated 9 May 2013. Dr Perl agrees with Prof Christie's account of the potential effects of the ingested drugs and the development of tolerance to excessive use of some of those drugs. Furthermore, she agrees that many of the drugs ingested could very likely diminish clarity of thought and insight. The point of departure resides in Dr Perl's view that the quantity and type of drugs said to have been ingested by the accused would lead to a fatal outcome (notwithstanding any tolerance) or at the least, there would have been such a profound impairment of his cognitive and motor functions that one would expect to see some overt signs of significant intoxication on the CCTV footage taken from the nursing home, the accused's interview by the press and his later interview with police. 

47In the light of no significant symptoms of cognitive or physical impairment in the course of the accused's activities over 17 and 18 November, and in the light of no obvious impairment of cognitive or motor functions or obvious signs of significant benzodiazepine and opiod withdrawal in police custody records and Justice Health records, Dr Perl disputes that there was any medication or drug use of the order claimed by the accused that could have diminished his cognitive functions to the extent that his reasoning and insight would have been impaired.

48A further report under the hand of Dr Michael Diamond, consultant psychiatrist, dated 13 May 2013 notes that ""the quantity of medication purported to have been consumed is not consistent with the observable (visual records) or the witness statements about the accused"" at the relevant times. Dr Diamond observes that the accused's interview with police shows ""purposeful, rational, attentive, considered interaction in the course of an interview lasting over 90 min"". The account of medications taken, both in quantity and in type, is considered inaccurate on the basis that the accused was capable of conducting himself appropriately, forming judgments and interpreting his environment without any significant impairment to his mental functioning.

49It is tolerably clear from these competing reports that a significant factual issue at trial will be the truth and accuracy of the accused's instructions to his legal representatives concerning the extent of his abuse of pharmaceutical drugs. 

The Basis of the Application

50The affidavit in support of the application submits that ""much of the evidence is of a highly technical nature and is therefore appropriate for trial by judge alone. "" It is further submitted that the determination of the issue of foresight of the probability of death does not call for the application of objective community standards such as reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.

51On the hearing of the application the basis was somewhat broadened by the Senior Public Defender. It was submitted that when the highly technical nature of the expert evidence is combined with the natural prejudice arising out of the deaths of 11 elderly people in a nursing home, the interests of justice required trial by judge alone.

Consideration

52The overriding consideration in determining the application is whether it is in the interests of justice to grant it. There is no onus, other than evidentiary, upon the accused to justify the grant of a separate trial : R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86.

53The legislation stipulates some grounds for refusal, namely, where the trial involves factual issues that require the application of objective community standards, including such standards as reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness. These are by no means exhaustive. 

54What is in the interests of justice in any given case does not readily lend itself to definition. At the very least, it involves the facts and circumstances giving rise to the charges, the nature of the charges, the complexity and number of issues at trial, and the interests of the accused and the Crown in a trial conducted according to law.

55In R v King [2013] NSWSC 448, Justice Bellew was confronted with an application for trial by judge alone in somewhat similar circumstances to the present case. The accused's capacity to form an intention to kill while under the influence of methylamphetamine and alcohol was the subject of expert pharmacological evidence. That opinion was contrasted with the objective evidence of the accused's conduct before and during the act causing death (beating, kicking and stomping the deceased). The primary basis of the application before Bellew J was that the issue of the accused's intention did not involve the application of objective community standards.

56In response to that submission, his Honour said :-

52 In determining whether there is an issue which requires the application of an objective community standard, the circumstances of the particular trial must be taken into account. The various matters to which I have referred all combine to form part of the circumstances in which the Crown will submit that the accused killed the deceased, intending to kill her, or intending to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her. Viewed in that way, the circumstances of the case put by the Crown, and the issue of intention in particular, will attract the application of objective community standards in the sense contemplated by Heydon J. In particular, the jury will be asked to have recourse to their shared values about the circumstances in which the accused's actions occurred, as well as the implications of those actions. In my view, the fact that in Belghar the issue was one of intention, and the fact that McClellan CJ at CL observed (at [100]) that such issue did not, in the circumstances of that case, require the application of community standards, does not lead to the conclusion that this will always be the case when an issue of intention is raised. 

57The reference to Heydon J arises out of the decision of AK v The State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 8. At [95], Justice Heydon includes intention among those concepts that call for the application of objective community standards, on the basis that ""shared values and assumptions about the implications of actions and the circumstances in which those actions occur may be a safer guide to culpability"" than an analysis of the meaning of intention : see Buxton, ""Some Simple Thoughts on Intention"", [1988] Criminal Law Review 484 at 495. 

58The Crown in King relied upon this aspect of Heydon J's judgment and the Crown relies upon it here. It is right to acknowledge that Justice Heydon's observation in this respect was not endorsed by any other member of that bench and that McClellan CJ at CL accepted that the issue of intention did not involve the application of community standards in the circumstances applying in Belghar. Like Bellew J, I am not persuaded that the issue of intention can never involve the application of objective community standards. I also note that the basis of the decision in Belghar was that the trial judge determined the application in the absence of appropriate evidence and without considering whether such prejudice as was found to exist could be neutralised by directions.

59The more compelling feature of the instant case is that the critical factual dispute relating to the extent of the accused's ingestion of drugs must be resolved to a large extent by an assessment of the accused's credibility and reliability. It is axiomatic that the accused will have to provide evidence of the scope of his drug-taking in order to ground the expert opinions. In that regard, the observations of Lord Devlin, to whom Heydon J referred in AK v The State of Western Australia at [94] bear repeating :- 

[T]he jury is the best instrument for deciding upon the credibility or reliability of a witness and so for determining the primary facts. Whether a person is telling the truth, when it has to be judged, as so often it has, simply from the demeanour of the witness and his manner of telling it, is a matter about which it is easy for a single mind to be fallible. The impression that a witness makes depends upon reception as well as transmission and may be affected by the idiosyncrasies of the receiving mind; the impression made upon a mind of twelve is more reliable. Moreover, the judge, who naturally by his training regards so much as simple that to the ordinary man may be difficult, may fail to make enough allowance for the behaviour of the stupid. The jury hear the witness as one who is as ignorant as they are of lawyers' ways of thought; that is the great advantage to a man of judgment by his peers.

60Assuming that the accused's account at trial is rejected out of hand or that it is partially accepted, there is nonetheless evidence of the ingestion of some medications by the accused (for example, in the interview with police and from his flatmate) which call for expert pharmacological and psychiatric evidence. Disregarding for present purposes how that factual dispute is resolved, I would not embrace the description of the pharmacological evidence as ""highly technical"". I accept that it may be complex, in the sense that there are many drugs, the effects of which vary with dosage, frequency of use and their interaction with each other. However, the preparation of a schedule which lists each drug by name, identifies its active ingredient, its therapeutic purpose, the dosage and frequency reported by the accused, and the anticipated effects of that ingestion may go a long way towards aiding a jury's comprehension of that evidence. 

61Providing aids towards juror comprehension is part and parcel of trial by jury. It allows the wider community to appreciate the basis of a verdict and thereby accept the result. The Crown points to the importance of the participation by the community at large, through the selection of a jury at random from their midst, in the administration of criminal justice in this State. That participation is generally in the interests of justice, in the sense explained by Deane J in Kingswell v The Queen [1985] HCA 72 ; 159 CLR 264 at 301 :-

51. Trial by jury also brings important practical benefits to the administration of criminal justice. A system of criminal law cannot be attuned to the needs of the people whom it exists to serve unless its administration, proceedings and judgments are comprehensible by both the accused and the general public and have the appearance, as well as the substance, of being impartial and just. In a legal system where the question of criminal guilt is determined by a jury of ordinary citizens, the participating lawyers are constrained to present the evidence and issues in a manner that can be understood by laymen. The result is that the accused and the public can follow and understand the proceedings. Equally important, the presence and function of a jury in a criminal trial and the well-known tendency of jurors to identify and side with a fellow-citizen who is, in their view, being denied a ""fair go"" tend to ensure observance of the consideration and respect to which ordinary notions of fair play entitle an accused or a witness. Few lawyers with practical experience in criminal matters would deny the importance of the institution of the jury to the maintenance of the appearance, as well as the substance, of impartial justice in criminal cases (cf. Knittel and Seiler, ""The Merits of Trial by Jury"", Cambridge Law Journal, vol. 30 (1972), 316 at pp.320-321). 


52. The institution of trial by jury also serves the function of protecting both the administration of justice and the accused from the rash judgment and prejudices of the community itself. The nature of the jury as a body of ordinary citizens called from the community to try the particular case offers some assurance that the community as a whole will be more likely to accept a jury's verdict than it would be to accept the judgment of a judge or magistrate who might be, or be portrayed as being, over-responsive to authority or remote from the affairs and concerns of ordinary people. The random selection of a jury panel, the empanelment of a jury to try the particular case, the public anonymity of individual jurors, the ordinary confidentiality of the jury's deliberative processes, ............ and the insistence upon its function of determining the particular charge according to the evidence combine, for so long as they can be preserved or observed, to offer some assurance that the accused will not be judged by reference to sensational or self-righteous pre-trial publicity or the passions of the mob. 

62Deane J went on to note that ""contemporary circumstances have raised new questions about, and placed additional strains upon, the institution of the criminal trial by jury."" His Honour accepted that there were areas of scientific and technical knowledge that ordinary members of the community may find challenging, although these comments were made in the context of the jury being deprived (as was then the case) of the transcript of evidence. Those reservations are neutralised to some extent by the provision of the transcript of expert evidence to juries. 

63I do not regard the nature of the expert evidence in this case as so technical that it is beyond the appreciation of a jury or that its complexity would give rise to the risk that a properly instructed jury might fail to engage with the matters under discussion. 

64It remains to consider whether the expert evidence in combination with the natural prejudice occasioned by the trial of the accused on 11 counts of murder warrants a judge alone trial. 

65Unfortunately, trials for multiple murders are not unknown to the administration of criminal justice. Notorious trials such as that relating to the murder of 7 young tourists by Ivan Milat (R v Milat NSWCCA 26 February 1998) in circumstances far more heinous than the instant case have been conducted before a jury. It is accepted by the common law that juries follow instructions from the trial judge that impress upon them the importance of deciding the matter on the evidence in the trial and putting to one side any emotional responses they may have. Robust and repeated instructions to the jury panel that invite any prospective juror to disqualify himself or herself from the panel if unable to put prejudices aside are capable of markedly reducing the risk of bias.

66Moreover, the deaths of the victims in this case were not the product of a direct, deliberate and malicious assault upon them. The opprobrium towards an accused in those circumstances must naturally be greater than that engendered by a number of deaths indirectly brought about by the actions of the accused. 

67It follows that the broader basis of the application also fails.

68Leave is granted to make the application out of time. The notice of motion is dismissed.

		29 May 2013",2013-05-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761531,R v Keith Harold ALLEN [2013] NSWSC 614,"Judgment
Introduction
1Mr Todd Sutton was killed on 4 December 2010.  Mr Keith Allen was charged with his murder, to which he pleaded not guilty.  Because of Mr Allen's precarious health (he is receiving palliative care for lung cancer) I acceded to the defence application to dispense with a jury and Mr Allen's trial was conducted before me sitting alone.  On 14 May 2013 I found him not guilty and acquitted him, stating that I would give my reasons at a later time.  These are those reasons. 
2Mr Sutton was shot twice, first to the shoulder and then to the head.  Mr Allen fired the first shot when Mr Sutton was holding his partner Ms A with a knife to her throat, threatening to kill her.  He was charged with murdering Mr Sutton because it is alleged that the second shot was not fired in defence of Ms A but when Mr Sutton had dropped the knife and was no longer a threat.  In the alternative, the Crown alleges that, even if the second shot was fired because Mr Allen thought it was necessary to defend Ms A, that belief was objectively unreasonable and, accordingly, he is guilty of manslaughter.
3The eyewitnesses to the relevant events were Ms A, her then 10 year old daughter B and Mr Allen.  The first two gave evidence Mr Allen's two interviews with police - at the police station in the early hours of 5 December 2010 and then during a walk through at about 1pm that afternoon - were tendered.  He did not give evidence.  During her evidence, Ms A adopted as truthful and reliable what she told the police during a walk-through at about 3pm on the afternoon of 5 December 2010.  B's evidence in chief comprised her initial interview with police starting just after midnight on 5 December 2010 and a subsequent interview on the afternoon of 17 December 2010.  She was briefly cross-examined.
4Ms A (in her early forties) and Mr Sutton (in his mid thirties and of robust build), were in a relationship.  Ms A lived with B who was the child of a previous relationship with a Mr C on Ms A's property of about 300 acres, where she kept greyhounds.  Mr Sutton lived in Sydney during the week, returning to the property on weekends.  Mr Allen lived in a caravan on the property and helped take care of the dogs.  He was a friend of Mr C.  Mr Sutton was about 20 centimetres taller than Ms A.  Mr Allen was 70 years of age and much smaller and more lightly built than Mr Sutton.  He was also partially deaf.
Autopsy 
5The autopsy report which was tendered in the trial identifies the direct cause of death as gun shot injury of the head.  Mr Sutton had also suffered a gun shot injury to his left shoulder.  That wound involved only soft tissue and a broken clavicle but no vital structures such as major blood vessels or airways.  There was some damage to the nerves on the left side of the neck which would generally be expected to cause some incapacitation of the functions of the left arm.  It was not possible to determine the sequence in which the gun shot injuries were inflicted but other evidence establishes beyond doubt that the head wound was the second injury.  It is perhaps worth mentioning that a few minor bruises and abrasions were found on the upper limbs and left lower limb which were likely to have occurred during falls and/or a scuffle.  Of some significance to my mind is the fact that Mr Sutton had a blood alcohol reading of 0.173 grams per 100 millilitres and, in the vitreus humour 0.195 grams per 100 millilitres.  Dr Samarasinghe informed the Court that the latter reading was more likely to be accurate as it was less likely to be affected by post-mortem changes.  He said, as is obvious at all events, that these alcohol levels were in the moderate to heavy range for intoxication.  
6Of some significance were the entry angles of the bullets.  So far as the shoulder wound is concerned, the overall direction of the bullet track is left to right and slightly upward, the doctor thought approximately 30 degrees, plus or minus 10 degrees.  A part of the difficulty with accurately describing the entry path is that when the bullet impacted on the clavicle it shattered into pieces and was, of course, deflected.  The problem is somewhat less so far as the head wound is concerned since it is possible to mark the line between the point of entry and the other side of the skull where the bullet struck before ricocheting within the skull.  Of course, the brain is soft material and therefore would not have deflected the bullet.  However, Dr Samarasinghe pointed out that, as a forensic pathologist, he could only describe the direction of the bullet inside the body and did not have an opinion as to the angle which the bullet struck the skull, that is to say, whether it was, to some degree or other, deflected by the skull.  The internal examination showed the gun shot wound track extended within the head approximately 43 degrees backwards, slightly downwards and in a right to left direction.  The position of the wound was on the right forehead 3.5 centimetres above the outer reach of the right eyebrow and 8 centimetres from and 3.5 centimetres above the right ear opening.  It is obvious that the injury from this wound would have caused almost immediate unconsciousness and death.
The scene   
7The property where Mr Sutton died is about 300 acres, close to a square in shape with its northern boundary running along a gravel road.  A gravel driveway, with a gate at the road, travels south up a slight incline along the side of the homestead which is about 30 metres from the gate with the main entrance facing the road.  Going up the driveway past the house on the right hand side is a concrete slab going off to the left, the nearest edge to the northern boundary being some 43 metres from the gate.  It was on the eastern part of this rectangular slab (about 6 metres by 11 metres) that the body of Mr Sutton was found.  It can be accepted that it is here that he fell after being shot in the head and that his body was not moved until after police arrived.  The body was lying with the head towards the road and the feet pointing more or less south.  It was slightly diagonal with the feet some little distance further from the eastern edge of the slab than the head.  The distance between Mr Sutton's head and the gate was about 47 metres.  The slab was used for the purpose of parking vehicles.  On the evening in question two motor vehicles were parked on it, near the centre and to the west, so that as one faced the slab looking towards the house, they were on the left half.  
8The concrete slab, though set in the earth, was raised somewhat at its eastern end, the ground sloping gently down in that direction, so that the slab was horizontal. 
9Moving south along the easterly side of the slab, is firstly a large gravel area of irregular shape about ten metres wide forming the southern end of the driveway which goes down to the gate onto the road.  Following the line of the western edge of the slab, about five metres past the driveway was a table next to a pumpkin patch about four metres in diameter.  Moving south about two or three metres, was a van parked next to a caravan which was used by Mr Allen.  
Late afternoon of 4 December 2010
10When Ms A gave her evidence, she was very distressed and obviously had difficulties with recollection both for this reason and because the circumstances were, I am satisfied, terrifying.  She believed, and reasonably so, that she might be killed, or at least very seriously injured.  During her evidence she adopted the walkthrough interview that was conducted with police on 5 December 2010.  Although obviously upset at times, and walking with difficulty because of a painful neck which resulted from being manhandled on the previous evening, she was much calmer than when she gave evidence.  She said that her memory would have been better than it was at trial.  To some degree her accounts truncate events, especially those that occurred earlier.  
11I am quite satisfied Ms A was being honest and doing her best to be accurate about important matters.  In some respects she has confused events but I do not regard this as adversely affecting the essential reliability of her description of what occurred from the time that Mr Sutton grabbed her and put the knife to her throat.  The following narrative is an amalgam of her evidence and what she said in the walk-through.  They differ to some, occasionally substantial, degree but this is not important in the circumstances.  
12During the day, Mr Allen, Ms A, and Mr Sutton did some work around the property.  B was there as well.  When Ms A went in to cook the evening meal she needed some supplies and asked Mr Sutton to get them from a nearby shop.  He went with B in his car and was gone perhaps 15 or 20 minutes.  When he returned he remained outside working with the dogs.   When Ms A had prepared dinner she called Mr Sutton but he did not come in to eat.  She, B and Mr Allen started to eat their meal whilst Mr Sutton was outside.  When he came in he was angry because they had eaten dinner without him.  Mr Sutton had been drinking through the day and was significantly affected by alcohol.  Neither Ms A nor Mr Allen were affected by alcohol.  When Mr Sutton came in to eat his meal B was dancing and preparing for an audition for TV advertisements for which she had been rehearsing for some little time.  Mr Sutton was angry at this.  (B does not mention this and her account of the exchanges at this time is inconsistent with it occurring.  However, I am satisfied that Ms A's account - given in the walk-through when she showed police four of B's costumes - is reliable on this point.)  According to Ms A, Mr Allen then said, ""I'm out of here, I've had enough"" and went outside.  
13Ms A said that she started to wash up and clean around the kitchen when B came running in and told her that ""Todd's yelling at Keith"" and ""to go out and see what was going on"".   When she went outside Mr Sutton was yelling and screaming obscenities and she told him, ""Pack your stuff and get out.  I've had enough.  Go.  Please leave"" but he ignored her.  Mr Sutton was throwing large rocks at Mr Allen.  She said, ""He was yelling abuse and just he went psycho, he just lost the plot - he was just going mental.""   She approached Mr Sutton.  He had picked up a ""blockbuster"" (like a blunt axe used to split timber which had been leaning up against a nearby rock pile), and started swinging it at her.  B was shouting at her to get away from him.  She thought it would have hurt her very badly if she had not moved away.  Mr Allen was saying, ""Mate get out, just get in your car and go"".   The blockbuster was put down somewhere but she was not sure where.  Mr Sutton pushed her over and then ""come at me"".  She told him to get away, and then ran inside the house chased by him, smashing the door into the wall as he did so.  They were in the kitchen and Mr Sutton pushed her up against the refrigerator and the stove.  Ms A said in her evidence that B was in the kitchen or the lounge room at the time calling to her.  However, later on in the walkthrough she said that she was in the bedroom (which was adjacent to the kitchen) when Mr Sutton grabbed her in front of the refrigerator and that she told B to run and get away.  She then ran out the front door and out of the house.  (B says she was outside at this time.  This inconsistency is of no account.)
14I now move to Mr Allen's account of events.  He did not give evidence.  (I should make the point that this cannot give rise to any adverse inference.)  I accept that the circumstances were extremely traumatic for him, that he very much acted on the spur of the moment and it can be readily accepted that some events could well have escaped his recollection altogether or become confused.  Distortion, which can be quite marked, of perception as well as memory is commonplace in such situations, quite apart from the ability to easily and fluently communicate.  (Mr Allen bordered, I thought, on the taciturn.)  I concluded that his accounts to police were truthful and reliable so far as the crucial events were concerned, though he certainly omitted some facts about preceding matters, perhaps because he did not think them to be important or just did not feel like mentioning them.  His interview at the police station commenced at about 1am after what was almost certainly a long day.  He looked tired, was occasionally emotional and upset, terse and impatient.  He obviously found revisiting the events painful; plainly (for good reason) he just wanted the interview over.  The walkthrough questioning on the next day was obviously a strain for him but I thought he was making a genuine attempt to give a truthful account, at least of how he came to shoot Mr Sutton.  (I deal with the potentially important question concerning a warning shot in due course.)   
15The following account is the effect of what Mr Allen said in both the interview and the walkthrough.  After some introductory questions, which do not call for mention, Mr Allen said that he and Mr Sutton got along ""famously"".  He said that he also got along well with Ms A and B.  He recalled Mr Sutton going to the shop to get groceries at around 5.30pm or 6pm in the evening.  Mr Sutton had been drinking all day and Mr Allen thought that the scale of his insobriety was 7 or 8 on a scale from 1 to 10.  When Mr Sutton returned to the property Ms A was cooking dinner and Mr Allen, who had been invited for dinner, was at the house.  He said that Mr Sutton returned and went into the kitchen.  He was belligerent and aggressive towards Ms A and B after he returned to the property.  Mr Allen could not remember what he said but it was ""verbal diarrhoea"".  He said that he didn't interfere and that Mr Sutton had said nothing to him.  The argument with Ms A started in the kitchen and they went outside.  She returned and he, B and Ms A then had their meal, Mr Sutton coming in later and eating his meal.  He went back to his caravan after dinner where he watched some videos with the door open.  Whilst he was sitting there he heard B screaming and he realized that something was happening.  He saw B running down the driveway and Ms A and Mr Sutton wrestling with a blockbuster about 15 feet from his caravan.   He grabbed the blockbuster from Mr Sutton and threw it into the back of his van (where, indeed, it was found by police when they arrived at the scene).  Ms A and Mr Sutton went to the ground.  They were screaming and ""carrying on"" and went into the house.   He then saw Mr Sutton come outside holding Ms A with a knife at her throat.  He was then at his caravan, about 50 metres away.
16It is clear that Mr Allen has not told the entire story of the physical exchange with Mr Sutton at this stage.  He has written himself out of any act of violence towards Mr Sutton although, as the accounts of Ms A and B show, they do not show him in a bad light.  His credibility is therefore adversely affected to this extent.  At all events, I am quite sure that there was indeed a ""scrimmage"" between Ms A and Mr Sutton on the ground before Ms A fled into the house, chased by an enraged Mr Sutton.  I should mention that there is no basis for thinking that Mr Allen was in any way the instigator of the fight with Mr Sutton.  
17I now come to the evidence of B as to what happened at this stage.  Her evidence is crucial to the Crown case against Mr Allen.  Indeed, it is manifest that unless, in at least two respects, it can be confidently relied on, he must be acquitted.  It must therefore be approached with considerable care and caution.  In these two matters (as well as others) her evidence differs from that of her mother and, markedly more so, with Mr Allen's account.  
18As I have mentioned, at the time of these events B was 10 years old and living with her mother, with whom she continues to live to the present time.  I am satisfied that she understood the distinction between a truth and a lie and what she said represented an honest recollection of events.  At the same time, I was doubtful that she really understood the true character of what she was saying in the sense that it was evidence that would be weighed in a court.  I found her apparent insouciance worrying.  I did not observe signs of careful consideration: the flow of information, though certainly guileless, did not demonstrate reflection.  Of course, I do not say this by way of criticism.  I do not doubt that she was indeed responding genuinely to the questions she was asked.  But, overall, I was not left with any firm confidence in the reliability of her account of facts that were vital to the prosecution's case.  These doubts were reinforced by the content of some of her evidence, which I discuss further below. 
19When B gave evidence in the trial by video link she was twelve and obviously had matured significantly in the interim.  I am sure she understood the effect of her affirmation in the sense that she knew that she had promised to tell the truth.  She had continued to live at the property with her mother since the events in question.  Her two interviews were played to her and the Crown prosecutor then asked her some clarifying questions, starting with the details of a sketch map that she had drawn for the police officer on the second occasion.  She said, when asked whether she recognised it as what she had drawn, ""Not really"" although she identified her handwriting on it.  On the plan she had marked two areas as dog runs, which are still there and used for the dogs, but was unable to recall whether these were on the property at the date of the incident although there is no doubt they were there and in the same position.  She must have seen the dogs running there very frequently.  She was unable to say whether the front gate was in the same position, although she thought it was.  I asked her about her dancing.  She said, when I asked her if she was going for an audition to see if she could get on to TV, ""not that I know of"".   She did not remember having costumes that she used to dance in.   However, she recalled that she used to practice dancing at home in the kitchen.  She did not remember any time when Mr Sutton got angry with her for doing this.  These matters are, of course, peripheral to the issues in the trial (except for the position of the gate which, as I later discuss, is of crucial importance) but they suggested, to my mind, that B's present memory of the events of two and a half years ago was likely to be limited.   
20More generally, B was asked - 
""Q.  Do you remember saying, or do you remember, apart from what you saw in those interviews that were played to you today, do you remember the things that happened that night or not?A.  Not all of it, some of the things that were in the video I don't even know I said.  I can't remember half of it.""
She remembered telling the officers that she ran away and went down the driveway.  However, when she was asked, ""do you remember saying that you saw things after you ran away?""  She said, ""No"".  She was asked if she remembered when it was or what caused her to run down the driveway and answered, ""Because I was scared and mum, I mean Todd, had mum, and I didn't know what to do, so I ran.""  This is plainly a reference to seeing Mr Sutton holding her mother at some point after they left the house.  She said that when she started to run away she could not remember where Mr Allen was.  I reminded B that after she had run away and got to the road she eventually came back to the gate.  She agreed that this happened.  I then asked, ""And when you got back to the gate, can you remember if you saw Keith or not at that time?""  She answered, ""No"".  The importance of this question and answer will become clear in due course.  In cross-examination it appeared that the half she could not remember was, in effect, those things that she had told the police about.  
21The questioning then continued - 
""Q.  So it's the case now, isn't it, that its difficult for you, if we ask questions about it now, to go back and recall what you told the police is completely accurate or not? A. Yes.
Q.  That's something that would be difficult for you to be able to do?A.  Yes.  
Q.  And is that because two years have passed?A.  Yes.
Q.  And is it also because you have tried to put some of these events out of your mind? A.  Yes.""
In light of this evidence, it is clear that the real question is whether what B told the police during her two interviews was reliable.  
22B's account started with the events of the afternoon, when she was playing with a tortoise near Mr Allen's caravan.  She said that when they went to the shop Mr Sutton met a man nicknamed Loose Tack (a relic of his rugby days) who, as it happened, had assaulted Mr C, B's father, and had a brief conversation and then returned home.  She said that her mother and Mr Allen found out about this.  She said Mr Allen hated Loose Tack because he (Mr Allen) was a very good friend of B's father.  An argument started in the kitchen with Mr Allen saying that he could not believe how he ""shook hands with the man who nearly bashed your [sic] dad to death"".  B said they started arguing about who paid the more tax.  B said that she then went outside.  It seems that these exchanges took place shortly after B and Mr Sutton returned from the shop, because B then spoke of Mr Sutton working out at the kennels and her mother cooking dinner and then she, her mother and Mr Allen sitting at the table with Mr Sutton's dinner in the oven.  When Mr Sutton came in he complained about not knowing that dinner was ready and ""started to get really agro"" he demanded his dinner and a chair but he didn't sit down, just eating and complaining about the food saying that the dogs were fed better than this.  B said ""he was really agro and then they all started to fight and stuff like that."" 
23(Ms A was questioned about B's version of events in the kitchen but, in substance, adhered to her account.  I am inclined to think that B's recollection is mostly correct, although I am sure that she had forgotten about the dancing and Mr Sutton's objection to it.  I have not attempted to resolve this issue as I do not think that it is significant.)  24B said that Mr Allen then went outside, followed by Mr Sutton.  B went to the outside toilet nearby.  She heard Mr Allen and Mr Sutton arguing and so she went to her mother, who was in the house on the telephone.  Her mother came out.  At that time Mr Allen and Mr Sutton were, as she first described it, hitting each other with sticks.  She corrected this a little later to say that she did not think that it was sticks, ""it was actually, Keith had a baseball bat"".  (Ms A said that she did not recall seeing a baseball bat being used but it was possible she had forgotten.  She said that bats were there.)  B said that her mother stepped in and Mr Sutton started to attack her with a stick.  She fell over, ""because Todd pushed her or something"" and B ran up to help her mother.  She and her mother moved away a little.  B then gives a somewhat confused account about the use of what she called the axe but which was plainly the blockbuster.  She was not sure who started with the implement but she said her mother and Mr Sutton swapped and then her mother and Mr Allen started swapping.  She said she didn't think anybody got hurt with the ""axe"".  She said ""they were just swinging it around.  And then um, Keith had the axe and Todd had a rock...  And Todd was teasing saying, 'Oh yeah hit me with your best shot' and stuff like that, but I don't think Keith did.""   She then said that Mr Sutton started to ""push mum and stuff like that, Keith went and got the gun.  And they were inside at the time, and that is when I walked off"".  
Sunset and twilight
25It was now about sunset.  Before resuming the narrative, it is useful to deal with the evidence that concerns the time of these events and the ambient light.  This evidence is uncontroversial.   Shortly after Mr Sutton had been shot and killed, three calls were made to 000: the first at 8.14.28pm (which was interrupted); the second, immediately after, at 8.14.47pm; and the third at 8.41.06pm.  The earlier calls were made by Ms A (taking 2 minutes 23 seconds) and the last by Mr Allen.  As to when Ms A went outside in response to B's telling her about the fight, the records show that a call was made commencing at 7.53.10pm and ending at 8.02.32pm.  It follows that the whole course of violent events, culminating in the death of Mr Sutton, took no more than twelve minutes, probably (because Ms A had to find the telephone which had been thrown into the yard by Mr Sutton) nine minutes.    
26According to the certificate from Geoscience Australia, the time of sunset on 4 December 2010 was 7.57pm and that of civil twilight was 8.25pm.  So far as the former time is concerned, it is defined as occurring when the upper edge of the sun is coincident with an ideal horizon.  The property, however, is only a few kilometres from hills to the north west, which would, of course, have an additional shading effect.  So far as the latter time is concerned, evening civil twilight is defined as the instant in the evening when the centre of the sun is six degrees below an ideal horizon.  As the report says - 
""At this time in the absence of moonlight, artificial lighting or adverse atmospheric conditions, the illumination is such that large objects may be seen but no detail is discernible.  The brightest stars and planets can be seen and, for navigation purposes at sea the sea horizon is clearly defined.""  
In the present case it is necessary to take into account the low storm clouds which were present (the police arrived at the scene at about 9.00pm at which time it was drizzling with rain), which would, of course, significantly limit the amount of ambient light otherwise being reflected from the sky.  Accordingly, there is objective evidence that, at the time of the altercation in the yard, it was well on the way to dark.  When the shots were fired the light was almost certainly as described in the definition of twilight. 
The threat to kill 
27I now take up the narrative at the point when Ms A has been chased into the house by Mr Sutton, breaking the inside wall with the force with which he opened the door after her.   Ms A's evidence was that Mr Sutton said ""I'll show you bitch"" and, forcing her against the refrigerator in the kitchen, grabbed her around the throat with his left arm and, getting a knife, held it at her throat with his right hand.  He pushed her out of the back door, using her as a ""shield"", and shouting, ""I'll show you bitch, I'll show you bitch, I'm gunna kill her, I'm gunna kill her"".  She said that B was yelling to her to run away.  (In the walkthrough it appeared that she thought that B was in the house at the time that Mr Sutton got the knife but this is less clear in her evidence, which I take to be that B was outside yelling and it was then that Ms A yelled at her to get away.  Nothing depends on this.)  She heard Mr Allen say, ""For Christ's sake, just let her go, let her go"".  Mr Sutton shouted, ""I'll kill you bitch, I'll kill you bitch"".  In the walkthrough, she said that as Mr Sutton was pushing her out of the house he was yelling to Keith, ""I'm gunna kill her, I'm gunna kill her"".  Ms A said in her evidence that when she heard Mr Allen shout out, ""For Christ's sake, let her go"" she did not know where he was but she thought that he was out the back somewhere.  She said that she was being strangled, she was nearly unconscious and could not speak because he had her so tightly around her neck.
28Mr Allen said that, after Mr Sutton followed Ms A into the house they came out and he was holding her with a knife at her throat.  Mr Sutton had an arm around her but, in effect, Mr Allen could not see exactly where it was because he was at his caravan about 50 metres away.  Mr Sutton was dragging her to the concrete slab where the cars were parked.  It was dark but ""there was a bit of light"".  He went and grabbed the .22 because he knew he couldn't stop him without the rifle.  Then he got the gun and walked down towards them.  It was already loaded so he did not have to reload it.  Ms A was struggling and screaming but Mr Allen did not remember all the words.  He remembered Mr Sutton saying, when he took the rifle, ""You're scared of me, senile old fool"".  He said that he didn't know whether he said anything to Mr Sutton before he fired but that Mr Sutton had told him ""I'm going to kill her"".  He said to police at the walkthrough that it was hard to tell how far away he was from Mr Sutton and Ms A when he fired the first shot but he indicated a distance of about 13 metres or so.  At first he told police that he did not remember firing a warning shot although he might have done so but then said that the first shot he fired was that which struck Mr Sutton in the shoulder.
29It is necessary to deal with B's evidence in rather more detail.  I start with her answers in the first interview, taking up the account from where she saw Mr Sutton pushing her mother on the ground, getting up and going into the house.  B said that, when Mr Sutton and her mother were inside, Mr Allen went and got the gun and ""that's when I walked off"".  (She thought he got it from what was called the ""dog caravan"", about 30 metres or so further from the house than Mr Allen's caravan, whilst Mr Allen said he got it from under the bed in his own caravan.  I discuss the timing below.  As to where the gun was, that does not seem to me to be important.)  The interview continued -  
""Q58.  Todd?A.  Yeah. Todd started to ah, like push mum and stuff like that um, Keith went and got the gun.  And they were inside at the time, and that's when I walked off
Q59  Who was inside?A.  Ah mum and Todd. They went down to the house and I was there for a bit when he let one shot off but that was just to test the gun, and then I went down.  And then, um, ah, he let one off, but I'm not sure if that got him or not.  And then that's when I heard, ah, Todd say, um, ""No I don't want to die"".  And then another shot went off and it just went silent.
Q60  O.K.  And what did you do then?A.  Um, I came back up from when I was down the road and um, I came back up the road and mum was crying, 'cause she didn't know where I was, 'cause I just went off.  And um, and she came down for me, and I saw Todd laying down, and then we just came up to the lounge and were sitting there and then you guys came.""  
It will be seen that from question 58 onwards it appeared that B was giving a sequential description of the events, although she omitted to mention at this point anything about Mr Sutton holding her mother around the neck and moving her towards the concrete slab.  
30The officer went back to the beginning, as it were, and took her through those events asking questions designed to elicit more details.  Going on to the point when B was on the road outside the gate and was about to walk up to the house, B mentioned seeing Mr Sutton with his arm around her mother's neck, ""like, carrying her"".  The interview continued - 
""Q 172. ...they came back outside? A.  Yeah
Q 173.  O.K.A.  And, like, Todd had her.  Um, like say if Keith had the gun or something and threatened to shoot him, he had, I'm just saying how he was holding her, like if he had the knife saying, 'If you shoot me I'll kill her' or something. That's how he was holding her.  Like, his arm around her neck and push, pushing her against him. 
Q174.  OK. So, so Todd had his arm around your mum's neck?A.  Yeah. 
Q 175.  And she couldn't get away?A.  No. 
Q 176.  So - - - A.  And that's all I saw, and then um oh, he, I think he already had the gun out.
Q. 177.  O.K.A.  And then um, I walked away.  I just like when they went inside, I walked down, but when I was walking up that's when I saw her, her, his arm around her.""  
31When B was giving this description, she gestured with her right hand, as though she held a knife at her throat in a cutting motion.  She later said that she only saw Mr Sutton and her mother from behind and did not see the knife.  From this account, whether B actually saw Mr Allen with a gun at this point is uncertain.
32The officer took up the interview as follows - 
""Q 180.  O.K.  And so when they came outside the house he had his arm around her neck?  A.  Yeah.
Q181.  O.K.  And is that when Keith went and got the gun?A.  Ah, no, he had, already had the gun I think.  And then um, I think he shot him in the shoulder.
Q182.  Pardon?A.  I think he shot him in the shoulder, 'cause he, I could hear him like going ""Ow"" and stuff like that, because I didn't think it was that severe.  And then after that um, when, when I walked down, when I heard him say, ""Please, I don't want to die"", and then another shot went off and it all just went silent ... Then nothing happened.""
33I should mention at this stage that I consider, had B actually seen the shot to the shoulder or the circumstances in which the second shot was fired, she would have mentioned it at this stage.  Her language, moreover, is cast in terms that, in effect, state that she heard rather than saw these events.  This interpretation is confirmed by her demeanour at this point, which, because of the importance of this issue, I have looked at carefully several times.
34The officer took B back to the earlier gunshot ""to test the gun"".  B confirmed that she saw him do this just outside the caravan and indicated how the rifle was held, using both arms raised as though holding a rifle.  The officer then asked - 
""Q191.  Ah hmm.  And then what did you do after he tested it?A.  I, um, I stayed there and um, I was like sort of tripping, 'cause I was crying too much and I had a really bad headache, and I couldn't see properly.
Q192.  Were you scared?A.  Yeah.
Q193.  Ah hmm.A.  And I felt really sick.
Q194.  Is that when you started walking down the road?A.  Yeah.
Q195.  And that's when you heard Todd say, ""I don't want to die""?A.  Yeah.
Q196.  And then you heard the second shot?A.  Yeah 
Q197.  O.K.  But you didn't see what happened with that?A.  No.""
This last question and answer confirm my understanding of the effect of her earlier description of events.
35B's second interview occurred on 17 December 2010.  She was asked to repeat what had happened on the night of 4 December 2010.  The interview commenced with an exploration of background matters not presently relevant.   As to when Mr Allen got the gun and what followed in her account is as follows - 
""Todd got her and pushed her to the ground and I, and I ran again [down the driveway I think] and then after that I went, well not after that, when they were still fighting Keith went and got the gun from the dog caravan and then I was up at the caravan at that time when he went and got the gun and then he let one off to test the gun and then I went out and Todd had mum and he, took her inside and I went to the gate and mum told me that he had a knife to his neck, had a knife to her neck, and was saying ""I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you"" and then he, then Todd came out still with the knife to, to her neck outside and Keith had to do something so I am not sure if, I think he just let one off and then he let go or shot him in the arm or something because I can hear like, really bad pain, and like, no and no and stuff and then when I, that was when I was out of the gate, 'cause I could hear it and then after I heard Todd say no I don't want to die, I don't want to die and then one, another gun shot went off and everything was silent and I stayed down the, because I went down the road and stayed there for about ten minutes and after that shot went I stayed there for five minutes and mum didn't know where I was and she was crying so I, I came back through the gate and then mum came running down and I saw Todd just laying there and then we went back up the lounge and we sat down and then the police came."" 
36When taken back to what happened after Mr Sutton and her mother were struggling on the ground, she said that she did not actually see them go inside the house because by this stage she went out the front gate (that is to say to the road).  She said that Mr Allen got the gun whilst she was checking the telephone in the caravan to ring the police.  However, it was not working.  At this time she did not know where her mother and Mr Sutton were and could not hear them.  When Mr Allen came back out (of the dog caravan) he was holding the gun in the air and ""just let one off to see what it was like, if it had bullets, or to see if it was working"".  She said she thought this was the reason because ""he was just looking and he's just like bang"".  She said that she'd never seen that gun used before by Mr Allen, her mother or Mr Sutton although people who had visited the property to shoot kangaroos for the dogs used it.  She said that once he let the round off she went out the gate because ""I knew something bad was going to happen so I didn't want to see it so I just went out the gate"".  B thought that her mother and Mr Sutton were inside when Mr Allen got the gun.  The next thing that she saw from outside the gate was Mr Sutton grabbing her mother and pushing her out with the knife to her neck.  She said that her mother was stumbling.  He had his right arm around her mother's neck though she could only see them from the back.  She said that Mr Sutton had her mother in front of him as distinct from beside him.  She described the knife as a large kitchen knife with a black handle and silver blade used for chopping pumpkins and stuff like that.  He held that knife in his left hand.  She could not hear anything said but she thought that Mr Allen was yelling out, ""let her go, let her go"".  She said that she could see him near his caravan.  She then walked further down the road then came back and went further down.  She just wanted to hear that everything was ""alright"" for her to go back in.  She was asked -
""Q362.  So what could you hear that made you sort of go back up and then you saw that?  A.  Like, well, it wasn't actually, it was actually quite quiet for a while when I couldn't hear anything so that's why I went but then I heard them screaming and I saw them but I couldn't really actually see them.  I like, blacked out, I couldn't see anything, it was like I dreamed that I could sort of see and then I came back, went back down and I was crying too much and I went back down then I came back up again and then, then after that gun shot went off everything was silent and that's when I stayed there for five minutes then I went back up and then everything was silent so I just went back in.
Q363.  Alright. So after you saw this and you left to go back down the street what was the next thing that you heard?A.  Keith yelling out to let her go.
Q364.  O.K.  Yes and what was the next thing that you heard after that?A.  The gun shot.""    B said that she was out of the driveway and down the road (from the gate) but not very far.  She said that she walked about 100 feet or so away from the house and that she was away about 20 minutes, walking back and forth.  She said that once she heard the second shot she stayed there for about five minutes and walked back.  As she did this, her mother was walking down and then she saw Mr Sutton lying there and started crying even more.  They went up and sat on the lounge.
37This passage is hard to interpret with any confidence: it seems the screaming and B's being unable to see anything occurred after the shot to the shoulder was fired.  I think that it is probable that, having regard to the earlier passage from this interview, set out above, B was saying that she did not, perhaps could not, see the circumstances in which the second shot was fired.  This view, again, is confirmed by my observation of the way she said this in the video.  The officer asked her what she heard, not what she saw, no doubt because of what she had said in B's first interview as well as what she understood B to have been saying thus far.  However, B almost immediately gave an account, hitherto not mentioned, to the effect that she saw the second shot being fired.  I will come to this part of her evidence, on which the prosecution placed great reliance, after I have dealt with the evidence of Ms A and the statements of Mr Allen as to the shooting.
The death of Mr Sutton
38Ms A's evidence of the events after she was taken from the house is to the following effect.  It was somewhat abbreviated because of her emotional state.  She obviously found it very painful and difficult to recall these events.  She said Mr Sutton had taken her from the house and pushed her ahead of him with his arm tight around her neck and the knife to her throat, moving to the concrete parking slab.  The next thing she could remember was Mr Sutton saying, ""He shot me in the shoulder"".  She did not hear a shot and only had ""very fuzzy"" vision of what was happening.  But Mr Sutton did not release her and continued to hold the knife at her neck.  After a short time, which she was unable to specify, she remembered being let go and dropping to the ground and that Mr Sutton was on the ground.  She said that Mr Allen told her to get the phone, ring the police and go and get B.  
39In her walkthrough account, Ms A said that Mr Allen was telling Mr Sutton, ""Come on mate, stop being a dickhead and all that"".  She said that Mr Allen was near the pumpkin patch (about 20 metres away according to the police sketch of the scene) when Mr Sutton took her between the back fence and the edge of the concrete slab until they were standing approximately two metres in.  Mr Sutton repeatedly threatened to kill her.  (It is worth noting, I think, that two vehicles were parked on the slab, behind which Mr Sutton could have sheltered if he were actually afraid of Mr Allen's rifle.  It is likely that he was not then aware of the weapon.)  He moved well beyond the cars and within clear sight of Mr Allen.  Ms A said that Mr Allen had ""come down a bit closer"" and fired a shot into the ground or into the air saying, ""Let her go, let her go"".  She said that she was not struggling or wrestling because he had the knife.  (Ms A also said that B heard the warning shot and was then running down the road but I think this is what B later told her.)   At this point it was nearly dark.  She did not know how far away Mr Allen was because she was choking and starting to lose consciousness.  She heard a shot and Mr Sutton say, ""He shot me in the shoulder"".  It could have been five or ten seconds later that he dropped to the ground.  
40Ms A said that she then ran towards Mr Allen who told her to ""just leave him be, ring the police and go and get your daughter"" who, by this time, was screaming and running down the road.  She indicated, although with some uncertainty, that Mr Allen was standing about 15 metres away.  Although Ms A saw B running up the roadway she could only make out her pink clothes which, of course, stood out.  She said that she went to find the phone since Mr Sutton had ripped it off the caravan wall and thrown it away.  It was about two or three metres away from where Mr Allen had been standing.  She then made the 000 call to the police, saying that someone had been shot but not that he was dead or had been killed, although she believed this to be the case.  This belief is unexplained.  She did not examine the body.  Possibly she saw the wound to the forehead and has now forgotten this.  Most likely, I think, it was surmise on her part.  She did not recall what she then did with the telephone but just ran down and got B, who was running up the driveway.  They went around the front of the house and sat there on a lounge outside until the police arrived.
41It was suggested to Ms A by the Crown prosecutor that, after Mr Sutton said he had been shot in the shoulder or at the time he said it, he released her.  She denied this and added, ""He choked me tighter"" and was still holding the knife to her throat.  He did eventually release her but not immediately.  She denied that Mr Sutton had said, ""I don't want to die"" and also that after this was said he was shot the second time.  She said that she did not hear Mr Sutton say anything after he had said he had been shot in the shoulder.  There was no exclamation of pain: he just ""squeezed me tighter"".   Ms A also said that she had been the victim of violence by Mr Sutton on a number of earlier occasions, always when he was in drink. 
42I now turn to Mr Allen's account of the shooting, taking up the narrative from where it was left above.  He told police he would have hit Mr Sutton's right shoulder.  He said that he was holding Ms A to his left, ""That's why I got room to get the shoulder, her head was in the way before that"".  Mr Sutton said, ""he's hit me in the shoulder."" but he did not fall to the ground, Mr Allen, commenting, ""A .22 you don't, no"", obviously a reference to its light calibre.  Nor did Mr Sutton drop the knife.  Mr Allen said that when he fired the second shot ""they both fell backwards"".  He did not know where the second shot hit Mr Sutton but he was aiming for the shoulder ""so he'd drop the knife"".  When questioned further about the sequence of events, he said  ""I fired and it hit him in the shoulder I think and he was still, still going to cut her throat and then I fired again and that was it. I thought I shot her"".  When asked about where he was standing, he said he could not do this because ""things were happening, you know what I mean, screaming - its very hard for you to take, you know what you guys want, I can't give you because it was too, too much screaming happening, you know what I mean.""  He said that, when he fired the rifle, it was to his shoulder and he was intending, ""to shoot him, stop him from cutting her throat"".  The two shots were not long apart, seconds rather than minutes.  He had experience with guns some years ago but not much experience with that particular gun, only having fired it three or four times.  He said that when Mr Sutton and Ms A fell backwards after the second shot he said he ""could see what's happened"" and said to Ms A to ""go inside and ring the police"".  He was asked, ""The time you fired those shots, can you describe what emotions you were feeling?"" and replied, ""I had none at the time, there was too much screaming. I was worried about the child and it was though she flipped out you know, you know the deep, not just a scream, she was in a frenzy.""  He was asked if he knew whether B had seen what had happened and said, ""Yes, 'cause she was in the house when he had dragged her out of the house"" so that of course she would have seen this happen.  He said that he did not know that she had seen the shots because she was running down the driveway when (as I understand him) Ms A was on the slab being held.
43Although Mr Allen said that he rang the police straightaway, it is clear that this was a mistake.  He actually did not ring the police until some 25 minutes or so later.  Mr Allen said that after the shooting and Ms A retrieved B he did not go over to the deceased.  He said, ""I just looked and knew he was dead and I backed off"" and he told Ms A ""to go inside once she got up"".  He didn't touch Mr Sutton but he ""just looked like"" he was dead.  He said that he did not believe that there was any other way that the situation could have been resolved without using the gun because Mr Sutton was ""too strong for us"".  He was asked about firing a warning shot and said that he fired a warning shot at the shoulder.  He was asked about firing a warning shot into the ground or over his head and said,  ""No, you don't have time to consider when you see someone's going to get their throat cut"".  He was asked, ""When you fired that shot were you pretty confident that you'd get him in the shoulder"", and replied ""No confidence whatsoever"".  At this point Mr Allen indicated discomfort about the bags over his hand and said that he was finished, that it was too upsetting, that he felt sick in the stomach and the interview terminated.
44During the walkthrough, Mr Allen pointed, though with some uncertainty, to a place on the driveway about 13 metres or so from where Mr Sutton's body was found as being where he was when the first shot was fired.  He had been standing behind a box about a metre high (which was still there and evident in the police photos) but, as Mr Allen said, ""You could see them from the waist up"".  (When he was indicating these things to police, Mr Allen was obviously very upset.)  Not surprisingly, he found it difficult to indicate with any certainty where he was standing.  
45Mr Allen said he moved closer to try to shoot Mr Sutton again in the shoulder to make him let go of the knife and indicated moving forward about 15 paces, saying that he stood ""about here"" when he fired the second shot.  That would have placed him perhaps four metres from where Ms A was being held.  He recalled, after Ms A had collected B, she came up to where he was sitting near the pumpkin patch and asked him to talk to B but, Mr Allen said, he told her ""No, go back in there, keep her inside til the police get here"".  He said that he rang the police because he thought that, although Ms A had tried to ring, she was screaming and he thought she had not ""got through"".  Mr Allen repeated that he was sure that he only fired two shots, the first shot hitting Mr Sutton in the shoulder and the second shot to try and get him to drop the knife.
46I now return to B's third account of what happened after the first shot was fired to Mr Sutton's shoulder, taking up the interview from where I left it earlier - 
""Q363.  Alright. So after you saw this and you left to go back down the street what was the next thing that you heard?A.  Keith yelling out let her go.
Q364.  O.K.  Yes and what was the next thing that you heard after that?A.  The gun shot. 
Q365.  The gun shot.  O.K.  And what did you hear after the gun shot?A.  Silence.  
Q366.  Silence. O.K.  So you've talked before about, you said before about you heard Todd saying that he didn't want to die?A.  Yeah.
Q367.  Yes so when did you hear him say that?A.  Before the gun shot went off like, saying, ""No, I don't want to die"" and the gun shot went off and everything was silent.  
Q368.  So when, first of all, Keith tested the gun?A.  Mmm Mmm. 
Q369.  Yes and then so you've left - - - A.  Mmm Mmm.
Q370.  - - - And then you've sort of come back up and you saw mum and Todd?A.  Mmm Mmm.
Q371.  And you said that then you could hear Keith saying, ""Let her go, let her go"".  Now what happened between that or did anything happen between then and when you heard him say he didn't want to die?A.  When Keith said, ""Let her go, let her go"", I think he let one off and then he let her go, a gun shot off and then Todd went to where the cars are and then he's like, ""No I don't want to die, I don't want to die"", then a gun shot went off and everything was silent.
Q372.  O.K. And how do you know that he went to where the cars are? A.  Because I saw him.
Q373.  You saw him?A.  Because I saw him when mum came up, well I actually did see Keith shoot him and like, he was sitting down and he was saying, ""No I don't want to die"" and then I saw Keith like that and then it went bang and I just - - - 
Q374 All right so you heard the gun shot?A.  Mmm Mmm.
Q375.  You heard him let one off and you said that you saw him?A.  Mmm Mmm.
Q376.  And whereabouts did you see, whereabouts, actually what I might do is we might use a different colour again O.K.  And so when you saw Keith shoot Todd and then he fell on the ground and he was saying he didn't want to die is that right?A.  No. 
Q377. No?A. He was already on the ground, Todd was with his elbow and he's like, ""No I don't want to die"". Then he fell back after the gun shot went off.
Q378. O.K. So---A.  I'll just make the whole car thing.
Q379.  O.K. So what's that a picture of can you tell me?A.  Todd laying down and Keith with the gun.
Q380.  O.K. So I just---A.  And mum - - - 
Q381.   - - - want to make sure that I get it right and I'm not confused O.K? So when, first of all you said that you think you heard him let one off -A.  Mmm Mmm.
Q382.  - - - and that's when Todd let go of mum - - - A.  Yep.
Q383.  O.K. Did you see that bit happen?A.  No.
Q384.  No. O.K. Whereabouts were you when that part happened?A.  Still down the road but not that far. I could hear everything.
Q385 Alright and so what made you come back to the house?A.   Because I couldn't hear anything and so then I came up but then I heard the gun, I saw Keith with the gun and then the gun shot went off so I went back down then I came back up and I looked and then everything was silent so I came back up.
Q386 O.K.  So when you came back up and you saw that Todd was on the ground and he was saying he didn't want to die?A.  Yeah.
Q387.  Where was mum?A.  Mum was up here sitting on the seat.
Q388.  Can you mark her down for me?A.  The seat.
Q389 O.K. And whereabouts were you when you saw that? How far away were you when you saw that happen?A.  Just at the gate
Q390.  Just at the gate O.K. And was there, could you see straight to where that happened or was there anything in your way?A.  There was a bit of branches.
Q391.  O.K. But you could see where everyone was?A.  Yep.
Q392.  O.K.   And can you tell me when Todd was on the ground he was saying I don't want to die, what was Keith doing? Was he standing up, sitting down?A.  Standing up.
Q393.  He was standing up and how was he standing?A.  Just like that.
Q394.  So can I get you to stand up for me and show me how he was standing?A.  Like, like that.
Q395.  Like that O.K. And when you go like that what was he holding?A.  The gun.
Q396.  He was holding the gun. O.K. And where was the gun pointed?A.  At him.
Q397.  At him? At?A.  Todd.
Q398.  Todd.  And then, O.K.  And then what happened when you saw him standing there with the gun? What was the next thing that happened?A.  Gun shot, silence.
Q399.  Gun shot then silence. O.K.  And what did Keith do when that happened?A.  I think, I, I didn't see that but when I came back he was sitting up next to mum.
Q400.  O.K.  So as soon as you saw that happen and the second shot and what did you, what could you see of Todd? What did Todd do when the second shot went off?A.  Let got of mum, oh the second shot?
Q401.  Sorry, the second shot when you just said before that he was on the ground and Keith was standing up?A.  Keith, Todd was just laying down.

Q412.  And where was Keith?A.  Up sitting next to mum.
Q413.  O.K. And what about the gun? Could you see where the gun was?A.  No.
Q414.  No. Alright and then what was the next thing that happened?A.  Mum came running down to me and cuddled me and we went to the lounge out, pardon, our outside lounge and we sat down there and waited for the police to come.
Q415.  O.K.  And did you talk to mum about what had happened?A.  No.""
After some further questions the officer asked whether the time between the first shot and the second when Mr Sutton was already on the ground, ""Was it a long time or a short time?""  B replied, ""A short time"".  
47B was taken through the sequence of events again and then asked how she knew that on the second shot Mr Sutton had let go of her mother and answered, ""Because then I, because then I saw Todd walk down to the thing. So, yeah like, as soon as that shot went off I walked and then I saw him just walking ... like, very like, boom, boom, really angry and stuff"".  She added, ""I just saw him walking down and then I didn't see the rest of it until when Keith had the gun"".  In a later description of this time she said that she saw Mr Sutton stomping ""and then didn't see the rest until when everything was silent again so then I went back up but then I saw Keith with the gun"".  
48B was asked why she thought Mr Sutton was shot in the shoulder.  She said -
""Because I could hear like really bad pain like, sort of when, when Keith went, let that one off to let go of mum I think he got shot in the shoulder because he was really, ah and screaming.  He was like, no and that's why I think that caused him to say no I don't want to die.""
A little further on, the following was said - 
""Q455.  - - - and then its gone quiet and you came back and you saw - - -A.  And then Keith with the gun and then - - -
Q456.  - - - Keith with the gun and - - -A.  - - - then I walked - - - 
Q457.  - - - and Todd on the ground?A.  Yeah and then I walked off and the gun shot went off and then everything was silent for five minutes so then I went back up.  
Q458.  O.K.  Alright and then that's when you met up with mum and came and sat on the lounge?A.  Yep.""
49Although in fact two cars were parked on the slab at this time, B was not sure and could not remember whether there were any cars there.  The officer then went over the same ground - 
""Q482.  And the last time that you had seen mum that she was with Todd at that point and that's when you went away - - - A.  Yep.
Q483.  Yep O.K.  And then you said that you saw, after that shot you saw Todd walking along - - - A.  Down to the cars.  
Q484.  - - - down to where the cars are? Yes and you said the next thing that you saw him on the ground.  How did he come to be on the ground?A.  Well I think, as I said that he might have got shot in the shoulder but that he just came to the ground.  
Q485.  So you didn't see him go onto the ground?A.  Yeah nah.
Q486.  O.K.  So you've seen him walking - - - A.  Yep.
Q487.  - - - but then the next time you saw him - - - A.  Yep, yep but when Keith had the gun I saw him on the ground. 
Q488.  O.K.  And other than hearing him say, ""No I don't want to die"" did you hear anything else being said between Keith and Todd at that time?A.  No.""
B said that her mum was sitting on the seat for the whole time that this was happening.  I should mention that when describing how Mr Allen fired the final shot, B held her right arm straight at an angle of about 45 degrees, using her fingers as though she was holding a pistol, which was in marked contrast to what she indicated when showing how Mr Allen had held the rifle when he fired the ""testing"" shot.  
50B was then asked about times.  She said that it was about 20 minutes between the time that Mr Allen fired the testing shot to when he fired the first shot at Mr Sutton.
Crown submissions
51The Crown prosecutor submitted that I would accept B's evidence as to the circumstances of the infliction of the head wound and conclude therefore that Mr Allen, perhaps carried away in the heat of the moment or by way of a preemptive strike in case Mr Sutton recovered and attacked Ms A or him again, killed him when he was no longer, as any reasonable person would have realised, a danger.  He submitted, in the alternative, that I should accept at least that Mr Sutton did say that he did not want to die and, at that time, he had released Ms A who was thus no longer at risk.  He submitted that B could have heard, in the quietness of a rural setting, the words she said Mr Sutton had used.  He pointed out that B was an honest witness.  Moreover, she had shown that she was aware of the distinction between what she had been told and what she witnessed and the difference between truth and lies.  
52Referring to Ms A's description of being held like a ""shield"", the prosecutor submitted that I should accept that the accused had obtained the gun at an earlier point than he claimed and that Mr Sutton had reason to fear that Mr Allen might want to shoot him because of their previous argument concerning his shaking hands with the man who had so badly injured Mr Allen's great friend, Ms A's former partner.  
53The prosecutor also pointed to the autopsy report as to the position and the direction of the wounds as inconsistent with Mr Allen's account of events.  He submitted that this showed that Mr Sutton's position had changed significantly after the first shot and provided strong support for B's evidence that he had walked away from Ms A following the first shot.  Moreover, the fact that Mr Allen knew he was dead without examining the body strongly suggested that he had deliberately shot Mr Sutton in the head at short range as described by B.
54Finally, it was submitted that, even if I concluded that it was reasonably possible that Mr Allen had fired both shots in defence of Ms A, I would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was not objectively reasonable to fire the second shot at Mr Sutton's head as distinct from one or other of his shoulders.
Conclusion 
55It will be seen that B's first two accounts of what occurred after the warning shot or testing shot was fired did not refer at all to seeing Mr Sutton on the ground at any point before she was taken by her mother back up to the house.  Not only was it omitted but, in my view, these earlier accounts exclude the possibility that she saw this event.  I am also of the view that those earlier accounts are inconsistent with her seeing Mr Sutton walk away by himself from where he was first shot.  I accept that B believed, at the time, that Mr Sutton was shot in the shoulder but this was not because she saw it.  Nor were there any circumstances that could have led her to think that this had happened.  There were therefore only two sources of information in this respect.  The first was the possibility that her mother had told her of this before the police came whilst they were sitting on the lounge at the front of the house.  However, B, in effect, denies that this was the source of her belief.  The only other possibility is that she heard (but has forgotten) Mr Sutton say that he had been shot in the shoulder.  It is also of considerable and troubling significance, to my mind, that B's second interview occurred something like two weeks after the events in question.  
56It is necessary to take into account some objective facts.  First, it is clear from the timing of the phone calls that, from beginning to end, the entire incident could not have taken more than 10 minutes.  Secondly, it was quite dark by the time of the shooting, even allowing a generous period of three or four minutes before Ms A telephoned 000 for the first time.  This is something like 15 minutes before civil twilight at which time, as I have mentioned, in the absence of moonlight, artificial lighting or adverse atmospheric conditions (this latter feature undoubtedly being present), the illumination enables large objects to be seen but no detail is discernible.  
57When the police officer went to the property on the following day at 8.15pm, in an attempt to record the light, she recalled that it was dark, that she could not have read a newspaper and that, without the benefit of artificial light, one could only see silhouettes of people and then only if they were against a light background.  She said that at 30 to 40 metres she did not believe that anyone could have been seen unless they were silhouetted.  She said that it was not raining at the time although, from the video that she took, the rain clouds seem very much evident and quite low.  That view, making allowances for the fact that it is a video and not the human eye, confirms my own observations at the view which was conducted during the trial that, for a significant period before the light appeared to match that of the description in the expert's report, it was exceedingly difficult to see any details.  I viewed the slab at the point indicated by the investigating officer as being where Mr Sutton lay and a detective stood there for this purpose.  I moved along the gate and down the road until my view of the slab was completely obscured by blue plastic placed along the outside dog run.  I was informed, as is obvious from the photographs taken at the scene and exhibited in the trial, that this feature was the same as at the date of the incident.  It was necessary, of course, to bend down to what seemed to me to be the height of B as shown in the video recording of her interviews.  When I did so, I concluded that it was not possible for B to have seen, from the gate or anywhere down the road looking back up into the property, Mr Sutton either sitting up or on his elbow or lying down on the slab where his body was found. 
58It is, moreover, difficult to accept that Mr Sutton fell to the ground because of the shot in the shoulder.  That was not by any means a serious injury, although it was probably painful.  I accept Ms A's evidence and the statement of Mr Allen that it did not lead him to let go of Ms A or to drop the knife.  The overwhelmingly more likely cause of his fall to the ground was the second shot to his head.  This scenario is to my mind far more likely than that described by B as an explanation for Mr Sutton being on the ground.  Of course this would mean that he was at no point sitting up or on his elbow but rather fell to the ground almost certainly dead.  
59The extensive passage from B quoted above also gives a somewhat confused and, to a degree, inconsistent chronology of events.  
60Putting all these matters together, as well taking into account my own impression of B's interviews, which I have closely examined from beginning to end a number of times, I have concluded that I could not be satisfied to any reasonable degree of certainty that her account of seeing Mr Sutton on the ground, whether sitting or on his elbow or supine is a reliable recollection.  Strengthening this conclusion is her inability to describe what happened from the time she said that she saw Mr Sutton walking away by himself from Ms A and his being on the ground.  To this I add her own telling description of her feelings and experience at this time, vividly recounted in her answer to question 362 set out above.  I should mention, also, that I am quite satisfied that, from the gate or from along the road, B could not have seen the seat or her mother sitting on it which she has described.   
61Two other parts of B's evidence are important to note.  The first is her recollection of hearing Mr Sutton say, ""I don't want to die, I don't want to die"".  I have concluded that this recollection is not reliable.  It is necessary to bear in mind what she was feeling at the time, which I have already mentioned.  It is notorious that, when perceptions occur in frightening or emotionally laden circumstances, especially of events that are rapidly unfolding, they are often very significantly distorted and misremembered.  There is a substantial risk of confabulation and even apparently striking events can be mistakenly recollected.  These are commonsense considerations which are of considerable significance in a case of this kind.  Necessarily, one's doubts are compounded if a witness (such as B) has demonstrably confabulated other circumstances which are vividly described and, at first blush, one would be minded to accept.  My strong suspicion is that, indeed, B did hear Mr Sutton say something after he had been shot.  Possibly it was his complaint about being shot in the shoulder (which was the source of her knowledge about this wound); if she did not hear it distinctly, which is very likely from where she was standing about 50 metres away, she might well have reconstructed what was said.  It is not impossible that the words ""want to die"" were used but it is also reasonable to surmise that they were not used of himself but in relation to Ms A.  This is so, even though neither Mr Allen nor Ms A say that such words were used.  Both say, however, that words amounting to threats to kill Ms A were used and I accept that this was so.  In short, I do not accept as reliable B's recollection of hearing Mr Sutton say, ""I don't want to die, I don't want to die"".
62In this analysis of B's evidence, I left out of account Ms A's evidence and what was said by Mr Allen which, as I largely mentioned, I found was substantially truthful as to the crucial facts.  So far as Ms A is concerned, although the circumstances of the physical altercation that occurred before she went inside followed by Mr Sutton left out a number of details which were described by B, I do not think that this adversely affects the basic truthfulness and reliability of her account.  What happened after she was chased into the house by Mr Sutton was obviously a terrifying experience and that she omitted some of the details of preceding events when giving her account to the police or indeed in this Court is not surprising.  She said that both she and Mr Sutton dropped to the ground after Mr Sutton had been shot, obviously for the second time, although she did not hear that shot.  In substance, her account is inconsistent with Mr Allen shooting at Mr Sutton after this event and, of course, inconsistent with B's later elaborated recollection.  In substance, also, Ms A's evidence is inconsistent with sitting nearby whilst Mr Allen fired that second shot, let alone sitting with him after this event.  I accept that after finding the phone, which took a couple of minutes no doubt and making the call to 000 which took only a little over two minutes, she immediately ran down to B, who was on the road, I think moving towards the gate.  So far as the warning shot is concerned Ms A said that she did not see or hear it.  That is consistent with B's account if she was in the house and being manhandled by Mr Sutton who was then threatening to kill her.  Mr Allen's statements about this matter seemed to waiver at one point but, in the end, he was sure that he fired only two shots.  I think that it is not impossible that he fired a warning shot as Mr Sutton was chasing Ms A into the house or shortly after that, as stated by B, and that it was for this reason that Mr Sutton dragged Ms A outside using her body as a shield.  If this were so, then Mr Allen's account is either dishonest or a failure of recollection, given the nature of the events that happened.  Realistically, I think that Mr Allen, for some reason, decided he would not mention this shot.  It is difficult to understand why he would not, since firing a warning shot, one would think, would tend to explain why it was necessary to shoot Mr Sutton, as he disregarded not only the shot to his shoulder but the earlier warning shot and maintained both the threat and the ability to carry it out until the final shot.  Be that as it may, in the end I am not satisfied that this adversely affects in any significant way Mr Allen's account of the two crucial shots.
63In short, although B's accounts are by and large reliable, I was not satisfied that those parts that dealt with the shooting and the closely surrounding facts could be relied on.
64So far as the autopsy results are concerned, I do not think that they can be relied on in the manner contended by the prosecution.  It was not a static situation. I do not think it could safely be concluded that Mr Sutton remained in the same position when he had been shot and Mr Allen himself moved after the first shot and not certainly simply straight towards Mr Sutton.  Moreover, the actual direction of the second bullet before it struck Mr Sutton is conjectural.  The range of possible angles is such that no conclusion could be safely drawn as to where Mr Sutton was standing relative to Mr Allen at the time the shot was fired, let alone that Mr Sutton was no longer holding Ms A.
65Mr Allen must be acquitted if I accept that there is a reasonable possibility that he acted in defence of Ms A and that the force he used was reasonable in all the circumstances.  It must be borne in mind that there was no time for careful or dispassionate reflection.  Mr Sutton was drunk and enraged.  It is not reasonable to think that Mr Allen should not have taken his threats to kill Ms A seriously.  To the contrary, his belief in their genuineness was completely justifiable.  He made a judgment call.  So far from it being wrong, let alone criminal, it was almost certainly right.  In this context, the fact that he believed he had killed Mr Sutton without examining him, is inconsequential.
66Accordingly, not only am I not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Allen did not act in defence of another and the extent of force used was unreasonable, I should state in fairness to him that I have positively concluded that he acted from beginning to end to prevent Ms A from suffering very serious injury and possibly death at the hands of Mr Sutton and did so reasonably, considering the means that he had at his disposal. Accordingly, the appropriate verdict was not guilty.

2761532,Zamudin v R [2013] NSWCCA 120,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  Following a trial before a judge and jury in March 2012, the applicant and two co-accused were convicted of the following offence:
""Between about 29 November 2010 and about 1 December 2010 in the seas between the Republic of Indonesia and the Territory of Christmas Island, Australia, [they] facilitated the bringing or coming to Australia of a group of at least five persons, namely a group of ninety-seven (97) persons, who were non-citizens and who had or have no lawful right to come to Australia, and they did so reckless as to whether the said ninety-seven persons had, or have, a lawful right to come to Australia.
Contrary to Section 233C(1) Migration Act 1958 (Law Part Code:  72121). ""
2The applicant seeks to appeal against his conviction upon the ground that the verdict against him of guilty was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence (see s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912).  He requires leave to appeal as his application does not relate to a question of law alone (ibid, s 5(1)(b)).  On appeal the sole issue between the parties is whether the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant knew that the asylum seekers were destined for Australia, either because he knew the vessel was destined for Christmas Island which he knew was a part of Australia, or that he knew that the ultimate destination of the passengers was Australia.  An accused's knowledge that the destination of persons whose journey he assists is Australia is an essential element of an offence under s 233C(1) (Sunada v R [2012] NSWCCA 187 [5] - [7]). 
AGREED FACTS
3A Statement of Agreed Facts tendered at the trial established the following.
4On 1 December 2010, a Royal Australian Navy ship intercepted Suspected Irregular Entry Vessel (""SIEV"") 217 within Australian territorial waters, about 1.31 nautical miles from Christmas Island.  At the time, SIEV 217 was headed towards Christmas Island.  
5On board the vessel were three Indonesian crew members (being the applicant and his two co-accused) and 97 passengers, none of whom had a valid visa authorising their entry into Australia.
THE CROWN CASE
6Chief Petty Officer Philpott, who was in charge of the intercepting party, gave evidence that:
The vessel was very crowded.  Some people were lying down, some were sitting and some were standing.Christmas Island is approximately 800 nautical miles off the coast of Australia and 180 nautical miles off the coast of Indonesia.
7Mr Reza Khatooni, a passenger on the vessel, gave evidence that:
He saw the applicant handing out biscuits and water to the passengers but did not see the applicant doing anything else.As the Navy vessel approached, the co-accused Mr Asis gestured to him that the police were coming, by bringing his hands together as if in handcuffs.
8Mr Esmaeil Abgoon, another passenger, gave evidence:
Mr Asis did most of the steering.  The applicant and the co-accused, Mr Armin, both attended to the vessel's motor and assisted with the steering.  The vessel was not strong and safe and the conditions for the passengers were not good, with nowhere to sleep, no facilities and no life jackets.  
9Mr Hamid Ghoondoghdoei, another passenger, gave evidence that:
There was only food and water on the vessel and no other facilities.He saw the applicant steering the boat on occasions, as well as looking after the engine and preparing food for the passengers.
10Maps tendered by the Crown showed that Christmas Island lies directly south of the western end of the island of Java, which is part of Indonesia, and that if a vessel travelled directly south from Christmas Island, a part of Australia, it would travel a long way to the west of Western Australia and Australian Territorial waters.  The maps also showed that Ashmore Island, also a part of Australia, lies much closer to Australia than Christmas Island and directly north of it.
THE DEFENCE CASES
11Each of the accused gave evidence and stated that he did not know the other accused before boarding the vessel.  Mr Asis stated that he knew the destination of the vessel to be Christmas Island but said that he did not know that Christmas Island was part of Australia.  The applicant and Mr Armin denied knowing the vessel's destination.
12The applicant's evidence-in-chief included the following:
He lived on the island of Seram with his wife and three (now four) children (the island of Seram lies to the north of the island of Timor and well to the north-east of the island of Java).  His home has two rooms, with no bathroom.  He did not have a television, computer or radio.  He did not have a mobile phone, although his wife did.He was educated to the age of 18 and studied maps of Indonesia at school but did not recall seeing a map of Australia, nor a map that included Christmas Island.He had a job helping to operate an excavator.  If he worked a full day he was paid 100,000 Rupiah.  Prior to coming to Australia, he set out to travel from his home town to Jogja on Java to see a younger sibling but only got as far as Surabaya (on the north side of Java).  There, two people whom he did not know offered him a job to ""take a boat but at that time I did not know where to"".  He said that one of them told him that ""I would take people but at that time I did not know where to"".  He was told that he would receive 7.5 m Rupiah and would maybe be away for only two weeks.  When he asked where he was going, the boss of the two replied ""[d]on't ask questions too much if you need the money"".Having accepted the offer, he was taken by car to a beach, the whereabouts of which was unknown to him, arriving at night time, where he boarded a boat that took him to SIEV 217.  (The evidence did not reveal the location of the departure point but as a matter of inference it would appear to have been on Java).When he boarded, he went directly the engine room, his job being to look after the engine.  At no stage of the journey did he know what the vessel's destination was.  When asked whether he asked Mr Asis where the boat was going, the applicant said he did not because ""[t]hat's not my business, that's not my business"".  
13The applicant's evidence in cross-examination included the following:
At school he saw maps showing mainly Indonesia but also part of Australia.In a good week he might earn 500,000 Rupiah, but he never got to work a full month to earn 2 m Rupiah.  It might take him longer than a year to earn 7.5 m Rupiah.He was surprised that he was offered such a large sum of money for only two weeks' work but was not suspicious. He denied that he was told by the people who engaged him that the destination of the boat would be Australia.  He noticed that the boat was very crowded and knew that the people on it were passengers.  He heard them talking but couldn't understand them because they were speaking a different language.  He thought that they were tourists from a country other than Indonesia.  He thought they were tourists ""because tourists normally in Indonesia what they want is heat, sunbathing"" and he thought that the passengers on the upper deck were sunbathing.  He agreed that many of the passengers were sick and one or two of them were vomiting.He did not think that ""because they were probably from another country that they might be travelling to a country other than Indonesia"".During the journey, he did not talk to either Mr Asis or Mr Amin about where the boat was going.  He said that he thought that ""I did not have any right to ask them these sort[s] of questions so I did not ask these sort[s] of questions to them"".
THE CROWN'S CLOSING ADDRESS
14The Crown's closing address included the following:
""The Crown accepts that [Mr Zamudin's] evidence in respect of the offer was for the most part more plausible.  He did at least ask from the get go what the destination was, and his evidence was that he was told to just follow the boss.  He did at least say he was surprised by the nature of the offer, and he also gave evidence that he at least did wonder why he was the person being so fortunate as to be favoured with this most generous of offers.  But despite all that, he said he was not suspicious.  Despite the huge size of the offer - again more than a year's wages - that he was not suspicious that he might be being asked to do something unlawful.  
The Crown says you might have cause to wonder whether, in respect of his account of the offer that was being made to him, he is being truthful, or whether in fact he was told from the outset what the destination of the boat was ... "" (Transcript 19/03/12, p 168).
CLOSING ADDRESS ON BEHALF OF THE APPLICANT
15The applicant's counsel's closing address included the following:
""Members of the jury, Mr Zamudin's case is a simple one.  He did not know that SIEV 214 [sic] was going to Australia because nobody told him that that was the destination of the boat. The Crown case, likewise, as put to you by my friend, is also a simple one.  He says that Mr Zamudin did know that the boat was coming to Australia because in his words he was told from the outset what the destination of the boat was"" (AB 191).
MR ASIS' COUNSEL'S CLOSING ADDRESS 
16Mr Asis' counsel's address included the following:
""You might think that the real question in this trial is this:  is there no reasonable possibility - no reasonable possibility - that the people smugglers withheld information from Mr Asis about his true destination?  No reasonable possibility that people smugglers withheld information from Mr Asis about his true destination because the Crown case is that Mr Asis was told.  The Crown case is that Mr Asis was told he was going to Christmas Island and that Christmas Island was a part of Australia.
The Crown doesn't suggest, as I understand, that if he wasn't told that by the people smugglers he would have managed to work it out himself and I'll come back to why that would be something that you would reject quite comfortably.  So the real question becomes this, doesn't it:  is there no reasonable possibility that the people smugglers withheld information from Mr Asis about his true destination?  That is people smugglers, people who lie, people who break the law, people who are secretive for a living, and quite a good living by the sounds of it, people who are secretive for a living did not confide in an ignorant Indonesian fisherman.  No reasonable possibility that people who are secretive for a living did not confide in an ignorant Indonesia[n] fisherman?"" (AB 205)
THE TRIAL JUDGE'S SUMMING-UP
17The Summing-Up included the following:
""... It is necessary for the Crown to prove that the accused intended to facilitate the bringing or coming to Australia of a group of five or more people.  If it is proved that the accused intended to bring the people to Christmas Island, the Crown must prove either that the accused knew that Christmas Island is part of Australia, or that the accused knew that the intended ultimate destination of the people was to be Australia (Transcript 19/03/12, p 9).
...
... [The Crown Prosecutor] said that the Crown asks you to draw a conclusion from the circumstantial evidence that the only reasonable conclusion is that each of the accused must have known that the destination was Australia.  As the Crown put it, that was the real issue in the case (Transcript 20/03/12, p 3).
... [The Crown Prosecutor, referring to Mr Zamudin's evidence] said 'Could you accept this version as truthful?'  Or again, was he in fact told from the outset that the destination was Australia? (Transcript 20/03/12, p 19)
...
If I could then take you to [counsel for Mr Zamudin's] closing address in relation to Mr Zamudin, he said that his case was a simple one.  His case was he did not know he was going to Australia when on the vessel, because no-one had told him that that was the destination.  He said that the Crown case was also simple.  As he interpreted the Crown case, it was that you would be satisfied that Mr Zamudin knew beyond reasonable doubt that the destination of the boat was Australia, because you would be satisfied that the person who had recruited him had told him it was to be Australia"" (Transcript 20/03/12, p 21).
RELEVANT CASE AUTHORITIES
18In R v Razak [2012] QCA 244, the Queensland Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by a crewman on an asylum seeker vessel from his conviction of an offence under s 232A(1) of the Migration Act.  The Court concluded that ""the evidence was sufficiently cogent to allow the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had the requisite intention"" (at [18]; compare SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11] - [14] and [20]). 
19In reaching this conclusion Fraser JA (with whom Muir and Gotterson JJA agreed) said:
""[17]  ... The thesis advanced by the appellant that the vessel might have been sailing to another place within Indonesia makes little sense in light of the evidence of the passengers' uniform belief that they were being taken to Australia and the evidence that they were in fact brought over a great distance to within the vicinity of Australia near the remote and deserted Ashmore Island. The evidence certainly justified an inference that at least the member or members of the crew in control of the vessel's movements must have known that the vessel's destination was within Australia. Bearing that in mind, a variety of circumstances justified the inference that the appellant knew that the destination of the vessel was within Australia: the evidence that the appellant was employed as a cook and was one of only four crew members working together on this small vessel, the evidence that the appellant and the other crew members spoke the same language, the evidence of Ahmadi that the four crew members cooperated and worked with one another, the evidence of Eisanejad that the appellant was regularly inside the wheelhouse from which the vessel must have been navigated, and that natural human curiosity which, the jury could find, would have led the appellant to enquire about the vessel's destination if that information was not volunteered to him. None of this evidence was necessarily inconsistent with the evidence of other passengers that they did not see the appellant communicating with other crew members.""
20His Honour's observation that those in control of the vessel's movements must have known that its destination was within Australia must be understood in the context of the facts of that case where, to arrive near Ashmore Island, the vessel must have been travelling from Indonesia in the direction of mainland Australia (see [10] above).  That was not so in the present case where, to reach Christmas Island from Indonesia, the vessel would not have been travelling anywhere near the direction to mainland Australia.  Furthermore, the Crown case in Razak apparently included a contention that the appellant was told of the vessel's destination during the course of the voyage.  For reasons that I will later explain, this was not so in the present case (see [24] below).
21In Alomalu v R [2012] NSWCCA 255, this Court quashed the conviction of an asylum seeker vessel crew member of an offence of aggravated people smuggling under s 233C of the Migration Act.  In that case, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Rothman and Adamson JJ agreed) concluded that the most that could be established from evidence of conversations in that case was that the appellant was told that the passengers would be taken to Ashmore Reef.  His Honour noted that the Crown conceded that there was no evidence to establish that the appellant knew that Ashmore Reef was a part of Australia and continued:
""38 In the last decade the arrival to Australia of asylum seekers via boat from Indonesia is an issue that has received considerable focus in the Australian media. As a result, many Australians would be aware of the location of Ashmore Reef, know that it is part of Australia and be conscious of its significance as a port of entry for asylum seekers. Many Australians would readily infer that a boat that departs from a port in Indonesia with 78 passengers from Middle Eastern nations and charts a course in a southerly direction is likely to have a final destination of Australia. However, it is a different matter for a poor, itinerate worker from Indonesia. Knowledge that an Australian would have cannot be attributed without evidence to an Indonesian. The inevitable outcome is that I have a doubt about whether the appellant knew that he was facilitating the bringing of persons to Australia and that is a doubt that the jury should have had. The issue is not capable of being resolved adversely to the appellant by any advantage which the jury may have had. It follows that the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.""
RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL
22As noted earlier, the applicant appeals upon the ground that the jury's verdict that he was guilty of the offence charged was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.  To determine an appeal advanced on this ground, this Court must make an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and quality, and decide whether the Crown proved its case beyond reasonable doubt (SKA at [11] - [14] and [20]).  If the Court is left with any reasonable doubt about the applicant's guilt and the jury's verdict of guilty cannot be explained by the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the witnesses, the Court must quash the conviction (ibid).
The Crown's case at trial
23Whether there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction must be considered in the context of the case that the Crown advanced at the trial, not a case that it might have, but did not, advance.  For an accused's trial to have been fair, he or she must have had an opportunity to meet the Crown's case.  That will not have occurred if the Crown is allowed on appeal to support a conviction on a different basis to that upon which it relied at the trial.
24Analysis of the record of the trial in my view indicates that the only case that the Crown could fairly be regarded as having advanced was that the applicant was told in Indonesia, by those who engaged him for the journey, that the destination of the vessel upon which he was being asked to serve would be Australia.  In my view that is the only case upon which the Crown may rely on appeal.
25The nature of the Crown's case at trial emerges from the following aspects of the record.
26First, the only specific suggestion that was put by the Crown to the applicant in cross-examination about the vessel's destination was that he was told of it by the people who engaged him (see [13] above).  Whilst he was asked in cross-examination whether, whilst on the vessel, he talked to Mr Asis or Mr Amin about where it was going, it was not suggested to him that either of them told him of its destination.  
27Furthermore, it was not put to him that, whether or not he was at any time specifically told of the vessel's destination, it would have been obvious to him from factors such as the direction in which the vessel was being steered and the crowded conditions of the passengers that they were asylum seekers bound for Australia.  As the Crown had not previously advanced such a proposition at the trial (and indeed did not do so subsequently), the applicant did not have the opportunity to explain why it should be rejected.  As a result it would be unfair to the applicant to now allow the Crown to rely upon it (see generally Bale v Mills [2011] NSWCA 226; 81 NSWLR 498 at [39] - [48]). 
28Secondly, the Crown's closing address focused in relation to the applicant's knowledge of the vessel's destination on what it alleged he was told when he was engaged and did not contend that there were any other sources of knowledge (see [14] above).
29Thirdly, in his closing address the applicant's counsel put squarely to the jury that the Crown's case was limited to the proposition that the applicant ""was told from the outset what the destination of the boat was"" (see [15] above).  The Crown did not at that time, or subsequently, seek to correct that statement.  
30Fourthly, in his closing address Mr Asis' counsel described the Crown's case in similar terms and specifically noted that the Crown did not suggest that if Mr Asis ""wasn't told [the vessel's destination] by the people smugglers he would have managed to work it out himself"" (see [16] above).  Again, the Crown did not then, or subsequently, seek to correct these statements which the jury are likely to have understood as equally relevant to the case against the applicant.
31Fifthly, in his Summing-Up the trial judge referred to the Crown's closing address as posing the question of whether the applicant's evidence of his engagement should be accepted or whether he was ""in fact told from the outset that the destination was Australia"" (see [17] above).  Furthermore, the trial judge said that, as the applicant's counsel interpreted it, the Crown's case was that the person who recruited the applicant had told him that the destination of the vessel was to be Australia (ibid).
Whether the Crown's case at trial was proved beyond reasonable doubt
32In my view the Crown did not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was informed of the vessel's destination by those who engaged him.  
33The Crown Prosecutor acknowledged in his closing address that the applicant's evidence in respect of his engagement in Indonesia was for the most part plausible ([14] above).  However, I would go further and conclude that the whole of that evidence was plausible.  In particular, the applicant's evidence that when he asked where he was going, he was told ""[d]on't ask questions too much if you need the money"" accorded with commonsense.  As was forcefully put by Mr Asis' counsel in his closing address in relation to his client, why would people who were engaged in breaking the law by smuggling people into Australia have confided in a person such as Mr Asis (see [16] above).  It is far more likely they would have been reluctant to impart any more knowledge to others than was absolutely necessary.  There was no apparent need for intended crew such as Mr Asis and the applicant, who were not to be in charge of the vessel, to be informed of its destination.
34The Crown did not of course call any party or witness to this conversation to contradict the applicant's apparently credible evidence of it.  Nor in my view did it prove any circumstances that would require rejection of that evidence.  
35As a result, I am left with at least a reasonable doubt that the applicant was told by those who engaged him that the destination of the vessel upon which he was to serve was Australia.  There being no conflict between competing evidence about the conversation which the jury had to resolve, the jury did not in my view have any advantage in seeing and hearing the witnesses that would explain why it returned a verdict of guilty when my assessment of the record of the trial leaves me with a reasonable doubt about the applicant's guilt.  
36The adverse view about the applicant's credibility which presumably underpinned the jury's verdict of guilty did not provide that explanation as a view formed by the jury that the applicant lied would not have entitled it to regard the Crown's case as thereby established, at least where the lies were, as here, not relied upon by the Crown as manifesting a consciousness of guilt (Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193 at 201 - 202, 209; Zoneff v The Queen [2000] HCA 28; 200 CLR 234 at 244 - 245 and Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40; 217 CLR 1 [32] - [33]).  I do not regard the observation of the plurality in R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at [50] that in a circumstantial case the jury should consider all of the evidence (including that of the accused) as suggesting otherwise.
37I have indicated earlier why the decision in R v Razak is distinguishable from the present case (see [20] above).  The decision in Alomalu, although resulting, as should occur here, in the quashing of the conviction of an asylum seeker vessel crew member, is also distinguishable because the Crown's case there was not confined to an allegation that the appellant had been told of the vessel's destination when he was engaged.  
38If the Crown's case had been put more broadly in the present case, the Crown would in my view have encountered similar difficulties to those identified in Alomalu (see [21] above).  The applicant here is a poor man who lived far from the island of Java and other parts of Indonesia facing Australia.  He did not have a television, computer or radio that may have apprised him of the asylum seeker issues of which most Australians are very conscious.  Nor was he a fisherman or a person who was suggested to have associated with fishermen or other persons who may have been involved in the bringing of asylum seekers to Australia.  Moreover, the vessel upon which he was a member of the crew did not travel in the direction of mainland Australia but to an island (Christmas Island) of which he cannot be assumed to have been aware, much less to have known was part of Australia.
39In these circumstances it could not have been concluded, certainly not beyond reasonable doubt, that he knew that the vessel or its passengers were bound for Australia.  Actual knowledge must be proved, not mere suspicion (Pereira v Director of Public Prosecutions [1988] HCA 57; 63 ALJR 1 at 3).
ORDERS
40For the reasons I have given, the applicant should be granted leave to appeal and his conviction should be quashed.  As there is no basis upon which an order for a new trial could be justified, a verdict of acquittal should be entered.  
41CAMPBELL J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA, for the reasons his Honour gives, that the applicant should be granted leave to appeal, his conviction quashed, and a verdict of acquittal entered. I also agree with the additional comments of Barr AJ.
42As it is a serious step to set aside a conviction based on the verdict of a jury, I briefly wish to state my own conclusions.
43I wish to record that I have made my own independent assessment of the evidence. The question whether ""the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"" (s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)) is, as Macfarlan JA points out, one of fact. The powers of this court to grant relief may be exercised notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might have convicted. In the present case, notwithstanding the clear rejection of Mr Zamudin's evidence by the jury, I doubt that there was evidence available capable of establishing against the applicant the second element of the offence, that is, that the applicant intended to facilitate the bringing of the passengers to a destination that was part of Australia, which he knew was part of Australia.
44I agree with Macfarlan JA's analysis that the Crown case at trial was advanced on a narrow front i.e. that at the time of his engagement in Indonesia, Mr Zamudin was told by the people smugglers that the destination was Australia: see Macfarlan JA at [24]. The applicant denied this and though the jury must have rejected his evidence in that regard, this is surprising given that the Crown acknowledged that the applicant's account, at least about those details, was plausible (Appeal Book 187.45 - 188.5).  
45At trial, the Crown, notwithstanding the concession of the plausibility of Mr. Zamudin's account of his engagement, submitted that the jury should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was not telling the truth because of evidence he gave about other matters which the Crown submitted was ""simply absurd"":  AB 189.15.  The Crown submitted that this evidence damaged the applicant's credibility to such an extent that they should ""reject also his denials of knowledge of the destination of the boat beyond reasonable doubt"".  
46As Macfarlan JA points out at [36], in some circumstances, lies told by an accused may be taken as evidence manifesting a consciousness of guilt.  The Crown neither below nor on appeal relied upon that body of law, and therefore, it goes without saying, no direction relevant to that matter was sought or given. Moreover, the general rule is that the rejection of the testimony of the accused does not of itself permit an inference of guilt to be drawn. As counsel for the applicant pointed out in supplementary written submissions, the general rule was expressed by Kirby J (Sheller JA and Dowd J agreeing) in R v Anderson [2001] NSWCCA 488; 127 A Crim R 116 at [25] - [26]. It is sufficient to summarise the rule by quoting the concluding part of the direction his Honour thought customarily should be given when an accused has given evidence (at [26]):
...if you do not believe the accused, then you should put his testimony to one side. The question will remain; has the Crown, upon the basis of evidence that you do accept, proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt? 
As the other authorities, which need not be set out here, referred to by learned counsel indicate, there is a substantial body of law establishing the correctness of this approach.  
47At trial, the crown prosecutor said (AB 178 15-25]:
So I suppose what I should say is that there's no direct evidence in the Crown case to prove that [any of the crew] knew that the destination of the boat was Australia. How then does the Crown go about proving its case in respect of what the state of mind of each of the accused was? Well, his Honour will give you more detailed directions about this, but I think for present purposes I can be of some assistance in saying that what the Crown would ask you to do is to draw a conclusion from all the circumstances of the journey - in other words, from the circumstantial evidence - that the only reasonable conclusion you can draw is that each of the accused must have known that the destination of the boat was Australia.
48But even allowing for the rejection of the evidence of the applicant as a whole, what other circumstance was there to prove that the applicant was told at or about the time of his engagement that the boat's destination was Australia?
49To answer this question learned senior counsel who appeared for the Crown on appeal cited Fonseka v The Queen [2003] WASCA 111; 140 A Crim R 395 where Wheeler J said (at 398 [15]):
In my view, evidence as to the state of mind of persons on the vessel about their destination was capable of being circumstantial evidence against the appellant. As his Honour pointed out during the course of argument, if 68 people on a bus have a view that the bus has Claremont as its destination, it is a reasonable inference that the 69th person shares that view. So with the vessel, the understanding of others on the vessel was capable of giving rise to an inference about the appellant's state of mind in relation to that issue. Where the evidence related to the state of mind only of one other person on the vessel, it was obviously of less weight, but it could not in my view be said to have no weight whatever. The understanding of the person Gray as to the vessel's destination was therefore in my view a relevant fact. 
50Senior counsel pointed out that Wheeler J's dictum was referred to by Fraser JA in R v Razak [2012] QCA 244 at [17], at least in footnote 5.   Macfarlan JA has set out the material part of Fraser JA's judgment at [19], and points out material factual and evidential differences between this case and that at [20]. (See also [37] of his Honour's judgment). And, as I have said, I agree with his Honour's reasons.
51Moreover, in Zolmin v R [2012] QCA 355, McMurdo P (Holmes and White JJA agreeing), at [49], pointed out in relation to Wheeler J's approach:  
Murray and Hasluck JJ agreed with Wheeler J that Fonseka's appeal should be allowed but on another ground. They did not join in Wheeler J's observations set out above. Those observations are therefore obiter and this court is not bound by them. Whether evidence is admissible as a piece of circumstantial evidence will depend on the admissible relevant evidence in each particular case. In the present case the passengers and the appellants spoke different languages and were unable to and did not communicate with each other about their destination or any issue other than food and cigarettes. The fact that five passengers believed they were travelling to Australia does nothing in this case to prove the appellants' state of knowledge as to the voyage's destination.
In my view her Honour's analysis is apposite to the circumstances of the present case. The admissible relevant evidence in this case did not extend to circumstances like those discussed by Fraser JA in Razak at [17].  Nor in my view could the jury infer, having regard to the way the Crown case was put to them, ""that the Indonesian crew members, as the persons who implemented the contractual arrangements which passengers presumably entered into to be carried to Australia, would have been aware that Australia was their destination"": Razak at [18]. I repeat that the plausibility of the recruiter's response to the applicant's question at the time of his engagement, effectively ""don't ask"", foreclosed this line of reasoning.
52I acknowledge that at trial, the Crown relied upon the intention of the passengers as a relevant circumstance (AB 179.30) to be weighed with all other circumstances. But in my view it was not a relevant circumstance because the Crown case hinged on what the applicant was told when he was engaged. That was before he joined the boat. And in fact, there was no evidence of any relevant contact between the applicant and the passengers, who spoke Farsi, not Indonesian. Any later contact therefore could not form part of all the circumstances available to found the inference, and as the only rational inference, that the plaintiff was told at the time of his engagement of the boat's destination.
53As the case against the applicant was a purely circumstantial case, the exercise by this Court of its statutory powers is informed by the judgment of Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618. Neither a jury, nor an appeal court, is entitled to consider a circumstantial case ""piecemeal"": Hillier at 638 [48]. All the circumstances must be weighed; no part can be put to one side. At 639 [50] the plurality said:
...it is important to recognise that [the applicant] gave evidence at his trial. The Court of Appeal made no reference to this evidence when considering whether the jury's verdict should be set aside.  One question which the jury was bound to consider was what they made of [the applicant's] evidence. Did they believe that [the applicant] may have been telling the truth when he denied responsibility for [the victim's] death? Or were they, as the verdict revealed, positively persuaded on a consideration of all of the evidence (including his) in that case that he was not? (Emphasis in the original). 
As I have said, here the jury clearly rejected the applicant's evidence.  That is to say, they must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was not telling the truth. This is a matter which has caused me great concern when considering this case. However, I agree with Macfarlan JA that the quoted passage from Hillier does not displace the established principles I have referred to above at [46].
54I acknowledge that seeing and hearing the applicant give evidence is an advantage enjoyed by the jury, which cannot be re-created in this Court.  However, I also agree with Barr AJ who explains that in the particular circumstances of this case, the jury enjoyed no great advantage over this Court. Having reviewed the whole of the evidence, I am of the view that the rejection of the applicant's evidence is not a circumstance, whether taken alone or in conjunction with all the other circumstances, from which it was open to a jury to draw the inference sought by the Crown, as the only rational inference available, that the applicant knew the destination of the vessel was Australia because that was what he had been told when he was engaged. Indeed, the proper concession of plausibility made by the Crown at trial is a telling reason why that inference was not the only inference open on the evidence.  
55I doubt that the applicant is guilty of the crime of which he has been convicted. And in my judgment, this doubt was not capable of having been resolved at trial by the jury's advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses give evidence. On the whole of the evidence, I am satisfied that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty. There is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted (M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 494). The Court is bound to act to set aside the verdict, and like Macfarlan JA, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the proviso to s 6(1) is engaged.
56BARR AJ:  I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Macfarlan JA and am grateful to his Honour for the summary of the facts set out therein. The Crown had to prove that the appellant knew that the destination of the vessel was Australia. It limited its case by undertaking to prove that he knew that before the vessel left Indonesia because somebody had told him. There was no direct evidence of that. The principal evidence in the Crown case was that the appellant made the voyage as a member of the crew and that the vessel was steered directly to Australia. Although he was not the steersman the appellant assisted for a short time in steering the vessel.
57The appellant gave evidence through an interpreter. Unfortunately, evidence given in that manner usually lacks spontaneity and the opportunity juries sometimes have of assessing the reliability of witnesses, for example by demeanour, is lost. In those circumstances the only remaining way of assessing reliability is by asking whether the evidence might self-evidently be true and by comparing it with all the other evidence in the case. In my opinion this Court is in as good as a position as the jury in performing that task.
58The details of the appellant's evidence are set out in the judgment of Macfarlan JA. If I may summarise what is for me the most important part of it, the appellant told the Court that he asked where the vessel was going but was told not to ask if he wanted to be paid. I think that those who organise, finance and profit from voyages of this kind know that if their craft reaches Australia the members of the crew will be arrested. It seems to follow that in recruiting crew for such voyages the less said by the organisers the better.
59I have read the evidence in the Crown case. In my opinion the case was weak and I would not have been prepared to infer the essential knowledge from the evidence. However, I do not need to deal with the detail because I find plausible the appellant's evidence that he did not know. It is quite possible that he was telling the truth. I cannot therefore be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did know.
60I agree with Macfarlan JA that the appeal should be allowed, the verdict and sentence quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered.

2761533,AYIK v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 119,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
Offences and sentence
The applicant pleaded guilty to an offence that on 31 July 2010 he did knowingly take part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited substance, namely 28.75 kilograms of heroin contrary to s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life. The offence is subject to a standard non-parole period of 15 years.

2A ""large commercial quantity"" in respect of heroin is 1 kilogram. The amount involved in this instance was therefore greater than 28 times the large commercial quantity. The Agreed Facts describe the amount as ""one of the highest if not the highest non-border seizure of heroin ever recorded in New South Wales"". The wholesale value of such a quantity was in the order of $7.2 - 8 million with a street value of up to $33 million. 

3An offence of goods in custody (in relation to the possession of confidential police intelligence documents) was taken into account on a Form 1 on sentence.

4The applicant was sentenced by her Honour Judge Flannery SC on 11 May 2012. Her Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 9 years, with a non-parole period of 5 ½ years commencing 3 August 2010 and expiring 2 February 2016, and a balance of term of 3 ½ years expiring 2 August 2019.

5The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the following ground: Her Honour erred in her application of the principles of parity having regard to the sentences (and structure of those sentences) imposed on C"".

Factual background

6During the course of an Australian Crime Commission investigation into a prohibited drug distribution network in NSW, a number of telecommunications emanating from Lee Zhang were intercepted. On 28 and 29 July 2010 Zhang was in communication with the applicant. On 30 July 2010 Zhang was in regular contact with C, the applicant's co-offender.

7The applicant's role in the offence was that he stored the 28.272 kgs of heroin at his premises over a three day period (28 - 30 July 2010). On the afternoon of 31 July 2010, Zhang (who was clearly higher in the hierarchy) contacted the applicant to see if he was at home. The co-offender C then came to the applicant's home that afternoon to collect the heroin (at the direction of Zhang). When C arrived, the applicant drove his car out of his driveway and reversed C's vehicle into the rear yard of his home. The applicant then placed the heroin in a suitcase and returned to help C put it in the boot of C's car. C then drove away. Shortly afterwards, C was stopped by police and the 28.272 kgs of heroin was located.

8C was charged with the same offence as the applicant in relation to that heroin, namely, knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of prohibited drug (28.272 kgs heroin). C was dealt with on the basis that at the direction of Zhang, he had collected the 28.272 kgs of heroin from the applicant's house where it was being warehoused. When he was stopped by the police, C was in the process of transporting it to his own home (where it was proposed to be stored for three days). When sentencing C, her Honour found that he was acting under duress at the time of the offending, i.e., he participated because he truly feared for his and his wife's safety as he believed Zhang had connections with motorcycle gangs, government officials, customs and the police. A Form 1, which contained one count of knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime, was attached to this offence. It related to $10,000 found at the home of C upon his arrest. It was money which he had been paid by Zhang for his role in delivering heroin.

9C had an additional offence (not in common with the applicant) which was dealt with at the same time. It arose from an incident the day before the above offence (i.e., on 30 July 2010) when, acting upon instructions by Zhang, C had delivered eight blocks (each 350 grams) of heroin to a purchaser. Her Honour found that C was also acting under duress when this offence was committed (referred to as Count 1 in the applicant's submissions).

10C gave assistance to the authorities that was found to be ""truly exceptional"". He was allowed a combined discount of 50 percent for the assistance and plea of guilty. Her Honour also found as a consequence of his protected status, that his custody had been and would be somewhat more onerous than it would be in the normal prison population.

11C had no criminal record and was 23 years old at the time of the offences (D.O.B. 1986). Her Honour found that he had good prospects of rehabilitation, was unlikely to re-offend, and was remorseful. She concluded that he had not fully analysed his position at the time of the offences by reason of how his involvement unfolded, his relatively young age and his cultural dislocation. Her Honour stated that she was not required to increase the sentence in relation to the principal offence by ""any great extent"" in order to reflect the criminality of the charge on the Form 1. She made a finding of special circumstances on the basis that C would need an extended period on parole to readjust to life upon his release.

12C was the first in time to be sentenced by her Honour. In relation to the additional charge that C alone faced (supply large commercial quantity of drug - 2.8 kg heroin on 30 July 2010) her Honour imposed a total sentence of 4 ½ years with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 31 July 2010. In relation to the charge that C had in common with the applicant, he was sentenced to 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 ½ years commencing on 31 January 2011. There was partial accumulation of 6 months and as a result, the overall effective sentence imposed upon C was 6 ½ years with a non-parole period of 4 years.

13The effective starting point for C in relation to the charge that he had in common with the applicant was 12 years (before the 50 percent discount). 

Sentence proceedings

14Having reviewed the facts, her Honour noted that the plea of guilty had been entered at the earliest opportunity and accordingly, the applicant was entitled to a discount of 25 percent.

15In relation to the matter on the Form 1, the applicant's residential address was searched and twelve pages of a New South Wales Police Intelligence Information Package relating to two persons of interest was found and seized. The applicant's fingerprints were found on one of the pages.

16By reference to R v MacDonnell [2002] 128 A Crim R 44 at 33 her Honour noted that when determining the objective seriousness of offences involving drugs, the offender's role and level of criminality were more important than the quantity of the drugs which was not the sole or even principal determinant. In this case, she found the applicant's role to be ""a relatively limited one"". Nevertheless, the quantity of drugs involved was an important and relevant consideration.

17Her Honour found that none of the aggravating factors listed in s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 had application.

18In relation to the applicant's subjective case, he was born in 1977 and was 34. He had no criminal record. He was the youngest of three brothers and two sisters and had lost his father when he was aged 12. This had particularly affected him, since he had lost an important role model at a developmental stage in his life. After an argument with one of his siblings he left home at 16 and completed his schooling in Queensland.

19Upon his return to Sydney he worked as a machine operator and forklift driver. In 1999 he married in Turkey. Following the marriage, they returned to Australia and they have a son aged twelve and a daughter aged eight. In 2001 the applicant suffered a workplace injury to his back. He was unable to continue working and received compensation of $35,000. In 2004 he bought a tip-truck for soil deliveries, but that business did not work out.

20In 2005 he sustained a further injury to his back and has been in pain since that time. He worked as a cleaner and a truck driver before following his wife overseas in 2009. He returned to Australia in 2010 but was unable to obtain satisfactory work and was running out of money. He was performing temporary work for an employment agency until his arrest in August 2010.

21The applicant commenced using cannabis at the age of 12 after his father's death. After his marriage in 1999, he ceased using cannabis for a while but resumed its use after his work injury in 2001. He began using ice in 2004 and quickly became addicted to it. His actions became increasingly erratic and in January 2005 he was hospitalised following a psychotic episode. He subsequently abstained from drug use until his return from Turkey in 2010 when he commenced smoking cannabis, using heroin and drinking alcohol for pain relief.

22Since being in custody, he completed the Getting Smart course. He told Ms Robilliard, a psychologist, that he ""got a lot out of it"", especially the pros and cons of drug taking. He also completed three units of Certificate 1 in Information Technology and the prison education officer reported that he was ""an enthusiastic learner"". Her Honour concluded that the applicant had good prospects of not re-offending, although he would need a lengthy period on parole to ensure that he did not return to drug use and so that he could successfully re-adjust to life upon his release. Her Honour found special circumstances.

23Her Honour took into account the question of parity with Mr C. On this issue, she said:

""I sentenced Mr C in relation to count 1 on the basis that acting on instructions provided by Zhang, he delivered 2.8 kgs of heroin to a purchaser and in relation to count 2, on the basis that he transported 28.272 kgs of heroin from where it was being warehoused to the offender's home where it was proposed that it be stored for 3 days but that he did so under duress. 

Mr C assisted the authorities and for this and for his plea I reduced his sentence by 50 percent. My starting point before reducing the sentence by 50 percent was one of 12 years. 

Mr Boulten who submitted that I would conclude that the criminality of the two men is on a par or close to on par, bearing in mind that (1) Mr C faced two charges and so his was a course of conduct whereas this offender faces only one charge and (2) the matter on the Form 1 here is much less serious than the matter I took into account when sentencing Mr C in respect of count 2. 

The Crown did not disagree.

I accept that my starting point in relation to Mr C is the appropriate one here, although I have found that Mr C acted under duress which was significant, his offending was not just a one off and although I did not extend his sentence by much to reflect the matter on the Form 1 for the reasons I gave, the entry on it was more significant than the entry on the Form 1 here."" (ROS 8.9 - 9.8)

The appeal

24The applicant accepted that the effect of Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 was that the principle of sentencing parity required a comparison of the offending behaviour, the offender's background, age, criminal history and general character.

25By reference to those considerations, the applicant submitted that his role and that of C were different. He submitted that he had stored the drugs at his premises for three days, whereas C, on instructions from Zhang, purchased a bag into which to place the drugs and drove from the applicant's premises to collect the drugs. C had agreed to store the drugs at his place for three days after collection. C had engaged in a continuing course of conduct whereas the applicant was involved in a single offence. The Form 1 matter involving C was a more serious matter than that taken into account in relation to the applicant. In those circumstances, the applicant submitted, her Honour should not have used the same ""starting point"" of 12 years when formulating his sentence.

26The main focus of the applicant's submissions, however, related to Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 301 - 303 where Dawson and Gaudron JJ said:

""Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality....

...

The approach adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in this case treats or has the effect of treating the total period to be served in custody and, more particularly, the actual period to be served in consequence of the offences committed as irrelevant to the proportion which the sentences imposed on Postiglione and Savvas should bear to each other. In the circumstances of this case, the real punishment for both Savvas and Postiglione is the extra period which they must spend in prison. Due proportion cannot be determined without taking it into account. However, that is not to say that it is the only matter to be taken into account.""

27The applicant submitted that the facts of this case were very similar to those in Bell v R [2008] NSWCCA 206 where it was held at [37] that ""the application of the principle of totality does not render considerations of parity redundant"". The applicant submitted that a sentencing judge is required to have regard to the totality of the sentence imposed on a co-offender when applying the principles of parity. This was the approach of Price J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Barr J agreed) at [40]. The applicant submitted that the application of principles of parity also required her Honour to have regard to the structure of the sentences imposed on C. By reference to a diagrammatic representation of the sentences imposed on C for counts 1 and 2, the applicant submitted that except for one year (30.7.13 - 30.7.14) all of C's non-parole period with respect to count 2, was concurrent with the first offence. 

28The applicant submitted that it was this distortion in proportionality, as well as the differences already referred to, which provided a basis for his justifiable sense of grievance with respect to the sentences imposed on C when compared with that which he received.

Consideration

29As a start point, it should be noted that the ""proportion"" point now being taken on behalf of the applicant was not taken by very experienced senior counsel, who appeared on behalf of the applicant, before the sentencing judge. No submission was made then that the application of the principle of parity in the applicant's case required regard to be had to the structure of the sentences imposed on C, or that there was a need for her Honour to focus on the time that C would actually spend in custody attributable to the offence which they had in common.

30Applying the principle of parity in the conventional way, it is important to note that the applicant and C were sentenced by the same judge who gave detailed reasons for the different sentences which she imposed. Her Honour referred to their different criminality and differing subjective features. In those circumstances, an appellate court should be cautious before determining that an applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance because of a different outcome (Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227 at [78]; Williams v R [2013] NSWCCA 15 at [25] - [26]).

31Even if one accepts (which is by no means clear) that the applicant was a step lower in culpability than C, the differences between them were not such as to invalidate her Honour's start point of 12 years. Those matters (i.e. the additional charge which C faced, so that his conduct could not be dealt with as isolated and that the Form 1 offence was less serious) were more than offset by the finding that C was acting under duress in relation to both offences for which he was sentenced. Accordingly, the choice by her Honour of 12 years as the same start point for both the applicant and C, was clearly open to her. Most particularly, the criminality of the applicant was different to that of C in the light of the finding that C was acting under significant duress (Papadopoulos v R, Topcu v R [2007] NSWCCA 274).

32Approached in the conventional way therefore and comparing the sentence imposed on the applicant with that imposed on C in respect of the same offence, there is no proper basis for a finding that her Honour did not observe the principle of parity when sentencing the applicant and C.

33In relation to the structure of the sentences imposed on C, her Honour did no more than consider the principle of totality in accordance with Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. Her Honour fixed the appropriate sentence in relation to each offence and then considered issues of concurrency and accumulation. The requirement was for her Honour to structure the sentences so as to ensure that the overall sentence was appropriate for the total criminality. There was no obligation on her Honour to structure the sentences so as to also have regard to some concept of proportionality based on the actual time C would spend in custody, attributable to the offence which he had in common with the applicant.

34No support for such a proposition can be derived from Postiglione v R where the facts were quite different. Unlike Postiglione, this was not a case where both the applicant and C were serving prior lengthy gaol terms at the time of sentencing. In Postiglione Dawson and Gaudron JJ observed in the circumstances of that case, that the real punishment for each offender was the extra period they had to spend in custody. They recognised that due proportion could not be determined without taking that into account. They did, however, qualify this by saying ""that is not to say that it is the only matter taken into account"" (at 303). The circumstances in that case were very different to the present where C was being sentenced for two related offences and both the applicant and C were serving their first custodial terms. 

35The same observation is true in relation to Bell v R. As Price J made clear at [40], there was a clear difference in the criminality of the two offenders which had not been properly reflected in the sentences imposed. That is not the case here.

36In the ""proportionality"" submission, what the applicant has done is to focus upon the additional time in custody which C would spend as a result of the sentence imposed for the offence which they have in common. Another and more logical way of approaching the structure of the sentences imposed on C is that in accordance with the principle of totality, her Honour determined that only six months of the sentence imposed for the first and lesser count should be served by C, with the remainder of the sentence for that first count being subsumed by the sentence imposed for the second, more serious, count. In other words, her Honour concluded that a level of partial accumulation of six months was sufficient to reflect the additional criminality of the less serious offence in the first count.

37It is also of significance that the applicant's ""proportionality"" submission in relation to the structuring of the sentences imposed on C ignores that there is a subsequent period of parole of 2 years, solely attributable to the offence in the second count. In Henderson v R [2012] NSWCCA 65 the Court observed:

""32 ... The accumulation of a sentence, whether partially or wholly, upon another sentence does not mean that it is any less than what it is. The analysis engaged in by the Crown ignores the rationale for the principle of totality: see, for example, Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63. This was a matter that the judge was required to consider after first determining the sentences for the individual offences: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45].

33 The Crown's analysis also ignores the fact that there is a subsequent period of 18 months during which the applicant will be on parole. As Simpson J observed in R v Moore [2012] NSWCCA 3 at [38], ""a period of parole is in itself a sentence"".

38I am not persuaded that there is any marked and unjustified disparity between the sentence imposed on the applicant and that imposed upon C. The ground of appeal has not been made out.

39I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

40HALL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.

41DAVIES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2761539,Achurch v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 117,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ and GARLING J: Mr Achurch (the ""applicant"") was convicted following a trial on one count of supplying a prohibited drug (MDMA) contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (""DMT Act"") (""Count 1""). He was sentenced on that count to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years and three months commencing on 16 August 2006 and concluding on 15 November 2008. The offence carried a maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment with no standard non-parole period.

2The applicant was also convicted on one count of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (MDMA) contrary to s 25(2) of the DMT Act (""Count 2""). He was sentenced on that count to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years commencing on 16 August 2006 and expiring on 15 August 2010 with no balance of term. The offence carried a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.

3The applicant was also convicted on one count of supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) contrary to s 25(2) of the DMT Act (""Count 4""). He was sentenced to a non-parole period of five years commencing on 16 August 2007 and expiring on 15 August 2012 with a balance of term of eight years expiring on 15 August 2020. The offence carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.

4The Crown appealed against the sentences under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The grounds of appeal were as follows:

""Ground 1 - his Honour erred in failing to determine the objective criminality of Count 1;

Ground 2 - his Honour erred in failing to determine adequately where Count 2 lay in the range of objective seriousness for offences of that type;

Ground 3 - his Honour erred in failing to determine adequately where Count 4 lay in the range of objective seriousness for offences of that type;

Ground 4 - his Honour failed to have adequate regard to the standard non-parole period for Count 2;

Ground 5 - his Honour failed to have adequate regard to the standard non-parole period for Count 4;

Ground 6 - his Honour gave excessive weight to the Respondent's medical condition;

Ground 7 - the sentences are individually, and as aggregated, manifestly inadequate.""

5The Court of Criminal Appeal held that Ground 1 disclosed an error of process which could be considered in the context of the determination of the seventh ground: R v Achurch [2011] NSWCCA 186; (2011) 216 A Crim R 152 at [61]. The Court held that Grounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 were made out: Achurch at [103], [141], [161].

6In the result the Court of Criminal Appeal made the following orders:

""1. Crown appeal allowed. 

2. Sentences imposed on the Respondent in the District Court on 6 August 2010 quashed. 

3. In their place, the Respondent is sentenced as follows: 

(i) on the first count, sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years and three months commencing on 16 August 2006 and expiring on 15 November 2008, 

(ii) on the second count, sentenced to a non-parole period of six years commencing on 16 August 2007 and expiring on 15 August 2013 with a balance of term of two years commencing on 16 August 2013 and expiring on 15 August 2015, 

(iii) on the fourth count, sentenced to imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of 11 years commencing on 16 August 2008 and expiring on 15 August 2019, with a balance of term of five years commencing on 16 August 2019 and expiring on 15 August 2024. 

4. The Respondent will be eligible for release on parole on 16 August 2019.""

7Following this judgment the High Court delivered judgment in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. It will be necessary to say something more about the judgment, but for present purposes it overruled the decision of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, so far as it determined the approach to sentencing in respect of sentences which carried a standard non-parole period: Muldrock at [25]. 

8On 22 March 2012, the applicant made an application under s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""Sentencing Procedure Act""). The orders sought as set out in the Notice of Motion filed on 28 March 2012 were to the following effect:

""(1) The application to re-open the proceedings subject to the Crown appeal is granted.

(2) The sentences imposed upon the applicant by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 16 August 2011 are quashed.

(3) The Crown appeal be reheard or, subject to the orders of the Court, be re-listed for further hearing on a date to be fixed by the Registrar.""

9Section 43 of the Sentencing Procedure Act provides as follows:

""43(1) This section applies to criminal proceedings (including proceedings on appeal) in which a court has: 

(a) imposed a penalty that is contrary to law, or

(b) failed to impose a penalty that is required to be imposed by law,

and so applies whether or not a person has been convicted of an offence in those proceedings.

(2) The court may reopen the proceedings (either on its own initiative or on the application of a party to the proceedings) and, after giving the parties an opportunity to be heard: 

(a) may impose a penalty that is in accordance with the law, and

(b) if necessary, may amend any relevant conviction or order.

(3) For the purposes of this section, the court: 

(a) may call on the person to whom the proceedings relate to appear before it and, if the person does not appear, may issue a warrant for the person's arrest, or

(b) if of the opinion that the person will not appear if called on to do so, may, without calling on the person to appear before it, issue a warrant for the person's arrest.

(4) Subject to subsection (5), nothing in this section affects any right of appeal.

(5) For the purposes of an appeal under any Act against a penalty imposed in the exercise of a power conferred by this section, the time within which such an appeal must be made commences on the date on which the penalty is so imposed.

(6) In this section: 

impose a penalty includes: 

(a) impose a sentence of imprisonment or a fine, or

(b) make an intensive correction order, home detention order or community service order, or

(c) make an order that provides for an offender to enter into a good behaviour bond, or

(c1) make a non-association order or place restriction order, or

(d) make an order under section 10, 11 or 12, or

(e) make an order or direction with respect to restitution, compensation, costs, forfeiture, destruction, disqualification or loss or suspension of a licence or privilege.""

10The applicant contends that as a result of the application of the principles set out in Muldrock, the sentence imposed upon him by the Court of Criminal Appeal was contrary to law and the Court should reopen the proceedings under s 43(2) and impose a penalty in accordance with law.

11These proceedings are the first of a number of potential proceedings challenging sentences which were imposed in reliance on the principles laid down in Way. The Court has been constituted as a five person bench to consider whether it is appropriate to use the review mechanism in s 43 to reconsider such sentences.

The judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal

12The principal judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal was delivered by Johnson J. Garling J, whilst agreeing with Johnson J, made some additional observations. Macfarlan JA agreed with Johnson J and with the additional observations of Garling J.

13In relation to Count 1 which did not carry a standard non-parole period, Johnson J after referring to Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; (2011) 209 A Crim R 509, held that the principles of sentencing required at least some assessment of the objective gravity of the offence which was not done by the sentencing judge: Achurch at [59]. Johnson J described this as an error of process which could be dealt with under Ground 7.

14Johnson J upheld Grounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 and held that in this respect the impact of the errors made by the sentencing judge was significant. In the course of considering those grounds, he made the following remarks:

""[76] As the Respondent had been convicted after trial, the standard non-parole periods with respect to the second and fourth counts had direct application by force of statute, and not merely as a guidepost on sentence following a plea of guilty: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at 184 [68]. 

[77] When sentencing for offences for which Parliament has provided a standard non-parole period, it is necessary for Judges to specify where the offences lie on the range of objective seriousness for those crimes: R v Sellars [2010] NSWCCA 133 at [12]; R v McEvoy at [87]. 

[78] The sentencing Judge imposed non-parole periods for the second and fourth counts which were very significantly below the standard non-parole period for each offence. The further downwards the sentencing Judge moves from the standard non-parole, the greater the need for close examination of the findings, in particular concerning the objective seriousness of the offence: R v Knight [2007] NSWCCA 283; 176 A Crim R 338 at 341 [4]. There is, of course, a statutory obligation to give reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period: s.54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

[79] With respect to the second count, a standard non-parole period of 10 years was prescribed. The sentencing Judge initially imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for four years. After the inability to make such an order had been raised by the Crown, his Honour stated that a non-parole period of four years would be fixed. 

[80] In reality, his Honour set a fixed term of imprisonment, an approach which was contrary to statute: s.45(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; Hristovski v R [2010] NSWCCA 129 at [7]. 

[81] Accordingly, error has been demonstrated concerning the sentence imposed on the second count. Further, I am satisfied that error has been demonstrated with respect to the reasons given by the sentencing Judge concerning the role of the standard non-parole period on sentence. His Honour explained why such a non-parole period (effectively a fixed term) was imposed because 'this offence is significantly less substantial in terms of culpability than a mid range offence for such an offence'. 

[82] The sentencing Judge had made no specific findings concerning the offence contained in the second count. As a result, this conclusion was opaque. Although Mr Brady made submissions by reference to the facts of the second count in support of a contention that this finding was open to the sentencing Judge, these were not findings made by his Honour and, in my view, do not leave reasonably open the conclusion expressed by his Honour to explain the sentence passed on this count. This error was compounded by the finding of 'special circumstances' recorded on the back of the indictment, said to be because the criminality of the offence was 'well below mid range of seriousness'. Such an approach involved a clear and impermissible double counting of this factor. More to the point, his Honour did not fix any balance of term. The sentence was, in reality, a fixed term. 

[83] I am satisfied that error of process, and error in substance, has been demonstrated concerning the sentence passed on the second count. 

[84] With respect to the fourth count, counsel for the Respondent conceded that one of the two factors referred to by the sentencing Judge did not bear upon the objective seriousness of the offence so that error was demonstrated in this respect. There was a live issue in the District Court as to whether the fourth count lay above the mid-range (the Crown submission) or below the mid-range (the defence submission). His Honour did not refer to this controversy or resolve it. An analysis of these submissions, in my view, could not place this offence below the mid-range.""

15Johnson J upheld Ground 6, holding that it was not open to the sentencing judge to find that this was an exceptional case which ""permitted, in reality, the Respondent's medical condition to become the dominant and controlling factor on sentence at the expense of the objective seriousness of his crimes"": Achurch at [140].

16Johnson J upheld Ground 7, holding that the sentences in respect of Counts 2 and 4 were manifestly inadequate. However, he was not persuaded that this was the case in respect of the sentence imposed for Count 1. In relation to Counts 2 and 4 he made the following comments:

""[155] I am persuaded that an effective fixed term of imprisonment for four years on the second count is manifestly inadequate in the circumstances of this case. Although that offence involved an offer to supply 1,000 MDMA pills without an actual supply being involved, it is important to bear in mind that agreement to supply or offers to supply prohibited drugs each constitute transactional activities that play an important and central role in the chain of drug trafficking: Vu v R [2006] NSWCCA 188 at [88]. The sentencing Judge found that the Respondent was a principal in relation to the second count and that he was motivated by profit. The Respondent was convicted after trial and the standard non-parole period had direct application. In my view, it was appropriate to place this offence at the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The Respondent was entitled to a measure of mitigation because of his medical condition. Beyond that, there was really nothing operating in the Respondent's favour on the subjective side of the case.

...

[157] The fourth count involved a very serious offence where more than two-and-a-half times the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine was to be supplied. I am well satisfied that a non-parole period of five years is manifestly inadequate for this offence.""

17Johnson J then proceeded to resentence the applicant in the manner in which we have indicated. In doing so he made the following remarks:

""[165] In my view, having regard to the objective seriousness of the second offence and after taking into account the Respondent's subjective circumstances, a non-parole period of six years ought be imposed for this offence. As the Respondent's medical condition has been taken into account in the determination of sentence, it is not appropriate to double count that factor in his favour by way of a finding of 'special circumstances' under s.44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: R v Way at 201 [185]. Accordingly, for this offence, the appropriate sentence is one of a non-parole period of six years with a balance of term of two years. 

[166] In my view, the fourth count may be properly characterised as lying in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The Respondent is entitled to have his subjective factors, principally his medical condition, taken into account to mitigate penalty. In my view, a non-parole period of 12 years is appropriate for this offence. Once again, the Respondent is not entitled to have his medical condition double counted in his favour by way of a finding of 'special circumstances'. For this offence, I would impose a non-parole period of 12 years with a balance of term of four years.""

18Garling J, whilst agreeing with Johnson J, made the following additional remarks:

""[179] The difference in the sentences imposed by the trial judge and that thought appropriate by this Court, focuses attention on the existence of, and role to be played by, standard non-parole periods. 

[180] A standard non-parole period is to be considered together with the maximum penalty imposed by the legislature for an offence: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at 182 [50]. The statutory maximum, here life imprisonment, reflects the seriousness of the offence in the eyes of the public and the policy of the legislature: Way at [53]. 

[181] The standard non-parole period, here 15 years imprisonment, is the legislature's expression of its intention as to the minimum period of actual imprisonment: Way at [53]. 

[182] The consequences of the prescription of a standard non-parole period is, or may well be, to change, by increasing, an established sentencing pattern: Way at [54], R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575. 

[183] Whilst the existence of a standard non-parole period is not again a mandatory sentence, nevertheless where the relevant offence, as was here the case, falls within the mid-range of objective seriousness, and the conviction follows a trial, then proper attention must be paid by a sentencing judge to the legislation, and to the two statutory benchmarks and reference points, namely the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period. 

[184] In this case, insufficient weight was given by the learned sentencing judge to these matters with the result that his sentence was to a significant degree manifestly inadequate.""

The issues in the application

19The issues raised by the application may be summarised as follows:

1 What is encompassed by the phrase ""imposed a penalty that is contrary to law"" in s 43(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act?

2 Was the penalty imposed in the present case contrary to law?

3 If the answer to the second question is in the affirmative and the Court exercises its discretion to impose a penalty in accordance with law, is the penalty imposed by reference to the circumstances as they existed at the time the primary judge imposed the original sentence, or is it imposed by reference to the circumstances which exist at the time the discretion under s 43(2) is exercised?

4 If the answer to the second question is in the affirmative, what sentence should be imposed?

Legislative background

20We have set out s 43 of the Sentencing Procedure Act above. The power to reopen proceedings when a penalty imposed was contrary to law has its origins in this State in s 100HA of the Justices Act 1902, which commenced on 1 January 1987. In the course of the Second Reading Speech introducing the section, the Attorney General made the following comments:

""The purpose of this bill is to amend the Justices Act to give magistrates the power to reopen the hearing of a criminal matter following the imposition of a penalty which is contrary to law. A magistrate in this State does have limited power to reopen a hearing, but this is only where a conviction or penalty has been recorded in the absence of the person. The bill does not, therefore, introduce a completely new power, but extends the jurisdiction to those cases where a sentencing error has been made. The provisions of the bill are similar to those currently existing in Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland. The proposed section 100HA will allow an application to be made to a magistrate for the reopening of a hearing by either party where it is contended that the sentence imposed was contrary to law. The magistrate will also be able to reopen the matter without any application having been made. This does not mean that these provisions can be used in order to review a sentence or to allow either party to have another bite of the cherry. It will only allow the magistrate to correct a sentence which is patently in error.

...

...There may be, from time to time, other cases where the need to correct technical errors will occur. 

As I have already said, the power can in no way be used to review a sentence where the defendant is of the opinion that it is too heavy or where the prosecution feels it is too light. The power can be used only where there has been a mistake.

...

...The bill will allow for the quick, efficient remedy of technical errors without imposing further large costs upon the parties involved.""

21The power contained in s 100HA of the Justices Act was extended to all Courts by the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act 1988. This Act replaced s 100HA by inserting s 19 into the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which commenced on 26 February 1989. That section and the sections which replaced it have been in substantially the same form as the present s 43 of the Sentencing Procedure Act (although the current s 43(3) commenced with the Sentencing Procedure Act on 3 April 2000 and there have been a number of amendments to s 43(6) none of which are relevant for present purposes). In the Second Reading Speech introducing s 19 of the Criminal Procedure Act, the Attorney General made the following comments:

""... It is important to note that this provision can only be used where there has been a technical error in the sentence imposed. The new section cannot be used to review a penalty by way of appeal. An example of such an error is the imposition of a disqualification period below that which is required by the Motor Traffic Act 1901. This is a quite different mechanism to that of appeal.

...

The new section provides that on its own motion or on the application of either party, the court can reopen the proceedings. The parties are then given an opportunity to be heard. The section also provides that the time within which any appeal is required to be made under any Act shall commence from the date upon which the new penalty is imposed. This is important legislation. The need for it has been highlighted by the introduction of the Probation and Parole Act 1983. The complexity of this and other legislation that judicial officers have to grapple with in the courts on a daily basis has invariably led to technical errors being made. It is vital that judicial officers have a simple procedure available to them to correct such errors. The Government has identified a gap in law in this area and has moved quickly to close it. The legislation will be a useful tool of the Justices Act and throughout the judicial system.""

22It would appear in this material that it was not the legislature's intention for the section to have a broad operation. It is necessary to interpret the words of the statute in context and to not substitute the words of the relevant Minister's Second Reading Speech: Re Bolton; Ex parte Beane [1987] HCA 12; (1987) 162 CLR 514 at 518; Saeed v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] HCA 23; (2010) 241 CLR 252 at [31]-[32]. However, the words of the statute are capable of being read narrowly. The expression ""contrary to law"" would on one view refer to a sentence which could not be lawfully imposed as distinct from one arrived at by an erroneous process of reasoning. This would include sentences falling outside a statutory maximum or minimum provided for by legislation or a miscalculation of start dates or parole periods. Such a construction derives some support from context; in particular, the fact that the power under the section is conferred on the same court which imposed the penalty and, most importantly, on the existence of a right to appeal against sentence contained in s 5(1)(c) and s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act.

23However, courts have consistently given what is now s 43 of the Sentencing Procedure Act a broader interpretation. Neither party has submitted that any of the cases which gave a broad interpretation were incorrectly decided.

Judicial consideration of s 43 and its interstate equivalents

(a) New South Wales

24In R v Petrou (Court of Criminal Appeal, 13 February 1990, unreported), the sentencing judge fixed a non-parole period he was not empowered to fix in conjunction with a head sentence he had imposed. On being made aware of this error, the sentencing judge exercised the power under the then predecessor to s 43, s 19 of the Criminal Procedure Act, to impose a new head sentence consistent with the non-parole period he thought appropriate. On appeal, each of Finlay J and Hunt J (as his Honour then was) said the section should be construed liberally. Hunt J stated the purpose of the section in the following terms:

""Section 19 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 was, it seems to me, inserted by the legislature primarily in order to permit the judge who made the original error to correct it, without the affected party having either to appeal or to rely upon some administrative action being taken to ensure that the proper penalty is imposed. The section does, of course, permit errors to be corrected on appeal as well, but the object to which I have referred appears to me to have been paramount. Against that background, the definition of 'penalty' which the section itself provides should, in my view, be read as widely as possible to include any necessary part of the sentence imposed.""

25The third judge, Allen J, agreed with each of the other judges.

26Although each of the judges in Petrou said that the section should be construed liberally, the use made of the section in that case was to do no more than correct a technical error which had led to the head sentence being one which could not be lawfully imposed.

27In R v Denning (Court of Criminal Appeal, 15 May 1992, unreported) the sentencing judge imposed a penalty on the appellant, who was then serving a life sentence and certain other sentences, which was contrary to law by reason of misinformation given to the sentencing judge about the determinative sentences then being served. It was common ground that the sentence was a penalty contrary to law within the meaning of s 24, the then predecessor to s 43 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. The sentencing judge exercised his power to resentence but in doing so declined to take into account events which had occurred between the time the original sentence was imposed and the time of resentencing. Each member of the Court agreed that the sentencing judge had erred in failing to take subsequent events into account, although they differed as to the outcome. In relation to the question of whether subsequent matters should be taken into account, Carruthers J made the following remarks:

""It was submitted to Judge Shillington on behalf of the applicant that in determining whether he should exercise his powers under s.24, he should take into consideration the events which had occurred after 21 July 1989 and receive in evidence the material (such as the report by Dr Wendy Roberts) which was before Wood J. directed towards the applicant's rehabilitation. His Honour rejected these submissions expressing the view that if the correct information had been placed before him on 21 July 1989 he would have directed that the sentence imposed by him commence at the expiration of the accumulated twenty-one and a half years. His Honour took the view that his function under s.24 was confined to the correction of the error which occurred.

In my respectful view, his Honour made an error of law in this regard. Section 24 posed two questions for the Court. Firstly, there was the question whether the earlier proceedings should be reopened. In the event that such question was answered in the affirmative, there was the question whether the Court should amend the earlier order. Particularly bearing in mind that two years and four months had expired since the earlier order was made, it was, in my view, incumbent upon his Honour to receive evidence of what had relevantly transpired in the intervening period. The proceedings before Wood J. were unquestionably relevant, as was the cogent evidence of rehabilitation.""

Smart J dealt with the matter as follows:

""The judge in re-sentencing applies the law which existed at the time the original sentence was imposed he takes into account the circumstances of the offence or offences and the position at the time of the imposition of the original penalty. However, he must consider what has happened since that penalty was imposed and the circumstances which then exist. The court is not limited to the position as at the imposition of the original penalty. Different considerations govern appeals. Inter alia, time limits apply to appeals and applications for leave to appeal by prisoners and substantial delay is often fatal to a Crown appeal. Further, under s. 24, the original sentence was not in accordance with the law and the reconsideration represents the first occasion on which a penalty in accordance with the law is imposed.

When the court is considering the imposition of a penalty that is in accordance with the law, the court does not simply look at the penalty originally imposed, decide whether it was in accordance with the law and, if not, what the correct penalty would have been at that date. The court looks at all the circumstances including what has happened since the imposition of the original penalty.""

Grove J in agreeing with the other members of the Court emphasised that it does not strain the provision to give the fullest relief which could be comprehended within the concept of correction.

28R v Tolmie (1994) 72 A Crim R 416 was a successful Crown appeal. The error that was the subject of the successful appeal was pointed out to the sentencing judge who was requested to review the sentence under the then equivalent of s 43. Hunt CJ at CL said the section did not permit a rehearing on the merits: Tolmie at 420. Smart J adhered to the views he expressed in Denning, whilst Badgery-Parker J did not express a view on the question.

29In Ho v Director of Public Prosecutions (1995) 37 NSWLR 393, Kirby P, with whom Gleeson CJ and Sheller JA agreed, dealt extensively with the construction of the then predecessor to s 43, s 24 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

30His Honour (at 402-403) made six observations concerning the operation of s 24, five of which are relevant to the present case:

""(1) The section appears in remedial legislation designed to permit, as Pt 7 of the Act makes clear, 'Correction of sentencing errors'. Given the remedial purposes of the section, it should not be subjected to a narrow construction: see R v Petrou (Court of Criminal Appeal, 13 February 1990, unreported).

(2) That a broad interpretation of the section was intended by parliament is confirmed, not only by the general purpose of the section and the broad definition of terms provided in s 24(7) of the Act. It is also confirmed by the Second Reading Speech of the Attorney-General introducing the measure: see New South Wales Parliamentary Debates (Legislative Assembly), 21 September 1988 at 1673. He stated that its object was to provide 'a simple procedure to correct sentencing errors in criminal proceedings'. He went on to explain:

'The availability of this procedure will enable matters to be dealt with expeditiously. It will relieve appellate courts of unnecessary work and is a further step in the implementation of the Government's undertaking to reduce court delays. ... It is an important and practical step and savings to the Government and the administration of justice will be substantial.'

These considerations are not irrelevant given the limitations upon the facility of appeal in criminal matters such as the present, and the limitations upon (and technical requirements of) judicial review as well as the public and private costs that are involved in correcting mistakes of a simple character by such procedures. Reinforced by the minister's explanation of the legislation to parliaments this Court should afford the language of the section the broadest available construction so as to achieve its stated objects;

(3) There are limits relevantly derived from the requirement that the penalty must be 'contrary to law'. Such limitations have been revealed in earlier cases: see, eg, Boyd v Sandercock; Ex parte Sandercock [1990] 2 Qd R 26, where the Queensland Full Court analysed the equivalent provisions of s 147A of the Justices Act 1886 (Qld). In the end, the Court must adhere to the requirements of Parliament as expressed in the statutory language: Re Bolton; Ex parte Beane (1987) 162 CLR 514 at 518. It must do so even if this results in a conflict with the stated intentions of the minister;

(4) It is to be noted that the phrase used in s 24(1)(a) is not 'imposed a penalty that is not provided by law'. A broader adjectival phrase is used to describe the 'penalty' which authorises the application of the section. It is enough that that penalty is 'contrary to law'. It is a part of the law of sentencing that where a person has, in respect of an event of which that person is convicted and stands for sentence, already served some time in custody, the sentencing judge should take such period into account. Ordinarily, the judge should give credit to the offender for time already served. To fail to consider this is an error of law in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The resulting penalty is then one 'contrary to law';

(5) Differing views have been expressed by judges concerning the breadth of the phrase 'contrary to law' in s 24. Certainly, the section is not intended to permit a general rehearing of sentencing proceedings on the merits: see, eg, Shortland v Heath [1977] WAR 61 at 62f; R v Williams; Ex parte Biggs [1989] 1 Qd R 594 at 597. Differences were also expressed by the members of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Tolmie (1994) 72 A Crim R 416 at 420, 421. However, whilst avoiding a re-hearing of the merits of the penalty, it is common ground that the purpose of the section is to permit the correction of mistakes where 'such correction would have saved the cost, delay and expense involved in having to institute an appeal' (see R v Tolmie (at 420)) or, I would add, in being obliged to seek judicial review. For the correction of arguable mistakes in sentencing, the section should be given the widest possible operation.""

31Two matters should be noted. First, Kirby P stated that the section should be given the widest possible operation. He considered that the words ""contrary to law"" had a broader operation than ""not provided by law"", and stated that an error of law in the exercise of sentencing discretion means the resulting penalty is contrary to law. Second, notwithstanding the width of the provision, he did not consider the section extended to permit a rehearing on the merits. That would tend to support the limitation placed on the operation of the section by Hunt CJ at CL in Tolmie. The same limitation was held to apply to the section by this Court in R v Smith [2004] NSWCCA 69 at [40] (per Studdert J, McColl JA and Howie J agreeing).

32In R v Finnie (No 2) [2004] NSWCCA 150 Howie J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Dunford J agreed, extensively reviewed the authorities considering the section and agreed that it should be given a liberal interpretation. His Honour reached the following conclusions:

""[31] In my view there has not been disclosed any error of law made by this Court in the sentencing of the respondent which would attract the operation of s 43. It is not a case such as Ho v DPP where the Court failed to take into account a relevant sentencing fact or principle. Nor is it a case where this Court incorrectly applied a relevant sentencing principle or applied a principle later found to have been erroneous. This Court had a discretionary decision to make on the material before it as to when the sentences imposed by it were to commence. Provided that discretion was exercised in a principled way, and there has been no suggestion that it was not, no error of law could arise. 

[32] There is no doubt, in my mind, that the section can be engaged as a result of an erroneous finding of fact or an omission to find, or take into account, a relevant fact. As Angel J points out, the section does not use the expression 'error of law'. Further, there is no requirement that any error be identified except in the outcome of the sentencing proceedings. It does not matter whether the sentencing court made a mistake of law or of fact in arriving at a penalty that was contrary to law or in failing to impose a penalty in accordance with the law. It is not difficult to imagine a situation where a sentencer misunderstood or overlooked a fact in evidence before the court and as a result imposed a sentence that fell within the scope of the provision. A not uncommon example would be where the failure to take into account the existence of a particular traffic conviction resulted in the court failing to impose the disqualification period mandated by statute where such a prior conviction exists. Where a relevant error is established, the section is engaged and, at least in so far as the jurisdiction of the court to reopen the sentencing proceedings is concerned, it is unnecessary for the court to determine how the erroneous sentence came about.""

33In R v Tangen (Court of Criminal Appeal, 21 June 1996, unreported) Badgery-Parker J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Hidden J agreed, gave the provision a similarly wide interpretation. His Honour also considered that matters which had occurred after the original sentence was passed should be taken into account:

""If it were necessary to choose between the views expressed by the court in Denning, and the possibly more restrictive views of s24 expressed by the President and by Hunt, CJ at CL in Ho and in Tolmie respectively, I would prefer the former which appears to me more readily to accommodate the full purpose of s24. In any event, as counsel for the appellant pointed out, the remarks in both Ho and Tolmie were clearly obiter. This court should, in my view, follow Denning and should, in the words of Grove J. construe the section 'so as to include scope for the fullest relief which fairly can be comprehended within the concept of correction'. That means, in a case such as Denning, where much time has passed between the original sentencing and the re-opening of the sentencing proceedings, that the court must be not only at liberty to, but bound to, have regard to what has transpired in the interim; and, in a case where the delay problem does not intrude, must at least be authorised by the section to amend the sentence, and if necessary entirely to re-sentence, in order to produce that result which the sentencing judge originally intended to be achieved by the sentence which he originally but invalidly imposed.""

34It should be noted that in that case there was a concession during the course of argument that the Court could take into account matters which occurred after the original sentence.

35In Erceg v District Court (NSW) [2003] NSWCA 379; (2003) 143 A Crim R 455, McColl JA, with whom Palmer J agreed, stated that the section should be given the widest possible construction. Her Honour stated that in the resentencing process, matters occurring subsequent to the original sentence should be taken into account following Tangen and Denning, in preference to the more restrictive views in Ho and Tolmie: Erceg at [104]-[107]. The third judge, Sheller JA, did not consider the question.

36The section was most recently considered by the Court of Appeal in this State in Meakin v Director of Public Prosecutions [2011] NSWCA 373; (2011) 216 A Crim R 128. In Meakin, it was submitted that a District Court judge erred in refusing to reopen sentencing proceedings under s 43 on the basis that an automatic disqualification period imposed under the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 had not been taken into account. The Court held that there was no error in refusing to reopen in circumstances where the matter had not been raised in the original sentencing proceedings. However, Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) made the following comments concerning s 43:

""[27] Section 43 is a remedial legislative provision and is to be given a broad construction so as to achieve its legislative purpose, namely, the provision of a simple procedure to correct sentencing error: see R v Tolmie [2004] NSWCCA 396; Ho v DPP (1995) 37 NSWLR 393, per Kirby P at 402; Erceg v The District Court of New South Wales & Anor [2003] NSWCA 379; 143 A Crim R 455. See also the Second Reading Speech, where the Minister stated that the object of s 43 was to provide a 'simple procedure to correct sentencing errors' and as a means of 'correcting mistakes of a simple character' (New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 21 September 1988 at 1673). 

[28] Section s 43 is not concerned with the correction of all sentencing errors. Rather, the section is engaged where there is a sentencing error that falls within the terms of the statute, namely, where the court had imposed a sentence that was 'contrary to law' or where the court had failed to impose a penalty that was required to be imposed by law: see R v Finnie (No 2) [2004] NSWCCA 150. It is the former error that is in issue in this case, that is, whether the sentence relating to the licence disqualification period was imposed 'contrary to law'. 

[29] Section 43 is not confined to error in respect of the existence or terms of a statutory provision. It is sufficient that the penalty imposed was contrary to principles of law as expounded in the case law: see Ho per Kirby P at 402-403. See also Staats v The Queen (1998) 123 NTR 16; Melville v The Queen (1999) 150 FLR 296. In Ho Kirby P pointed out at 403, in obiter comments in respect of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 24 (the predecessor provision to s 43), that the phrase 'contrary to law' is wider than the phrase 'imposed a penalty that is not provided by law'. His Honour referred to the common law sentencing principle that where, prior to sentence, a person has spent time in custody in respect of an offence, the trial judge should take the period of pre-sentence custody into account. Ordinarily, credit should be given for the time served. A failure to consider this would be an error of law in the sentencing discretion and the resulting penalty would be 'contrary to law' within the meaning of s 43. 

...

[92] A failure to be aware of such statutory provisions may result in a sentence that is manifestly inadequate or excessive. It is a different question as to whether that constitutes a sentencing error that is 'contrary to law' within s 43. In my opinion, that question can be answered fairly readily. As I have discussed, the effect of the authorities is that s 43 looks to the outcome of the proceedings. It is the sentence imposed which must be 'contrary to law'. That is, there must be an error in the sentence imposed with the consequence that some different sentence is required. Thus a sentence that is greater or less than that prescribed will be a sentence imposed that is 'contrary to law'. For example, if a sentence is imposed in respect of a high range PCA, when the offence was a mid or low-range PCA, there will be a sentence imposed that is 'contrary to law'.""

37On one view, her Honour in [92] was expressing a somewhat narrow view of the scope of s 43. However, her remarks in that paragraph must be read in conjunction with her earlier comments. Rather than expressing a narrow view, her Honour was focusing on the fact that the provision looks to the outcome of the proceedings and the fact that what needs to be considered is the lawfulness of the sentence as distinct from the process of reasoning on which the sentence was based. 

38A number of other cases have recognised that there are limitations on the width of the section. In R v Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297, the sentencing judge erred in imposing the same sentence for an offence in which the applicant was a principal in the second degree as one which he imposed for an offence in which the applicant was a principal in the first degree. The Court declined to remit the matter to the sentencing judge to correct the error and had reservations as to whether s 43 could be used for that purpose: Skaf at [44].

39In Wise v R [2006] NSWCCA 264, the original sentencing judge fixed the sentence without imposing a non-parole period as required by s 44(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act for reasons that did not comply with s 45(1) of that Act. Subsequently after a breach for a recognizance, another judge purported to vary the sentence imposed by fixing a non-parole period. It was held that he had no power to do so. Rothman J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Howie J agreed, explained the position in the following terms:

""[14] Further, if the original sentence by Blackmore DCJ was imposed contrary to s.44(1) or s.45(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the provisions of s.43 of that Act would be available to reopen the proceedings and re-sentence according to law: s.43(2)(a). However, Charteris DCJ did not have this power because, as previously stated, the original sentence of Blackmore DCJ purported to give a reason in accordance with the requirements of s.45(2) of the Act. While the reason given was inadequate and not one which would allow a judge not to fix a non-parole period, the sentence was not 'contrary to law' for the purpose of s.43. It was a sentence that suffered from error of law which required correction on appeal, but only on appeal.""

This case seems to be the only authority which gives direct support to the narrow construction of the section to which we have referred in [22] above.

(b) Interstate cases

40Each party in their submissions referred to a number of interstate cases dealing with equivalent provisions. A number of those decisions concerned the extent to which the equivalent sections could be used to correct errors of fact, an issue which does not arise in the present case.

41In Staats v The Queen [1998] NTCCA 13; (1998) 101 A Crim R 461, Martin CJ (at 469) said that the equivalent section in the Northern Territory was limited to errors of law in relation to the imposition of the sentence and that it did not extend to the correction of reasons or the review of the exercise of a discretionary judgment. Angel J (at 471) stated that it at least extended to an error of law.

42In Melville v The Queen [1999] NTCCA 55; (1999) 9 NTLR 29, the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Northern Territory, whilst holding it had no jurisdiction to correct an error made by the sentencing judge, considered the scope of the equivalent section. Kearney J, with whom Martin CJ and Priestley J agreed, reached the following conclusions:

""[27] In my opinion, the Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australian authorities - see pars [22] and [23] - and what was said in Staats (supra) in par [24] support the view that s 112(1) empowers the sentencing court to correct errors of law. I consider, bearing in mind Kirby P's observations in Ho v Director of Public Prosecutions (supra) in par [23], that those errors encompass errors of the type said to have arisen in this case. That is to say, s 112(1) enables the correction of an error of law in sentencing when, in the course of a binding decision in the appellate hierarchy in another case, it is stated that the sentence in the instant case was not imposed in accordance with the law which governs the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion. I consider that this beneficial interpretation of s 112(1)(a), a remedial provision, results in its operation being fairer and more convenient; this interpretation provides in the Territory a convenient means of correcting an error of this type. The operation of a statute is relevant to the meaning to be given to its terms; see generally Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v The Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1981) 147 CLR 297 at 320-321, per Mason and Wilson JJ.""

43Subsequently in Melville v The Queen [1999] NTSC 56; (1999) 105 A Crim R 421, Kearney J granted relief under the section. The circumstances were somewhat similar to the present case. The error of law which led to the application was that subsequent to the original decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissing Mr Melville's appeal against sentence, the High Court in Siganto v R [1998] HCA 74; (1998) 194 CLR 656 overruled the basis upon which the appeal was dismissed. However, Kearney J at [13] took the view that he could not take into account changed circumstances since the date of the original sentence in resentencing Mr Melville.

The parties' submissions

44The applicant submitted that although s 43 was often used to correct minor sentencing errors, its scope is far wider. The applicant relied in that context on the cases that we have referred to above in submitting that the section should be given the widest possible interpretation; in particular, Meakin, Finnie (No 2), Denning, Erceg, Ho and the Northern Territory cases. The applicant submitted that Erceg and Meakin correctly stated the scope of the section. In these circumstances, the applicant submitted that it was appropriate to correct sentences passed on an incorrect application of Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act and, in particular, sentences affected by the error identified by the High Court in Muldrock. 

45The applicant submitted that the passages of the judgment of Johnson J and Garling J which we have set out above, demonstrated that the Court in hearing the appeal adopted the approach to standard non-parole periods identified as erroneous by the High Court in Muldrock. In particular, the applicant submitted that the Court erred in holding that the sentencing judge was in error by: (i) upholding Grounds 2 and 3 of the Notice of Appeal; (ii) giving determinative significance to the nominated standard non-parole periods; (iii) adopting an erroneous approach to the assessment of objective circumstances; and (iv) overstating the significance of the fact that the applicant had been convicted after a trial.

46In supplementary submissions the applicant submitted that Grounds 2 to 5 of the appeal in light of Muldrock should have been dismissed. The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge, consistent with what was declared to be the correct approach in Muldrock, took into account the existence of the standard non-parole period as well as the maximum penalty for the offence.

47In relation to Ground 6, the applicant said that what was required of the sentencing judge, consistent with the approach identified in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 378, was to identify all factors relevant to the sentencing decision, discuss their significance and make a value judgment as to the appropriate penalty. The applicant submitted that the primary judge in fact undertook this task and pointed to factors considered by the primary judge. In particular, the applicant submitted that the primary judge:


""Noted the actual charges that the applicant had been convicted of committing...
Observed that as a consequence of his pleas of not guilty, the applicant was not entitled to any reduction for the utilitarian value of the pleas...
Noted the particular standard non-parole periods that applied to counts 2 and 4...
Observed that the maximum penalty for count 4 was life imprisonment...
Recited the offender's criminal history and observed there was nothing in his history akin to the gravity of count 4...
Noted that co-offenders had been dealt with but their circumstances were not comparable because the offender was a principal...
Concluded that no sentence other than full time imprisonment was appropriate...
Recited the facts...
Concluded the conduct was organised criminal activity, but that it was a 'bumbling enterprise'...
Accepted that damage and injury would have been caused had the drugs entered the community...
Characterised the offender's contact with the criminal law as 'a life of persistent minor criminality' except for one offence of armed robbery...
Noted the very substantial delay between the offender's arrest and sentence, a period of almost four years on remand...
Reviewed the offender's subjective circumstances...
Analysed the extent of his health problems...
Considered Dr Luxton to be well placed to proffer the opinion that:
The offender has advanced kidney disease with a high likelihood of progression to dialysis dependence.
His medical conditions put him at risk of severe illness and early mortality.
That whilst dialysis will be available as a prisoner the gaol environment may not provide optimal medical care.
It is reasonably likely that prolonged incarceration will significantly reduce his life expectancy, although the number of variables made it not possible to quantify this...
Observed that he had been referred to authorities dealing with imprisonment of persons with illnesses and indicated that he understood that in the case of very serious illness, such as to constitute a threat to life and a grave impairment of the quality of life. In such cases what was required was a sentence of imprisonment no longer than is necessary to serve the purposes of punishment...
Concluded that the illnesses suffered by the offender were 'sufficiently significant' to constitute an exceptional reason why, in sentencing for the principal offence, it was appropriate to set a non-parole period 'significantly lower than otherwise would be the case'...
Decided to impose concurrent sentences for counts 1 and 2.
Partially accumulated the sentence for count 4.
Backdated the sentences to 16 August 2006, the date the offender entered custody.""

It was submitted that in that context the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on Ground 6 was arrived at because of the role attributed to the relevant standard non-parole periods.

48In relation to Ground 7, the applicant submitted that the conclusion that the sentence was manifestly inadequate was arrived at because of the determinative significance of the standard non-parole period. The applicant accepted that the non-parole period imposed by the sentencing judge extended considerable leniency, but submitted that the reasons extracted in par [47] above warranted his conclusion. The applicant submitted that there was no double counting as a result of the finding of special circumstances based on the health of the applicant, as the head sentence remained very substantial.

49The applicant properly accepted that in considering these matters the Crown was entitled to recast the grounds of appeal against the sentence imposed to take account of what was decided in Muldrock.

50The Crown submitted that s 43 did not apply. First, it submitted that s 43 is directed to error in the sentencing process which has led to the imposition of a sentence that is measurably wrong with a consequence that some different sentence is required. The Crown submitted that s 43 was not applicable when the error did not have any operative effect on the length of the sentence, or when the error could, rather than must, lead to a different penalty. Second, it submitted that there was no operative error of the type identified in Muldrock. 

51The Crown submitted that it was not the legislative intention that s 43 would cut across the regime for criminal appeals. It submitted that if the expression ""contrary to law"" were taken to include any error of legal principle appearing in the exercise of sentencing discretion, it would encourage the regular re-agitation of sentencing proceedings before the Court. It submitted that in those circumstances, the appropriate construction of s 43 was that endorsed by Allsop P and Beazley JA in Meakin and discussed by Hunt CJ at CL in Petrou and Tolmie.

52The Crown submitted that what was sought in the present case by the applicant was in effect a rehearing on the merits. It highlighted the difficulty that in the present case the appeal was allowed on multiple bases, only some of which related to the sentencing judge's approach to the standard non-parole periods. It pointed to the fact that the significance of the non-parole period may vary from case to case: R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [21]. In that case Basten JA also noted that the Court in Muldrock supra did not suggest that a conventional assessment of the objective offending according to a scale of seriousness was to be eschewed: Koloamatangi at [19]. Further, the Crown submitted that courts have made it clear that, notwithstanding the engagement of the two-step process of reasoning contrary to Muldrock, the sentences imposed may be correct: Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 172 at [2]; Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 at [26].

53Dealing with the present case the Crown submitted that in respect of Grounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 no proper assessment was made of the objective gravity of the offence. The Crown submitted that the Court of Criminal Appeal correctly held that the sentencing judge erroneously took into account subjective factors in assessing the objective gravity of Count 4 and gave excessive weight to the fact that the drugs were intercepted prior to distribution. The Crown submitted that the Court of Criminal Appeal correctly held that insufficient weight was given by the sentencing judge to the matters referred to by Johnson J in support of his finding of objective seriousness, namely, the principal role of the applicant in the drug operation, the large quantity of drugs, the profit motive and the fact that the supply was not an isolated incident. The Crown submitted that an instinctive synthesis approach to sentencing would yield the result arrived at by the Court of Criminal Appeal.

54In supplementary submissions filed in anticipation of the hearing on 4 December 2012, the Crown submitted that when the objective seriousness of the offending is considered together with the applicant's subjective case and the statutory guideposts of the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period, the Court would conclude that the sentence imposed in R v Achurch supra was appropriate and would impose the same penalty.

55Alternatively, the Crown submitted that if the Court considered the correct course was to reconsider the District Court sentence, then a reformulated Crown appeal would lead to the same conclusion. It pointed to the factual findings made by Johnson J to which we have referred above, and submitted that in those circumstances a finding that Counts 2 and 4 were in the midrange of objective seriousness was justified. The Crown repeated its submission that assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence remains an essential element of the process of instinctive synthesis in sentencing. The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge erred in holding that the offence was significantly less substantial in terms of culpability than a midrange offence. It submitted that the sentence imposed failed to reflect the criminality involved in the offence and was manifestly inadequate in the sense that it was unreasonable or plainly unjust.

56In her submissions at the hearing, counsel for the Crown did not challenge any of the decisions to which we have referred above and accepted that s 43 should be given a liberal construction. However, she submitted the focus has to be on the penalty imposed rather than the process of reasoning which led to its imposition.

Consideration

57We have set out the issues raised by the application in [19] above. We shall deal with each of them to the extent necessary in turn.

Question 1: What is encompassed by the phrase ""imposed a penalty that is contrary to law"" in s 43(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act?

58The construction of s 43 must begin with a consideration of the text itself which is the surest guide to legislative intention. The question may require consideration of the context, which includes the general purpose and policy of the provision and the mischief it is seeking to remedy: Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Limited v Commissioner of Territory Revenue [2009] HCA 41; (2009) 239 CLR 27 at [47].

59The use of the words ""contrary to law"" in s 43(1)(a) and ""required to be imposed by law"" in s 43(1)(b) could be read as extending no further than to either the imposition of penalties which there was no power to lawfully impose, or failing to impose a penalty which was mandatory to impose in the circumstances. That limited construction derives some support from the fact that it is the court which imposes the sentence that has the power to reopen the proceedings. In addition, the provision in subs (4) states that subject to subs (5), s 43 has no effect on any right of appeal. It also deals with the mischief which the Second Reading Speech indicated was intended to be dealt with by the legislation.

60However, the words in question are open to a wider interpretation and courts have consistently construed the section more liberally.

61In circumstances where no challenge is made to those decisions it would be inappropriate to construe the provision in the narrow fashion to which we have referred. These cases make it clear that the section can apply in circumstances where the penalty, whilst within the range of penalties which as a matter of power could be imposed, is not one which would be imposed if correct sentencing principles were applied.

62That does not mean that s 43 is a proxy for an appeal. On a sentence appeal, once error is established s 5D and s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act provide that the court, if it is of the opinion that some other sentence whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor. By contrast, the jurisdiction conferred by s 43(1)(a) of the Sentencing Procedure Act only arises if the penalty imposed is contrary to law.

63The difference, in our opinion, is this. In an appeal against sentence under s 5(1) or s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act, the jurisdiction to impose a different sentence is enlivened upon error being demonstrated, although the court must be satisfied that a different sentence is warranted in law. By contrast s 43(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act focuses on the outcome. For there to be jurisdiction, error must be identified and it must be shown that the error led to a penalty which was not otherwise open to the court to impose.

64Such a conclusion, in our opinion, gives effect to the words of the section. It is also consistent, in our opinion, with the approach taken by Beazley JA in Meakin at [92], the decision in Wise, and the statements made by Kirby P in Ho and Hunt CJ at CL in Tolmie that the section does not entitle an applicant to a rehearing on the merits. The construction also does not appear to us to be inconsistent with any of the other decisions considering the section or its equivalents to which we have referred above (see [24]-[43]).

65It must be accepted that such a construction involves consideration of the matters which arise under s 43(2) in determining whether or not the precondition to jurisdiction contained in s 43(1) is satisfied. However, that seems to be inevitable once it is accepted that the jurisdiction is wider than the narrow construction to which we have referred in [59] above.

66In that context one other matter should be noted. Section 43 is a discretionary provision designed principally, in our opinion, to correct manifest error. Generally speaking the only circumstances in which it should be exercised is where the error in question is apparent from the sentence itself, not from an analysis of the legal reasoning which underpins the sentence. Thus it would be available to correct sentences which fell outside statutory minimum or maximum penalties or where it is an error of computation or the like. It should not be used as an alternate to an appeal. To do otherwise would effectively lead to a lack of finality in criminal proceedings and potentially bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

67It follows that s 43 should not be used as a vehicle to review what might colloquially be described as Muldrock appeals with a possible exception of cases where it is alleged the Court of Criminal Appeal erroneously sentenced on the basis of Way. In the case of sentences imposed by other Courts the appropriate course, in our opinion, is for an application for leave to appeal to this Court to be made out of time. It would be up to the Court hearing the application for leave to establish whether it was appropriate for leave to be granted. 

68Notwithstanding, it is appropriate in the present case to consider whether the preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction under s 43 of the Sentencing Procedure Act are made out. This is for two reasons. First, the court in question is the Court of Criminal Appeal which subject to special leave to the High Court being granted is the final court of appeal for criminal matters. Second, as we stated earlier, the case has been brought before the court to enable it to consider whether an application under s 43 is an appropriate method to deal with applications for resentencing by persons who claim they have been wrongly sentenced as a result of the application of the principles laid down by this Court in Way.

Question 2: Was the penalty imposed in the present case contrary to law?

69The answer to this question depends on two subsidiary questions. First, was there error in the reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal in allowing the appeal? Second, if there was, did it lead to the imposition of a penalty that is contrary to law?

70In our opinion, the reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal did demonstrate error. Paragraphs [76], [77] and [78] of the judgment of Johnson J which we have set out above, demonstrate that his Honour was applying the approach to sentencing for offences with standard non-parole periods set out in Way which was overruled in Muldrock. In particular, the High Court held that the standard non-parole period was no more than a legislative guidepost contrary to par [76] of his Honour's judgment. The focus on the standard non-parole period in pars [77] and [78] also seems to us to place it as a benchmark above and beyond its use as a legislative guidepost forming one of the factors to be taken into account as part of the approach to sentencing described by McHugh J in Markarian at 378. This was said to be the correct approach in Muldrock at [26]. Further, the approach by his Honour in pars [76]-[78] seems to adopt the two stage approach to sentencing suggested in R v Knight [2007] NSWCCA 283; (2007) 176 A Crim R 338 at [4] and R v Sellars [2010] NSWCCA 133 at [11], which was said to be inappropriate in Muldrock at [25]-[28].

71Similarly, Garling J in his additional remarks expressly stated that the correct approach to sentencing was that set out in Way. 

72Further, it may be assumed in these circumstances that the Court in determining that the sentence was manifestly inadequate adopted the approach suggested in Way, Knight and Sellars in resentencing the applicant. This is apparent from the statement by Johnson J in par [76] that the standard non-parole period had direct application in relation to Counts 2 and 4. It is also apparent from what appears to be the two stage approach adopted in resentencing on Count 4 (par [166]).

73It follows that the reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal was erroneous having regard to the subsequent decision in Muldrock. However, that still leaves open the question of whether the penalty was contrary to law. It would be contrary to law if the application of the correct principles led to the conclusion the Crown appeal should have been dismissed. If on the other hand after applying the correct principles it remains that the sentencing judge was in error in his approach to sentencing, then the relevant question is whether or not the Court of Criminal Appeal sentencing in accordance with the correct principles could have imposed the penalty which was in fact imposed on the applicant.

74It is convenient to first consider the question of whether the penalties imposed were contrary to law. This question involves a consideration of all of the facts, matter and circumstances relevant to the imposition of the sentence by the Court of Criminal Appeal.

75It was obvious from the facts that the applicant was engaged in the supply of illicit drugs, in effect, on demand. He employed others to assist him in this illegal enterprise. In particular, he stored drugs at premises which he once occupied, but which, by the time of the activities referred to in Count 4, were occupied by one of his ""employees"". When those premises were searched, in addition to the indicia of drugs supply and sale, including a notebook which constituted a drug ledger recording amounts of monies and drugs, 2.6 kilograms of methylamphetamine were found in a garage of the premises. The garage was guarded by several dogs and the drugs were concealed in a rather sophisticated way in six individual resealable plastic bags.

76The total quantity of drugs discovered at those premises was two and a half times the large commercial quantity of the drugs.

77The sentencing Judge found correctly that the offences ""... were all organised and planned, these were not 'one off' activities. The sequence of events points to planning ..."". His conclusion that the offences were not spur of the moment activities, but were organised, was well justified. 

78These conclusions were amply based on the facts that the applicant employed others to undertake his work for him, engaged in sophisticated means of guarding the drugs which were hidden, and adopted covert language when describing his dealings on the telephone. 

79It is relevant to note that the applicant was 47 years old at the time of the offences, and is now 54 years old. He has a significant prior criminal history, including a number of terms of full-time imprisonment. His past record includes armed robbery.

80Prior to his arrest for the present offences on 16 August 2006, the applicant was released from custody on 17 May 2005, having served a term of imprisonment for receiving, goods in custody and possession of a prohibited weapon and a prohibited drug. The offences for which the respondent was before the Court, were committed in the period from 7 March 2006 to 30 May 2006. He had been released from his latest period of imprisonment for less than 12 months before he embarked upon the commission of these offences.

81The principal issue so far as the applicant's subjective circumstances were concerned, related to his complex state of health and his medical conditions. 

82At the time of original sentencing in the District Court, the sentencing judge found that the applicant had the following medical conditions:

(a)Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (insulin dependent, with associated medical complications);

(b)Hypertension;

(c)Left ventricular hypertrophy;

(d)Congestive cardiac failure;

(e)Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease due to smoking; and

(f)Peripheral Vascular Disease and Dyslipidaemia.

83At that time, it was anticipated that within the next few years the applicant would require dialysis treatment for his chronic kidney condition. At the hearing of the Crown appeal before the Court of Criminal Appeal, these conditions continued. Additional medical evidence was adduced by both the applicant and the Crown. 

84Johnson J at [129] was satisfied that the two reports of Dr Luxton, fairly read, did not suggest any health difficulty for the applicant from the likely need for dialysis whilst in custody, but rather that the potentially adverse factor related to a potential difficulty in managing the applicant's fluid and dietary needs. 

85As Johnson J made clear in [135], this Court has repeatedly held that ill health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime nor should offenders expect to escape punishment because of their ill health. Johnson J in [140] concluded that it was not reasonably open to the sentencing Judge to sentence the applicant on the basis that this was an exceptional case which permitted the applicant's medical condition to be the dominant and controlling factor on sentence at the expense of the objective seriousness of the offence. 

86It was not submitted that these conclusions were erroneous. Rather, the argument was advanced that insufficient weight had been attributed to the state of the applicant's health in resentencing by the Court of Criminal Appeal.

87This Court has considered the correct approach to sentencing of offenders in cases where the offender has a serious health problem which is to be managed within the prison system. These principles acknowledge that there is a tension between the priority which the medical profession gives to a person's health, and the priority which this Court in the furtherance of the criminal justice system gives to it, because the criminal justice system has at its heart the welfare of the community generally and its protection: see R v Higgins [2002] NSWCCA 407; (2002) 133 A Crim R 385. 

88In dealing with the issue, this Court said in R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 at [18] that:

""One of the relevant considerations in determining what, if any, weight to give to [poor physical health], will be the seriousness of the offence. Another will be whether the medical condition existed at the time of the offence, and whether it has deteriorated in the period between the offence and sentence. Common humanity will sometimes require a court to consider a life-threatening physical illness as a matter of mitigation, even though the offender was suffering from such an illness at the time of the commission of the offence. 

However, where ...the issue is one of the protection of the community, it may be that common humanity for the offender gives way to concern for potential victims.""

89The evidence before the sentencing Judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal did not permit of any conclusion that, with the exception of the need for Justice Health to manage and regularly monitor the applicant's fluid and dietary needs, there was any particular threat to the applicant's health which could not be adequately managed whilst in prison. The most significant feature of the applicant's health was that it was likely that his chronic kidney disease would require treatment by dialysis. Dialysis treatment by qualified staff is provided by Justice Health. Such treatment is overseen by specialists.

90A careful review of the medical evidence does not permit of any conclusion that the applicant's life expectancy would be foreshortened by the fact that he was in custody. 

91Although in this Court, the applicant argued that the sentencing Judge in the District Court had correctly exercised his discretion with respect to the weight to be given to the applicant's medical condition, we are unable to agree. Acceptance of the applicant's submissions would involve a finding that Johnson J's conclusions, on the this issue, were erroneous. 

92We are well satisfied that clear error was demonstrated by the Crown with respect to the sentencing Judge's approach in the District Court on this issue. The reasoning of Johnson J was correct, and no error has been shown. The decision in Muldrock did not touch upon or affect the reasoning of Johnson J in respect of this medical condition issue. It follows, that an application of the correct principle would not have lead to the Crown appeal being dismissed. On the contrary, it was correctly upheld.

93The issue which is now relevant for consideration is whether the Court of Criminal Appeal, applying correct principles, could have imposed the penalty for the offences which were in fact imposed on the applicant. In assessing this, it is necessary to draw attention to the matters of objective seriousness to which earlier reference has been made. As well, it is necessary to have regard to all of the other facts and matters which relate to this applicant. 

94At the time of the offences the applicant was 47 years old. He is now 54. He had a lengthy prior criminal history including three counts of armed robbery. 

95The offences were part of a planned and organised criminal activity committed for financial gain. The applicant showed no contrition. It cannot be said that the applicant has good prospects of rehabilitation. On the contrary, his past criminal record, and the seriousness of the offences of which he was convicted, tell against his prospects of rehabilitation. 

96The maximum terms of imprisonment, 20 years on Count 2, and life imprisonment on Count 4, and the standard non-parole periods applicable, namely 10 years on Count 2, and 15 years on Count 4, are legislative guideposts. The maximum penalty serves as an indication of the relative seriousness of the offence. 

97We are satisfied that an assessment of the objective criminality of these offences, and their seriousness, in light of what we have recounted, can properly be described as mid-range. 

98We have also had regard to all of the factors that are relevant to sentence. Those that are of particular significance and relevance have been discussed. Engaging in the ""intuitive synthesis"" sentencing approach required by Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 378 [51], we are satisfied that the sentences which were imposed in the Court of Criminal Appeal were within the reasonable discretion of that Court and could in accordance with correct principle, have been lawfully imposed by the Court.

99 In our opinion the sentencing judge erred in his approach to sentencing such that the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act was enlivened. Further, the penalty imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal was appropriate and thus not contrary to law within the meaning of s 43(1)(a) of the Sentencing Procedure Act.

Question 3: If the Court determines that the penalty imposed was contrary to law and exercises its discretion to impose a penalty in accordance with law, is the penalty imposed by reference to the circumstances as they existed at the time the primary judge imposed the original sentence, or is it imposed by reference to the circumstances which exist at the time the discretion under s 43(2) is exercised?

100As this question does not arise, it is unnecessary to express a final view. However, our tentative view is that any penalty should be imposed by reference to the circumstances as they existed at the time of the original sentence rather than by the circumstances which exist at the time the discretion came to be exercised.

101In our opinion, this approach is consistent with the fact that the power under s 43 of the Sentencing Procedure Act is more limited than the power of the court hearing an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act. The power to impose a sentence that should have been imposed invites attention to the position as it was at the time of the original sentence. This, in our opinion, is consistent with what was said in Ho and Tolmie that the section does not provide for a rehearing on the merits. However, in circumstances where there is a conflict of authority on the issue and the matter does not directly arise, it is not necessary to express a final view.

Question 4: If the answer to the second question is in the affirmative, what sentence should be imposed?

102This question does not arise.

Orders

103In the circumstances we propose that, the following orders should be made:

1 The application made by the applicant under s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on 22 March 2012 be dismissed.

2 The Notice of Motion filed by the applicant on 28 March 2012 be dismissed.

104McCLELLAN JA: I have had the considerable benefit of reading, in draft, the reasons of Bathurst CJ and Garling J and the additional remarks of Johnson J. I agree with the orders proposed by Bathurst CJ and Garling J but wish to express my own reasons for dismissing the application.

105As the judgment of Bathurst CJ and Garling J acknowledges, this Court has consistently given s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 a broad interpretation. The intermediate courts of appeal in other jurisdictions have likewise given a broad interpretation to equivalent provisions in their criminal appeal statutes. Johnson J's careful analysis of the extrinsic material reveals that the broad interpretation ascribed to s 43 by this Court is at odds with Parliament's intent in enacting the provision.

106The preponderance of case law suggests that reasoning process errors, including errors of the kind described in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499, will furnish sufficient grounds for a court to reopen sentencing proceedings under s 43: see, for example, Erceg v District Court (NSW) [2003] NSWCA 379; (2003) 143 A Crim R 455; R v Finnie (No 2) [2004] NSWCCA 150 at [31]-[32] (Howie J, Spigelman CJ and Dunford J agreeing); R v Tangen (Court of Criminal Appeal, 21 June 1996, unreported); Ho v Director of Public Prosecutions (1995) 37 NSWLR 393 at 402-403 (Kirby P). Even if interpretive aids such as statutory context and the Minister's Second Reading Speech might point to a narrower construction of s 43, this Court cannot reconsider the scope of s 43 in circumstances where neither party has challenged the correctness of previous decisions concerning its application.

107To my mind, this Court is bound by previous decisions to interpret s 43 in such a way that it encompasses errors of the type identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120, however contrary to Parliament's intention that interpretation may be. However, no previous decision of this Court denies the fundamentally discretionary nature of an application brought under s 43 of the Act. It is always open to the Court of Criminal Appeal, or any other court called upon to reopen sentencing proceedings under s 43, to dismiss the application because it considers that other avenues of appeal for which the Criminal Appeal Act provides are better adapted to the issues an applicant seeks to raise. 

108Where an applicant seeks to argue that his or her sentence is affected by Muldrock error, the appropriate course is for the applicant to seek leave to appeal to this Court under s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act. That course is appropriate because of this Court's position at the apex of the State's criminal appeal hierarchy and the questions of principle involved in determining appeals that allege error of the type identified in Muldrock. The considerations of finality to which Bathurst CJ and Garling J refer at [66] of their reasons are also relevant in this regard. These are all compelling reasons why a lower court should, generally speaking, refuse an application to reopen sentencing proceedings where the applicant seeks to demonstrate that the reasoning process which underlay the sentence was erroneous. I agree with the Chief Justice and Garling and Johnson JJ that s 43 should ordinarily be reserved for the correction of patent error or, to use an administrative law term, that species of error known as ""error of law on the face of the record"". 

109Accordingly, although it is technically open to a court to reopen sentencing proceedings to correct for Muldrock error, it will not ordinarily exercise that discretion where doing so would bypass the avenue of appeal for which s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides.

110Having said that, this is no ordinary case. The applicant submits that the Court of Criminal Appeal, rather than the original sentencing court, fell into error in resentencing the applicant on the basis of the erroneous decision of R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, and s 5(1)(c) is therefore of no avail to the applicant. Accepting that it may be appropriate in such a case to entertain an application to reopen the proceedings in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I would nevertheless dismiss the application because the sentence was not, for the reasons given by Bathurst CJ and Garling J, one that could not have been imposed bearing in mind the correct approach to sentencing set out in Muldrock.

111JOHNSON J: I have had the considerable advantage of reading, in draft, the judgment of the Chief Justice and Garling J. I agree with their Honours' reasons and proposed orders. 

112I wish to explain, in a little greater detail, my reasons for supporting the conclusions of the Chief Justice and Garling J (in particular at [66]-[67]) concerning the operation of s.43 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

113I have found troubling the determination of the issues posed by this application. Despite the clearly expressed narrow purpose of the statutory predecessors to s.43, to be found in available extrinsic material, the provision has been given a broad construction in decisions of this Court and the Court of Appeal.

114From time to time, in considering s.43, Courts in this State have accepted the reasoning of decisions of intermediate appellate Courts in other States and Territories where there are equivalent provisions. Courts in other States and Territories have applied decisions of this Court or the Court of Appeal in construing analogous provisions in those jurisdictions.

115In this way, a body of jurisprudence has developed concerning the construction of provisions such as s.43. As the Victorian Court of Appeal has observed recently (although there is no s.43 equivalent in that State), provisions of this type have been given a broad interpretation in Australian jurisdictions where there are such provisions: Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v Edwards [2012] VSCA 293 at [106]-[108], [218]-[220].

116The comity principle applies where intermediate appellate Courts of other jurisdictions have construed provisions, in State or Territory legislation, which are identical or substantially similar to New South Wales provisions: Fernando v Commissioner of Police (1995) 36 NSWLR 567 at 584B, 587E, 589G, 593C; R v NZ [2005] NSWCCA 278; 63 NSWLR 628 at 664-668 [155]-[168]. There has been, in effect, a process of mutual acceptance of decisions concerning the construction of provisions substantially similar to s.43 in different Australian jurisdictions.

117The parties before this Court did not submit that any earlier decision of a Court should be overruled. This Court is not bound by its earlier decisions or by decisions of the Court of Appeal, although it should only depart from them if satisfied that they are clearly wrong: R v Mai (1992) 26 NSWLR 371 at 380-381; Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 490-491 [83]-[85]. We were not asked to so conclude in this case.

118Accordingly, I acknowledge and accept the conclusions of the Chief Justice and Garling J based upon these earlier decisions. However, that does not mean that s.43 is available for ready use by first-instance courts as a substitute for an appeal. The discretionary remedy in s.43 may apply readily to patent, technical or calculation errors. Beyond that, the statutory scheme in this State for appeal from, or review of, sentences is a powerful and controlling consideration where a s.43 application invites a Court to consider arguments moving beyond these limited classes of error.

119What follows is intended to emphasise the importance of the discretionary brake which applies where a s.43 application is made. Two particular features will be emphasised. Firstly, the narrow origins of the provision, and the need to ensure that the provision is not used as a proxy for an appeal. Secondly, the nature and scope of appeals from, and review of, sentencing decisions on indictment will be addressed, to allow a clearer understanding of areas where s.43 ought not have practical operation.

The Origins of s.43

120The principle of finality is a fundamental aspect of the justice system, applicable to sentencing as well as other areas of criminal and civil law: Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227; 214 A Crim R 191 at 194 [5]. Once sentence is passed, a sentencing Judge is functus officio, subject to appeal or review or application of any statutory or common law principle which allows correction of any order made: Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v Edwards at [156]-[157].

121In this case, the Court of Criminal Appeal had determined a Crown appeal against sentence under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The s.43 application is brought with respect to orders made in upholding that Crown appeal.

122The Chief Justice and Garling J have referred (at [20]-[22]) to the legislative history of s.43 and its predecessor provisions. 

123As noted at [58], the construction of s.43 commences with a consideration of the text itself, with regard to its context, including the general purpose and policy of the provision and the mischief it was seeking to remedy. Context is to be understood in its widest sense, including the existing state of the law: CIC Insurance Limited v Bankstown Football Club Limited [1997] HCA 2; 187 CLR 384 at 408. The context of s.43 includes the statutory scheme for appeals against sentence in this State: cf Network Ten Pty Limited v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited [2004] HCA 14; 218 CLR 273 at 280-281 [11]-[13]. 

124In the 1986 Legislative Assembly second reading speech concerning s.100HA Justices Act 1902 (referred to by the Chief Justice and Garling J at [20]), the Attorney General, Mr Sheahan, said that the section ""will only allow the magistrate to correct a sentence which is patently in error"". The Attorney General observed that such ""a provision is necessary because on occasions magistrates are handing down sentences which they do not have the power to impose"". 

125The Attorney General pointed to two specific areas of sentencing which had highlighted the problem to be addressed by the legislation. These were periods of disqualification under the Motor Traffic Act 1909 and sentences passed under the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981. In the area of disqualification, mistakes were being made by Magistrates by way of imposition of periods of disqualification which were less than the prescribed statutory minimum period. In the area of periodic detention, sentences of imprisonment by way of periodic detention had been imposed even though the person was not eligible for periodic detention in accordance with the statutory criteria. The Attorney General continued (at page 3592) (emphasis added):

""These are two examples of the types of situations where the power contained in this bill might be required. There may be, from time to time, other cases where the need to correct technical errors will occur.""

126The second reading speech in the Legislative Council concerning s.100HA Justices Act 1902 was delivered by the Hon JR Hallam. The Minister commenced his second reading speech in the following way (Legislative Council, 18 November 1986, Hansard, pages 6512-6514) (emphasis added):

""At present, there is no simple mechanism in the Local Courts for the correction of technical sentencing errors. This has meant that a defendant who receives an invalid sentence must use up the precious time of the Supreme Court in having the sentence quashed and the matter reheard. The purpose of this bill is to remedy this situation by giving magistrates the power to reopen a hearing where a sentence that has been imposed is contrary to law.""

127Soon after, the Minister observed that errors to which the provision would apply ""are those which occur when a magistrate purports to impose a penalty not within his or her power"". 

128After noting the two areas mentioned by the Attorney General in the Legislative Assembly (disqualification and periodic detention), the Minister concluded the second reading speech in the following way (emphasis added):

""I emphasize again that the power given by this bill cannot be used as a general power of review or as an appeal process. The power to reopen exists only where there has been a patent error of law in the sentence imposed. The bill will allow for the quick and effective correction of errors made in sentencing in the local courts. It is of benefit to defendants who, through no fault of their own, receive sentences that are invalid. It is also of benefit to the community by reducing the demands on the precious time available in the higher courts of this State.""

129In 1988, the provision contained in s.100HA Justices Act 1902 was relocated and inserted as s.19 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, with application to all courts exercising criminal jurisdiction. 

130In the course of the second reading speech, the Attorney General, Mr Dowd, said (Legislative Assembly, 21 September 1988, Hansard, pages 1673-1674) (emphasis added):

""It is important to note that this provision can only be used where there has been a technical error in the sentence imposed. The new section cannot be used to review a penalty by way of appeal. An example of such an error is the imposition of a disqualification period below that which is required by the Motor Traffic Act 1901. This is a quite different mechanism to that of appeal.""

131In explaining the purpose of the provision, the Attorney General referred to a further area of mischief to which the provision could apply (emphasis added):

""The new section provides that on its own motion or on the application of either party, the court can reopen the proceedings. The parties are then given an opportunity to be heard. The section also provides that the time within which any appeal is required to be made under any Act shall commence from the date upon which the new penalty is imposed. This is important legislation. The need
for it has been highlighted by the introduction of the Probation and Parole Act 1983. The complexity of this and other legislation that judicial officers have to grapple with in the courts on a daily basis has invariably led to technical errors being made. It is vital that judicial officers have a simple procedure available to them to correct such errors. The Government has identified a gap in law in this area and has moved quickly to close it. The legislation will be a useful tool of the Justices Act and throughout the judicial system.""

132It may be observed from the second reading speeches concerning the 1988 amendments that it was not said that s.19 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 was to have wider application than s.100HA Justices Act 1902, with the obvious exception that the former provision applied to all courts and not just the Local Court. 

133It is noteworthy that the Probation and Parole Act 1983 attracted specific mention in the 1988 second reading speech. The complications of that statute were notorious. As Kirby P observed in Larkin v Parole Board (1987) 10 NSWLR 57 at 58, there ""are few less satisfying tasks than the elucidation of the Probation and Parole Act 1983"" with its ""tortuous language being the subject of numerous judicial cris-de-coeur"". The complications which that statute presented to sentencing Judges imposing terms of imprisonment (involving calculations and starting dates) were such that there lay within the Act an unusual provision which allowed the Parole Board to amend the sentencing order of a court in the case of ""patent error"": Riley v Parole Board of New South Wales (1985) 3 NSWLR 606; Larkin v Parole Board. It may be no accident that express reference was made in the 1988 second reading speech to the ability of the then s.19 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to allow a sentencing court to correct errors under the Probation and Parole Act 1983. I observe that the types of error under that Act were technical (usually mathematical) ones concerning calculations and starting dates. The types of error did not lead to a re-exercise of sentencing discretion in accordance with one set of principles in place of those applied in the original sentence. The process was invariably one of adjustment only.

134In 1989, the Probation and Parole Act 1983 was repealed and the Sentencing Act 1989 was enacted, with its ""truth in sentencing"" object: R v Maclay (1990) 19 NSWLR 112 at 121-122. What was considered to be a more straightforward statutory sentencing regime was implemented.

135Although the provision enacted in 1988 was moved (and became s.24 Criminal Procedure Act 1986) and moved again to become s.43 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, no amendment has been made which widens the object and purpose of the provision beyond that enacted in 1986 and 1988. It may be seen that the provision, as enacted, was intended to apply to patent, technical or calculation errors which could be corrected readily on a reopening of the original sentence proceedings without troubling an appellate Court, let alone the Supreme Court on an application for prerogative relief. It was stressed in the relevant second reading speeches that the provision was not to operate as a broader form of appeal or review. 

Provisions for Appeal or Review of Sentences in New South Wales

136The context in which this provision operated, and continues to operate, includes the statutory scheme for appeals from, and review of, sentence in New South Wales. 

137A number of statutes make elaborate provision for appeals against sentence in this State. These provisions provide part of the context in which s.43 operates. The relevant statutes provide that:

(a) appeals may be brought on sentence by both the convicted person or the prosecutor from the Local Court to the District Court under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (part of the statutory scheme which replaced the Justices Act 1902);

(b) although not often utilised, an appeal may be brought from the Local Court to the Supreme Court with respect to sentence under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001;

(c) where an offender is sentenced on indictment in the Supreme Court or the District Court, the offender may seek leave to appeal against sentence under s.5(1)(c) Criminal Appeal Act 1912;

(d) where an offender is sentenced on indictment in the Supreme Court or the District Court, the Crown may appeal against sentence under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

138A well-established body of jurisprudence has developed concerning these various avenues of appeal. 

139I leave aside provisions for appeal from sentencing decisions of the Land and Environment Court and the Industrial Court of New South Wales. Those Courts do not deal with indictable offences. That said, s.43 applies to all sentencing Courts in this State, including those Courts.

140As the standard non-parole period system applies only to offences prosecuted on indictment, attention will be confined to appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal.

141The Court of Criminal Appeal is a court of error: R v Visconti (1982) 2 NSWLR 104 at 108. Error must be demonstrated on a sentence appeal brought by an offender in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]. If such error is demonstrated, before the Court may proceed to resentence the offender on appeal, the Court must form a positive opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

142If error is demonstrated on an offender's appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal may receive further evidence for the purpose of determining whether the question under s.6(3) should be answered in favour of the offender, with a lesser sentence being imposed. Under s.6(3), the Court re-exercises the sentencing discretion, taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles, with a view to formulating the positive opinion for which the subsection provides: Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 at 287 [19].

143In addition, since 1987, s.12(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 permits the Court to remit a matter to the Court of trial for determination. The power in s.12(2) has been exercised from time to time on sentence appeals to this Court, in particular where there has been a significant passage of time between the imposition of the original sentence in the District Court and the hearing of the appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal, and where substantial additional or updated evidence may be adduced at the resentencing hearing. Where the Court of Criminal Appeal has found error and has determined that intervention under s.6(3) is warranted, the Court may elect to remit the matter to the first-instance Court for a Judge of that Court to resentence the offender upon the basis of evidence adduced at that hearing: Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at 181-182 [145]-[146]; O'Neil-Shaw v R [2010] NSWCCA 42 at [32]-[34], [57]; Urriola v R [2012] NSWCCA 95 at [50]-[52].

144On a Crown appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912, it is necessary for the Crown to establish error in accordance with the principles in House v The King: Markarian v The Queen at 370-371 [25]-[28]. If error is demonstrated, the Court considers whether to exercise its discretion to resentence the offender: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7.

145On an offender's appeal or a Crown appeal, s.7(1A) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 enables the Court to vary other sentences even though those sentences were not challenged directly on appeal: Marinellis v R [2006] NSWCCA 307 at [13].

146Also forming part of the statutory landscape for review of sentencing decisions are the provisions contained in Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. This Part is the modern equivalent of s.475 Crimes Act 1900, which predated the criminal appellate system created by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. An inquiry was directed in 1983 by Street CJ under s.475 Crimes Act 1900 into certain mitigating circumstances affecting the determination of sentence: R v Kinsella (Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 November 1983, unreported); Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 45-46.

147The provisions now contained in Part 7 were amended in 1996 by the Crimes Amendment (Review of Convictions and Sentences) Act 1996, to provide expressly for a direction to be given concerning sentence only (under what is now s.79 Criminal (Appeal and Review) Act 2001): Application of Pearson [1999] NSWSC 143; 46 NSWLR 148 at 155 [23], 159 [45]; Application of El Hani [2007] NSWSC 330 at [21].

Operation of s.43

148The extrinsic material made plain that a s.43 application was not a form of appeal or review. 

149The s.43 power is being exercised by a court at the same tier in the judicial hierarchy of courts which imposed the original penalty, although the judicial officer exercising the s.43 function may, or may not, be the original decision maker on sentence.

150The examples provided by Ministers in the relevant second reading speeches illuminate the purpose of the section. A period of disqualification which was less than the statutory minimum is a clear example of this. An order of imprisonment by way of periodic detention, in circumstances where the offender did not satisfy the statutory criteria constituted a further example of the imposition of a penalty that was simply not available. A third area involved correction of errors under the Probation and Parole Act 1983, where calculation errors may have occurred which were clearly identifiable and capable of simple correction.

151Of course, no exhaustive set of illustrations can be provided for cases where, for the purposes of s.43, a court has ""imposed a penalty that is contrary to law"" or has ""failed to impose a penalty that is required to be imposed by law"". However, the examples provided give content to the construction and operation of the section.

152As observed earlier, the cases cited by the Chief Justice and Garling J include statements supporting a broad construction of s.43. It is pertinent, however, to note examples provided in two of these decisions to illustrate the operation of the section, after a general explanation of the provision had been given. These examples appear to echo examples provided by the Ministers in relevant second reading speeches.

153The Chief Justice and Garling J refer (at [32]) to R v Finnie (No. 2) [2004] NSWCCA 150. There, Howie J (Spigelman CJ and Dunford J agreeing) made observations concerning s.43, before providing the following example at [32] (emphasis added):

""It is not difficult to imagine a situation where a sentencer misunderstood or overlooked a fact in evidence before the court and as a result imposed a sentence that fell within the scope of the provision. A not uncommon example would be where the failure to take into account the existence of a particular traffic conviction resulted in the court failing to impose the disqualification period mandated by statute where such a prior conviction exists. Where a relevant error is established, the section is engaged and, at least in so far as the jurisdiction of the court to reopen the sentencing proceedings is concerned, it is unnecessary for the court to determine how the erroneous sentence came about.""

154Reference is made by the Chief Justice and Garling J, at [36]-[37], to Meakin v Director of Public Prosecutions [2011] NSWCCA 373; 216 A Crim R 128. There, Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) said at 146 [92] (emphasis added):

""A failure to be aware of such statutory provisions may result in a sentence that is manifestly inadequate or excessive. It is a different question as to whether that constitutes a sentencing error that is 'contrary to law' within s 43. In my opinion, that question can be answered fairly readily. As I have discussed, the effect of the authorities is that s 43 looks to the outcome of the proceedings. It is the sentence imposed which must be 'contrary to law'. That is, there must be an error in the sentence imposed with the consequence that some different sentence is required. Thus a sentence that is greater or less than that prescribed will be a sentence imposed that is 'contrary to law'. For example, if a sentence is imposed in respect of a high range PCA, when the offence was a mid or low-range PCA, there will be a sentence imposed that is 'contrary to law'.""

155In effect, the applicant's submission is that s.43 allows a first-instance sentencing Judge (or another Judge of the same Court) to engage afresh in the process of instinctive synthesis for a standard non-parole period offence, by reference to principles in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 in place of those in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168, once R v Way error has been identified. This process would involve identification of relevant factors (including the standard non-parole period) and an assessment of their significance, followed by the making of a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence in the exercise of instinctive or intuitive synthesis: Markarian v The Queen at 375 [39], 378 [51]; Muldrock v The Queen at 131-132 [26]-[27].

156What appears in the preceding paragraph describes the quintessential task of this Court on a sentence appeal, after error is established, on the pathway to the imposition of a substituted sentence under s.5D or s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. To the extent that the construction of s.43 permits the prospect of the use of that provision in these circumstances, that construction runs up against the powerful conclusion that s.43 is not to be used in these circumstances, on discretionary grounds, because it would be an inappropriate proxy for an appeal.

157Further, on a s.43 application, the powers contained in s.7(1A) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 would not apply to allow adjustment of sentences for offences without standard non-parole periods, for which an offender may have been sentenced at the same time as sentence for a standard non-parole period offence. Accordingly, correction of R v Way error on a s.43 application would not permit adjustment of surrounding sentences for other offences in a manner which could occur on a sentence appeal.

158The appropriate course, where R v Way error is asserted by an offender in sentencing in the Supreme or District Courts, is application for leave to appeal under s.5(1)(c) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In exercising that appellate function, if error is demonstrated, this Court may determine to resentence under s.6(3) or, in appropriate cases, use the s.12(2) remittal power to allow resentencing in the original sentencing Court.

159All of this, to my mind, supports the approach of the Chief Justice and Garling J (expressed at [66]-[67]), which sees s.43 having practical application to patent, technical or calculation errors, but with a firm discretionary hand applying to confine its use to errors of that type, to avoid a first-instance Court, on a s.43 application, usurping the proper role of appellate courts.

160The legislature may wish to revisit s.43. The narrow purpose of the provision, identified upon its introduction in the 1980s, has been affected by a broad construction applied by the Courts since then. In my view, it would be appropriate for the matter to be referred to the Attorney General for consideration of reform of s.43, in light of the issues ventilated in the judgments of the Court on this application.

Conclusions

161In the most exceptional circumstances of this case, for the reasons given by the Chief Justice and Garling J (at [68]), I agree that it is appropriate to consider whether the preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction under s.43 are made out.

162I agree with the answers to Questions 2, 3 and 4 in the judgment of the Chief Justice and Garling J.

163I agree with the orders proposed in the joint judgment.

164BELLEW J: I agree with the orders proposed in the judgment of the Chief Justice and Garling J for the reasons which they express.

2761541,Chen v R [2013] NSWCCA 116,"Judgment

1HOEBEN JA : I agree with Button J. 

2CAMPBELL J : I agree with the orders proposed by Button J and, with one exception, with his Honour's reasons. In relation to ground 3, I do not find it necessary to decide whether the changes made to s.35 Crimes Act 1900 by Crimes Amendment (Reckless Infliction of Harm) Act 2012 reverse Blackwell v. R [2011] NSWCCA 93; 81 NSWLR 119. As Button J points out, the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge brought under s.35 (3) in the form it took on 19th March 2011. In that form either ""a small cut or a gaping one"" satisfied the verb ""wounds"". (Button J at [51]). As his Honour says a consideration of gradations of seriousness is not germane to the elements of the offence. In light of this, I would read the sentencing judge's finding in respect of the applicant, who was then wielding a knife in a slashing motion toward the victim, that ""[c]learly the offender intended to cause some injury"" as meaning injury by wounding, regardless of the intended severity. As Button J's analysis demonstrates at the relevant time, and now, ""recklessness ... may ... be established by proof of intention."" (See Button J [55]).

3BUTTON J : On 23 March 2012, Siwen Chen (""the applicant"") was sentenced by his Honour Judge Frearson SC in the District Court of New South Wales for one count of reckless wounding in company. The offence was committed on 19 March 2011. The charge was brought pursuant to s 35(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (""the Act""). The offence carried with it a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years and, pursuant to the table in Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 4 years.

4His Honour imposed a non-parole period of imprisonment for 18 months with an additional term of 18 months. In other words, a head sentence of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 18 months was imposed. Special circumstances were found; if that had not been the case, the non-parole period would have been 2 years 3 months. 

Objective features

5An agreed statement of facts was tendered. I shall quote from a small portion of it later in my judgment.

6The review of the objective features of the offence in the remarks on sentence is, save for one paragraph, not impugned by the applicant. I shall quote from it, and indicate the paragraph that forms the foundation of two grounds of appeal.

""The facts are set out in a statement of facts which reveal that the offender is of Chinese nationality and currently holds a bridging visa which is in effect indefinitely. On Saturday 19 March 2011 the victim Yan Jing attended the karaoke bar the K1 with some friends. The karaoke bar is located in Factory Lane at Haymarket. Mr Jing and his friends booked a room at the karaoke from 7pm until 11pm and throughout the evening several more friends arrived until there were approximately fifteen people in the group. And over the course of the night Mr Jin[g] consumed four glasses of whisky and green tea and each glass apparently had a half of shot of whisky in it.

It was at about 11pm that Mr Jing left the karaoke room with his friends. He walked down the stairs to the front exit on street level. It was raining heavily outside and Mr Jing stood under the shelter covering the front door. He had a conversation with a Mr Qiang about who was going to collect the car from a nearby car park, and as they were talking the offender and a group of between four to five males walked past and overheard the conversation. The offender said to Mr Qiang, 'What the fuck are you talking about?' And Mr Jing and Mr Qiang ignored the offender. A second male walked up to Mr Qiang and slapped him on the right side of the face. Mr Jing stepped in between Mr Qiang and the males and said, 'What happened, stop it.' The offender kicked Mr Jing in the stomach causing him to fall down. The offender then pulled out a flick knife about fifteen centimetres long with a seven centimetre blade. He pulled that out from his pocket and he slashed the right arm of Mr Jing. Indeed there are photographs tendered before of the knife which looks a particularly sinister weapon I might say. Mr Kang stepped in front of Mr Jing and said, 'Stop, we can talk. What happened?' Mr Kang heard the offender say, 'I'm their big brother'. He also heard another male say, 'Make them apologise'. Mr Kang saw the offender waving the flick knife around. Someone called Mr Situ was standing nearby, heard the offender say in Chinese, 'I'm the gang boss' and 'fuck you'. Mr Kang heard someone yell out that Mr Jing had been cut. He turned and saw Mr Jing in the entrance to the karaoke bar bleeding heavily from his right arm. Mr Kang called to the security guards for assistance and asked them to contact the police. Mr Jing was assisted upstairs to await the arrival of paramedics and police.

The offender and his friends ran in a northerly direction along Dixon Street until they reached Goulburn Street. They then turned right onto Goulburn Street and left onto Sussex Street until they reached The Greenbox Karaoke Bar on Eager Lane. The group was followed by a security guard who was responding to a call for assistance which had been broadcast over the radio. The offender attempted to gain entry to the Greenbox Karaoke Bar but was refused.

Meanwhile officer Maxwell and another officer were inside the Greenbox Karaoke Bar when then they responded to a police radio call for assistance and when they exited the Greenbox they spoke to a person who pointed out the offender and his friends. Sergeant Maxwell saw the offender with a knife in his right hand and the blade extended. Sergeant Maxwell yelled to the offender several times to drop the knife and get to the ground. The offender wiped the blade of the knife on his pants and placed the knife in his rear right hand pants pocket. Eventually he dropped to his knees and was placed under arrest. He was escorted to the Central Police Station and charged.

Meanwhile some other officers who were patrolling the area had also heard the broadcast and they attended the bar. What was observed was a large amount of blood in the main foyer entrance. They also noted that they spoke to Mr Jing who was lying on a lounge with a bandage around his forearm and he was photographed. The two ambulance officers arrived and they commenced some treatment and the victim was escorted to St Vincent's Hospital and he received approximately fifteen sutures. The injury is described as a complicated deep laceration of the muscle of the right forearm requiring surgical exploration and debridement.""

7The following paragraph is impugned by the applicant:

""One only has to read out those facts to observe immediately that this was an ugly incident, completely unprovoked, involving a high level of violence and a high level of aggression and the victim was deliberately kicked and slashed with the knife. Clearly the offender intended to cause some injury, notwithstanding his level of intoxication; the wound was indeed substantial requiring the fifteen sutures. Fortunately there is no apparent permanent damage apart from the inevitable scarring.""

Subjective features

8A plea of guilty had been entered by the applicant in the Local Court. His Honour applied a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of that plea of guilty. Neither party calls that discount into question in this Court.

9The applicant is of Chinese nationality and, as has been recounted, at the time of the commission of the offence was on an indefinite bridging visa. He was 22 years of age, and was living with his wife. The evidence was that he had enjoyed a sound upbringing in China, and had come to Australia in 2005. 

10The applicant had no criminal antecedents at the time of the offence or at the time of sentence.

11The following matters were accepted by His Honour.

12First, the applicant was very intoxicated at the time of the offence. He had drunk a very substantial amount of alcohol at a wedding. The applicant had amnesia with regard to the offence as a result. Drinking that amount of alcohol was very much out of character for the applicant, and it led to him behaving in a way that was out of character.

13Secondly, the life and emotional well-being of the applicant had been very adversely affected by the commission of the offence and its consequences. His wife was pregnant at the time of the offence, and in light of his potential incarceration and deportation, his wife and he had decided to terminate the pregnancy. If he were to be deported to China, the asthma from which his wife suffers would make it difficult for her to live there, at least in a big city.

14Thirdly, the applicant was remorseful with regard to what he had done.

15Fourthly, the applicant was unlikely to offend again, at least ""in this particular way"".

16Fifthly, the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation.

17Sixthly and finally, the applicant had developed anxiety and depression as a result of the commission of the offence and its consequences.

Aspects of the hearing at first instance

18A number of aspects of the proceedings on sentence are important to the determination of the appeal.

19First, the applicant was represented by senior counsel most experienced in criminal defence work.

20Secondly, the following paragraph was contained in the agreed facts:

""The offender kicked Mr Jing in the stomach causing him to fall down. The offender then pulled a flick knife approximately 15 cm long with a 7cm blade from his pocket and slashed the right arm of Mr Jing: see photograph of knife.""

Grounds

21Seven grounds of appeal were originally notified. Ground two was not pressed.

""1. The learned sentencing judge fell into error in reaching a conclusion, beyond reasonable doubt, that the applicant deliberately wounded the complainant.

...

3. The learned sentencing judge fell into error re the element of 'recklessness'.

4. The learned sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to the applicant's contrition.

5. The learned sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to the exceptional person [sic] hardship upon the applicant as a result of his conviction.

6. The learned sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to the statutory matters in mitigation.

7. In view of the above, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.""

With regard to ground six, it was made clear by counsel for the applicant that the single factor upon which reliance was placed was the intoxication of the applicant. 

Ground One: ""The learned sentencing judge fell into error in reaching a conclusion, beyond reasonable doubt, that the applicant deliberately wounded the complainant.""

Background and submissions

22This ground was founded on the statement of his Honour in the impugned paragraph of the remarks on sentence that ""the victim was deliberately kicked and slashed with a knife"". It was submitted in short that the evidence before his Honour did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that the victim was deliberately slashed. It was said that the only way that that proposition could be established, in the absence of direct evidence, was from the surrounding circumstances. It was submitted that neither the kicking of the applicant shortly before the infliction of the wound, nor the appearance of the knife, nor the behaviour of the applicant after the wounding, could establish the aggravating matter found by his Honour to the criminal standard. In fact, in light of the fact that the applicant was waving the knife around immediately after the incident, it was reasonably possible that the applicant was waving the knife around at the time of the wounding, rather than deliberately slashing the victim.

23In oral submissions, counsel for the applicant submitted that the slashing was not ""not deliberate in the sense of premeditated"". A little later, he said: 

""It boils down to the fact that what I am submitting is that this was or you would look at an irrational act and then the culpability must be less and at the top end of the scale in that regard would be premeditation or a deliberate intent to bring about a particular result. I am saying here that because it was completely irrational, not provoked, there is no rationality and that must, as far as criminal liability is concerned, does not allow him to escape but when you assess the degree of culpability then this is an act that goes to the lower end of the scale although the total act is a serious act."" (emphasis added)

24The Crown submitted that that there was no evidence at first instance that there had been an ""accidental"" slashing. Nor was a submission to that effect made on behalf of the applicant at first instance. She submitted that, in considering the surrounding circumstances, the timing of the wounding was important. It was after there had been some confrontation between the two groups of men, and also immediately after the deliberate kicking of the victim by the applicant. She submitted that the finding complained of was certainly reasonably open. She also submitted that the agreed facts support the proposition that the slashing was deliberate.

25Finally, she submitted that the plea entered and maintained whilst represented by senior counsel was inconsistent with a submission now made in this Court that the slashing was not deliberate.

Determination

26The submissions in support of this ground demonstrate the need for care with regard to terminology when discussing the elements and attributes of a criminal offence.

27In order to understand my analysis of this ground and the next ground, it is necessary to set out various provisions of the Crimes Act as they stood at 19 March 2011, the date of the offence.

28It will be recalled that the charge was brought pursuant to s 35(3) of the Crimes Act. At that time, the relevant portions of s 35 were as follows:

""35 Reckless grievous bodily harm or wounding

(1) Reckless grievous bodily harm - in company

A person who, in the company of another person or persons, recklessly causes grievous bodily harm to any person is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 14 years.

(2) Reckless grievous bodily harm

A person who recklessly causes grievous bodily harm to any person is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.

(3) Reckless wounding-in company

A person who, in the company of another person or persons, recklessly wounds any person is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.

(4) Reckless wounding

A person who recklessly wounds any person is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 7 years.

...""


29Section 33 of the same Act was as follows:

""33 Wounding or grievous bodily harm with intent

(1) Intent to cause grievous bodily harm

A person who:
(a) wounds any person, or
(b) causes grievous bodily harm to any person,

with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to that or any other person is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years.

(2) Intent to resist arrest

A person who:
(a) wounds any person, or
(b) causes grievous bodily harm to any person,

with intent to resist or prevent his or her (or another person's) lawful arrest or detention is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years.


...""

30Section 5 of the Act (to which I shall return) had been repealed on 15 February 2008. Section 4A was as follows:

""4A Recklessness

For the purposes of this Act, if an element of an offence is recklessness, that element may also be established by proof of intention or knowledge.""

31An offence pursuant to s 35 did not appear in the non-exclusive list of offences of specific intent contained in s 428B of the Crimes Act.

32In short, in order to prove the offence, the prosecution needed to prove that:

(1)By way of a voluntary act;

(2)The applicant wounded another person;

(3)At the time the applicant intended to wound or was reckless as to wounding; and

(4)At the time the applicant was in company of another person or persons.

33When I refer to a voluntary act, I mean a willed contraction or expansion of the muscles: see Ryan v The Queen [1967] HCA 2; (1967) 121 CLR 205. The paradigm of an involuntary act is head butting a person whilst suffering from an epileptic fit. A person who did such an act would not, of course, be guilty of assault.

34As for recklessness with regard to the wounding, it was incumbent upon the prosecution to prove that the applicant foresaw that there was a possibility that his act could cause the type of harm in fact caused, see R v Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 467; (1990) 47 A Crim R 306. In other words, the prosecution needed to prove that, at the time of the wounding, the applicant foresaw the possibility of a wound being inflicted. As for the need to prove foresight of the possibility of wounding, and not just some actual bodily harm, see: R v Smyth [1963] VR 737 and R v Kane [1974] VR 759. Both of those decisions are cited with approval in R v Coleman at 313. 

35Those two aspects of the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty were not controversial. His plea, maintained whilst represented by senior counsel most experienced in criminal law, is a powerful indicator that he accepted that those matters had been established by the prosecution.

36As can be seen from the extracts from the submissions that I have provided, it is not clear, with respect, what meaning counsel for the applicant attached to the phrase ""deliberately slashed"" that was used in the remarks on sentence. At times it was equated with an intention to cause the damage that was done; on other occasions premeditation; and on another occasion rationality on the part of the applicant.

37I consider that, by saying that the applicant deliberately slashed the victim, his Honour was saying nothing more than that the action of moving the knife in such a way that it inflicted a substantial wound to the victim was a voluntary one. As I have indicated, that proposition was accepted by way of the plea of guilty.

38If his Honour was also saying that the applicant slashed the victim intending to inflict a cut or wound upon him, in light of the surrounding circumstances, and the length and seriousness of the wound, I consider that that finding was certainly reasonably open. And as I have demonstrated, pursuant to s 4A of the Act, intention was a mode of proving recklessness. 

39Finally, such a finding by his Honour would not have infringed the principle in R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383. That is because such a finding would not leave the applicant open to punishment for a more serious offence that carried a higher maximum penalty and structurally sat above the offence in s 35(3). It can be seen that none of the offences contained in s 33 as at 19 March 2011 could be made out by an intention to wound. 

40I consider that ground one should not succeed.

Ground Three: ""The learned sentencing judge fell into error re the element of 'recklessness'""

Background and submissions

41This ground is founded on the statement by His Honour in the remarks on sentence that ""[c]learly the offender intended to cause some injury"". It was submitted that that statement was not ""in accordance with the definition of 'recklessness'"" as explained in Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93; (2011) 81 NSWLR 119. Particular reliance was placed upon [82] of the judgment of Beazley JA (as her Honour then was). There it was said:

""This submission may have had some force if the suggested direction as to recklessness for the purposes of s 35(2) as amended was correct. However, I do not think that it is. The Crown's submission fails to disengage with the statutory jurisprudence prior to the amending legislation. Both the word 'maliciously' and its defined concepts have disappeared from the statute. Relevantly for present purposes, the statute provides for a offence of ""recklessly [causing] grievous bodily harm"". There is no definitional construct within the terms of the provision which governs its meaning. There is a requirement of recklessness, which I have addressed. That is, there must be a foresight of the possibility of something. The recklessness must cause something. That which it must cause is grievous bodily harm. In my opinion, there is no basis upon which that term can be read down to mean ""some physical injury"". Although the purpose of the amending legislation was to remove the 'archaic' fault element of offences done maliciously, there is a difference of substance between an intention to inflict some physical harm (the former s 35) and recklessness as to whether grievous bodily harm would be inflicted (s 35(2) as amended) as I have explained.""

I shall return in a moment to place this extract upon which counsel for the applicant relied in context.

42It was submitted that, although Blackwell v R was to do with an offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, brought pursuant to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act, nevertheless the principle enunciated by her Honour was applicable to an offence brought pursuant to s 35(3). It was submitted that, if the submission of the applicant with regard to Blackwell v R is accepted, ""an objective view of the applicant's culpability, indicates a less serious offence, than that indicated by the learned sentencing judge"".

43In response, counsel for the Crown submitted that, in truth, the principle in Blackwell v R has no application to this case. That is because the discussion in Blackwell v R was founded upon the common law with regard to the mental element of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, not malicious wounding, and the judgment of Beazley JA was about whether an amendment to that particular offence had caused an alteration to its elements.

44It was also submitted that, if in truth the complaint of counsel for the applicant is that his Honour made a finding that was not reasonably open, and that finding aggravated the circumstances of the offence, considering all of the evidence, not least the weapon used, the finding that ""[c]learly the offender intended to cause some injury"" was certainly reasonably open.

Determination

45I consider that the reliance in this case upon the principle in Blackwell v R is, with respect, misconceived. In order to explain why, I need to provide a chronology of the complicated development of the offences contained in ss 33 and 35 of the Act.

Chronology of the development of the sections and the case law

46For many years the offences in ss 33 and 35 were unchanged. As at May 1988, (the relevance of which date I shall explain in a moment) the sections creating the offences were as follows:

""33 Wounding etc with intent to do bodily harm or resist arrest

Whosoever:

maliciously by any means wounds or inflicts grievous bodily harm upon any person, or

maliciously shoots at, or in any manner attempts to discharge any kind of loaded arms at any person,

with intent in any such case to do grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist, or prevent, the lawful apprehension or detainer either of himself or any other person,
shall be liable to penal servitude for life.

...

35 Malicious wounding or infliction of grievous bodily harm

Whosoever maliciously by any means:

(a) wounds any person, or
(b) inflicts grievous bodily harm upon any person,

shall be liable to penal servitude for 7 years.""

47At the same time, an offence of maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse was contained in s 61C. It was relevantly as follows:

""61C Sexual assault category 2 - inflicting actual bodily harm etc with intent to have sexual intercourse

(1) Any person who: 

(a) maliciously inflicts actual bodily harm upon another person, or

(b) threatens to inflict actual bodily harm upon another person by means of an offensive weapon or instrument,
with intent to have sexual intercourse with the other person shall be liable to penal servitude for 12 years.

...""

48As at the same date, s 5 of the Act was in the following terms:

""5 Maliciously

Maliciously: Every act done of malice, whether against an individual or any corporate body or number of individuals, or done without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering, or with intent to injure some person or persons, or corporate body, in property or otherwise, and in any such case without lawful cause or excuse, or done recklessly or wantonly, shall be taken to have been done maliciously, within the meaning of this Act, and of every indictment and charge where malice is by law an ingredient in the crime.""

49In R v Coleman, Hunt J (as his Honour then was) discussed the offence of maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. The date of the commission of the offence under consideration in that appeal was 19 May 1988. In his Honour's judgment (with which Finlay and Allen JJ agreed) his Honour said at 312 - 313 with regard to malice and its proof by recklessness:

""At the time of that decision [i.e. the decision of the High Court of Australia in R v Crabbe [1985] HCA 22; (1985) 156 CLR 464], it was also generally accepted law in Australia that, in statutory offences other than murder, the degree of recklessness required in order to establish that an act was done maliciously was a realisation on the part of the accused that the particular kind of harm in fact done (that is, some physical harm - but not necessarily the degree of harm in fact so done) might be inflicted (that is, may possibly be inflicted) yet he went ahead and acted. That general acceptance in Australia appears to have flowed from the decision of the English Court of Criminal Appeal in Cunningham, as explained by that Court in Mowatt [1968] 1 QB 421 at 426; (1967) 51 Cr App R 402 at 406-407."" (original emphasis)

50For many years that was understood to be the definitive statement as to the degree of harm required to be foreseen as possible by an offender in the context of recklessness other than with regard to the offence of murder. It was accepted that the judgment of Hunt J, when applied to the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, was to the effect that, to be guilty of such an offence, an offender need not have foreseen the possibility of grievous bodily harm resulting from his or her actions. All that was required to have been foreseen was the possibility of actual bodily harm. 

51It is noteworthy that the decision in R v Coleman said nothing about the mental element of the particular offence of malicious wounding. No doubt that is because the concept of a wound is not open to the kind of gradation to which bodily harm is subject. By that I mean that a wound is either caused or it is not for the physical element to be made out. It matters not whether it is a small cut or a gaping one. And as I have indicated with regard to ground one, Hunt J referred with approval to two Victorian decisions to the effect that what needed to be foreseen as possible was a wound, albeit not one of the seriousness of that actually inflicted. 

52Returning to the chronological background, on 14 December 2001, by way of the Crimes Amendment (Gang and Vehicle Related Offences) Act 2001, the circumstances of aggravation of being in company was added to s 35. I record that for completeness; nothing turns on it.

53By way of Schedule 1[7] of the Crimes Amendment Act 2007, s 35 was amended. The amendments commenced on 27 September 2007. In short, the concept of malice was replaced by the concept of recklessness. A differentiation in maximum penalty founded upon the injury inflicted was also introduced: imprisonment for 10 years for grievous bodily harm and 7 years for wounding. The opportunity was also taken to insert an alternative verdict, which I shall not extract. Thereafter, the section appeared as follows:

""35 Reckless grievous bodily harm or wounding

(1) Reckless grievous bodily harm - in company
A person who, in the company of another person or persons, recklessly causes grievous bodily harm to any person is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 14 years.

(2) Reckless grievous bodily harm
A person who recklessly causes grievous bodily harm to any person is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.

(3) Reckless wounding-in company
A person who, in the company of another person or persons, recklessly wounds any person is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.

(4) Reckless wounding
A person who recklessly wounds any person is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 7 years.

...""

54On 13 October 2007, the glassing that led to the appeal in Blackwell v R was alleged to have occurred. It is noteworthy that at that stage, s 35 had been restructured but s 33 had not. In other words, the offence in s 33 remained founded on proof of malice but the offence in s 35 was now founded on proof of recklessness. 

55On 15 November 2007, by way of the Criminal Legislation Amendment Act 2007 s 4A was inserted in the Act. It was and remains as follows:

""4A Recklessness

For the purposes of this Act, if an element of an offence is recklessness, that element may also be established by proof of intention or knowledge.""


56On 15 February 2008, the amendments contained in Schedule 1[2] of the Crimes Amendment Act 2007 commenced. They repealed the definition of ""maliciously"" contained in s 5 of the Act.

57On the same date and by way of Schedule 1[4] of the same amending Act, the offences contained in s 33 were restructured. A regime of alternative verdicts was also inserted that, again, it is not necessary to recount. In short, the concept of malice was deleted with regard to s 33. The physical elements of wounding or grievous bodily harm were not altered. Thereafter s 33 was as follows:

""33 Wounding or grievous bodily harm with intent

(1) Intent to cause grievous bodily harm

A person who:

(a) wounds any person, or
(b) causes grievous bodily harm to any person,

with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to that or any other person is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years.

(2) Intent to resist arrest

A person who:

(a) wounds any person, or
(b) causes grievous bodily harm to any person,

with intent to resist or prevent his or her (or another person's) lawful arrest or detention is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years.

...""

58On 15 April 2011, the decision in Blackwell v R was delivered. To state the principle underpinning of the judgment of her Honour (with which James and Hall JJ agreed with regard to this point) with great succinctness, it was held that the change in terminology from ""maliciously"" to ""recklessly"" had worked a substantial change to the mental element of the offence in s 35. In particular, it was held that the principle in R v Coleman was no longer applicable. It was held that in order to be guilty of an offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm, as formulated on 13 October 2007, an offender must have foreseen the possibility of the infliction of grievous bodily harm, not merely actual bodily harm.

59Subsequent to the judgment in Blackwell v R, on 21 June 2012 by way of the Crimes Amendment (Reckless Infliction of Harm) Act 2012 s 35 was amended again. Again, disregarding the provision with regard to alternative verdicts, it is now as follows:

""35 Reckless grievous bodily harm or wounding

(1) Reckless grievous bodily harm - in company

A person who, in the company of another person or persons:

(a) causes grievous bodily harm to any person, and
(b) is reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to that or any other person,

is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 14 years.

(2) Reckless grievous bodily harm

A person who:

(a) causes grievous bodily harm to any person, and
(b) is reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to that or any other person,

is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.

(3) Reckless wounding - in company

A person who, in the company of another person or persons:

(a) wounds any person, and
(b) is reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to that or any other person,

is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.

(4) Reckless wounding

A person who:

(a) wounds any person, and
(b) is reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to that or any other person,

is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 7 years.

...""

60In short, although there is no judgment of this Court that has dealt with the new section, I consider that the effect of the latest amendment to s 35 is that the judgment of Beazley JA in Blackwell v R has been reversed.

61Finally, to complete a complicated legislative history, s 18 of the Act retains malice as an aspect of the offence of murder. It is as follows:

""18 Murder and manslaughter defined

(1) 
(a) Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person, or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years.

(b) Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be manslaughter.

(2) 
(a) No act or omission which was not malicious, or for which the accused had lawful cause or excuse, shall be within this section.

(b) No punishment or forfeiture shall be incurred by any person who kills another by misfortune only."" (emphasis added)

62Parenthetically, it is remarkable that the concept of malice remains in the section of the Act that defines murder and manslaughter, even though the statutory definition of that concept was deleted over five years ago. I know of no decision of this Court as to what s 18(2)(a) should now be taken to mean. 

Resolution

63The decision in Blackwell v R was with regard to the offence in s 35 of maliciously or recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm, not the offence of maliciously or recklessly wounding. That distinction is important because, as I have shown, for over 20 years there had been a decision of this Court to the effect that the mental element of offences of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm did not require proof of foresight of the possibility of the infliction of grievous bodily harm. R v Coleman was authority for the proposition that the lesser state of mind of foresight of the possibility of actual bodily harm was sufficient for inculpation. 

64But there had never been a decision to suggest that there was some ""lesser"" state of mind with regard to malicious wounding. It was always the case that, in order to be guilty of that offence, the prosecution needed to prove that the offender had inflicted a wound and, at that time, he or she foresaw the possibility of a wound occurring, albeit one not necessarily as serious as that actually inflicted. 

65I consider that it can be seen that the change in understanding of the mental element of the offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm wrought by the judgment of her Honour in Blackwell v R had no effect on the mental element of the offence of malicious wounding or the mental element of the offence of reckless wounding. That is because, as I have said, there was never understood to have been a ""lesser"" mental element for malicious wounding. And that was because the physical element of the offence was, unlike grievous bodily harm, not founded on a gradation of seriousness: either a wound had been inflicted or it had not. 

66It is true that the new ss 35(3) and 35(4) posit the broader state of mind of recklessness as to actual bodily harm. The result is that the offence of maliciously or recklessly wounding no longer requires foresight of the possibility of wounding. All it requires is foresight of the possibility of actual bodily harm (which may or may not be a wound). That may argue in support of the submission of the applicant. 

67But that alteration does not, in truth, demonstrate that Blackwell v R had anything to say about the elements of reckless wounding. Parliament had determined to reverse the decision in Blackwell v R by amending ss 35(1) and 35(2). It would have been structurally anomalous not to amend identically ss 35(3) and 35(4). That amendment does not cause me to resile from my view that neither R v Coleman nor Blackwell v R spoke directly to the elements of offences of malicious or reckless wounding in the way contended for by counsel for the applicant.

68In short, I do not consider that the principle in Blackwell v R relied upon by counsel for the applicant has application to the offence under consideration in this appeal.

69Separately, if the complaint in truth of counsel for the applicant is that the statement of his Honour infringes the rule in R v De Simoni, I respectfully disagree with that proposition. As I determined with regard to ground one, there was as at the date of the offence no greater offence of ""recklessly wounding in company with intent to cause some injury"". As can be seen from my review of the permutations of the statute, the greater offence that existed as at the date of this offence was contained in s 33, and required proof of intention to cause grievous bodily harm or to resist or prevent lawful arrest or detention. 

70Finally, if the complaint in truth is that the finding of fact that the offender had intended to cause some injury was not reasonably open, I consider that the circumstances of the offence, not least the fact that a 15 centimetre wound of some depth was inflicted upon a prone victim by a person armed with a flick knife, powerfully gainsay that proposition.

71It follows that I would not uphold ground three on any basis.

Grounds Four - Six: 

""4. The learned sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to the applicant's contrition.

5. The learned sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to the exceptional person [sic] hardship upon the applicant as a result of his conviction.

6. The learned sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to the statutory matters in mitigation.""

72Although these grounds were notified separately, at the hearing of the appeal counsel for the applicant accepted that in truth these factors should be taken into account with regard to ground seven. The adoption of that position was in accordance with the decision of this Court in Hanania v R [2012] NSWCCA 220, an approach that has recently been endorsed by the Australian Capital Territory Court of Appeal in Tate v R [2012] ACTCA 50 at [51].

73I shall therefore consider those three factors when I turn to ground seven. In light of the approach of counsel for the applicant, I would not uphold ground four, ground five or ground six as a separate ground. 

Ground Seven: ""In view of the above, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.""

Background and submissions

74In support of this ground, counsel for the applicant did not take the Court to other decisions of the Court in similar matters, or statistics, or sentencing tables, or any other material that may serve to provide some context for such a submission.

75He submitted in short that a short reduction of 6 or even 3 months to the non-parole period would be an appropriate order for this Court to make.

76Counsel for the Crown submitted that the offence was serious, unprovoked, involved the use of a knife, very violent, and resulted in a serious injury. She submitted that the head sentence of imprisonment for 3 years and the non-parole period of 18 months fell comfortably within the discretion available to his Honour.

Determination

77It is true that the applicant had pleaded guilty at an early stage; that his Honour found that the applicant was remorseful; and that the commission of the offence had had substantial psychological effects on the applicant.

78It is also true that his Honour found that the applicant was very intoxicated at the time of the offence; that the applicant was not used to being so intoxicated; and that that state of affairs led to the applicant doing something quite out of character.

79It is also true that the applicant and his wife had suffered substantial personal hardship as a result of the consequences of his acts. Having said that, I do not accept that that hardship should be characterised as exceptional. Furthermore, I would have thought that there are towns and villages in China that are away from the great metropolises and that are free from air pollution that would exacerbate chronic asthma.

80All of the factors relied upon by counsel for the applicant were explicitly and, in some cases fulsomely, addressed in the remarks on sentence.

81To be weighed against the powerful subjective case was the fact that the applicant inflicted a serious injury upon the victim by way of a flick knife in circumstances in which the applicant was unprovoked. As I have shown, his Honour characterised it as ""an ugly incident, completely unprovoked, involving a high level of violence and a high level of aggression"". I respectfully agree with his Honour.

82In light of the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period to which I have referred, I do not consider that the head sentence imposed can be characterised as manifestly excessive. I have come to the same view about the non-parole period, especially bearing in mind that it was substantially reduced by way of a finding of special circumstances. 

83In short, taking into account the complaints that underpin grounds four to six, and considering all of the objective and subjective features of the matter, I am not persuaded that ground seven has been made out. 

Orders

84I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

		22 May 2013",2013-05-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761542,R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: On 6 November 2012 the respondent (against whom outstanding charges remain unresolved) was to be tried on an indictment containing five counts of indecently assaulting a child under the age of 10 years and one count of aggravated sexual assault. Following the arraignment of the respondent, a voir dire was held in relation to the tender of the records of two telephone conversations between the complainant and the respondent. The trial judge, Quirk DCJ, rejected the evidence pursuant to powers conferred by ss 90 and 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against those rulings on evidence pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), which permits the Director to appeal as of right ""against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case"". As will appear, the correctness of the ruling made by the trial judge and the materiality of the evidence in the prosecution case are closely related. Accordingly, it is not desirable to dispose of the jurisdictional issue in isolation from the substantive argument.

2The respondent's written submissions invited the Court to depart from its judgment in R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228, particularly the principle that in applying s 137 of the Evidence Act the courts assess the capacity of the evidence to support a particular finding, but not its credibility and reliability, those being matters to be left to the jury if the evidence be admitted. The need to reconsider the reasoning in Shamouil is confirmed by the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal not to follow Shamouil in Dupas v The Queen [2012] VSCA 328 (""Dupas (2012)"") and MA v The Queen [2013] VSCA 20.

3The appeal should be allowed for the following reasons:

(1) the relevance of the evidence depended upon an inference being drawn from the telephone conversations that the accused was acknowledging sexual misconduct with the complainant; 

(2) the assertion that if the evidence were admitted the accused would in a practical sense be forced to give evidence to rebut the inference, supports the conclusion that the inference was available;

(3) the inference being available, it was a matter for the jury to decide whether it should be drawn;

(4) any perceived pressure on the accused to give evidence would flow primarily from the need to contradict the complainant's testimony, not any need to explain the phone call; in those circumstances it would not be unfair to the accused to permit the evidence to be adduced, so that the discretion in s 90 was not engaged;

(5) if the jury drew the inference, the probative value of the evidence would be significant and the prosecution case would be significantly strengthened;

(6) the potential for prejudice would lie in a failure to give proper weight to the absence of any clear allegation in the first call, and the possibility of misunderstanding the accused's response;

(7) the risk of prejudice could readily be addressed by directions to the jury which would reduce the risk of impermissible reasoning to an insignificant level; the probative value of the evidence being potentially significant, the exclusionary power in s 137 was not engaged, and

(8) because the evidence, if admitted, had the capacity to substantially strengthen the prosecution case, the Court had jurisdiction to intervene pursuant to s 5F(3A).

Factual circumstances
4The indictment alleged six incidents on five separate occasions, between 1 February and 31 October 2002 at Doonside. The complainant was then eight years of age and in primary school. The complainant's mother had separated from her father, who was then living in Queensland. The complainant's mother formed a relationship with another man who, at the relevant time, lived in the house with the complainant, her mother and the complainant's two siblings. The respondent was a close friend of the mother's de facto partner and spent much time at the home of the complainant whilst she lived there, for a period of some nine months in 2002.

5There are four main elements in the prosecution case. The primary evidence is to be found in a statement obtained by the police from the complainant. Secondly, evidence to be called from the complainant's mother identifies various contextual elements, including the presence of the respondent at the complainant's home on a number of occasions and an occasion on which the respondent took the complainant out in his car, being evidence supportive of aspects of the complaints.

6Thirdly, the complainant stated that she remembered noticing ""a mole or a sore on top of his penis toward the tip of it"" on an occasion when she says that the respondent took his penis out of his pants and made her rub it. There are photographs obtained by the police which appear to show a small red lesion on the head of the accused's penis. However, an expert medical report provides little assistance as to whether the mark is one which might have been present 10 years earlier.

7The fourth aspect of the prosecution case is the transcript of two telephone conversations between the complainant and the respondent, taped in August 2011, approximately nine years after the alleged incidents. The Court has the benefit of both a transcript of the conversation and a recording. It is not possible to describe the full flavour of the exchange, but the significant features may be noted.

8The first conversation commenced with the complainant seeking to establish to the respondent (with whom she had not had contact for 10 years) who she was. There is an available inference that he did remember her. There was then the following exchange:

""COMPLAINANT: Yeah do you remember what you used to do to me?

RESPONDENT: Yeah fuckin' oath and I wouldn't mind doing it again ... ha ha.""

9The complainant then complained that it had ruined her life, to which the respondent appeared to express disbelief. She said that she got ""kicked out"" of home and that she was ""going to the cops about it"". The conversation continued:

""RESPONDENT: When did this happen anyway?

COMPLAINANT: When I was eight years old you just admitted it.

RESPONDENT: Eight years old ...

COMPLAINANT: Remember you used to tell me I was bad and I was the bad one but now I'm older now I know that you're the bad one.

RESPONDENT: When you were in high school man not eight years old.

COMPLAINANT: I was eight years old.

RESPONDENT: I remember you from high school, remember when you were wearing the maroon jackets and that and went to high school ....""

10The call then disconnected, but the complainant rang back. The second call involved a longer response from the respondent suggesting that he remembered her and her family and asserting that he was a good friend. However, when the complainant put express complaints (""You used to touch me next to the trampoline at the back"") he denied any memory of the events.

Reasons of trial judge
11The first basis of objection raised by the defence invoked s 85 of the Evidence Act, which, so far as relevant, is in the following terms:

85 Criminal proceedings: reliability of admissions by defendants

(1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and only to evidence of an admission made by a defendant:

(a) to, or in the presence of, an investigating official who at that time was performing functions in connection with the investigation of the commission, or possible commission, of an offence, or
(b) as a result of an act of another person who was, and who the defendant knew or reasonably believed to be, capable of influencing the decision whether a prosecution of the defendant should be brought or should be continued.

(2) Evidence of the admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected.

12The trial judge rejected the application of that provision on the basis that the respondent did not know that police were facilitating and recording the conversation. That conclusion is not in issue on the appeal, but the language of s 85 was reflected in later statements in reasons.

13The accused next relied on both s 90 and s 137 of the Evidence Act as alternative bases for excluding the evidence. Those sections are in the following terms:

90 Discretion to exclude admissions

In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if:

(a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and
(b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.

137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.


14The reasons of the trial judge commenced with an extract from the joint reasons of McColl JA and Latham J in Pavitt v R [2007] NSWCCA 88; 169 A Crim R 452 at [70]. The Court in Pavitt was dealing with an appeal against conviction, one ground of which was that a tape recording of a telephone conversation between the complainant and the accused should have been rejected, pursuant to either s 90 or s 138 of the Evidence Act. (Section 138 deals with the exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence and was not relied upon in the present case.) The discussion in Pavitt explored the case law dealing with different circumstances in which admissions had been improperly obtained or extracted under conditions which would render it unjust or unfair for the evidence to be adduced. Some of the cases were decided under the Evidence Act, but others applied the general law, including two decisions of the Canadian Supreme Court. The principles extracted from the latter cases discussed whether ""the informer who caused the accused to make the statement ... was acting as an agent of the state"": at [47]. 

15That language seems to reflect concepts underlying s 85. The trial judge held that the complainant was an ""agent of the state"", as described in Pavitt, and by the Queensland Court of Appeal in R v Cavalli [2010] QCA 343. That conclusion may be doubted: the joint judgment in Pavitt stated at [71]:

""We would add that views may differ about whether a complainant is a state agent, even if the conversation is recorded in circumstances facilitated by the police .... For our part we would not readily apply the label of state agent to a complainant speaking to a suspect who had not been charged, nor refused to speak to police.""

16Both Pavitt and Cavalli relied on the decision of the High Court in The Queen v Swaffield [1998] HCA 1; 192 CLR 159 which involved two appeals, one from Queensland and one from Victoria, each involving general law principles and not the uniform evidence laws.

17In any event, the trial judge accepted that whether or not the complainant was an ""agent of the State"" was not determinative and continued (p 7), ""If I am wrong, questions of unfairness to the accused are still relevant"". Given that the focus of consideration at that stage was s 90, the only relevant consideration was unfairness. In addressing the application of s 90, the trial judge relied upon the following propositions.

(1) After identifying the admission, she found that ""the circumstances of the conversation may have adversely affected the truth of that response and, therefore, make the admission of the evidence unfair"": p 7.

(2) ""Although the Crown submits that the accused was 'fully aware' to whom he was speaking at the time he made the 'admission' sought to be relied upon, I am not satisfied that he was so aware in the first conversation in which the alleged admission was made"": p 8.

(3) There was background noise to the telephone call suggesting ""distractions"" and ""a confused situation ... as evidenced by the early responses of the accused, and the very vague proposition notionally adopted by the accused"": p 9.

(4) The voice of the complainant would have changed over the nine years since they last communicated and ""would not have been recognisable to the accused"" and ""the accused did not recognise her name or her voice"": p 10.

(5) After noting that the complainant had made no reference to specific conduct, nor to her age at the time, the trial judge held that ""the truth of the alleged admission may have been adversely affected by the manner in which it was obtained, that is, a proposition which is vague, put in circumstances where assumed knowledge by the accused cannot be safely assumed and, therefore, it would be unfair if it were admitted"": p 10.

(6) The reference by the respondent to somebody with whom he had had an association ""and impliedly a sexual one"" at the time she was a high school student suggests he may have had someone else in mind and hence ""the reliability of the alleged admission was adversely affected"": pp 10-11.

18The language of (1) appeared to reflect s 85(2). At least (2), (3), (4) and (6) involve factual findings. The prosecution challenged the correctness of various factual findings. For example, in respect of (3), the prosecutor noted that the background noise and the possible distractions affected the second conversation, but not the first. In respect of (6), the prosecutor submitted that the comment was speculation not supported by evidence. However, the significant point in respect of each of these steps in the reasoning is that the trial judge assessed the shortcomings of the evidence as support for the inference for which the prosecution contended, rather than assessing its capacity to constitute an implied admission. 

19The third passage in the reasons turned to s 137 of the Evidence Act. The trial judge identified the respondent's submissions in respect of s 137 as based on the proposition that he would be ""forced to give evidence at the trial to explain his version of what was being said in these conversations"" and would thereby be ""compelled to abandon his right to silence"": p 11. That was said to constitute ""unfair prejudice"": p 12. She also accepted that ""the jury could interpret the phone call, particularly the first phone call, as an admission by the accused that he could have had some sexual activity with a high school student, and reason from that, that if he had done so to a high school student, he would have been capable of committing these alleged offences on the complainant when she was eight years old"": p 12. Each of these factors was said to reveal a danger of unfair prejudice. There was no consideration of the extent to which appropriate directions could remove or mitigate these risks.

20On the other side of the balance, the judge held that ""the circumstances which led to the alleged admission are such that the probative value of the admission is substantially reduced"". The trial judge was satisfied that the probative value of the telephone conversations was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

Relevant legal principles
21It is clear from reading the reasons of the trial judge as a whole that her assessment of the strength of the evidence went well beyond any question of its capability to constitute an admission and hence to support the prosecution case. The judge did not purport to speculate as to how a jury with all the evidence before them would assess the available inference, but made findings, for example as to whether the accused (who gave no evidence on the voir dire) recognized the complainant's voice. Other factors were expressed in terms of possibilities (""the truth of the admission... may have been adversely affected...""). Although there was some confusion at particular points as to whether the judge was addressing s 90 or s 137, that was no doubt due to an overlap between the concepts in each section.

22The challenge to the reasoning of the trial judge gave rise to three questions, namely:

(1) Was the approach adopted, which involved an assessment of the weight of the evidence, available to the trial judge?
(2) If so, 
(a) by what standard should the findings of the trial judge be assessed on appeal, and
(b) according to the appropriate standard, were the findings erroneous?
(3) If not, can this Court intervene?

(a) resolving a conflict in authorities
23Section 137 of the Evidence Act encapsulates a principle well established under the general law, but changes its form from a discretionary power to exclude admissible evidence to a duty to exclude evidence falling within the specified evaluative assessment. The general law principle constituted, in effect, a safety valve to prevent a criminal trial miscarrying where evidence which is otherwise relevant and admissible carries a risk that the jury will ""use the evidence or be affected by it in a way that the law does not permit"": Pfennig v The Queen [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461 at 528 (McHugh J). Many exclusionary rules of evidence have a similar purpose, namely to protect the jury from evidence which might be relevant, but which the law considers may be misused. Rules requiring warnings have a similar function. 

24The exercise involved in weighing the value of the evidence if properly used against the risk of misuse has been described as requiring a comparison of ""incommensurable considerations"": Shamouil at [71] (Spigelman CJ); Pfennig at 528 (McHugh J). With higher levels of education than was common in earlier times, there has been a growing willingness to leave a wider range of evidence to the jury. A similar approach could lead to the view that the occasions calling for the exercise of the exclusionary power pursuant to s 137 should also reduce. On the other hand, there may be a countervailing tendency in operation, namely to use the exclusionary power more commonly in circumstances where more potentially prejudicial evidence has become admissible.

25This Court has approached s 137 by focusing on the capacity of the evidence to support the prosecution case, rather than assessing the actual weight which the trial judge or a jury, acting reasonably, might attribute to such evidence. This approach emphasises the constitutional role of the jury as the body responsible for assessing the credibility and reliability of witnesses, for drawing appropriate inferences and for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence. This approach, which may be described as a ""restrictive"" or ""narrow"" approach by reference to the role of the judge, was authoritatively formulated in Shamouil.

26An approach which would allow the trial judge to assess probative value was upheld by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Dupas (2012). The Court was satisfied that the approach adopted in Shamouil was ""manifestly wrong and should not be followed"": at [63]. Because the approach of the trial judge reflected that upheld in Dupas (2012), there is a live question as to whether this Court should (in the sense of being obliged to) follow Dupas (2012) or whether it should follow its own earlier decision in Shamouil. The Director took the position that Shamouil was to be followed unless shown to be clearly wrong, which he submitted was not the position adopted by the respondent. 

27It is true that senior counsel for the respondent vacillated as to the course he wished to take. Rather obliquely, the respondent's written submissions noted that ""the correctness of [Shamouil] is now very much an open question, after the judgment of an unanimous five-judge Victorian Court of Appeal holding in Dupas ... that 'Shamouil and the other decisions that have applied it are manifestly wrong and should not be followed'"": at par 27. However, his primary position was that he did not need to challenge the correctness of Shamouil because that case stood for the limited principle that it was not for the court to assess the credibility of the witness or the ""reliability"" of the proffered evidence when determining probative value. The respondent argued that his case raised no issue as to credibility or reliability; rather, ""the issue is the strength of the inference which the Crown seeks to draw from what was said"": at par 26. In order to uphold the power of the trial judge to assess the strength of the inference relied upon by the prosecution, he accepted the need to challenge the approach adopted in R v Suman Sood [2007] NSWCCA 214 which held that it was ""no part of the trial judge's function in assessing probative value under s 137 to have regard to competing explanations for the respondent's conduct, other than that upon which the Crown relied"": at [40] (Latham J; Ipp JA and Fullerton J agreeing). His alternative position was that, if Sood found its justification in Shamouil, then he challenged the approach accepted in Shamouil. He obtained some support for the proposition that Sood went beyond accepted authority, by reference to statements in the judgments of this Court in DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 259 FLR 262 at [78]-[82] (Whealy JA); see also at [10] (Bathurst CJ), [11] (Allsop P), [135] (McClellan CJ at CL) and [136] (McCallum J).

28When, in the course of oral argument, it was suggested that this Court may be obliged to follow Dupas (2012) senior counsel for the respondent submitted that Dupas (2012) was correct and that Shamouil was clearly wrong. However, neither he nor counsel for the Director was willing to address the question whether this Court was required to follow Dupas (2012). Whatever the respondent's position, that adopted by the Director was unacceptable. If he contended (as he did) that this Court should follow its own earlier decision in Shamouil, he was obliged to confront the status of the Victorian Court of Appeal decision.

29Apart from the lack of proper submissions in respect of the issue, there is another difficulty in determining the proper course to be taken in this Court in the light of the conflicting decisions.

30The difficulty involves two limbs. First, conventional statements of the doctrine of precedent under the common law require that courts in a hierarchical system are bound to follow decisions on points of law by courts at a higher tier of the hierarchy: Broome v Cassell & Co [1972] AC 1027 at 1054 (Lord Hailsham); Fleming v White [1981] 2 NSWLR 719 at 725-726 (Street CJ; Hope JA and Nagle CJ at CL agreeing); Proctor v Jetway Aviation Pty Ltd [1984] 1 NSWLR 166 at 177 (Moffitt P) and 185 (Priestley JA) (Glass JA agreeing with both). They also follow their own decisions, unless found to be clearly wrong or, in the preferable terminology adopted by Nettle JA in RJE v Secretary to the Department of Justice [2008] VSCA 265; 21 VR 526 at [104], for a ""compelling reason"": Gett v Tabet [2009] NSWCA 76; 254 ALR 504 at [273], [277], [281]-[284] and [301].

31The Victorian Court of Appeal, however, at least when exercising State jurisdiction, does not stand within the same hierarchy as this Court, although both courts have a common final court of appeal above them, namely the High Court. (On one view, this could give rise to analogous issues for the doctrine of precedent as arose for courts in different jurisdictions having a common final court of appeal in the Privy Council.) A critical factor for Australian intermediate courts of appeal is that each State court forms part of the ""integrated judicial system for which Chapter III provides"": Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24; 189 CLR 51 at 102-103 (Gaudron J); see also 112 and 114-115 (McHugh J), 138 and 143 (Gummow J). Once it is accepted that the State courts occupy a ""constitutionally mandated position in the Australian legal system"" - see Condon v Pompano Pty Ltd [2013] HCA 7; 295 ALR 638 at [123] - it is at least plausible that the relationship of the State Supreme Courts, inter se, will derive some characteristics from the constitutional context: Gett v Tabet at [279]-[280]. What those characteristics may be cannot be properly explored in this case because no party addressed the issue and no party gave notice to the Attorneys pursuant to s 78 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).

32Nevertheless, the significance of the point must be noted. In Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd [1993] HCA 15; 177 CLR 485, a case involving the proper construction of the Corporations Law, then uniform State law, the High Court stated at 492:

""Although the considerations applying are somewhat different from those applying in the case of Commonwealth legislation, uniformity of decision in the interpretation of uniform national legislation such as the Law is a sufficiently important consideration to require that an intermediate appellate court - and all the more so a single judge - should not depart from an interpretation placed on such legislation by another Australian intermediate appellate court unless convinced that that interpretation is plainly wrong.""

33The ""same principle"" was said to apply in relation to ""non-statutory law"": Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; 230 CLR 89 at [135]. Without knowing the legal basis for such a principle, it is not possible to say whether the principle applies to uniform legislation which is not ""national"" in its operation. The Victorian Court of Appeal in Dupas (2012) appears to have assumed that the principle does apply and that it was required to follow Shamouil unless satisfied that it was ""plainly wrong"". Furthermore, without knowing the legal basis for the principle thus expressed, it is not entirely clear what approach this Court should take to a finding of another intermediate Court of Appeal that its earlier decision was ""plainly wrong"".

34In earlier times, the willingness of intermediate courts of appeal to defer to each other's statements on issues of principle was based on the practice of comity. It is better described as a practice, rather than a principle, because comity denotes courtesy or civility. It reflects more than that, however: the effective administration of impartial and independent justice depends upon the maintenance of public respect for the courts as an institution. Whilst the hierarchical structure of courts is posited upon the need for an appellate system to correct error in courts lower in the hierarchy, the categorisation of a decision of another court at the same level of the hierarchy as plainly or clearly wrong on a point of law is the antithesis of treating courts of equal status with courtesy and civility. That is true whether the earlier decision was decided by the same court or by a different court, although it is more likely to appear as a gratuitous insult when applied to another court. The phrase is an awkward and inappropriate way of indicating the need for restraint on the part of an appellate court when refusing to follow an earlier decision of its own or of another intermediate appellate court. 

35The inappropriateness of the whole exercise becomes apparent when, as in the present case, this Court has declined to depart from a line of its own authority, but the court of another jurisdiction declares that line to be ""plainly wrong"". Is this Court only entitled to follow its own earlier line of authority if it declares that the decision finding its earlier authority plainly wrong was itself ""plainly wrong""? That issue has been addressed and resolved in a sensible manner by the Victorian Court of Appeal in two decisions. In RJE, the Victorian Court was required to determine whether or not it should follow an earlier decision of its own. In joint reasons, Maxwell P and Weinberg JA accepted that they should do so unless they regarded the earlier decision as clearly or plainly wrong, which, in the instant case, they did: at [48]. However, the position was, as they explained, ""complicated"" by a decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal which had followed the earlier Victorian authority because at least a majority of that Court was not persuaded that the Victorian authority was clearly wrong: Tillman v Attorney General (NSW) [2007] NSWCA 327; 70 NSWLR 448 at [88] (Giles and Ipp JJA, Mason P dissenting). The Victorian Court, being persuaded that its own earlier authority was clearly wrong, noted that the issue involved ""a question which directly affects the liberty of the subject and there is good reason why the error should not be perpetuated"": at [48]. The Court also placed some weight, at least implicitly, on the fact that the majority in Tillman would also ""if unconstrained"" have reached the same conclusion: at [49]. 

36The Victorian Court of Appeal also took into account a practical consideration and a doubt as to the legal principle adopted in Farah Constructions in the High Court. In issue in RJE was the meaning of the word ""likely"" in relation to an offender thought likely to commit a further offence if released on completion of a custodial sentence, pursuant to s 11(1) of the Serious Sex Offenders Monitoring Act 2005 (Vic). There was similar legislation in New South Wales (the subject of Tillman and other authorities) and, although the language used was not to be found in national legislation, the Court fairly stated that ""it would be facile to construe the Monitoring Act as if it were unique to Victoria and the problem of its construction were of merely parochial concern"": at [50] (Maxwell P and Weinberg JA) and at [104] (Nettle JA). 

37The Victorian Court of Appeal returned to the issue in Director of Public Prosecution v Patrick Stevedores Holdings Pty Ltd [2012] VSCA 300; 296 ALR 156 at [128], where Maxwell P, Weinberg JA and Ferguson AJA stated:

""In our opinion, an intermediate appellate court such as our own, faced with conflicting decisions of other intermediate appellate courts, is not bound to follow any one of those decisions. The position might be different if, post-Farah, an intermediate appellate court had said that an earlier decision of that court, or of another intermediate appellate court, was plainly wrong. In such circumstances, this Court might be bound to follow the later decision unless we took the view that the later decision was 'plainly wrong'. Failing that, this Court is at liberty to state the law as it thinks appropriate.""

38Although the comments in Patrick Stevedores deal directly with the situation faced by this Court, there are two reasons for not following that approach. First, it implies that Farah Constructions is the final statement of the High Court as to the doctrine of precedent, despite what was later said in Walker Corporation Pty Ltd v Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority[2008 HCA 5; 233 CLR 259.  Secondly, it is not conducive to the orderly administration of justice for intermediate courts of appeal to characterise or even to routinely consider characterising the judgments of their colleagues in other jurisdictions as ""plainly wrong"".

39The first reason concerns the state of authority in the High Court with respect to such matters. As noted in RJE, on 27 February 2008, the Court adopted, without reference to Farah Constructions (delivered on 24 May 2007 by a similarly constituted Court), the following statement of McHugh J in Marshall v Director-General, Department of Transport [2001] HCA 37; 205 CLR 603 at [62], in relation to a particular phrase used in the legislation of various jurisdictions:

""But that does not mean that the courts of Queensland, when construing the legislation of that State, should slavishly follow judicial decisions of the courts of another jurisdiction in respect of similar or even identical legislation. ... Judicial decisions on similar or identical legislation in other jurisdictions are guides to, but cannot control, the meaning of legislation in the court's jurisdiction. Judicial decisions are not substitutes for the text of legislation although, by reason of the doctrine of precedent and the hierarchical nature of our court system, particular courts may be bound to apply the decision of a particular court as to the meaning of legislation.""

See Walker Corporation at 31, relied on by Maxwell P and Weinberg JA in RJE at [52] and by Nettle JA at [103]. (Nettle JA did not agree that the Court should depart from the earlier line of authority on that basis, but was able to achieve the same result by reliance on the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic).)

40Uncertain though the state of current authority is, the course this Court should take in all the circumstances is to determine for itself the correct approach to the statutory provision, giving proper consideration to the reasoning and conclusions of earlier authorities, both in this Court and in the Victorian Court of Appeal.

(b) should the Court now follow Shamouil?
41In Shamouil, Spigelman CJ stated at [60]:

""The preponderant body of authority in this Court is in favour of a restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility are to be taken into account in determining the probative value of evidence for purposes of determining questions of admissibility.""

42There are a number of points to make in relation to this statement. First, s 137 only requires the court to balance different qualities of particular evidence proffered by the prosecution (namely, probative value and unfair prejudice). It does not require assessment of the proffered evidence by reference to other aspects of the prosecution case. Nor does it require a balancing of the proffered evidence against conflicting evidence likely to be led for the defence: cf R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [43] (Simpson J). 

43Secondly, the proposition is concerned with issues of ""reliability and credibility"". It does not deny that an assessment must be made of the ""probative value"" of the proffered evidence. Rather, the Chief Justice noted the definition of ""probative value"" in the Dictionary to the Act as meaning ""the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue"": at [61]. He noted that ""[t]he focus on capability draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude"": at [61]. He further opined that reference in the definition to how the evidence could ""rationally"" affect the probability of a fact also directed attention ""to capability rather than weight"": at [62]. This proposition may be thought ambiguous, in that assessing ""the extent"" to which evidence could affect the probability of a fact is to assess its weight. Read in context, the reference to ""weight"" should be understood as a reference to the weight likely to be given to the evidence by the jury, acting rationally. It is that exercise which was rejected at [61].

44Thirdly, adoption of ""a restrictive approach"" was not intended to exclude all consideration of credibility and reliability. There must be, as the Chief Justice noted, an initial assessment as to whether it was open to a jury acting reasonably to use the proffered evidence in assessing the existence of a fact. If the trial judge were satisfied that evidence could not rationally affect the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue, it would not be relevant evidence and would therefore not be admissible: Evidence Act, ss 55 and 56. That, however, is not the end of the exercise. The extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the probability of a fact in issue involves an evaluative judgment. That judgment is not a forecast of the weight the jury is likely to give the evidence, nor is it a statement of the weight the judge would give the evidence. That is so for a number of reasons. For example, the evidence is being assessed in isolation: its ultimate weight will often depend upon circumstances not yet fully revealed. Were that not so, a different assessment might be made depending on the stage at which the question of admissibility was determined. Often it will be determined on a voir dire before the trial properly opens. It would be most unfortunate if the prosecution were required in some manner to call the whole of its case to demonstrate the probative value which the evidence, seen in context, would provide. Further, even if some overall assessment were required, as may be necessary in applying the s 5F(3A) test, it is likely to be undertaken, properly, on the papers and not by calling oral testimony. 

45Fourthly, the reasoning in Shamouil should not be extracted from its factual context. Mr Shamouil was charged with shooting a Mr Dawood (the victim). Shortly after he was shot, the victim provided a detailed description of the shooter to police. Less than three weeks later, he identified the shooter from a board containing 20 photographs. He later made a statement retracting his evidence. If his evidence had gone to a jury (as it did), there would have been issues as to credibility and as to the reliability of identification evidence, with its notorious difficulties. It was in this context that Spigelman CJ sought to focus on ""what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude"" and reject consideration of ""what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude"": at [61]. 

46Fifthly, Spigelman CJ did not deny the need to assess the probative value of the evidence, taken at its highest, for the purpose of the ""weighing"" exercise prescribed by s 137. When discussing unfair prejudice, the Chief Justice referred to the following passage in the judgment of McHugh J in Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593 at [51]:

""It is only when the probative value of evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect that the Crown can be deprived of the use of relevant but weak evidence. ... It is prejudicial only when the jury are likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserves or when the nature or content of the evidence may inflame the jury or divert the jurors from their task.""

47The Chief Justice then noted at [74] in Shamouil:

""[the trial judge] said that 'juries can be seduced by unreliable identification evidence'. It was this which his Honour identified as constituting the 'real danger of unfair prejudice'. In this analysis his Honour makes no reference to the warning about unreliable evidence under s 165. Such a warning must be taken into account before drawing the conclusion that such prejudice as may arise would be 'unfair'.""

48Two factors are apparent from these passages. First, in carrying out the ""weighing"" exercise, it would be necessary for the trial judge to consider where the prosecution evidence fell on a scale of probative value ranging from strong to weak. Secondly, the unreliability of the evidence was a factor to be weighed on the other side of the scale, together with the likely effectiveness of warnings about the nature of such unreliability. In effect, Shamouil requires careful attention to the language of the statute and the exercises required to be undertaken: the judgment must be read as a whole. The prosecution is entitled to have its evidence assessed according to its capacity to support the prosecution case, which is not to say that the reliability of the evidence may not be a factor, at least in some cases, in applying the test provided in s 137.

49The discussion of Shamouil in Dupas (2012) tended to extract and address the early passages (as to removing credibility and reliability from the assessment of probative value), as if they denied the need to assess probative value for the purpose of the weighing exercise. That Spigelman CJ undertook this task is not in doubt; what he did not do was determine whether the jury would reject the retraction (the credibility issue): at [78]. It may be noted that the term ""credibility"" has both a common meaning and a statutory meaning. Its common meaning (or one such meaning) is whether the witness is to be believed. That is often distinguished from the question whether the evidence, objectively considered, is plausible. Thus, plausibility may well affect an assessment of credibility, but will leave open a conclusion that the witness genuinely believes that he or she is telling the truth but the evidence is objectively implausible. The statutory definition of ""credibility"", on the other hand, when applied to a witness, includes ""the witness' ability to observe or remember facts and events"", the subject of the evidence. This latter element would often be defined as ""reliability"", which suggests that in the statements in Shamouil, ""credibility"" was used in some more limited sense.

50To understand why Dupas (2012) held Shamouil clearly wrong it is convenient to set out the principles articulated by the Victorian Court at [63]:

""(a) The common law did require the trial judge, in assessing probative value, to evaluate the weight that the jury could rationally attach to the evidence. The contrary conclusion was inconsistent with a continuous line of High Court authority.

(b) The legislative intention, as disclosed by the language of s 137 and its context, is that the task under s 137 is the same as that at common law. 

(c) The trial judge undertaking the balancing task is only obliged to assume that the jury will accept the evidence to be truthful but is not required to make an assumption that its reliability will be accepted. The phrase 'taken at its highest' is more appropriately used in considering a no case submission, when the judge must accept that the jury may find the evidence credible and reliable. 

(d) In order to determine the capacity of the evidence rationally to affect the determination of a fact in issue, the judge is required to make some assessment of the weight that the jury could, acting reasonably, give to that evidence. Where it is contended that the quality or frailties of the evidence would result in the jury attaching more weight to the evidence than it deserved, the trial judge is obliged to assess the extent of the risk. That does not require the trial judge to anticipate the weight that the jury would or will attach to it. The judge is obliged to assess what probative value the jury could assign to the evidence, against which must be balanced the risk that the jury will give the evidence disproportionate weight. 

(e) So to construe s 137 accords with the language of the statute and its context. To construe it otherwise does not. 

(f) Such a construction does not involve any enlargement of the powers of a trial judge or any encroachment upon the traditional jury function.""

51As Shamouil was held to be ""manifestly wrong"", it is also necessary to determine the point of departure identified in these principles. There appears to be one point only, which appears in paragraph (c). Whilst accepting that the trial judge must assume that the jury will accept the evidence to be truthful [perhaps a reference to ""credibility"" in the sense used in Shamouil] the judge is nevertheless ""not required to make an assumption that its reliability will be accepted"". The next sentence, dealing with the use of language in a ""no case submission"" context, is beside the point. However, if (c) is an introduction to the exercise identified in (d), it is by no means clear that even this point is a significant difference between the Dupas principles and Shamouil, read in full. 

52Paragraph (d) addresses the ""weight"" which the jury ""could"", not ""would"" or ""will"", give the evidence. That statement is consistent with Shamouil and appropriate as far as it goes. However, the second limb of s 137 requires an assessment of ""the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant"". The possibility of prejudice could extend beyond giving the evidence undue weight and may extend to compelling (in a practical sense) the accused to give an explanation in the witness box which will reveal prejudicial information not part of the prosecution case. An example would be evidence of flight from police, which might be relied upon as giving rise to an inference of consciousness of guilt of the offence charged, whereas the alternative explanation might involve revelation that the accused feared arrest for an entirely separate offence: see R v Cook, above at [42].

53In truth, the statement of principles was probably not intended to be read as comprehensive. In a case of conflicting inferences, at least where one inference gives rise to a risk of unfair prejudice and the other supports the prosecution case, Shamouil and Dupas (2012) are to similar effect. The Court in Dupas stated at [114]:

""As Domican v The Queen [[1992] HCA13; 173 CLR 555] illustrates, a primary consideration which informs the exercise of the discretion is that the dangers of possible misuse by the jury of such evidence will ordinarily be able to be addressed by the giving of appropriate directions by the trial judge. Deficiencies in the evidence do not, in most circumstances, lead to exclusion, either because of the weight that could properly be given to it or because directions would remove, or reduce, the risks of prejudice or a combination of the two.""

See also at [142].

54Further, one curious omission from the analysis of common law principles undertaken in Dupas (2012) was the discussion in an earlier judgment of the Court in respect of the same evidence which had resulted in a retrial and second conviction, being the subject of Dupas (2012). Thus, in The Queen v Dupas (No 3) [2009] VSCA 202; 198 A Crim R 454 (""Dupas (No 3)""), a Court comprising Nettle, Ashley and Weinberg JJA had unanimously concluded that the refusal of the trial judge to exclude the same identification evidence was not erroneous. The discussion of that particular ground appears in the judgment of Weinberg JA. (A retrial was ordered on other grounds.) After noting the existence of the discretionary power to exclude evidence, Weinberg JA continued:

""259 It is important to note that the only basis upon which the identification evidence was sought to be excluded was the Christie discretion. However, even assuming that there was a question as to the reliability of some of that evidence, it is by no means clear that that would trigger the operation of that discretion.

260 In R v Peirce, Vincent J (as he then was) considered some of the authorities bearing upon the exercise of the Christie discretion in relation to evidence said to be unreliable. His Honour did so in the context of testimony sought to be led from an unindemnified accomplice of the accused. He accepted the theoretical possibility that such evidence could be excluded in the exercise of this discretion, but said that the occasions upon which that might occur would be few and far between. Normally the issues raised would be left to the jury as matters of credibility for their determination. 

261 A similar conclusion was reached by the Victorian Full Court in Rozenes v Beljajev, where it was said that there was no example, of which the Court was aware, of the actual exclusion of the evidence of an accomplice on the sole ground of its unreliability.""

262 There are many instances in the cases of identification evidence that could be said to be suspect having nonetheless been admitted. As will be seen, Domican v The Queen provides a paradigm example. The safeguard against the possible misuse by the jury of such evidence is normally the giving of appropriate directions by the trial judge.""

55Weinberg JA then cited a lengthy passage from the judgment of Gleeson CJ in Festa which demonstrated why it was that questions of weight and reliability were generally not critical in relation to admissibility. The Chief Justice stated in part:

""Questions as to the admissibility of evidence may be related to, but are different from, questions as to whether the totality of the evidence in a case is sufficient to sustain a jury's verdict, or questions as to the warnings that need to be given to a jury about the use that may properly be made of the evidence. If evidence is of some, albeit slight, probative value, then it is admissible unless some principle of exclusion comes into play to justify withholding it from a jury's consideration. It is not enough to say that it is 'weak', and, as already mentioned, whether it is weak might depend on what use is made of it. The totality of the evidence may be such as to render a conviction unsafe. But that does not affect admissibility.""

56Although dealing with a common law discretion, the reasoning in Dupas (No 3) provided significant support for the analysis accepted in Shamouil. 

57There are other respects in which the reasoning in Dupas (2012) must be approached with care. Rather than commencing with a consideration of the terms of s 137, the analysis first undertakes a lengthy dissertation on the ""position at common law"": at [69]-[142]. The analysis covers a range of case law applying ""the Christie discretion"", derived from the decision of the House of Lords in R v Christie [1914] AC 545. In discussing the language of s 137, the Court concluded at [164]:

""It is presumed that a statute is not intended (in the absence of express words) to alter common law doctrines. A strict reading and careful scrutiny of the language of the Act is therefore necessary, in order to determine whether it was the will of the legislature to remove or encroach upon those doctrines.""

58Four authorities were cited to support that proposition, namely FCT v Citibank Ltd (1989) 20 FCR 403, 433 (French J); Bropho v State of WA (1990) 171 CLR 1, 18; Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 427, 437 and Ballog v ICAC (1990) 169 CLR 625, 635. However, those cases do not demand that a strict reading and careful scrutiny of statutory language is required in order to determine whether the legislature has sought to alter ""common law doctrines"". The cases establish a far more limited proposition, namely that express language is required to abrogate or curtail ""a fundamental right, freedom or immunity"", on the basis that the courts ""should not impute to the legislature an intention to interfere with fundamental rights"": Coco at 437 (Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ). As explained by McHugh J in Malika Holdings Pty Ltd v Stretton [2001] HCA 14; 204 CLR 290, at [28], no such assumption can operate uniformly in respect of common law principles more generally.

59The Court in Dupas (2012) then concluded that an examination of the Act revealed ""no such intention"" to vary the common law: [164]. That is a curious conclusion in respect of ""the Christie discretion"". Section 137 does not confer a power to exclude in the discretion of the court: rather, it obliges exclusion in prescribed circumstances, which require an evaluative judgment by the court.

60The Court in Dupas (2012) noted the discussion in Shamouil at [77] and reached a similar conclusion itself at [176]-[177]. It did not, however, consider whether this reading might lead it to qualify what it had treated as an absolute and unqualified exclusion of any reference by the trial judge to questions of reliability. Had further consideration been given to such matters, the apparent differences perceived in the statements of Allsop P in DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63 at [98]-[99] and of Bathurst CJ in DSJ might have been resolved: Dupas at [209]-[211].

61Once it is accepted that the Evidence Act has changed the common law in a significant manner, attention must be paid to the language of the statute as the primary source of the law: Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at [10] (Gleeson CJ and Hayne J); [46] and [51] (Gaudron and Kirby JJ); [74] (McHugh J).

62On the facts of Shamouil, the jury would be asked, if the evidence were admitted, to choose between an apparently clear and firm opinion of the witness as to who his assailant was and what he looked like and his subsequent retraction. As the Chief Justice noted, a jury ""could well take the view that the attempt to retract the identification evidence was unconvincing and a manifestation of either a threat of reprisals or of a desire, within a close knit ethnic community, to resolve matters amongst themselves, without the interference of the State"": at [42]. It was the resolution of that dispute that the Chief Justice correctly held was a matter for the jury and not for the trial judge, even on an assessment under s 137. However, to suggest that Spigelman CJ rejected as inappropriate any reference to the weight of the proffered evidence, if accepted, was to mischaracterise what followed in a consideration of the ""weighing"" exercise, at [70]-[78]. Thus, Dupas (2012) erroneously treated Shamouil as concluding, inflexibly and without qualification, that the weight of the evidence was irrelevant.

63The judgment of Weinberg JA in Dupas (No 3) was discussed in Dupas (2012), without adverse criticism: at [234]-[235]. The Court further noted that the trial judge on the retrial had correctly observed that a different approach was required under s 137, which ""did not involve the exercise of any discretion and that, if the statutory requirements were met, the evidence must be excluded"": at [237]. The trial judge had then reassessed the evidence as presented before her and come to the same conclusion as the Court of Appeal under the common law test, namely that none of the identification evidence should be excluded under s 137. In Dupas (2012), the Court of Appeal stated at [240]:

""Her Honour did consider the asserted infirmities of the identification evidence of each witness. She agreed with, and adopted, the conclusions of the Court of Appeal concerning that evidence, which included findings that the evidence of [two witnesses] was weak. That conclusion rested upon a consideration of the matters that affected the reliability of their identification evidence. ... But the trial judge also rejected the contention that there was a risk that the jury would give such evidence more weight than it deserved. Furthermore, her Honour explicitly stated that she was satisfied that appropriate directions could be given in relation to each of the pieces of identification evidence which would be sufficient to avoid any unfair prejudice. Thus, notwithstanding her understanding that the preponderance of authority restricted the extent to which she could take account of the reliability of the evidence, her Honour approached the balancing task in the same manner as had the Court of Appeal. The trial judge took account of the weight that could properly be assigned to that evidence and concluded that there was no danger that it would be given greater weight or that it would not be addressed by appropriate directions.""

64The Court of Appeal found no error in this approach, despite the adoption of the ""restricted"" view to the way in which a trial judge should assess reliability. The Court of Appeal then noted that, on its own authority, it was necessary for the Court to ""decide for itself whether the decision under s 137 was correct"": at [241]. Without undertaking any different exercise from that undertaken by the trial judge, the Court expressed its agreement with her conclusions. It is therefore far from clear that Dupas (2012) in fact adopted any different approach from that which would be adopted in this Court.

65It being also doubtful as to how far Dupas (2012) departed from the principles stated in Shamouil, read in context, and because the present case raises a slightly different issue from either (not being concerned with identification evidence) there is no compelling reason to depart from the general approach accepted in Shamouil.

Application of principles - s 137
66The importance of Shamouil lies not in the precise language used (the judgment is not to be treated as a statute) but in the general principle it articulates. The operation of that principle may vary depending upon the circumstances of the case. In broad terms, the principle has three elements:

(1) in determining inadmissibility under s 137, the judge should assess the evidence proffered by the prosecution on the basis of its capacity to advance the prosecution case;

(2) it follows from (1) that the judge should deal with the evidence on the basis of any inference or direct support for a fact in issue which would be available to a reasonable jury considering the proffered evidence, without speculating as to whether the jury would in fact accept the evidence and give it particular weight;

(3) it also follows from (1) that the judge should not make his or her own findings as to whether or not to accept the inference or give the evidence particular weight.

67This principle does not produce uniformity of approach in all cases. The ""weighing"" exercise required if s 137 is engaged not only involves incommensurates, but elements that may interrelate in a variety of ways. For example, in the present case there are a number of possible inferences to be drawn from the recorded conversations. Those on which the prosecution relied, based on the key response of the accused set out at [8] above, were that his response -

(a) was made after he had identified who the complainant was;
(b) involved a realisation that she was referring to sexual activities between them, and
(c) involved acceptance of the occurrence of such activities.

Other available inferences were, for example, that:

(d) the respondent had not correctly identified the complainant;
(e) whether he had or not, he guessed she was referring to sexual activities and gave a jocular response, and 
(f) even if there had been some form of acceptance of her suggestion, because no particular activities had been identified, his admission could not support any particular count in the indictment.

68Determining which inferences should be accepted was quintessentially a function for the jury. Before the exclusionary obligation in s 137 could arise, the judge had to identify the relevant ""unfair prejudice"". That meant identifying how the evidence (if admitted) would be left to a jury and wherein lay the risk of misuse. No particular element of prejudice was identified. Had it been, the risk that a jury would not appreciate the nature of the problem after proper direction had then to be assessed. The trial judge did not undertake that exercise because the previous step had not been taken. That was an error of law: it is not necessary to consider the question identified as (2)(a) at [22] above.

69If the trial judge erred, should this Court undertake the proper analysis? The parties accepted that that would be the proper course. Accordingly, it is necessary to ask what form of ""unfair prejudice"" the respondent relied on. In his written submissions the respondent's counsel stated:

""The primary basis for excluding the evidence was the vagueness of the allegation put to the respondent ... with the consequence that his admission ... was unreliable as evidence that he had sexually assaulted the complainant when she was under the age of 10 years. The respondent certainly impliedly admitted that he 'did' something, but the nature of the allegation meant that it was far from certain what it was that he was admitting he did. ... [T]he low probative value of the evidence meant that exclusion was mandated because of the danger that a jury would use the evidence for an impermissible tendency inference.""

70The nature of the ""tendency inference"" was explained later in the submissions (paragraph 33) in the following terms:

""[The trial judge] did not hold that there was a danger of unfair prejudice on the basis that the jury would not be able adequately to assess the strength of the competing inferences. Rather, it was held that there was a danger that the jury would infer that the respondent was admitting to 'some sexual activity with a high school student' and use that prejudicially against the respondent. ... It was also open to her Honour to hold, implicitly, that judicial directions could not be certain to overcome such prejudice ....""

71The submission is based on the possible inference that, in the second conversation, the accused believed that he was speaking to somebody else with whom he had had a sexual relationship whilst she was a high school student. That is an inference that is open. However, the alternative inference is that the remark relied upon, which came late in the second conversation, was made at a stage when the accused had demonstrated that he knew to whom he was talking and the subject-matter of her allegation and was attempting to diminish the seriousness of his misconduct.

72The jury could readily be directed as to the alternative inferences. If they drew the inference favourable to the prosecution, there would be no risk of unfair prejudice. However, it would be necessary to direct the jury that, if they preferred the view that the accused was referring to a sexual liaison with another girl, then in high school, no possible inference could be drawn as to whether or not the complainant's allegations were true. The suggestion that the jury could not or would not understand and apply such a direction should not be entertained. Any risk of unfair prejudice on this account was fanciful and should be rejected. Accordingly, there was no basis to exercise the exclusionary rule in s 137.

73Because no real risk of unfair prejudice arose, and s 137, for that reason, was not engaged, there was no occasion to assess the ""probative value"" of the evidence. It follows that there is in this case no choice to be made between the principles derived from Shamouil and those articulated in Dupas. However, at least in these circumstances, the Shamouil approach demonstrates how s 137 operates. The trial judge may need to consider the weight to be given to each possible set of inferences, without accepting or rejecting either. That is consistent with the approach adopted in Sood. 

Section 90 - unfairness 
74The second basis for rejecting the evidence (dealt with before s 137 in the reasons of the trial judge) was the operation of s 90 of the Evidence Act. Each of the statements concerning reliability appears to have been part of the reasoning that it would be ""unfair"" to permit the use of the evidence. However, it cannot be ""unfair"" to allow the prosecution case to be put to the jury if the evidence is capable of supporting a conviction unless there is some other factor at play. Relevant factors have generally been considered to be either the potential for the evidence to be misused (for example where the evidence or any possible response indicates misconduct on another occasion), or potential weaknesses in the evidence which may not be adequately assessed by a jury, properly directed. In the present case, reliance was placed upon the fact that the accused might be forced to relinquish his ""right to silence"" in the face of such evidence, in order to provide an explanation to the jury.

75There are three problems with this approach. The first is that the accused has no ""right to silence"" in the sense that evidence cannot be admitted which, in practical terms, will demand an explanation. It is often a forensic decision for an accused and his or her counsel as to whether he or she will give evidence as part of the defence: that circumstance does not involve any abrogation of some common law immunity.

76Secondly, there was a degree of inconsistency between the reason for excluding the evidence, namely its weak probative value, or unreliability, and the perceived need to provide an answer. Thirdly, if in a practical sense, the respondent would feel compelled to testify, it would be to reject the complainant's direct evidence as to his conduct. 

77No basis for excluding the evidence under s 90 was made good.

Jurisdiction to intervene
78The fact that error has been identified in the approach adopted by the trial judge does not entail the further conclusion that s 5F(3A) is necessarily engaged. That provision requires the appellate court to consider the part played by the excluded evidence in the prosecution case. Given that the proposed appeal arises at an interlocutory stage, and that the weighing exercise must be undertaken by the appellate court itself, it is clear that the exercise will be undertaken ""on the papers"".

79In Shamouil the Chief Justice dealt with the approach to be adopted under s 5F(3A) in the following terms:

""39 ... The jurisdictional issue posed for this Court under s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act is not intended to involve an inquiry into the weight to be given to the evidence excluded. Questions of weight are for the jury. The section directs attention to 'the prosecution's case', to be considered as a 'case'. This section is not concerned with the weight of the Crown's evidence.

40 This Court should determine whether or not a ruling on the admissibility of evidence 'substantially weakens' the Crown case by asking whether or not that would be the effect, on the assumption that the jury accepted the evidence, as long as the evidence was fit to be left to the jury. It is not desirable for this Court to undertake an investigation into the weight of the evidence based on credibility or reliability considerations.""

80That is not to say that the appellate court should not note possible weaknesses in the prosecution case and the manner in which one piece of evidence may strengthen the probative value of other evidence. Thus, in the present case, the critical evidence which must be accepted by the jury for the prosecution to succeed will be that of the complainant. If the jury accepts the complainant as a witness of truth, it may be satisfied as to her evidence in respect of each count. Alternatively, it may have doubts with respect to some parts of her evidence, but not others. The supportive evidence has been noted above as involving four elements. These were, (1) the complainant's statement; (2) her mother's statement; (3) the photograph of the respondent's penis, and (4) the telephone conversations: at [5]-[7] above. None will confirm each count and, although highly persuasive as photographic evidence, the pictures of the apparent lesion on the tip of the respondent's penis is subject to the temporal limitations already noted. It follows that the exclusion of any part of the supportive evidence could substantially weaken the prosecution case.

81Despite the lack of particularity of the conduct complained of in the first telephone conversation, if the jury accepted the respondent's remark as an admission, it would significantly bolster the complainant's credibility, although it did not directly relate to any particular count. Nevertheless, its removal would clearly weaken the prosecution case to a substantial extent. The Court therefore has jurisdiction to intervene on the application of the Director.

Conclusion
82For these reasons, the Court should make the following orders:

(1) Set aside the decision made in the Parramatta District Court on 6 November 2012 excluding evidence of two recorded telephone calls between the accused and the complainant, made on 25 August 2011.

(2) Declare that records of the two telephone conversations between the complainant and the respondent were not rendered inadmissible by either s 90 or s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).

83HOEBEN CJ at CL: As Simpson J has pointed out, for the Court to have jurisdiction to hear this application, the Director of Public Prosecutions (the Director) had to establish that the rejection by the District Court of the evidence of the telephone calls eliminated or substantially weakened the prosecution case (s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912). The Director submitted that by reason of the exclusion of that evidence, the prosecution case had been substantially weakened. That issue was disputed in this Court. 

84On that issue I agree with Simpson J that this Court is to assume an interpretation of the evidence most favourable to the prosecution - i.e., that the respondent acknowledged having had some sexual engagement with the complainant at the time when he had contact with her family. The Court should then determine whether the exclusion of that evidence would substantially weaken the prosecution case. For the reasons given by her Honour, I agree that the excluded evidence meets the test of ""substantially weaken"" in s5F(3A). I express no opinion as to the application of s294AA of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

85I also agree for the reasons given by Basten JA and Simpson J that the primary judge erred in the application of s90 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). There was nothing in the circumstances in which the telephone conversations took place that renders their admission unfair.

86In relation to s137 of the Evidence Act 1995, subject to the following observations, I agree with Basten JA and Simpson J that when assessing the probative value of the prosecution evidence sought to be excluded, the Court should not consider its credibility, reliability or weight. I specifically adopt what was said by Basten JA at [66] - [67].

87Accordingly, I agree that the Courts of NSW should follow R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 when applying s137 of the Evidence Act 1995.

88Where I differ from their Honours is as follows. When assessing the probative value of the prosecution evidence sought to be excluded, i.e., its capacity to support the prosecution case, a court can take into account the fact of competing inferences which might be available on the evidence, as distinct from determining which inference or inferences should be or are most likely to be preferred. It was that to which the court was referring in DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9 at [10] (Bathurst CJ); [11] (Allsop P) and [78] (Whealy JA).

89Here, as Basten JA, Blanch and Price JJ have pointed out, there were alternative inferences available which were inconsistent with the prosecution case and which were objectively plausible. That is a matter which can properly be taken into account when carrying out the balancing exercise required by s137 to determine whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.

90As a result I have reached a different conclusion to that of Basten JA and Simpson J when applying s137 to the facts of this case. When carrying out the balancing exercise, to determine whether the probative value of the prosecution evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect, I have concluded that its probative value is so outweighed. I have concluded that there is a significant risk that the jury would give the evidence more weight than it deserves and that the content of the evidence might ""inflame the jury or divert the jurors from their task"" (Festa v R [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593 at [51] (McHugh J)).

91As Blanch J said ""In the emotionally charged atmosphere of a child sexual assault trial evidence disclosing the respondent's promiscuity and interest in high school girls"" is likely to create substantial and unfair prejudice towards him. There is a real danger of the jury using tendency reasoning to arrive at their verdict. The risk is such that it could not be adequately met by a direction from the trial judge.

92It follows that the evidence of the telephone calls between the complainant and the respondent was correctly rejected by the primary judge.

93I would dismiss the appeal.

94SIMPSON J: Pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Director of Public Prosecutions (""the Director"") appeals against a decision or ruling in the District Court in respect of the admissibility of certain evidence proposed to be tendered in a criminal trial. Such an appeal lies only where the Director establishes that the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution case. 

95The ruling here in question was to exclude evidence the prosecution proposed to tender. The Director does not suggest that the ruling eliminates the prosecution case; he contends that, by reason of the exclusion of the evidence, the prosecution case is substantially weakened. That in itself is in issue. The respondent contends that the decision to exclude the evidence lacks that quality. If the exclusion of the evidence does not substantially weaken the prosecution case, there is no jurisdiction in this Court to entertain the appeal and review the ruling.

96The issue on the appeal, should the Director establish that the Court has jurisdiction, raises, inter alia, the approach to be taken by a court in criminal proceedings when objection is taken to evidence on the basis provided by s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 - that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.

97The issue is important because prior decisions of this Court (for example R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52; R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228; R v Suman Sood [2007] NSWCCA 214; R v Mundine [2008] NSWCCA 55; 182 A Crim R 302) and a recent decision of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria (Dupas v The Queen [2012] VSCA 328) are in sharp conflict. Put shortly, in this Court it has consistently been held that where a court is considering objection to evidence invoking s 137, questions of credibility, reliability or the weight to be attributed to the evidence in question has no part to play in the decision. In Dupas, a five judge bench of the Victorian Court of Appeal held that approach to be ""manifestly wrong"". It was the perceived need to resolve that conflict that gave rise to the convening of a five judge bench.

98Before this Court can come to deal with that issue, it is necessary to consider the jurisdictional question.

Background

99On 5 November 2012 the respondent was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing six counts. Five were of indecent assault brought under s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900. The sixth was of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, brought under s 61J of the Crimes Act. The circumstance of aggravation alleged was that the complainant was under the age of 16 years.

100All offences were alleged to have been committed against the same complainant, between 1 February 2002 and 31 October 2002. Throughout that time the complainant was eight years of age. 

101On arraignment, the respondent entered a plea of not guilty to each charge. Before a jury was empanelled, an issue arose concerning the admissibility of two aspects of evidence proposed to be adduced in the prosecution case. A voir dire took place, at the conclusion of which the trial judge ruled that none of the evidence would be admitted. She gave detailed reasons for her decision. In order to allow the Director to test the ruling the trial did not further proceed.

102This appeal concerns one part only of the evidence then in question. I will return to that.

The case the prosecution proposed to present at trial

103Since no evidence was called in the aborted trial, the material available to this Court consists of statements of intended witnesses, and tape recordings of two telephone conversations between the complainant and the respondent that took place on 25 August 2011 and were recorded pursuant to a warrant issued in this Court under the Surveillance Devices Act 2007. The telephone calls were initiated by the complainant, under the supervision of police investigating the complaints she had previously made, for the express purpose of engaging the respondent in conversation about her allegations, in the expectation or hope that he would incriminate himself. The only reason that there were two telephone calls is that, after a short time, the first call disconnected. The complainant almost immediately called again. It is the content of these conversations that constitutes the evidence the subject of the voir dire, and the subject of the present appeal. The content of the conversations is fully set out in the judgments of Basten JA and Blanch J, and I do not propose to repeat it, save so far as is necessary to explain the reasons for coming to the views that I have.

104The central evidence in the prosecution case is that of the complainant. Her statement was made on 7 June 2011, nine years after the alleged offences, when the complainant was 17 years of age. Other proposed witnesses who provided statements were:


the complainant's mother; 
the complainant's mother's de facto husband; 
KL (junior), a neighbour and friend of the complainant; 
Ms Vicki O'Neill; 
Dr Maria Nittis; 
Detective Senior Constable Erin Stubberfield.

The complainant's statement

105The complainant says in her statement that, in 2002, she lived with her mother, her two younger sisters, and her mother's de facto husband (RB) in a western suburb of Sydney. The respondent was a close friend of RB, and a regular visitor to the complainant's home. The complainant gave an account of a number of occasions on which, she said, the respondent had sexually interfered with her. It is unnecessary to recount the detail of her allegations. It is sufficient to note that, as is usual in such cases, there is nothing in her statement to suggest that any other potential witness was present on any such occasion. In that sense, the complainant's evidence is uncorroborated. 

106The complainant, in her statement, referring to one of the assaults, said that she was ""scared"", but remembered noticing a mole or sore on top of the respondent's penis towards its tip. 

107She also said that she had told her friend KL about the assaults, and that KL told her mother, as a result of which the complainant denied the truth of her allegations so that KL's mother would not tell the complainant's mother.

The statement of the complainant's mother

108The complainant's mother's statement potentially supports that of the complainant in two respects: (i) she gives accounts of two occasions on which the respondent was present at the house, in circumstances in which he was for a time alone with the complainant, and therefore had opportunity to engage in the conduct alleged, and on one of which he behaved in a manner that could be regarded as suspicious; (ii) she gives an account of an occasion when the complainant was 14 years of age (that is, about six years after the events of which she complains) on which the complainant exhibited signs of significant distress. According to her mother's statement, the complainant then said ""[the respondent] molested me"". The statement gives no indication that the complainant fixed a time or time period of the molestation. 

109According to the complainant's mother, in 2002 the family, including RB and the children, moved from the suburb in which they had been living, to a location some distance away, and had no further contact with the respondent, except for one occasion, about four years later, when she drove to the respondent's home to pick up RB. She saw the respondent ""briefly"" outside the house. The complainant was in the back seat of the car.

The statement of RB 

110RB's statement was made on 26 June 2012. He confirms his friendship with the respondent, and the respondent's regular visits to the complainant's home. More importantly, he gives an account of an occasion in about 2010 on which, after a dispute between himself and the complainant, the complainant said to him ""your friend [respondent's first name] raped me"". 

The statement of KL (junior)

111KL gives a date of birth which indicates that she is two years older than the complainant. She said that, for a period of about 12 months when she was 9 years of age, she was a near neighbour and a friend of the complainant. She gives evidence of complaint. She said that one afternoon after school, she and the complainant and one of the complainant's younger sisters were sitting on the back verandah of the complainant's home. She said that the complainant was crying. She said that she did not remember exactly what the complainant told her but:

""... I know she was hurt and something bad happened.""

She said that she told her mother of this but that her mother did not listen. [A statement made by KL's mother (also KL) was excluded by ruling of the trial judge. There is no appeal against that ruling.]

The statement of Vicki O'Neill 

112Ms O'Neill was a school administrator in the primary school attended by the complainant. The complainant attended the school between 13 May 2002 and 23 October 2002. The girls' school uniform was:

""White shirt, burgundy pants/shorts and a burgundy jumper ...""

The statement of Dr Maria Nitiss

113Dr Nitiss is a forensic physician specialising in sexual assault. She examined photographs of the respondent's penis that were provided to her. She did not examine the respondent. She observed on the photographs a red lesion on the head of the penis which did not appear to be the result of an acute sexually transmitted infection or common dermatitis, but which she could not exclude as a type of red coloured naevus (mole) or minor scar. She observed that an important question is whether the lesion was recent or of longstanding; if the former, then it was unlikely to be the lesion described by the complainant. However, if it were longstanding, then it provides some support to the complainant's allegations. Dr Nitiss was not able, on the photographic evidence, to determine into which category the lesion on the respondent's penis fell. She also cautioned that interpretation of injuries from photographs should be treated with caution, having regard to the quality of the final image (which, in this case, were of good quality).

The statement of Detective Senior Constable Erin Stubberfield

114Detective Senior Constable Stubberfield gives evidence of conversations with the complainant and with her mother, starting on 7 June 2011, and of taking statements from them. She was present when the complainant made the telephone calls to the respondent and the two conversations ensued. She recorded those conversations.

115Detective Stubberfield says that she then contacted the respondent, and introduced herself as a detective from Penrith, to which the respondent replied:

""I'm not talking to you, talk to my solicitor.""

116The transcript of the recorded conversations between the complainant and the respondent contains the following relevant passages. The complainant ascertained that she was speaking to the respondent, and identified herself by her first name, and as the daughter of RB's ""girlfriend"", whose first name she gave. After a short time, the respondent gave an indication that he remembered her and was aware of the identity of the caller and asked how she was doing. The following conversation then ensued:

""Complainant: Yeah, do you remember what you used to do me

Respondent: Yeah, fuckin oath and I wouldn't mind doing it again ... ha ha

...

Complainant: Um well you ruined my life cause of it ... you ruined my life ... you ruined my life

Respondent: How the fuck did I ruin your life

Complainant: My family don't believe that you did it to me ... my family didn't doesn't believe me

Respondent: That what I did to you

Complainant: Yeah and I got kicked out and all, so I'm going to the cops about it so 

Respondent: When did this happen anyway

Complainant: When I was eight years old you just admitted it

Respondent: Eight years old

Complainant: Yes I was eight years old at the time

Respondent: Eight years old 

Complainant: Remember you used to tell me I was bad and I was the bad one but now I'm old and now I know that you're the bad one 

Respondent: ... when you were in high school man not not eight years old

Complainant: I was eight years old 

Respondent: I remember you from high school, remember when you were wearing the maroon jackets and that and went to high school

Complainant: That was primary school

Respondent: Nah nah 

Complainant: Yes it was

Respondent: Blacktown Boys Blacktown Girls High

Complainant: No

Respondent: That's alright anyway I have QC barrister so you do what you want to do ok I will meet you up here see ya""

117The second conversation, which took place almost immediately after, consisted primarily of the respondent denying the very unspecific allegations put to him by the complainant, and appearing to deny recollection of what he had previously said.

Jurisdiction - Criminal Appeal Act, s 5F(3A)

118As I have indicated above, an appeal by the Director under s 5F(3A) lies in two circumstances - (i) where the exclusion of the evidence ""eliminates"" the prosecution case; (ii) where the exclusion of the evidence ""substantially weakens"" the prosecution case. Here, it is not, and could not be, suggested that the exclusion of the evidence of the respondent's response to the complainant's telephone call eliminates the prosecution case. The question is whether its exclusion ""substantially weakens"" the prosecution case. That calls for examination of the whole of the evidence in the prosecution case, and the relative importance of the evidence in question in that context. It is for that reason that I have outlined above the other evidence proposed to be adduced.

119Ironically enough, the evaluation of the importance of the evidence in question in the prosecution case involves a question similar to one which will be raised by the substantive appeal, should jurisdiction be established - to what extent, if at all, does this Court consider questions of the credibility, reliability, or weight of the evidence the subject of the appeal? In that context, in Shamouil, Spigelman CJ said:

""39. The issue is similar to that which arises when determining the probative value of evidence in the context of the application of s 137 of the Evidence Act, to which I will refer below. The jurisdictional issue posed for this Court under s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act is not intended to involve an inquiry into the weight to be given to the evidence excluded. Questions of weight are for the jury. The section directs attention to 'the prosecution's case', to be considered as a 'case'. This section is not concerned with the weight of the Crown's evidence.

40 This Court should determine whether or not a ruling on the admissibility of evidence 'substantially weakens' the Crown case by asking whether or not that would be the effect, on the assumption that the jury accepted the evidence, as long as the evidence was fit to be left to the jury. It is not desirable for this Court to undertake an investigation into the weight of the evidence based on credibility or reliability considerations.""

120This is, however, not a simple instance of such an evaluation. In one sense, no serious question of credibility or reliability arises. The tape recording of the respondent's conversation with the complainant is clear, and the transcription of what he said is not in dispute. The prosecution will seek to rely upon the respondent's responses to the complainant as admissions - that is, as previous representations made by the respondent that are adverse to his interest in the outcome of the proceeding (Evidence Act, Dictionary). In particular the prosecution will rely upon the respondent's answer:

""Yeah, fuckin oath and I wouldn't mind doing it again ... ha ha""

as an admission that he had sexually interfered with the complainant. The answer is far from an unequivocal or explicit acknowledgement to that effect. It was made in response to the complainant's question:

""Yeah, do you remember what you used to do me[?]""

That, itself, was far from an unequivocal or explicit accusation. And the question and answer followed an introduction in which, it might be thought, the respondent had to be reminded of who the complainant was. Further, as Price J has pointed out, the answer ought not to be seen in isolation from the whole of the conversation, including what followed - the respondent's insistence that whatever engagement he had had with the complainant occurred when she was in high school. That, in itself, has to be seen in the context of his assertion that he remembered the complainant at high school ""wearing a maroon jacket"". ""Maroon jacket"" is broadly consistent with the evidence of Ms O'Neill, the primary school administrator, that the complainant's primary school uniform included a ""burgundy jumper"". (There is no evidence of the complainant's uniform when she was at high school, and no evidence of the high school she attended.)

121However, it is not unimportant that the complainant's mother's evidence is that, in September 2002, the family moved from where they were living to a location some distance away, and had no further contact with the respondent (except for the occasion, in about 2006, when she picked up RB from the respondent's home while the complainant was in the back seat of the car).

122Just what is to be read into the respondent's conversation with the complainant is a matter for determination by the jury. Plainly, a variety of inferences are available. The conversation is capable of interpretation, as the Director would have it, as an acknowledgement that the respondent had engaged in conduct of the kind of which the complainant complains. Taking into account the evidence of the colour of her primary school uniform, and the dates on which the family were in contact with the respondent, it is capable of being related to the period of the alleged offending.

123It would also be open to the jury to take an adverse view of the respondent's subsequent denials, and his reference to having ""a QC barrister"" available.

124At the other end of the spectrum, his answers are capable of the interpretation that, whatever engagement with the complainant the respondent acknowledged, it took place at a significantly later time, when the complainant was in high school (although, having regard to the evidence of when the complainant was in contact with the respondent, that might be a difficult proposition). If the jury were to take that view, relatively benign to the respondent, then the evidence could have no probative value in relation to the offences charged, but a potentially significantly prejudicial effect in establishing the respondent's interest in the complainant, and his willingness to engage in sexual contact with a school girl (although it cannot unequivocally be assumed that she was under the statutory age of consent).

125It is also possible, as the trial judge thought, that the jury might take the view that the Crown had not established that the respondent recognised the caller for who she actually was, and that his answer did not relate to her, but to some other schoolgirl.

126The value of the evidence to the prosecution case thus cannot be definitively assessed. That value depends entirely upon the interpretation that jury puts upon the evidence - that is, the inferences they draw from what the respondent said, in the context of the whole of the prosecution case. The task of this Court, under s 5F(3A), is to assume an interpretation most favourable to the prosecution - that is, that the respondent acknowledged having had some sexual engagement with the complainant. Having regard to the specific evidence of the period during which he had contact with the family, that would include fixing the time of the conduct he acknowledged within the timeframe of the indictment. If the jury were to draw the inference most favourable to the prosecution, and interpret the conversation as an acknowledgment of sexual contact with the complainant, the evidence is of considerable ""cogency or force"" (Shamouil, [77]).

127Moreover, this is a case in which the only direct evidence of the offences is that of the complainant. In R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19, it was held:

""In all cases of serious crime it is customary for judges to stress that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of the crime, the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care before a conclusion is arrived at that a verdict of guilty should be brought in; but a direction of that kind does not of itself imply that the witness' evidence is unreliable.""

A direction in such terms became standard in cases such as the present, in which only one witness is able to give direct evidence of the events in question. 

128Whether that remains a required or even correct direction may now be in some doubt. By s 294AA of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (introduced by the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual and Other Offences) Act 2006 (No 88)), commencing 1 January 2007: 

""(1) A judge in any proceedings to which this Division applies must not warn a jury, or make any suggestion to a jury, that complainants as a class are unreliable witnesses. 
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), that subsection prohibits a warning to a jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of any complainant. 
(3) Sections 164 and 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 are subject to this section.""

The section appears in Div 1 of Pt 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which applies to proceedings in respect of prescribed sexual assault offences, of which offences against s 61J and s 61L are instances. 

129The Murray direction is/was not limited to cases involving allegations of sexual offence. It was of general application.

130Whether s 294AA impinges upon the application of Murray in sexual offence cases remains to be seen. To the best of my knowledge, that question has not been considered by this Court. It is arguable that a Murray direction is not ""a warning to a jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of any complainant"" prohibited by sub-s (2), and is therefore still applicable. On the other hand, when introducing the legislation into Parliament, the Minister for Gaming and Racing, and Minister for the Central Coast, representing the Attorney General, said:

""The direction in Regina v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 543 provides that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of the offence, the evidence of the witness is to be scrutinised with great care. The typical sexual assault offence takes place in private without any other witnesses. The members of the task force agreed that the direction was unnecessary, as existing directions as to reasonable doubt were sufficient to protect the accused."" (NSW Parliamentary Debates, Legislative Assembly, 18 October 2006, 2958) 

131The relevance of the above is that it may be that the jury in the present case will be directed in terms of Murray - that is, by having their attention drawn to the fact that the evidence of the complainant is the only direct evidence against the respondent, and by being invited to scrutinise her evidence with care.

132If that is the case, evidence of an acknowledgment by the respondent, if the respondent's response to the complainant is so interpreted, would go a significant way to supporting the complainant's evidence. That in itself gives it ""cogency or force"". Exclusion of the evidence would substantially weaken the prosecution case. 

133In my opinion, the evidence meets the test stated in s 5F(3A). This Court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. 

The proceedings in the District Court

134The trial judge was invited to exclude the evidence on three bases: those provided by the Evidence Act 1995, s 85, s 90, and s 137. She rejected the respondent's contentions in respect of s 85, holding that that section had no application. She held, however, that both s 90 and s 137 operated so as to justify the exclusion of the evidence.

135Section 90 provides as follows:

""90 Discretion to exclude admissions 
In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 
(a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and 
(b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.""

Section 137 is in the following terms:

""137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings
In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.""

136Before coming to an analysis of the trial judge's reasoning to the exclusion of the evidence, it is appropriate to make the following observations. The argument took place on the day fixed for the commencement of the trial. It is recorded in 30 pages of transcript. Some evidence in the voir dire was taken.

137Her Honour delivered her judgment at the commencement of business the following morning. It is plain that the judgment was prepared in some haste and under some pressure. Indeed, at an early stage of giving her reasons, her Honour noted that her remarks were intended to be as short as possible, and offered, if required, more complete reasons at a later time. As is so often the case in such circumstances, the reasons are perhaps not as ordered or as clearly laid out as might otherwise have been the case.

138Section 90 is predicated upon the evidence in question being tendered as an admission (and that it can properly be so categorised). The section involves the exercise of a judgment concerning the unfairness (or otherwise) of the admission of the evidence, having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made. Here, as I have said in relation to the jurisdictional issue, the evidence is tendered as an admission, and is capable of being so categorised. For the purposes of the present appeal, it should be treated as constituting an admission by the respondent.

139Section 137 also calls for a judgment. That judgment is the evaluation of the probative value of the evidence relative to the danger it could cause of unfair prejudice. 

140In respect of each provision, the trial judge undertook the necessary exercise. In my opinion, each determination is to be reviewed by this Court on principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499: see the discussion on a closely related issue in DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568. Although, with respect to s 90, that very question was touched upon in EM v The Queen [2007] HCA 46; 232 CLR 67 at [55], the High Court found it unnecessary to decide that question.

141In substance, the Director's arguments can be stated as follows:


in respect of the decision to exclude the evidence under s 90, the trial judge's findings of fact, in a number of respects, cannot be sustained;


in respect of the decision to exclude the evidence under s 137, her Honour impermissibly took into account questions of credibility, reliability and weight, in contravention of the principle stated, inter alia, in Shamouil. Consideration of this latter contention inevitably raises the conflict between that decision and the Victorian decision in Dupas. 

The trial judge's reasons

142Her Honour briefly outlined the relevant evidence. She quickly disposed of the s 85 argument, and turned, concurrently, to the s 90 and s 137 arguments. Although she was aware that each required separate consideration, she appears to have treated the factual basis relevant to each as coextensive with the factual basis relevant to the other. Since each section involves a consideration of possible unfairness, that is an understandable approach. Her Honour began by referring to the decision of this Court in Pavitt v R [2007] NSWCCA 88, 169 A Crim R 452, per McColl JA and Latham J, in which are stated a number of propositions relevant to the admission of covertly recorded conversations. 

143The core of each decision is that, in all of the circumstances, the ""admission"" was unreliable. The trial judge accepted that, in making the telephone call to the respondent, the complainant was acting as ""an agent of the State"". In this context, ""agent of the State"" derives from the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R v Broyles [1991] 3 SCR 595, a concept adopted by the High Court in The Queen v Swaffield; Pavic v The Queen [1998] HCA 1; 192 CLR 159, and which found its way into the propositions stated by McColl JA and Latham J in Pavitt. However, the trial judge found that that fact was not determinative, and that questions of unfairness to the respondent in the admission of the evidence remained relevant. She then referred to the answer in the conversation in which the respondent said ""Yeah, fuckin oath and I wouldn't mind doing it again ... ha ha"" and noted that the prosecution relied upon that as an admission. She then said:

""However, as submitted by the defence, the circumstances of the conversation may have adversely affected the truth of that response and, therefore, make the admission of the evidence unfair. [Counsel for the respondent] submits that when a person has allegedly adopted a proposition as the Crown asserts here the Court must consider whether or not the proposition was properly established by the conversation that occurred prior to that.""

I take this to mean that the question asked by the complainant to which the respondent gave the answer was non-specific, and contained no explicit allegation to which the respondent could properly reply.

144The trial judge nevertheless appears to have accepted that the respondent's answer to the complainant's ""question"" could reasonably be interpreted as an admission. Her focus, as I read her judgment, was principally upon doubt about its reliability or truthfulness. Ultimately, she declared herself not satisfied that the respondent was ""fully aware"" of the identity of the caller in the first conversation, in which the admission was made. She reached this position because:

(i) the evidence indicated that there had been no contact between the complainant and the respondent between 2002, when the complainant was eight years of age, and 2011, when she was 17 years of age, and that human experience showed that it was unlikely that the voice of an eight year old would sound like that of a 17 year old (I take this to mean that her Honour found it doubtful that the respondent would have recognised the voice of the complainant);

(ii) that the tape recording made it clear that there was considerable background noise, and that the respondent was distracted by speaking to others during the course of the conversation with the complainant;

(iii) that the ""accusation"" made by the complainant was vague, and failed to identify with any specificity the conduct of which she was accusing the respondent, and that (at that point) the complainant failed to state her age at the time of the events or the conduct which she was alleging against the respondent;

(iv) that in the conversation the respondent appeared to believe that he was speaking to somebody with whom he had had an association (impliedly sexual) at the time when the other party to the association was a student at Blacktown Girls' High School; that the respondent appeared to be ""perplexed"", but did not concede any engagement with an eight year old at the time he knew her or had anything to do with her.

145The trial judge therefore concluded that the reliability of the ""admission"" was adversely affected, to such a degree that it would be unfair to permit it to be used in evidence. In reaching this conclusion, she specifically rejected a prosecution submission to the effect that the respondent's reference to a ""burgundy jacket"" as part of a school uniform of the person to whom he believed he was speaking dovetailed or interlocked neatly with the evidence that, as a primary school student, the complainant wore a ""maroon jumper"", thereby giving rise to an inference that the respondent was aware of the identity of the caller.

146Her Honour appears also to have accepted and taken into account, in the rejection of the evidence, a further defence submission that, should the evidence be admitted, the respondent would be forced to give evidence at the trial to explain his answer, thus being ""compelled to abandon his right to silence"". 

147The Director takes issue with what is described as ""the finding of fact"" - that is, that the trial judge was not satisfied that the respondent knew the identity of the caller at the time he made the admission, which was at an early stage of the conversation. In effect, the Director submitted that it was not open to the trial judge not to be so satisfied. That is a very difficult proposition to establish - it entails the further proposition that the evidence that the respondent knew to whom he was speaking was so overwhelming that no other conclusion was reasonably open.

148I do not think that it was either necessary or appropriate for the trial judge to make a finding either way. It was not necessary, for the evidence to be admitted, that the prosecution establish that the respondent was aware of the identity of the caller. That was ultimately a question for the jury. The reliability of the admission was, however, relevant to the exercise required by s 90, and the facts relied on by the trial judge were material to that consideration.

Evidence Act, s 90

149The approach to be taken in the application of s 90 was considered by the High Court in EM. Gleeson CJ and Heydon J said;

""56 The language in s 90 is so general that it would not be possible in any particular case to mark out the full extent of its meaning ... In any particular case, the application of s 90 is likely to be highly fact-specific ...""

That was a case in which the unfairness was said to lie in assumptions made by the alleged offender about the use that would be made of anything he said to police officers, and I have omitted from the extract passages specifically relevant to that issue.

150Gleeson CJ and Heydon J accepted that unreliability is an important aspect of the unfairness discretion but added a reference to Swaffield in which it was made plain that unreliability is not the exclusive determining factor (Swaffield at [78]). Gummow and Hayne JJ agreed that questions of reliability play an important part in the exercise of the common law discretion to exclude confessional evidence in circumstances of alleged of unfairness (at [110]-[111]) (and, by implication, to the exercise of the s 90 discretion).

151At [107], their Honours said:

""... the focus of s 90 falls upon the fairness of using the evidence at trial, not directly upon characterising the circumstances in which the admissions were made, including the means by which the admissions were elicited, as 'fair' or 'unfair'.""

At [115] their Honours identified the question presented by s 90 as:

""why did these circumstances make the use at his trial of the evidence of what he had said unfair?""

That is the question that must here be answered. That is not the question that was grappled with by the trial judge.

152I have concluded that there was error, in the House sense, in the approach taken by the trial judge. The error is that she went beyond considering questions of reliability (in the EM sense) and embarked upon a consideration of what motivated the respondent to give the answer that he did, and more importantly, what he intended to convey - for example, she said:

""He appears to believe that he is speaking to somebody with whom he has had some sort of association, and impliedly a sexual one, at the time that she was a high school student at Blacktown High ...""

That is a question to be determined by the jury.

153I accept, as I have above, that different interpretations may be placed upon the respondent's answer to the complainant. I accept that an argument is available to him (whether or not he gives evidence) that it has not been conclusively or even persuasively shown that, when he gave that answer, he knew that the person to whom he was speaking was the complainant. (I accept also that there are persuasive arguments to the contrary.) I accept that the answer cannot be construed as a confession to any of the individual allegations made by the complainant that have been translated into the individual counts on the indictment. I accept that the admission of the evidence might put the respondent in a position of needing to make a forensic decision about giving evidence or not giving evidence. 

154I do not accept that this last is a relevant consideration. That a person might, by reason of the admission of contested evidence, consider himself or herself forced to give evidence in a criminal trial is not, ordinarily, a relevant consideration in the determination of the admissibility of the evidence. It cannot be said that evidence is unfairly prejudicial merely because it is of such potency or force that it calls for an answer by the accused person. The objective of Crown evidence in a criminal trial is to call for an answer, if an answer is available.

155True it is, that in Cook, I held that s 137 ought to be exercised in favour of that appellant, in circumstances in which the contested evidence (which was evidence of flight from the police, tendered as showing that he acted out of a consciousness of guilt) could have forced him to give an explanation. That was not because that appellant considered himself forced into the witness box, and was therefore denied his right to silence. It was because the only explanation he could give in respect of the flight evidence would have exposed him as having a history of the very kind of offence with which he stood charged. It was nothing to do with the abrogation of the right to silence.

156Acceptance of the propositions I have set out above does not dictate a conclusion that the evidence is unreliable. And, as Gleeson CJ and Heydon J said in EM, reliability is not the only consideration. Also relevant is that, should the evidence be admitted, the jury will undoubtedly have the benefit of argument from both parties as to what they should make of it, what interpretation they should place upon what the respondent said, and will also have the benefit of detailed directions from the trial judge as to the relevant alternatives.

157I agree with Basten JA that the evidence is admissible, and that there is nothing in the circumstances in which it was made that renders its admission unfair. The trial judge was in error in relying on s 90 to exclude it. 

Evidence Act, s 137

158As I have set out above, it is plain that the trial judge took into account the reliability of the alleged admission by the respondent in her consideration of the objection based upon s 137.

159Whether that was an error calls for consideration of the competing views of this Court (Shamouil, Cook, Mundine, Sood) and the Court of Appeal of Victoria (Dupas). A preliminary question is that explored in some depth by Basten JA at [23]-[40]. I agree with his Honour's conclusion at [40] that this Court should determine for itself the correct approach to the application of s 137, paying due regard to the expressed views of the Victorian Court of Appeal. 

160What this Court said Shamouil was:

""60 The preponderant body of authority in this Court is in favour of a restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility are to be taken into account in determining the probative value of evidence for purposes of determining questions of admissibility. There is no reason to change that approach.

...

64 To adopt any other approach would be to usurp for a trial judge critical aspects of the traditional role of a jury. In the case of evidence of critical significance, such a ruling by a trial judge would, in substance, be equivalent to directing a verdict of acquittal on the basis that the trial judge was of the view that a verdict of guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. As the High Court said in that different, but not irrelevant, context in Doney v The Queen [[1990] HCA 51] 171 CLR 207 at 275, this is not a permissible 'basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function'. In my opinion, the same is true if a trial judge can determine the weight of evidence when applying s 137.""

161What the Victorian Court of Appeal said in Dupas was encapsulated in para [63], set out below:

""63 For the following reasons, we are compelled to the view that Shamouil and the other decisions that have applied it are manifestly wrong and should not be followed. We are compelled to the conclusion that we should depart from the reasoning and conclusion in Shamouil as error can be demonstrated with a degree of clarity by the application of the correct legal analysis ... Our conclusions are as follows: 

(a) The common law did require the trial judge, in assessing probative value, to evaluate the weight that the jury could rationally attach to the evidence. The contrary conclusion was inconsistent with a continuous line of High Court authority.

(b) The legislative intention, as disclosed by the language of s 137 and its context, is that the task under s 137 is the same as that at common law.

(c) The trial judge undertaking the balancing task is only obliged to assume that the jury will accept the evidence to be truthful but is not required to make an assumption that its reliability will be accepted. The phrase 'taken at its highest' is more appropriately used in considering a no case submission, when the judge must accept that the jury may find the evidence credible and reliable.

(d) In order to determine the capacity of the evidence rationally to affect the determination of a fact in issue, the judge is required to make some assessment of the weight that the jury could, acting reasonably, give to that evidence. Where it is contended that the quality or frailties of the evidence would result in the jury attaching more weight to the evidence than it deserved, the trial judge is obliged to assess the extent of the risk. That does not require the trial judge to anticipate the weight that the jury would or will attach to it. The judge is obliged to assess what probative value the jury could assign to the evidence, against which must be balanced the risk that the jury will give the evidence disproportionate weight.

(e) So to construe s 137 accords with the language of the statute and its context. To construe it otherwise does not.

(f) Such a construction does not involve any enlargement of the powers of a trial judge or any encroachment upon the traditional jury function."" (italics in original, bold added)

162I state at the outset that, having given careful consideration to the reasoning of the Victorian Court of Appeal, I adhere to the views I have previously expressed in Cook and Mundine and my concurrence with those of Spigelman CJ in Shamouil.

163There are two evaluations that constitute the s 137 exercise - the assessment of the probative value of the evidence in question, and the assessment of its potential prejudicial effect. A judge asked to exclude evidence pursuant s 137 is necessarily asked to do so at a time before the evidence in the trial is complete. As a matter of practice, increasingly frequently (by reason of trial efficiency, and minimisation of jury inconvenience) this is done prior to the empanelling of the jury. Ordinarily, in this State at least, the assessments of probative value and prejudicial effect are made on the basis of documentary material - principally, the statements of witnesses. For the purposes of the evaluation, the assumption is made that the evidence will be accepted as accurate. 

164In R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308 I said (with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL);

36 A decision to admit or reject evidence tendered under s 97(1) [of the Evidence Act] must, obviously, be a decision based upon the information and material available to the judge at the time the decision is made. It is a decision involving 'a degree and value judgment' ...""

That proposition applies equally in respect of the consideration of rejection of evidence on the basis provided by s 137. 

165Section 137 is one of a number of provisions in the Evidence Act in which the question of admissibility of evidence is contingent upon an assessment by the trial judge of its probative value, sometimes in conjunction with, or balanced against, some other specified consideration. ""Probative value"" is defined in the Dictionary as:

""... the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.""

166Other sections requiring assessment of probative value, in the context of questions of admissibility include:


s 97 (tendency evidence); 
s 98 (coincidence evidence) (in respect of each of which admission depends upon the evidence being shown to have ""significant probative value""); 
s 101 (for the purposes of criminal cases, imposing a further restriction on the use of tendency or coincidence evidence, such that the probative value must be shown ""substantially"" to outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant); 
s 103 (permitting, as an exception to the credibility rule (see s 102), cross-examination relevant only to a witness' credibility where the evidence is shown to have ""substantial probative value""); 
s 135 (conferring a discretion to refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is ""substantially outweighed"" by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial to a party, misleading or confusing, or cause or result in undue waste of time); 
s 138(3) (conferring a discretion to exclude improperly or illegally obtained evidence - one specified consideration in the exercise of the discretion is the probative value of the evidence).

Except for s 101 and s 137, each of which applies only in criminal proceedings, all provisions are of general application. It is of some interest and significance that s 97 and s 98 require the assessment of ""significant probative value"" to be made in the context of the evidence already adduced, and evidence anticipated to be adduced, by the party seeking to adduce the tendency or coincidence evidence. For myself, I do not see that requirement as involving the trial judge in weighing the relative merits of competing explanations for the conduct the subject of the tendency or coincidence evidence: see DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 215 A Crim R 349 at [10], [78]-[82].

167The actual probative value to be assigned to any individual item of evidence lies in the province of the tribunal of fact - in most criminal trials, the jury. It is not ordinarily possible to determine the actual probative value of any piece of evidence until the evidence in the proceeding is complete and the full picture can be seen. ""Probative value"" in the sections mentioned is plainly not used in that sense. It is used in the sense of the potential of the evidence to have the relevant quality. Where an assessment of probative value is a prerequisite to a decision to admit or not admit any particular item of evidence, the exercise for the trial judge is necessarily ""predictive and evaluative"" (Fletcher, at [35]). The prediction is of what use the jury could rationally make of the evidence, in the context of the trial evidence in its complete form. The evaluation is of the importance or significance of the evidence in the same context. 

168The terms ""credibility"", ""reliability"" and ""weight"" have largely been used as though interchangeable. Although it is possible to discern differences in what is imported by these terms, I will, for present purposes, proceed on the basis that they convey essentially the same concept.

169Determination of the credibility of evidence will often depend upon the assessment of the witness who gives the evidence. Determination of reliability will often depend upon some analysis of the circumstances surrounding the coming into existence of the evidence.

170Determination of the weight to be given to any item of evidence will depend, not only on where that evidence fits in the overall mosaic of the evidence in the trial, but, in many cases, upon an assessment of a witness after cross-examination. It may also depend upon an assessment of the evidence of one witness against the evidence of another (or others). That is not something that can readily be undertaken at a pre-trial or interlocutory stage.

171Nor is it appropriate that the exercise be partially undertaken - as the Victorian Court of Appeal appears to envisage in [63](d), where it said that the judge is required:

""... to make some assessment of the weight that the jury could, acting reasonably give to that evidence."" (bold added)

None of the sections that call for assessment of the probative value as a precondition to admissibility give any indication that some exploration of credibility, reliability or weight ought to be conducted, or, if so, what limits are imposed on the extent of that exploration. To embark upon a partial assessment of weight could, in my opinion, be potentially productive of real injustice. No boundaries with respect to the extent to which the weight of the evidence is to be explored are discernible in any of the provisions that call for evaluation of probative value. 

172I appreciate that the construction of a statute will not ordinarily be dictated by the fact that it might have unwanted, or even undesirable, practical consequences. At least that is so where the language of the statute is clear, or where the intention of the legislature can be discerned with relative confidence. Even where it is not, unwanted practical consequences have a limited role to play.

173Here, there is nothing obvious in the language of the statute that suggests that probative value, at the admission stage, is to be determined by reference to the weight to be assigned to the evidence. That much is clear by the reasoning in Dupas - the Victorian Court of Appeal reached its conclusion by examination of historical precepts, not the language of s 137. 

174The nature of the practical consequences of that interpretation is useful as a guide in answering the question whether the construction reflects the intention of the drafters of the legislation. That, in my opinion, is a further pointer to the position taken by this Court in Shamouil, in preference to that taken in Dupas. 

175For these reasons, in addition to those given by Spigelman CJ in Shamouil, I maintain the view that questions of credibility, reliability and weight play no part in the assessment of probative value with respect to s 137. Although it does not call for present determination, it seems to me that the same must apply in all cases where admissibility depends upon such an assessment.

176Since it is quite clear that the trial judge did take into account such issues in the s 137 decision, error in the House sense has been demonstrated. This Court should intervene. 

177Moreover, because of the approach taken by the trial judge, she made no assessment of the probative value of the evidence (on the assumption that the jury drew the inferences that will be urged by the prosecution) nor of the potential unfair prejudicial effect, having regard to appropriate available ameliorative directions. 

178In my opinion, the evidence is admissible. What is to be made of it is a matter for the jury, when fully instructed. 

179Accordingly, I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA.

180BLANCH J: The Crown appeals pursuant to the provisions of s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 from a ruling of the District Court at Parramatta on 6 November 2012.

181The respondent appeared for trial charged with five counts of indecently assaulting a child under the age of 10 years and one count of aggravated sexual assault. The offences are alleged to have occurred in 2002 when the complainant was eight years old. The respondent was a family friend who visited the family during 2002. Thereafter the family left the area.

182In 2011 the complainant made a complaint to the police who obtained a warrant and arranged for the complainant to have two telephone conversations with the respondent on 25 August 2011. These conversations were recorded.

183The trial judge excluded the evidence of those two telephone conversations pursuant to ss 90 and 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. It is that ruling the Crown appeals against asserting the ruling was wrong and that pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act the ruling substantially weakens the prosecution's case.

184The two conversations are as follows:

185In my view the conversations were highly prejudicial to the respondent and unfairly so. In the first conversation the exchange:

Question ""Yeah do you remember what you used to do to me""

Answer ""Yeah fuckin oath and I wouldn't mind doing it again haha""

indicates the character of the respondent as someone prepared to engage in opportunistic casual sexual encounters. The subsequent part of that conversation indicates the respondent's interest in a girl he remembers at high school. In the state of NSW the usual age for such girls is between 12 and 18 and the relevant age of consent is 16.

186The topic of sexual activity with under age children is highly emotive in the community and for the respondent to portray himself as promiscuous and interested in high school age children could only have the effect of seriously damaging his character in the eyes of a jury. 

187In Attwood v The Queen [1960] HCA 15; 102 CLR 353 at 359 the High Court in a joint judgment of Dixon CJ, McTiernan J, Fullagher J, Taylor J and Menzies J said as to evidence of bad character:

""It is not excluded as irrelevant to proof of guilt. It is excluded as a matter of policy, policy deeply rooted in principle. 'The evidence is relevant to the issue, but is excluded for reasons of policy and humanity; because, although by admitting it you might arrive at justice in one case out of a hundred, you would probably do injustice in the other ninety nine. Willes J (1865) Le Co at p541' "" 

188Exceptions to this principle such as the admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence are strictly governed by the provisions of ss 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act and prior to the inception of that Act by the common law. There is no claim that the evidence should be admitted here as falling into any such exception.

189Section 137 of the Evidence Act is mandatory in its terms. It states:

""In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.""

In consequence the trial judge was bound to evaluate both the unfair prejudice and the probative value of the evidence in issue. 

190The commentary in paragraph 957 of the Australian Law Reform Commission, Evidence (Interim) Report No. 26 (1984) introducing the Evidence Act makes it clear the discretion is the common law discretion and points out that ""prejudice"" ... means ""damage to the accused's case in some unacceptable way, by provoking some irrational, emotional response, or giving evidence more weight than it should have."" 

191In Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593 at [51] McHugh J said:

""But the weakness of relevant evidence is not a ground for its exclusion. It is only when the probative value of evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect that the Crown can be deprived of the use of relevant but weak evidence. And evidence is not prejudicial merely because it strengthens the prosecution case. It is prejudicial only when the jury are likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserves or when the nature or content of the evidence may inflame the jury or divert the jurors from their task.""

192Evidence is not admitted unless it is relevant. Once admitted the evidence is probative of the guilt of an accused. Of necessity that means the evidence is prejudicial. It is only where the evidence is unfairly prejudicial that the discretion to exclude it arises. In deciding that issue it is necessary for the trial judge to weigh the probative value of the evidence against its unfair prejudice to the accused. In doing that the judge must take into account any directions that could be given to minimise the prejudice created (R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [37] per Simpson J).

193In the instant case, in the emotionally charged atmosphere of a child sexual assault trial, evidence disclosing the respondent's promiscuity and interest in high school girls would create a highly significant and unfair prejudice to the respondent. It introduces a real danger of the jury using tendency reasoning to arrive at a verdict. 

194In performing the balancing exercise between unfair prejudice and probative value the courts in this state have been guided by the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Regina v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228. He quoted with approval the statement of Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Newman and Ireland JJ agreed) in R v Carusi (1997) 92 A Crim R 52 at 65-66 where it was said:

""The trial judge can only exclude the evidence of such a witness where, taken at its highest, its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect;""

195He referred to other authorities to the contrary including Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 and said at [60]-[61]:

""The preponderant body of authority in this Court is in favour of a restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility are to be taken into account in determining the probative value of evidence for purposes of determining questions of admissibility. There is no reason to change that approach.

In my opinion, the critical word in this regard is the word could in the definition of probative value as set out above, namely ""the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment ..."". The focus on capability draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude. It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude. Evidence has ""probative value"", as defined, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty.""

196He also observed at [71]:

""Like other sections of the Evidence Act, s 137 calls upon a judge to compare essentially incommensurable considerations: probative value on the one hand and unfair prejudice on the other. As Justice Scalia once put it, this is like asking ""whether a particular line is longer than a particular rock is heavy. (Bendix Autolite Corp v Midwesco Enterprises Inc, 486 US 888 (1988) at 897)"". Nevertheless, this is a task that judges are often called upon to perform.""

197He emphasised it was not desirable for the Court to undertake an investigation into the weight of evidence based on credibility or reliability because to do so would be to usurp the function of the jury.

198It is to be noted that in the present case the evidence sought to be tendered does not give rise to any question of credibility or reliability. The evidence is known and can be evaluated. 

199It was held in R v Suman Sood [2007] NSWCCA 214 at [40] per Latham J:

""... it was no part of the trial judge's function in assessing probative value under s 137 to have regard to competing explanations for the respondent's conduct, other than that upon which the Crown relied, even assuming that an alternative explanation was given by the respondent on the voir dire.""

200In that case the Health Insurance Commission executed a search warrant on Dr Sood to investigate fraud. When the authorities eventually got to see Dr Sood they found cash receipt books and receipts discarded in waste bins. The Crown asserted this was done by Dr Sood because of her consciousness of guilt. Evidence was given by Dr Sood and she denied disposing of the books. After hearing considerable evidence on the matter it was obvious a real issue of credibility arose and in those circumstances for the judge to decide the issue was a clear usurping of the function of the jury and so the Court held. It is this credibility issue to which the passage quoted refers.

201In assessing the probative value of evidence in DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9 Bathurst CJ said at [10]:

""However, as Whealy JA has pointed out (at [78]-[81]), the trial judge in forming a view as to whether the evidence has significant probative value must consider by reference to the evidence itself or other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party tendering it, whether there is a real possibility of an alternate explanation inconsistent with (in this case) the guilt of the party against whom it is tendered.""

(Allsop P agreed with that comment at [11]).

202At [78] Whealy JA said:

""... the trial Judge must ask whether the possibility of such an alternative explanation substantially alters his (or her) view as to the significant capacity of the Crown evidence, if accepted, to establish the fact in issue. Does the alternative possibility, in the Judge's view, rob the evidence of its otherwise cogent capacity to prove the Crown's case? If it does not, the trial judge may safely conclude that the evidence has significant probative value.""

203The judgment of Whealy JA was endorsed by Bathurst CJ, Allsop P, McClellan CJ at CJ and McCallum J.

204The alternative explanation or explanations must amount to a ""real possibility"" or be such as to ""rob the evidence of its otherwise cogent capacity"". The case of R v SJRC [2007] NSWCCA 142 was a case where this Court held the impugned evidence was not robbed of its cogency and force. In that case the accused sent two text messages the day after an alleged sexual assault apologising for his behaviour. The content of those text messages very strongly supported the complainant's account of what happened and so the Court held. The same cannot be said in this case. 

205In my view the contention by the Crown that the comments made by the respondent in the conversations under review amount to a confession is open to question. There are other interpretations open including that he was not aware of the real identity of the complainant.

206The trial judge correctly noted the respondent could not be expected to recognise the voice of the complainant after nine years and when she had grown up in the intervening time. She noted that the background noise in the call and the respondent's early responses indicated a degree of confusion at the respondent's end of the call. She also noted the lack of clarity in what is said to be a confession. She also noted his positive denial when he understood her claim related to a time when she was eight years old.

207Those matters are all relevant for the judge to consider when assessing the capacity of the evidence to establish the fact in issue. What must be done then is to weigh that capacity against the unfair prejudice. In this case when I do that I find the capacity of the evidence to prove guilt is compromised because of the competing inferences open when interpreting the conversations and the unfair prejudice is highly significant. It is evidence that may inflame the jury or divert the jurors from their task. Furthermore, such prejudice could not be corrected by directions to the jury and it outweighs the probative value of the evidence. 

208In my view the trial judge was correct in rejecting the evidence and accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. 

209PRICE J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL and Blanch J that the appeal should be dismissed, but wish to express my reasons for that agreement.

210Section 5F (3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is as follows: 

""(3A) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case.""

211The Court does not have jurisdiction unless the Crown discharges the onus of establishing that the exclusion of the two telephone conversations by the trial judge substantially weakens its case. 

212The two telephone conversations that were excluded are comprehensively contained in [184] in Blanch J's judgment. The Crown places particular reliance on the following exchange between the complainant and the respondent in the first conversation:

""[complainant] Yeah do you remember what you used to do to me

[respondent] Yeah fuckin oath and I wouldn't mind doing it again ... haha.""

213The Crown contends that the conversation, taken at its highest is an admission by the respondent of sexual misconduct with the complainant and without that evidence the prosecution case essentially relies upon the evidence of the complainant alone. The Crown says that its case depends on the jury forming a favourable view of the credibility of the complainant. The Crown argues that the exclusion of the evidence leaves the complainant to be assessed by the jury without any significant supporting evidence, in circumstances where the complainant has come forward years after the alleged offence. As a result, the prosecution case has been substantially weakened. 

214The respondent submits that the evidence excluded by the trial judge is of such low ""probative value"" that its exclusion will not ""substantially"" weaken the prosecution case. 

215This Court's task is to determine whether the trial judge's rejection of the telephone calls not ""weakens"" but ""substantially weakens"" the prosecution case by asking whether or not that would be the effect ""on the assumption that the jury accepted the evidence."" The prosecution case is to be considered as a whole and questions of weight are irrelevant: R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 at [39] - [40]. 

216The content of the conversations does not disclose an express admission of sexual impropriety by the respondent but the Crown's argument is that an inference can be drawn that the respondent made a ""general admission"" of sexual misconduct with the complainant. The drawing of inferences requires more than optimistic leaps of instinct or imagination, it requires the ability to reason from facts admitted or proved. The obligation to assess the conversation at its highest does not mean, in my opinion, that the context in which the respondent said ""...I wouldn't mind doing it again"" is to be ignored. An examination of the first recorded conversation is required in order to ascertain the inference that the evidence itself is capable of supporting.

217In the first recorded conversation, the exchange between the complainant and the respondent included the following:

""[respondent] When did this happen anyway

[complainant] When I was eight years old you just admitted it 

[respondent] Eight years old

[complainant] Yes I was eight years old at the time 

[respondent] Eight years old 

[complainant] Remember you used to tell me I was bad and I was the bad one but now I'm older now I know that you're the bad one

[respondent] when you were in high school man not not eight years old 

[complainant] I was eight years old."" 

218Accepting that for the purpose of s 5F(3A), regard is not to be had to competing explanations for the words that are said to be an admission, the highest inference the evidence is capable of supporting is that the respondent acknowledged he had engaged in sexual misconduct with the complainant when she was in high school. It is not a general admission of sexual misconduct with her.

219All of the charges upon which the respondent is to be tried are alleged to have occurred when the complainant was eight years old. I do not consider that if the jury drew this inference that the probative value of the evidence would be significant. 

220I do not think that the Crown's contention that the respondent made a general admission of sexual misconduct is enhanced by the respondent's statement in the first recorded conversation; ""I remember you from high school, remember when you were wearing the maroon jackets and that and went to high school"". Although the Crown proposes to adduce evidence that the complainant's primary school uniform included burgundy shorts and a burgundy jumper, the respondent made it very clear in all of his conversation that whatever he meant by ""...I wouldn't mind doing it again"" was confined in his mind to when the person with whom he was speaking was in high school. 

221I do not agree with the Crown's submission that the complainant's evidence is left without significant support by the exclusion of the recorded conversations. The complainant's evidence is supported by that of her mother who recalls regular visits by the respondent to the family home, an occasion when the respondent took her daughter out in his car and the complaint made by her daughter, who was then 14 years old, that the respondent had molested her. Furthermore, the complainant's recollection of noticing a mole or a sore on the top of the respondent's penis is supported by the police photographs that reveal a small red lesion on the head of the penis. Although the medical practitioner is unable to express an opinion as to whether the lesion may have been present in 2002, a jury, when considering the evidence in combination, could well consider that the presence in 2012 of a lesion that is consistent with the complainant's recollection to be an egregious coincidence. There is also the evidence of KL (junior) who recalls the complainant crying but did not remember exactly what the complainant told her but she knew that the complainant was hurt and something bad had happened. 

222In my view, the Crown's challenge to the trial judge's decision fails to clear the first hurdle. The Crown has not discharged the onus of establishing that its case has been substantially weakened. 

223As to s 137 Evidence Act 1995, I agree with Blanch J's identification at [185], [186] and [193] of the unfair prejudice that might arise to the complainant from the admission of the conversations. To my mind, it is unnecessary to consider questions of competing explanations as the evidence viewed at its highest is weak and is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the respondent, which could not be corrected by jury directions. The exclusionary power in s 137 mandated the rejection of the evidence. 

224Whilst upon my analysis, it is unnecessary to consider the conflict in the approaches to be taken to s 137 Evidence Act since the decision in Dupas v The Queen [2012] VSCA 328, it seems to me that enabling the trial judge to consider questions of credibility, reliability or weight when s 137 is invoked, is likely to enhance the fundamental principle that an accused is to receive a fair trial. Although Simpson J at [163], [170]-[171] refers to the practical difficulties that may arise by adopting such an approach, it is not uncommon for a witness to be cross-examined during a voir dire and an assessment can be made by the trial judge of the actual probative value of the evidence. More often than not, the probative value of evidence may be assessed from the witness statements without the necessity of calling witnesses. 

225In my opinion, the approach taken in Dupas does much to avoid evidence being before a jury which in reality (rather than being taken at its highest in favour of the Crown) has little probative value and is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.

226For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

		14 February 2014",2013-05-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761547,"Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115","Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: Mr Mohammad Abbas pleaded guilty to two counts of knowingly taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, Methylamphetamine, contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The amount of the drug the subject of Count 1 was 500 grams, whilst in respect of Count 2 it was 372 grams. 

2In respect of Count 1 the sentencing judge was asked to take into account four other offences pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999 (""the Sentencing Act""), which were set out on a Form 1. These offences in respect of which the applicant, Abbas, had been charged but not convicted were as follows:

""1. H36754416/2 Between about 11 and 12 May 2008 at Auburn NSW did knowingly take part in the supply of the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (284 g). (Section 25 (2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985)

2. H36754416/3 Between about 11 and 12 May 2008 at Auburn, NSW did knowingly take part in the supply of the commercial quantity of 3,4 methylendioxymethamphetamine (400g). (Section 25 (2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985)

3. H36754416/7 On 31 May 2008 at Auburn, NSW did participate in a criminal group knowing that his participation contributed to criminal activity. (Section 93T(1) Crimes Act 1900)

4. H38175717/1 Between 30 and 31 May 2008 at Holbrook, NSW did agree to supply 56g cocaine (56g) (Section 25 (1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985)""

3The offences the subject of Counts 1 and 2 carried a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment. The first two matters on the Form 1 carried a similar maximum penalty. The third matter carried a maximum penalty of 5 years' imprisonment. The fourth matter carried a maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment.

4Abbas was sentenced on Count 1, in respect of which the Form 1 offences were taken into account, to imprisonment for 7 years to commence on 26 December 2011 and to expire on 25 December 2018, with a non-parole period of 4 years to expire on 25 December 2015. In relation to Count 2, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months commencing on 26 December 2010 and expiring on 25 June 2015, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months to expire on 25 June 2013.

5Abbas relied on three grounds of appeal:

""1. His Honour erred in increasing the sentence in respect of count 1, in order to reflect the additional criminality of the Form 1 offences.

2. The Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in the light of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender, Con Bodiotis.

3. The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.""

Ground 1

6In relation to the Form 1 offences the sentencing judge made the following remarks:

""The proper treatment of Form 1 matters was considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the guideline judgment in Attorney General's Application Number 1/2002 (2002) NSWLR 147.

The fact that there are matters to be taken into account on the Form 1 means that in an appropriate case, greater weight should be given to the need for personal deterrence and the community's entitlement to extract retribution. The point of the process may be to impose a longer sentence or to alter the nature of the sentence that would be imposed if the primary sentence stood alone.

Here the criminality in the matters on the form one is substantial. The offender acted as a conduit between the supplier and purchaser. Significant quantities of prohibited drug were involved.

There are two further counts involving the commercial quantities of prohibited drugs together with an additional supply offence of some significance. The offender is also charged with participating in a criminal group. Whilst the drug the subject of the counts of commercial supply were not ultimately supplied to the first intended recipient they were procured for the purposes of supply to the first intended recipient and ultimately disseminated. The additional criminality in the form one offences needs to be reflected in the sentence imposed for the primary offence.

I will not be specifying a separate sentence for the matters on the Form One but rather take them into account in accordance with s32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW); and I do not impose a separate sentence in that respect.""

7The applicant, Abbas, submitted that although the sentencing judge stated that he was not imposing a separate sentence for the matters on the Form 1, his remarks that greater weight be given to the need for the community's entitlement to extract retribution and that the additional criminality in the Form 1 offences needed to be reflected in the sentence imposed for the primary offence were erroneous and contrary to the principles laid down in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383, Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 and Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; (2003) 212 CLR 629.

8Abbas accepted that the construction placed on s 33 of the Sentencing Act by this Court in Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 (""Attorney General's Reference"") was correct. However, he submitted that Attorney General's Reference had been wrongly applied by the sentencing judge insofar as he expressed the view that the additional criminality in the Form 1 offences needed to be reflected in the sentence imposed for the primary offence. The applicant submitted that the approach to be adopted was set out in the judgments of Adams J in Dionys v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 272; (2011) 217 A Crim R 280 and R v Calcutt [2012] NSWCCA 40, rather than the approach taken by the majority in those cases.

9The relevant provisions of the Sentencing Act provide as follows:

""32(1) In any proceedings for an offence (the principal offence), the prosecutor may file in the court a document that specifies other offences with which the offender has been charged, but not convicted, being offences that the offender has indicated are offences that the offender wants the court to take into account when dealing with the offender for the principal offence.

(2) A list of additional charges may be filed at any time: 

(a) after the court finds the offender guilty of the principal offence, and

(b) before the court deals with the offender for the principal offence.

(3) A copy of the list of additional charges, as filed in the court, is to be given to the offender.

(4) A list of additional charges: 

(a) (Repealed)

(b) must be signed by the offender, and

(c) must be signed by or on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions or by a person, or a person belonging to a class of persons, prescribed by the regulations.

(5) A list of additional charges is taken to be signed on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions if it is signed by a person who is authorised to do so by means of a written order signed by the Director of Public Prosecutions or who belongs to a class of persons so authorised.

(6) A failure to comply with the requirements of this section does not invalidate any sentence imposed by the court for the principal offence.

33(1) When dealing with the offender for the principal offence, the court is to ask the offender whether the offender wants the court to take any further offences into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence.

(2) The court may take a further offence into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence: 

(a) if the offender: 

(i) admits guilt to the further offence, and

(ii) indicates that the offender wants the court to take the further offence into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence, and

(b) if, in all of the circumstances, the court considers it appropriate to do so.

(3) If the court takes a further offence into account, the penalty imposed on the offender for the principal offence must not exceed the maximum penalty that the court could have imposed for the principal offence had the further offence not been taken into account.

(4) A court may not take a further offence into account: 

(a) if the offence is of a kind for which the court has no jurisdiction to impose a penalty, or

(b) if the offence is an indictable offence that is punishable with imprisonment for life.

(5) For the purposes of subsection (4) (a), a court is taken to have jurisdiction to impose a penalty for an offence even if that jurisdiction may only be exercised with the consent of the offender.

(6) Despite subsection (4) (a), the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal and the District Court may take a summary offence into account.

...

35(1) If a further offence is taken into account under this Division: 

(a) the court is to certify, on the list of additional charges, that the further offence has been taken into account, and

(b) no proceedings may be taken or continued in respect of the further offence unless the conviction for the principal offence is quashed or set aside.

(2) This section does not prevent a court that has taken a further offence into account when dealing with an offender for a principal offence from taking the further offence into account if it subsequently imposes a penalty when sentencing or re-sentencing the offender for the principal offence.

(3) An admission of guilt made for the purposes of this Division is not admissible in evidence in any proceedings relating to: 

(a) the further offence in respect of which the admission was made, or

(b) any other offence specified in the list of additional charges.

(4) An offence taken into account under this Division is not, merely because of its being taken into account, to be regarded for any purpose as an offence of which an offender has been convicted.

(5) In or in relation to any criminal proceedings, reference may lawfully be made to, or evidence may lawfully be given of, the fact that a further offence has been taken into account under this Division in imposing a penalty for a principal offence of which an offender has been found guilty if, in or in relation to those proceedings: 

(a) reference may lawfully be made to, or evidence may lawfully be given of, the fact that the offender was found guilty or convicted of the principal offence, and

(b) had the offender been found guilty or convicted of the further offence so taken into account, reference could lawfully have been made to, or evidence could lawfully have been given of, the fact that the offender had been found guilty or convicted of that further offence.

(6) The fact that a further offence has been taken into account under this Division may be proved in the same manner as the conviction for the principal offence.""

10A number of matters may be noted about these sections. First, a further offence can only be taken into account if there is an admission of guilt and an indication by the offender that he or she wishes the offence to be taken into account. Second, the combined effect of s 32 and s 33(2) means that the procedure can be adopted only with the consent of both the Prosecutor and the offender. Third, notwithstanding that consent, the Court has a residual discretion whether or not to take those offences into account. Finally and importantly, the penalty imposed cannot exceed the maximum penalty that the Court could have imposed for the principal offence. In Attorney General's Reference, Spigelman CJ held at [35] that the reference to the maximum penalty which could be imposed was the maximum penalty prescribed by statute for the principal offence. That conclusion is not contested by Abbas or for that matter two of the other applicants, Amoun and Bodiotis. 

11Section 33 of the Sentencing Act has its origin in a non-statutory procedure adopted by the judges of the English Courts, ultimately set down in R v Syres (1908) 25 TLR 71. Its purpose was explained by Lord Diplock in Anderson v Director of Public Prosecutions (1978) AC 964 in the following terms (at 977):

""My Lords, in referring to cases taken into consideration in determining sentence, which the draftsman of the Act did in section 39 (2) and also in section 35 (1) which relates to compensation orders, he was using what has become a well-known term of legal art. It refers to a practice, which apparently has existed since the turn of the century and which received in 1908 the express approval of the newly created Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Syres (1908) 25 T.L.R. 71. The laudable object of the practice is to give to a convicted offender the opportunity when he has served his sentence to start with a clean sheet and not to be arrested at the prison gates for some other offence which he committed before the particular offence which was the cause of his conviction. In effect, this practice involves the convicted offender who has been convicted of one offence in being punished for other offences for which he has never been formally arraigned, tried or convicted and to which he has never formally pleaded guilty.""

12It will be noted that Lord Diplock spoke of the effect being that the offender was punished for other offences for which he had never been formally arraigned, tried or convicted. As was pointed out in Attorney General's Reference at [24], the qualification on this statement expressed by Neasey J in R v Jones (1978) Tas SR 126 should be accepted. The qualification was to the following effect (at 131-132):

""The difficulty is to know to what extent, if any, the sentence may include punishment which is separately referable to the offences taken into account, as distinct from the principal offence. Some judicial statements appear to suggest that part of the sentence may be related specifically to the offences taken into account. For instance, Lord Diplock in D.P.P. v Anderson, in the passage earlier cited, said that the practice involves the offender in being punished for other offences for which he has never been arraigned, tried or convicted. Perhaps his Lordship meant that the effect is to punish the offender for the other offences even though the technical substance of the matter is that the offender may only receive an increased sentence for the principal offence, the increase being justified from considerations arising out of the existence of the other admitted offences. Again, in R. v. Batchelor, Lord Goddard L.C.J. giving judgment for the Court of Criminal Appeal said that the practice of taking other offences into account 'means that the court can give a longer sentence than it would if it were dealing with him only on the charge mentioned in the indictment. But, technically, taking offences into account does not amount to a conviction.' Margrave-Jones, op.cit., at p. 197, refers to the sentence given when this practice is adopted as a 'comprehensive sentence', covering both the substantive crime for which the prisoner stands convicted, and also the other offences which he wishes to be taken into consideration.

However, the Court of Criminal Appeal in England has clearly laid down that the sentence remains one for the principal offence only, notwithstanding the taking into account of other offences.""
(Citations omitted)

13The original precursor of the section, s 447B of the Crimes Act 1900, was introduced by the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1955. In the course of the Second Reading Speech the Attorney General made the following remarks:

""...The purpose of this new section is to empower courts before whom persons are convicted on indictment to take into account other offences which the accused admits. In this the Government is following what is an established practice in England in this same regard, although in England the basis for the practice is not statutory.

The object of the practice is to enable an accused person on release from prison to face civil life without fear of being charged with earlier offences, and it also has the advantage of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings. There has always been a danger that, after a person is released from prison, some vindictive person will invoke the law again, and this provision will prevent that type of action.

It is recognised that care will be needed not to put forward for consideration, when an accused is convicted of one offence, charges that might be of great seriousness. It is felt that this will present no insuperable difficulties, and the frequency with which Attorney-Generals have felt compelled to abandon further criminal charges against accused persons already convicted of two or more offences for which they have received concurrent sentences, suggests that our adopting the English practice will result in a great saving of work and time. Let me illustrate. An accused person may be charged with fifteen cases of break and entering, or fifteen cases of fraudulent misappropriation. He is convicted of one charge and sentenced to, say, three years' imprisonment. He is then convicted of the second charge and, in this case, to show evidence of system, the fact of the other thirteen offences or some of them, may be placed before the judge. The judge, having regard to all the circumstances, imposes a second sentence of three years' imprisonment, but orders that it shall be concurrent with the first sentence so that, in all, the accused will merely serve three years' imprisonment, subject to such automatic remissions as are prescribed by regulations for good conduct.

Where this situation arises, it is quite pointless to proceed with the other thirteen charges. They have already been considered by the judge and he has indicated quite unmistakably that for the whole of the accused's conduct the appropriate penalty is three years' imprisonment, less remissions, concurrent with the original sentence. As the position stands, all of these thirteen cases must now be the subject of a separate report by the Crown Prosecutor, a separate report by the assistant law officer, and then consideration by the Attorney-General.""

14What needs to be interpreted are the words of the section in context and not the Minister's Second Reading Speech: Saeed v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] HCA 23; (2010) 241 CLR 252 at [32]-[33]. However, it does seem apparent that the object of the section was not to impose a distinct penalty for the offences to be taken into account. That is reflected in s 33(3) of the Sentencing Act which provides that any increase in penalty must not exceed the maximum penalty that the Court could have imposed for the principal offence. 

15So much was made clear in Attorney General's Reference. In that case Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, expressly rejected what he described as a ""top down"" approach involving the identification of an appropriate penalty for the full gamut of offences and then the application of a discount to take account of the principle of totality: see Attorney General's Reference at [24]-[29]. His Honour's ultimate conclusion on this issue was summarised at [29]:

""[29] I do not understand Wood CJ at CL's reference in R v Bavadra to the 'totality of criminality' to suggest that a sentencing judge should determine sentences for all the offences before the judge, whether on the indictment or on the Form 1. I understand his Honour to have intended no more than the proposition for which Simpson J referred to R v Bavadra as authority in R v Harris (2001) 125 A Crim R 27 at 31 [23] that a sentencing judge '... should give due recognition to the gravity of those offences'. If, contrary to my understanding, the reference in R v Bavadra was intended to suggest that a sentencing judge was imposing punishment for the Form 1 offences, I would respectfully disagree that this is permissible under the statute. The focus, as I will show below, must be on 'the principal offence' alone.""

16His Honour's approach was summarised in the following paragraphs of his judgment:

""[18] A number of propositions with respect to the process of taking into account matters on a Form 1 are well established and are uncontroversial. First, the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence (or to alter the nature of the sentence) than would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone. Secondly, it is wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small. Sometimes it will be substantial. (See, eg, R v White (1981) 28 SASR 9 at 13; Murrell v The Queen (1985) 4 FCR 168 at 179, per Blackburn J; R v Vougdis (1989) 41 A Crim R 125 at 128-129; R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371-372).

[19] These authorities focus on the sentence that is appropriate for the charge on the indictment, with a view to increasing it by reason of the Form 1 offences for which guilt has been admitted. This can be characterised as a 'bottom up' approach.

...

[23] The Court must, of course, give effect to the statutory regime. However, it does so in a context in which the basic principle of the common law is that no-one should be punished for an offence of which he or she has not been convicted. (R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 at 389, 395-396; R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 278 [18].) The offences on a Form 1 constitute an admission of guilt, but there is no conviction.

...

[39] The sentencing court is sentencing only for the 'principal offence'. It is no part of the task of the sentencing court to determine appropriate sentences for offences listed on a Form 1 or to determine the overall sentence that would be appropriate for all the offences and then apply a 'discount' for the use of the procedure. This is not sentencing for the principal offence. 

[40] In my opinion, it is pertinent to identify the elements to be considered in determining the sentence for the primary offence upon which the commission of other offences, for which no conviction is being recorded, may impinge. The case law has identified a number of distinct and sometimes overlapping purposes to be served by sentencing. In my opinion, not all these purposes are relevant to the process of taking other offences into account, when sentencing for a particular offence, that is, the primary offence. 

[41] In R v Barton (at 195 [64]), in a passage subsequently referred to in R v AEM Snr (at [81]) and R v Perese (at 522 [81]), I made some observations which I repeat. 

[42] The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another.""

17The principal difference between the parties in the present case involves what Spigelman CJ meant in par [42] of his judgment, where he referred to the Court giving weight to the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has been imposed. As I indicated earlier, each of the applicants, other than Taleb, submitted the correct approach was that of Adams J in Dionys supra and Calcutt supra. In the former case his Honour made the following comments at [9] and [10]:

""[9] In Grube the appellant submitted that, where an offence, considered by itself could attract a sentence in a posited range, Form 1 offences might justify a sentence at the top of that range but no further. Hall J (Grove and Howie JJ agreeing) in the course of rejecting this submission, said - 

'[36] Many of the 42 offences on the Form 1 involved invasions of residential premises and property stolen was of considerable value. When the court is required to take into account a multiplicity of serious offences, as in this case, it is required to allow for the total criminality revealed by the whole course of the offender's conduct as appropriately reflected in the sentence. If there was, as argued in the present application, a requirement to apply a proportionality or relativity concept, then in some circumstances, including those that arise in the present matter, there would be a risk of the imposition of a penalty that did not adequately reflect the total criminality. The seriousness of such an outcome is apparent for it would potentially, if not actually, tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute in certain cases by mandating a process or approach that produced a manifestly inadequate sentence determined on an unduly narrow or artificial basis.

[37] The number and magnitude of the offences in the Form 1 in the present matter, in my opinion, justified the sentence imposed ... which increased the sentence that was appropriate for the principal offence to reflect the total criminality that took place over a considerable period of time arising from so many offences committed over a widespread geographical area in Sydney and beyond. [The judge] was required to have regard to the elements of personal deterrence and retribution in relation to the Form 1 offences and I believe he did so without any double counting as asserted by the applicant. 
(Emphasis added.) 

[10] If the italicised phrase is taken to suggest that, in punishing for the substantive charges, the court can punish additionally for the Form 1 charges, in my respectful opinion it is inconsistent with the principle for which AG's Reference No 1 of 2002 stands. The 'total criminality revealed by the offender's conduct' of course includes all the offences including those on the Form 1. It was necessary, as Hall J explained, for the primary judge to have regard to the 'elements of personal deterrence and retribution in relation to the Form 1 offences'. In my respectful opinion, it is simply not open to punish for the criminality involved in the Form 1 offences, nor to increase the sentence otherwise necessary in respect of the substantive offence to deter the offender from committing offences such as the substantive offence nor to exact retribution for the Form 1 offences. The Form 1 offences inform both the objective nature of the criminality involved in the substantive offence and the subjective features such as remorse and the prospects for rehabilitation and may therefore justify or even require a heavier penalty than would have been imposed had that offence stood alone. But, with respect, that sentence cannot in any sense exact retribution, that is to say, punish, for the Form 1 offences.""

18Hoeben J, as his Honour then was, with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed, gave a somewhat wider interpretation of the section:

""[65] What is clear from the above paragraphs is that while the Court is sentencing only for the principal offence and not for the Form 1 offences, the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence and that the additional component may not be small. While not excluding other considerations, the Chief Justice referred specifically to greater weight being given to personal deterrence and to 'the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed'.""

19A similar difference of opinion arose in Calcutt supra. In that case Adams J, after referring to his discussion of Attorney General's Reference in Dionys supra, made the following remarks:

""[42] Firstly, it is not in issue, of course, that the Form 1 offence must be taken into account. The crucial question concerns the way in which this is to be done. In my respectful view, the sentence for the primary offence can only be increased to take account of a Form 1 offence to the extent that the commission of that offence indicates that

'the need for personal deterrence ... ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged ... [and] the community's entitlement to exact retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed': Re Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 per Spigelman CJ at [42].

The first consideration is easily appreciated; so far as the second is concerned it must be understood as subject to the fundamental principle that 'the focus throughout must be on sentencing for the primary offence' (ibid at [43]) and the approach that 'in some senses [semble, in any sense] sentences were being imposed for the Form 1 offences ...[must be] rejected' (ibid at [45]). The extent to which the second consideration is 'always material in the sentencing process' gives some guidance as to the way in which it is to be understood. It is, with respect, clear that his Honour was not suggesting that the offender can be punished for uncharged (though admitted) crimes. Rather, the criminality of the primary crime is to be assessed in light of those other offences. The significance of the other offences will vary from case to case but committing an offence in the course of other criminality is, to a greater or lesser degree, more inherently serious than committing that offence in isolation and the measure of retribution is accordingly greater. The other offences may well also be material to the offender's subjective case. Thus, the Form 1 procedure is no more than a convenient and transparent process that allows the uncharged offences to be taken into account to the extent that they reflect on the seriousness of the primary offence and the other factors relevant to assessing the appropriate sentence for that offence and also giving the offender the certainty that he or she will not be further or separately punished for them. 

[43] Put somewhat differently, I do not accept that the Court intended in Re Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 to qualify in the slightest degree the fundamental principle that a person cannot be punished for offences for which he or she has not been convicted, as the passages to which I have referred demonstrate. Thus, the significance of the Form 1 offences can never be considered in isolation but always and only by assessing their impact on the relevant issues which fall to be considered in sentencing for the primary offence and for that offence alone. Those issues are not expanded, though of course they might well be informed, by the commission of the Form 1 offence. I therefore respectfully disagree with interpretations of Re Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 that give to the reference to retribution the effect, in substance if not in form, that directly or indirectly subverts the fundamental principle to which I have referred.""

20Whealy JA and Latham J took a different view. In par [24] of his judgment, Whealy JA expressed agreement with what was said by this Court in R v Grube [2005] NSWCCA 140:

""[24] In R v Grube [2005] NSWCCA 140, this Court rejected an argument that where matters are taken into account on a Form 1, the penalty for the principal offence is limited by the appropriate range for that offence. Hall J (with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed) observed:

'Thus in the hypothetical example posed by Howie J in argument, taking into account matters on a Form 1 may well put the appropriate penalty above the range of 3 to 5 years that would otherwise apply to the principal offence. An appeal to notions of proportionality or relativity is then neither supported by the terms of Div 3 of Pt 3 nor by the principles as stated by the Chief Justice in the guideline judgment.'""

See also Latham J at [76].

21It may be that on many occasions the differing approaches will not give rise to different results. However, the critical difference is that the view of Adams J, particularly as expressed in Dionys supra, is that it is not open to provide in sentencing for the criminality involved in the Form 1 offences, nor to exact retribution for them.

22In my respectful opinion, the approach suggested by Adams J is incorrect if it is interpreted as meaning that a sentence cannot be increased to take into account an additional need for deterrence and retribution in respect of the offences charged by virtue of the Form 1 offences being taken into account. Such an interpretation is contrary, in my opinion, to the meaning of s 33 properly construed and to what was said by Spigelman CJ in Attorney General's Reference. Section 33(1) empowers the Court to take the further offences into account where the preconditions in that section and s 32 are met. It is clear from the provisions of s 33(3) that that could lead to an increase in penalty up to the maximum penalty for the principal offence. The existence of these additional offences may demonstrate the greater need for personal deterrence and retribution in respect of the offence charged. This does not mean the Court is imposing a separate penalty for the Form 1 offences. Rather, as part of the instinctive synthesis approach to sentencing explained by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]-[54], it takes these matters into account as required by the statute in determining the appropriate penalty for the offence for which the offender is convicted.

23That approach would generally, but not universally, lead to the imposition of a sentence longer, and in some cases significantly longer, than would otherwise be required if the Form 1 offences were not taken into account: R v Barton [2001] NSWCCA 63; (2001) 121 A Crim R 185. That does not mean that the principle of proportionality referred to by the High Court in cases such as Hoare v The Queen [1989] HCA 33; (1989) 167 CLR 348 at 354; Veen v The Queen (No 2) supra at 472 and 477; Markarian supra at [83], is offended. Rather, the fact that the sentence is to be determined by reference to the additional need for personal deterrence and retribution for the offence for which the offender is being sentenced as a result of the Form 1 charges means that the principle of proportionality falls to be assessed by reference to matters which include those additional factors. That does not involve any injustice to the offender who has chosen to avail him or herself of the s 33 procedure. Nor does it mean that the offender is being sentenced for offences for which he or she has not been convicted. This is because the sentence is imposed by reference to the offence for which the offender has been convicted, by contrast to the ""top down"" approach rejected in Attorney General's Reference.

24That approach, in my opinion, is consistent with the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Attorney General's Reference. I have set out the relevant paragraphs of the judgment above. Spigelman CJ expressly rejected the ""top down"" approach to the question. At [23], his Honour stated that the statutory regime must be given effect in the context of what was decided by the High Court in De Simoni supra and R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270. At [42], his reference to retribution was a reference to retribution in respect of the offences for which the sentence was imposed, albeit in the context of the existence of offences for which no punishment had been imposed. Further, at [67], his Honour emphasised that the Court had a discretion whether or not to take the Form 1 offences into account. 

25I would add two matters. First, the manner in which Form 1 offences are to be taken into account is not the same as the manner in respect of which prior convictions are considered. That is because the Form 1 offences have not been the subject of punishment: R v Barton supra at [63]. 

26There may be cases in which it is not possible to properly take Form 1 offences into account by reference to the additional need for punishment and retribution in respect of the convicted offence. This will generally only occur in cases where the gravity of the Form 1 offence is far in excess of those for which the offender is being sentenced, or when the magnitude of the offences on the Form 1 make it impossible to take them into account in sentencing for the convicted offence. In these circumstances the Court should decline to take the Form 1 offences into account. That approach is consistent with the approach taken in R v Jones supra. In that case Neasey J declined to take into account offences which he considered to be of far greater gravity than the offences for which the offender was committed for sentence. At 134, his Honour summarised the position as follows:

""The 'other offences' are of a gravity far in excess of those in respect of which the defendant has been committed for sentence, and of themselves would be likely to attract a substantially greater sentence. They have, it is said, been committed over approximately the same time span as the principal offences; they are not offences which would be likely to be unknown to the Crown if the defendant had not revealed them; the means of proof of the 'other offences' available to the Crown would appear to be much the same as that available in respect of the offences charged in the complaints. In all the circumstances, therefore, I decline to take the other offences into account.""

27In the case of Abbas, the sentencing judge was conscious of the guideline judgment. His reference to the community's entitlement to extract retribution is plainly a reference to what was said in par [42] of Attorney General's Reference. His Honour emphasised that he was not imposing a separate sentence for the Form 1 offence. In those circumstances, there does not seem to be any error of discretion. 

28It follows that Ground 1 of the application is not made out.

29In each of the applications of Amoun and Bodiotis, in so far as they raise an identically expressed ground dealing with their Form 1 offences, for the reasons I have just expressed, I am not persuaded that there has been any error of discretion by the sentencing judge. 

30There were other grounds argued in respect of each of the other applications. I agree with the reasons of Garling J on these grounds and with the orders which he proposes in each application.

31BASTEN JA: It is a fundamental principle of the criminal law that no person should be punished except for an offence for which he or she has been convicted, whether following a plea of guilty or a jury verdict: The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383 at 389 (Gibbs CJ). However, like most bald statements of principle, its application in particular circumstances may be contestable and it may be qualified by statute. The present case concerns the qualification required in ""taking further offences into account"", in accordance with the scheme so described in Part 3, Division 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""), being ss 31-35.

32The statutory scheme identifies an offence known as ""the principal offence"" and other or further offences which the court may ""take into account when dealing with the offender for the principal offence"": ss 32(1) and 33(2). The further offences must be ones with which the offender has been charged, but not convicted (s 32(1)) but in respect of which the offender ""admits guilt"" and wishes the court to take them into account in dealing with the principal offence: s 33(2). 

33As an administrative matter, the further offences are to be set out in a ""list of additional charges"" which is required to be in an approved form: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Regulation 2010, cl 4(1). The approved form is ""Form 1"" made under the Regulation, which has given rise to the popular description of such further offences as ""Form 1 offences"".

34A number of aspects of the principles and procedures to be adopted in dealing with Form 1 offences were identified by this Court in Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146. A guideline judgment, delivered pursuant to s 37(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act does not contain orders, but rather ""guidelines to be taken into account by courts sentencing offenders"": s 36. It may be inferred that Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 (delivered by Spigelman CJ; Woods CJ at CL, Grove, Sully and James JJ agreeing) was intended to apply generally to courts sentencing offenders in circumstances where Form 1 offences were sought to be taken into account.

35The primary propositions to be derived from Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 are that the exercise being undertaken is sentencing only for the principal offence (at [39]) but that the further offences can affect the sentence for the principal offence, for example, by demonstrating an increased need for personal deterrence or justifying a greater entitlement on the part of the community to exact retribution: at [42].

Issue in contention - context
36No party sought to challenge any aspect of Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002. Nor is this a guideline judgment, but rather a set of appeals, some of which raise related questions as to the correct approach in sentencing for further offences.

37Furthermore, no party queried the manner in which principles in a guideline judgment should operate in particular circumstances. Perhaps ironically, the statutory provision for guideline judgments requires that they contain guidelines ""to be taken into account"" by courts sentencing offenders.

38How a particular matter is to be ""taken into account"" by a court exercising a discretionary power is not a question which gives rise to a single or precise answer. Much will depend on the particular matters in question. Further, the problems raised by Form 1 offences are not unique: other circumstances may give rise to analogous problems. These points may be illustrated by considering, for example, the following broad factors:

(a) the relationship between the further offences and the principal offence, and
(b) the relationship between the further offences and other factors relevant to sentencing for the principal offence.

39The first broad factor, namely the relationship between the further offences and the principal offence, may take a number of different forms. For example, the relationship may be temporal only. Thus, counsel for Mr Abbas suggested as an example the driver of a car stopped and tested for alcohol in circumstances giving rise to suspicion as to the purpose of the trip; a search of the car revealed a package containing a kilo of cocaine. Those circumstances might give rise to a serious drug charge as the principal offence, with a 'high range prescribed content of alcohol' charge on a Form 1. Realistically, the driving offence could have no significant impact on the appropriate sentence for the drug offence, although it might itself invite a custodial penalty if separately charged.

40By contrast, the further offences on the Form 1 might be highly relevant to the principal offence because they are of a like kind. They would then provide a basis for treating the principal offence as representative of an ongoing course of conduct. However, the description of charges as ""representative"" may arise otherwise than by way of identifying further offences on a Form 1. In some circumstances, such as child sexual assault cases, the difficulty of identifying further offences with sufficient precision may preclude their inclusion on a Form 1. Nevertheless, it is obviously desirable that there be conformity in approach in sentencing for representative charges and in dealing with further offences on a Form 1, where they and the principal offence are of a like kind. If different approaches are required, the differences should be identified.

41The second broad factor involves the relationship between the further offences and other circumstances relevant to sentencing on the principal offence. Counsel for Mr Abbas posited, by way of example, an offender with a long record of similar offences and poor prospects of rehabilitation. In that situation, the inclusion of further similar offences on a Form 1 might have little or no effect on the sentence imposed for the principal offence. The example appeared to assume that had the further offences been dealt with in their own right, they would have attracted significant punishments.

42The purpose of the examples was to demonstrate the differential effects of the further offences (1) in determining whether an increased penalty should be imposed for the principal offence because the further offences would have warranted additional punishment if separately charged and (2) in assessing their effect, if any, on the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed for the principal offence. The ultimate submission was that the trial judge, in taking account of the seriousness of the Form 1 offences, had in effect imposed a penalty referable specifically to those offences, rather than taking them into account in determining the appropriate sentence for the principal offence.

43Counsel for Mr Abbas sought to illustrate the significance of the distinction by reference to the decision of this Court in R v Calcutt [2012] NSWCCA 40. The principal charge in that case involved knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a large commercial quantity of MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. When the police searched the applicant's home, the manufacturing process was in operation and officers seized a quantity of MDMA weighing almost 60 kilograms. An amount of cocaine, weighing 102.7 grams, was also located. There was no evidence of actual supply of cocaine, but a charge of supply cocaine was included on the Form 1, on the basis of the quantity involved. In sentencing the offender, the trial judge, Hock DCJ, noted that ""the supply cocaine is a separate and serious matter, the amount being 20 times the indictable quantity of 5 grams"" which, she concluded, ""must lead to an increase in the sentence."" The majority in Calcutt (Whealy JA and Latham J) concluded that no error was involved in this approach. In dissent, Adams J held that the Form 1 offences ""did not add significantly to the criminality of the principal offence and, accordingly, ought not to increase the sentence otherwise appropriate for that offence"": at [40]. After referring to passages in the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002, Adams J stated at [43]:

""Put somewhat differently, I do not accept that the Court intended in Re Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 to qualify in the slightest degree the fundamental principle that a person cannot be punished for offences for which he or she has not been convicted, as the passages to which I have referred demonstrate. Thus, the significance of the Form 1 offences can never be considered in isolation but always and only by assessing their impact on the relevant issues which fall to be considered in sentencing for the primary offence and for that offence alone. Those issues are not expanded, though of course they might well be informed, by the commission of the Form 1 offence. I therefore respectfully disagree with interpretations of Re Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 that give to the reference to retribution the effect, in substance if not in form, that directly or indirectly subverts the fundamental principle to which I have referred.""

44Adams J expressed similar views in Dionys v R [2011] NSWCCA 272.

Limits on sentence
45Before turning to the substance of the contention, it is convenient to dispose of one matter of statutory interpretation which was not in issue. The Sentencing Procedure Act provides:

""33 Outstanding charges may be taken into account

...

(3) If the court takes a further offence into account, the penalty imposed on the offender for the principal offence must not exceed the maximum penalty that the court could have imposed for the principal offence had the further offence not been taken into account.""

46There is an element of ambiguity in this provision. The reference to ""the maximum penalty"" could refer to that which could properly be imposed having regard to the circumstances of the offending, but disregarding the further offences. Alternatively, it could refer to the maximum penalty for the generic offence. By way of example, the maximum penalty for robbery under s 94 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) is imprisonment for 14 years; on the other hand the maximum penalty which could be imposed in a particular case (that is one which would not be reduced on appeal) may be four years. 

47It might be thought that the reference to the maximum penalty was intended to refer to that prescribed by statute. The ambiguity arises for two reasons. First, instead of saying the maximum penalty for which the offender was liable in respect of the principal offence, the provision refers to the maximum penalty that ""the court could have imposed"" for the principal offence. Secondly, the provision introduces a final contingency, by the words ""had the further offence not been taken into account"". Taking the further offence into account could not have changed the statutorily prescribed maximum penalty, but could only have changed the maximum penalty appropriate to the principal offence the subject of the charge. If s 33(3) did not refer to the statutory maximum, taking into account a further offence might merely remove a basis for leniency. In that way it would have the same limited effect as treating a charge as a representative offence, preventing the charged offences being seen as aberrant conduct, rather than as part of a course of misconduct. As will be noted below, the Form 1 is understood to have a broader scope for increasing the penalty for a particular offence.

48The ambiguity was resolved in Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 as a reference to the statutory maximum penalty for the generic offence: at [35], final bullet point; adopting the reasoning of Neasey J in Regina v Jones [1978] Tas SR 126 at 133-134. However, that case discussed a predecessor to s 33(3), being s 447B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), which Neasey J said contained ""a proviso that when offences are taken into account the sentence imposed may not exceed the maximum penalty allowed for the principal offence"". Section 447B as then in force contained the following proviso to sub-s (1):

""Provided that the sentence passed in any such case upon the person so convicted shall not exceed the maximum sentence that may be passed in respect of the offence of which he has been convicted.""

That, it may be remarked, is not the same language as that now contained in s 33(3), but the change in language appears to have been treated as inconsequential.

49Reference in s 33(3) to the maximum penalty ""the court could have imposed"" would cover the case of a local court with limited powers, regardless of the maximum penalty prescribed in the offence-creating legislation: Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 267; Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), Part 4, Div 2.

An analogy - representative charges
50Cases dealing with ""representative charges"" are instructive, because they are distinct from the situation where further offences are admitted and dealt with pursuant to the statutory Form 1 procedure. The available approach was discussed in Giles v Director of Public Prosecutions [2009] NSWCCA 308; 198 A Crim R 395 by reference to the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209; 112 A Crim R 466.

""47 There are two reasons why the problems generated by representative charges are intractable. One is that they involve a tension between the jealous protection properly afforded by the courts to the principle that no one should be punished for an offence without the conduct being proved beyond reasonable doubt, or admitted: Anderson v DPP [1978] AC 964 at 977-978 (Lord Diplock); Murrell v R (1985) 4 FCR 168 at 175 (Fox J, Bowen CJ agreeing); R v O'Connell [1993] 2 NZLR 442 at 443. On the other hand, there is a pragmatic consideration that the prosecution be able 'to strike the proper balance between overloading an indictment, on the one hand, and, failing to reflect the alleged criminality by charging a limited range of counts, on the other hand': JCW at [64] (Spigelman CJ). ...
...

51 It is undoubtedly important that where a charge is treated as 'representative' of a broader range of conduct, two further criteria must be fulfilled, namely: 

(a) the conduct relied upon by the prosecution is identified with a degree of precision, and
(b) the trial judge is satisfied that the conduct so specified is either proved or admitted by the offender.

The purpose of requiring a degree of precision is to ensure that the offender understands what he or she is conceding and the Court understands what it is taking into account: see, JCW at [63] and [67].

52 The last-mentioned purposes can, to an extent, be satisfied by the use of statutory provisions permitting outstanding charges to be taken into account: cf Sentencing Procedure Act, s 33 and the use, adopted in this case, of a 'Form 1' listing other offences which the offender may invite the Court to take into account. Such a procedure will ensure that the offender is conscious of the precise matters to which he or she is admitting guilt and that the Court has identified offences before it. However, that procedure has its limitations. Such offences can only be taken into account once in relation to a specified offence and do not in terms involve an overall course of conduct.

...

56 The real issue in this case is whether it is appropriate to take a course of conduct into account, to the extent it has been admitted, in order to place the individual offences in a higher range of objective seriousness than would otherwise be the case.""

51In JCW, Spigelman CJ concluded that the general question as to whether, and if so when, a higher sentence could be imposed did not require a definitive answer, but indicated that the preferred course was to adopt the statutory scheme provided by Part 3, Div 3 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, stating at [63]:

""In my opinion, to use such matters as a circumstance of aggravation, if permissible at all, requires, at the least, sufficient particularisation so that the sentencing judge can tell with precision what range of conduct the charges admitted to be 'representative' are in fact representative of. The extent, if any, to which an admission, other than in the context of the statutory procedure to which I have referred above, can be taken into account as a matter of aggravation, should be carefully confined.

52It is thus apparent that the Form 1 procedure has been viewed, at least in this State, as the course by which other offending can properly be taken into account to increase the severity of the sentence imposed for the principal offence. The further offences are the subject of charges and are formally admitted.

Abbas - ground 1
53Mr Abbas was charged with two offences: each involved knowingly taking part in the supply of methylamphetamine over two consecutive periods in May 2008. Each involved a commercial quantity: in respect of count 1 the actual quantity was 500 grams and in respect of count 2 it was 372 grams. Count 1, but not count 2, was accompanied by a Form 1 with four further offences, namely:

(1) knowingly taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (284g).
(2) knowingly taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity of MDMA (400g);
(3) participating in a criminal group, knowing participation contributed to criminal activity, and
(4) agreeing to supply cocaine (56g).

54Judge Zahra dealt with the further offences towards the end of a carefully reasoned judgment: at pp 36-37. He noted that the ""proper treatment of Form 1 matters"" was considered by this Court in Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 and continued:

""Here the criminality in the matters on the Form 1 is substantial. The offender acted as a conduit between the supplier and purchaser. Significant quantities of prohibited drug were involved.

There are two further counts involving the commercial quantities of prohibited drugs together with an additional supply offence of some significance. The offender is also charged with participating in a criminal group. Whilst the drug[s] the subject of the counts of commercial supply were not ultimately supplied to the first intended recipient they were procured for the purposes of supply to the first intended recipient and ultimately disseminated.

The additional criminality in the Form 1 offences needs to be reflected in the sentence imposed for the primary offence.""

55In accordance with the contentions identified above, it was the last sentence of these reasons which was said to reveal error.

56The sentences were significantly different. Thus, in respect of count 2, which involved no offences on a Form 1, the offender was sentenced to imprisonment for four years six months, with a non-parole period of two years and six months. On the first count (involving the Form 1 offences) the offender was sentenced to seven years imprisonment with a nonparole period of four years.

57The conduct the subject of counts 1 and 2 was closely related both in time and in the nature of the arrangements. The role of the applicant in each case appears to have been similar, although it is possible to infer from the reasons at pp 36-38 that the applicant played a somewhat more serious role in relation to count 1 than in relation to count 2. The personal circumstances of the applicant were common in respect of both counts. There can be no doubt that at least a large part of the discrepancy in the sentences should be attributed to the further offences on the Form 1.

Resolution of appeal - ground 1
58Despite counsel for all parties disowning any challenge to Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that such was the substantive effect of the submissions. Thus, if the further offences required greater personal deterrence, that followed from the need for punishment for those offences, the additional punishment being only notionally applied to the principal offence. Similarly, if the community was entitled to exact retribution on account of the further offences, again the increased penalty was only nominally attributable to the principal offence.

59The tension within the reasoning in Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 requires resolution in order to dispose of the appeal. The tension, however, does not require the Court to revisit the correctness of the judgment. The tension arises from the following passages:

""22 The choice between a 'top down' approach and a 'bottom up' approach, raises an important issue of principle with respect to which there is uncertain and perhaps conflicting guidance in previous decisions of this Court.

23 The Court must, of course, give effect to the statutory regime. However, it does so in a context in which the basic principle of the common law is that no-one should be punished for an offence of which he or she has not been convicted. (R v De Simoni ... at 389, 395-396; R v Olbrich ... at [18].) The offences on a Form 1 constitute an admission of guilt, but there is no conviction.

24 The 'top down' approach which, notionally, identifies an appropriate penalty for the full gamut of offences, appears to me to be inconsistent with this principle. No doubt it can be said that even the 'bottom up' approach involves, in a sense, punishment 'for' the Form 1 offences, because the penalty for the primary offence is increased.""

60Although Spigelman CJ referred to a person not being punished for an offence for which he or she ""has not been convicted"", the references to De Simoni suggest the bar should not be placed so high. True it is that Gibbs CJ at 389 referred to an offence for which the person ""has not been convicted"", as did Wilson J at 395. Wilson J was in dissent, but he elaborated on the basic principle in terms which are not in doubt.

""The primary rule is that the judge must sentence the prisoner for the offence of which he has been convicted. He must not, even though the actual sentence may be within the range allowed for that offence, sentence for some other more serious offence which he is satisfied has been committed .... On the other hand, the judge is not only entitled but bound to take into consideration the circumstances surrounding the offence of which the prisoner has been convicted, so long as those circumstances are not inconsistent with the plea or verdict .... But he must not punish the prisoner for additional offences with which he has not been charged ....""

61De Simoni was not concerned with the kind of issue raised in the present case; it concerned a person convicted on a charge of robbery with actual violence, but without reference to wounding, which constituted a ""circumstance of aggravation"". Section 582 of the Criminal Code (WA) stated that ""if any circumstance of aggravation is intended to be relied upon, it must be charged in the indictment"". Thus the majority concluded that the offender could only be sentenced on the basis of an assault resulting in wounding if the charge of which he had been convicted included wounding as the circumstance of aggravation.

62As this Court noted in Einfeld v R [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1; 266 ALR 598:

""144 There are various ways in which conduct constituting an uncharged offence may properly be taken into account. In De Simoni, Gibbs CJ referred to the decision of the English Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Huchison [1972] 1 WLR 398, in support of the principle his Honour was stating: at 390. Huchison involved a charge of a single count of incest between father and daughter, to which the appellant had pleaded guilty. However, the daughter's statement referred to repeated courses of intercourse over a significant period. This material was relied upon by the sentencing judge. That was held to be inadmissible, but Phillimore LJ, in delivering the judgment of the Court, stated at 399:

""Of course there are cases where the prosecution puts forward a count as a sample count, and in those cases it is well-understood that if that course is taken and the defence are notified, a judge is entitled to deal with the whole matter on the basis that the offence in fact was repeated more than once, or there were some other similar incidents. But that is not this case; this was put forward as a single offence ....""

... 

146 To read the principle established by De Simoni beyond its immediate context would give rise to consequences which were not addressed and which would involve an extrapolation of the principle beyond that which is necessary to give effect to its purpose. For example, a course of unlawful conduct may well give rise to a number of possible charges. If the prosecution proceeds on one count only, it does not follow that the surrounding conduct cannot be taken into account in sentencing. The surrounding conduct cannot give rise to a more serious offence, but it can demonstrate the degree of seriousness with which the charged offence should be viewed. 

147 The purpose underlying the principle is to avoid unfairness to the accused who may be faced (on the sentencing hearing) with complaints about his conduct which did not form part of the charge and which he did not expect to meet when he pleaded guilty. However, the fact that such conduct may be relevant often leads an offender to seek to establish the factual basis upon which the matter will proceed if he or she pleads to a particular count. Further, the elements identified in the present case as false, although not the subject of separate charges, were conceded by the plea in respect of the particular false statement. The applicant did not deny making the statements, nor could he deny their falsity. However, it was not the moral culpability flowing from their falsity which was taken into account; it was the characteristic attaching to the charged false statement, for which they provided the evidential basis.""

63In The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [18], the Court noted that it would be ""quite wrong to sentence an offender for crimes with which that offender is not charged"" (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ). That was said in a context where the precise role of the offender in a drug importation was unclear. The question of charge or conviction was not directly relevant: whether or not the offender was a courier, a principal or occupied some other role in the criminal enterprise was not revealed by the plea or by the statement of agreed facts upon which the sentencing was based. The offender had claimed that he was a courier but had been disbelieved. The case is important because it illustrates the difficulties which can arise in identifying the correct basis for sentencing an offender where a statement of agreed facts is incomplete, where the offender or other witnesses are called on sentence and give evidence inconsistent with the agreed facts and where the plea or verdict does not clearly reveal circumstances of the offending which might be relevant on sentence. 

64Importantly, the Chief Justice in Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 noted that the court must give effect to the statutory regime. He expressly envisaged that taking into account further offences might increase the sentence imposed for the principal offence in a way which could be said to punish ""for"" the further offences. In this respect, the logical analysis undertaken by Adams J in Calcutt was inappropriate. What was clearly rejected in Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 was an approach which sought to assess possible sentences with respect to the further offences, discount them and then impose an appropriate additional penalty in respect of the principal offence: [34]. It did not reject an effective increase in the sentence for the principal offence on account of the additional criminality revealed in the admitted further offences.

65In the present case the approach explained by Judge Zahra was not that rejected in the guideline judgment: nor, despite the substantially greater sentence imposed on count 1, was there any reason to suppose that the sentencing judge in fact did what he had expressly eschewed. Accordingly, no error has been demonstrated. Ground 1 should be rejected.

66In respect of the other matters raised in these applications for leave to appeal, orders should be made as proposed by Garling J, for the reasons he gives.

67HOEBEN CJ at CL: On 14 February 2013 these four matters came before this Court by way of applications for leave to appeal against sentence. The appeal of Abbas raised the approach by this Court to offences on a Form 1, in accordance with ss31-35 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act). When these matters came before the Court, counsel for Messrs Amoun and Bodiotis advised that they wished to take the same point. The issue did not arise in the case of Taleb.

68Counsel for those applicants raising the issue, submitted that they did not challenge the correctness of the guideline judgment in Attorney-General's Application under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 (the guideline judgment). The decisions they challenged in various respects, were R v Grube [2005] NSWCCA 140, Dionys v R [2011] NSWCCA 272 and R v Calcutt [2012] NSWCCA 40. As a result, the applications were heard by a five judge bench. Another reason for a bench of five was that a special leave application in Calcutt was before the High Court (Calcutt v The Queen [2012] HCA Trans 221) and had been adjourned to enable the issue to be argued in this Court.

69In Abbas the issue was raised by the following ground of appeal:

Ground 1: His Honour erred in increasing the sentence in respect of Count 1 in order to reflect the additional criminality of the Form 1 offences.

70In Amoun the relevant ground of appeal was: 

Ground 3: His Honour erred in the manner in which he took into account in sentencing for the offence on count 1, the offences on the Form 1 schedule.

71Mr Bodiotis relied upon the same ground of appeal as Amoun.

72These reasons relate only to the Form 1 issue raised by these grounds of appeal. I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons of the Chief Justice on this issue. I respectfully adopt the reasons of the Chief Justice and his conclusion. I wish, however, to make the following additional observations.

Factual background

73The factual background to each application for leave to appeal has been set out by Garling J and I adopt that summary. In these reasons, I have focused on the application for leave to appeal by Mr Abbas because his was the application in which written submissions were filed. Moreover, the approach of the sentencing judge to the Form 1 offences was the same in each matter.

74Mr Abbas pleaded guilty to the following counts:

Count 1 - That he between 7 May 2008 and 10 May 2008 at Auburn in the State of New South Wales did knowingly take part in the supply of an amount of a prohibited drug to wit, 500 grams of Methylamphetamine, being an amount not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.

Count 2 - That he between 17 May 2008 and 18 May 2008 at Auburn in the State of New South Wales did knowingly take part in the supply of an amount of a prohibited drug to wit, 372 of Methylamphetamine, being an amount not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.

75Both those counts involved offences contrary to s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and each carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and/or a fine of 3,500 penalty units. An offence under s25(2) also carried a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

76The sentencing judge was asked to take into account the following matters on a Form 1.

(i) Between about 11 and 12 May 2008 at Auburn in the state of NSW did knowingly take part in the supply of the commercial quantity of Methylamphetamine (284 g).

(ii) Between about 11 and 12 May 2008 at Auburn in the State of NSW did knowingly take part in the supply of the commercial quantity of 3,4 Methylendioxymethamphetamine (400 g).

(iii) On 21 May 2008 at Auburn in the State of NSW did participate in a criminal group knowing that his participation contributed to criminal activity, contrary to s93T(1) Crimes Act 1900.

(iv) Between 30 and 31 May 2008 at Holbrook in the State of NSW did agree to supply 56 g cocaine contrary to s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.

Matters 1 and 2 on the Form 1 carried the same penalty structure as the primary counts, matter 3 carried a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment and matter 4 carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.

77The sentencing judge dealt with the Form 1 matters as follows:

""Form 1

The proper treatment of Form 1 matters was considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the guideline judgment in Attorney-General's Application No 1/2002 [2002] 56 NSWLR 147.

The fact that there are matters to be taken into account on the Form 1 means that in an appropriate case, greater weight should be given to the needs of personal deterrence and the community's entitlement to exact retribution. The point of the process may be to impose a longer sentence or alter the nature of the sentence that would be imposed if the primary sentence stood alone. 

Here the criminality in the matters on the Form 1 is substantial. The offender acted as a conduit between the supplier and the purchaser. Significant quantities of prohibited drugs were involved.

There are two further counts involving the commercial quantities of prohibited drugs together with an additional supply offence of some significance. The offender is also charged with participating in a criminal group. Whilst the drugs, the subject of the counts of commercial supply were not ultimately supplied to the first intended recipient they were procured for the purposes of supply to the first intended recipient and ultimately disseminated. The additional criminality in the Form 1 offences needs to be reflected in the sentence imposed for the primary offence. 

I will not be specifying a separate sentence for all the matters on the Form 1 but rather take them into account in accordance with s32 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and I do not impose a separate sentence in that respect."" (ROS 36.3 - 37.2)

78Mr Abbas was allowed a discount of 25 percent to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty and was sentenced as follows:

(a) In relation to count 1, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, a term of imprisonment of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.

(b) In relation to count 2, a term of imprisonment of 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months.

The two sentences were partially accumulated with the second sentence commencing 1 year after the commencement of the first sentence. Accordingly, the overall sentence was a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 3 years.

79Counsel for Mr Abbas submitted that the sentencing judge had erred in his treatment of the Form 1 offences when he said:

""The additional criminality in the Form 1 offences needs to be reflected in the sentence imposed for the primary offence.""

80He submitted that by ""reflecting"" the additional criminality of the Form 1 offences in the sentence for count 1, the sentencing judge was in fact punishing Abbas for the Form 1 offences and that this gave rise to error.

81Counsel for Mr Abbas submitted that the correct approach was to treat the Form 1 offences in the same way as courts treat previous convictions, as set out by the plurality (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 477.

""The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind.""

82In support of that submission, counsel for Mr Abbas relied upon the statement by the majority (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) in Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; 212 CLR 629 at [32]:

""32 ... A person who has been convicted of, or admits to, the commission of other offences will, all other things being equal, ordinarily receive a heavier sentence than a person who has previously led a blameless life. Imposing a sentence heavier than otherwise would have been passed is not to sentence the first person again for offences of which he or she was earlier convicted or to sentence that offender for the offences admitted but not charged. It is to do no more than give effect to the well-established principle (in this case established by statute) that the character and antecedents of the offender are, to the extent that they are relevant and known to the sentencing court, to be taken into account in fixing the sentence to be passed. Taking all aspects, both positive and negative, of an offender's known character and antecedents into account in sentencing for an offence is not to punish the offender again for those earlier matters; it is to take proper account of matters which are relevant to fixing the sentence under consideration.""

83Counsel for Mr Abbas relied upon the statement by Sir Igor Judge (as his Lordship then was) in R v Miles [2006] EWCA Crim 256 at [11] where his Honour said:

""As in so many aspects of sentencing, of course, the way in which the court deals with offences to be taken into consideration depends on context. In some cases the offences taken into consideration will end up by adding nothing or nothing very much to the sentence, which the court would otherwise impose. On the other hand, offences taken into consideration may aggravate the sentence and lead to a substantial increase in it. For example, the offences may show a pattern of criminal activity, which suggests careful planning, or deliberate rather than casual involvement in a crime. They may show an offence or offences committed on bail, after an earlier arrest. They may show a return to crime immediately after the offender has been before the court and given a chance that, by committing the crime, he has immediately rejected. There are many situations where similar issues may arise.""

84Counsel for Mr Abbas also relied upon statements concerning offences on a Form 1 by Adams J in Dionys and Calcutt (which were not endorsed by the other two judges in each of those cases). In Dionys Adams J set out the following two paragraphs from Grube:

""36 Many of the 42 offences on the Form 1 involved invasions of residential premises and property stolen was of considerable value. When the court is required to take into account a multiplicity of serious offences, as in this case, it is required to allow for the total criminality revealed by the whole course of the offender's conduct as appropriately reflected in the sentence. If there was, as argued in the present application, a requirement to apply a proportionality or relativity concept, then in some circumstances, including those that arise in the present matter, there would be a risk of the imposition of a penalty that did not adequately reflect the total criminality. The seriousness of such an outcome is apparent for it would potentially, if not actually, tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute in certain cases by mandating a process or approach that produced a manifestly inadequate sentence determined on an unduly narrow or artificial basis.

37 The number and magnitude of the offences in the Form 1 in the present matter, in my opinion, justified the sentence imposed ... which increased the sentence that was appropriate for the principal offence to reflect the total criminality that took place over a considerable period of time arising from so many offences committed over a widespread geographical area in Sydney and beyond. ..."" (R v Grube, Hall J with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed).

85In relation to that statement in Grube, Adams J said in Dionys:

""10 If the italicised phrase is taken to suggest that, in punishing for the substantive charges, the court can punish additionally for the Form 1 charges, in my respectful opinion it is inconsistent with the principle for which AG's Reference No 1 of 2002 stands. The ""total criminality revealed by the offender's conduct"" of course includes all the offences including those on the Form 1. It was necessary, as Hall J explained, for the primary judge to have regard to the ""elements of personal deterrence and retribution in relation to the Form 1 offences"". In my respectful opinion, it is simply not open to punish for the criminality involved in the Form 1 offences, nor to increase the sentence otherwise necessary in respect of the substantive offence to deter the offender from committing offences such as the substantive offence nor to exact retribution for the Form 1 offences. The Form 1 offences inform both the objective nature of the criminality involved in the substantive offence and the subjective features such as remorse and the prospects for rehabilitation and may therefore justify or even require a heavier penalty than would have been imposed had that offence stood alone. But, with respect, that sentence cannot in any sense exact retribution, that is to say, punish, for the Form 1 offences.""

86In Calcutt Adams J said:

""41 I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Latham J in draft. As I understand her Honour, she regards the cocaine charge on the Form 1 as significantly increasing the applicant's criminality and thus as one of the features of the case leading to the conclusion that no lesser sentence is warranted. In Dionys v R [2011] NSWCCA 272 I discussed Re Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. It is unnecessary to repeat here what I there said but I wish to make some additional comments about this issue.

42 Firstly, it is not in issue, of course, that the Form 1 offence must be taken into account. The crucial question concerns the way in which this is to be done. In my respectful view, the sentence for the primary offence can only be increased to take account of a Form 1 offence to the extent that the commission of that offence indicates that

""the need for personal deterrence ... ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged ... [and] the community's entitlement to exact retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed"": Re Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 per Spigelman CJ at [42].

The first consideration is easily appreciated; so far as the second is concerned it must be understood as subject to the fundamental principle that ""the focus throughout must be on sentencing for the primary offence"" (ibid at [43]) and the approach that ""in some senses [semble, in any sense] sentences were being imposed for the Form 1 offences ...[must be] rejected"" (ibid at [45]). The extent to which the second consideration is ""always material in the sentencing process"" gives some guidance as to the way in which it is to be understood. It is, with respect, clear that his Honour was not suggesting that the offender can be punished for uncharged (though admitted) crimes. Rather, the criminality of the primary crime is to be assessed in light of those other offences. The significance of the other offences will vary from case to case but committing an offence in the course of other criminality is, to a greater or lesser degree, more inherently serious than committing that offence in isolation and the measure of retribution is accordingly greater. The other offences may well also be material to the offender's subjective case. Thus, the Form 1 procedure is no more than a convenient and transparent process that allows the uncharged offences to be taken into account to the extent that they reflect on the seriousness of the primary offence and the other factors relevant to assessing the appropriate sentence for that offence and also giving the offender the certainty that he or she will not be further or separately punished for them.

43 Put somewhat differently, I do not accept that the Court intended in Re Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 to qualify in the slightest degree the fundamental principle that a person cannot be punished for offences for which he or she has not been convicted, as the passages to which I have referred demonstrate. Thus, the significance of the Form 1 offences can never be considered in isolation but always and only by assessing their impact on the relevant issues which fall to be considered in sentencing for the primary offence and for that offence alone. Those issues are not expanded, though of course they might well be informed, by the commission of the Form 1 offence. I therefore respectfully disagree with interpretations of Re Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 that give to the reference to retribution the effect, in substance if not in form, that directly or indirectly subverts the fundamental principle to which I have referred.

44 In the present case, therefore, I formed the view that, although the cocaine offence is a serious one, it does not significantly increase the need for personal deterrence to a greater degree that otherwise is the case considering the criminality involved in the primary offence. Nor does it seem to me to add any significant weight to the measure of criminality involved in that offence.""

87Counsel for Mr Abbas submitted that not only were those statements of principle, particularly by Adams J, consistent with the Act but they were also fully consistent with the analysis by Spigelman CJ in the guideline judgment.

88Senior counsel for Mr Amoun did not go so far in his submissions. He submitted that the error in the sentencing judge's approach was that the words ""the additional criminality in the Form 1 needs to be reflected in the sentence imposed for the primary offence"", were inconsistent with the preceding paragraphs which were consistent with the guideline judgment. The error in the sentencing judge's approach, he submitted, was that the words ""reflected in the sentence"" indicated that he was sentencing for the Form 1 offences. He submitted that if the words used by the sentencing judge meant that the additional criminality in relation to the Form 1 offences needed to be reflected in itself in the sentence being imposed, that constituted error and was inconsistent with the guideline judgment. Senior counsel for Mr Amoun, however, was prepared to accept that in par [42] of the guideline judgment the reference to ""the community's entitlement to expect retribution for serious offences"" was a reference to ""serious offences"" on the Form 1. In that respect, he differed from the submissions put on behalf of Mr Abbas.

89Senior counsel for Mr Amoun submitted that the reference to the ""principle of totality"" at the end of [42] of the guideline judgment, should be read as a reference to the principle of proportionality. He submitted that this meant that the sentencing judge could not impose a sentence that was longer than that which was capable of being proportional to the criminality in the principal offence. He accepted that such an approach was inconsistent with the decision in Grube.

Consideration

90The start point for the issue raised by these grounds of appeal is the statute. It applies to proceedings for an offence where the Prosecutor files in court a document which specifies other offences with which the offender has been charged, but not convicted (s32). Section 33 relevantly provides:

""33(1) When dealing with the offender for the principal offence, the Court is to ask the offender whether the offender wants the court to take any further offences into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence.

(2) The court may take a further offence into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence:

(a) If the offender:

(i) admits guilt to the further offence, and

(ii) indicates that the offender wants the court to take the further offence into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence; and

...

(3) If the court takes a further offence into account, the penalty imposed on the offender for the principal offence must not exceed the maximum penalty that the court could have imposed for the principal offence had the further offence not been taken into account.""

91The phrase ""take into account"" is used in the statute in a way which leaves open a wide range of factors, including the weight to be given to a particular matter, and how it may be taken into account in a particular case. What the statute makes clear is that Parliament has imposed little constraint on how the court will take the Form 1 offence or offences, into account. It follows, therefore, that the statutory construction is not to be read down by glosses and language from particular cases. What the guideline judgment makes clear is that the court was unwilling to impose the sort of restrictions which were sought by the Attorney-General, but otherwise left at large how the offences on the Form 1 were to be treated.

92Support for that approach can be found in Weininger, where the majority considered the phrase in s16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (C'th) which obliged a court sentencing a federal offender ""to take into account"" such matters ""as are relevant and known to the court"". At [20] the majority said:

""20 ... Although s16A(2)(a) requires a sentencing judge to take account of the nature and circumstances of the offence, that requirement is not absolute. They are to be taken into account only to the extent that they are relevant and known to the court.""

93It is clear from other passages in the majority judgment, including [32] upon which counsel for Mr Abbas relied, that the phrase ""to take into account"" in s16A(2) was applied in a very broad way without significant qualification.

94At the very least, a statutory requirement or permission to ""take [a matter] into account"" requires that ""attention [be paid to it] in the course of [the] intellectual process"" (Metropolitan Water Board v Assessment Committee of the Metropolitan Burrough of St Marylebone (1923) 1 KB 86 at 99). Once s33 of the Act is engaged, it operates upon the court in ""dealing with the offender"". In this case the relevant ""dealing"" was the imposition of a sentence.

95As indicated, nothing in the express text of the statute purports to limit, in the manner contended for by the applicants, the way in which the sentencing judge was able to ""take into account"" the Form 1 offences. That is not the end of the analysis as consideration also needs to be given to established principles concerning the imposition of sentences. It is in that context that the guideline judgment becomes important. The guideline judgment did not purport to, nor did it exhaustively analyse the phrase ""to take into account"", as used in the Act. It did, however, by reference to sentencing principles, establish a number of propositions which are helpful when seeking to apply that phrase.

96In general terms, it approved an approach which focused on the principal offence (the one on the indictment) and sentenced for that offence on the basis of an ""instinctive synthesis"" of factors, including the amount of increase in penalty due because a Form 1 was involved. In other words, it held that sentencing for matters involving a Form 1 called for a principal offence based approach in which the penalty is increased because of the use of the Form 1 procedure.

97The guideline judgment made the following points:

""18 A number of propositions with respect to the process of taking into account matters on a Form 1 are well established and are uncontroversial. First, the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence (or to alter the nature of the sentence) than would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone. Secondly, it is wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small. Sometimes it will be substantial. 

...

23 The Court must, of course, give effect to the statutory regime. However, it does so in a context in which the basic principle of the common law is that no-one should be punished for an offence of which he or she has not been convicted. (R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 at 389, 395-396; R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [18].) The offences on a Form 1 constitute an admission of guilt, but there is no conviction.

24 The 'top down' approach which, notionally, identifies an appropriate penalty for the full gamut of offences, appears to me to be inconsistent with this principle. No doubt it can be said that even the 'bottom up"" approach involves, in a sense, punishment 'for' the Form 1 offences, because the penalty for the primary offence is increased. 

...

29 I do not understand Wood CJ at CL's reference in Bavadra to the ""totality of criminality"" to suggest that a sentencing judge should determine sentences for all the offences before the judge, whether on the indictment or on the Form 1. I understand his Honour to have intended no more than the proposition for which Simpson J referred to Bavadra as authority in R v Harris (2001) 125 A Crim R 27 at 31 [23] that a sentencing judge ""... should give due recognition to the gravity of those offences"". If, contrary to my understanding, the reference in Bavadra was intended to suggest that a sentencing judge was imposing punishment for the Form 1 offences, I would respectfully disagree that this is permissible under the statute. The focus, as I will show below, must be on ""the principal offence"" alone.

...

35 The starting point of the analysis must be the terms of the statutory power. In my opinion, the power is inconsistent with the 'top down' approach proposed in the Attorney's submissions, as quoted above. The statutory scheme, like its common law predecessor (analysed most comprehensively by Neasey J in R v Jones (esp at 131-133)) emphasises that the court is concerned and concerned only with imposing a sentence for ""the principal offence"".

...

· By s33(3) the fact that the Court is only sentencing for the principal offence is confirmed by the restriction that the court cannot impose a sentence greater than the maximum penalty for the principal offence.

...

42 The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another.

43 I did not intend these observations to be exhaustive of the elements upon which the fact of other offences may impinge. However, no additional elements for which that could be so have been identified in submissions to this Court. The important point is that the focus throughout must be on sentencing for the primary offence.

44 The manner and degree to which the Form 1 offences can impinge upon elements relevant to sentencing for the principal offence will depend on a range of other factors pertinent to those elements and the weight to be given to them in the overall sentencing task. For that reason it will rarely be appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect on the sentence of taking into account Form 1 offences.""

98It follows from the final dot point in [35] and second last sentence in [42] of the guideline judgment that the proportionality argument put forward by senior counsel for Mr Amoun is contrary to the guideline judgment. In that respect, the ultimate conclusion in Grube, when rejecting the proportionality submission raised in that case, is fully consistent with the guideline judgment. Since senior counsel for Mr Amoun did not challenge the correctness of the guideline judgment that part of his submissions should be rejected.

99It is then necessary to consider the primary submission by counsel for Messrs Abbas, Amoun and Bodiotis that it is an error to take into account the criminality of the Form 1 offences when sentencing for the principal offence. The effect of their submissions is that to do so, is to ""punish"" for the Form 1 offences, which is contrary to sentencing principles, i.e. to punish for offences of which a person has not been convicted. In accordance with that approach and in order to give the Form 1 procedure some substance, counsel for Mr Abbas submitted that Form 1 offences should be treated in an analogous way to previous offences, as discussed in Veen No 2.

100That submission should be rejected. As a start point, there is no authorisation for such a restriction in the statute. Such an approach is inconsistent with [42] - [44] of the guideline judgment. Apart from the express reference therein to personal deterrence, the reference to the extraction of ""retribution for serious offences"" can only be a reference to the offences on the Form 1 being offences ""for which no punishment has in fact been imposed"".

101The attempt to support the submission by reference to what was said by the majority in Weininger at [32] is misconceived. As already indicated, the approach of the majority to the phrase ""take into account"" is broad with little by way of qualification. At [32] the majority was not seeking to state a principle with general application, but was doing no more than providing an illustration of how the particular statement of facts in that case could be used by reference to sentencing principles. Weininger does not assist, other than by confirming the broad application of the phrase ""take into account"".

102This leaves for consideration the point relied upon by all three applicants that to take into account the criminality of the Form 1 offences and as a result, to increase the sentence for the principal offence, is to punish for the Form 1 offences. This, so the submission proceeds, cannot be correct because a fundamental consideration when applying sentencing principles, is that ""no one should be punished for an offence of which he or she has not been convicted"" (R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270).

103The difficulty with the submission is that it is largely based on semantics, i.e. the use of the word ""punish"", and it fails to have regard to the words of the statute, the effect of the guideline judgment and the purpose of the statute.

104As Spigelman CJ noted in the guideline judgment at [24], as a matter of semantics it can be said that any increase in the sentence imposed for the principal offence by reference to Form 1 offences, could be characterised as punishment ""for"" the Form 1 offences. Such an approach, however, gives too broad a meaning to the concept of ""punish"" and would apply to any increase in the sentence for the principal offence based on the Form 1 offences. To follow such an approach, would defeat ""the entire point of the [Form 1] process"" (guideline judgment [18]).

105What the guideline judgment makes clear is that no analysis of each offence on the Form 1 is to be carried out for the purpose of sentencing for that offence as one would if the offence was included on the indictment. That is what would occur on the ""top-down"" approach, which was expressly rejected. As the guideline judgment made clear, however, regard can be had in a general way to factors associated with the Form 1 offences, including their criminality when sentencing for the primary offence.

106As the statute and the guideline judgment make clear, the point of the Form 1 process is to increase the sentence for the primary offence by taking into account the offences on the Form 1. The advantage for the State is that offences are finalised, but the fact that their commission has been admitted by the offender is taken account of when he or she is sentenced for the principal offence. The advantage for the offender is that he or she is not sentenced for the Form 1 offences, nor ""punished"" for them, even though they are ""taken into account"" in relation to the primary offence for which he or she is sentenced. The end result for the offender is a sentence which is less than if he or she were sentenced for all of the offences and the offender emerges from the process with a ""clean slate"". The guideline judgment provided direction for how that process was to be implemented.

107It follows from the above analysis that the sentencing judge did not err in the way in which he approached the offences on the Form 1 in relation to Mr Abbas. Having summarised the effect of par [42] of the guideline judgment, his Honour ""took into account"" the Form 1 offences and increased the sentence for the principal offence accordingly.

108The grounds of appeal relating to the Form 1 in the applications of Messrs Abbas, Amoun and Bodiotis should be dismissed.

109Otherwise I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Garling J with respect to the other Grounds of Appeal of Messrs Abbas, Amoun and Bodiotis and Taleb.

110GARLING J: Four applicants, Mohammad Abbas, Khaled Taleb, Con Bodiotis and Ghassan Amoun each seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on them in the District Court of NSW by Zahra SC DCJ between October 2011 and March 2012. 

111Each of the applicants relies upon separate grounds for their application. It will be necessary to consider their applications separately. However, each of the applications raises some common issues of fact and, importantly, except for Taleb, each application raises a common ground dealing with the proper application of the Form 1 scheme described in Part 3, Division 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It was because of the commonality of these issues of fact and law that the applications were heard together.

112Each of the applicants pleaded guilty to one or more offences relating to dealing in drugs. Except for Taleb, each of the applicants also asked the sentencing Judge to take into account other offences on a Form 1, pursuant to s 32(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 

113As will become apparent, the drug offences all occurred at the direction, and under the control, of Bassam Hamzy, an individual who, at the relevant time, was a prisoner in Lithgow Correctional Centre, who conducted his criminal activities whilst in custody. 

114Hamzy's activities, which involved each of the applicants, relevantly consisted of six transactions of the sale and supply of drugs. It is convenient to summarise each transaction, and identify the applicants involved, and their roles. 

Transaction 1 - 500gms Methylamphetamine
115Transaction 1 which took place between 7 and 10 May 2008, involved Abbas, Bodiotis and Amoun. 

116Bodiotis was the purchaser of 500gms of methylamphetamine at a cost of $120,000. He was located in Melbourne. 

117Hamzy contacted Abbas and told him that he was to organise all of the steps necessary to supply Bodiotis with the drugs. Hamzy then organised with Amoun to source the drugs at the price agreed. 

118On 8 April 2008, OS1, a member of Hamzy's criminal enterprise, drove a truck in which the drugs were contained to Melbourne. OS1 delivered the drugs to Bodiotis and received part payment from him. The driver contacted Abbas to record that he had received part payment for the supply of the drugs. This was then relayed back to Hamzy, who arranged for Amoun to travel on 9 May 2008 from Sydney to Melbourne to collect the outstanding amount. Amoun was able to collect a further sum of $51,000 for the payment of the drugs, which left $44,000 outstanding.

119On 10 May 2008, Abbas, Amoun and Hamzy discussed the collection of the outstanding money from Bodiotis. Abbas was instructed to visit Bodiotis and obtain the balance of the monies from him. 

Transaction 2 - 372gms of Methylamphetamine
120This transaction involved Abbas and Amoun. 

121On 17 May 2008, Abbas provided to Hamzy the name and contact details of a potential purchaser of drugs, Imran Allouche, who was located in Melbourne. Abbas had agreed to supply Allouche with a quantity of methylamphetamine. 

122Hamzy directed Amoun to source the methylamphetamine and provide it to OS1 who was to transport the drugs to Melbourne. Amoun did so.

123On 18 May 2008, whilst the drugs were being transported to Melbourne, Abbas was involved in further discussions about effecting the delivery of the drugs, and potential future supply. 

Transaction 3 - 284gms Methylamphetamine
124This transaction involved Abbas, Bodiotis and Amoun, and took place on 11 and 12 May 2008. 

125The purchaser of these drugs was Khaled Chkhaidem, a resident of Melbourne. Over the period of this transaction, namely 11 and 12 May 2008, police intercepted calls between Hamzy, Abbas and Chkhaidem dealing with the purchase by Chkhaidem of the methylamphetamine. Hamzy made arrangements with Amoun to procure the drugs for supply to Chkhaidem. The methylamphetamine was to be sold for $68,000. 

126On the evening of 11 May 2008, Amoun obtained the drugs and supplied them to OS1 for transport to Melbourne. 

127In order to ensure the successful completion of the transaction, Amoun flew to Melbourne and met with OS1 and Chkhaidem. However, there was apparently a misunderstanding about the nature of the drugs which Chkhaidem wanted. He was not interested in the methylamphetamine. 

128Consequently, at the direction of Hamzy conveyed over the telephone from Lithgow gaol, Amoun arranged for the drugs to be purchased by Bodiotis. Amoun and OS1 then effected delivery of the drugs to Bodiotis and agreed arrangements with him about payment for the drugs. 

Transaction 4 - 2,500 tablets of MDMA
129This transaction involved Abbas, Bodiotis and Amoun. 

130The transaction was carried out at the same time as the supply of methylamphetamine referred to in the previous transaction. The arrangements for the supply followed the same steps as with the previous transaction except that Chkhaidem was not involved. The sum of money involved was about $10,000. 

Transaction 5 - 182gms of Methylamphetamine
131This transaction involved Taleb and Bodiotis. It occurred in the period from 5 June 2008 to 6 June 2008.

132Bodiotis, by contacting Hamzy, sought the supply of a quantity of methylamphetamine. Bodiotis suggested, and Hamzy agreed that Taleb would travel by plane to Sydney from Melbourne to collect the drugs in Sydney and then deliver the drugs to Bodiotis in Melbourne.

133There was some difficulty with the supply of the drugs, and although Taleb had flown to Sydney, members of Hamzy's criminal enterprise were not able to supply the drugs to him promptly. 

134Although Taleb had not intended to remain in Sydney, the difficulties with the supply of the drugs meant that rather than returning to Melbourne on the last evening flight, he remained in Sydney. Early on the morning of 6 June 2008, Taleb, with the assistance of arrangements made by members of Hamzy's criminal enterprise, departed Sydney by road carrying the drugs, and returned to Melbourne where he arranged by telephone to meet Bodiotis. Bodiotis then communicated with Hamzy about the quality of the drugs which had been supplied, and the fact that the quantity did not meet his requirements. 

135Ultimately this dispute was resolved when Hamzy and Bodiotis renegotiated the price to be paid for the drugs which were delivered.

Transaction 6 - 995gms of Methylamphetamine
136This transaction involved only Bodiotis and no other applicants. It took place in the period between 8 and 14 June 2008. 

137On 9 June 2008, Hamzy spoke to Bodiotis agreeing to supply him with a quantity of methylamphetamine. The drugs were transported from Sydney to Melbourne by truck. The quantity transported exceeded that ordered by Bodiotis.

138On the evening of 11 June 2008, OS1 had a conversation with another participant in the criminal enterprise who informed him that Bodiotis may wish to purchase the remaining quantity of methylamphetamine, which amounted to 884gms. A further conversation took place in which Bodiotis offered to purchase the drugs from OS1. This additional supply and purchase was approved by Hamzy and, during the evening of 11 June 2008, Bodiotis took possession of the drugs. He paid a total of $191,000.

139Ultimately, Bodiotis paid the balance of the funds owing on 14 June 2008.

140As well as the six principal transactions, there were various other offences which related only to one of the applicants. It will be convenient to deal with these when considering the applicant's individual application.

142Abbas asked the sentencing judge to take into account four offences on a Form 1, two of which related to the involvement of Abbas in Transactions 3 and 4 respectively.

143There was one further charge on the Form 1, under s 25(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act, which involved an agreement to supply 56gm of cocaine. Although Abbas agreed to the supply, it did not ultimately proceed.

144The fourth charge on the Form 1 was one of participation in a criminal group knowing that his participation contributed to criminal activity, contrary to s 93T(1) of the Crimes Act. That offence carried a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. The criminal group involved was that of Bassam Hamzy. Abbas, in addition to the drug supply transaction, participated in the criminal group by purchasing a $100 telephone recharge for the contraband mobile telephone being used by Hamzy to organise the drug supply operations of the group.

Taleb
145Khaled Taleb pleaded guilty to one charge of supplying an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug. On 20 October 2011 Zahra SC DCJ sentenced Taleb as follows:

In passing sentence for this offence, the Court took into account, on a Form 1, offences under s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and ss 25(2) and 27 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 involving Transaction 4.

148Bodiotis asked that the sentencing judge take into consideration the three further offences which were placed on the Form 1. Two of these concerned knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act. These offences carry a maximum penalty of fifteen years imprisonment. The amounts of money involved were, respectively, $31,400 and $132,000. These proceeds were related to the drug transactions earlier described.

149The third offence being placed on the Form 1 involved Bodiotis' involvement in Transaction 4.

Applications for Leave - Form 1 Ground
152Each of the applicants, except Taleb, included a ground in identical form dealing with the way in which a sentencing Judge ought properly apply sentencing principles to the principal offence where there are other offences included on a Form 1.

153The ground is in the following common form:

""His Honour erred in increasing the sentence ... in order to reflect the additional criminality of the Form 1 offences"".

154I gratefully adopt the summary of the legislation and the authorities set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice. I entirely agree with his reasons for rejecting the arguments advanced with respect to the Form 1 ground. 

155I also agree generally with the additional observations of Hoeben CJ at CL.

156It is now necessary to deal with the remaining applications and the remaining grounds relied upon for leave to appeal.

Application - Abbas
157Abbas sought leave to appeal upon the following additional grounds:

(1)...

(2)The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in light of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender Con Bodiotis.

(3)The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

Grounds 2 and 3
158It will be convenient to deal with these grounds together. Ground 3 raises a question of manifest excess, and Ground 2, a question of parity with respect to the applicant, Bodiotis.

159It is not generally appropriate, or necessary, to consider any question of parity in circumstances such as these, unless the Court is satisfied that the sentence is, in all other respects, within an appropriate range and not manifestly excessive. 

160Abbas pleaded guilty to two counts of engaging in the supply of a quantity of methylamphetamine which, in each case, was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that drug. As is apparent from the discussion of Ground 1, the sentencing Judge was asked to take into account four other offences on the Form 1.

161The two counts to which Abbas pleaded were laid under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, and carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

162The sentencing Judge was satisfied that Abbas' role in relation to Count 1 included sourcing Bodiotis as a prospective purchaser, and facilitating contact with Hamzy in order that Bodiotis could negotiate with Hamzy and arrange for the payment of the drug. 

163It is clear that in so doing, Abbas held himself out, and viewed himself, as being an independent middleman, operating as a conduit at a significant level, bringing together people involved in transacting the supply of substantial quantities of prohibited drugs.

164Although Abbas was not present, and did not participate in the actual supply of and payment for the drugs, he was nevertheless an essential part of the transaction.

165In relation to the second count (Transaction 2), Abbas' role was limited to the provision of the telephone number of the purchaser to Hamzy. He did not handle, package or otherwise involve himself in the negotiation for the supply of the drugs. Again, Abbas connected the purchaser, Allouche, to the supplier, Hamzy, and remained in contact with OS1 during the course of the supply. He kept abreast of the progress of the supply. Abbas' role was crucial to, and precipitated, the supply. 

166The sentencing Judge concluded that Abbas' role in the overall offending was a substantial one. He noted that the enterprise involved a substantial trafficking in drugs involving syndicate members in both NSW and Victoria, and that the principal, Hamzy, relied on people such as Abbas to operate the syndicate. He concluded that Abbas was an indispensable figure in the overall supply. The sentencing Judge was satisfied that the acts of Abbas made his offending objectively serious.

167The sentencing Judge considered the various subjective factors which applied to Abbas. He accepted Abbas' evidence that he was in fear of Hamzy, but rejected any suggestion that he was acting under duress. He concluded that Abbas' communications with Hamzy indicated that Abbas was knowingly providing valuable assistance to Hamzy and, ultimately, significantly assisting in the supply of drugs. 

168The sentencing Judge noted that Abbas had only a minor record of prior criminal offending which could, in effect, be put to one side except for any question of the assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation.

169The sentencing Judge noted that Abbas had shown remorse, and he concluded, having taken into account expert opinion, that Abbas had good prospects of rehabilitation.

170The sentencing Judge further noted that Abbas was entitled to a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian benefit of his plea of guilty which was entered at the first available opportunity.

171As well, the sentencing Judge was satisfied that by reason of significant symptoms of schizophrenia which Abbas had manifested in more recent times whilst in custody, his incarceration was likely to be more onerous, and he took that into account.

172It was submitted to the sentencing Judge that exceptional circumstances existed such as to warrant a non-custodial sentence. His Honour rejected that view, and declined to find that there were exceptional circumstances of the kind necessary to warrant a non-custodial sentence. That finding was not challenged before this Court.

173I am not satisfied that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. This Court has said on many occasions, that it is necessary to ensure that those who engage, and play an important part, in the supply of illegal drugs are subjected to a sentence which has a significant element of general deterrence. 

174The maximum penalties for the offences to which Abbas pleaded guilty, and the standard non-parole periods which are fixed by the Legislature, are guideposts which are relevant to be taken into account in the assessment of an appropriate sentence: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27]. 

175There is nothing about the sentences that were ultimately imposed, including the period of accumulation, which would justify a conclusion that these sentences were manifestly excessive. In my opinion, the sentences were entirely within the discretion which the sentencing Judge had. 

176It is necessary then to consider the question of parity with respect to the sentences imposed on the applicant, Bodiotis. It will be observed that the first count with respect to Abbas and Bodiotis were for the same offence. The head sentence for Abbas was 7 years and for Bodiotis, 5 years. The non-parole period on these counts were 4 years for Abbas and 3 years for Bodiotis. 

177However, Bodiotis did not ask the sentencing Judge to take into account the offences on a Form 1 with respect to his sentencing on this count. 

178As well, Bodiotis pleaded guilty to four counts of dealing in drugs and asked for three other offences to be taken into account on a Form 1. Accordingly, the sentencing Judge in Bodiotis' case needed to consider the principle of totality when considering the overall length of the sentences to be applied with respect to Bodiotis, and how each sentence within that matrix should be determined. 

179In considering whether the principle of parity justifies interference with an existing sentence, a court needs to be satisfied that the discrepancy identified is one which is ""marked"", or ""clearly unjustifiable"" or ""manifest ... such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance"", or else that it ""[appears] that justice has not been done"": Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610, 613 and 623-624; Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26, (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301, and 323 and 338; R v Toudevin [1996] 2 VR 402 at 403; DGM v R [2006] NSWCCA 296 at [46]; Green at [31] and at [105].

180Although a simple comparison of the sentences imposed with respect to Count 1 would suggest that Abbas was treated less favourably than Bodiotis, I am not satisfied that this has given rise to a discrepancy which would justify this Court intervening in the sentences imposed. 

181The sentencing picture presented by each of Abbas and Bodiotis to the sentencing Judge was different. The overall criminality was different, questions of totality assumed different proportions, and there is no basis upon which, in my opinion, Abbas could have any justifiable sense of grievance. 

182This is particularly so when one considers that the sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge on Abbas for Count 1, included references to offences on Form1 which, for the reasons which have been earlier discussed, justify a court imposing a heavier sentence than would otherwise have been imposed. 

183I propose that Abbas' application for leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal should be dismissed.

Application - Taleb
184Taleb's application for leave to appeal relies upon the following grounds:

(1)The learned sentencing Judge erred in relation to the offender's role, the assessment of the objective seriousness of his offending conduct, and the level of criminality of his conduct. 

(2)The learned sentencing Judge erred in that he did not properly consider issues of parity between the sentence of Bodiotis and the applicant.

(3)The learned sentencing Judge erred in his assessment of the degree of hardship his imprisonment would cause to his family.

(4)The sentence was manifestly excessive.

185With respect to the count for which he was convicted, Taleb was sentencing to 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years. Although there was a further charge which the Court dealt with under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, that sentence is no longer relevant and was not subject to any appeal. 

186The sentencing Judge held that Taleb's role in the overall enterprise of drug supply being conducted by Hamzy was a limited one. He was not involved in negotiations or planning concerning the supply, nor was he involved in procuring the drug. 

187The sentencing Judge was satisfied that Taleb was at all times acting at the direction of others, and that he was tasked with collecting the drug in Sydney and delivering to Bodiotis. He was motivated by financial gain and the sentencing Judge identified Taleb's role as a courier of the drug, but concluded that this was a significant role which was crucial to the supply of a significant quantity of drug from Hamzy to Bodiotis. There is nothing erroneous about these findings. They were well open to the sentencing Judges. 

188The sentencing Judge noted that Taleb had pleaded guilty, and allowed a discount of 25% for the utilitarian benefit of that plea. He also noted that Taleb had expressed significant remorse about his conduct, and despair over his being involved. 

189Taleb had a previous criminal history, but it did not involve supply of prohibited drugs, and the sentencing Judge concluded that, although there were a number of convictions on Taleb's past criminal history, it could not be said that it was a substantial history. However, the sentencing Judge was unable to conclude anything positive about Taleb's prospects of rehabilitation. He noted that because this was Taleb's first term of imprisonment, it would be likely to deter him from offending in the future.

190The sentencing Judge took into account the hardship which Taleb's family would suffer as a consequence of his imprisonment, and took into account that Taleb was from Victoria and, accordingly, would be serving his sentence outside the State. He clearly accorded it some weight. It is not possible to conclude that he placed too little weight on it so as to constitute an error. 

191The trial Judge's remarks on sentence reflect a careful consideration of all of the elements relevant to the sentence of Taleb. He gave careful consideration to the question of objective seriousness, of his participation in the crime and to all of his subjective factors. He took them all into account. With the exception of the plea of guilty to which he attributed a 25% discount, the sentencing Judge did not separately assess the weight to be attributed to each factor. In approaching the matter in this way, his Honour did not fall into any appellable error. 

192I do not consider that any of the grounds set out in paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this application for leave to appeal give rise any arguable ground of appeal.

193The sentence imposed was well within the sentencing Judge's discretion. Complaints about weight are not matters to which this Court should have regard in the absence of a conclusion that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Here it was not.

194Ground 2 raises the question of parity with Bodiotis. The equivalent charge with Bodiotis was Count 3. On Count 3, Bodiotis was sentenced to a fixed term of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment. In other words, the non-parole period of Taleb was 6 months shorter than the effective non-parole period, albeit a fixed sentence, imposed upon Bodiotis. Taleb points to the different roles which he and Bodiotis bore in the enterprise, and submitted that his role was significantly less than Bodiotis, such as would require a greater differential in the penalty imposed.

195It is important to keep in mind that Bodiotis was facing a far more complex sentencing exercise by the sentencing Judge than was Taleb. In particular, the sentencing Judge in sentencing Bodiotis, had to take into account the principle of totality, and to fix a maximum term of imprisonment and a non parole period which reflected his overall criminality. 

196There was a difference between the penalties imposed. Effectively, this was 6 months with respect to the time served in custody. Since a balance of term was not fixed for Bodiotis with respect to this count, it is not possible to undertake a direct comparison between the sentence imposed on Taleb and that imposed on Bodiotis. 

197Nevertheless, having regard to the effective sentences which were imposed, I am not satisfied that Taleb could have any sense of grievance about the differences in penalties. Bodiotis was more criminally involved than Taleb, and received a longer sentence.

198I would not favour upholding this ground of appeal.

199I propose that leave be granted to Taleb, but that the appeal should be dismissed.

Application - Bodiotis
200Bodiotis seeks leave to appeal upon the following additional grounds:

""1. That the lower court erred in finding that it was 'unable to make any meaningful prediction as to the offender's prospects of rehabilitation'.

2. The applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance arising from the disparity of sentence with the co-offender OS1.

3. The sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence that was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances.""

During the hearing, Bodiotis, by leave, added the Form 1 ground in the same terms as Abbas.

201The sentencing Judge accepted evidence that Mr Bodiotis made a financial gain from his dealing in the drugs, but did so in a context where he kept some drugs for personal consumption and used the money which he obtained to support his gambling addiction. 

202He noted that the offences had been committed whilst Bodiotis was serving a sentence of imprisonment which had been suspended. That sentence was on account of a conviction on counts of perjury and one count of obtaining financial advantage by deception. The sentencing Judge held that this factor was a serious aggravating one. 

203The sentencing Judge determined that Bodiotis was not a part of Hamzy's criminal syndicate, but was rather a purchaser of drugs from Hamzy and those involved in his syndicate.

204His Honour determined that there was no evidence to suggest that there was any connection between Hamzy and those involved in the sourcing and supply of drugs, and Bodiotis, save that he was the purchaser of drugs from that syndicate. His Honour also concluded, as was clear from the pleas of guilty, that Bodiotis then on-sold the drugs which were delivered to him in Melbourne. The sentencing Judge noted that there were no indicia that Bodiotis had gained wealth from the supply of prohibited drugs, but rather that the evidence indicated he was at the time of his arrest residing with his mother, taking care of her, and in receipt of a carer's allowance.

205Ultimately, he concluded that the culpability of Bodiotis was of a high order. He obtained considerable quantities of prohibited drugs over a number of weeks, and the sentencing Judge identified the fact that the potential harm to the community was substantial and that, accordingly, the criminality involved called for sentences which imposed a strong element of deterrence.

206Having observed Bodiotis give evidence, the sentencing Judge concluded that his remorse was genuine, and that he had insight into his offending. He concluded that, with continuing treatment whilst in custody, his potential for re-offending would be significantly reduced.

207Of his prospects for rehabilitation, his Honour said this:

""The psychologist expresses the opinion that, insofar as the offender's prognosis is concerned, the offender 'is a reasonably intelligent man who has the potential to be many things if he can change the course of his life'. The offender's progress is largely dependent, the psychologist notes, on the offender's ability to maintain control over his substance use and gambling. The psychologist notes if the offender were not able to maintain such control 'the risk of offending behaviour in some form would remain significant'. 

The psychologist is of the view that the offender's prognosis is at best guarded, particularly against a background of a chronic pattern of gambling and prior offending, and the connection between his substance abuse and his offending here.

...

The psychologist noted that the offender indicated a willingness to participate in further rehabilitation programs either by way of intensive pre-release programs or by entering a residential drug rehabilitation program. The psychologist recommends that the offender use his time in custody involving himself in intensive alcohol and other drug treatment and also in completing vocational programs aimed at ensuring future productive employment.""

208His Honour went on to conclude that he was unable, on the totality of the material before him, to make any meaningful prediction as to the offender's prospects of rehabilitation. 

209This conclusion appears, from his Honour's remarks, to take into account all that the psychologist has said, the fact that the psychologist's prognosis was a guarded one, the subjective background of Bodiotis, including his involvement in significant criminal conduct, the fact that he was at that time on conditional liberty, and the fact that he had a history of prior convictions.

210It is not essential that a judge come to a positive conclusion about prospects of rehabilitation in every case. A judge's conclusion on that issue will depend upon the evidence led. It is a matter of mitigation for a Judge to take into account that an offender has good prospects of rehabilitation: s 21A(3)(h) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. The onus falls on an offender to satisfy a judge that he or she has good prospects of rehabilitation. 

211What has here occurred, is that the sentencing Judge has not been persuaded by the material before him that Bodiotis has good prospects of rehabilitation. In those circumstances, whilst keeping in mind the progress that Bodiotis has made, the sentencing Judge has failed to be persuaded that he should find that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. There is no error in the reasoning process of the sentencing Judge, and the conclusion was one which was well open to him, having regard to all of the matters to which reference has just been made. 

212The psychologist gave a guarded prognosis. The past history of behaviour of Bodiotis did not give the sentencing Judge any sense of confidence that Bodiotis would rehabilitate himself, and he was a man who continued to be afflicted with both a drug and gambling addiction. The conclusion of the sentencing Judge was well open, and I would not uphold Ground 1.

213Grounds 2 and 3 can be considered together since they involve questions of manifest excess and questions of parity. 

214Overall, Bodiotis received an effective sentence of imprisonment of 9 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months. The offences carried maximum penalties of 15 years or 20 years. The course of the drug dealing occupied different and repeated occasions, and over an extended period of time. A significant motivation for the drug dealing was financial gain, although in the context of attempting to cope with drug and gambling addictions.

215In considering questions of parity, the sentencing Judge was directed to the sentence which was imposed on OS1, the truck driver who had been involved in the transport of the drugs with respect to various of the counts on the indictment affecting Bodiotis. 

216The sentencing Judge described OS1's criminality and distinguished that from the criminality of Bodiotis, and concluded that issues concerning parity ""... had relatively limited application"". 

217Of particular concern to the sentencing Judge was the fact that Bodiotis had been in custody for over two and a half years prior to his sentence being imposed. However, he backdated the sentence to take account of the entirety of the period spent in custody. 

218As I have earlier remarked, the conduct of Bodiotis extended over a significant period, involved a number of separate counts of engaging in drug supply transactions and involving drugs of significant weight, and the applicant engaged over time in a course of criminal conduct of significant seriousness with potential to cause great harm.

219The sentencing Judge paid careful attention to the all of the relevant factors which he was obliged to take into account, and to which he was entitled to have regard. The sentences imposed on the individual counts were, and the overall effective sentence was, well within the sentencing Judge's discretion. I am not persuaded that there is any manifest excess about the sentences that have been imposed.

220The submissions on parity called up the specific case of OS1. OS1 presented a complex sentencing picture for the sentencing Judge in that case. But there are significant differences between the criminality upon which OS1 and Bodiotis were being sentenced. 

221Firstly, OS1 was being sentenced for different offences, some of which had nothing to do with the course of conduct of being involved in the supply of drugs. Secondly, the role that OS1 played and his criminality in the Hamzy syndicate, were different from those of Bodiotis. Thirdly, OS1 received a significant discount for his plea of guilty and the provision of assistance to authorities. Necessarily, he presented different subjective considerations, particularly with respect to contrition and prospects of rehabilitation, than did Bodiotis. 

222The mere fact that the charges are different as between OS1 and Bodiotis, does not mean that a question of parity is incapable of arising. On the other hand, the fact that the charges are different and the circumstances are different provides a ready explanation as to why there might be a differential in the sentences.

223Without regard to the discount which OS1 obtained for his plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities, the effective starting point for the total sentence for OS1 was 20 years imprisonment. The effective starting point for the applicant Bodiotis, excluding any discount for his plea of guilty, was 12 years and 4 months imprisonment. This differential is adequately explained by the difference in criminality between the two. The criminality in which OS1 was involved was more significant, and the offences carried longer penalties. However, the question remains whether the offender is entitled reasonably to have a legitimate sense of grievance.

224I fail to see that there is any comparison at all to be drawn between the sentences for OS1 and Bodiotis. Their participation in the offences was different, their criminality was different, the charges with which they came before the Court were significantly different, and in my opinion, there is no room for a comparison between the two. 

225As well, their subjective cases were significantly different. 

226I would not uphold the application for leave to appeal on the ground that Bodiotis could have any justifiable sense of grievance by reason of the imposition of a different sentence on OS1. 

227I propose that this application for leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed. 

Application - Amoun
228Amoun applies for leave to appeal on the following additional grounds:

(1)His Honour failed to give the applicant an adequate discount for his assistance to authorities.

(2)His Honour erred in his assessment of, and gave inadequate weight to duress, the influence of his older brother and their significance to an assessment of the applicant's offending.

Ground 2
229It is convenient to deal first with Ground 2. The applicant, Amoun, is the younger brother of Hamzy. He was one of a number of members of Hamzy's family involved in this criminal syndicate. His father was involved, together with his older brother, and his two cousins. There were other associates. 

230Before the sentencing Judge, counsel for Amoun submitted that Amoun had committed the offences because he was under duress from his brother, Bassam Hamzy. Apparently, due to his father's incarceration whilst he was only eight years of age, the applicant came to look upon Bassam Hamzy as a father figure for a period of about four years, between the applicant's eighth and twelfth birthdays. At about that time, Bassam Hamzy fled Australia to live overseas.

231Amoun described his brother Bassam as violent and prone to mood swings. He said that he was aware that his brother had the ability and resources to have people do things for him outside the jail, even though his brother was incarcerated. He was apparently aware that his brother had organised retribution against other individuals, who were not members of the family, who had not done what they had said they would do. 

232A specific example which Amoun proffered in evidence was that, having finished school, he had entered into an apprenticeship which returned only a low wage. He said that his brother, Bassam, had expressed his displeasure at the low wage being earned and forced him into resigning.

233In his Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing Judge noted that it was the Crown case that Amoun, whilst not the principal in the drug syndicate, occupied a position at the top of the hierarchy in the supply network, and was intimately involved in the offence. Counsel for the applicant submitted to the contrary that the role of the applicant was simply to facilitate the transfer of drugs as directed by his older brother. 

234His Honour accepted that the general task of ascertaining the role of people involved in the supply of drugs is not a simple exercise, but required careful consideration to be given to the particular facts, matters and circumstances. The sentencing Judge concluded the following:

""I am of the view that the conduct of the offender in relation to the particular supplies, the nature and content of intercepted calls and the context of the movement of the drug, and the particular transactions engaged in, permits a conclusion that the offender operated at an organisational level within a network operated by Bassam Hamzy. Of significance is the position the offender occupied close to the source of the drug and the direct contact with the supplier of bulk quantities of the drug to the network. ... 

It must be kept in mind that whilst the investigation revealed a number of separate drug supplies during the course of surveillance, the offender was involved in a limited number of them. At the same time, whilst he occupied a significant role, Bassam Hamzy had an overarching role in the majority of steps of each transaction. ... Whilst the offender's role was significant in relation to a number of transactions, his overall role in the network was substantially less than that of Bassam Hamzy and ultimately OS1, who over time gravitated towards a prominent position towards to the top of the syndicate.

The sentencing of the offender must proceed on the basis that he played a significant role in the individual supplies he was engaged in and that the combination of his conduct in each supply, including the matters on the Form 1, would support a conclusion that he occupied a significant role in the enterprise here"".

235His Honour went on to consider the question of duress. He said:

""The evidence establishes that Bassam Hamzy is a person capable of extreme violence and is capable of organising the extracting of retribution from his cell. The offender has just reason to fear Bassam Hamzy. This issue here is whether that fear was causally related to the conduct of the offender and, if so, to what extent.

It would be artificial to remove this factor as having some influence upon the decision of the offender to act in the way he did. However, there are significant matters which would suggest that such fear was subsidiary to other reasons for the offender's involvement. It is significant that the offender tampered with the drug on one occasion. The explanation offered by the offender is difficult to accept. I am of the view that this fact permits a conclusion that fear was not a substantial factor in the decision of the offender to become involved. Further, the offender admitted to the psychologist that money was a factor. I am of the view that the offender's fear of Bassam Hamzy does not significantly reduce his moral culpability.""

236Counsel for Amoun argued that the factual finding that Amoun had just reason to fear Bassam Hamzy was inconsistent with his Honour's finding that the applicant's moral culpability was not significantly reduced. 

237I am not satisfied that this is necessarily so on the facts and circumstances of this case. There was conduct, engaged in by Amoun, identified by the sentencing Judge which is quite inconsistent with his acting only out of fear of his brother, and by reason of that fear, acting under duress, for the purpose of s 21A(3)(d) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 

238What his Honour has found, in an entirely unexceptional way, is that the influence of duress was not a significant or particularly weighty factor. However, his Honour took it into account and allocated it, so it seems, some weight. I would not uphold this ground.

Ground 1 
239This ground complains about the insufficient discount by reason of Amoun's assistance. 

240Amoun pleaded guilty to the two counts on the indictment. He also asked that three further matters be taken into account on a Form 1. Amoun was sentenced by Zahra DCJ after OS1 was sentenced, but before the Court of Criminal Appeal heard the appeal by OS1. Both Amoun and OS1 had provided assistance to the authorities, and both were entitled to an appropriate discount to reflect that assistance.

241The applicant accepts that when considering this ground of appeal, the sentence imposed, prior to the discount being applied, was an appropriate one. 

242In his Remarks on Sentence, his Honour determined that an appropriate discount for Amoun's plea of guilty was 12.5 per cent. Amoun entered the plea of guilty on the first day of trial. The sentencing Judge acknowledged that although entered at that time, the plea was nevertheless of utilitarian benefit because the trial was likely to be a lengthy one, and that ultimately what had been saved was the cost of that trial, and the disruption to the lives of the witnesses. 

243The sentencing Judge then considered the question of assistance to authorities. 

244In the course of his Remarks on Sentence, his Honour noted that in 2009, whilst on remand, Amoun had provided assistance to the authorities, the detail of which he set out in some length. As well, the applicant agreed to make himself available to give evidence, if required, in the trial of Khaled Chkhaidem. Ultimately, he was not required. 

245The statement which Amoun gave was provided by the authorities to the solicitors for all of his co-accused. Following the provision of his statement, a number of his co-accused commenced to plead guilty. The Crown acknowledged before the sentencing Judge, and again before this Court, that Amoun's statement was an important factor in securing the guilty pleas for 16 other co-accused.

246OS1, upon appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, received a combined discount for his early plea of guilty and assistance to authorities of 60 per cent. A combined discount of 25 percent, representing 12.5 percent for assistance to authorities, which was given to Amoun here, is significantly less than that discount. 

247It is not a matter of merely comparing mathematical discounts to ascertain what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of the applicant's case. On the contrary, in assessing the discount for a sentence by reason of the provision of assistance to authorities, each case bears examination individually. Nevertheless, some guidance can be obtained by observing what, upon appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal has thought appropriate in the case of OS1. 

248Assistance to authorities carries a significant utilitarian benefit. The assistance which Amoun here provided related to more than one coaccused and, having regard to the identities and natures of other co-accused, placed Amoun at some personal risk to his safety. 

249The fact that Amoun did not give evidence at the trial of Chkhaidem, or other trials, should not be held against him where he was willing so to do, and the reason that he did not was because the accused pleaded guilty. 

250An additional discount of 12.5 percent for assistance to authorities in my assessment, significantly underestimated the value to be attributed to that assistance. 

251I would assess the appropriate combined discount for Amoun's plea of guilty, and for his assistance to authorities, to be 35 percent. 

252This error means that it will be necessary to re-sentence Amoun. In so doing, there is no reason to alter the overall (undiscounted) sentence imposed. However, in order to reflect appropriately the principle of totality and give full effect to the adjusted discount, it will be necessary to modestly alter the period of accumulation imposed by the sentencing Judge. Special circumstances apply. 

253I propose the following orders in this application and appeal:

(a)Application for leave to appeal granted.

(b)Appeal upheld.

(c)Sentence imposed on 23 March 2012 quashed.

(d)In lieu thereof Amoun is sentenced as follows:

(i)On Count 1, taking into account the three matters on a Form 1 a non-parole period of 4 years and 4 months commencing on 30 April 2012, with a balance of term of 2 years and 7 months. The total sentence will expire on 29 March 2019.

(ii)On Count 2, a non-parole period of 3 years and 5 months commencing on 30 January 2011, with a balance of term of 1 year and 9 months. The total sentence will expire on 29 March 2016.

(iii)The first day upon which Amoun will be eligible to be released is 29 August 2016. 

254CAMPBELL J: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgments of the other members of the Court. I agree with the orders proposed by Garling J for the disposition of each matter. I also agree with the reasons of Garling J in relation to each ground in each matter other than the Form 1 grounds raised in the Abbas, Bodiotis and Amoun matters.

255The Chief Justice, Basten JA and Hoeben CJ at CL (Garling J agreeing with the Chief Justice and Hoeben CJ at CL) have concluded that the learned sentencing judge did not err when he had regard to ""the additional criminality in the Form 1 offences"", as one of many relevant factors, in arriving at the appropriate sentence for ""the primary offence"". I agree with this conclusion. 

256I agree with the reasons of the Chief Justice and generally with those of Hoeben CJ at CL. At [34] of his reasons, Hoeben CJ at CL considers that the reference to extracting retribution for serious offences in the guideline judgment at [42] ""can only be a reference to the offences on the Form 1 being offences 'for which no punishment has in fact been imposed'"". With respect, I disagree with this conclusion. I agree with what the Chief Justice has written about this aspect of the matter at [22].

257In addition to the reasons given by the Chief Justice on this point, I wish to add some comments of my own. In the course of oral argument great emphasis was laid upon the meaning properly derived from [42] of Spigelman CJ's reasons in Attorney Generals Reference, especially the following sentence:

""The second [element] is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed""

It seems to me that the juxtaposition of the phrase ""serious offences"" with the construct ""other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed"" makes Spigelman CJ's meaning clear. His use of the plural ""serious offences"" is a reference to the principal offence. His Honour's deployment of the plural connotes merely that he was expressing himself in terms of some generality: it is an element of the sentencing process generally that the community is entitled to extract retribution for serious offences. This entitlement is enlarged by the existence of the further offences, with which the offender has been charged, and which he has admitted. But as Spigelman CJ made clear, as a matter of principle, retribution is extracted only for the principal offence: that is the offence for which the offender is sentenced: Attorney Generals Reference at [43].

258In my view, if at the request of an offender the Court is take further offences into account ""in dealing with the offender for the principal offence"" it is inevitable that regard must be had to the criminality involved in those further offences. By dint of s 33 Sentencing Procedure Act the admitted further offences on the Form 1 are matters which necessarily bear upon the judgment to be reached about the appropriate sentence for the principal offence. No sensible bearing can be taken from them unless some assessment is made of the criminality involved in the further offences. Clearly, in a case where the further offences are relatively minor, they may add little or nothing to the sentence for the principal offence. But where, as in the case of the applicant Abbas, for example, the criminality involved in the further offences is significant, the effect might be ""substantial"": Attorney Generals Reference at [18]. The range of possible effects of the further offences on the appropriate sentence, however, is not unlimited: Attorney Generals Reference at [42] and [67].

259Application of the principle of totality itself involves the consideration of whether ""the effective sentence imposed upon an offender represent[s] a proper period of incarceration for the total criminality involved"": R v AEM Senior [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [70]. I accept that expressions like ""total criminality"" must be used with care in this context: Attorney Generals Reference at [29].

260The Chief Justice and Hoeben CJ at CL have referred to providing the offender ""with a clean slate"" as one purpose of the Form 1 procedure. This benefit may come at a cost: an increase in the sentence that ""would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone"": Attorney Generals Reference at [18].

2761552,R v Goel [2013] NSWDC 153,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Dinker Goel appears for sentence on two charges of lodging tax returns with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to the Commonwealth. The first count relates to ten tax returns and the second relates to six tax returns.

2I am sentencing Mr Goel in somewhat unusual circumstances. In 2011, I sentenced him for forty-one similar offences, each relating on that occasion to a single tax return. The offences for which Mr Goel must now be sentenced today are in relevant respects identical to the offences for which I sentenced him back in September 2011. He committed these new offences at the same time as what I will call the old offences, he used the same method of committing the offences, and they were investigated at the same time. No explanation at all has been offered as to why these two offences covering sixteen tax returns were not dealt with at the same time as the earlier offences. The unexplained delay in dealing with these matters has led to a sentence significantly less than would otherwise have been the case.

3I set out the circumstances of Mr Goel's offending when I sentenced him on the earlier occasion. It is only therefore necessary for me to very briefly indicate what Mr Goel did. He was a tax agent who prepared tax returns for taxpayers without their knowledge. He used fictitious data to indicate on the tax returns the income earned by the taxpayer and the deductions they claimed. In effect, the scheme was to obtain refunds, not for the taxpayer of course but for Mr Goel and others working with him. In some cases the Australian Tax Office did not pay the refunds but in other cases they did. For count 1 a refund of $30,000 was paid. About $17,000 was stopped. For count 2 only a refund of fifty-eight dollars was paid with $20,000 being stopped. Had the scheme succeeded, these two counts would have led to a loss to the Commonwealth of something in the order of $70,000.

4Mr Goel pleaded guilty to these offences at an earlier stage than his previous offences, indicating thus a greater willingness to facilitate the course of justice. He has also acknowledged his conduct, at least to prison medical authorities. He told them in relation to his earlier offending that he was accepting responsibility for his offences and the sentence imposed upon him. 

5Of course, when I sentenced Mr Goel earlier I also referred to his subjective circumstances. Not a lot has changed apart from the fact that he has obviously been in custody and as a result of that his family has suffered, not to any exceptional level but suffer they have. Unfortunately, this is of course commonplace when breadwinners are sent to gaol for serious offending.

6I am being fairly brief in these remarks because of the large commonality between the objective and subjective features when I sentenced Mr Goel in September 2011 when compared with the sentence that I must impose today. It is of course a matter of great regret, not only to the Court but to Mr Goel specifically, that these new matters were not dealt with at the same time as the old matters. When Mr Goel was sentenced in September 2011 he was entitled to look to the earliest date of release, 8 September 2013 as being the date on which, assuming he was released to parole, he would be allowed to leave gaol. It is no doubt disappointing to him that he now faces the likelihood that that release date will be later on. That is of course one of the circumstances that leads to a lower sentence in this case than I would otherwise have imposed. 

7Of course, these offences are serious. As I explained in the original remarks on sentence, the Australian Taxation Office simply cannot investigate the accuracy of tax returns filed by every purported taxpayer. It relies on the honesty of those filling in forms and claiming refunds. For that reason, a significant component of general deterrence is required when offences such as this are discovered. 

8Mr Goel was, at the time I sentenced him earlier, a man of prior good character. As Mr Norrie points out, had these matters been dealt with at the same time, he would have been of prior good character when he was dealt with for all matters. I can clearly take that into account, but I do have to say that given the circumstance that there are a number, fifty-seven in fact, of separate false tax returns having been prepared by Mr Goel over a period of time, to state the obvious, this is not a case where Mr Goel did one thing and then immediately regretted it. 

9Consistent with Mr Goel's attitude to work and character, he is doing well in custody. He is proud of the position of responsibility that he now holds whilst in gaol. 

10Largely because of the unexplained delay I will impose concurrent sentences on these two counts. I impose a sentence of imprisonment of eighteen months to commence on 9 September 2015. Under s 19AD of the Crimes Act, I set a single non-parole period to cover all sentences imposed by me both past and present. That non-parole period is to be one of two years and six months to commence on 9 September 2011 and expire on 8 March 2014. It is my intention that Mr Goel spend six months longer in custody. 

11HIS HONOUR: Mr Goel, you've probably just heard me to say to counsel that you are now to spend six months longer in custody because of these new offences. Your first date that you can be released to parole is 8 March 2014. Once you are released to parole, you will continue to serve your sentence until the entire sentence expires on 8 June 2017. Any other order required?

		26 August 2013",2013-05-23 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2761566,R v Terrence David KAIN [2013] NSWSC 638,"Judgment

Introduction

1Terrence David Kain stood trial on an indictment charging him with the murder of Beverley Doris Kain on 27 February 2011. He pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. In the result, the jury acquitted him of murder and convicted him of manslaughter. Manslaughter carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 25 years. It is not submitted, nor could it be, that this is a case that should attract the maximum sentence or anything near it.

2There were two possible paths to the verdict: the first was that it was reasonably possible that he did not intend to kill Mrs Kain (who was his mother) or cause her grievous bodily harm; the second was that he did have one or other of these intentions but, by reason of his abnormal state of mind, his self-control and judgment were so affected as to warrant him being convicted of manslaughter rather than murder. It is relevant to the question of culpability that I determine whether or not Mr Kain intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to his mother. If he did, that would make his crime the more serious. It follows that it is for the Crown to satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that this was the case. Of course, Mr Kain's mental condition is relevant to this issue as well as the extent of his culpability.

The killing is reported 

3Mr Kain and his mother lived together in a house in suburban Goulburn. Just before 11pm on 27 February 2011, Mr Kain telephoned his sister Mrs Stinson and said, ""Mum's dead. I strangled her, she's dead"", and then hung up. She then rang her mother's home telephone. Mr Kain answered. His sister asked, ""What the hell have you done?"" He repeated, ""She's dead, I strangled her, she's dead"" and hung up. Mrs Stinson then called 000 and reported what Mr Kain had told her.

4Mrs Stinson said that she was well aware of her brother's voice, both when he was drunk and when he was sober. She did not think that he was affected by alcohol.

The police investigation

5At 11.02pm Senior Constable Goldstien and Constable Moller, who were then conducting routine patrols in the town, were directed to Mrs Kain's address. They got there two minutes later. As they walked up the driveway, the garage door opened and they saw Mr Kain standing in the entrance. He said, ""I killed her I strangled her"". He was placed on the ground, handcuffed and cautioned. The officer then asked, ""What happened?"" Mr Kain replied, ""I just lost it. I strangled her"". The officer asked, ""Where is she?"" and Mr Kain responded, ""In the bedroom. I lost it."" Constable Moller went into the house and returned a few minutes later to report that Mrs Kain was dead. She asked Mr Kain, ""When did you do this?"" He replied, ""About half an hour ago."" She said, ""She's still really warm, it couldn't have been that long ago"".

6Mrs Kain's body was found in the main bedroom in her night clothes. She was lying on the floor next to the bed with her head resting on a pillow which had obviously been placed there after she had fallen since it was inside the underneath cavity, as it were, of the bedside table. The only disturbance to the furniture was that a bedside lamp had been knocked over. The rest of the house appeared completely undisturbed. 

7Mr Kain remained at the house, whilst police inspected the premises. He asked for some water and was told that he would be taken down to the police station for an interview in due course and would be given water there. He also asked for psychiatric help, which was promised. He sat quietly, handcuffed, in the driveway of the house. After about half an hour he said, ""I'm not a bad guy, I just lost control."" About ten minutes later he started to cry. The officer asked him, ""Are you all right?"" and Mr Kain said, ""I'm just realising what I fucking done"". Some time after this the officer asked him, ""When you say you killed her, strangled her, what did you mean by that?"" The accused replied, ""I just freaked out"". He remembered calling his sister and gave some details about her. There was some further conversation to which it is not necessary to refer and he was then taken to the police station. 

8Mr Kain's interview at the police station commenced at about 2.15am. His account, in summary, was that he had argued with his mother before she went to her bedroom, he went out and had a smoke and then returned, the argument starting up again. He said that he could not remember what she said but she got loud and abusive. He said that he was upset and pushed at the bedroom door, that she fell backwards on the bed and went ""crook 'cause I'd pushed her over"". He said that he told her to shut up and stop saying those things and, after that, he did not know what happened. His account of what then happened is unclear but it seems that he went out of the room and then returned. His mother was on the floor beside the bed. He checked her pulse and (as I understand him), finding that she had none, panicked and rang his sister. He could not recall putting the pillow under his mother's head, although there can be no doubt that he did so. He said that he thought that when he pushed her over she went off the side of the bed and then onto the floor but he did not recall if she was alive or not. He was reminded that he had previously told police that he had strangled her but said that he did not recall doing this but had checked her pulse and assumed ""I done it"". He said he used the word ""strangled"", ""because that's what I felt like doing to her"" although he did not actually recall doing this. He repeated that, when he went back to the room, she was lying on the side of the bed on the floor and he thought that she had just fallen out of the bed and so he checked her pulse by putting his finger on the side of her neck but she wasn't breathing. He did not try to carry out CPR because he did not know how to do it. 

Autopsy

9At autopsy, the pathologist, Dr Wills, concluded that the cause of Mrs Kain's death was compression of the neck caused by manual strangulation. He noted multiple areas of bruising to the muscles of the neck, a fracture in the hyoid bone and fractures of the thyroid cartilage, located at the front of the neck just below the chin. There was also bruising around the right side of the face and the right collar bone. He also found deep bruising to the back of the head, of both shoulder areas of her back and mid-upper back, on the back of her left arm and on the front of her upper right arm in the bicep area. He said that the bruising to the upper back and upper arms might be caused by contact with, or more likely pressure from, the ground and possible gripping or handling at the time of the offence. He thought that, if the deceased fell to the ground as a result of being pushed, this could have caused the deep bruising to which he referred, whilst the bruising to the upper arms could be the result of gripping or handling during resuscitation, although this latter explanation was less likely because of its extent. However, this possibility could not be entirely excluded. A blood sample was taken which showed a very low reading, so Mrs Kain was not affected by alcohol at all at the time. Because of the varying factors contributing to death due to compression of the neck, it was not possible to specify the time it took for Mrs Kain to die as a result.

Mr Kain's state of mind 

10In dealing with intention, it is necessary to consider, of course, Mr Kain's state of mind of which perhaps the most significant factor was his psychiatric condition. The application of sufficient force to strangle someone to death in most cases is strong evidence of an intention, at least, to cause grievous bodily harm. If Mr Kain's psychiatric condition was such as to make this understanding less likely, then it might be appropriate to conclude that he did not intend either to cause grievous bodily harm or death, taking into account of course the overall circumstances. 

11Each case must depend upon its own facts but, in the present case, were I to find that Mr Kain did not intend to cause death or grievous bodily harm and was guilty of manslaughter for the reason that Mrs Kain's death resulted from an unlawful and dangerous act, that would (as I have already mentioned) be objectively less serious than if he did have one or other of those intentions, even though his capacity to understand what was happening, judge the rightness or wrongness of his actions or control himself were substantially impaired by his abnormality of mind. It is also relevant to consider, were the appropriate conclusion that Mr Kain did not intend to cause death or grievous bodily harm to his mother, whether he realised himself that he was exposing his mother to an appreciable risk of serious injury or might not have realised this though a reasonable person in his position would have done so.

Background history

12Mr Kain was able to work and did so taking seasonal employment with fruit picking, working at a plant nursery and occasionally cutting and bagging firewood for sale. At times he has self-harmed, almost certainly as a result of depression becoming acute at times of intoxication. His self-harm involved cutting himself with knives on his arms and legs and burning himself with cigarette butts. The worst such incident in terms of its permanent effect upon him was that in May 1991 he shot himself in the leg and subsequently developed gangrene in his toe and foot which required a below knee amputation of his leg. His mobility depends on a prosthetic leg. 

13Mr Kain lived independently for a time in the early 1990's but then with his mother. He attempted rehabilitation on several occasions but without success. He was a binge drinker so that he would seem sober for periods and then, when he received his social security cheque, spend it largely on drink. It was a disability pension. He did manage to work around the house, mowing the lawns, putting in a vegetable garden and some landscaping of the backyard. Although relatives saw what might be regarded as spats between him and his mother, they would be over in a short time and the relationship returned to normal. They did not ever see him becoming aggressive or offering any violence, nor did Mrs Kain ever say anything to Mr Kain's siblings about Mr Kain being violent towards her. They never saw him get involved in any fights or even verbal abuse. A neighbour noticed that in the last few weeks before Mrs Kain's death, Mr Kain and his mother seemed to have more arguments which involved a lot of yelling. She could not make out what was being said. I gather that Mrs Kain's voice was the louder. The neighbour described these exchanges as ""snippets"".

Psychiatric evidence

14The Crown called Professor Greenberg whilst the defence relied on the evidence of Dr Furst. Both of these witnesses were highly qualified and very experienced forensic psychiatrists. Indeed, their opinions, to my mind, were to much the same effect in respect of Mr Kain's mental impairment, differing only - and then not by much - as to the possible contribution of intoxication to his actions. Both doctors relied also on the opinion of Dr Ilana Hepner, a clinical neuropsychologist who conducted a psychometric assessment of Mr Kain's cognition, behaviour and mood. 

15Since both doctors accepted Dr Hepner's results and gave opinions in part which relied on them, I deal with her evidence first. She saw Mr Kain on 30 January 2012 in prison, interviewing him, obtaining a history, asking him about his cognitive function and administering tests. These tests include measures of different domains of cognitive function or thinking skills, including an evaluation of intellectual function, attention processing speed, spatial ability, high-level executive function and also mood. She also observed his behaviour throughout the assessment. Mr Kain had a history of heavy drinking with no period of abstinence, which would have adversely affected cognitive function such memory and executive function. The testing was conducted almost a year after the events in question, when he would have been abstinent from alcohol and receiving good nutrition for a significant period. Accordingly, it was likely that his cognitive functions would have improved. These impairments are evident even after abstinence for up to three months but, as time goes on, most people show some improvement in these areas. As Dr Hepner put it, 98% of Mr Kain's peers, matched for age and other background characteristics would perform better than him or, measuring his impairment in another way, 92% to 97% of his aged matched peers would perform better than him.

16An MRI brain study conducted on 19 March 2012 demonstrated diffuse brain damage which was chronic in nature. It was long standing. This damage was almost certainly caused by Mr Kain having been an alcoholic for many years. The history from his family members was that he had been binge drinking from his mid-teens onward, becoming especially severe when he reached 18 or 19.

17There is no doubt that Mr Kain suffers from an alcohol induced persisting dementia with memory impairment and what was described as ""mild"" executive function impairment. I have put the qualifier ""mild"" in quotations because in this context it means rather more than it might connote to the layman. Although, as dementia goes, Mr Kain's condition is mild (as distinct from moderate or severe) it is nevertheless significant. The executive function impairment demonstrated in his psychometric testing reflected damage to the frontal part of the brain. This area of function involves the ability to reason and control his behaviour as well as make judgments, to plan and sequence thoughts. Not surprisingly, these limitations become more marked when a person is angry or in an emotionally loaded situation. In addition, as I have already mentioned, the testing would be likely to demonstrate better executive functioning because of his abstinence and the calm situation in which it occurred as distinct from whilst he was still insulting his brain with alcohol and in an emotionally charged state, as at the time of the incident. 

18As to Mr Kain's claimed difficulty with recalling what happened in any detail, his dementia would, at all events, impair his memory. Although he may in fact remember and falsely claim not to do so, Professor Greenberg did not think this was the case, although it could not be dispelled as a possibility. He thought the most likely explanation was a combination of psychogenic brain damage, which occurs when people are so shocked by what they have done they block it out and do not have a true memory to draw on - this is not deliberate but unconscious - or dementia and the effects of alcohol. Mr Kain told Dr Furst that he did recall arguing with his mother about some roses in the garden and her ""having a go at me about my drinking and smoking cigarettes"". He said that he thought that he pushed his mother but did not have an actual recollection of doing so. Dr Furst agreed with Professor Greenberg that his lack of memory was most likely psychogenic amnesia. 

19I should mention at this point that I do not accept that Mr Kain was significantly affected by alcohol at the time of his violent attack upon his mother. That is not to say that he did not have alcohol in his system but I think he was by no means intoxicated. There was evidence that he had been drinking some hours before this incident but not in any especially large amount. To the evidence of Mrs Stinson that she did not detect the changes in Mr Kain's voice that occurred when he had been drinking, should be added the significant evidence of the police officers who saw him very shortly after the event and did not think that he was affected by alcohol in any way. Furthermore he was interviewed shortly after 2am on 28 February 2011 and did not give any sign of intoxication. 

20Each psychiatrist, of course, relied in part on their appreciation of the history given by Mr Kain and their understanding of what came from other witnesses. It is not necessary for present purposes to analyse this material in detail. It is enough to say that my own view of that history and that evidence is closer to that described by Dr Furst than by Professor Greenberg and, accordingly, I accept his view that the main factors in Mr Kain's conduct at the material time were the effect of his dementia on his thinking and loss of control together with associated depression, personality vulnerabilities and his acute emotional state.

21The extent to which Mr Kain was in such an emotional state is very difficult to assess because of course, there were no witnesses present at the time and Mr Kain's own account of what happened is exiguous. At the same time, I think it is important to note that he had lived with his mother for many years whilst suffering from alcoholism and, although, at times he harmed himself quite significantly during episodes of anger and depression requiring hospitalisation, these were directed towards himself and never, so as far can be ascertained, at any other person, let alone his mother.

Conclusion as to intention 

22I am convinced that Mr Kain lost his temper as a result of angry exchanges between himself and his mother, which in all likelihood involved allegations that he was responsible for his father's dying of oesophageal cancer caused by passive smoking (Mr Kain being a heavy smoker), these allegations having often been made before. I have no doubt that the explanation for his violence towards his mother was that he lost control during an angry and possibly quite extended exchange and that this loss of control was substantially contributed to by his dementia. In short, if Mr Kain had not suffered from this condition I think it very improbable indeed that he would have acted as he did. Certainly, he was aware that he had strangled his mother and had used some considerable force in doing so. 

23Although it is quite possible that Mr Kain does not have now any real recollection of the actual violence and perhaps did not have a clear recollection even shortly after the event, it cannot be doubted that he was intentionally violent towards her, knew that he was using significant force and that he was strangling her. Weighing up the evidence as best I can, however, I am left with a reasonable doubt that he actually intended to kill his mother or cause her grievous bodily harm. He intentionally inflicted violence, significant violence, but I think that his state of mind at the time was likely to have prevented him from truly appreciating the likely outcome of his actions except, of course, that his mother could be seriously hurt. In this respect the cognitive impairment caused by his brain damage which caused a delay in processing information strikes me as of particular importance. 

24In coming to this conclusion, I am very much influenced by the undoubted fact that any violence, let alone of such a serious kind, appears to have been quite out of character for Mr Kain. Of course, I cannot positively say that he did not intend to kill his mother or cause grievous bodily harm but, considering all the evidence, I am left with a reasonable doubt that he did have one or other of these intentions. It follows that I must sentence Mr Kain upon the basis that he was guilty of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. In this regard, his mental condition is obviously of considerable importance in measuring his moral and criminal responsibility.

Subjective features

25Mr Kain has no prior convictions. Neither, as it appears, has he come to the attention of police in relation to any criminal activity. Since an early age he has been an alcoholic. The only significant relationships in his life have been with his family and, in particular, with his mother. No doubt he has lived his life as best he could, though not happily. He certainly, I think, has wished to kill himself in the past but has not been able to bring himself to the point of doing so. He has now been abstinent for something over two years but he is, of course, still an alcoholic and still suffers from a significant degree of depression. Shortly after the event, he expressed remorse and this has been consistently reported in the psychiatric reports. I have no doubt that his remorse is genuine and profound.

Victim Impact Statements

26I have carefully read the victim impact statements which have been made by Mrs Kain's daughter Deborah, son Brian, daughter Donna, sisters Frances, Barbara and Judith, grandson Luke, granddaughter Kobi, daughter-in-law Gabrielle and son-in-law Ronald. These statements pay loving and eloquent tribute to Mrs Kain as a loving, generous, kind and good humoured woman who was at the very centre of the life of their family and whose loss has been a terrible blow from which they are still suffering enormous grief. This is all the worse since she was killed at the hand of her own son, for whom she had been a loving, generous and caring mother. Nothing that the law permits me to do by way of punishment of Mr Kain can possible assuage their grief, nor can any words of mine afford any comfort. The most I can do is to offer the condolences of the Court for their loss. 

Conclusions

27Mr Kain's psychiatric condition is such that he is not an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence and that no particular weight other than that which is ordinarily applicable in these cases needs to be given to specific deterrence. I am of the view that this act of violence was entirely out of character although what the particular factors were which came together to cause him to lose control in this way cannot be identified beyond speculation. I do not believe that he represents a danger to the public and I think that it is most unlikely that he will offend in this way again. Overall, I am sure that his remorse and contrition and experience with the justice system and his period of imprisonment will operate as a powerful deterrent and reinforce what appears to be his own strong inclination to non-violence.

28Although, as I have mentioned, I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Kain intended to kill his mother or cause her grievous bodily harm, I am satisfied that he was well aware that he was seriously hurting his mother, although his dementia caused him to lose control in the extent of violence that he inflicted. This was a serious crime, especially since it resulted in death, which requires the imposition of a custodial sentence. 

29Mr Kain has been in custody since 27 February 2011. This lengthy period of remand is significant, not only because it, of course, must be taken into account, but also because whilst on remand a prisoner does not have available the services or the activities which are available to a sentenced prisoner and, to that extent, is significantly more harsh. Furthermore, because of his mental condition his imprisonment must itself be subject to difficulties which the ordinary prisoner does not face. I understand that he has been in protection and is likely to serve his sentence on protection. Although there is no evidence as to precisely what difference this entails, there is no doubt that some restrictions are placed on him which are not imposed on ordinary prisoners. I have given this factor some, but not much, weight in light of the lack of evidence of the actual terms of his imprisonment.

Early Plea

30Mr Kain offered to plead guilty to manslaughter on 4 April 2011 prior to his being committed for trial and entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter at the commencement of the trial. It is rightly conceded by the Crown that he should have the benefit of the discount allowed pursuant to s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. There is no reason why the full discount of 25% should not be allowed. 

Special Circumstances 

31A substantial period of supervision is desirable in the public interest when Mr Kain is released on parole, as I have no doubt he will be at the expiration of his non-parole period. This is required both because of his alcoholism and dementia. Accordingly, I have varied the statutory ratio provided by s 40 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to increase the period that he otherwise would have served on parole.

Sentence 

32Taking a starting point of 9 years imprisonment and applying the discount yields an overall term of 6 years and 9 months. Adjusting the statutory period by reason of the special circumstances, I impose a non-parole period of 4 years. This sentence will commence on 27 February 2011.

		30 May 2013",2013-05-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2761597,Carpenter v R [2013] NSWCCA 130,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with Fullerton J.
2FULLERTON J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal from sentences imposed in the District Court on 15 July 2011 having entered pleas of guilty on the day listed for his trial to two counts accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment.
3Both offences were committed on 20 March 2010 and involved the applicant attempting to set fire to property in a unit in Leichhardt and then setting fire to that unit knowing that Jeremy Nixon was in the premises.
4The first offence was committed in breach of s 196(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 when the applicant attempted to set fire to some property belonging to Mr Nixon, intending to cause him bodily injury.  That offence attracted a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.  The second offence charged the applicant with recklessly causing Mr Nixon grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act when the applicant set fire to the unit whilst Mr Nixon was asleep inside.  The second offence attracted a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 4 years.  Mr Nixon suffered mixed thickness burns to approximately 25 per cent of his body including both feet, both arms and his back.  A skin graft was required to treat the burns to his back.  
5For the first offence the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 20 March 2010 (to account for pre-sentence custody) with an additional term of 2 years and 3 months.  For the second offence he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months to date from 20 March 2012 with an additional term of 3 years.  
6Following a finding of special circumstances an effective head sentence of 7 years and 3 months with an effective non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months was imposed.  
The appeal
7The applicant relies upon two grounds of appeal:Ground 1:  The sentencing judge erred in his determination that the criminal record of the accused was an aggravating factor (for either offence); and
Ground 2:  The sentencing judge erred in his determination that the sentence imposed for count 4 (the second offence) commence two years after the commencement of the non-parole period for the second count (the first offence).
The evidence on sentence
8A statement of agreed facts was tendered on sentence together with a number of photographs which showed very extensive fire damage throughout the unit and fire damage to the external facing of the unit.  The Crown also tendered police facts sheets that related to two previous offences involving the malicious destruction or damage to property contrary to s 195(A) of the Crimes Act recorded as part of the applicant's criminal antecedents.  A statement from Mr Nixon was also tendered in which he detailed the extent of the physical and psychological injury he suffered as a consequence of the applicant's offending and its impact on his daily functioning and social life. 
9The applicant tendered a report form Dr Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, and a number of testimonials.  He did not give evidence on sentence. 
The facts for sentencing purposes
10The applicant had resided in the unit at Leichhardt for a time in 2009 in an intimate relationship with the owner.  Some time prior to December 2009, when she terminated the relationship, the applicant moved out.  The applicant took up residence at a unit in Petersham.  It would appear that there was some continuing contact between them but the relationship was not a close one.
11Some time in March 2010 the owner of the Leichhardt unit arranged for Jeremy Nixon, a friend of long standing, to stay at her unit as she was due to enter hospital for a short period.  He travelled from his home in Byron Bay on 19 March 2010.  When the applicant was told of the arrangements he reacted jealously and an argument erupted.  
12It would appear that the applicant was at the unit early on the morning of 20 March 2010 but left taking with him two bottles of port which he had earlier purchased for the owner.  When she woke later that morning she set off to the applicant's unit to retrieve the missing alcohol.  She visited a nearby hotel on her return where she remained drinking throughout the afternoon.   
13Mr Nixon was sleeping in the spare room in the unit during the afternoon when he was woken by the applicant who threatened to kill him if he did not pack his belongings and leave.  Mr Nixon did not know the applicant and told him that he was at the unit with the owner's permission.  His attempts to calm the applicant and lure him from the premises were unsuccessful.  Mr Nixon went back to the spare room and closed the door behind him.  The applicant followed him and tried to force his way in through the closed door.  Mr Nixon barricaded the door and went to lie down expecting that the applicant would eventually leave.  He fell back to sleep.
14He was woken some unspecified time later by the applicant pushing open the bedroom door holding a burning envelope in one hand and a cigarette lighter in the other.  He then knelt down and tried to set alight a towel which was lying over some boxes which contained Mr Nixon's belongings.  Mr Nixon succeeded in first knocking the applicant over and then knocking the burning envelope and the cigarette lighter from his hand before forcing him out of the bedroom.  He also succeeded in extinguishing the fire.  He then closed and barricaded the door a second time.  The door to the bedroom locked automatically upon closing.  The applicant continued to yell abuse.  Mr Nixon went back to sleep.
15He was awoken a second time, on this occasion by loud pounding on the front door by the next door neighbour.  He opened the bedroom door to discover that the unit was on fire.  He determined that he had the option of either leaping from the bedroom window or attempting to go through the fire to the fire escape by the front door.  He chose the latter, in the course of which he sustained the very significant burns to his body.
16The fire brigade was called and the fire was extinguished. 
17The extent of Mr Nixon's injuries, including the pain associated with medical treatment he received and the complications that retarded his recovery, was one of the features of the offending the subject of the second offence that his Honour was satisfied placed it within the mid range of offending for the purpose of giving consideration to the standard non-parole period applied to that offence.  Mr Nixon was not discharged from hospital until 7 May 2010.
18The applicant was arrested by police at his unit in Petersham later on the afternoon of 20 March 2010.  He was in the courtyard drinking alcohol.  He later participated in an ERISP (which was not tendered on sentence).  He admitted to being at the unit at Leichhardt earlier that afternoon but claimed that he remained at the front door where he argued with the owner about Mr Nixon.  He said that as he was leaving he was assaulted by Mr Nixon.  He denied lighting the fire. 
Subjective features
19The applicant was 51 at the time of the offences.  He told Dr Nielssen that he had no memory of the offences.  He said that on 20 March 2010 he had consumed a cocktail of drugs and alcohol, comprised of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication, Valium, eight tablets of diazepam, 750ml of Sambucca and a quantity of sherry.  He said he had been under treatment for depression since 1995, when he stopped working.  
20He had a lengthy criminal record commencing in 1976.  He has received the benefit of two separate good behaviour bonds, one in 1995 as a result of a conviction for demanding money with menaces, and a further bond in 2003 for the malicious destruction of property, both of which were breached.  The first breach resulted in a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months and the second breach a suspended sentence.  That offence, together with another earlier offence of a similar kind (supported by the tender of the facts sheets earlier referred to), involved the applicant damaging property under the control of the Department of Housing.  The offence in February 2003 concerned conflict with a neighbour who the applicant threatened and ordered to leave the housing units before damaging his property.  The offence in September 2003 concerned his objection to the Department of Housing's proposal that he leave the premises and move to other premises and the damage he caused in defiance of that proposal. 
21The applicant's intelligence was assessed in the normal range.  
22Supported by the available medical records, Dr Nielssen diagnosed a substance abuse disorder based upon the applicant's account of longstanding cannabis use, binge drinking and frequent episodes of amnesia whilst under the effects of alcohol.  Despite accepting that the applicant's state of intoxication contributed to the offending in the sense that he was unlikely to have committed the offences if sober, his Honour was not satisfied that the applicant's substance abuse disorder mitigated the objective seriousness of his offending.  This was not subject to any challenge on the appeal.
23Special circumstances were found on the basis of the applicant's age, the fact that in the ten years prior to the subject offending he had not come to the attention of police, his substance abuse and mental health issues, and the partial accumulation of the sentences.
Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in his determination that the criminal record of the accused was an aggravating factor (for either offence)
24In his reasons for sentence his Honour said as follows: I have considered s 21A both in terms of mitigating and aggravating factors.  The two relevant aggravating factors are that there was a risk of death and that he has a criminal history which is relevant in a Veen sense, that is it is relevant to my assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation and of the need for personal/specific deterrence.
25Although there was no evidence as to the extent of risk of injury to other residents in the unit block in Leichhardt, and no evidence as to the seat of the fire or the means by which it was set and ignited, the extent of damage to the unit temporarily occupied by Mr Nixon as depicted in the photographs was obviously such as to support the inference that the fire was set inside the unit and of sufficient force that it came to the attention of neighbouring residents who raised the alarm.  In these circumstances there was a legitimate basis for his Honour finding that the offence was aggravated by presenting a risk of death to others (as provided for in s 21A(2)(ib) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999).  In any event, there is no challenge to that finding on the appeal.
26In contrast, the applicant complains that his Honour took into account the applicant's criminal history in circumstances where there was no legitimate basis in the evidence for a finding that it operated to aggravate the offending in any relevant sense, and that neither party submitted that he should do so.  Although not determinative of this ground of appeal, the Crown emphasised that the applicant's submission that neither party referred to the applicant's prior record is contradicted by the written submissions of counsel who appeared on sentence who made express reference to the offender's criminal history (s 21A(2)(d)), as a statutory feature of aggravation, together with the fact that the offence was committed in a person's home (s 21A(2)(eb)) and that there was a grave risk of death (s 21A(2)(ib)).   
27His Honour referred to the applicant's criminal history as relevant in two respects, the first his prospects of rehabilitation, and the second the need for specific deterrence.  Irrespective of whether it was strictly accurate for his Honour to refer to Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465; 33 A Crim R 230 as authority for the proposition that the applicant's criminal record informed the issue of rehabilitation, the applicant does not and could not submit that reference to an offender's criminal history cannot, in an appropriate case, and in accordance with sentencing principles, inform an offender's prospects of rehabilitation and the need for specific deterrence.  Importantly, it is not submitted that his Honour has taken the applicant's criminal history into account so as to increase the sentence beyond that which is proportionate to the objective seriousness of the offending (see R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 per Spigelman CJ at [24]).
28Veen (No 2) remains authority for the proposition that it is legitimate to take into account an offender's prior criminal record when it illuminates the offender's moral culpability or to act as a deterrent to the offender from committing further offences of a like kind (see the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan Dawson and Toohey JJ at [447]).  This approach has frequently been endorsed by this Court.
29In R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300, an appeal against a sentence for aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death, Howie J (Spigelman CJ and Wood CJ at CL agreeing) said (at [29]):There were two factors which his Honour took into account as aggravating features in relation to s 21A(2).  The first was the applicant's criminal record.  Much of that record was, in my view, irrelevant.  However, there was one matter which was relevant to a consideration of the sentence to be imposed upon the applicant and that was the fact that in 2001 the applicant had been convicted of an offence which appears to have arisen from his use of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.  That was a matter which his Honour would have been entitled to take into account as indicating, in accordance with the principle in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477 that personal deterrence was a matter which was to be given more significance than might otherwise have been the case. (emphasis added) 
30In my view, given the nature of the offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced, and previous offences involving the damage to property of others when he is in conflict with them or acting in revenge at a perceived injustice, it was open to his Honour to regard the need for specific deterrence to feature as part of the synthesis of factors bearing upon the fixing of an appropriate and proportionate sentence.
31In the result, I am not satisfied that his Honour's reference to the significance of the applicant's prior record was productive of error in any material respect, or that it was productive of a more severe penalty than was warranted, having regard to the offending for which the applicant was sentenced and his subjective circumstances.
32I would reject first ground of appeal.
Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in his determination that the sentence imposed for count 4 (the second offence) commence two years after the commencement of the non-parole period for the second count (the first offence)
33In essence, the applicant submitted that he was entitled to a greater degree of concurrency between the two sentences imposed by his Honour by reason of the fact that the offences arose out of the one incident with what was submitted to be a considerable overlap in the elements of both offences.  
34Despite the fact that the offences were committed on the same day and to that extent might be viewed as part of a single episode of criminality, the constituent elements of the offences were sufficiently different (with the second offence involving the infliction of injury while the first offence was limited to an intention to cause bodily injury) and the circumstances in which they were committed of a markedly different degree of seriousness, to justify a substantial increment in the effective sentence.  The structure of the sentencing order, with an accumulation of two years between the first and second offences, was well within the exercise of sentencing discretion.  In my view, any greater degree of concurrency would have failed to reflect the totality of the applicant's criminality.   
35Again, although not determinative, I note that when his Honour openly discussed with both counsel the sentence on the individual counts and the degree of accumulation he proposed, the applicant's counsel conceded that the effective sentence was within an appropriate range.
36The second ground of appeal is not made out.  
37The orders I propose are as follows:1.  Leave to appeal granted.2.  Appeal dismissed.
38McCALLUM J:  I agree with Fullerton J.

2761609,Eyles v R [2013] NSWCCA 128,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with McCallum J.

2ROTHMAN J: I agree with McCallum J.

3McCALLUM J: Jeffrey Paul Eyles seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court after he pleaded guilty to an offence of cultivating prohibited plants (cannabis) by enhanced indoor means for a commercial purpose contrary to s 23(1A) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for that offence is a fine of 3500 penalty units or imprisonment for 15 years, or both: s 33(2)(b) of the Act. The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of eighteen months and a balance of term of eighteen months, giving a total sentence of 3 years imprisonment. 

4The applicant also pleaded guilty to two firearms offences. There is no ground of appeal in respect of the sentences passed for those offences. Both arose from the applicant's possession of a plastic handgun. The laying of two charges reflects the fact that the applicant was not licensed and the handgun was not registered. The first was a charge of unauthorised possession of a prohibited pistol contrary to s 7(1) of the Act, which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 3 years. The second was a charge of possessing an unregistered firearm contrary to s 36(1) of the Firearms Act 1996. The maximum penalty for that offence, if the firearm is prohibited (as it was in the present case), is imprisonment for 10 years.

5At the time sentence was passed, the applicant was also dealt with for a series of offences on a ""form 1"" in accordance with s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. All of those offences arose out of the circumstances underlying the main drug charge.

6The applicant pleaded guilty to all offences at the earliest opportunity. The learned sentencing judge allowed a discount of 25% to reflect the utilitarian value of those pleas. 

7The charges arose from the execution of a search warrant at the applicant's home. The applicant was not present when police arrived to execute the warrant. The search revealed the existence of a large sophisticated hydroponic cannabis plantation in the garage of the home. The windows of the garage were covered with black plastic tape. Substantial changes had been made to the premises including the installation of large electronic fans to allow fresh air to be drawn into the garage. 

8Within the garage were six purpose-built individual growing rooms, each consisting of a high wattage globe suspended above a growing tray. Some of the lights were operated with timers, while others were operated manually. The plants were serviced with watering trays and electric water pumps, which fed high nutrient water to the plants.

9The six growing rooms were found to contain 58 cannabis plants described in the agreed statement of facts as being of very high quality and healthy, having an average height of over a metre.

10The search revealed that the applicant had bypassed the electricity meter so as to service the cultivation at no cost.

11In addition to the 58 growing plants, police located a plastic tub containing an amount of drying cannabis next to a fan; a small packet of cannabis seeds in a kitchen cupboard; a plastic tub containing eight individually packaged quantities of dried cannabis leaf and head in a bedroom and two further plastic shopping bags of dried cannabis head in a bedroom cupboard. Police also found an outdoor cannabis plot, which appeared to have been harvested recently. The outdoor plot contained a single remaining living cannabis plant. The cannabis drying in the garage, the packets of cannabis in the bedroom, the cannabis seed and the single outdoor plant formed the basis of four of the charges taken into account on the form 1 (two of possessing a prohibited drug; one of supplying a prohibited drug and one of cultivating a prohibited drug). Also on the form 1 were two charges of consuming electricity without authority and altering an electricity meter without authority. 

12The plastic handgun was found in a bedroom. It was described in the statement of facts as a BB type gun with an operating slide, trigger assembly and magazine clip. No rounds of ammunition were located within the gun.

13The applicant returned home during the execution of the warrant. He was arrested and agreed to participate in an electronically recorded interview. He made full admissions as to his responsibility for the construction and complete operation of the hydroponic system and possession of the other cannabis. The applicant told police that the cannabis drying in the garage had been freshly harvested from the outdoor plot. He admitted that he intended to package and sell that cannabis. He also admitted that the packaged cannabis in the bedroom had been harvested from the original crop of hydroponic plants grown before the existing crop found by police. He stated that the entire system had been established for the sole purpose of growing cannabis for sale and financial gain and that he hoped to make $10,000 from its sale.

14As to the plastic handgun, the applicant admitted that it was his. He said that he had owned it for many years. He did not know whether it worked and had never fired any projectile from it. 

15The applicant gave evidence at the proceedings on sentence in which he appeared to resile from his admissions to police that the cannabis had been cultivated for sale and financial gain. He said that, until about two months before the execution of the search warrant, he had been a heavy user of cannabis. He gave the following evidence:

Q. And essentially you'd told them that you were intending to sell the crop, do you remember saying that?
A. Yes I did say that but ..
Q. Why did you tell them that?
A. Well I was caught with so much and I just - I'd been in rehabilitation, I'd put myself in about two months before that and I just felt silly that I'd been caught with so much marijuana and I just didn't want to lie to them and if someone had've come along I probably would've sold it, I didn't know what else to say at the time, I was pretty flustered.

16He later reiterated that evidence, saying that he had no concrete plans set in place with a buyer; that he didn't even own a mobile phone and that he didn't know what he was planning to do but that he acknowledged he probably would have sold the cannabis ""if someone had have turned up with the money"". In response to a series of leading questions from his solicitor, he said that he had not in fact taken any steps to find a buyer and that the commercial purpose of the cultivation was, in that sense, hypothetical.

17The judge considered that evidence but was satisfied that a major purpose of the enterprise was financial, to raise money by selling the bulk of the proceeds of the crop for profit or financial gain. That finding was plainly open on the evidence and is not challenged (except perhaps obliquely) on the present application. His Honour made the obvious point that, if the offender had been meaning to give up cannabis, he would have had no personal use for the large quantity of plants found. Those findings informed his Honour's assessment of the overall criminality of the offending, which his Honour found entailed ""a sophisticated setup"" involving the deliberate and conscious bypassing of the electricity system. 

18As to the firearms offences, the judge was not satisfied that the possession of the gun was in any way related to the drug matters, evidently accepting what the applicant told police on that issue. His Honour regarded those offences as ""comparatively minor"".

19The judge noted that the applicant was 56 years of age and was in poor health. His Honour was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to any aggravating features of the offences. He accepted that the applicant was rehabilitating himself and had encouraging prospects in that respect. He took into account the plea of guilty and allowed the maximum discount of 25%. His Honour indicated that, but for the plea, the overall sentence would have been one of 4 years imprisonment. Applying the discount to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea, his Honour imposed an overall sentence of 3 years. His Honour determined not to accumulate the sentences in respect of the firearm. 

20The judge made a finding of special circumstances based on the fact that this would be the applicant's first custodial sentence and having regard to his poor health, which his Honour accepted would make custody ""somewhat more oppressive"" for him, together with the positive indications of rehabilitation. On the strength of that finding, his Honour fixed a non-parole period of 18 months, which is 50% of the aggregate sentence (compared with the statutory requirement in the absence of special circumstances of 75%). 

21For the firearms offences, his Honour imposed a fixed term of six months for each offence, to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed for the drug offence (which took into account the additional charges on the form 1).

22For reasons which will emerge, it is necessary to deal with the fourth ground of appeal first. Ground 4 is:

The sentencing judge erred in sentencing to a plea under s 23(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 

23Some explanation is required. The applicant was charged by means of a court attendance notice which alleged the commission of an offence contrary to s 23(1A) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. That section creates an offence of cultivating prohibited plants by enhanced indoor means for a commercial purpose. The section specifically applies where the number of plants is less than the commercial quantity, which was not the case here. The commercial quantity of cannabis plants cultivated by enhanced indoor means is 50. The number of plants cultivated by the applicant exceeded that, being 58 plants. It will be necessary to return to the significance of those matters.

24The applicant pleaded guilty to the offence alleged in the court attendance notice. That is, he admitted that he cultivated a number of prohibited plants by enhanced indoor means for a commercial purpose.

25In his remarks on sentence, the learned sentencing judge said:

The first offence was contrary to s 23(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act cultivating by enhanced indoor means a prohibited plant namely cannabis and the quantity was commercial because it exceeded fifty, not by very many but that is why it is commercial. The maximum penalty for that is fifteen years imprisonment and/or a fine.

26Ground 4 as articulated in the notice of appeal focuses on the fact that his Honour is recorded as having sentenced following a plea to an offence against s 23(1)(a) of the Act. At the hearing of the present application Mr Bassett, who appeared for the applicant, conceded that the reference in that passage of the remarks on sentence to ""s 23(1)(a)"" is probably a transcription error, since his Honour's remarks on sentence were delivered orally and the phrase ""section 23(1)(a)"", read aloud without punctuation, sounds the same as the phrase ""section 23(1A)"".

27Not withstanding that concession, which was fairly and properly made, some confusion remains. The Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act creates two separate but similar offences related to the commercial cultivation of prohibited plants. Pursuant to s 23(1A), it is an offence to cultivate prohibited plants by enhanced indoor means for a commercial purpose (my emphasis). As already noted, that offence expressly applies to the circumstance where the number of plants is fewer than the commercial quantity (which, for cannabis plants cultivated by enhanced indoor means, is 50).

28Separately, s 23(2)(a) creates an offence of cultivating a commercial quantity of prohibited plants (my emphasis). Thus in the case of cultivation of cannabis plants by enhanced indoor means, the Act criminalises (in separate sections) the cultivation of fewer than 50 plants for a commercial purpose and the cultivation of more than 50 plants, which attracts the characterisation of being commercial simply by reference to the number of plants. Significantly, each offence carries the same penalty being (in the case of cannabis plant) a fine of 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 15 years or both: see s 33(2) of the Act.

29In the present case, there were more than 50 plants and accordingly the applicant could have been charged with an offence of cultivating the commercial quantity (for cultivation by enhanced indoor means) of cannabis plants contrary to s 23(2) of the Act. 

30The fact that it was a case in fact involving more than 50 plants where that was not an element of the offence appears to have introduced a degree of confusion at the proceedings on sentence. The Crown opened by providing to the Court (among other things) the statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales in respect of sentences imposed for the offence described as ""s 23 - cultivate by enhanced indoor means prohibited plant (cannabis plant - commercial quantity)"", which describes s 23(2). 

31The applicant's legal representative then proceeded to lead evidence from the applicant directed to qualifying or resiling from his admissions to police concerning the commercial nature of the undertaking. According to the statement of facts (tendered by consent), the applicant had told police that he had harvested the cannabis from the outdoor plot with the intention of packaging and selling it; that the packaged cannabis located in the spare bedroom had been cultivated and packaged for the purpose of sale and that the entire system was established for the sole purpose of growing cannabis for sale and financial gain, with a self-imposed sales target of $10,000. 

32The applicant's evidence at the proceedings on sentence (to the effect that, in truth, he simply found himself with too many cannabis plants after ridding himself of his own addiction) would have been relevant to mitigate an offence under s 23(2), where the possession of more than 50 plants is taken to have a commercial aspect but is amenable to a more innocent explanation. However, that evidence potentially derogated from the applicant's plea to a charge under s 23(1A), since cultivation for a commercial purpose is an element of that offence and is taken to have been admitted by the plea of guilty.

33The transcript of the proceedings on sentence does not record counsel's addresses, but there was certainly no issue raised by the Crown during the evidence as to the appropriateness of relying on evidence potentially inconsistent with the plea.

34Those aspects of the conduct of the proceedings on sentence may, in turn, have introduced some measure of confusion in the mind of the sentencing judge, reflected in his Honour's statement that ""the quantity was commercial because it exceeded 50, not by very many but that is why it is commercial"". 

35To the extent that those remarks do reflect any confusion (which is by no means clear), I am nonetheless not persuaded that the sentencing judge was distracted from his proper task to any significant degree. As already noted, Parliament regards the cultivation of less than the commercial quantity of cannabis plants by enhanced indoor means concededly for a commercial purpose as being an offence of equal seriousness to the offence of cultivating the commercial quantity of cannabis plants by enhanced indoor means.

36The judge referred to the correct section and the correct maximum penalty. His Honour undertook a careful evaluation of the overall criminality of the offending. If there was any misapprehension, which may be doubted, it was evidently confined to the proposition that the element of commerciality derived from the number of plants, whereas that element derived from the applicant's own admission. In my view, ground 4 must be dismissed.

37Ground 1 is:

The sentencing judge erred in finding that the objective degree of seriousness of the offence was in the mid to high range and sentenced him on that basis.

38It is convenient to consider that ground together with ground 2, which is:

The sentencing judge gave undue weight to the factor that the appellant carried out the offences for commercial purposes 

39The judge did not make a finding in the terms expressed in ground 1. The applicant submitted that his Honour ""made such a finding without expressly stating so"". The basis on which it is said that might be inferred is not entirely clear. The applicant sought to sustain the submission with the contention in ground 2 that the judge gave undue weight to the commercial purpose of the enterprise. Mr Bassett submitted that, whilst the applicant had the ability to organise the production of the plants, he had ""no setup at all in relation to their commercial exploitation"". 

40The applicant further submitted that the judge ""gave no consideration to the fact that the number of plants being 58 was derived more by accident than a commercial design. The entire crop was cloned from between four and eight plants"".

41The principal difficulty with those contentions is that they overlook the plea which, as already noted, necessarily entailed an admission that the plants were cultivated for a commercial purpose. That was an admission as to the purpose for which the plants were cultivated. To suggest that the applicant's possession of more than 50 plants was merely a misfortune derogates from that admission. Even leaving aside that issue, I see no error in the judge's assessment of the overall criminality of the applicant's offending. His Honour's finding that the setup was sophisticated and involved deliberately bypassing the electricity system was plainly open. His Honour had appropriate regard to the fact that the Parliament has marked cultivation by indoor enhanced means as a very serious offence. I do not think there is any substance in those grounds.

42Ground 3 is:

Given that the number of plants was at the very lowest end of the threshold for commercial quantity, the sentence was at the high end for this threshold range under the Act and was harsh and severe.

43To the extent that this ground relies on the number of plants, it perpetuates the misconception considered above in respect of the other grounds. The applicant pleaded guilty to an offence an element of which is that his cultivation of the plants was for a commercial purpose. He in fact cultivated more than the number of plants required to establish the offence and, in any event, that is not the sole determinant of its seriousness. 

44To the extent that ground 3 is otherwise to be understood as a complaint that the sentence was manifestly excessive, in my view it must be rejected. The applicant submitted that the judge found that the maximum sentence for the cannabis offences including the electricity on form 1 was 5 years. The applicant appears to have understood that as a reference to the sentencing statistics considered by his Honour. In fact, it is clear from the remarks on sentence that his Honour was referring (correctly) to the fact that the maximum sentence for one of the electricity offences on the form 1 was 5 years.

45The sentencing statistics provided by Mr Bassett to this Court reveal that the present sentence was within the pattern of those statistics.

46Mr Bassett invited the Court to consider, as a comparable case, the decision of this Court in Zepina v R [2010] NSWCCA 155. I do not think that decision provides any support for the applicant's case. There the offender's operation, as with the applicant's in the present case, was described as being sophisticated; while the plants seized there numbered 37 in comparison with the 58 found in the applicant's garage. In both instances an early plea of guilty was entered resulting in the application of a 25% discount to the sentences imposed. In each case there was a finding of special circumstances allowing a departure from the statutory ratio resulting in a non-parole period equal to 50% of the aggregate sentence. Significantly, the two year and six month sentence the subject of appeal in Zepina was described by Whealy J (as his Honour then was) as a ""very lenient sentence indeed"". In view of that characterisation of the sentence imposed in what Mr Basset contended, and I accept to be, a comparable case, it can hardly be said that the sentence the subject of the present appeal fell outside, or was even towards the upper limits of, the permissible range for an offence of this type, especially when one considers that the applicant's operation had yielded a somewhat larger crop. 

47Separately, the applicant complains that, in making his finding of special circumstances such as to warrant reducing the ordinary ratio of the non-parole period to the balance of term, his Honour did not refer to the pre-sentence report. It is difficult to understand that complaint in circumstances where the non-parole period was 50%, rather than the usual 75%, of the total term imposed.

48I am not persuaded that the sentence entailed error. The orders I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

		30 May 2013",2013-05-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2761611,R v Ahmed [2013] NSWDC 323,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1I am sentencing Simon Ahmed because he was given a good behaviour bond by another judge but breached that good behaviour bond and I have to re-sentence him for that breach.  I am also sentencing him for some seven other offences that he committed.  Those seven other offences amounted to a breach of the good behaviour bond; but still I need to sentence him separately for those offences.  
2I should look first at the offence that he received the good behaviour bond for.  On 15 October 2010 Simon Ahmed was before his Honour Judge Garling of this Court.  His Honour's remarks on sentence indicate that Mr Ahmed was in Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross when the police searched his car and found six small resealable bags.  They were found to contain just over 5 grams of cocaine.  The prosecution before Judge Garling indicated that the case was not one which should carry full-time custody and could warrant a bond.  Accordingly his Honour put Mr Ahmed on a good behaviour bond for 2 years.  
3However not halfway through those 2 years Mr Ahmed committed a series of offences over a few days.  They occurred from 2 to 3 August 2011 and then on 8 August 2011.  
4Briefly what happened is this.  A car had been stolen.  Mr Ahmed was not part of the original theft, but between 1 and 2 August 2011 he joined two other offenders in Brighton-Le-Sands where they stole some number plates from another car.  They put those number plates onto the original stolen car.  Then in that stolen car, knowing it to be stolen, he was driven to the Botany Bay Water Police complex at Sans Souci.  There Mr Ahmed and one of the co offenders forced open the sliding gate and got in.  That action damaged the gate.  They then smashed the rear window of a police car in the compound and removed a radio box and some police vests.  Hardly surprisingly, they were seen by the police.  Mr Ahmed got away in the stolen car with one of the other co offenders.  The second co offender was arrested.  
5Interestingly, the car which had originally been stolen (the theft not involving Mr Ahmed) had a listening device fixed to it and the police were able to determine, by listening, that one of the co offenders was identified ""as the primary speaker within the vehicle and the one giving directions"" to Mr Ahmed and the other co offender.  
6That activity which I have described so far gave rise to a charge of stealing the number plates, of knowingly being carried in a stolen car, of damaging property and of theft of the material from the police car.  It also gave rise to an offence of unlawful entry on inclosed lands.  
7On 3 August the stolen car turned up at Mr Ahmed's house and he got in and was then carried around again in the stolen car, hence giving rise to another offence of knowingly being carried.  
8The police tracked down Mr Ahmed and searched his house.  They found a replica pistol and nunchucks and a small amount of cannabis.  He was therefore charged with possessing a prohibited weapon (the nunchucks) and possession of an unauthorised firearm (the replica pistol).  He was also charged with possessing a prohibited drug.  He was arrested on 16 August 2011. 
9That offence of possessing a prohibited drug and the unlawful entry into the police compound are two offences which I am not sentencing Mr Ahmed for, but he has asked me to take them into account when I am sentencing him for the offence of possessing an unauthorised firearm.  He has signed a form in accordance with s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and I will take those offences into account when I am sentencing him for that offence.  I too now sign the form to that effect. 
10The supply of a prohibited drug, which Judge Garling had sentenced Mr Ahmed for, is an offence against s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).  Parliament has fixed a maximum of 15 years imprisonment to that offence.  
11The various larceny offences which arose from stealing the number plates and stealing things from the police car are offences against s 117 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and have a maximum of 5 years imprisonment.  The charges of being knowingly carried in a stolen car are offences against s 154A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, and again Parliament has fixed a maximum of 5 years imprisonment to that offence.  The charge of intentionally damaging property, which arose from breaking into the police compound, is an offence against s 195(1)(a) and carries a maximum of 5 years imprisonment.  
12The two offences to do with what was found in Mr Ahmed's home are more serious.  Possession of the replica pistol was an offence against s 7A(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) and has a maximum of 14 years imprisonment.  The possession of the prohibited weapon, the nunchucks, is an offence against s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW).  It too has a maximum 14 years imprisonment.  Not only that, but Parliament regards that offence so seriously that it has fixed a standard non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment. 
13I formally convict Mr Ahmed of the offences in August 2011 involving larceny and knowingly being carried in the stolen car, damaging property and the offences under the Weapons Prohibition Act and the Firearms Act.  
14As well as referring to what an offender did which amounted to the crimes that a Court is sentencing the offender for, the Court takes into account matters which are personal to the offender.  In this case I am assisted by two pre sentence reports and some other material which was tendered on his behalf.  
15Before considering that, I should make reference to the fact that Mr Ahmed has a criminal record.  He is now 33 and has some entries for offences committed before he turned 18 and when he was dealt with by the Children's Court.  He has similar offences to the ones he is in trouble for now, being carried in a stolen car and entering inclosed lands and goods in custody, as well as carrying a cutting instrument.  He received bonds and probation for those offences.  
16When he was 19 he came before the District Court on a charge of supplying a prohibited drug.  He was given a 3 year gaol term with a non parole period of 1 year.  That was in 2000.  He abandoned an appeal against that sentence.  Apart from a driving offence, he did not come to the attention of the Courts again until his Honour Judge Garling dealt with him in 2010.  Hence he had about 10 years where he did not re-offend.  
17I return now to the material which relates to Mr Ahmed personally.  The pre sentence report dated 22 November 2012 noted his family history and an injury which he had received to his lower back and his ankle.  It noted a history of drug use, but also noted that he claimed that the type of offences he committed were ""out of character"".  That is hardly the case given his record in the Children's Court.  
18His injuries, which occurred in 2008 and 2010, required surgery.  He has needed assistance and support from a psychologist.  He apparently had commenced using cannabis in his early twenties.  Although he had periods of abstinence, he returned to it whilst he was incapacitated from his injuries.  It noted that he had engaged ""satisfactorily in alcohol and drug counselling"".  The author thought that he would not need supervision because of his progress with a counsellor, whom he was referred to. 
19An updated report dated 29 May 2013 noted Mr Ahmed's progress with the psychologist and noted that he had ""made significant improvements to his lifestyle and continues to be committed to his individual counselling to address his symptoms of depression and anxiety.""  It noted that he has gained employment and had been doing some voluntary work which he had to discontinue because of his mental health.  Again the report said that he was unlikely to require supervision and was unsuitable for community service.  
20There was a report from psychologist whom he saw.  Her name is Elizabeth Munro.  Mr Bunton, who appeared for Mr Ahmed, tendered that report.  The report noted that he had been referred by his doctor under a mental health care plan and commenced therapy with her on 10 October 2011.  The treatment focused on a number of issues which would be of assistance to him.  Once again it noted that Mr Ahmed described his offending as ""errors of judgment"".  Nevertheless it confirmed his regular attendance.  
21There is a note from Pastor Brian Unterrheiner from the Newtown Mission which noted that Mr Ahmed had been doing voluntary work in the kitchen since June last year.  In addition there was a letter from his employer who noted that he works as a driver for six days a week and the employer said that he had ""become a vital part of our working team"".  The employer observed that he had seen ""Simon rise from an unemployed, unqualified and minimal skilled candidate when I first hired him to an outstanding delivery driver who takes great pride and care in his work, he is always punctual, always willing to go that extra mile and is a loyal individual.""  The author of that note, Ian Harris, realistically said that although he had known Mr Ahmed for only a year and was unable to judge whether the behaviour was out of character, he could ""strongly say that he has definitely changed into a totally different person than that described of him in the charge sheet over the last year"".  He said that he would continue to be employed by that company.  There is a reference from Joanne Devine, a widow who said how much Mr Ahmed had been helpful to her during her husband's illness and was a great comfort to Mrs Devine's son. 
22What I need to do is to re sentence Mr Ahmed for the drug supply offence and for the other offences which were committed in August 2011.  Mr Robinson, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, pointed out that of course Mr Ahmed was on a bond when he committed the second lot of offences.  That was the good behaviour bond which Judge Garling had imposed.  He had committed those offences before the first year of the 2 year good behaviour bond expired.  Mr Robinson pointed to the fact that Mr Ahmed had already spent time in gaol for a drug supply offence in 2000.  He argued that there was no evidence of contrition because there was no evidence that he accepted responsibility for his offending.  I think Mr Robinson is right in all those submissions which he makes.  He drew my attention to the standard non-parole period attached to the prohibited weapon offence and the significant maximum penalties for the two offences regarding what had been found in Mr Ahmed's home.  He observed, as did Judge Garling, that the sentence - the bond - was a lenient sentence for a drug supply which admittedly did involve a possession for supply.  
23Mr Robinson argued that the only appropriate penalty was one of fulltime custody.  He urged me to look at the totality of Mr Ahmed's offending.  Looking at each individual offence may produce reduced sentences or non custodial sentences but the totality of the offending warrants fulltime custody.  There should be some partial accumulation in respect of the sentences for the offences committed in August 2011.
24Mr Bunton pointed to his client's early plea of guilty which he said was the earliest available opportunity and I accept that submission.  He pointed to the psychological material and it demonstrating a willingness for his client to rehabilitate himself.  He pointed to the chronology involved.  His client had spent some time in custody - about a month and a week - after he was arrested for the 2011 offences in late August 2011.  Then he was having his first appointment with the psychologist in early October.  He secured a job in April 2012 and commenced his voluntary work in June 2012.
25As Mr Bunton said, his client was gradually taking up options to get his life back on track.  It was on his client's release that he took the progressive steps towards his own rehabilitation.  He acknowledged the force of Mr Robinson's argument about totality but said that the sentences for the spate of offending over August 2011 could be in terms of months rather than years.
26The factors which I take into account and regard as significant are these.  There was a relatively small amount of the drug involved in the matter that Judge Garling was dealing with.  It seems to me that the next step should be a sentence of imprisonment but I would regard it as appropriate to suspend that sentence.  I also take into account that although he had troubled teenage years, his first significant offence was at the age of 19 and then there was a long gap of some 10 years before the offences that I am sentencing him for.  I take into account the evidence in the agreed facts that Mr Ahmed was evidently not the ringleader of the offending behaviour that occurred in August 2011.  
27I also take into account the significant developments which occurred on his release on bail.  I accept Mr Bunton's submissions about the progress which he said his client has made.  I accept that there was a spate of offending behaviour over a confined period of a few days.  There were a lot of offences but none of them itself was outstandingly serious.  Mr Ahmed has significant physical and mental health issues to deal with.  He is in the process of rehabilitating himself in the community by the progress he has made in counselling and by the employment he has received.  
28What I propose to do is to impose sentences for the spate of offending but to suspend those sentences and I propose to fix a sentence for the two crimes involved in what had been found at his house which coincides with the time he has already spent in custody.  I will impose an aggregate sentence in respect of the offences which occurred in August 2011 apart from the offences to do with what was found in Mr Ahmed's home.  I will now sentence your client.  If you would stand up Mr Ahmed.  
29I am satisfied that you have failed to comply with the conditions or the good behaviour condition of the bond imposed by Judge Garling.  I revoke the bond.  In respect of that offence I sentence you to 18 months imprisonment and under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole of the period.  I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for 18 months.  
HIS HONOUR:  Mr Robinson and Mr Bunton I want you both to be thinking about the conditions because I'll ask you in a moment.
30In respect of the offences of two larcenies, two being carried in a conveyance and one damage to property, I regard an appropriate overall sentence as being 2 years imprisonment.  Because you pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity I would discount that by 25% so that the overall sentence for that is 18 months imprisonment.  
31I need to indicate to you how that would be made up individually.  In respect of the first larceny I would regard an appropriate sentence as 6 months imprisonment.  In respect of the carriage in the conveyance, the first one, I would regard an appropriate sentence as 6 months imprisonment accumulated by 3 months.  In respect to the damage to property, I would regard an appropriate sentence as three months accumulated again by 3 months.  In respect of the second larceny, I would regard an appropriate sentence being 6 months, accumulated by 3 months.  In respect of the second illegal carriage in a conveyance, I would regard an appropriate sentence as being 6 months, accumulated by 3 months.  That is a total of 18 months taking into account your plea of guilty.  
32Under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to those offences I have just listed, instead of a separate sentence of imprisonment.  That aggregate sentence is one of 18 months imprisonment.  Under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for 18 months and I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for 18 months.
33In respect of the offence of possessing an unauthorised firearm and taking into account the two matters which you have asked me to take into account, I impose a fixed term sentence of 1 month and 8 days which commenced on 16 August 2011 until 23 September 2011.  
34In respect of the prohibited weapon offence and bearing in mind that it carries a standard non-parole period amongst the other factors I take into account, I regard that as an appropriate matter for a fixed term penalty which I fix as 1 month and 8 days commencing 16 August 2011 and expiring on 23 September 2011.  Those sentences are obviously concurrent.
HIS HONOUR:  Now conditions of the good behaviour bond.  Obviously good behaviour.  I am not going to ask him to be supervised unless either of you thinks I should but I do not want to burden Probation and Parole when they have made it clear that they do not think that he would benefit.  Should I do anything about the psychologist?  I don't think so.ROBINSON:  Your Honour, I wouldn't urge upon your Honour to include it as a condition and that is something he can just simply attend to himself separately.HIS HONOUR:  I agree.  Mr Bunton, do you agree?BUNTON:  Yes, your Honour, I do.HIS HONOUR:  Yes, all right.
35The conditions of both good behaviour bonds are the same.  
(1)That you be of good behaviour.  (2)That you notify the Registrar of this Court of any change in your residential address.  (3)That if you receive a notice to attend Court that you attend.
36Mr Ahmed, I thought overnight about this case.  It troubled me.  In a way you should go to gaol and that is, in fact, why I have imposed prison sentences but I have suspended them and that is mainly because of the progress that you have made with the psychologist and with the job and getting yourself back on track, okay?  I think that if I sent you back into gaol it would reverse that process. 
37Now, for the drug supply, I have given you an 18 month prison sentence and suspended that.  For all that activity you took part in with Mr Andrews and the other fellow and the cars and the police compound, I have given you an overall sentence of 18 months imprisonment.  Once again I have suspended that.  For the nunchuckers and the replicate pistol which they found at your home, I have given you prison sentences for both of those because they both carry a high maximum and one of them has a standard non-parole period and the other I am taking into account the other offences but you have served that sentence.  I fixed that the same as the time you spent in prison without bail.  So that is over and done with.  
38There are conditions for your bond, three of them.  You have got to stay out of trouble.  If you change your address, you have got to write to the Registrar here and let him know and the third one is if you get a notice from the Court to tell you to come to Court, you turn up rather than having the police and the sheriff's officers chasing you.
39There is something you have got to understand which Mr Bunton will have explained to you or perhaps he is going to or both.  A suspended sentence bond is quite different to the other kinds of bonds.  The bond you got from Judge Garling is one kind of bond.  The bond that I have given you is attached to a suspended sentence and it is different.  If you breach this bond, the suspended sentence bond, it is very hard not to go to gaol.  The judge pretty well has to send you to gaol and I have decided that is the way to go because these are prison sentence offences and it is really up to you.  You have shown very well how you can get yourself back on track in the last couple of years and I am going to give you a chance but that sword is hanging over your head and it will not be like this time when you breached the good behaviour bond and I have given you a suspended sentence.  If you come back before me, my hands are tied and it will just be a matter of how long of that 18 months you serve.  Do you understand that?
OFFENDER:  Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR:  Mr Bunton will explain it to you again but it is very important that you understand that.  If you mess up, you will go in.  All right?OFFENDER:  Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR:  Have a seat Mr Ahmed.  Mr Robinson, what did you want to--ROBINSON:  Yes, your Honour, just a few things.  Your Honour, just in relation to the standard non-parole period offence, it is my understanding that your Honour cannot fix a fixed term for that offence, there must be a non-parole period imposed.  I am happy to be corrected on that point.  There was a case in the last 18 months on that.HIS HONOUR:  I think you are right.ROBINSON:  So to achieve what your Honour intends to achieve, I think your Honour would need to do it another way, whether your Honour imposes a s 12 bond or takes a different course but I'm quite confident in saying that there must be a non-parole period fixed in relation to that.HIS HONOUR:  Yes, I think you are right.  What are my options?ROBINSON:  Your Honour could also place the offender on a s 12 bond, thereby you do not need to fix a non-parole period if there is no breach of course of that bond.  That is an option your Honour has but I think your Honour just simply cannot fix a fixed term for a standard non-parole period offence.HIS HONOUR:  And I cannot say make it two months with a three weeks on parole because that is artificial.  I do not think that would work.  No, because effectively he has been on - no.ROBINSON:  Effectively, your Honour, that was a back date.  Well, that period was sometime ago as well.HIS HONOUR:  No, I do not think I can do it, I think you are right.ROBINSON:  I do not think that is possible.  The only other way, your Honour, would be s 10A which is a conviction with no further penalty but again--HIS HONOUR:  No, but it is too serious an offence.ROBINSON:  That is what I would have said, your Honour, so.
40I will re-open the sentence under s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  I do not need to hear from you, Mr Bunton.  Mr Robinson has correctly drawn my attention to the fact that the penalty for an offence which has a standard non-parole period fixed to it cannot be a fixed sentence.  I have purported to do that.  I think in order to achieve the objective which I have set out to achieve I will need to suspend that sentence.  I am reluctant to do so because of the seriousness of the offence and the seriousness with which Parliament regards it but I take into account the period which Mr Ahmed spent bail refused in fixing a sentence for that matter.  I fix a sentence of 1 month and 8 days.
HIS HONOUR:  Can I back date a suspended sentence?ROBINSON:  No, your Honour.BUNTON:  No, your Honour.
41I fix a sentence of 1 month and under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for the month and I direct that Mr Ahmed be released on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for one month and the conditions of that bond are the same as the conditions for the other bonds.
HIS HONOUR:  Does that deal with that?ROBINSON:  It does, your Honour.BUNTON:  Those sentences are concurrent, your Honour, I take it?HIS HONOUR:  Yes.ROBINSON:  Thank you and your Honour, just two final matters.  One is, your Honour, there are two matters on a 166 certificate.  They were placed on the Form 1.  I would ask your Honour simply to confirm those matters were taken into account.  Thank you.
42I confirm that the matters which are on the certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) are the ones which I took into account under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
ROBINSON:  Thank you, your Honour.  Just finally, your Honour, I would seek the Court make a drug destruction order in relation to the small amount of cannabis that was found.
43The amount of cannabis which Mr Robinson has referred to, I direct that that be destroyed under s 39P of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.
ROBINSON:  Thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR:  Anything else?ROBINSON:  No, your Honour.BUNTON:  No, your Honour.
44Mr Ahmed, I changed the gaol sentence for the nunchuckers.  I had to as Mr Robinson, the Prosecutor, pointed out because I cannot set a fixed term so I have made that 1 month and suspended it.  You got off very lightly with that but otherwise it would have frustrated what I was going to do.  Just have a seat, Mr Ahmed.

2761615,R v Venios [2013] NSWDC 116,"Judgment

1I last dealt with the offender Mr Venios in October last year. In the remarks that I delivered that day I described the terrible crime that he had committed with a co-offender Mervyn Hickey. What he did was cruel, nasty and unbelievably selfish. He was short of money, he wanted to get some money and so he and his co-offender took advantage of the extreme vulnerability of a woman who had had the misfortune to win some money on a poker machine. Mr Venios gave evidence today that he was not proud of what he had done and so does not like talking about it. I can quite understand that because this is one of the nastiest offences with which I have ever dealt, taking advantage of the extreme vulnerability of Ms McCaffrey.

2As I mentioned on the last occasion ordinarily that would mean that he would go to gaol and go to gaol for a significant period of time. Indeed his cooffender, whose circumstances differ significantly from that of Mr Venios received a sentence of six years with a non-parole period of three years. But when Mr Venios did appear before me there were suggestions that he was capable of rehabilitating himself. Over the Crown's objection I adjourned the matter under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in order that Mr Venios could demonstrate rehabilitation to me rather than just promise it. 

3I told him that if he wanted to avoid going back to gaol he would need an A grade pass. Over the ensuing period Mr Venios has achieved a great deal. He was not working at the time he first came before me but he soon got a job as a apprentice carpenter and when he lost that job because of a downturn in work, he got a job as an appliance installer with a Retro Vision franchisee. He has that job at present working Tuesday to Saturday, nine to five. A reference from his employer was tendered to me today which speaks highly of his work. He told his employer that he needed this reference for court but did not tell her the nature of the offence for which the reference was required.

4As well as getting a job, Mr Venios did something else I required of him. He has not used drugs and regular urinalysis obtained at his expense has demonstrated that. He also has not committed any further offence. Those three circumstances suggests that Mr Venios has achieved a great deal over the last few months. Madam Crown criticises him for not attending NA meetings every week and for failing to attend a psychological counsellor as often as she would prefer but I accept that a lot of the difficulties with seeing a counsellor arise because of Mr Venios' work and given that he has not used drugs one might be forgiven for thinking that it is less important to go to Narcotics Anonymous than would otherwise be the case.

5Perhaps it is not an A plus pass but he has done more than most people who have been given the opportunity, to demonstrate rehabilitation. 

6I do not think I mentioned on the last occasion but Mr Venios pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so is entitled to a discount of twentyfive per cent to reflect that circumstance. He has expressed his remorse and accepted responsibility for what he has done. He gave evidence of that himself and evidence called from his partner and a friend also was to that effect. 

7He spent fourteen days in gaol and then ten months in a form of quasi custody. Not all forms of quasi custody are the same. A judge of this Court was recently criticised by the Court of Criminal Appeal for saying that before quasi custody could be taken into account the conditions had to be similar to that of a prison. That is certainly not the case, but some forms of residential rehabilitation involve less restriction on an individual's liberty than others. As I noted on the last occasion Mr Venios was able to leave his residential rehabilitation on the weekend and one day each week. Indeed it was during such a permitted absence that he breached one of the important rules of the facility by getting drunk, a circumstance which became known to the facility when he fell over and broke his arm. That was one of the factors that led to him being asked to leave. Another was that he formed a relationship with a young woman also at that facility. 

8In circumstances where the offender was asked to leave residential rehabilitation because of breaches of its rules and in circumstances where the restrictions on his liberty were not as severe as other forms of quasi custody, although I will take into account that matter, it is of less significance than in other cases.

9The offender was twenty when he committed this offence and is now twentyone. A counsellor from the rehabilitation facility was contacted by the Crown and she described Mr Venios as immature and said that dealing with him was like dealing with a twelve year old. Ms Goodwin for Mr Venios got quite upset when that description was given without realising that, at least at that stage, the immaturity of an offender can be an important part in assessing a sentence to impose upon him or her.

10There is no bright line when a person moves from being an immature child to a mature adult. The fact that Mr Venios is an immature person, or at least was a little while ago, suggests that as he matures there is much less likelihood that he will ever commit another offence. He has no other criminal offences on his history, nothing before this offence and as I mentioned nothing after it. The evidence suggests quite strongly that this will be a very isolated and singular breach of the criminal law by Mr Venios.

11Some mention has been made of the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R. That judgment came about because of a perception, and indeed the reality, that sentences for armed robbery needed to be generally increased and that there was an unacceptable variation between judicial officers as to sentencing for that offence. What the guideline judgment was never intended to do was to impose a straightjacket on judicial officers. It remains the case that if justice is not individual it is nothing. 

12As I have said on more than one occasion the ultimate purpose of sentencing is to protect the community. It is my job to fashion orders which, as far as I can, reduce the risk that other victims such as Ms McCaffrey will suffer from such horrible crimes in the future. It is my job to do what I can to ensure that other people are not harmed as Ms McCaffrey clearly was. Ordinarily that purpose is achieved by imposing lengthy and sometimes harsh sentences. No doubt that is what Ms McCaffrey is hoping will happen to Mr Venios, I probably would in her position too. She, more than anyone else here today, knows how significantly she has been affected by this nasty crime but sometimes, and this is one occasion, attention should be focused more on rehabilitation of an individual offender than deterring other offenders. 

13If what I can achieve is a continuation of Mr Venios' rehabilitation, such that he does not commit further offences in the future, then to that extent society benefits. I accept of course that a sentence which focuses on an offender's rehabilitation often does so at the expense of deterring others from committing crimes and so there is of course a balancing exercise as to which approach is most beneficial. In this case I have decided to focus on Mr Venios' rehabilitation because I have drawn the conclusion that that is what will be best for society. It will be noted that I am not saying that is what will be best for Mr Venios. Whether it is or not is somewhat beside the point. It is other people like Ms McCaffrey that I am thinking about when I say that the best approach in this case is to focus on Mr Venios' rehabilitation.

14Taking into account his time in custody and quasi custody has meant that I have reached a conclusion that a sentence of imprisonment of two years or less is likely to be imposed. 

15Before I get to that I did mean to mention issues regarding Mr Venios' mental health. This offence was committed at somewhat of a low point in Mr Venios' life. He was going downhill and using drugs to excess which directly led to this offence. He suffers from a number of mental illnesses which together had the effect that his moral culpability for this offence is lower than it would otherwise have been. The relationship between his mental illnesses and his offending means that if his mental illnesses can be dealt with then his prospects for rehabilitation are enhanced.

16I return to the appropriate order in this case. Having determined that a sentence of two years or less is likely, I have also determined that it would be appropriate to assess Mr Venios as to his suitability to serve that sentence by way of an intensive corrections order.

17 The matter is adjourned to 2 o'clock on 9 August 2013. Mr Venios' bail is to continue. He is to cooperate with the Corrective Services authorities in the preparation of the intensive corrections order and he is to continue on the same bail conditions, and that includes of course the regular urinalysis.


18ADJOURNED TO FRIDAY 9 AUGUST 2013 AT 2PM
