 District Judge Kenneth Choo:
Introduction
1       On 31 July 2011, the plaintiff, who was riding a motorcycle, was involved in a collision with a car driven by the defendant. As a result thereof, the plaintiff sustained physical injuries and her motorcycle was damaged. The plaintiff sought damages against the defendant for her personal injuries and consequential losses. At the end of trial, I gave judgment in her favour, finding the defendant wholly to blame for the accident. The defendant has now appealed.
2       The trial before me was on liability only. Hence, the issue to be determined is whether the plaintiff or the defendant was to blame for the accident. If both were negligent, then the subsidiary issue would be how liability between them is to be apportioned.
Factual background
3       The accident occurred on 31 July 2011 at about 10.30pm. It took place inside the traffic-light controlled cross-junction of Bedok South Avenue 1 and Upper East Coast Road (“the Junction”). The plaintiff was riding her motorcycle (FBD 7339H) (“the Motorcycle”) with Mr Danny bin Abdullah @ Shamsudin bin Sapari (“Danny”), her then boyfriend (now husband), riding pillion. The plaintiff was travelling along Bedok South Avenue 1 heading towards New Upper Changi Road and was proceeding straight across the Junction.
4       At the material time, the defendant was driving motor car (SBY 8081H) (“the Car”). He was travelling from the opposite direction along Bedok South Avenue 1 with the intention of making a right turn at the Junction into Upper East Coast Road in the direction of East Coast Road. The plaintiff’s then girlfriend (now wife), Ms Li Yu Xuan, Ting (“Li”), was the front-seat passenger in the Car.
5       The collision occurred inside the Junction while the Motorcycle was proceeding across it and the Car was making a right turn. The plaintiff and Danny were both flung off the Motorcycle and sustained injuries.
6       Entering the Junction from the East Coast Parkway (“ECP”) expressway in the direction that the plaintiff was riding, there were three lanes on Bedok South Avenue 1 towards New Upper Changi Road. The right-most lane was exclusively for vehicles turning right and the other two lanes were for vehicles proceeding straight only.
7       In the opposite direction and heading towards the ECP expressway, which was the direction the defendant had been travelling on prior to the turn at the Junction, there were also three lanes. Similarly, the right most lane was exclusively for vehicles turning right into Upper East Coast Road from Bedok South Avenue 1. There was a turning pocket along the right-most lane. The remaining two lanes were for vehicles proceeding straight only towards the ECP expressway. Both turning lanes from opposite directions face each other directly across the Junction.
[note: ]
8       It was common ground that, at the material time, the weather was clear, the road surface was dry, traffic volume was moderate and the traffic lights at the Junction were functioning normally.
9       After the Traffic Police conducted their investigations, there was no police action initiated against either the plaintiff or the defendant.
[note: i]
10     It was also not in dispute that Li’s mother was the owner of the Car. Further, due to an inadvertent lapse, there was unfortunately no third-party insurance coverage in relation to the use of the Car at the material time.
[note: ii]
11     As stated earlier, Danny was also injured in the accident. He instituted separate proceedings in DC 3892/2013 against the plaintiff, who subsequently brought in the defendant herein as a Third Party in those proceedings.
[note: iii]
 Notwithstanding these separate actions, the parties (including Danny) have appropriately agreed to be bound by the findings of fact made in these proceedings.
12     The main dispute between the parties is on the question of who had the right of way, i.e. in whose favour the traffic lights were at the material time.
The parties’ accounts
The plaintiff’s evidence
13     At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was a 23 year old staff nurse.
14     In her affidavit, the plaintiff stated that, on 31 July 2011 at about 10.30pm, she was riding the Motorcycle and travelling in the second lane of a three-lane carriageway being Bedok South Avenue 1, heading towards New Upper Changi Road. As she passed the Junction, the defendant’s Car, which was travelling from the opposite direction of Bedok South Avenue 1, made a sudden right turn at the Junction and collided into the right side of the Motorcycle, causing the plaintiff and Danny to fall off the Motorcycle. The plaintiff further affirmed that, at the material time, the traffic lights were showing green in her favour and she therefore proceeded to ride through the Junction as she had right of way.
[note: iv]
15     During cross-examination, the plaintiff gave further evidence as follows:
(a)     When the plaintiff approached the Junction, she was travelling in the centre of the second lane of Bedok South Avenue 1 heading towards New Upper Changi Road at a speed of about 40 km/h;
[note: v]
(b)     As she was approaching the Junction, she confirmed that there was a car travelling one car length in front of her. She could not recall seeing any cars on her right side. She could not see what was in front of the car ahead of her but she could see on the left and right of the said car.
[note: vi]
(c)     She was unable to confirm whether, due to the impact of the collision, Danny was flung off the Motorcycle over her as she claimed to be half awake and half drowsy due to the amount of blood she lost.
[note: vii]
(d)     As she entered the Junction, she saw the defendant’s car which was stationary in the turning pocket.
[note: viii]
 She also confirmed that the traffic lights were green in her favour.
[note: ix]
 The plaintiff maintained her speed at about 40 km/h when she was in the Junction just before impact.
[note: x]
(e)     As she was half-way through the Junction, the defendant’s Car travelling from the opposite direction from Bedok South Avenue 1 made a sudden right turn and collided into the right side of the Motorcycle. According to the plaintiff, the point of impact was at the middle right side of the Motorcycle where her right leg was positioned. She confirmed that most of the impact was absorbed by her right leg.
[note: xi]
Danny’s evidence
16     Danny gave evidence for the plaintiff at the trial. Danny in his affidavit gave an account largely similar to that given by the plaintiff in her affidavit. In particular, he confirmed that the traffic lights were in favour of the plaintiff.
[note: xii]
17     In court, Danny corroborated the plaintiff’s account and gave the following further evidence:
[note: xiii]
(a)     There were cars travelling in front of the Motorcycle although Danny was unable to see in front of those cars.
(b)     As Danny was riding pillion behind the plaintiff, he indicated that certain angles of his front view were blocked but he had a good view of the sides. He also stated that as he was a tall person, his view of the front was not entirely obstructed.
(c)     He stated that the traffic lights were green in the plaintiff’s favour and that the traffic lights were located at the left side of his view. Danny confirmed that the plaintiff was travelling at a speed of about 30 – 40 km/h along the second lane of the three-lane carriageway.
(d)     They were half-way through the Junction when the defendant’s Car collided into the Motorcycle. Danny lost consciousness after the collision and sustained injuries.
The defendant’s evidence
18     At the material time of the accident, the defendant and Li, both school teachers, were on their way home from Great World City.
19     The defendant made a traffic accident report on 2 August 2011, two days after the accident. His statement in the said report is reproduced in full below:
[note: xiv]
“On the above mentioned date and time I was driving along Bedok South Ave 1. I wanted to make a right turn to upper east coast road, my vehicle was in stationary position on the most outer lane, once the green arrow lit up, I checked and noticed that there’s no oncoming traffic and gradually increase my speed, whilst turning, a m/cycle suddenly dashed straight ahead and hit onto my front right bumper. Upon impact, both the rider and pillion were thrown off from their m/cycle. I completed my turn and stop at the side of the road to render assistance to the rider and pillion. Eye-witness called the ambulance. Ambulance soon arrived and both the rider and pillion was conveyed to the hospital. The traffic police arrived after the ambulance had left. That’s all.”
20     During cross-examination, the defendant testified that:
(a)     Although he was informed by the police after the accident that he was driving without insurance coverage, the defendant made his report two days after the accident as he was given a summons by the police to attend at the station. He also confirmed that he did not discuss the case with anyone else prior to making the report.
[note: xv]
(b)     Notwithstanding the fact that his affidavit did not explicitly state the words “green arrow”, the defendant testified that he made the right turn after the green filter arrow of the traffic lights lit up in his favour and the lights were red against traffic going straight in both directions. According to the defendant, there “was a car in the middle that stopped and the right most lane (from my angle/perspective) there was also a car stopped at the stop line”. The defendant also stated that he could not recall if there was any car turning from the opposite direction.
[note: xvi]
 For convenience, assuming we adopt the defendant’s perspective from the opposite side of the Junction, I shall refer to the lanes, counting from the right side of the opposite road as lane 1 being the right-most lane and lane 2 being the middle lane. The turning lane will be referred to as lane 3.
(c)     When he observed that it was safe to turn, the defendant “moved very slowly” for a “short distance” of 2 – 3 m when suddenly the Motorcycle dashed from behind the two stationary cars (i.e. in between the two cars at lanes 1 and 2 from the opposite direction) and crashed into the front right side of the Car. The defendant asserted that the speed that the plaintiff was travelling at was at least 70 km/h.
[note: xvii]
(d)     The defendant confirmed that the point of impact was more than half-way across the Junction, i.e. the plaintiff had travelled half-way across the Junction before the collision.
[note: xviii]
(e)     When questioned about the eye witness referred to in his statement, the defendant stated that there were at least two eye witnesses who approached him but he did not take down their contact numbers because he was emotionally traumatised. He also stated that one architect gave the defendant his name card but the architect’s wife took the name card back.
[note: xix]
Li’s evidence
21     Li gave evidence in support of the defendant at the trial. Her evidence was generally consistent with the defendant’s account save for certain discrepancies. I shall deal with and elaborate on these inconsistencies at [44] below.
Reasoning
The objective evidence supported the plaintiff’s account
22     The plaintiff has consistently maintained before and during trial (in her affidavit, in her traffic police report and at trial) that the front right bumper area of the Car collided into the right side of the Motorcycle.
[note: xx]
23     First, the plaintiff contended that the vehicle damage report of the plaintiff’s Motorcycle produced by the police
[note: xxi]
 show that apart from its front wheel (which was badly damaged), the damage to the Motorcycle was also mainly on its right side. There was damage to the fork (which was broken), the right hand mirror was cracked and there were scratches and dents to the right pedal and right exhaust. The vehicle damage report of the defendant’s Car
[note: xxii]
 show that the damage to the Car was to the front right bumper area which was crumpled. I therefore agreed with plaintiff’s submission that both damage reports are therefore consistent with the plaintiff’s version.
24     Second, I found the coloured photographs (showing both the damage to the vehicles and the accident scene) and the Traffic Police sketch plan to be pertinent evidence. My finding that the damage was more prevalent on the right side of the Motorcycle as opposed to its left side was supported by a visual inspection of the coloured photographs of the damaged Motorcycle.
[note: xxiii]
 For completeness, the coloured photographs also show that the license plate of the defendant’s Car was ripped off due to the collision.
[note: xxiv]
 More importantly, from the coloured photographs of the accident scene and the Traffic Police sketch plan, one would note that the final resting position of the Motorcycle was on its left side.
[note: xxv]
 Hence, it was unlikely that the damage to the right side of the Motorcycle was caused by contact against the road. Further, as may be gleaned from the same photographs and sketch plan, the final resting position of the plaintiff’s Motorcycle was situated along Upper East Coast Road towards Bedok Road (near the right turning pocket) and after the divider dividing traffic travelling in opposite directions, i.e. the Motorcycle ended up some two lanes to the left of the plaintiff’s intended path of travel. In my view, this was consistent with the plaintiff’s account of an impact coming from the right.
25     Third, the plaintiff’s own injuries were consistent with her version of events. As stated earlier, the plaintiff testified during trial that the point of impact between the Car and the Motorcycle was at the middle right side of the Motorcycle where her right leg was positioned and that most of the impact was absorbed by her right leg. I found her assertion credible given that she suffered multiple injuries on the right side of her body, in particular, on her right leg. An extract of the plaintiff’s medical report is reproduced below:
“According to our records, [the plaintiff] was admitted on 1/8/11 after a road traffic accident where she sustained a right knee laceration with extension into the knee joint, a right thigh laceration, right 2
nd
 toe distal phalanx amputation, right metatarsal shaft fracture and right 5
th
 metacarpal fracture.”
[note: xxvi]
The objective evidence did not support the defendant’s version
26     At trial, the defendant’s description of the accident was akin to a “head-on” collision in which he moved very slowly forward and only for a short distance of 2 – 3 m:
[note: xxvii]
Ct:
No car turning right from the opposite direction?
A:
That one I cannot recall. And I checked that the lights were red against them. And then the green arrow appeared. Before I made the right turn, I actually checked that there was no on-coming vehicle coming from the opposite direction. And I observed that it was safe to make a right turn. And 
I slowly moved my car forward
 and suddenly, a motorcycle dashed from behind the stationary cars from the opposite direction and it went between the cars in the first and second lanes and entered the cross road at a high speed. And then it crashed to the front right side of my car. The impact was so strong that the motorcyclist and pillion rider was thrown off the motorcycle. The pillion was thrown further away towards the island of the traffic lamp post. And the motorcyclist was just thrown to the side along Upper East Road.
…
Q:
So Mr Chia, when you accelerated to make your right turn – what speed were you going?
A:
 
Very slowly, just moved slightly forward.
 I can’t say how fast. Not sure about the number. Barely moved a short distance. About 2 – 3 metres. [Emphasis added]
27     First, the defendant’s account was inconsistent with the damage pattern inflicted on the Motorcycle (i.e. the damage to its right side) as well as the plaintiff’s injuries on her right leg. Second, the plaintiff, in her written submissions, raised the contention that, if the defendant’s version is to be believed in that he moved very slowly forward whilst turning and it was the plaintiff’s Motorcycle which crashed full force head on into the Car’s front right bumper, the final position of the Motorcycle would have been in the near vicinity of the impact point, i.e. within the path of travel in between lanes 1 and 2 and within the Junction.
[note: xxviii]
 I agreed with the plaintiff’s submission. From the coloured photographs of the accident scene and the Traffic Police sketch plan, the Motorcycle was situated post-accident near the right turning pocket along Upper East Coast Road towards Bedok Road which was some two lanes to the left of the plaintiff’s intended path of travel.
[note: xxix]
 Indeed, one of the coloured photographs actually show that the distance between the edge of lane 1 (the right-most lane) to the final position of the Motorcycle was approximately one car length.
[note: xxx]
 The aforesaid distance does not include the width of lane 1. I should also add that although the exact position where the plaintiff landed was not established in the course of trial, the defendant testified that the plaintiff was “just thrown to the side along Upper East Coast Road”.
[note: xxxi]
28     Although the photographs of the accident site
[note: xxxii]
 show a concentration of debris along lane 1 in the Junction, this does not weaken the inference that the collision occurred while the Motorcycle was in its intended path of travel along lane 2. After the accident, the traffic in the Junction along Bedok South Avenue 1 (i.e. in the same direction as the plaintiff) continued to move ahead despite the accident. The same photographs show vehicles proceeding across the Junction from lanes 1 and 2.
[note: xxxiii]
 These photographs were taken sometime after the accident. Any debris caused by the collision with the Car would undoubtedly have been disturbed by the incessant moving traffic. What debris that remained on the road after a while would have little probative value in determining the spot at which the plaintiff’s Motorcycle collided with the Car.
29     In the defendant’s Written Submissions
[note: xxxiv]
, the defendant argued that the fact that Danny was catapulted and landed at the island of the traffic lamp post proved that the plaintiff had rode at an excessive speed. In my view, this contention is at best speculative as there was no conclusive evidence to prove that the plaintiff was speeding at the material time. Further, I could not discount the possibility that Danny was in any event catapulted due to the impact of the collision whilst the plaintiff was riding at a speed of around 40km/h (in line with the plaintiff’s account). Hence, without the benefit of further/expert evidence, the Court should be slow to make such a finding as suggested by the defendant.
30     In any event, if the defendant’s version was correct, then Danny ought to, upon the head-on collision, have been catapulted straight along the path of travel (in between lanes 1 and 2) and ought not have landed at the island of the traffic lamp post which is to the left of the plaintiff’s intended path of travel.
The defendant’s version was improbable
31     To summarise, the defendant asserted that he slowly moved the Car forward when the green filter arrow of the traffic lights lit up in his favour and it was then that the plaintiff’s Motorcycle dashed from behind the stationary cars that stopped at the stop line from the opposite direction (i.e. the Motorcycle went in between the cars in lanes 1 and 2, i.e. the centre lane and right most lane respectively from the defendant’s perspective) at a speed of at least 70km/h. He stated that the Motorcycle thereafter entered the Junction and crashed into the front right side of the Car.
32     I should add that Li’s account in this regard was similar to the defendant’s save that she even added that “Definitely there were cars at the back of the front two cars at the stop line”
[note: xxxv]
. Hence, according to Li, the plaintiff actually squeezed in between 
two rows
 of stationary vehicles at 70km/h.
33     The space in between two cars in adjacent lanes would typically be narrow. This is illustrated in a coloured photograph tendered by the plaintiff (in the Plaintiff’s Supplementary Bundle of Documents Photographs at p 4) which shows random traffic stopping before the stop line at the Junction from the defendant’s perspective. The said photograph is particularly useful as it shows two cars at lanes 1 and 2 and a motorcycle behind them in between those two lanes. Given that the space in between two adjacent cars would be a narrow gap, motorcyclists would tend to go slowly in between two adjacent cars to avoid any mishap such as colliding into either car’s side or side view mirror. Squeezing through such a narrow gap (in between not one but two rows of cars) at a high speed of 70kmp/h would, in my view, be an extremely risky and difficult manoeuvre.
34     Moreover, the plaintiff was not riding a powerful motorcycle – the Motorcycle had an engine capacity of only 135cc. Bearing in mind that it was carrying both the plaintiff and Danny at the material time, it was unlikely that the plaintiff could have travelled at the high speed of 70kmp/h, overtaking and squeezing in between two rows of stationary cars.
35     In light of the above, I found the version given by the defendant and Li improbable and not believable.
Further observations on the evidence
36     I set out below my observations on 
inter alia
 the evidence given by the witnesses.
37     First, the plaintiff was a clear and calm witness. She did not contradict herself and was able to give a consistent and coherent account of what had happened. She responded to counsel’s questions without vacillation and did not attempt to finesse her answers. From what I have observed at trial, the plaintiff did not strike me as a reckless or careless rider. On the contrary, she seemed to me to be a rider who would not take any unnecessary risks on the road. Accordingly, I found the plaintiff to be a credible witness.
38     Second, I move on to the evidence given by the defendant. Counsel for the plaintiff did try to seize on some of the defendant’s answers during cross-examination such as the defendant only making his police report two days after the accident and his failure to mention the “green arrow” in pleadings filed in the separate proceedings DC 3892/2013 and in his affidavit.
[note: xxxvi]
 According to the defendant, he made his report two days after the accident because he was given a summons by the police to attend at the station. When questioned as to why he did not produce the summons as evidence, he stated that it did not cross his mind that it was an important document for the present case.
[note: xxxvii]
 In this regard, I gave the defendant the benefit of the doubt. I was also prepared to overlook his failure to mention the “green arrow” in certain pleadings and in his affidavit because the defendant did specifically mention the “green arrow” in his police report, which was a relatively contemporaneous document made two days after the accident. Further, it was specifically pleaded in the Defence that the plaintiff had crossed the stop line when the traffic lights were “red” against her.
[note: xxxviii]
 I accepted the defendant’s explanation during cross-examination for the omission of the words “green arrow” in his affidavit – he explained that his affidavit specifically mentioned that vehicles from the opposite direction had stopped at the stop line and that the traffic light was green for traffic turning right towards Upper East Coast Road. He stated that this was the only sequence possible.
[note: xxxix]
39     However, some of the defendant’s answers during cross-examination were telling and I reproduce the material parts below:
[note: xl]
Q:
PSBD-40 to 42: do you see the damage on your car? Are you telling us that kind of damage can be caused by a motorbike travelling at 30 – 40 kmph (this speed is according to the Pf and her witness) passing through a junction?
A:
When they said that there were travelling at 40 kmph, I disagree. Their speed must be much more than that. The reason I say this is because before I made the right turn, I checked that there were no on-coming vehicles but when I started to move just a short distance, the motorcycle appeared within a short period of time from behind the cars. The speed must be at least 70 kmph and came from behind and crashed into my car. I did not have time to react as it was so fast. 
If I may add, last night I surfed on youtube for accidents similar to ours, the damage is exactly what you see on my car if the motorcycle travelled at 70kmph or it could be even worse. That’s the reason I say it must be at least 70 kmph.
…
Q:
So Mr Chia, the Pf was already half-way across the road?
A:
 
That could also mean … its not significant. It can still be red light and they can still dash across. I read of an accident. Whereby the taxi hit the car in the middle of a junction
 …
Ct:
Mr Chia, you are called here today to be a factual witness. Please refrain from talking about your opinions. I let the youtube ramark [
sic
] pass by just now but please bear this in mind for future questions. Thank you.
[Emphasis added]
From the defendant’s answers at trial as highlighted above, it appeared to me that the defendant was over-compensating for something.
40     I also found it inconceivable that when questioned whether the defendant had discussed the accident with anyone prior to making his police report, he answered that he did not. I did not believe the defendant. Surely, he would have discussed it with Li who was with him during the accident. Even more so, he must have discussed it with Li’s mother who was the owner of the Car and who was the one who had failed to extend the third-party insurance coverage. Indeed, Li’s evidence, discussed below, shows that the defendant was not entirely truthful in this regard.
41     Third, I shall now consider the evidence given by Danny and Li. In assessing their evidence, I was mindful of the marital relationships between the plaintiff and Danny as well as that between the defendant and Li at the time of trial. Each couple are husband and wife and each couple have a common interest in the outcome of the present case. The evidence given by Danny and Li were generally consistent with the evidence given by their respective spouses. Moving forward, I had to decide which couple’s version ought to be preferred.
42     Counsel for the defendant argued that Danny completely lacked credibility due to his answers when posed questions regarding why he chose to sue the plaintiff only in DC 3892/2013 and his purportedly different position taken in that suit. In response to that line of questioning, Danny repeatedly stated that his lawyer had advised him to do so and that Counsel should ask his lawyer why this position was taken.
[note: xli]
 I accepted Danny’s explanation in this regard that his lawyer in the separate suit had advised him to take this course of action because the plaintiff (his wife) had insurance whilst the defendant did not have insurance coverage at the material time of the accident. The motivation behind such advice could very well be a strategic one after a consideration of the unique circumstances in the present case. Further, in such motor accident claims, it is quite common for the pillion to sue the rider first and for the insurers of the rider to initiate negotiations with the insurers of the driver of the other vehicle involved in the accident with a view to obtaining a contribution. If such negotiations fail, the insurers for the rider would eventually make the decision to commence third party proceedings against the said driver. As the insurers for the defendant was not involved in the present case, it was not surprising that the defendant was subsequently joined as a Third Party in DC 3892/2013.
43     I should stress that I am neither evaluating the merits of the advice given to Danny nor am I stating that I approved the course of action taken by Danny in DC 3892/2013. I am merely stating that based on his answers and from what I observed at trial, I believed Danny when he explained that he was advised by his lawyer to commence an action against the plaintiff in DC 3892/2013. In general, I found Danny to be a truthful witness. On the one occasion when Danny demonstrated his anger and a loss of control
[note: xlii]
, this was understandable given the ordeal that both the plaintiff and Danny had gone through.
44     I move on to my analysis of Li’s evidence. There were inconsistencies between Li’s evidence and that of the defendant. The defendant stated that the distance the Car moved before the impact was 2 – 3 m.
[note: xliii]
 At trial, Li testified that the said distance was 1 – 1.5 m only.
[note: xliv]
 I was prepared to overlook this minor inconsistency due to the small difference in estimations. There were however further discrepancies in Li’s evidence that I could not ignore. When questioned about the eye witness who had called the ambulance, the defendant answered that an architect did give him a name card but the architect’s wife took the name card back. Li however stated during cross-examination that the couple never spoke to the defendant.
[note: xlv]
 Li had one inconsistency within her own answers when she was asked whether she or the defendant had discussed the case with anyone else between the date of the accident (31 July 2011) and the day the defendant made the police report (2 August 2011). Li initially answered a definitive “not at all” but when I asked whether they discussed the accident with her mother, Li admitted that her “family was aware of the accident but it was not something which was pleasant to talk about”.
[note: xlvi]
45     In light of the foregoing, I found the evidence of the plaintiff and Danny to be more credible than that presented by the defendant and Li. I therefore preferred the plaintiff’s version of the accident over that given by the defendant.
46     After considering all the evidence in totality, I found, on a balance of probabilities, that the traffic lights were showing green in the plaintiff’s favour when she proceeded to ride into the Junction.
47     For completeness, I should add that the fact that there was no police action initiated against either the plaintiff or the defendant was, at best, a neutral point given the higher standard of proof required in criminal proceedings.
No contributory negligence on the plaintiff’s part
48     I accepted the plaintiff’s testimony on the witness stand that prior to entering the Junction, there was a car in front of the Motorcycle about one car length ahead. As she entered the Junction, she did notice the defendant’s Car waiting at the turning pocket from the opposite direction. The plaintiff nevertheless proceeded straight.
[note: xlvii]
 As she was half-way through the Junction, the Car made a sudden right turn into Upper East Coast Road in the direction of East Coast Road, and collided into the Motorcycle. It was more likely than not that the defendant made the sudden right turn immediately after the car in front of the plaintiff had passed the defendant’s Car and the defendant picked up speed and travelled faster than he would admit.
49     I therefore found that the plaintiff had no time to take any evasive measures and that she had not been negligent in maintaining her course despite being aware of the presence of the defendant’s Car in the turning pocket from the opposite direction.
Judgment
50     For the reasons given above, I found the defendant wholly liable for the accident and there will therefore be judgment for the plaintiff with damages to be assessed, with costs and interest reserved to the assessing Registrar.
