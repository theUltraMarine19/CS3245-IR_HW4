The plaintiffs, United Overseas Bank Limited (the Bank), in applying for the declarations in the amended originating summons, are in effect seeking orders for the rescission of the transactions effected by the parties in August 1985 and a return to the position between them prior to these transactions having been effected on the basis of restitutio in integrum.
Only the first defendants contested the Bank's application. The second, third and fourth defendants did not enter appearance. However, at the time of the hearing, as the second defendants had been wound up and the fourth defendant was already a bankrupt, Miss Yap Siew Yong, appeared for them both to say that they were not contesting these proceedings for lack of funds. She said that the Official Receiver for the second defendants and the Official Assignee for the fourth defendants would be bound by the findings of facts in these proceedings and, on the basis that the plaintiffs prove their claim, orders for declaration would have to be made against the second and fourth defendants. Mr Hamilton QC for the Bank indicated that no relief was sought against the third defendants.
The facts on which the Bank make their claim are to be found in the affidavit of Vivien Chan filed on 9 October 1986. I have somewhat expanded on them as follows.
In August 1980 the Bank granted credit facilities for up to $2m to the first defendants, Malaysia Electric (Geylang) Co Pte Ltd (In Liquidation)(ME). In February 1984, these facilities were increased by a further $1.6m. In total an aggregate of $3.6m in credit facilities was made available to ME. These facilities were secured, inter alia, by:
(a) a first legal mortgage executed by the fourth defendant, Sim Lek Tee (Sim) on 30 August 1980 of his one-half share in Unit B6, People's Park Centre (the Unit); and (b) a second legal mortgage executed by the Sim on 14 February 1984 of his one-half share in the Unit.
Now, I must give some background facts on Sim and his three defendant companies. At the time of the hearing he was 53 years of age and an undischarged bankrupt. At all material times, Sim was a shareholder and director of the three defendant companies. It was said on his behalf by his counsel, Mr Fong, that he was the controlling will and mind of these companies. Indeed, when he gave evidence he said that the first, second and third defendants belonged to him.
In 1963 he started selling electrical goods in a partnership. In October 1979, ME was incorporated to take over the business with a paid-up capital of $2m. There were three shareholders, his wife, Tay Ah Moi, his brother, Sim Tee Tee, and himself. He was the managing director. In 1982 the turnover was about $60m a year; in 1984 the electrical business was bad, the company had difficulties in cash flow; by 1985, the company was unable to pay its debts.
In January 1981, Sim registered the second defendants, People's Park Centre Gold and Jewellers Pte Ltd (PPC) with a paid-up capital of $1m to carry on retail business in gold jewellery. This company had the same three shareholders as ME except that Sim's wife was the managing director and he the chairman. The business was good in 1982 and 1983, but in 1984 and 1985 as the times were bad the company failed to make any profit. In March 1985, Far Eastern Bank Ltd entered a default judgment against PPC for over $1.4m and in August 1985 against Sim as guarantor. PPC was wound up in September 1987 on a petition of Asia Commercial Bank as the company was unable to pay the bank's interests.
Sim formed the third defendants, Sin Cheong Pte Ltd (Sin Cheong) in 1976 with a paid-up capital of $200,002. The shareholders were the same three, his wife, his brother and himself. The company was in the investment business. The only asset the company had was the other one-half share in the Unit.
Reverting back to ME, as I have already said, by early 1985 ME was in financial difficulties. On 29 March 1985 Philips Singapore Pte Ltd (Philips), one of ME's suppliers, sued ME and Sim as guarantor for $535,000 and interest. On 13 April 1985 Philips obtained judgment against ME for the claim and against Sim on 5 of July 1985. On 21 May 1985 Philips presented a winding-up petition against ME which was on 19 June 1985 advertised in the Straits Times, and the Chinese newspaper, Lian He Zao Bao; and it was also advertised on 12 July 1985 in the Government Gazette. On 16 August 1985 an order was made for the compulsory winding up of ME.
Earlier, on 18 June 1985 Philips obtained a Mareva injunction against Sim restraining him from disposing of or dealing with his property. Philips also registered a caveat against Sim's one-half share in the Unit on 7 August 1985 in the Registry of Titles.
In the meantime, sometime in April 1985, the Bank agreed to extend banking facilities to PPC for the purpose of settling ME's loan with the Bank. It was also further agreed that PPC could re-draw on the banking facilities for its trading purposes after PPC had made payment to its account. This loan transaction was finalised by the Letter of Facility dated 23 May 1985, under which the Bank gave PPC credit facilities totalling $3.5m. These facilities were secured, inter alia, by:
(a) a first legal mortgage by Sim of his one- half share in the Unit; and (b) a second legal mortgage by Sin Cheong of the other half-share of the Unit (ranking after the existing first legal mortgage securing Sin Cheong's own account with the Bank). Sim executed the new mortgages in the office of the Bank's solicitors, Shook Lin & Bok.
On or about 14 and 15 August, Shook Lin & Bok, delivered to the Registry of Titles the following documents for provisional registration: (a) Total Discharge of Mortgage in respect of the original mortgages executed by Sim on 30 August 1980 and 14 February 1984 respectively; and (b) the new Mortgages given as securities for the line of credit granted to PPC.
On 21 August 1985 Sim, as the authorised signatory of PPC, drew three cheques totalling $3,534,502.02 on the credit facilities given to PPC in favour of ME. The cheques were handed over to Wong Kim Choong, the Credit Officer with whom Sim dealt with in the Bank and the three sums were credited into ME's account in settlement of ME's outstanding indebtedness.
On 30 of August 1985, Shook Lin & Bok was informed by the Registry of Titles that the documents lodged earlier could not be registered as there was a subsisting caveat by Philips. The solicitors then conducted searches at the Registry of Titles and the Registry of the Supreme Court and discovered, inter alia, the existence of the Mareva injunction against Sim, the order for the winding up of ME, and the caveat of Philips against Sim's one-half share in the Unit.
Pursuant to leave granted by the High Court, on 4 September 1986, the Bank then commenced these proceedings against the four defendants and sought the following declarations: (1) a declaration that the mortgage dated 30 August 1980 and the further mortgage dated 14 February 1984 both made between the Bank (mortgagee) and Sim (mortgagor) and registered as No I/67344B and No I/67828C are valid, subsisting and enforceable against Sim; (2) a declaration that the banking facilities more particularly described in the Bank's letter dated 23 May 1985 were offered and released to the PPC under a fundamental mistake of fact or alternatively pursuant to misrepresentation on the part of Sim and ought to be set aside; (3) a declaration that Sim had wrongfully drawn cheques No 666157, 666158 and 666159 (""the said cheques"") totalling S$3,534,502.02 on behalf of PPC on the Bank in breach of his fiduciary powers as a director of PPC and that the said cheques are null and void accordingly and ought to be cancelled; and (4) a declaration that Sim had wrongfully received the said cheques on behalf of ME, had wrongfully presented the said cheques to the Bank for crediting into the account of the ME with the Bank and that the consequential crediting by the Bank of the sum of S$3,534,502.02 representing the aggregate amount of the said cheques into the account of ME with the Bank was made under a fundamental mistake of fact or alternatively pursuant to misrepresentation on the part of Sim, of no effect and ought to be set aside.
Next, Sim filed an affidavit on 19 November 1986 in response to the affidavit of Vivien Chan. He accepted the material facts in Vivien Chan's affidavit. He said that he always dealt with the Wong Kim Choong (Wong) in the Bank who, according to him, was very familiar with the business carried on and the financial standings of the three defendant companies.
Sim said in his affidavit that in early 1985 he informed the Bank that ME's business was very bad and that ME was in financial difficulties. Because there were several outstanding trade creditors to whom ME owed monies exceeding $3m, ME was unable to pay up the outstanding due to the Bank. Save for Philips, the other major creditors decided not to sue ME and allowed ME to carry on their business in the expectation that things would improve with time.
In March 1985, Philips took court action against ME and Sim. Sim affirmed that it was Wong who had informed him that the Bank knew that Philips had instituted legal proceedings against ME and him. Sim's version of the loan facility by the Bank to PPC was that because of ME's financial difficulties, it was Wong who had ""proposed and devised a new scheme of financial arrangements and I went along with his proposals"". He confirmed the Letter of Facility of 23 May 1985. He maintained that PPC was represented by Shook Lin & Bok and not by their own solicitors, Ng Wong & Chung, at the Bank's behest because ""the Bank was anxious to expedite the completion of the legal documents"". As to what happened thereafter between him and the Bank, he said:
""8. On 21 August, 1985 I was asked by Mr Wong to be at the main branch office of the Plaintiffs. I was to bring three (3) blank cheques belonging to the 2nd Defendants' account with the Plaintiffs. At first, Mr Wong asked me to draw the three cheques (exh ""VC4"" in the affidavit of Ms Vivien Chan) in favour of ""UOB"" (the Plaintiffs) as payees but subsequently he instructed me to delete ""UOB"" and write the name of the 1st Defendants instead. I initialled the deletion and wrote the amounts in figures. I also wrote the date in the 3 cheques and signed the three cheques. The amount in words were written and typed by one of the staff of the Plaintiffs. I do not know why I was asked by Mr Wong to make out the three cheques in the three different amounts. I did not question Mr Wong and merely did what I was told to do.""
Much of the matters in the remaining paras of Sim's affidavit refer not to facts, but arguments prepared by his legal advisers; notwithstanding that I would refer to the text in para 11 to show Sim's stand in these proceedings.
""11. I am now convinced that the Plaintiffs have used the Defendants to suit their own ends. They knew that the 1st Defendants would collapse. The banking facilities of S$3,534,502.02 granted to the 1st Defendants were secured mainly by the first and second legal mortgages of my undivided one half share of Unit B6, ... The Plaintiffs had no other security of value to cover their exposure to the imminent loss of S$3,534,502.02. In contrast thereto the banking facilities granted to the 2nd Defendants, a profitable going concern then, were far better secured by the several valuable securities emunerated in pages 4 and 5 of the Plaintiffs' letter of 23 May 1985 ... The Plaintiffs also felt that the 2nd Defendants were better placed to meet the interest payments on the facility. It is therefore hardly surprising that the Plaintiffs were in a great rush and hurry when they instructed their solicitors, Ms Shook Lin & Bok that ""This matter is urgent and we are working towards having the documents signed within 2 weeks"" ... ""
The third and only other affidavit in these proceedings was filed by Wong for the Bank. It was a response to Sim's affidavit. Wong said that whilst he was familiar with ME's and PPC's accounts with the Bank, he did not know of the actual financial standing of ME and PPC as up-to-date financial statements of these two companies were not made available to the Bank. He knew that ME were facing cash flow problems but not the extent of their total indebtedness. Sim had informed him that ME's collection of trade debts in the electrical business was slow and that he was going to concentrate on his gold and jewellery business. That was why Sim wanted the Bank to grant facilities to PPC and the Bank had agreed to transfer the line of credit from ME to PPC. He said that market feedback had been that suppliers to ME might be pressing ahead with legal proceedings but he had no knowledge of Philips' action against ME or Sim. He did not inform Sim that the Bank knew of Philips' action.
Wong did ask Sim to be at the Bank's main office to settle ME's account. The amounts in the three cheques were the outstanding sums owing by ME. He wanted the name of the Bank on the cheques deleted and ME's name substituted because the payee's name should be ME as the cheques were to be credited to the three outstanding accounts of ME. He did not know at that time of any winding-up proceedings against ME or that ME and Sim were insolvent. He had no knowledge that ME would collapse.
The Bank did not have an exposure to the imminent loss of $3,534,502.02 as they had, in addition to the mortgages, guarantees and shares as securities for the outstanding. The urgency indicated by the Bank to their solicitors was due to the fact that Sim required the line of credit to be transferred to PPC as soon as possible. On legal representation, Wong said that the Bank was informed by Sim that his solicitors were Ng Wong & Chung. However, when Shook Lin & Bok wrote to them, the reply was that they did not receive any instructions to act for PPC. Wong said that if the Bank had known that ME was insolvent, they would not have agreed to Sim's request.
The three deponents of the affidavits gave oral evidence at the hearing. The first was Vivien Chan. She has been with the Bank since 1981 and was at the time of hearing the Head of the Legal Department and the Secretary of the Bank. She did not have any direct dealings with any of the defendant companies. She met Sim only once, either in July or August 1985, soon after the Bank was informed that the new mortgages could not be registered.
She did not know of the proceedings by Philips against ME and Sim. She became aware of them only after Shook Lin & Bok had made the searches and informed her about them. She was horrified when she learnt from Shook Lin & Bok about the affairs of ME. She said if she had known earlier she would not have allowed the loan transactions which created the new mortgages to go through.
She also did not know that Far Eastern Bank had obtained a default judgment against PPC in March 1985 and against Sim as guarantor in August 1985 for over $1.4m. She knew of them only the week before the hearing when she was shown the bundle of cause papers.
When shown the Statement of Affairs of ME (P1), she said that the Bank has not submitted a proof of debt for their claim; nor has the Official Receiver requested the Bank to submit a proof. The figure of just over $2.8m in Schedule G, the List of Unsecured Creditors in P1, was not a correct figure. She had no idea of how this figure came to be put there. She was also shown the Statement of Affairs of PPC (P2). The Bank has also not submitted a proof of debt. She was not aware of how the figure of $15,868.09 in this Schedule G was arrived at. The amount outstanding from PPC to the Bank was a much larger amount. She was also shown the Statement of Affairs (P3) of Sim in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said the Bank had not lent Sim personally any money which was outstanding whereas List C shows the Bank as creditor in the sum of $2m.
In cross-examination, she said that the facts contained in her affidavit and of which she gave evidence were all information and instructions that were given to her by the Credit Department of the Bank, in particular she got them from Wong. To a question from Mr Fong, she said that it was not for her to satisfy herself that PPC have the powers to borrow. She left that to the Bank's solicitors. It was not strange to her that PPC would borrow to settle the debt of ME. She was taken through the Letter of Facility dated 23 of May 1985. She explained how the loan given to PPC would be used by them to discharge the liability of ME to the Bank. Nothing turns on these matters.
On another topic, she said that it was part of her duties to obtain information for the Bank about legal proceedings brought against customers of the Bank. She was unaware of the Cause Book in the Registry of the Supreme Court or of another cause book in the subordinate courts. But she knew of organisations that supply information on civil proceedings initiated in Singapore commonly known as credit information organisations. She believed these organisations supply weekly or bi-weekly lists to their customers. The Bank is now customer of such an organisation, but she did not know whether in 1985 the Bank was. Yet, on another topic she said that the Bank did not tell Shook Lin & Bok to act for Sim and PPC. In fact, she had told the solicitors that it was Ng Wong & Chung who were solicitors for Sim and PPC.
The next witness, Wong, confirmed the contents of his affidavit. He said that in the Credit Department one does get market feedback from colleagues on matters regarding the Bank's customers. He denied that he informed Sim that the Bank knew of Philips' actions. He said that if he had known of the steps taken by Philips in the courts, he would have reported them to his superiors and taken legal advice from the Legal Department. He only became aware after his Legal Department told him that the mortgages could not be completed.
He said that Sim had told him that the electrical business was slow and collections were poor, and that his gold business was doing well. Therefore, Sim wanted the facilities ME had with the Bank to be transferred to PPC and ME's accounts with the Bank were to be paid up. This was to be effected by implementing the $3.5m credit line to PPC. PPC then drew three cheques totalling about $3.5m to ME's account to pay off its debts. Wong was of the view that the payee's name on the three cheques should be ME since ME was to pay off its debts owing to the Bank. He said that the amounts in the three cheques exactly paid off all the outstanding accounts of ME with the Bank.
Wong did not think that Sim was a stupid man. He was an experienced businessman. He was asked to come to the Bank to clear ME's debts. He knew that the three amounts in the three cheques were for the three different types of facilities enjoyed by ME. Sim also knew that the monies drawn on the three cheques were to be used only to pay off the debts of ME. They were not to become the general monies of ME.
Wong confirmed that he did inform the Legal Department that Ng Wong & Chung would act for Sim and PPC in the legal mortgage. He couldn't recall but believed Sim told him of this. As far as he could recall, it was Sim who wanted to complete as soon as possible. He did not ask why.
In cross-examination, Wong was asked about his experience as a credit officer in 1985 (he had joined the Bank in 1983), and the steps he had taken to recommend to the Bank to give the loan to PPC. He was questioned at length on the Credit Report he had made at that time. He was satisfied that there was sufficient security for the loan.
At that time he did not know that ME was trading in physical gold or that PPC was trading in the gold market. He knew, however, that Sim was utilising the gold facility referred to as the BPG line which ME and PPC had with the Bank but he did not know the purpose. He presumed it was in the course of their business. He was not concerned.
Considerable time and effort was spent on the topic whether the loan ME had was a problem loan. Wong maintained that ME's account with the Bank was not a problem account. It was not a ""classified"" account, that is to say, it did not fall under one of the four categories set out by MAS. He, however, readily agreed with Mr Fong that if it meant that in 1985 overdue bills of ME were not repaid it was in that sense a problem account. Wong was shown the Statement of Account of the Overdraft Facility (D2) of ME with the Bank. At the material time, in these accounts there were lots of small credits and debits. He did not consider this to be a problem account but he did call Sim to cover this overdraft. Even as regards the gold credit line on which there were overdue bills, he used to press Sim to pay up. That was why Sim came to the Bank in April 1985 for a transfer of the loan from ME to PPC. The Bank had agreed because it expected Sim's companies to turn around. Besides calling up Sim, Wong brought ME's accounts to the notice of his bosses. In any event, as Mr Fong reminded him, Wong agreed 1985 was a bad year, a lot of companies were facing difficulties. His bosses, too, asked him to call Sim to pay up.
Finally, it was put to Wong that the whole transaction was designed by Wong and others in the Bank to recover as much as they could from a bad facility. He denied it. He reiterated that it was Sim who made the request for the transfer. On the facility letter dated 23 of May 1985, it was put to him that the true purpose was not stated in the letter because the Bank wanted to conceal that fact. He said that it was not true.
The last witness was Sim. He was now a salesman in a jewellery shop. In cross-examination, it was obtained from him that he was working for People's Park Jewellers Pte Ltd which was carrying on business in that part of the Unit where PPC had carried on a similar business. His two daughters were the directors of this company. He claimed that he had no say in the running of this business.
Of his personal assets in 1985, he had (a) a property in Nassim Road which he bought as vacant land in 1980/81 for $1.1m and had a bungalow built on it for which he spent more that $1m; (b) a building known as Lai Lai Complex at No 42 East Coast Road of which he was half owner, a shopping complex of about 20,000 square feet valued then at $10m, financed by Malayan Banking to the tune of $7m; (c) a bungalow house at No 1 King's Walk, his residence, then valued at $1.8m pledged to Asia Commercial Bank for $1.2m; (d) the Unit, B6 in People's Park Complex; and (e) shares in companies.
He confirmed that he only dealt with Wong in the Bank. As he put it, there was no need to inform others in the Bank. He confirmed para 5 of his affidavit that in April 1985 when he went to the Bank Wong told him that Philips had taken action against him, Mr Fong asked him:
"" Q. Why did he tell you this? How did it come about? A. He must tell me. He was the officer taking charge of the account. Q. Why did you go to the Bank on that occasion? A. I used to go to the Bank, once or twice a week to bank in money. ""
On the minute of a Board meeting of PPC dated 22 July 1985 signed by him approving the arrangements for the $3.5m credit facilities given by the Bank to PPC, Sim confirmed that the resolution had his signature. He said that he was the only person present in the making of the resolution. Then Sim made the astonishing allegation that the resolution was prepared by the Bank and that Wong handed it to him. Needless to say, Wong was not questioned on it nor was it put to him. When Sim was cross-examined on it, he said that he did consult his wife and younger brother, the other directors of PPC on this board resolution.
In cross-examination, Sim was questioned on the contents of three documents which Mr Hamilton had put in when he opened the case for the Bank. They were (a) the Statement of Affairs of ME (P1), affirmed to by Sim's brother, Sim Tee Tee; (b) the Statement of Affairs of PPC (P2), affirmed to by Sim's daughter, Sim Chay Hiang; and (c) Sim's own Statement of Affairs (P3) affirmed by him after the receiving order and adjudication order were made against him.
On P1 he said he did discuss it with Sim Tee Tee and that the Statement was correct. But when he was taken through P1, he admitted, as he put it, that there were ""mistakes"". Some instances would suffice: I take Schedule B, the List of Sundry Debtors in P1: (i) PPC, formerly known as Chevelina Pte Ltd, shown as ""company closed down"" was wrong; (ii) Sin Cheong, described as ""company is insolvent"" was also wrong; (iii) Sim shown as a debtor to ME in the sum of $14.8m, out of the total debt of ME of $18.8m was simply not true; (iv) SLT Pte Ltd, a property investment company, the shareholders of which were Sim, his wife and brothers, shown as a debtor to ME for over $1m and described as ""insolvent"" were also false.
Sim was then referred to Schedule G, the List of Unsecured Creditors in P1 and asked to explain how the Bank was shown as a creditor for $2.8m when after 21 of August 1985, ME drew no further monies from the Bank. He said that it arose from the current account, but there was no such account. He was also asked to explain why PPC were not shown as creditors of ME. He did not give a direct answer but kept saying that PPC were not creditors of ME.
He was then referred to the Statement of Affairs of PPC, P2. In Schedule B the only sundry debtor of PPC was himself for over $3.7m. He said that PPC's only asset was the debt owed by him. He was then shown his own Statement of Affairs, P3, which he had affirmed.
"" Q. You have for the last half an hour said that you were a debtor to first defendants for $14.8m and to the second defendants for $3.7m. Why are those two companies not shown as creditors in your personal bankruptcy? A. I was thinking that the amount of money that I owe to these two companies was as a result of what I made use of my things to mortgage. Court: Q. (Question reput.) A. Because I did not know I have to state that amounts I owed to my own companies. Q. Once those companies had gone into liquidation, you knew perfectly well that you must repay to those companies the monies you had taken for the benefit of the creditors of those companies? A. Yes. I knew that the monies I took had to be paid back. Q. Yet you did not choose to show them in your statement of affairs? A. It is my mistake. ""
In the course of his cross-examination, Sim admitted that in April 1985 he did discuss with Wong on his accounts with the Bank. He did tell Wong at a meeting that his electrical business was not doing well and that he wanted to concentrate on his gold business. On the topic of legal representation, he did tell the Bank that his solicitors, Ng Wong & Chung, would act for PPC for the new facilities. Later, it was he, and not the Bank, who asked Shook Lin & Bok to act for him. He said more than once that no one from the Bank asked him to go to Shook Lin & Bok. He went there on his own accord. He was pointedly asked whether the Bank had put any pressure on him to hurry things up. He said: ""No.""
When he went to Shook Lin & Bok he did not tell the solicitors about the winding-up proceedings against ME or of Philips' injunction against him. When it was put to him that he did not tell the solicitors because he knew that if he had told them, they would not allow him to go ahead with the transactions, he avoided the question by saying he knew nothing about the law. After he was pressed on the matter, he denied and said that that was not in his mind. When it was further put to him that the reason why he did not go to his own solicitors, Ng Wong & Chung, was because they too would not have allowed the transactions to go through, Sim was driven into a corner. He said: ""It was not I who did not want to go to Ng Wong & Chung; it was they < the Bank > who told me to go to Shook Lin & Bok.""
Finally, Sim was taken through paras 8, 9 and 11 of his affidavit. On para 8 quoted above, he now confessed that he knew exactly what he was doing when he signed the three cheques. He agreed that the purpose was to enable ME to pay off its indebtedness to the Bank; this would release his first mortgage on the Unit; that would allow a new mortgage on it to be executed so that PPC could have the use of the new facilities. He also agreed that ME could not have used these monies for any other purpose.
On para nine of his affidavit that the Bank knew and/or ought to have known that ME were subject to winding up proceedings, he admitted that he had not specifically told Wong of it. He now denied his statement in this para that at all material times the Bank knew that ME and he were insolvent. He agreed that he had only told Wong he was having financial difficulties, and had hoped to recover from them.
Still on para nine, he said he had had dealings with Wong over a period of time and had found him to be a truthful person. On the last sentence in this para that the Bank knew that legal proceedings have been commenced by Philips against ME and him, he said he did not tell Wong of this.
On para 11 of his affidavit quoted above, Sim said that he had only privately thought that the Bank ought to have known that ME would collapse but he did not tell Wong of it. He confirmed that the Bank had on top of the mortgages, other securities and guarantees. He confirmed that the Bank would not suffer a loss of $3.5m. He did not tell the Bank that there would be an ""imminent"" loss. Through a line of questions, Sim admitted that the statement in para 11 that PPC was a profitable going concern in the middle of 1985 was not true because in March 1985 Far Eastern Bank had obtained judgment for over $1.4m and by August 1985 PPC was insolvent.
After Sim had given evidence, ME closed its case. Mr Hamilton then made a full submission on the whole of the evidence. He concluded that the two witnesses for the Bank, Vivien Chan and Wong were good and honest witnesses, they were indeed truthful witnesses. On the other hand, the same could not be said of the witness for ME. Sim was not only a very evasive witness, he had also contradicted his affidavit evidence and his evidence-in-chief in very material matters. On the three Statements of Affairs, P1, P2, and P3, Sim and his co-directors had clearly affirmed to facts and figures which were patently false. Most important of all was that Sim finally confirmed the evidence given by Vivien Chan and Wong for the Bank.
For ME, Mr Fong tendered a written submission of 46 pages. In it there is a recital of the chronology of events, and some criticisms of Wong's evidence and even of Vivien Chan's evidence, but there is no analysis whatsoever of Sim's evidence. For myself, there was no doubt in my mind that Sim's evidence was crucial, for if his evidence of the events relating to the transactions was rejected, then on the other evidence before me the Bank must succeed on the grounds of misrepresentation and/or fundamental mistake of fact. So, I come to the findings of fact I made in this case.
It is in order to make clear the findings that I have in this judgment dealt extensively with the evidence given at the hearing. I must now say that I had no hesitation in accepting the evidence of Vivien Chan and Wong for the Bank on how the new facilities came to be given to PPC and of their knowledge of the affairs of ME, PPC and of Sim's business interests at the material time. On Sim's evidence I would observe that for one who had been a successful businessman he cut a poor figure in court. I would like to think that he had only himself to blame for the predicament he was in. At the end of his stay in the witness box he redeemed himself somewhat by accepting the Bank's version of the transactions. Let me summarise the essential findings of facts. (1) Neither Wong nor the Bank knew or were made aware of any of Philips' legal actions against ME and Sim. (2) Neither Wong nor the Bank had ""devised"" the new facilities for PPC; the proposal came from Sim and the Bank agreed to it.
(3) The purpose of the loan to PPC was to enable ME to clear its indebtedness to the Bank. (4) The argument of Mr Fong that because the facility letter of 23 May 1985 did not mention the above reason for the loan, the loan transaction was flawed cannot be sustained, for it was not supported by evidence. ME did not call any evidence that a letter of facility must state the reason for the loan. To my knowledge, such is not the case. (5) Sim went to Shook Lin & Bok on his own accord because Ng Wong and Chung would have declined to act for him for the new mortgages.
It was clear to me that this case had to be resolved on the facts. To use the words of Lawton LJ in Rolled Steel Products (Holdings) Ltd v British Steel Corporation and Others (1986) 1 Ch 246 at 307 (a case brought to my attention by Mr Fong in his written submission):
"" Stripped of its legal complications, many of which were caused by the way the trial judge dealt with the defendants' applications to amend the pleadings, this case raises issues of fact. When the evidence is looked at in the round, there is revealed an unattractive story of a fairly common kind which shows how some business men manipulate limited liability companies to avoid their financial liabilities and what other business men are driven to do in order to get paid what they are entitled to receive. ""
In the present case, whether there was misrepresentation and/or a fundamental mistake of fact were questions of fact. On these, I accepted the written submissions for the Bank.
The relevant facts on misrepresentation are these. Sim and PPC knew at the material times that ME was subject to winding up proceedings and Sim knew he was subject to the Mareva injunction. In purporting to discharge ME's indebtedness to the Bank, Sim had represented to the Bank that ME was still trading, was not in liquidation and could make a valid payment to the Bank to discharge its indebtedness. In executing the new mortgage Sim further represented to the Bank that there was no restriction on his dealing with his property. The Bank, on the other hand, was unaware of these facts. The Bank induced by these representations allowed PPC to draw on the new facilities given to them for the purpose of providing funds to ME to pay off ME's indebtedness to the Bank. In my view, these facts clearly engendered misrepresentations which entitled the Bank to rescind the transactions.
On the subject of fundamental mistake of fact, the Bank made a mistake that ME as a trading company not subject to winding up proceedings, let alone a winding up order, was in a position to pay off their indebtedness to the Bank. Another mistake was that the Bank acted on the assumption that Sim was able to grant to the Bank a new first legal mortgage on his one-half share in the Unit, which in fact was not the case as there was the caveat registered at the Registry of Titles by Philips. Moreover, Sim was in breach of the Mareva injunction. The Bank knew of none of these matters. The Bank would not have made the payments but for their mistaken assumptions. Because the Bank had, under the mistaken assumptions, allowed PPC to draw on their facilities, they were, in my view, entitled to rescind the transactions and the various payments made and the documents executed must be set aside.
It is helpful here that I refer to Solle v Butcher (1950) 1 KB 671 (another case from Mr Fong's written submission). In arriving at my decision I was guided by what Denning LJ (as he then was) said on the subject of mistakes and misrepresentations arising in contracts. In particular at page 692, he said:
"" Let me next consider mistakes which render a contract voidable, that is, liable to be set aside on some equitable ground. Whilst presupposing that a contract was good at law, or at any rate not void, the court of equity would often relieve a party from the consequences of his own mistake, so long as it could do so without injustice to third parties. The court, it was said had power to set aside the contract whenever it was of opinion that it was unconscientious for the other party to avail himself of the legal advantage which he had obtained: Torrance v Bolten (1876-8) 1 QBD 348 per James LJ.
The court had, of course, to define what it considered to be unconscientious, but in this respect equity has shown a progressive development. It is now clear that a contract will be set aside if the mistake of the one party has been induced by a material misrepresentation of the other, even though it was not fraudulent or fundamental; or if one party, knowing that the other is mistaken about the terms of an offer, or the identity of the person by whom it is made, lets him remain under his delusion and concludes a contract on the mistaken terms instead of pointing out the mistake.""
At the end of the day, the question I had to ask was: if the Bank had known the true facts, would the Bank have paid the money? The answer was surely ""No"". Accordingly, I made an order in term of paras one, two and four of the amended originating summons.",1992-06-26 00:00:00,SG High Court
