and

Queen (Defendant) Respondent.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Defences—Second degree
murder—Self defence and provocation—Excessive force—Party intoxicated—Whether
or not qualified defence of excessive force in self-defence available to reduce
charge—Whether or not trial judge’s charge as to qualified defence of
provocation adequate—Whether or not intoxication relevant to
self-defence—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34, ss. 34, 212(a).

The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld
appellant’s conviction of second degree murder for the fatal stabbing of his
paramour. Appellant, believing that she intended to kill him when she charged
at him with a knife, tried to stop her and killed her in the ensuing “tussle”.
Both were intoxicated. The following issues arose from the Court of Appeal’s
judgment: (1) whether or not the trial judge ought to direct the jury to a
verdict of manslaughter in circumstances where the accused acted in
self-defence but had used excessive force; (2) whether or not the trial judge’s
charge with respect to the qualified defence of provocation was adequate; and
(3) whether or not the trial judge ought to have instructed the jury to
consider the accused’s intoxication when they decided whether he had acted in
self-defence within the meaning of s. 34 of the Code.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The defence of self-defence fails on a
finding of excessive force; the trial judge therefore did not need to direct
the jury to a verdict of manslaughter in those circumstances. The trial judge’s
charge on the qualified defence of provocation was adequate for the jury could
not have been misled by the portion of the charge in question when it is read
in the context of the whole charge on provocation. The trial judge did not err
in his charge to the jury on self‑defence. The defence accorded an
accused by s. 34(1) is not available where the jury

[Page 397]

finds, as it did in this case, that the
accused intentionally used force to cause death. The accused may be found to
have acted in self-defence within the meaning of s. 34(2) even if he were
mistaken in his apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm or if he
mistakenly believed he could not preserve himself from death or grievous bodily
harm otherwise than by the force he used. His apprehension, however, must be
reasonable and his belief based on reasonable grounds. The relevance of
intoxication under s. 34(2) is eliminated and the defence is available to an
intoxicated person if the accused’s perception meets this objective standard.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court
of Appeal (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 146, dismissing an appeal from a conviction
for second degree murder. Appeal dismissed.

Bruce Durno, for the appellant.

John C. Pearson, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal, brought with leave
of this Court, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reasons
for judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Arnup on behalf of that Court, dismissing
the appeal of the accused from the verdict of a jury which had found him guilty
of second degree murder in the killing of the paramour with whom he had shared
an apartment in Toronto.

The facts of this case are not seriously in
dispute and the sordid circumstances which directly preceded the killing have
been so fully and accurately analyzed in the reasons for judgment of
Mr. Justice Arnup that, in my opinion, it is unnecessary to repeat them in
detail for the purposes of disposing of this appeal.

The appellant stands charged that he:

[Page 398]

…on or about the 13th day of May in the
year 1979 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District
of York murdered one Eileen Gertrude Fraser, and thereby committed second
degree murder, contrary to the Criminal Code .

There is no doubt, nor is it denied, that the
said Eileen Fraser came to her death as a result of three blows from a sharp
knife in the hands of the appellant. The events immediately preceding the
stabbing are best described in the appellant’s own evidence from which the
following excerpt is reproduced in the reasons for judgment of the Court of
Appeal ((1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 146, at pp. 150-51):

She was coming out here and she has got
this knife and this look you wouldn’t believe it, the look in her eyes, she was
coming at me and she was charging me fast.

Q. Was she saying anything?

A. Nothing. Not a word. Just coming at me.

Q. What did you do?

A. All I could see was this, the flash of
the knife, that look in her eyes, and tried to bang it away, and I just lashed
out, tried to hit her.

Q. Did you realize at the time you were
carrying anything or were you carrying anything?

A. I just, just wanted to stop her, that is
all. That knife. I just thought she was going to kill me… Just like this, she
turned again. For no reason. No reason. No rhyme or reason. I thought… I
thought and thought and thought what have I said? What have I done? What could
bring this on? And there I am. There she is.

Q. You said you lashed out at her. What do you
mean by that?

A. Just tried to get rid—tried to get the
knife away from me and hit her at the same time. I just—I just hit. I don’t
know, instinct, it is not too clear. Everything was so fast. Just tussling and
that was it then and there she was.

Q. Did you intend to kill her?

A. Certainly not. I loved that woman and…

On cross-examination:

Q. She came out. Was she screaming at you
as she came out the door?

[Page 399]

A. No, she wasn’t screaming—just charged
me—not a word, nothing.

Q. With this knife in her hand?

A. Just came at me.

Q. What was your first reaction?

A. I can’t very well say it here.

It is to be remembered that this incident was
the culmination of some days of verbal abuse between the parties conducted in
loud voices so that the neighbours overheard it and noted that it was largely
conducted by Eileen Fraser who, a short time before, had called out to the
appellant, for no apparent reason, saying: “You son of a bitch, you rotten
bastard”. This example of abuse was later cited by the appellant as a
provocative factor contributing to the state of mind which caused him to “lash
out” at the victim in what turned out to be the fatal assault which gave rise
to the present charge. I am satisfied, however, that there was a sufficient
lapse of time between this abuse and the stabbing so that the two cannot be
related and in any event, the crudity of the abusive insult appears to have
been consistent with the daily conversational exchange between the parties and
accordingly would not necessarily give rise to any violent reaction on the
appellant’s part.

The main defences advanced by the appellant were
provocation and self-defence and this is reflected in the following grounds of
appeal, pursuant to which leave to this Court was granted, which read as follows:

1. Did the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario err in law in holding
that the Learned Trial Judge was not required to direct the jury that if the
jury found that the Appellant had acted in self-defence but had used excessive
force in self-defence that he was guilty of manslaughter?

2. Did the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario
err in law in holding that the Learned Trial Judge had adequately instructed
the jury with respect to the qualified defence of provocation?

3. Did the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario err in law in holding
that the Learned Trial Judge had related the consumption of alcohol to the
subjective element of self-defence?

[Page 400]

At the outset of his judgment in the Court of
Appeal Mr. Justice Arnup had occasion to consider the first of these
grounds, at p. 148, saying:

The… most substantial ground is the failure
of the trial Judge to instruct the jury “that if the appellant acted with
excessive force in self-defence he was guilty of manslaughter”. This submission
raises the question whether there exists in Canada a qualified defence arising from the use of excessive force in
self-defence, leading to a verdict of manslaughter in circumstances which would
otherwise result in a conviction for murder.

This question has been raised and discussed
in two cases in this Court, but it has not been necessary previously to decide
whether this qualified defence should be recognized in Ontario.

Mr. Justice Arnup then proceeds with a
thorough review of the relevant cases in various provincial courts and
concludes with an endorsement of the law stated by Martin J.A. in R. v.
Trecroce (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 202 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 211, where he said:

Where excessive force in self-defence has
been recognized as a substantive doctrine, it would appear that the following
conditions, at least, are necessary to give rise to that qualified defence:

(a) The accused must have been justified in
using some force to defend himself against an attack, real or reasonably
apprehended.

(b) The accused must have honestly believed
that he was justified in using the force that he did.

(c) The force used was excessive only
because it exceeded what the accused could reasonably have considered
necessary.

In adopting the reasoning exemplified in the Trecroce
case the Court of Appeal also followed the judgment of Martin J.A. in R.
v. Campbell (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 6 (Ont. C.A.), and found the same
reasoning to be supported by the judgment of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal in R. v. Basarabas and Spek (1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 13. In
conformity with this line of reasoning, Mr. Justice Arnup concluded on
behalf of the Court of Appeal in the present case, at p. 160:

[Page 401]

In the light of the decisions of the Courts
of Appeal of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, and upon consideration
of the careful review of the subject by Martin J.A. in Campbell, supra and
Trecroce, supra, I have reached the conclusion that the doctrine of
excessive force in self-defence rendering the accused guilty only of
manslaughter instead of murder should be recognized in Ontario.

In my opinion the decisions to which
Mr. Justice Arnup refers in this passage are undoubtedly supportive of the
conclusion which he reached and consistent also with the then widely recognized
view of the effect of “the doctrine of excessive force” in a murder case.
Mr. Justice Arnup’s unanimous opinion was delivered on March 9, 1982;
however, the same question was differently decided in this Court in the case of
R. v. Faid which was subject of a unanimous judgment delivered by
Mr. Justice Dickson on March 1, 1983 and now reported at [1983] 1 S.C.R.
265, where he said in the course of his reasons for judgment, at p. 271:

The position of the Alberta Court of Appeal
that there is a “half-way” house outside s. 34 of the Code is, in my
view, inapplicable to the Canadian codified system of criminal law, it lacks
any recognizable basis in principle, would require prolix and complicated jury
charges and would encourage juries to reach compromise verdicts to the
prejudice of either the accused or the Crown. Where a killing has resulted from
the excessive use of force in self-defence the accused loses the justification
provided under s. 34. There is no partial justification open under the section.
Once the jury reaches the conclusion that excessive force has been used the
defence of self-defence has failed.

As this Court is bound by these observations it
is clear to me that, on this basis alone, the first ground of appeal should be
answered in the negative, but it is, in any event, significant that
Mr. Justice Arnup found further ground for supporting the trial judge’s
charge saying, at p. 162:

I conclude that the trial Judge in the
present case did not err in omitting to charge the jury on excessive force in
self-defence. Such a defence was not “revealed by the evidence” and was never
raised by the defence.

[Page 402]

As his second ground of appeal the appellant
challenges the adequacy of the trial judge’s charge to the jury upon the
qualified defence of provocation. The following language in the charge was
objected to in this Court as it was in the Ontario Court of Appeal:

You will also ask yourselves, was the
provocation such that it would have led a person with the physical and mental
condition of the accused to respond this way?

It was urged by the appellant that such language
invited the jury to wrongly consider the conduct of someone other than the
accused. I agree with Mr. Justice Arnup that although the above passage
may perhaps be open to this criticism when viewed in isolation, the jury could
not have been misled by it when it is read in the context of the whole charge
upon provocation.

The final ground of appeal advanced by the
appellant raises a challenge to the adequacy of the trial judge’s charge to the
jury upon the defence of self-defence as codified in subs. 34(1) and (2) of the
Criminal Code . Section 34  reads as follows:

34. (1)
Every one who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is
justified in repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to
cause death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable
him to defend himself.

(2) Every one who is unlawfully assaulted
and who causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is justified
if

(a) he causes it under reasonable
apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm from the violence with which the
assault was originally made or with which the assailant pursues his purposes,
and

(b) he believes, on
reasonable and probable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve himself from
death or grievous bodily harm.

In the appellant’s submission, the trial judge
ought to have told the jury, when instructing them under both subsections, that
they must consider the evidence of intoxication in deciding whether they were
left in reasonable doubt about whether the accused had acted within the legal
definition of self-defence.

[Page 403]

Consideration of the appellant’s argument is
complicated by the fact that a concession was made on behalf of the accused in
the court below which is described by Mr. Justice Arnup, at pp. 162-63, as
follows:

Next it was submitted that the trial judge
erred in failing to instruct the jury that the consumption of alcohol was a
factor to be taken into account in considering the subjective elements in
self-defence. The same complaint was made as to the charge on provocation. It
is conceded by counsel that the trial Judge specifically mentioned intoxication
in relation to both self-defence and provocation.

.

In my view, the charge taken as a whole was
adequate in relating intoxication to self‑defence and provocation.
[Emphasis added]

As it is possible to construe the judgment of
the Court of Appeal as depending, at least in part, upon the appellant’s
concession, I have reviewed the portion of the trial judge’s charge devoted to
self-defence and I can find no mention of the accused’s intoxication and any
relevance it might carry. The appellant withdrew his concession before this
Court and full argument was heard upon the issue from both parties.

In my view, nothing now turns upon the
concession for the following reasons. First of all, s. 34(1) is no longer
in issue in this case because the appellant admits that the jury found the
accused possessed the requisite intention for murder according to s. 212 (a)
of the Criminal Code . Section 34(1)  is not available to an accused
where the jury finds the force he has used was intended to cause death.

In so far as s. 34(2) is concerned, it is my
opinion the trial judge was not required to instruct the jury that the
accused’s intoxication was relevant. The only way drunkenness could arguably be
said to be relevant to s. 34(2) would be if it had induced in the accused a
mistaken appreciation of the facts which, if true, would have justified the
force he used as legitimate self-defence. In other words, it could be argued
that his intoxication is relevant if it induced him to mistakenly apprehend
death or grievous bodily harm or mistakenly

[Page 404]

believe that he could not otherwise preserve
himself from death or grievous bodily harm.

Subsection (2) of s. 34 places in issue the
accused’s state of mind at the time he caused death. The subsection can
only afford protection to the accused if he apprehended death or grievous
bodily harm from the assault he was repelling and if he believed he could not
preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm otherwise than by the force
he used. Nonetheless, his apprehension must be a reasonable one and his
belief must be based upon reasonable and probable grounds. The
subsection requires that the jury consider, and be guided by, what they
decide on the evidence was the accused’s appreciation of the situation and his
belief as to the reaction it required, so long as there exists an objectively
verifiable basis for his perception.

Since s. 34(2) places in issue the accused’s
perception of the attack upon him and the response required to meet it, the
accused may still be found to have acted in self-defence even if he was
mistaken in his perception. Reasonable and probable grounds must still exist
for this mistaken perception in the sense that the mistake must have been one
which an ordinary man using ordinary care could have made in the same
circumstances.

This statutory requirement of reasonableness is
what distinguishes the defence provided by s. 34(2) from the general law
upon mistake of fact expressed in Pappajohn v. The Queen, [1980] 2
S.C.R. 120. In the Pappajohn case it was held that an honest, but
mistaken belief in facts which, if true, would render the accused’s act
innocent was sufficient to prevent him from forming the mens rea essential
to all criminal liability; there was no legal necessity that the mistaken
belief be based upon reasonable grounds. It was accepted that intoxication
could potentially induce such a mistake of fact.

The fatal difficulty with the appellant’s
argument in this case is that although intoxication can be a factor in inducing
an honest mistake, it

[Page 405]

cannot induce a mistake which must be based upon
reasonable and probable grounds. The perspective of the reasonable man which
the language of s. 34(2) places in issue here is the objective standard the law
commonly adopts to measure a man’s conduct. A reasonable man is a man in full
possession of his faculties. In contrast, a drunken man is one whose ability to
reason and to perceive is diminished by the alcohol he has consumed.

I should not be taken as saying that the defence
under s. 34(2) can never be available to a person who is intoxicated. An
intoxicated man may hold a reasonable belief, i.e. the same belief a
sober man would form viewing the matter before him upon reasonable and probable
grounds. Where he does so, however, it is in spite of his intoxication.

The requirement of an objective basis for the
accused’s perception of the facts, whether it be mistaken or accurate,
eliminates any relevance that evidence of the accused’s intoxication might have
had to self-defence under s. 34(2). Naturally, if the accused is intoxicated,
he is not deprived of the defence provided by the subsection so long as
the objective test is met by the existence of reasonable and probable grounds
for the accused’s perception of the nature of the assault upon him and the
response required to meet it.

It follows that I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Murder—Charge to jury—Burden of
proof—Two versions of events surrounding homicide presented in
evidence—Self-defence—Misdirection—New trial ordered—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, s. 613(1)(b)(iii).

Appellant was charged with first-degree
murder. At trial, two different versions of the circumstances surrounding the
homicide were presented in evidence: that of the accused, corroborated by his
concubine, and that of the witness for the Crown. The trial judge directed the
jury on the rules of law governing self-defence—one of the defences presented
by the accused—and told them the standard and the burden of proof on the Crown
with regard to establishing the facts which constitute the essential components
of the offence, and the standard applicable to any accused with regard to his
defence arguments. Appellant was convicted of second-degree murder and the
Court of Appeal upheld the conviction. This appeal is to determine whether the
trial judge erred in his directions to the jury.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

The trial judge erred in law on the question
of the burden of proof regarding the contradictory versions of the facts in
issue. An accused benefits from any reasonable doubt at the outset, not merely
if the two versions of the facts are equally consistent with the evidence or
valid. Moreover, the jurors are not limited to choosing between the two
versions. Even if they do not believe the accused, they cannot accept the other
version of the facts unless they are satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that
the events in fact took place in the manner in which the witness for the Crown
related them. Otherwise the accused is entitled to the finding of fact more
favourable to him provided that it is based on evidence in the record and not
mere speculation.

[Page 571]

Furthermore, the trial judge also erred in
law on the question of the burden of proof when he told the jurors that the
accused had to prove his defence of self-defence beyond all reasonable doubt.
The accused was entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt raised by the
evidence respecting this defence.

Finally, section 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  should not be applied in this case. The Crown did
not show that, if it had been directed in accordance with the law, the jury
would necessarily have brought in a verdict of guilty.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal[1],
dismissing appellant’s appeal from his conviction of second-degree murder.
Appeal allowed.

Michel Proulx and Richard Masson, for the
appellant.

Robert Lévesque, for the respondent.

English version of the judgment of the Court
delivered by

LAMER J.—In this appeal, the applicable
principles of law are well-known and are not in any way at issue. Rather, the
question is whether the trial judge erred in law in his directions to the jury,
and if so, whether his error was such that a new trial should be held. The
Court of Appeal of Quebec
considered that it should not. While agreeing with this conclusion, the Crown
is asking this Court, if necessary, to apply the provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .

Appellant killed a man named Francœur with a
rifle shot. He was charged with first-degree murder, and convicted of
second-degree murder by a jury in New Carlisle, in the Gaspé area.

The incident occurred in the apartment of the
accused’s concubine, Miss Linda Caissy. One Landry, who said he was present in
the apartment when the incident occurred, testified as to the circumstances
surrounding the homicide. According to the accused and his concubine, Landry
was not there, and they both gave the same version of the events leading to the
killing of Francœur, but one which differed from that of Landry.

[Page 572]

Appellant presented five grounds, each charging
that the judge had erred in his directions to the jury. In my opinion, the
first ground, having regard to the burden of proof in criminal proceedings,
succeeds, and requires that this Court order a new trial; it is therefore
unnecessary to deal with the others.

For reasons which it is not necessary to
elaborate, the judge had a duty, which he discharged, to direct the jurors on
the rules of law governing “self-defence”. He also had a duty, as in all cases,
to inform them of the standard and the burden of proof applicable to the Crown,
with regard to establishing the facts which constitute the essential components
of the offence, as well as the standard applicable to any accused with regard
to his defence arguments, in particular that of self-defence.

Appellant argues that he erred in law on these
questions when he dealt with the burden of proof regarding the two versions of
the incident, and regarding self-defence.

The Two Versions

After telling them they had to choose between
the two versions, the judge explained the jury’s task to them as follows:

[TRANSLATION] YOU have heard the analysis
given of the two (2) versions throughout the day, and I do not intend to repeat
it. I will simply say that in deciding how you make your choice, you must have
one thing clearly in mind: you must choose the more persuasive, the
clearer version, the one which provides a better explanation of the
facts, which is more consistent with the other facts established in the evidence.

You must keep in mind that, as the accused
has the benefit of the doubt on all the evidence, if you come to the conclusion
that the two (2) versions are equally consistent with the evidence, are
equally valid, you must give - you must accept the version more favourable to
the accused. These are the principles on which you must make your choice
between the two (2) versions.

(Emphasis added.)

With respect, this direction is in error. The
accused benefits from any reasonable doubt at the outset, not merely if “the
two (2) versions are

[Page 573]

equally consistent with the evidence, are
equally valid”. Moreover the jury does not have to choose between two versions.
It is not because they would not believe the accused that they would then have
to agree with Landry’s version. The jurors cannot accept his version, or any
part of it, unless they are satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt, having
regard to all the evidence, that the events took place in this manner;
otherwise, the accused is entitled, unless a fact has been established beyond a
reasonable doubt, to the finding of fact the most favourable to him, provided
of course that it is based on evidence in the record and not mere speculation.

Self-Defence

The judge told the jurors more than once that
the accused had the benefit of a reasonable doubt at all times, and that the
Crown had a duty to prove each of the component parts of the crime. Dealing
with self-defence, he told them:

[TRANSLATION] I should tell you that here
too, on self-defence, as on all the other defences which he may present, the
accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt in the event you are undecided
whether any one component of the crime has been established.

Further, he said:

[TRANSLATION] In the event you conclude
that the version of Nadeau and that of Linda Caissy should be accepted, you
must examine self-defence: if you accept self-defence, you may bring in a
verdict of acquittal.

In the event you conclude that
self-defence was not established beyond all doubt,
then you must examine the evidence to determine whether, at the time he fired
this shot in the particular circumstances of the case, the accused could have
formed—was capable of forming the specific intent of murder.

(Emphasis added.)

Although the jury requested and received further
directions on other aspects of the law applicable in the circumstances, this
direction was the final one given by the judge on self‑defence. With
respect, it is in error. Any reasonable doubt as regards his being in self‑defence
raised by the evidence enures to the accused, and he certainly

[Page 574]

does not have to show beyond all reasonable
doubt that he was placed in a position of self‑defence.

In all fairness to the judge, I assume he meant
to tell the jurors that, if they were satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt
that the accused was not in a position of self-defence, they should not
thereupon immediately conclude that he was guilty, but should consider whether
he “was capable of forming the specific intent of murder”. I feel certain that this
is what the judge intended and thought he was telling the jury, since the judge
in question is one of experience and great ability. Unfortunately, this is not
what he said, and I can only conclude that the jurors could have been given the
wrong impression as to the burdens of proof; particularly with regard to the
preliminary choice which they could make, and might even have been required to
make, of “the more persuasive … version”.

The Crown suggested that this Court apply
s. 613(1) (b)(iii). I have read the evidence in the record, and I am
of the opinion that the Crown did not show the Court that, if it had been
properly instructed in law, the jury would necessarily have brought in a
verdict of second‑degree murder, as it did.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal dismissing the appeal, and order a new trial on a charge
of second-degree murder.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ALBERTA

Criminal law—Res judicata—Issue
estoppel—Separate trials for commission of two robberies—Accused’s statements
ruled inadmissible at first trial—Whether Crown estopped from relitigating the
question of admissibility of accused’s statements at second trial—Whether
“issue estoppel” should extend to findings on voir dire.

Appellant was charged with two counts of
robbery and tried separately on each count. At the first trial, following a voir
dire, statements made by the accused were declared inadmissible and the
accused was acquitted. The second trial took place before a different judge.
Despite the accused’s objections that the Crown was estopped from relitigating
the issue of voluntariness of the statements, the trial judge held a voir
dire and admitted the statements. The accused was subsequently convicted.
His appeal from conviction and sentence was dismissed.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The Crown is not estopped from relitigating
the admissibility of a statement made by an accused and ruled inadmissible by a
judge holding a voir dire in a previous criminal proceeding. In the
absence of a right of appeal for findings on voir dire held during a
preliminary inquiry and in the absence of an autonomous appeal for findings on voir
dire held during trial, it is not desirable to extend the doctrine of res
judicata to such findings and to depart from the traditional approach of
the doctrine in the field of interlocutory findings.

John James, for the appellant.

Peter Martin, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—Is the Crown estopped from relitigating
the admissibility of a statement made by the accused which was ruled upon as
inadmissible by a judge holding a voir dire in a previous criminal
proceeding?

That is the issue raised by the facts of this
case.

The Facts

Charged with two counts of robbery in the same
indictment the accused moved successfully for severance. The trial of the first
of the two counts resulted in a directed verdict of acquittal. Indeed, the only
evidence tendered by the Crown was an alleged adoption through nods and
statements of a statement made by a third party. Following a voir dire the
statements were declared inadmissible. The trial for the other count took place
before a different judge, who, over the accused’s objections based on
“estoppel”, held a voir dire and admitted the statements as free and
voluntary. The accused was convicted. At the preliminary inquiry the magistrate,
subsequent to a voir dire, had found the statements admissible.

The Court of Appeal

The judgment of the Court of Appeal of Alberta (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 538, was
written by Moir J.A. and, as usual, is a thorough exposition of the law and
analysis of its application to the facts of the case at bar.

[Page 557]

At first he acknowledged that “issue estoppel”
is part of the criminal law, any doubt there may have existed on the matter
having been settled by the unanimous decision of this Court in Gushue v. The
Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 798.

He then referred to “issue estoppel” as being
derived from the concept of res judicata, and said that it “originates
in the “estoppel per rem judicatam” “aspect of res judicata. As
regards that particular aspect, he quoted Spencer Bower, The Doctrine of Res
Judicata, 2nd ed., by A.K. Turner, London, Butterworths, 1969, that
identifies the supportive policy considerations (referred to as “theories”) of
the doctrine as being “the general interest of the community in the termination
of disputes” (expedit reipublicae ut sit finis litium) and “the right of
the individual to be protected from vexatious multiplication of suits and
prosecutions” (nemo debet bis vexari pro uno et eodem delicto).

Moir J.A., having identified the particular
aspect of the doctrine of res judicata he felt applicable to the case at
bar as being “estoppel per rem judicatam” and its two
aforementioned supportive policy considerations, went on to quote with approval
Spencer Bower as to the constituent elements of estoppel per rem judicatam, as
follows (at p. 542):

The necessary constituents of estoppel
per rem judicatam

19 Any party who is desirous of setting up res
judicata by way of estoppel, whether he is relying on such res judicata as
a bar to his opponent’s claim, or as the foundation of his own, and who has
taken the preliminary steps required in order to qualify him for that purpose,
must establish all the constituent elements of an estoppel of this description,
as already indicated in the general proposition enunciated at the commencement
of this chapter. That is to say, the burden is on him of establishing (except
as to any of them which may be expressly or impliedly admitted) each and every
of the following:

(i). that the alleged judicial decision was
what in law is deemed such;

(ii) that the particular judicial decision
relied upon was in fact pronounced, as alleged;

(iii) that the judicial tribunal
pronouncing the decision had competent jurisdiction in that behalf;

[Page 558]

(iv) that the judicial decision was final;

(v) that the judicial decision was, or
involved, a determination of the same question as that sought to be
controverted in the litigation in which the estoppel is raised;

(vi) that the parties to the judicial
decision, or their privies, were the same persons as the parties to the
proceeding in which the estoppel is raised, or their privies, or that the
decision was conclusive in rem.

He then found as lacking, and fatal to
appellant’s case, two of those constituent elements: “Finality”, and “Identity
of issues”.

On “finality” he said (at p. 543):

From this arises the related issue as to
whether or not interlocutory matters can found an issue estoppel. It seems in
principle they can do so but only for a limited purpose. By its very definition,
an interlocutory issue is not a final judgment. However, a decision on the
interlocutory question may be final and conclusive for the purpose of the
proceedings in which it is adjudicated. Outside of those proceedings, however,
it cannot bind the parties because it was not a final determination of any
issue essential to the verdict.

On “identity” the essence of what he said is in
the following passage of his judgment (at p. 544):

Clearly, the key is to determine whether
the issue sought to be estopped is fundamental to the prior decision. This
contemplates the premise that the prior decision could not have been obtained
without the point in issue being resolved in favour of the party urging the
estoppel. Collateral matters cannot found an estoppel. Only fundamental matters
lead to that result.

and later on, when concluding, he commented on
both elements as follows (at pp. 548-49):

Applying the tests of finality and identity
of issue of this case is all that remains to be done. On the surface it appears
that the ruling made at the earlier trial cannot be challenged; it is to this
extent final and conclusive. However, it is clear that the ruling cannot apply
to the ruling made by the Provincial Court Judges: Kaufman, Admissibility of
Confessions, 3rd ed. (1979), p. 63. Nor

[Page 559]

can the ruling of one trial Judge bind
another where a new trial is ordered: R. v. Hilson (1958), 121 C.C.C.
139 at p. 142, 15 D.L.R. (2d) 725 at p. 727, 28 C.R. 262 at
p. 266. This is so even though, at the first trial the statement was ruled
admissible and the Court of Appeal found nothing wrong with the ruling. This
appears to me to say that it is for the trial Judge to determine admissibility
on the evidence before him and he is not bound by the interlocutory rulings made
at an earlier trial even though the statement is the same.

Further, the identity of issue position is
clearly fatal to the appellant’s position. The issue sought to be estopped must
be clearly and unequivocally decided by the Court in the first proceeding as a
fundamental step in the logic of the decision. The appellant relies upon the
specific finding of the first trial Judge where he specifically held the
statement was not voluntary and therefore inadmissible. It is true the issue on
the voir dire was identical. That is a far cry from establishing that
the decision of the first trial Judge was fundamental to the acquittal. As it
is put by Spencer Bower and Turner (para. 211): “Is the determination… so
fundamental to the substantive decision that the latter cannot stand without
the former”.

The substantive decision is the verdict of
acquittal. The interim ruling merely decided that the statement was not
admissible. It did not decide any substantive rights. It did not decide an
issue of fact or law fundamental to the guilt or innocence of the appellant on
the first robbery charge.

If one approaches the finding upon a voir
dire on the admissibility of statements made by an accused as if it were
the usual interlocutory finding on the admissibility of evidence, where
relevancy and the probative value of facts are central to the determination,
then I agree that such a decision would never enjoy the finality even less the
identity required to bring into play the doctrine of issue estoppel. Indeed,
the circumstances considered by the judge in deciding the admissibility of a
particular piece of evidence are directly related to the facts to be proved in
support of the charge and to the nature of the evidence being adduced.
Admissibility of such evidence is to be

[Page 560]

determined in the light of the factual setting
of each case. Of course there cannot be estoppel and, on this, I cannot but
agree with Moir J.A. But there is, I respectfully submit, a great difference
between such determinations and those where the finding is unrelated to
innocence and guilt and the circumstances being considered have nothing
whatsoever to do with the material or mental elements of the alleged crime.
Such is the case when, for example, the Crown wishes to adduce evidence
electromagnetically obtained (s. 178.11  Cr.C .); as will possibly be the
case for certain findings on evidence under s. 24(2)  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . And such is also the case for voir dires
on “confessions”.

A voir dire on the admissibility of a statement
made by an accused has been properly coined “a trial within a trial”. (See for
example, Fred Kaufman, The Admissibility of Confessions, 3rd ed.,
Toronto, The Carswell Co. Ltd., 1979, at p. 35.)

The issue is the admissibility of the
statement irrespective of its content. The trial of that issue is held by a
trier other than the trier of fact, and this is so even though they may be the
same physical person: the judge holding the voir dire is acting in a
different capacity than when considering the statement’s probative value as a
trier of fact. The facts relevant to the issue are foreign to the issue of
guilt. They concern the circumstances leading up to and of the making of the
statement and have nothing to do with those of the alleged offence. The accused
may testify and his cross-examination is limited to those facts, and the Crown
cannot ask questions pertaining to the offence, though some judgments have held
that he may, for the sole purpose of assessing his credibility, be asked
whether his statement was true. In fact it is conceivable, were the law to
permit so (and I think in many ways desirable in terms of saving time,
specially that of jurors and witnesses), that the voir dire be held
outside the proceedings dealing with the offence, even before. Though the
state-

[Page 561]

ment itself is tendered as relevant to
innocence or guilt, its admissibility, based on the circumstances surrounding
its being made, is a completely autonomous question. And for that reason, lack
of finality or of identity with an issue necessarily a component of the finding
of guilt or of innocence is to me, with respect, of no relevance in deciding
this case.

The question to be now addressed is,
whether or not the particular nature of these interlocutory findings would justify
an extension of the doctrine so as to apply to them. They have not yet been put
within the reach of the doctrine by most of the common law jurisdictions that
have extended issue estoppel to criminal law (save the States of Illinois in People
v. Williams, 322 N.E. 2d 461 (1975), and Michigan, in People v. Gray, 222 N.W.
2d 515 (1974), and People v. Mann, 280 N.W. 2d 577 (1979), and one
decision in Canada, R. v. Bellisimo (1980), 4 W.C.B. 453 (Ont. Co. Ct.).

Much has been written and said on issue
estoppel and res judicata.

Although res judicata has, since the
decision of this Court in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729,
become a term of art in Canada,
I will refer to it in its broadest and traditional sense.

A clear exposition on the matter may be
found in Martin L. Friedland’s Double Jeopardy, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1969, and more recently in Jacques Fortin’s Preuve
pénale, Montréal, Éditions Thémis Inc., 1984, and need not be repeated here
at any length.

In short, res judicata means
“something that has clearly been decided” and is the reason given by the Romans
and the legal systems stemming from theirs, such as ours, to a doctrine that
strives to achieve the following:

[Page 562]

Having regard to fairness to an accused

(a) that a person not be put in jeopardy once
again after an acquittal (autrefois acquit);

(b) that a person not be punished twice for the
same conduct (autrefois convict and the Kienapple principle);

and, having regard to the efficiency and
reputation of the judicial system,

(c) that matters that have been fully litigated
between parties be not reopened, over and over;

(d) that the scandal of conflicting decisions be
avoided.

This case illustrates the undesirability of
relitigation, as being costly and time consuming, and prone to the risk of
conflicting decisions.

There is no doubt in my mind that if there is a
bar to an extension of the doctrine of res judicata to rulings on
confession voir dires, it does not stem from principle or logic. It is
desirable that we avoid relitigation of the issue and, as in this case, the
risk of conflicting decisions. And, if a voir dire is “a trial within a
trial” logic commands such an extension unless there are overriding reasons not
to do so. In fact, I even think the doctrine could be extended in such cases
beyond its actual application to criminal matters so as to introduce
“mutuality” (i.e. a finding being a bar not only to the Crown but to the
accused when adverse to his interest). Indeed, mutuality of issue estoppel has
been excluded in criminal law because of the Crown’s burden of proving in each
and every case all of the elements of the offence. But as I have already said,
the facts relevant to the finding and the finding itself on such a voir dire
are foreign to the facts to be proved by the Crown as regards the
commission of the offence by the accused; therefore, what would inure to the
Crown through “mutuality” of the finding in no way relaxes its burden of
proving facts.

[Page 563]

Be that as it may, I do not think it desirable
that we extend the doctrine, with or without “mutuality”, to such findings.

To begin with, I cannot see the doctrine develop
so as to include the findings on the voir dires held at preliminaries.
Indeed, when considering the voir dire per se, “the trial” within a “trial”
is no less a “trial” because it is held in the course of a preliminary. But
there is one major reason against the extension: there is no appeal, and error
is generally subject to limited review. This is sufficient to deal with that
aspect.

At the trial level, the situation as regards
appeal is not much better. Though the voir dire is in a sense
autonomous, it is nevertheless totally dependent upon the main trial for its
appeal process. Let us postulate error on the part of the judge in determining
the admissibility of the statement. If the statement is wrongly excluded, even
through error of law, but the accused nevertheless convicted, benefit of the
doctrine of res judicata would then be founded upon an error of law
beyond the reach of redress. Indeed, the Crown has no appeal from that
conviction. Similarly, if the statement is excluded through error of fact, and
the accused acquitted, again the erroneous finding is beyond the reach of the
courts as the Crown’s right to appeal is limited to matters of law.

If mutuality is introduced, matters are even
worse. A statement wrongfully admitted in proceedings resulting in an acquittal
would follow and prejudice an accused throughout all of his other trials.

If we exclude mutuality, all findings at
preliminary inquiries and for the same reason those findings at trial that are
beyond the reach of review through appeal, the doctrine could then only find
application when the statement is excluded, the accused acquitted and the
exclusion is based on an error of law. This offers very little payload in terms
of avoiding relitigation and noth-

[Page 564]

ing or little as regards avoiding the danger of
conflicting decisions.

The change to the law being a major departure
from the traditional approach of the doctrine in the field of interlocutory
findings, I think there is a burden placed upon whomsoever invites the change
to satisfy this Court that there is clear advantage to the administration of
justice in developing the law in this direction.

In the absence of an autonomous appeal of such
findings, I do not think that appellant has made that case.

I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Causing a fire—Proof of
offence—Charge of causing a fire by violating law in place where fire caused
death or damage—Statutory presumption of fire being wilfully set if
non-compliance with fire-prevention or fire-safety law—Whether or not
presumption applicable—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 392(1)(a),(b),
(2).

Appellant, the owner of a Toronto boarding house which burned down
causing four deaths, failed to comply with the City’s fire prevention by-law
and was charged with causing a fire under s. 392(1)(b) of the Code. The
Crown alleged that the loss of life would not have occurred if appellant had
complied with the by-law. The trial judge ruled, as a preliminary matter, that
the “deeming” provision of s. 392(2) did not apply to a charge under s. 392(1)(b).
Appellant was then arraigned and, as the Crown had planned to rely on the
“deeming” provision, was acquitted in the absence of evidence. The Ontario Court
of Appeal reversed the trial judge’s ruling and ordered a new trial. This
appeal was heard without any adjudication on the merits.

Held (Estey J.
dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Ritchie,
Beetz, Chouinard and Wilson JJ.: Section 392(2) should not be construed as
applying to s. 392(1)(b) since violation of a fire-prevention or
fire-safety law (as provided for under s. 392(2)), is already covered by s.
392(1)(b) as a violation of any law in force where the fire occurred. To
eliminate the distinction between fire-prevention and fire-safety laws and any
other kinds of laws would defeat the clear intention of Parliament.
Section 392(2), however, clearly extended s. 392(1)(a) from acts or
omissions of the accused which were a direct cause of fire to circumstances in
which the accused’s acts or omissions were an indirect cause of fire

[Page 527]

or of resultant death or destruction,
provided a fire-prevention or fire-safety law had been violated.

The “plain meaning” rule of statutory
interpretation supports an application of s. 392(2) to s. 392(1)(a) only
as wilfulness is relevant only under that paragraph and not under
s. 392(1)(b).

Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer J.: An ambiguity that persists after an analysis through the
application of the canons of construction must be resolved in favour of the
liberty of the subject. This rule applies not only to enactments creating
offences but also to certain enactments curtailing the subject’s liberty in
some other way and to enactments relieving in part the Crown of its usual
evidentiary burden. Since the effect of s. 392(2) is to relieve the Crown in
part of its traditional evidentiary burden and given the persistent ambiguity
of the scope of this section, s. 392(2) must be given an interpretation
favouring the liberty of the subject and so be limited to a charge under s.
392(1)(a).

v. Alter (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 381, applied; R. v. Rist (1976),

referred to.]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court
of Appeal (1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 330, allowing an appeal from an acquittal by
Graburn Co. Ct. J. and ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed, Estey J.
dissenting.

Derek A. Danielson, for the appellant.

David H. Doherty, for the respondent.

The reasons of Dickson C.J. and Lamer J. were
delivered by

LAMER J.—I have read the reasons of my colleague
Madame Justice Wilson and agree that s. 392(2) does not apply to a charge laid
under s. 392(1)(b). Accordingly, I agree that this appeal

[Page 528]

should be allowed and the trial judge’s
acquittal restored.

A reading of s. 392 discloses an ambiguity that
both Martin J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal and my colleague attempt to
resolve by seeking to identify the purpose of the relevant legislation.

I must admit, with respect, that, while I find
merit in both approaches I find none sufficiently compelling to permit me to
state with any certainty which, in my humble opinion, is the right one.

Given the ambiguity which persists after my own
analysis of the section through an application of the canons of
construction of statutes, I resolve the ambiguity by resorting to the rule
enunciated by Cartwright J. (as he then was) in R. v. Robinson, [1951]
S.C.R. 522, where he said, at p. 536:

In my opinion if the words of an enactment
which is relied upon as creating a new offence are ambiguous, the ambiguity
must be resolved in favour of the liberty of the subject, but whether or not
such ambiguity exists is to be determined after calling in aid the rules of
construction.

See also Marcotte v. Deputy Attorney General
for Canada, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 108, at p. 115.

This rule does not apply only to enactments
creating offences, but also to certain enactments curtailing in some other way
the subject’s liberty, as was the case in Marcotte, supra, and to
enactments relieving in part the Crown of its usual evidentiary burden. Such
was the case in R. v. Noble, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 632. In that case, the
Court was called upon to interpret s. 237(1) (f) of the Criminal
Code , which creates a presumption in favour of the Crown following the
production of a certificate of an analyst in impaired driving cases.

Ritchie J., speaking for the Court, addressed
the matter as follows, at p. 638:

The effect of s. 237 both before and after
the amendment is to establish the conditions under which the certificate of a
qualified technician is admissible, without further evidence, as proof of the
proportion of

[Page 529]

alcohol in the blood of the accused. These
provisions are obviously designed to assist the Crown in proving its case, and
as they serve to restrict the normal rights of the accused to cross-examination
and saddle him with the burden of proving that the certificate does not
accurately reflect his blood alcohol content at the time of the alleged
offence, they are to be strictly construed and, where ambiguous, interpreted in
favour of the accused.

The effect of s. 392(2) is also to relieve the
Crown of part of its traditional evidentiary burden in criminal prosecutions,
and should, given this persistent ambiguity as to the scope of its application,
be given the interpretation which favours “the liberty of the subject”, which
requires that its application be limited to a charge under s.392(1)(a).

The judgment of Ritchie, Beetz, Chouinard and
Wilson JJ. was delivered by

WILSON J.—This appeal raises a pure question of
statutory interpretation of s. 392  of the Criminal Code . The
section reads as follows:

392. (1)
Every one who causes a fire

(a) wilfully, or

(b) by violating a law in force in
the place where the fire occurs,

is, if the fire results in loss of life or
destruction of or damage to property, guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for five years.

(2) For the purposes of this section, the
person who owns, occupies or controls property in which a fire that results in
loss of life or destruction of or damage to property originates or occurs shall
be deemed wilfully to have caused the fire if he has failed to comply with any
law that is intended to prevent fires or that requires the property to be
equipped with apparatus for the purpose of extinguishing fires or for the
purpose of enabling persons to escape in the event of fire, and if it is
established that the fire, or the loss of life, or the whole or any substantial
portion of the destruction of or damage to the property would not have occurred
if he had complied with the law.

[Page 530]

The facts

The facts giving rise to the problem are that
the appellant, the owner of a boarding house in Toronto, failed to comply with the City’s fire prevention by-law with
respect to fire extinguishers, smoke detectors and fire escapes. The boarding
house burned down on October 5, 1980 and four people died in the fire. The
Crown alleged that this loss of life would not have occurred if the appellant
had complied with the by-law.

The appellant appeared before Graburn Co. Ct. J.
charged on the following indictment:

SAEID ABBAS stands charged that he, on or
about the 5th day of October in the year 1980, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, caused a fire at 24
Caroline Avenue by violating a law in force at 24 Caroline Avenue, Toronto,
Ontario, to wit: City of Toronto By-Law #73/68, which fire resulted in the
death of Frederick James Narapecka and Ernie Cullen and Arthur Burton and
Herbert Rose, contrary to the Criminal Code .

Rather than adducing proof of the Crown’s case
and then arguing the legal issues on a defence motion to dismiss, the parties
requested the court to rule as a preliminary matter on the legal issue of
whether the “deeming” provision of s. 392(2)  of the Criminal Code  applies
on a charge under s. 392(1) (b). Although Judge Graburn was not completely
satisfied with this procedure, he complied with the request and, following the
decision of Borins Co. Ct. J. in R. v. Alter (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 381,
ruled that it did not. The appellant was then arraigned; the Crown which had
proposed to rely on the “deeming” provision conceded that it had no evidence to
offer, and the appellant was acquitted.

The Crown appealed to the Ontario Court of
Appeal which reversed Judge Graburn and ordered a new trial. The appellant
filed notice of appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 618(2)(a) of the Code.
Accordingly there has not yet been an adjudication on the merits.

[Page 531]

Section 392  forms part of Part IX of the Code
entitled “Wilful and Forbidden Acts in respect of Certain Property”. Both
“property” and “wilfulness” are defined terms for purposes of this part of the Code,
the definitions being contained in ss. 385 and 386(1) respectively. In the
absence of the deeming provision of s. 392(2) , the word “wilfully” in s.
392(1)(a) would be accorded the meaning given to it in s. 386(1). It
seems clear therefore that s. 392(2)  applies to a charge laid under s. 392(1)(a).

In the present case, however, the indictment
does not allege that the appellant “wilfully” caused a fire. It alleges that he
“caused a fire” by “violating a law in force”. It can be a good indictment,
therefore, only in respect of an offence under s. 392(1)(b). Ironically,
the appellant would not seem to have a case if the indictment had charged him
with “wilfully” causing a fire even though it is apparent that in the ordinary
sense of the word his action or inaction was neither wilful nor a cause of the
fire.

2. Interpretation of section 392 

The question of statutory interpretation posed
on this appeal has already been considered on two separate occasions, first by
Laycraft J. (as he then was) of the Alberta Supreme Court in R. v. Rist (1976),
30 C.C.C. (2d) 119, and then by Borins Co. Ct. J. in Alter, supra. Whereas
the trial judge in Abbas relied on Judge Borins in holding that s.
392(2)  could logically be said to apply only to the offence set out in s.
392(1)(a), the Court of Appeal adopted the reasoning of Mr. Justice
Lay craft and held the “deeming” provision equally applicable to the offence
created in s. 392(1)(b).

In the reasons given by Martin J.A. in the Court
of Appeal (now reported at (1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 330) stress was laid
upon the word “caused” in s. 392(2) . The subsection was perceived as
designed to provide a connection between the violation of “a law in force in
the place where the fire occurs” (s. 392(1)(b)) and any property damage
or deaths resulting from the fire even although the violation

[Page 532]

could not be said to have actually caused the
fire. This view is most forcefully put forward by Lay craft J. in Rist when
he states at pp. 120-21:

I am of the view, however, that s-s. (2) of
s. 392  is designed to give a statutory definition of causing a fire “by
violating a law in force in the place where the fire occurs”. A person is
deemed “wilfully to have caused the fire” if the violations of the local law
are of the class described in s-s. (2). Without such a definition, many of the
acts described in s-s. (2) would not, in the ordinary meaning of the term, be
such as to “cause” a fire but would merely make its results more calamitous.
The statutory definition given relates to s-s. (1)(b) of s. 392 .

With respect, it is difficult to see any
meaningful distinction between paras, (a) and (b) of
s. 392(1) if this view is correct. Yet a distinction was clearly intended.
By s. 392(2) Parliament has clearly extended the offence under s. 392(1)(a)
from acts or omissions of the accused which are the direct cause of a fire to
circumstances in which the accused’s acts or omissions are an indirect cause of
a fire or of the resultant death or destruction. Those acts or omissions,
however, have to constitute violations of fire-prevention or fire-safety laws.
Section 392(1)(b), on the other hand, makes it an offence to cause
a fire by violating any law in force in the place where the fire
occurred if the fire results in death or destruction. To construe s. 392(2) as
applicable to s. 392(1)(b) would make no sense. The violation of a fire‑prevention
or fire-safety law is a violation of “a law in force in the place where the
fire occurs”. It is, in other words, already covered in s. 392(1)(b). I
would respectfully agree with Judge Borins where he says at p. 387 of Alter:

The mischief to which s. 392(1)(a)
and s. 392(2) is directed is [non-]compIiance with fire‑prevention and
fire-safety legislation.

The view adopted by the Court of Appeal in the
present case eliminates the distinction between

[Page 533]

that type of legislation and any other. In this
respect it defeats the clear intention of Parliament.

While the respondent correctly asserts that in
interpreting any statutory provision, including one in the Criminal Code , one
must begin with the proposition that words are to be given their plain meaning
(R. v. Robinson, [1951] S.C.R. 522), the trial judge’s interpretation
seems more consonant with the language used than the interpretation of the
Court of Appeal. The fact that under s. 392(2)  violating certain fire safety
laws is made synonymous with “wilfully” causing the fire would appear to be
relevant only to a charge under s. 392(1) (a). As the offence set out in
s. 392(1) (b) requires no element of wilfulness, the relevance to it of a
subsection whose purpose is to deem to be wilful acts which are otherwise
not wilful is, to say the least, dubious. I do not believe, therefore, that the
respondent can derive much comfort from the plain meaning rule in this case.

As Judge Borins noted in Alter, the
intentional setting of a fire (commonly referred to as arson) is dealt with in
ss. 389 and 390 of the Code and the reckless setting of a fire is
covered by the criminal negligence sections 202, 203 and 204.
Section 392  applies to cases other than arson and to conduct which does
not constitute criminal negligence. The offence in s. 392(1)(b) is made
out where the accused has caused the fire itself by violating a law in force in
the place where the fire occurred i.e. any law including the entire
spectrum of non-fire related laws. By contrast, the criterion for culpability
under s. 392(1)(a) is satisfied where the accused has wilfully caused
the fire or where, by virtue of s. 392(2), he is deemed to have wilfully caused
the fire. He is deemed to have wilfully caused the fire if he has breached a
fire‑prevention or fire-safety law and the death or destruction (but not
necessarily the fire itself) would not have occurred if such law had been
complied with.

[Page 534]

Crown counsel put a great deal of emphasis on
the opening words of s. 392(2), submitting that the phrase “For the purposes of
this section” evidences an intention on the part of Parliament to apply the
“deeming” provision to both offences created by the section. In support of this
submission he directed the Court’s attention to sections such as s. 320(4)
of the Code which deems property obtained by means of an N.S.F. cheque
to have been obtained by false pretenses for purposes of s. 320(1)(a).
Were it not for the express reference to s. 320(1)(a), the respondent
argued, such a “deeming” provision would necessarily apply to all of the
offences created by s. 320 (i.e. those created by ss. 320(1)(b),
(c) and (d) as well). By analogy, the argument went, the s.
392(2) “deeming” provision would contain an express reference to s. 392(1)(a)
if it were intended to apply only to that subsection.

What this argument overlooks, however, is that
unlike s. 392  the various paragraphs of s. 320(1) are drafted without
reference to one another or to any words in the section and as such are
completely self-contained. There is no need to refer to the rest of the
section in order to make sense of s. 320(1)(a). It stands on its
own feet. Accordingly, the “deeming” provision of s. 320(4) can coherently be
applied to that paragraph alone. Paragraph (a) of s. 392(1), on the
other hand, cannot coherently be read without reference to the other language
of s. 392(1). It takes the other language to constitute the offence. Therefore,
regardless of the intent underlying the “deeming” provision of s. 392(2), the
draftsman could not possibly have said “For the purposes of paragraph (a)”.
The structure of s. 392  requires the opening words “For the purposes of this
section” even if subsection (2) were intended to apply only to para. (a).
No assistance is to be gained therefore from this phraseology.

3. Conclusion

It seems to me that the interpretation put Upon
s. 392 by the Court of Appeal in overturning the decision of Judge Graburn has
the effect of all but eliminating any distinction between the offences created
by s. 392(1)(a) and s. 392(1)(b). The

[Page 535]

former is effectively subsumed under the latter.
In view of the evident Parliamentary intention to create two distinct offences,
one arising from certain violations of fire-prevention or fire‑safety
laws and the other from violations of other types of law, such an
interpretation seems inappropriate. In addition, the position put forward by
the respondent and adopted by the Court of Appeal does not appear to be
persuasive as a matter of pure statutory interpretation. In deeming certain
fires to have been wilfully caused by the accused, s. 392(2) must logically be
applicable only to the s. 392(1)(a) offence as the criterion of wilfulness is
relevant only to that offence and not to the offence created by s. 392(1)(b).

Since the appellant was charged under s. 392(1)(b),
and the Crown has conceded that it cannot establish the requisite causal
connection between the by-law violations and the fire if s. 392(2) is
inapplicable, the appeal must be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal
set aside, and the trial judge’s acquittal of the appellant restored.

ON APPEAL FROM
THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ALBERTA

Criminal law — Wiretaps — Authorization — Entry
without consent to plant bug — Whether or not authorization implied power to
plant device through illegal means — Whether or not illegal means for planting
device can be sanctioned by term of judge's authorization — Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 25(1), 178.1, 178.11(1), (2), 178.12(1), 178.13(1),
(2), 178.16, 178.18(1), 178.2 — Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, s.
26(2).

A judge of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench
gave an authorization to intercept private communications but refused to grant
an order authorizing entry upon private premises to install and to remove the
microphone. The Alberta Government, as a result of this judgment, referred two
questions to the Alberta Court of Appeal raising the issues of (1) whether, in
Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code , Parliament intended by necessary
implication to empower police officers to enter private property to install
listening devices when they act under an authorization to intercept private
communications and (2) whether a judge may expressly authorize such entry when
he grants an authorization for an interception of private communications. The
Alberta Court of Appeal answered both questions in the negative.

Held (Dickson and Chouinard JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed
and the two questions should be answered in the affirmative.

Per Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ.: An authorization given by a
judge under Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  authorizes by necessary
implication any person acting under the authorization to enter any place at
which private communications are to be intercepted

[page 698]

to install or to
service a permitted listening device—provided such entry is required to implement
the particular authorization—unless the authorization includes limitations on
or prohibitions of such entry. A judge in giving an authorization has
jurisdiction to expressly authorize a person acting under the authorization to
enter any place at which private communications are to be intercepted to
install or service a device, provided such entry is required to implement the
particular authorization.

Per Dickson and Chouinard JJ. dissenting:
Parliament did not intend that an authorization to intercept private
communications should accord, by necessary implication, the person acting under
its power to enter any place to install, monitor, repair or remove a listening
device. At common law, entry into a person's private premises without either
consent or specific legal authorization has always been unlawful. Unless
authorized by law, a police officer has no more right than an ordinary citizen
to interfere with a person's property. The Court has recently reaffirmed the
longstanding protection the common law accords to rights of property in Colet v.
The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 2, where it unanimously held that a
statutory power to seize firearms did not carry with it, by necessary
implication, a power to enter and search. This decision is a particular application
of a larger canon of statutory interpretation: in general, it will be presumed
in the absence of express statutory language that a legislative body did not
intend to authorize an act unlawful at common law.

While Parliament clearly intended oral communications
should be the subject of interception, there was nothing to indicate that such
communications could not be effectively intercepted without an implied power of
entry. The fact that oral communications could be intercepted more frequently
and more conveniently if a power of entry was inferred does not justify the
implication of such a power. The omission of this power by Parliament from the
otherwise detailed statutory scheme of Part IV.1 is strong indication that it
did not consider such a power either essential or necessary to give effect to
an authorization to intercept oral communications.

The committee reports which were before
Parliament at the time of the introduction of the Protection of Privacy Act, 1973-74 (Can.), c. 50, cannot be used to interpret Part IV.1 of the Code and, in any event, they

[page 699]

do not provide any
substantial support for the view that Parliament intended by necessary
implication to authorize entry in aid of interception.

Subsection 25(1)  of the Criminal Code  cannot
support a right of entry by the police to effect an authorization to intercept
oral communications; this subjection does not augment the powers of the police
beyond those accorded them by the Criminal Code  or at common law.

At common law,
the police have never been entitled to exercise a
general right of entry as part of their powers. Unless specifically authorized
by law, a police officer has no right to enter upon the private property of
another without consent. The situations where entry has been authorized at
common law are exceptional and few in number. R. v. Waterfield, [1963] 3
All E.R. 659 (C.A.), does not stand for the proposition that a power
of entry to private property for the purpose of installing a listening device
can arise simply by virtue of a policeman's general duty to detect crime and
enforce the law. Furthermore, Waterfield provides no assistance where
the conduct of the police is of itself unlawful and has been initiated with
full knowledge of its potential illegality.

Subsection 26(2) of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, is a general deeming provision
which cannot supply authority for conduct that is otherwise unlawful and, in
any event, the conditions for its operation are not fulfilled.

Since Parliament has neither explicitly nor
implicitly granted a person acting under an authorization to intercept private
communications a right of entry, there can be no power in a judge to expressly
grant such power as a term of an authorization pursuant to s. 178.13(2). A
judge acting under a statutory scheme is limited by the authority accorded
under the statute.

The two questions posed in this reference
should be answered in the negative.

The reasons of Dickson and Chouinard JJ. were
delivered by

DICKSON
J. (dissenting)—The
issues this reference presents are (1) whether in
Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  Parliament
intended by necessary implication to empower police officers to enter private
property to install listening devices when they
act under an authorization to intercept private communications and
(2) accordingly, whether a judge may expressly authorize such entry when he
grants an authorization for an interception of private communications.

These questions raise the substantial issue of
the limits Parliament intended to impose upon the interception of private
communications by the police in aid of criminal law enforcement. Equally
important, this reference compels the Court to inquire into societal interests
in conversational privacy protected by the Criminal
Code  as well as the breadth of every citizen's common law right to
the exclusive and unimpaired enjoyment of property.

I Background

In 1982, an application for an authorization to
intercept private communications was made before Mr. Justice D.C. MacDonald of
the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to s. 178.12(1)  of the Criminal Code .

Justice MacDonald gave the authorization after he was satisfied that the requirements
for the grant of an authorization established by s. 178.13(1) 

[page 701]

of the Criminal Code  were fulfilled. At the same time, an
order authorizing the entry upon private premises for the purpose of installing
and removing a microphone or microphones was also sought. MacDonald J. refused
to include such power in the authorization and he gave written reasons at a
later date in support of his refusal. See Re Application for Authorization to Intercept
Private Communications (1982),
31 C.R. (3d) 31 (Alta. Q.B.)

Thereafter,
pursuant to s. 27(1) of the Judicature Act, R.S.A.
1980, c. J-1, the following questions were referred to the Alberta Court of
Appeal by order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council (O.C. 84/83), dated
February 2, 1983:

Does an authorization given by a judge under
Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  (Canada), by necessary implication, authorize
any person acting under the authorization to
enter any place at which private communications are proposed to be
intercepted under the authorization for the purpose of installing, monitoring,
repairing or removing any electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other
device?

Does a judge have jurisdiction, in giving an
authorization under Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  (Canada), to expressly
authorize any person acting under the authorization to enter any place at which
private communications are proposed to be
intercepted under the authorization for the purpose of installing,
monitoring, repairing or removing any electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or
other device?

For the purpose
of hearing and considering the above questions, words and expressions defined in Part
1V.1 of the Criminal Code  (Canada)
have the meanings given to them in that Part.

The Court of Appeal
(McGillivray C.J. and Laycraft, Harradence, Belzil and Stevenson JJ.A.)
answered both questions in the negative: Reference re an Application for an Authorization (1983), 5 D.L.R. (4th) 601. The five
member panel was unanimous in its negative response to the first question. The
majority of the Court also answered the second question in the negative. Chief
Justice McGillivray and Justice Harradence each rendered separate dissenting
reasons for answering the second question in the affirmative.

[page 702]

The Attorney
General of Alberta has now brought an appeal from this decision by virtue of s.
37 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S-19, as amended. He seeks
an affirmative answer to both questions. The Attorney General of Canada, as
well as the Attorneys General of Ontario and Manitoba and the Attorney General
of Québec have all
intervened in support of the position advanced by the Attorney General of
Alberta. By order of Chief Justice McGillivray, Mr. R. B. White was appointed
to act as counsel to represent the opposite view; he appeared in this Court as
well.

II Part IV.1 of
the Criminal Code 

Prior to the
amendment of the Criminal Code  by the Protection of Privacy Act, 1973-74
(Can.), c. 50, the interception of private communications was not regulated by
Parliament. Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  now contains a complete
legislative statement of the legal limits to the invasion of privacy permitted
in the conduct of an investigation.

A review of this
legislation reveals that Parliament has struck a balance between the privacy
interest of the individual and the competing interest of the public in law
enforcement: R. v. Commisso, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 121, at pp. 124-25, per
Lamer J. The interpretation this legislation should receive in light of
this balance of competing interests has been aptly described by Zuber J.A. in
R. v. Welsh and lannuzzi (No. 6) (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 363 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 369:

It is apparent that in enacting the Protection of Privacy Act, 1973-74 (Can.), c. 50, now Part
IV.1 of the Code, Parliament had two objectives.
The first was to protect private communications by prohibiting interception
and to render inadmissible evidence obtained in violation of the statute. The second objective, which balances the first,
was to recognize the need to allow the appropriate authorities, subject to specific controls,
to intercept private communications in the
investigation of serious crime, and to adduce the evidence thus obtained.

This legislation must be viewed and
interpreted with a full, fair and realistic appreciation of both
these objectives.

[page 703]

 The right to
private communication cannot be diluted simply because
unlawful interceptions are made by
honest men whose motives are simply to detect crime.

The main features
of the regulatory scheme Parliament chose to accomplish these competing
objectives are readily apparent. First, a group of indictable offences has been
created prohibiting: (a) the interception of private communications by anyone by
means of any form of listening device (s. 178.11(1)); (b) the purchase, sale or
possession of a listening device (s. 178.18(1)); (c) the disclosure of any
private communication intercepted by the use of any such device (s. 178.2).
Additionally, a court may order punitive damages up to $5,000 be paid to any
person aggrieved by the unauthorized interception of private communication or
the improper disclosure of them. Secondly, Parliament has created, as
exceptions to these prohibitions, procedures subject to judicial control for
the lawful interception of private communications in limited circumstances (ss.
178.11(2), 178.12, 178.13). Finally, Parliament has established rules regarding
the admissibility of evidence obtained by the interception of private communications
(s. 178.16).

The provisions of
Part IV.1 of particular relevance to this appeal are as follows:

178.1 In this Part,

""authorization"" means an
authorization to intercept a private
communication given under section 178.13 or subsection 178.15(2);

""electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical
or other device"" means any device or apparatus that is used or is capable
of being used to intercept a private communication, but does not include a
hearing aid used to correct subnormal hearing of the user to not better than
normal hearing;

[…]

""private communication"" means any
oral communication or any telecommunication made under circumstances in which
it is reasonable for the originator thereof
to expect that it will not be intercepted by any person other than the
person intended by the originator thereof to receive it; 

[…]

[page 704]

178.11 (1) Every one who, by means of an
electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device, wilfully intercepts a
private communication is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to
imprisonment for five years.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to

(a) a person who has
the consent to intercept, express or implied, of the originator of the private
communication or of the person intended by the originator thereof to receive it;

(b) a person who intercepts a private
communication in accordance with an authorization or any person who in good
faith aids in any way a person whom he has reasonable and probable grounds to
believe is acting with any such authorization; 

[…]

178.12 (1) An application
for an authorization shall be made ex parte and in
writing to a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction, or a judge as
defined in section 482 and shall be signed by the Attorney General of the
province in which the application is made or the Solicitor General of Canada or
an agent specially designated in writing for the purposes of this section by

(a) the Solicitor General of Canada
personally, if the offence under investigation is one in respect of which
proceedings, if any, may be instituted at the instance of the Government of
Canada and conducted by or on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada, or

(b) the Attorney General of a province
personally, in respect of any other offence in that province,

and shall be accompanied by an affidavit
which may be sworn on the information and belief of a peace officer or public
officer deposing to the following matters, namely:

(c) the facts relied upon to justify the
belief that an authorization should be given together with particulars of the offence;

(d) the type of private communication
proposed to be intercepted;

(e) the names, addresses and occupations, if
known, of all persons, the interception of whose private communications there

III The Issues

The
first issue the reference poses is whether Parliament intended, by necessary
implication, that an authorization given by a judge should accord the person
acting under the authorization power to enter any place to install, monitor,
repair or remove a listening device. The second question asks whether a judge
may, in granting the authorization, expressly empower the police to make such
entry.

Chief
Justice McGillivray initially requested that all counsel address whether the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  had any impact on these
two questions. The Alberta Court of Appeal did not deal with this point and it
was not canvassed in argument before this Court. Consequently,

[page 706]

 in this reference,
I intend to consider only the questions of statutory interpretation raised.

IV The Existence
of Implied Authority 

(A) The Nature of
the Issue

It is the submission
of the Attorney General and his supporting interveners (hereinafter ""the
appellants"") that the power to enter to install a listening device is
accorded by necessary implication to any person acting under an authorization
granted pursuant to Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code . Nothing in Part IV.1 expressly provides that when
an authorization to intercept private communications is made, the power to
enter in aid of the interception is included. The Attorney General of Alberta
has been compelled to ask, therefore, whether the statute produces that result
by implication and to argue accordingly.

The neutral language
used by the Lieutenant Governor in Council belies the real significance of the
first question and the far-reaching consequences of an affirmative answer to
it. Put plainly, the argument is that Parliament intended, although it did not
expressly so specify, to sanction otherwise unlawful conduct on the part of the
police by permitting them to trespass to intercept private communications.

The police are
entitled to take any lawful action in aid of law enforcement. Thus the power of
the police to enter to install a listening device when to do so would involve
no violation of the law cannot be disputed, so long as this does not conflict
with any of the terms imposed in the authorization. There is no need for
Parliament to approve either expressly or by implication an otherwise lawful
entry undertaken by the police and I do not understand the first question to
place this in issue. It is rather the issue of whether Parliament has
authorized an illegal entry that lies at the heart of the question.

The appellants'
claim that police officers are permitted to enter private premises to install
listening devices is broad and indiscriminate. It is worthwhile to examine
briefly the consequences of

[page 707]

accepting that such
a sweeping right exists. The power so granted would go much further than
authorizing surreptitious entry and would allow the police to act openly and
utilize whatever means to achieve entry they found most expedient. Thus, access
could be obtained by forcing doors or windows or through trickery or coercion.
Further, if police acting under Part IV.1 are implicitly authorized to make
entry, s. 25 of the Code
would permit them to
effect such entry by overcoming force a property owner is normally entitled to
assert, to prevent anyone, including the police, from entering the premises
without permission. If the right exists, it must exist in respect of premises
of persons who, at the time the entry is made, are innocent of any offence as
well as those who have more than passing acquaintance with the criminal
process.

(B) The Common Law of Trespass and Statutory Interpretation

Prima facie, every invasion of property, be it ever
so minute and negligible, is a trespass and therefore unlawful. Such trespass
may not amount to crime since ""breaking the close"" simpliciter is not a criminal offence. Nonetheless,
entry into the premises of another without either consent or specific legal
authorization has always been tortious and unlawful. It is an interference with
the common law right to peaceful enjoyment of one's property that has been
recognized at least since Semayne's Case (1604),
5 Co. Rep. 91 a; 77 E.R. 194 (K.B.), where it was said at p. 195: ""That
the house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well as for his
defence against injury and violence, as for his repose .... ""

As well, it is the
gist of the following oft-quoted passage from the great case Entick v. Carrington (1765), 2 Wils. K.B. 275; 95 E.R. 807,
at p. 817:

... our law holds the property of every man
so sacred, that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour's close without
his leave; if he does he is a trespasser, though he

[page 708]

does no damage at all; if he will tread upon
his neighbour's ground, he must justify it by law.

The
inviolability of a person's property has from earliest times been vigorously
asserted and resolutely defended by the courts. Unless lawfully authorized, a
police officer has no more right than an ordinary citizen to interfere with a
person's property.

The
long standing protection the law has accorded rights of property was reaffirmed
recently by this Court in Colet v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 2. The issue in Colet was whether a statutory power to seize firearms carried with it, by
necessary implication, a power to enter and search. Ritchie J., writing for the
unanimous Court, concluded it did not. In his opinion, the police were not
entitled to invade the private rights of individuals unless they were expressly
authorized to do so.

In
rejecting the argument of the Crown that a right of entry and a power of search
should be implied, Ritchie J. had this to say, at pp. 8 and 9:

In the final analysis this appeal raises the
all important question of whether the property rights of the individual can be
invaded otherwise than with specific statutory authority. It is true that the
appellant's place of residence was nothing more than a shack or shelter which no doubt was considered inappropriate by the
city of Prince Rupert, but what is involved here is the longstanding
right of a citizen of this country to the control
and enjoyment of his own property, including the right to determine who
shall and who shall not be permitted to invade it. The common law principle has
been firmly engrafted in our law since Semayne's
case.... 

[…]

. . . it would in
my view be dangerous indeed to hold that the private
rights of the individual to the exclusive enjoyment of his own property are to
be subject to invasion by police officers
whenever they can be said to be acting in the furtherance of the
enforcement of any section of the Criminal
Code  although they are not armed with express authority to justify
their action.

[page 709]

The decision in Colet is a particular application of a larger canon of statutory
interpretation. This canon embodies the presumption in favour of vested rights
(see Duff C.J. in Spooner Oils Ltd. v.
Turner Valley Gas Conservation Board, [1933] S.C.R. 629, at p. 638)
as well as the presumption that express language must be found to demonstrate
that a legislative body intended to authorize an act otherwise unlawful at
common law. On the necessity of express language see also: S.G.G. Edgar, Craies
on Statute Law (7th ed. 1971), pp.
121-22; E.A. Driedger, The Composition of
Legislation (1957), p. 127; P. St.J. Langan, Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (12th
ed. 1969), p. 116.

The requirement for express language was
recently invoked by the House of Lords in Morris
v. Beardmore, [1980]
2 All E.R. 753. This case raised a question analogous to the one at hand. It
involved the power of a constable to require a person to undergo a breath test
and the constable's purported right to enter and remain on the person's
property to enforce that requirement. The submission was made there, as it is
made here, that because there was no express provision prohibiting such entry
the right should be inferred. Lord Diplock disposed of this argument in these
words, at p. 757:

But, with respect, the boot is on the other leg; if Parliament intends
to authorise the doing of an
act which would constitute a tort actionable at the suit of the person
to whom the act is done, this requires express
provision in the statute ... .

The presumption
is that in the absence of express provision to the contrary Parliament did not intend to authorise tortious conduct ....

See also the opinions of Lord Edmund-Davies,
at p. 759, and Lord Scarman, at p. 763.

To the same effect is the statement of Lord
Keith in Finnigan v. Sandiford, [1981]
2 All E.R. 267 (H.L.), at p. 271, in reference to a purported power to enter,
"" . . . Parliament cannot be taken to have authorised any further inroads
on the rights of individual citizens than it specifically enacted"".

[page 710]

To overcome this Court's decision in Colet and the broad principle of
statutory interpretation it reflects, the appellants advanced several
arguments. I propose now to examine each of these in turn.

(C) The Appellants' Arguments

(1) Right of Entry Essential to Give Effect
to Parliament's Intent

The appellants submit that the authority to
intercept oral communications, as distinct from telecommunications, is
unworkable without the right to enter to install listening devices. Such a
power should therefore be implied.

There has been no material presented to this
Court to support the suggestion that oral communications cannot be effectively
intercepted without the power to trespass to install listening devices. Justice
MacDonald in Re Application for
Authorization to Intercept Private Communications, supra, at p. 46,
refused to ""accept as a fact that without trespassory entry almost all
electronic bugging would be impossible.... "" Mr. Justice Stevenson in the
Court of Appeal labelled this assertion, correctly in my respectful opinion,
""an appeal to convenience"" (at p. 633).

I also find the argument singularly
unpersuasive. Parliament intended oral communications, as well as
telecommunications, should be the proper subject of interception. That much is
made clear by the disjunctive definition of ""private communications""
in s. 178.1; in this regard, see Goldman
v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 976.

I am not convinced, however, that the
interception of oral communications contemplated by Part IV.1 cannot be
accomplished without a trespass. It may well be that, absent covert entry,
electronic bugging would be much more difficult, but it is not correct to say
that oral communications cannot be intercepted without a power of entry. See Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427
(1963), at pp. 467-68, per Brennan
J. dissenting.

[page 711]

If the police obtain
the cooperation of a person who does have a legal right of access to a place,
there is no need to commit a trespass to install a listening device. Unlawful
entry can also be avoided when oral communications are intercepted with the aid
of a person fitted with a body pack who enters a place with consent or by the
use of a long range parabolic microphone. It seems to me that there are many
occasions when oral communications can be effectively intercepted without a
power of entry.

The strongest
indication that Parliament considered a power of entry was not essential to
give effect to an authorization to intercept oral communications is the
omission of this power from the extremely detailed provisions of Part IV.1. The
fact that they could perhaps be intercepted more frequently and more
conveniently if there were such a power constitutes, in my view, scant
justification for inferring such a power.

(2) Legislative
Background

The appellants
invited the Court to look at the material which led up to the introduction of
the Protection of
Privacy Act in order to
determine the intention and objectives present to the minds of the legislators.
Particular reference was made to the report of the Canadian Committee on
Correction (the Ouimet Committee — 1969) as well as the minutes of the Standing
Committee of the House of Commons on Justice and Legal Affairs. In their view,
these materials made clear that Parliament was well aware of the fact that
surreptitious entry into private premises for the purpose of concealing
electronic listening devices was an integral part of electronic surveillance.

Several recent
judgments of this Court discuss the admissibility of extrinsic materials where
issues of statutory interpretation are raised: Re Residential Tenancies Act, 1979, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 714, at pp. 721-24; Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [19841 1 S.C.R. 357; Re: Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 297. It is clear from
these cases that extrinsic

[page 712]

 evidence is not
receivable as an aid to the construction of a statute. This is of course true
whether or not the case raises a constitutional issue. No direct assistance can
be derived, therefore, from the materials relied upon by the appellant in
deciding whether Parliament intended by necessary implication to authorize
entry.

In any event, I find
the committees' reports inconclusive. Nowhere can I find any substantial
support for the view that the proponents of the legislation intended implicitly
to endorse trespass in aid of authorized interceptions.

I conclude therefore
that the legislative background cannot be used as an aid to the construction of
Part IV.1 and that, in any event, it does not support the appellants' position.

(3)
Dalia v. United
States

Considerable
reliance was placed upon Dalia
v. United States, 441 U.S.
238 (1979), by the parties. Dalia involved
constitutional issues as well as questions of statutory interpretation; I shall
refer only to the latter which closely parallel the questions in the present
appeal.

Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  resembles Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. paras. 2510-2520. Like Part IV.1,
Title III does not expressly authorize covert entry to effect authorized
interceptions. The majority of the Supreme Court of the United States, per Powell J. (Burger C.J., White, Blackmun and
Rehnquist JJ. concurring), held that a power of entry was implicitly included.
Justices Stevens, Brennan and Marshall dissented, finding a covert entry to
install a bug to be unlawful under the statute. Justice Stewart, the ninth
member of the Court, disposed of the matter on constitutional grounds and
therefore did not reach the question of statutory construction.

[page 713]

Justice Powell, for
the majority, gave three reasons for his holding. His first argument was that
Congress had enacted a detailed scheme to authorize interception of private
communications, and there was nothing to suggest that authority was limited to cases in which covert entry
would not be required. The
same could be said about Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code . I agree, however, with the dissenting opinion of
Justice Stevens that this argument actually works the other way. Where a
legislative scheme speaks in considerable detail about most aspects of an
issue, but is silent on one aspect,
that silence is particularly telling. To imply permission from silence, in the
words of Stevens J. at p. 263, ""converts
silence into thunder"". Parliament's silence cannot be taken to sanction
what amounts to breaking and entering. The careful attempt in Part IV.1 of the Code to
circumscribe invasions of privacy cannot be seen as an indication of a
parliamentary intent to legalize break-ins.

Justice Powell's
second argument was that the legislative history of Title III confirmed that
Congress meant to authorize covert entries. The dissenting judges drew exactly
the opposite conclusion. I have already indicated why I do not consider the
legislative context in which Part IV.1 was enacted useful to the resolution of
this case.

Justice Powell
argued finally that a limitation having the effect of prohibiting covert entry
would thwart congressional intention because most bugging requires covert
entries. The difficulty with this argument is that it assumes what it is trying
to prove. If legislative intention is to enable interception of oral
communications by whatever means, prohibition of covert entry indeed thwarts
legislative intention. I am unwilling, however, to make the assumption this
argument requires. I have already
expressed my reasons for concluding that a right of entry is not necessary for the effective
operation of Part IV.1.

[page 714]

I agree with the point made in the dissenting
opinion of Justice Brennan in Dalia that
where private communications have been recorded subsequent to a trespass to
install a listening device two invasions of privacy have taken place. The
listening to the conversation breaches conversational privacy; the illegal
entry breaches physical privacy. A breach of conversational privacy, by itself,
is clearly approved of by Part IV.1, provided an authorization has been
obtained; a breach of physical privacy is not. I am not prepared to infer that
Parliament, by authorizing invasion of privacy in one form, has thereby
authorized invasion of privacy in another form.

I would note that scholarly comment on Dalia has been less than panegyrical:
Reddick and Westin, Covert Police
Break-Ins Create Conflict Among U.S. Circuit Courts, 30 Mercer L.
Rev. 707 (1979); Ruffley, Case Comment:
Dalia v. United States, 57 J. Urb. L. 588 (1980); Latta, No Requirement
of Prior Judicial Approval for Covert
Entry to Effect Electronic Surveillance—Dalia v. United States, 29 De
Paul L. Rev. 165 (1979); Oshinsky, Judicial
Interpretation of Title III—Should Privacy Interests Yield in the Wake of
Congressional Silence on Entries to Install Bugs?, 29 Cath. U.L. Rev. 697 (1980); Breaking and
Entering into Private Premises to Effect Electronic Surveillance: Dalia v.
United States, 39 Md. L. Rev. 754
(1980); Basik, Case comment:
Dalia v. United States, 9 Bait. L. Rev. 308 (1980); Cobb, Covert
Entry, Electronic Surveillance, and the Fourth Amendment: Dalia v. United
States, 40 La. L. Rev. 951 (1980);
McNulty, Dalia v. United States: The Validity of Covert Entry, 65 Iowa L. Rev. 931 (1980).

With the greatest respect, I would reject the
reasoning of the majority in Dalia.

(4) Section 25  of the Criminal Code 

The next submission made by the appellants is
that entry to effect an authorization to intercept oral communications is
allowed by s. 25(1)  of the Criminal Code . Under this view of the
matter, s.25(1) 

[page 715]

 permits
such entry because it is required to accomplish an authorized action of the
police.

Subsection
25(1)  provides:

25. (1) Every one who
is required or authorized by law to do
anything in the administration or enforcement of the law

(a) as a private person,

(b) as a peace officer or public officer,

(c) in aid of a peace officer or public
officer, or

(d) by virtue of his office,

is, if he acts on reasonable and probable
grounds, justified in doing what he is
required or authorized to do and in using as much force as is necessary
for that purpose.

The
Alberta Court of Appeal refused to give s. 25(1)  the breadth urged by the
appellants. Applying my reasoning in Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739, Justice Stevenson concluded
at p. 632 that s. 25(1)  "" ... affords a protection for required or
authorized acts and the use of force in respect thereof but it begs the
question here which is whether someone acting under an 'authorization' is
required or authorized by law to trespass.""

In Eccles, it was contended that s. 25(1)  of
the Criminal Code  authorized trespass by
the police in order to effect an arrest. I responded to this argument in the
following terms, at p. 742:

Section 25  does not have such amplitude. The
section merely affords justification to a person for doing what he is required or authorized by law to do in the
administration or enforcement of the law, if he acts on reasonable and probable grounds, and for using necessary
force for that purpose. The question which must be answered in this case, then, is whether the
respondents were required or
authorized by law to commit a trespass; and not, as their counsel contends, whether they were required
or authorized to make an arrest. If they were authorized by law to commit a
trespass, the authority for it must be found in the common law for there is
nothing in the Criminal Code . [Emphasis
added.]

[page 716]

I maintain this
view. Subsection 25(1)  does not augment the powers of the police beyond those
otherwise given to them by the Criminal Code or at
common law. Thus, it cannot accord a right of entry. Such a right must be found
in Part IV.1 or at common law. Subsection 25(1)  is of no assistance to the
appellants.

(5) The Common
Law Powers of the Police

It was argued that
the common law recognizes certain powers inherent in the execution of a police
officer's duty. These powers, it is urged, would permit the police to engage in
acts necessary to the fulfillment of their duty even though they involve an
otherwise unlawful interference with a person's liberty or property, Reliance
was placed upon Eccles
v. Bourque, supra, and
R. v. Waterfield, [1963] 3 All E.R. 659 (C.A.), as well as
R. v. Stenning, [1970] S.C.R. 631, and Knowlton v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 443.

If a general power
of entry existed at common law, it would still be necessary to examine whether
such a power could operate in the face of Parliament's failure to include it
expressly in the statutory scheme created to regulate the interception of
private communications.

I would emphasize
that the police have never been entitled to exercise a general right of entry
as part of the powers accorded them at common law. No authority cited to this
Court expressly recognizes such a right. The tenor of the cases the appellants
did raise in argument runs counter to the position advanced. Unless
specifically authorized by law, a police officer has no right to enter upon the
private property of another without consent.

The situations where
entry has been authorized are exceptional and few in number. The common law
always allowed a warrant to search for stolen goods to be granted by a
magistrate: see Chic Fashions (West Wales), Ltd. v. Jones, [1968] 1 All E.R. 229 (C.A.)
Another exception was recognized in Eccles
v. Bourque, supra. In that case,
the appellant had sued three members of the Vancouver

[page 717]

 Police Force for trespass alleged to have been
committed when they entered the appellant's apartment to apprehend a fugitive
for whom outstanding arrest warrants existed. The claim was denied by this
Court on the basis that the police were entitled, in limited circumstances, to
enter private property without consent to effect an arrest. I made the
following statement at p. 744:

I would wish to
make it clear, however, that there is no question of an unrestricted right to enter in
search of a fugitive. Entry can be made against the will of a
householder only if (a) there are reasonable and probable grounds for the
belief that the person sought is within the premises and (b) proper
announcement is made prior to entry.

The appellants, however, rely upon the following
emphasized lines from my reasons in the same case at p. 743:

But there are occasions when the interest
of a private individual in the security of
his house must yield to the public interest,
when the public at large has an interest in the process to be executed. The criminal is not immune from
arrest in his own home nor in the home of one of his friends. So it is
that in Semayne's Case a limitation was put on the
""castle"" concept....

As Ritchie J. recognized in Colet, it is quite clear when these
lines are read in context that they do not create a general right of entry on
the part of the police whenever it can be said that the public at large has an
interest in the process to be executed. The creation of so sweeping an
exception would quickly swallow up the general protection accorded a property
owner at common law from arbitrary invasion. Eccles v. Bourque, supra, creates a limited exception to that
general protection. So viewed, it is authority against the position advanced by
the appellants.

The Waterfield,
Stenning and Knowlton cases
all involved charges of assaulting or obstructing a police officer in the
execution of his duty. Charges were laid as a result of altercations with the
police and the defence was raised that the police were not acting in the
execution of their duty at the time.

[page 718]

The
Court of Appeal in Waterfield,
at p.
661, enunciated the following test for determining the limits of a policeman's
duty:

In the judgment
of this court it would be difficult, and in the present
case it is unnecessary, to reduce within specific limits the general terms in
which the duties of police constables have
been expressed. In most cases it is probably more convenient to consider
what the police constable was actually doing and in particular whether such
conduct was prima facie an unlawful interference with a person's liberty or
property. If so, it is then relevant to consider whether (a) such conduct
falls within the general scope of any
duty imposed by statute or
recognised at common law and (b) whether such conduct, albeit
within the general scope of such a duty, involved an unjustifiable use
of powers associated with the duty. Thus, while it is no doubt right
to say in general terms that police constables have a duty to prevent crime and
a duty, when crime is committed, to bring the offender to justice, it is also
clear from the decided cases that when the execution of these general duties
involves interference with the person or property of a private person, the
powers of constables are not unlimited. [My emphasis.]

R. v. Waterfield does not stand for the
proposition that a power of entry to private property for the purpose of
installing a listening device can arise simply by virtue of a policeman's
general duty to detect crime and enforce the law.

Furthermore,
the Waterfield test provides no
assistance when the police have trespassed to install a listening device. I
cannot accept that conduct of itself unlawful and initiated with full knowledge
of its potential illegality could ever fall within the general scope of a
policeman's duty. As Lord Edmund-Davies recognised in Morris v. Beardmore, supra, at p. 759:

My Lords, I have
respectfully to say that I regard it as unthinkable that a policeman may
properly be regarded as acting in the execution of his duty when he is acting
unlawfully, and this regardless of whether his contravention is of the criminal
law or simply of the civil law.

The
fact that police officers could be described as acting within the general scope
of their duties to

[page 719]

investigate crime
cannot empower them to violate the law whenever such conduct could be justified
by the public interest in law enforcement. Any such principle would be nothing
short of a fiat for illegality on the part of the police whenever the benefit
of police action appeared to outweigh the infringement of an individual's
rights. For the Waterfield
principle to apply, the
police must be engaged in lawful execution of their duty at the time of the
conduct in question.

(6) Section 26 of
the Interpretation
Act

The appellants argue
that s. 26(2) of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
I-23, grants an implied power of entry to a peace officer authorized to
intercept oral communications. Subsection 26(2) reads:

26. ...

(2) Where power is given to a person, officer
or functionary, to do or enforce the doing of any act or thing, all such powers shall be deemed to be also
given as are necessary to enable the person, officer or functionary to
do or enforce the doing of the act or thing.

The appellants argue
that a police officer is given the power under Part IV.1 to do a certain thing
(i.e. intercept oral communications), thus he is deemed by s. 26(2) to have the
power necessary to do that thing (i.e. to enter surreptitiously to install a
listening device). This proposition was rejected by Mr. Justice MacDonald as
well as by the Alberta Court of Appeal.

I cannot accept this
line of argument either. In Colet v. The Queen, supra, Ritchie J. held that any provision authorizing police officers to enter
private property must do so expressly and s. 26(2) of the Interpretation Act could not be considered as clothing
police officers with such authority. I respectfully agree that a general
deeming provision in the Interpretation
Act cannot supply the
authority for conduct that is otherwise unlawful.

[page 720]

As well, the argument that s. 26(2) supplies the
necessary authority to enter seems to me fundamentally to beg the question. The
very issue is whether Parliament has granted the ""power"" the
subsection refers to as a precondition to its operation. Furthermore, I do not
believe, for reasons already given, that a right of entry is ""necessary""
to permit the police to accomplish the interception of oral communications.

(D) Her Majesty The Queen v. Papalia

Subsequent to the hearing of this appeal, the
Ontario Court of Appeal rendered judgment in R. v. Papalia (1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 289. This case
raised in part the very issue presently under consideration. The case against
the accused depended upon evidence of electronically intercepted private
communications. The trial judge admitted evidence of private communications
intercepted on business premises and refused to admit evidence of private
communications intercepted in two automobiles and certain other derivative
evidence. The accused were acquitted and the Crown appealed. The issue on the
appeal was the admissibility of the electronically intercepted evidence under
s. 178.16(1) of Part IV.1.

Brooke J.A. (Arnup and Blair JJ.A. concurring)
concluded that the trial judge erred in refusing to admit the private
communications intercepted in the accused's automobile and the derivative
evidence. The Court of Appeal next considered the trial judge's decision to
admit the private communications intercepted in an office and boardroom located
on business premises of the accused. The listening devices were installed
following surreptitious entry to these premises on two occasions. The enabling
authorization under which the police officers acted specifically provided that
in intercepting private communications, the police officers were authorized
""for such purpose to enter such places as may be necessary in order to
install, monitor or remove"" any listening devices.

[page 721]

In the opinion of
Brooke J.A., the trial judge quite properly held the evidence admissible under
s. 178.16(1) on the basis of the decisions of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in
R. v. Doss, [1979] 4 W.W.R. 97, and the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Lyons (1982), 140 D.L.R. (3d) 223. Brooke J.A. went on to
review the Dass and Lyons decisions as well as the decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal in the
instant case and that of the United States Supreme Court in Dalia v. United States, supra. He concluded that the interceptions had
been lawfully made within the meaning of s. 178.16(1)(a).

In reaching this
conclusion, Brooke J.A. decided that an authorization carries with it, by
necessary implication, the authority to enter to install a listening device. In his opinion, almost
all instances of
wiretapping and electronic surveillance involved conduct in the nature of
trespass and this includes surreptitious or covert entry. He was persuaded that
Parliament recognized this when the legislation was passed and intended to deal
comprehensively with the problem in Part IV.1 of the Code. Thus, while a judge may specifically authorize
surreptitious entry or other conduct in the nature of a trespass, such express
authorization is unnecessary.

With respect, I cannot
agree. For the reasons already given, I am not persuaded Parliament intended by
its silence to authorize entry by the police to install a listening device. I
conclude therefore that the Ontario Court of Appeal erred in its decision on
this point.

(E) The Statutory
Scheme

I am fortified in my
conclusion that the authority to trespass in order to install a listening
device is not to be found either expressly or by implication in Part IV.1.
Section 178.16, which makes evidence of intercepted conversations prima facie inadmissible, is a logical corollary to s.
178.11(1), which makes it an offence to wilfully intercept a private
communication. Subsection 178.11(2) lists

[page 722]

the number of persons to whom s. 178.11(1) does
not apply, including a person who intercepts a private communication ""in
accordance with"" an authorization. The important point is that outside of
the specifically enumerated exceptions, everyone who willfully [sic] intercepts
a private conversation by means of a device is guilty of an indictable offence.
Parliament has taken great pains in Part IV.1 to lay down an elaborate code
legitimizing conduct otherwise criminal by the terms of s. 178.11(1).

As McIntyre J. recognized, in analyzing the
purpose of Part IV.1 in Goldman v. The
Queen, supra, at p. 994,
""the courts must be astute to limit breaches [of the right to privacy] to
the extent provided by the Code"". The notion of an ""implied""
right to enter private property does not sit easily with that language.

(F) Conclusion on Question # 1

In my view, the decision in Colet v. The Queen, supra, and the classic
principle of statutory interpretation it embodies, are in the end dispositive
of this case. The Court held in Colet, at p. 10, that ""... any provision
authorizing police officers to search and enter private property must be
phrased in express terms"". That reasoning seems to me to apply whether the
right of the police to enter private property is sought for the purpose of
intercepting private communications or seizing dangerous firearms. I am not at
all persuaded that Colet can be distinguished. The right of entry is claimed here for the
same purpose as it was in Colet:
to aid in the enforcement of the criminal law.
Equally, the same justification for inferring the right is advanced: the proper
and effective fulfillment of a judicially granted warrant. Ultimately, the
logic upon which Colet turns is the traditional legal protection accorded private property
and the long-standing refusal of the judiciary to impair that protection where
Parliament has not itself done so expressly.

[page 723]

It follows I would
answer the first question posed in the reference in the negative.

V The Power of
a Judge to Expressly Authorize Entry

The second question
posed is whether a judge may expressly grant a power to enter as a term of an
authorization to intercept oral communications. Paragraph 178.13(2)(d) of Part
IV.1 is relied upon in support of the argument that a judge possesses such
power. I set it out here again for convenience.

178.13

(2) An authorization shall

(d) contain such
terms and conditions as the judge considers advisable
in the public interest; and

The appellants argue
that a judge may grant a right of entry when the interception of oral
communications is authorized, whether or not Parliament intended by necessary
implication that such a power should exist. The majority of the Court of Appeal
concluded that s.178.13(2)(d) could only be construed as words of limitation
and could not therefore be read as authorizing a court to permit a trespass. Chief
Justice McGillivray and Justice Harradence dissented on this point. Each gave
separate reasons for his conclusion that a judge could grant the power to
trespass as one of the terms of an authorization.

Chief Justice
McGillivray held that a judge who grants an authorization has the power to
order that the electronic device may be placed by surreptitious entry or by
trick where the circumstances require such action. He distinguished this
Court's decision in Colet,
noting in particular
that the success of the police operation depends upon a listening device being
planted without the knowledge of the occupier, thus eliminating the element of
invasion and the possibility of confrontation that, in his opinion, concerned
the Court in Colet.

Furthermore, he considered
Parliament well aware that surreptitious entry into private premises

[page 724]

 for the purpose of concealing electronic
devices was often an integral part of electronic eavesdropping. Therefore, when
it allowed the practice of bugging to continue it implicitly intended to allow
surreptitious entry to continue to the extent authorized by the court. Entry to
install a listening device was similar to a policeman standing in a property
owner's flower bed listening at an open window. The serious invasion the
legislation contemplates is not the entry upon a person's property, but the
entry into his mind by intercepting private communication. Once such an
invasion is authorized, the means of accomplishing this invasion are merely
incidental. Thus, he concluded that an authorization does not carry with it the
implicit right of entry; however, a judge may spell out, in describing the
manner of interception, any right to enter or re-enter where the police request
such power and the judge deems it appropriate.

Harradence J.A. considered that a judge could
resort to the common law to permit a peace officer to gain entry to install a
listening device. He frankly noted that this step was an expansion of the
traditionally limited exceptions to a property owner's rights. Such a
judge-made adaptation of police power was justified, in his view, by the
serious challenge to our social order posed by modern day criminal activity. He
concluded, at p. 628:

I am of opinion that if a superior court
judge, on an application for an authorization made pursuant to Part IV.1 of the
Criminal Code , determines that the public weal can only be served by the
interception of private communications and
that effective interception of those communications can only be
obtained by placing a device on private property, then it is his duty to adapt the common law to meet modern conditions by
authorizing a surreptitious entry or
a suitable strategem to effect the installation of a device on that
property.

The power of a judge to grant a power to enter
as a term of an authorization has been considered in other cases as well. In R. v. Dass, supra, at p. 117, Huband J.A., in language obiter, but 'carefully

[page 725]

 chosen, dealt with
this issue in terms that I would, with respect, adopt:

As previously noted, the reference to the
installation of the authorization order is
not a fiat by the courts to violate the laws of the land. I see nothing
in the Criminal Code  which gives a judge the power to authorize or condone illegal entry. Crown counsel points to s.
178.13(2) (d), which appears to enable the judge to impose terms and
conditions which he considers advisable in
the public interest. In my view, that provision was not intended as a mechanism
to have the courts authorize illegal acts. The public interest is not
served by acts which violate the civil or
criminal laws of the land. The terms
and conditions could not validly include permission, directly or by implication, to ignore or breach such laws.

In R. v. Lyons, supra, Anderson J.A., dissenting in part,
applied Huband J.A.'s conclusion in the Dass case that an authorization does not give any authority to trespass and an
authorizing judge has no power to authorize or permit the police to act in such
an unlawful manner.

In R. v. Papalia, supra, the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded
that while a judge may include a right of entry as one of the terms of an
authorization, it was not necessary for him to do so; in the opinion of that
court, an authorization by necessary implication accords the police a right of
entry.

In R. v. Hardy (1984), 56 N.B.R. (2d) 417, 146 A.P.R. 417, the New Brunswick Court of Appeal considered whether the trial judge
erred in admitting into evidence private communications which were intercepted
by a room monitoring device surreptitiously placed in the accused's residence.
In that ease, the authorization given by the judge expressly permitted the
police ""where reasonably necessary to enter upon the premises in order to
install, monitor, remove, service, maintain any and all electromagnetic,
acoustic, mechanical or other device that may be required to implement this
authorization"".

[page 726]

The Court agreed that the intercepted private
communications were inadmissible. The Court was, however, divided upon the
power of the authorizing judge to grant a right of entry. Stratton J.A. (Hughes
C.J. concurring) applied the reasoning of Stevenson J.A. in this reference and
concluded that Part IV.1 does not allow a judge to authorize a trespass onto
private property for the purpose of installing a listening device. Angers J.A.
expressed his agreement with the dissenting reasons of Chief Justice
McGillivray. The wording of the authorization was, however, not sufficiently
clear to satisfy him that the judge who granted the order intended to authorize
the precise entry which was effected.

If Part IV.1 does not explicitly or implicitly
legalize a trespass to install a listening device, then as a corollary, there
can be no power in a judge to authorize such an illegality. A judge could never
possess the authority to grant the police powers which Parliament did not
intend them to be able to exercise. When acting pursuant to a statutory scheme,
a judge is limited by the authority granted him by the statute under which he
acts. Parliament has not expressly or by necessary implication, authorized a
right of entry. A negative response to the first question in this reference
compels a negative response to the second.

Before concluding, I would like to make a brief
comment upon Justice Harradence's reasoning that the common law, suitably
expanded, could provide the legal support for the judicial sanction of
surreptitious entry into private premises. With respect, I have the gravest
doubt whether it would ever be appropriate for a judge to look to the common law
for the right to authorize action by the police which the legislation itself
does not expressly or implicitly permit him to authorize; this is especially
true where the statutory scheme is an exhaustive and comprehensive expression
of legislative policy, like Part IV.1 of the Code. Where the judge must not only look outside the statutory
scheme for the right to act in the manner he proposes, but must
""adapt"" the common law to suit his purpose, it seems to me he crosses
the

[page 727]

boundary which separates
the judicial from the legislative function.

I would answer the
second question in the negative.

VI Conclusion

The right to be free
from unwanted intrusion is important and fundamental. It leaves no room for
casual inference of Parliamentary sanction of illegality. When Parliament
declines to sanction expressly what would otherwise be unlawful acts, we should
not assume that it has impliedly given such acts its imprimatur. Nor should we conclude that Parliament intended the
courts to fill a lacuna
legis by writing in
something which Parliament left out. I agree with the following observation of
Lord Scarman in Morris
v. Beardmore, supra, at
p. 763, which seems to me to reach the heart of the present appeal:

... it is not the task of judges, exercising
their ingenuity in the field of
implication, to go further in the invasion of fundamental private rights and liberties
than Parliament has expressly authorised.

If the police, in
order to carry out effectively their difficult and frequently dangerous tasks,
are required to break and enter private dwellings, that right should be sought
from Parliament in express terms, as an amendment to Part IV.1. It is for
Parliament, not the judiciary, still less the police themselves, to fill any
gap in the Criminal
Code .

Until such time as
Parliament speaks specifically on this matter, I am of the view that an
unlawful entry to install a listening device is an unauthorized and unjustified
use of police powers. If the authorization to intercept did purport to sanction
such an entry, the authorization would be invalid in that respect. Judges
simply do not have the power to permit anyone, even police officers, to commit
unlawful acts. It is therefore my conclusion that both questions posed in this
reference

[page 728]

must be answered in
the negative. I would answer them accordingly and dismiss this appeal.

The judgment of
Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

ESTEY J.—Because the answer to question 1 may
be affected by the content of the particular authorization, it is difficult to
answer the question in generality. The manner of interception may be expressed
in very specific terms in one order, whereas the court in another order may
authorize the use of several or all of the devices enumerated in Part IV.1, leaving
open to the investigative agency the choice between these devices, and the
choice between wiretapping with or without interference with equipment inside
the premises, or radio surveillance by electromagnetic devices, or a
combination of these and other devices. A different answer, for example, would
be required where the order specifically authorized the use of a
battery-powered radio transmitter. With that explanation, and for the reasons I
have given in Lyons v.
The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, I would answer the two questions
referred to the Court in the following manner:

Question 1: Yes, provided that such entry is
required to implement the particular authorization and provided that the
authorizing judge does not include in the authorization any limitations on or
prohibition of such entry.

Question 2: Yes, provided that such entry is
required to implement the particular authorization.

No question arose in
Lyons, supra, relating to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  or its application as the trial arose
before the Charter  became part of our Constitution. In
their presentation to this Court, the parties did not advance any submission to
the effect that the Charter
of Rights  had any
application in this appeal. Neither does it appear that any such presentation
was made in the Court of Appeal, although counsel were there

[page 729]

afforded an
opportunity to do so. I therefore have not addressed the relation of the Charter ,
if there be any, to the questions put to the Court of Appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law - Wiretaps - Admissibility of evi­dence -
Interceptions authorized by court - Installa­tion of device involving trespass
- Whether or not interceptions ""lawfully made"" - Whether or not evi­dence
obtained admissible - Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 25, 178.1,
178.11(1), 178.12(1), 178.13(1), (2)(d), 178.16(1).

Evidence - Admissibility - Wiretap evidence - Operation to
obtain evidence involving trespass - Whether or not evidence admissible.

Police officers, authorized to intercept appellants’
pri­vate communications, entered the residence of one of the appellants without
consent to install a room monitoring device. None of the authorizations made
reference to the manner of installing the device. Later, the appellants were
tried and convicted on a charge of conspiracy to import a narcotic.
Conversations intercepted by the monitoring device were introduced in evidence
at trial and held admissible. The Court of Appeal dismissed appellants’ appeals
but a dissenting judge concluded the evidence of the intercepted communications
inadmissible in that the trespass made the interceptions not ""lawfully
made"" within the meaning of s. 178.16(1) of the Crimi­nal
Code. The appeals were based on this dissenting judgment.

Held (Dickson and Chouinard JJ. dissenting):
The appeals should be dismissed.

Per Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ.: Part
IV.1 of the Criminal Code , when read as a whole, clearly contemplates,
requires and authorizes, by necessary implication and unavoidable inference,
the placing of a radio device on the premises where the intercept is to be
made, where the use of radio equipment is authorized for the interception of a
private communication. Modern

[Page 634]

surveillance techniques involve the invasion of
property by directed energy to extract private communications and no express
authorization for such ""entry"" on the target premises is found in
Part IV.1. Parliament should not be taken to have authorized the use of
procedures and equipment without, at the same time, supplying the public
officers undertaking these duties with the appro­priate means and authority to
carry them out.

The process of interception is a single undertaking
carried out on authorization orders of the court and cannot be segmented into
legally consequential and legally inconsequential steps. The evidence cannot be
considered admissible on the one hand, and an attendant trespass, on the other,
be left to be dealt with in later proceedings.

Parliament has broadly empowered the courts to
authorize the use of devices to intercept designated communications. Since many
of the devices allowed by the Code could not otherwise function as
interception ""devices"", Parliament cast the section broadly so as to
empower the court in its discretion to authorize the placing of a
""device"" inside the premises designated in the authorization, whether
or not a trespass might occur and whether or not the owner of the premises was
the person whose communications were to be intercepted. Parliament, however,
foresaw the differences in the magnitude in the potential seriousness presented
by the several interception procedures that Part IV.1 allows the court to
authorize. Section 178.13(2)(d), therefore, by requiring the authorizing judge
to include in the author­ization ""such terms and conditions as the judge
consid­ers advisable in the public interest"", creates a judicial safeguard
to balance the bilateral nature of Part IV.1-the shield from, and yet the
instrument permitting, invasions of privacy. The authorization granted here was
sufficiently broad to empower the law enforcement offi­cers both to plant and
to service the device, even when both activities involved a physical entry into
the targeted premises.

lnterceptions, if ""lawfully made"", can be
admitted in evidence. The term, however, given its presence in Part IV.1 (a
mini-Code within the codified criminal law) must be interpreted to mean in
accordance with Part IV.1, as opposed to in conformity with all laws. Logical
impossibilities result if ""unlawful"" is taken to refer to Criminal
Code  sections not in Part IV.1, let alone to all other laws. lt was
unreasonable to read s. 178.16  as rendering interceptions inadmissible because
external procedures used in the operation entailed entry which

[Page 635]

may have amounted to trespass. The physical entry
here did not amount to a breach of Part lV.1, and in particu­lar, to a breach
of s. 178.11. Indeed, once Parliament has granted the power to authorize and
once that power has been exercised, the authorized conduct in law would no
longer amount to trespass.

Per Dickson and Chouinard JJ., dissenting:
A private communication that has been intercepted by means of any form of
electronic surveillance is inadmissible pursuant to s. 178.16(1) of the Code
unless the interception was ""lawfully made"".
Thus, for the purposes of Part IV.1, the manner in which the evidence has been
obtained is determinative of its admissibility.

An authorization to intercept private communications
granted pursuant to Part IV.1 does not implicitly carry with it a right of
entry to private premises and a judge does not possess any authority to include
a right of entry as a term of an authorization pursuant to s. 178.13(2). The
entries made by police to install and maintain the listening device for the
purpose of intercepting the pri­vate communications in question were
unauthorized and unlawful.

An interception of private communications accom­plished
by means of an illegal entry to private premises is not ""lawfully
made"" within the meaning of s. 178.16(1)(a). Parliament intended any
breach of the right of privacy protected by Part IV.1 should be lawful in the
widest sense. There is no justification for limiting the terms of s.
178.16(1)(a) to lawfulness in obtaining the authorization or in listening to
and recording the conversation. The whole process of interception includ­ing
the installation of the listening device, must be lawful.

As a result of the two covert entries, the
interceptions of conversations were not ""lawfully made"" within the
meaning of s. 178.16(1)(a) and therefore ought not to have been admitted as
evidence. It follows that, as the appellants were convicted on the basis of
inadmissible evidence, the appeals should be allowed and new trials directed.

The reasons of Dickson and Chouinard JJ. were delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)-The question is whether the trial
judge erred in admitting into evidence certain private communications
intercepted through the use of a room monitoring device installed
surreptitiously by police officers in the

[Page 637]

home of the appellant, Kristine Lyons. The case raises, in part,
the very important issues presented in the Reference Pursuant to Section
27(1) of the Judicature Act, Chapter J-1 of the Revised Stat­utes of Alberta,
1980, as amended, referred by Order in Council (O.C. 84/83) of the Lieutenant
Governor in Council dated the 2nd day of Febru­ary, A.D. 1983, to the Court of
Appeal of Alberta, [1984] 2 S.R.C. 697 (hereinafter the Wiretap
Reference). Judgment in the instant case was delayed pending hearing of
argument upon, and determination of, the Wiretap Reference. As well,
this Court has considered judgments delivered subsequently in two provincial
appellate courts relevant to the Wiretap Reference and the present
appeals. Judgment in the Wiretap Reference is being delivered
concurrently herewith.

I The Facts

Police obtained a series of authorizations and renewals to
intercept private communications of the appellants and other persons at, among
other places, Kristine Lyons’ home, 1207 Nanton Avenue, Vancouver, British
Columbia. The authorizations and renewals collectively covered the period
between August 25, 1977 and February 13, 1978. All of the authorizations
contained the following stipulation:

The type of private communications that may be inter­cepted
are all telecommunications and oral communica­tions.

None of the authorizations made reference to the manner of
installing the listening device. Accord­ingly, none purported to expressly
authorize trespass.

On November 2, 1977 four police officers, with-out consent,
entered the residence at 1207 Nanton Avenue to install a room monitoring
device. They were there about two hours. The transmitter oper­ated continuously
thereafter, and was capable of intercepting not only telephone communications,
but also all conversations within the room. Not all conversations were recorded
by the police. On December 19, 1977, three police officers, without consent,
again entered 1207 Nanton Avenue, to

[Page 638]

change the batteries in the monitoring device. They stayed for
about an hour.

The appellants and one David Fladgate were tried and convicted
before His Honour Judge Fisher on a charge of conspiracy to import a narcotic
(cocaine). At trial, evidence was intro­duced of ten conversations intercepted
between November 6, 1977 and December 30, 1977 by the above-mentioned
monitoring device.

lI The Court of Appeal Decision

The accused appealed their convictions to the British Columbia
Court of Appeal on several grounds. The appeals of Lyons, Prevedoros and
McGuire were dismissed. The Court was unani­mous on all but one of the grounds.
The point of disagreement concerned the issue of whether the trespass to
install the room monitoring device ren­dered the intercepted private
communications inadmissible in evidence.

Hinkson J.A., Macdonald J.A. concurring, wrote for the majority.
He said the trespass did not vitiate the authorization. While any wrongful acts
committed in the carrying out of the authorization could be the subject of
criminal or civil proceedings, such wrongful acts did not affect the admissi­bility
of the evidence of private communications.

Anderson J.A. dissented on this point. He con­cluded that
authorizations to intercept private communications could not and did not
authorize a trespass. He also held that the installation of the monitoring
device was part of the interception. An unlawful trespass made the interception
not ""law-fully made"" and this, by virtue of s. 178.16(1)  of the Criminal
Code , rendered the evidence of the private communications inadmissible.
Anderson J.A. would have ordered a new trial. The case reaches this Court by
virtue of Anderson J.A.’s dissent on a point of law (s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code ).

[Page 639]

III The Questions At Issue

The trial in this case arose prior to the procla­mation of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Therefore, the case raises only ques­tions
of statutory interpretation. The reach of Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code , bearing
the rubric ""Invasion of Privacy"", is at issue.

The majority of the Court of Appeal held that surreptitious entry
to install the listening device did not vitiate the authorization to intercept
com­munications at 1207 Nanton Avenue. Assuming this conclusion to be correct,
it does nothing to resolve the question of the admissibility of the evidence
garnered as a result of this electronic interception.

In considering the admissibility of evidence of private
communications, the starting point is s. 178.16(1)  of the Criminal Code :

178.16 (1) A private communication that has been intercepted
is inadmissible as evidence against the originator of the communication
or the person intended by the originator to receive it unless

a) the interception was lawfully made; or

b) the originator thereof or the person intended by the
originator to receive it has expressly consented to the admission thereof;

but evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of
information acquired by interception of a private com­munication is not
inadmissible by reason only that the private communication is itself
inadmissible as evidence. [Emphasis added.]

For the reasons I have already given in the Wiretap Reference,
it is my view that Parliament did not intend in Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code  to authorize the police to trespass to install a listening device.
Accordingly, an authorization does not implicitly carry with it a right of
entry to private premises. And equally, a judge does not possess any authority
to include a right of entry as a term of an authorization pursuant to s.
178.13(2) .

No express authority to trespass to install the listening device
was even purportedly granted in the authorization and renewals obtained by the
police in this case. Since the authorizations do not

[Page 640]

implicitly permit the police to enter a place where they propose
to intercept oral communications, it follows that the two trespasses involving
1207 Nanton Avenue were not lawful.

The question to be resolved is whether the inter­ceptions of
private communications, accomplished by means of the illegal entry to install
the listening device, were ""lawfully made"" within the meaning of s. 178.16(1) 
and hence admissible in evidence.

IV Admissibility of the Intercepted Conversations

ln R. v. Wray, [1971] S.C.R. 272, the majority of
this Court held that the criterion for determin­ing the admissibility of
evidence was its relevance, not the manner in which it was obtained. Thus,
according to the majority, the fact that evidence had been unlawfully obtained
did not affect admissibility unless the evidence was highly pre-judicial and of
trifling weight. If the Wray rule were to apply, the conclusion that the
trespass to install the listening device was unlawful would not affect the
admissibility of the intercepted private communications.

It may be that s. 24(2)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  will now modify the rule in Wray. I make no comment one way
or the other on that possibility. It cannot assist the appellants in the
present case. Quite aside from the Charter , however, it is clear that
Parliament has explicitly set aside the Wray rule in the context of
electronic surveillance by enacting s. 178.16(1) (a) which, it will be recalled,
makes a private conversation that has been intercepted inadmissible
unless the inter­ception was lawfully made. For purposes of Part IV.1,
therefore, not only is the manner in which evidence has been obtained relevant
for its admis­sibility, legality has become the sine qua non for
admissibility.

This Court has previously recognized in R. v. Commisso, [1983]
2 S.C.R. 121, that Parliament has enacted in s. 178.16 an exclusionary
rule which is an exception to the general rule that

[Page 641]

unlawfully obtained evidence is nevertheless ad­missible. The
issue in that case, simply put, was whether an authorization to intercept
private com­munications in respect of one offence was suffi­cient to render
lawful interceptions in respect of a different offence. The majority, speaking
through Lamer J., concluded it was; I wrote dissenting reasons for the minority
concluding it was not.

Of importance for the resolution of this case is the unanimous
agreement of the Court that only those private communications which have been
lawfully obtained may be admitted in evidence. Lamer J. recognized the
important concern for individual privacy that moved Parliament to enact s.
178.16, at p. 125:

In order to discourage unlawful invasions of the priva­cy of
citizens, Parliament not only made it an indictable offence but also enacted an
exclusionary rule which is an exception to the general rule that unlawfully
obtained evidence is nevertheless admissible.

To much the same effect, I wrote, at p. 134:

The unique legislative treatment of electronic surveillance
is a reflection of its nature. The modern technolo­gy is both powerful and
unobtrusive. The technology permits massive invasion of the privacy with ease.
It is also indiscriminate about the content of any communi­cation intercepted.
Parliament has determined that this potential constitutes a threat to
individual freedom and the right to privacy. The evidentiary rule of exclusion
fortifies the stipulation that interceptions of private communications are
illegal unless specified conditions are met.

In R. v. Dass, [1979] 4 W.W.R. 97 (Man.C.A.),
Huband J.A. took another view of this requirement of legality. Although holding
that Part IV.1 did not authorize a trespass, he concluded that evidence
obtained thereby was admissible. The essence of his reasoning appears at pp.
115-16:

The fact that there has been a trespass or some other civil
or, indeed, criminal wrong in the planting of the device does not invalidate
the authorization to intercept, and thus does not render the interception
unlawful. The authorization granted by the court is an authorization to

[Page 642]

intercept private communications. How that authoriza­tion is
carried out is not germane to the issue of the admissibility of the evidence
flowing from the intercep­tion. If a trespass has been committed, then those
who have committed the trespass will be answerable in some other criminal or
civil forum.

... if a trespass is committed the evidence thus obtained will
be admissible (subject to the usual rules governing admissibility), since it
was obtained pursuant to an authorization and thus falls under the second of
the four exceptions to the general prohibition against intercep­tions contained
ins. 178.11(2).

The installation of the device is not part of the intercep­tion.
If the installation is unlawful, in that there has been a contravention of
civil or criminal law in the placement of the device, the lawfulness of the
intercep­tion is not affected.

With respect, I cannot agree. In my view Huband J.A.’s
conclusions, which were applied by the majority of the Court of Appeal in this
case, conflict both with the express language of Part IV.l and with the
statutory scheme thereby enacted.

As mentioned earlier, it may well be true, as Huband J.A.
asserts, that a trespass in planting the listening device does not invalidate
the authori­zation to intercept. At most, however, this would allow the person
making the interception to avail himself of s. 178.11(2) in order to avoid
criminal liability for what would otherwise be an indictable offence under s.
178.11(1). With respect, this does not however lead to the conclusion
that the inter­ception was therefore rendered lawful. I see no reason in the
language or in the purpose of Part 1V.I to read the provision in s.
178.16(1) (a) that an interception must be ""lawfully made"" as
refer-ring only to lawfulness in obtaining the authoriza­tion. On the contrary,
in view of the fact that such evidence is prima facie inadmissible and
that the subsection is to be found in the context of a meticulously articulated
set of provisions permitting only a limited breach of the individual’s right of
privacy, these words should be given their full and literal meaning.

[Page 643]

It seems manifest to me that Parliament intended any breach of
the right of privacy, protected by Part IV.1, be lawful in the widest sense. In
my view, absent a valid consent, the surreptitious physical invasion of a home
when undertaken by police for the purposes of installing, maintaining,
repairing, or removing room monitoring devices renders any private
communication that has been intercepted not ""lawfully made"", within
the mean­ing of s. 178.16(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

In my opinion, it is not possible to separate the installation of
the listening device from the process of listening to and recording
conversations, so as to include only the latter in the process of intercep­tion.
This is an artificial and unrealistic distinc­tion. That interception must go
beyond mere lis­tening and recording not only conforms with common sense, it is
a necessary consequence of the wording of s. 178.16(l). The section demands
that the interception be lawfully made. It is the whole process of
interception which is referred to and that must therefore be lawful.
Installation is indis­pensible to interception. It must on any reasonable
reading be part of the making of an interception. An interception
accomplished by means of an unlawful entry cannot have been ""lawfully
made"".

The New Brunswick Court of Appeal has recently reached the same
conclusion on the admissibility of any private communication obtained as a
result of an illegal entry: R. v. Hardy (1984), 56 N.B.R. (2d) 417, 146
A.P.R. 417. In Hardy, the authorization given by the judge expressly
permitted the police to enter the Hardy residence ""where reasonably
necessary"" for the interception of oral communications. The police had
surreptitiously entered and planted a room-monitoring device which allowed them
to intercept the private communications in issue.

Stratton J.A. (Hughes C.J. concurring), decided that Part IV.1 of
the Code did not give any express authority to a judge to authorize a
trespass onto private property for the purpose of installing lis­tening
devices, nor could such authority be

[Page 644]

implied. He concluded the illegal entry of the law enforcement
officers into the Hardy residence ren­dered the intercepted private
communications inadmissible.

In reaching-this conclusion, he made the follow­ing comment,
upon the case at bar and the Dass case, with which I am in respectful
agreement:

As I read these decisions, they seem to turn on a narrow
interpretation of the word ""interception"" so that the conduct of the
police in installing monitoring devices is not part of the interception. I have
difficulty in agreeing with the interpretation that ""interception""
does not include the method of its execution. Rather, I would respectfully
adopt the dissenting view of Anderson, J.A. in the Lyons case that the
""interception"" of a private communication includes not merely the
listening to or recording of a private communication but also the means used to
acquire the private communication.

Angers J.A., in separate reasons, decided that it lay within the
power of a judge acting under s. 178.13 to authorize entry, however, the
particular wording of the authorization was not sufficiently clear to satisfy
him that the entry the police had actually made was authorized by the order
grant-ed. He agreed that the interception was not lawful­ly made and the evidence
was inadmissible.

In R. v. Papalia (1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 289, the
Ontario Court of Appeal did not need to decide the question of whether an
unlawful interception renders the private communication so obtained
inadmissible. The unanimous Court held that an authorization, by necessary
implication, carries with it the power to trespass to install a listening
device and therefore the interceptions in issue were lawfully made. It is
notable, however, that Brooke J.A. agreed with the conclusion of Anderson J.A. in
the instant case, that the installation of the listening device is part of the
interception process.

[Page 645]

V Conclusion

I conclude that, as a result of the two covert entries, the
interceptions of conversations at 1207 Nanton Avenue were not ""lawfully
made"" within the meaning of s. 178.16(1) (a) and ought there-fore not to
have been admitted as evidence. It follows that the appellants were convicted
on the basis of inadmissible evidence and I would accord­ingly allow the
appeals and direct new trials for each of the appellants.

The judgment of Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ. was
delivered by

ESTEY J.-The appellants were convicted on a charge of conspiring
to import cocaine into Canada contrary to s. 423(1) (d) of the Criminal Code 
of Canada. The issue raised in this appeal turns on the admission into
evidence of intercep­tions made pursuant to an authorization granted under s. 178.13 
of the Criminal Code . The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
need not be addressed as the trial in this case arose prior to its
proclamation. The interception evidence was obtained pursuant to an
authorization issued by Bouck J. on August 25, 1977 and pursuant to a
subsequent authorization issued by Toy J. on December 16, 1977. The appeal
proceeded in the Court of Appeal and in this Court on the basis of an agreed
statement of facts in which the following salient facts are set forth:

On November 2, 1977, police officers entered the residence
of the Appellant LYONS (which was also, on occasion, that of the Appellant PREVEDOROS),
at 1207 Nanton Avenue, in the City of Vancouver, for the purpose of installing
a device which would permit them to monitor and record oral communications
taking place within the premises.

On December 19, 1977, police officers entered 1207 Nanton
Avenue for the purpose of replacing the batter­ies powering the transmitter and
also to look for a place to install another such device.

The police had not obtained permission of anyone connected
with 1207 Nanton Avenue to enter that residence

[Page 646]

on November 2 and December 19, 1977. They relied solely on
the Authorizations and Renewals which they had obtained.

The regularity in substance and in form of the authorizing orders
is not under challenge. The sole issue arising is whether or not the entry into
the premises of the accused Lyons for the purpose of installing a radio
transmitter and subsequently to renew its batteries rendered inadmissible
evidence of the interceptions subsequently made pursuant to these
authorizations.

The authorization of August 25, after setting out the offences in
respect of which private com­munications may be intercepted, provided:

b) The type of private communications that may be
intercepted are all telecommunications and oral communications.

c) The identities of the known persons whose private
communications may be intercepted are,

(i) Kristine LYONS 1207 Nanton Avenue Vancouver, British
Columbia

The order then continued:

d) The private communications of persons whose iden­tities
are not known as of the date hereof which may be intercepted are,

those persons who resort to or use the premises described in
sub-paragraph (c) hereof, or

those persons who are in communication with the persons
described in sub-paragraph (c) hereof apparently with respect to an offence
mentioned in paragraph (a) hereof

which private communications may be intercepted at any of
the premises hereinbefore described and any place or premises in the Province
of British Columbia resorted to or used by the persons described in
sub-paragraph (c) hereof and in respect of any place of which a general
description cannot be given the manner of interception that may be used is
interception by means of any electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other
device. The private communications of such per-sons as described whose
identities are unknown at the date hereof may be intercepted during the period
for which this authorization is valid notwithstanding that during such period
their identities may become known.

[Page 647]

It will be noted that in subparagraph (d) the order provided that
"" …. the manner of interception that may be used is interception by means
of any electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device"". The order
of Toy J. also authorized the interception of the private communications of the
appellant Lyons as well as the appellants Pre­vedoros and McGuire. This order
differs somewhat from the first authorization in matters not conse­quential to
these proceedings.

The trial judge admitted ten interceptions made with respect to
the appellants and others from November 6, 1977 to December 30, 1977.

The majority of the Court of Appeal [(1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 318]
speaking through Hinkson J.A., after reviewing the judgment of this Court in Goldman
v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 976, concluded at p. 328 that "" …. even
where the police have committed a trespass to install a room-monitoring device,
…. the evidence is admissible"". The majority also concluded at p. 329:

When in the course of doing so the police commit acts which
amount to wrongful acts, such acts may give rise to civil or criminal
proceedings against them. But such acts do not vitiate the court order
authorizing the inter­cept. Therefore the evidence is admissible pursuant to s.
178.16(1) of the Code.

Anderson J.A. dissented for the reason that an interception
pursuant to an authorization is only admissible as evidence if it is
""lawfully made"" in the words of s. 178.16(1) (a), infra, of the
Criminal Code  and that such is not the case where the
interception results from trespass.

In my opinion, an ""interception"" is only
""lawfully made"" if it is made in accordance with the authorization
granted. The ""interception"" of a ""private communica­tion"" is
not merely ""listening to or recording a private communication"" but
includes the means used to ""acquire"" the ""private
communication""... .

Furthermore, Anderson J.A. was of the view that the authorizing
court had no power to authorize

[Page 648]

the police to act in an unlawful manner and conse­quently,
whether or not the order expressly author­ized or implicitly permitted
trespass, the result is the same: the evidence obtained by the intercep­tion is
inadmissible. In part this conclusion was reached by interpreting the words
""manner of interception"" as they are found in s.
178.13(2)(c) to mean ""a lawful manner of interception"". The position
in dissent is succinctly stated, at p. 348:

In summary, I would hold as follows:

(I) Private communications are not admissible unless
""the interceptions were lawfully made"", namely, in accordance with
the authorizations granted.

(2) The ""interception"" process includes the mode
of execution or procedure set out in the authorization including the
installation and maintenance of moni­toring devices.

(3) A police officer does not act in accordance with an
authorization when he carries out the instructions of the authorizing judge in
an unlawful manner, namely, by unlawfully trespassing to install and maintain
the monitoring devices.

The determination of the issue raised in this appeal depends upon
the construction placed upon Part IV.I, particularly ss. 178.l , 178.11 , 178.12 ,
178.13  and 178.16  of the Criminal Code . These provisions are as follows:

178.1 In this Part,

""authorization"" means an authorization to
intercept a private communication given under section 178.13  or subsection
178.15(2) ;

""intercept"" includes listen to, record or acquire
a communication or acquire the substance, meaning or purport thereof;

""private communication"" means any oral communica­tion
or any telecommunication made under circum­stances in which it is reasonable
for the originator thereof to expect that it will not be intercepted by any
person other than the person intended by the originator thereof to receive it;

[Page 649]

178.11 (1) Every one who, by means of an elec­tromagnetic,
acoustic, mechanical or other device, wilfully intercepts a private
communication is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to impris­onment
for five years.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to

(a) a person who has the consent to intercept,
express or implied, of the originator of the pri­vate communication or of the
person intended by the originator thereof to receive it;

(b) a person who intercepts a private communica­tion in
accordance with an authorization or any person who in good faith aids in any
way a person whom he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe is acting
with any such authorization;

(c) a person engaged in providing a telephone, telegraph or
other communication service to the public who intercepts a private
communication,

(i) if such interception is necessary for the purpose of
providing such service,

(ii) in the course of service observing or random monitoring
necessary for the purpose of mechanical or service quality control checks, or

(iii) if such interception is necessary to protect the
person’s rights or property directly related to providing such service; or

(d) an officer or servant of Her Majesty in right of Canada
in respect of a private communication intercepted by him in the course of
random moni­toring that is necessarily incidental to radio fre­quency spectrum
management in Canada.

178.12 (1) An application for an authorization shall be made
ex parte and in writing to a judge of a superior court of criminal
jurisdiction, or a judge as defined in section 482 and shall be signed by the
Attorney General of the province in which the application is made or the
Solicitor General of Canada or an agent ….

(b) the Attorney General of a province personal­ly, in
respect of any other offence in that province,

[Page 650]

and shall be accompanied by an affidavit which may be sworn
on the information and belief of a peace officer or public officer deposing to
the following matters, namely:

c) the facts relied upon to justify the belief that an
authorization should be given together with particulars of the offence;

d) the type of private communication proposed to be
intercepted;

e) the names, addresses and occupations, if known, of all
persons, the interception of whose private communications there are reasonable
and probable grounds to believe may assist the inves­tigation of the offence, a
general description of the nature and location of the place, if known, at which
private communications are proposed to be intercepted and a general description
of the manner of interception proposed to be used;

178.13… .

(2) An authorization shall

(a) state the offence in respect of which private
communications may be intercepted;

(b) state the type of private communication that may be
intercepted;

(c)state the identity of the persons, if known, whose
private communications are to be inter­cepted, generally describe the place at
which private communications may be intercepted, if a general description of
that place can be given, and generally describe the manner of interception that
may be used;

(d) contain such terms and conditions as the judge considers
advisable in the public interest; and

(e) be valid for the period, not exceeding sixty days, set
forth therein.

178.16 (1) A private communication that has been intercepted
is inadmissible as evidence against the originator of the communication or the
person intended by the originator to receive it unless

(a) the interception was lawfully made; or

(b) the originator thereof or the person intended by the
originator to receive it has expressly con­sented to the admission thereof;

[Page 651]

but evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of
information acquired by interception of a private communication is not
inadmissible by reason only that the private communication is itself
inadmissible as evidence.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the judge or magistrate
presiding at any proceedings may refuse to admit evidence obtained directly or
indirectly as a result of information acquired by interception of a private
communication that is itself inadmissible as evidence where he is of the
opinion that the admis­sion thereof would bring the administration of jus­tice
into disrepute.

(3) Where the judge or magistrate presiding at any
proceedings is of the opinion that a private communication that, by virtue of
subsection (1), is inadmissible as evidence in the proceedings

(a) is relevant to a matter at issue in the proceedings, and

(b) is inadmissible as evidence therein by reason only of a
defect of form or an irregularity in procedure, not being a substantive defect
or irregularity, in the application for or the giving of the authorization
under which such private com­munication was intercepted,

he may, notwithstanding subsection (1), admit such private
communication as evidence in the proceedings.

Part IV.1 was introduced into the Criminal Code  by
1973-74 (Can.), c. 50. There were sub­stantial amendments enacted in 1976-77
(Can.), c. 53. That which concerns this appeal is the amendment to
s. 178.13(2) , supra, which prior to 1977 read:

178.13.. .

(2) An authorization shall

…

(c) state the identity of the persons, if known, whose
private communications are to be inter­cepted and where the identity of such
persons is not known, generally describe the place at which private
communications may be intercepted or, if a general description of that place
cannot be given, generally describe the manner of intercep­tion that may be
used;

It will be seen that prior to the amendment, it was only
necessary to describe the place where the

[Page 652]

interception was to be undertaken where the iden­tity of the
persons whose private communications were to be intercepted was unknown. More
impor­tantly, it was only necessary to generally describe the manner of
interception when the place of interception could not be given. Under the
present form of the subsection, all this information must be given and the
obligation to advise as to the manner of interception is not conditional upon
any other knowledge or information in the possession of the person seeking the
authorization. This would appear to reveal a much more specific legis­lative
intent with reference to the breadth of au­thority assigned by Parliament to
the court in granting interception authorizations, and a com­mensurate
entitlement in and a burden on the court to know the scope of investigation to
be authorized.

The plan of Part IV.1, the ""Invasion of Privacy""
provisions of the Criminal Code , is directed both to protecting, and to
invading, the privacy of the individual. The very presence of Part IV.1 in the Code
is a recognition of these opposing needs in relation to criminal law which,
of course, falls exclusively in the domain of Parliament under s. 91(27) of the
Constitution Act. By the 1973-74 enactment of Part IV.l, Parliament
extended to the Criminal Code  some provisions with reference to
interception of communications which thereto-fore were found in part in the Radio
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. R-1, and these coupled with extensive provisions which
take a much broader approach to the matter of privacy form a mini-Code, Part
IV.1, under the heading ""Invasion of Privacy"".

Much has been written about the proper con­struction and
application of Part IV.l of the Code. lt is unnecessary to review the
ground covered by this Court in Goldman, supra, and by the Ontario Court
of Appeal in R. v. LeSarge (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 388, and R. v.
Welsh and lannuzzi (No. 6) (1977), 15 O.R. (2d) l, 32 C.C.C. (2d) 363, 74
D.L.R. (3d) 748. The very issue facing the Court in this appeal arose in the
Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Dass, [1979] 4 W.W.R. 97 where that
Court concluded (per Huband J.A., at p. 115):

[Page 653]

The fact that there has been a trespass or some other civil or,
indeed, criminal wrong in the planting of the device does not invalidate the
authorization to intercept, and thus does not render the interception unlawful.
The authorization granted by the court is an authorization to intercept private
communications. How that authoriza­tion is carried out is not germane to the
issue of the admissibility of the evidence flowing from the intercep­tion. If a
trespass has been committed, then those who have committed the trespass will be
answerable in some other criminal or civil forum.

With respect, I do not accept the reasoning which leads to this
conclusion. The process of intercep­tion is a single undertaking carried out
under the authorization orders of the court and cannot be segmented into
legally consequential and legally inconsequential steps. The interception must
be carried out in conformity with the Code and the orders issued
thereunder in order to qualify the material received on interception for
admission as evidence. The evidence in issue here may therefore be admissible
under the provisions of s. 178.16  if the Court is empowered, expressly or by
necessary implication, to authorize the placing of the trans­mitting device by
entry into these private premises and if the authorization here expressly or by
neces­sary implication grants authority so to do. Neither Part IV.1 nor the
orders herein issued expressly authorize entry by the officers into the
premises mentioned in the order for the installation of the radio device. The
question therefore reduces itself to this: can the terms of Part IV.1 and the
authori­zations be properly construed as permitting the installation of this
radio device in the manner outlined above? Presuming the implied authority can
properly be found in the sections of the Code and the court orders, the
evidence would be admissible.

For convenience I repeat the definition of ""pri­vate
communication"" in s. 178.1 of the Code:

""private communication"" means any oral communica­tion
or any telecommunication made under circum­stances in which it is reasonable
for the originator thereof to expect that it will not be intercepted by any

[Page 654]

person other than the person intended by the origina­tor
thereof to receive it.

That definition includes the word ""telecommunica­tion""
which in turn is defined in the Radio Act, supra, s. 2, the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, s. 28, the Canadian Radio-television
and Telecommunications Commission Act, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 49, s. 2 as:

""telecommunication"" means any transmission,
emission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images or sounds or
intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, visual or other electromagnetic
system.

In s. 287(2) of the Criminal Code  the words ""by
wire"" are omitted. The offence of interception of a private communication
refers to interception ""by means of an electromagnetic, acoustic,
mechanical or other device"". The expression ""electromagnetic,
acoustic, mechanical or other device"" was in turn defined in s. 178.1  as:

""electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other
device"" means any device or apparatus that is used or is capable of being
used to intercept a private communi­cation....

The definition of ""telecommunication"" refers to the
"" . . . reception of . . . sounds . . . by . . . radio, visual or other
electromagnetic system"".

It was not argued that the transmitter planted by the police in
the premises of the appellant Lyons was not ""an electromagnetic ...
device"". It was also not challenged that the operation of the device
produced a transcript of a ""private com­munication"".
It is also either agreed or not contested that the authorizations complied with
paras. (a) and (b) of s. 178.13(2); and that each order authorized the
""interception by means of any elec­tromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or
other device"".

This then brings one to s. 178.16  to determine whether or not the
intercepted private communica­tion is admissible as evidence ""against the
origina­tor of the communication"". Admissibility only
results if:

[Page 655]

(a) the interception was lawfully made; or

(b) the originator thereof or the person intended by the
originator to receive it has expressly consented to the admission thereof.

We are concerned only with para. (a) and particu­larly with the
words ""lawfully made"". We are not concerned with subs. (3) of this
section because it was not argued nor indeed could it have been argued in these
circumstances that an unauthor­ized entry, if that is the correct description
in law of the action taken here, is ""an irregularity in procedure"".
The second issue therefore reduces itself to an interpretation and application
in the circumstances of this appeal of the words ""lawful­ly made"". In
reality this is only an independent issue if the words mean something other
than `made in accordance with Part IV.1 of the Code’.

Before examining these Code provisions in detail a word
should be said about trespass, a subject prominent in the submissions in this
Court and in the judgments below. Trespass, in its broad scope, is but one of
the considerations which must be taken as having been within parliamentary con­templation
in the adoption of these extensive meas­ures. Trespass in its most ancient
form, more properly trespass vi et armis (by force and arms), involved
direct interference with the person. Even­tually other forms of trespass, in
particular tre­spass quare clausum fregit (involving the physical act of
breaking the ""close"" around the individual’s land or premises), and trespass
de bonis asportatis (relating to personal property) were developed to cover
certain particular wrongs. The action for trespass gradually expanded to
embrace wrongs suffered as the result of the exercise of indirect force. The
ancient form of trespass also gave rise to the ""action on the case""
and from this the concept of intellectual trespass developed, thus further
extending the plaintiff’s rights with respect to indirect or non-physical
wrongs. From the fertile ground of trespass likewise sprang the action in assumpsit
from which in turn came the present action in contract. In the simple
Anglo-Saxon community the breach of a recognized right was a

trespass, including the right to rely on another’s promise.

Eventually, trespass was narrowed down in the common law to the
immediate damage caused by the act complained of, whereas consequential injury
was identified as an action upon the case: Fifoot, History and Sources of
the Common Law: Tort and Contract (1949), at p. 185; Fleming, The Law of
Torts (6th ed. 1983), at p. 15. In the circumstances arising in this case,
one must be concerned with the consequences, if any, of trespass above the
surface of the land, that is in open space. Whether mere entry into air space
amounts to trespass has been a matter of some debate in the law. An earlier
general rule stating that an action did arise under the maxim that breach of
the close includes its vertical extension has been referred to as a
""fanciful phrase"" of ""dubious ancestry"":
Fleming, The Law of Torts, supra, at p. 42. It has, for example, been
deter-mined that firing objects across property in air space was not actionable
unless as a nuisance: Clifton v. Bury (1887), 4 T.L.R. 8; whereas
if the object and, perhaps, in the alternative, the force, contacted a surface,
the action was in trespass: Pickering v. Rudd (1815), 4 Camp. 219, at p.
220, per Lord Ellenborough. In more modern writings, the action of
trespass has been assigned to a lesser function in the field of tort giving
rise to a remedy only for material damage sustained by an occupier as the
direct result ""of another’s activity involving an entry,
whether personal or by means of animate or inanimate objects"":
Fleming, The Law of Torts, supra, at p. 36. Trespass is largely the subject
of civil law rather than criminal law (see Glanville Williams, Textbook of
Criminal Law (1978), p. 894).

We are not here directly concerned, be it remembered, with
determining whether the con-duct of those who invoked the authorization order
and intercepted these personal communications was either tortious or criminal.
We are only concerned

[Page 657]

with the admissibility of the information thereby harvested.

lt is generally an acceptable starting point in examining
legislation involving the invasion of individual rights to restate Semayne’s
Case (1604), 5 Co. Rep. 91 a. The invasion here is of privacy and this
concerns both the personal aspects and the property aspects of privacy. The
inviolable nature of the private dwelling is a basic part of our free society.
This concept has long been a bulwark against tyranny of the state be it
organized as an absolute monarchy or as a democratic state under a
constitutional monarch. Indeed for three hun­dred years the concept that a
person’s home is his castle has been the defence of the citizen in an endless
variety of challenges brought against him in the name of the state. Semayne has
been the shrine of his or her privacy. The concept recog­nizes an internal
security but also an external dependence. The home is not a castle in
isolation; it is a castle in a community and draws its support and security of
existence from the community. The law has long recognized many compromises and
outright intrusions on the literal sense of this concept: for example, the right
of the community to search on proper authorization; the right of pursuit; the
right of eminent domain; the right of the community in applying zoning
restrictions and safety standards; the compulsory participation in community
established health facilities including sewer and water systems; and many more.
Most of these intrusions carry inspection rights of varying modes and degrees.
As Dickson J. (as he then was) put it in Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2
S.C.R. 739, at p. 743:

there are occasions when the interest of a private
individual in the security of his house must yield to the public interest, when
the public at large has an interest in the process to be executed.

The community interest in crime detection and suppression also
inevitably entails intrusion on the castle concept. Part IV.1 is a recognition
of the technical realities of the age of communications as they affect crime
detection and prevention in particular,

[Page 658]

and the right to privacy in general. It represents a balance
selected by Parliament of these conflicting concepts and interests. Intrusion
into privacy is an obvious and inevitable concomi­tant of an authorized crime
detection procedure. Explicitness is a requirement before legislation may
properly be found to be intrusive of these basic rights. However, the need to
express the obvious is not present in the canons of statutory interpretation.

There are four general interception procedures available under
the definition of authorized devices under Part lV.1 which are widely discussed
in the literature in this country and in the United States concerning the
subject of interception of personal communications. These four procedures are:

(a) telephone wiretapping;

(b) radio eavesdropping;

(c) acoustic eavesdropping, active and passive; and,

(d) microwave and laser beam eavesdropping.

Telephone wiretapping in some forms requires personal entry by
the interceptor into the designated premises for the purpose of installing
equipment. Radio eavesdropping, involving the use of trans­mitters, necessarily
involves personal entry into the designated premises for the purpose of their
instal­lation in the vicinity of the anticipated personal communications.
Active acoustic devices and microwave and laser beam eavesdropping neces­sarily
entail the direction into and onto the desig­nated premises of energy in the
form of electro­magnetic waves, or acoustical waves in the case of acoustic
devices. Thus, all forms of eavesdropping (other than passive acoustic
eavesdropping by means of parabolic and other like microphones) entail either
the personal entry into the premises by the interceptor or his collaborators
for the purpose of installing equipment; or the invasion of the premises in
question by directing at those premises energy in the form of electromagnetic
waves. It should be added in connection with acoustic interception that
acoustic eavesdropping,

[Page 659]

unassisted by long-range reception devices, also entails personal
entry into premises or onto the land immediately adjoining for the purpose of overhearing
conversations. That is the procedure of interception of personal communications
in its oldest and most basic form.

Where the intercept is done by means of inter­cepting telephone
wires leading to and from the premises, no personal entry by the interceptor is
necessarily made into the named premises. For an interception to be made by
means of a radio device, the device, a small transmitter, must be placed inside
the premises where it is anticipated that the private communication, that is
the conver­sation, will take place. A hybrid intervention occurs where personal
entry is made into the prem­ises for the purpose of inserting a device into the
telephone instrument on the premises which enables the interceptor, by
thereafter directing electrical energy into the building over the tele­phone
wires as and when desired, to ""electrically remove"" the telephone
from its hook and thereby convert the telephone into a room listening device
similar to a radio bug. Thereafter, the device can be turned on and off
repeatedly and indefinitely without any further personal entry by the intercep­tor.
Where the private communication is picked up and recorded by acoustical means,
that is by long-range directional acoustical devices, no personal entry is
necessarily required depending on the situs of the conversation being
intercepted. New modes of physical entry occur where the private com­munication
is intercepted by means of devices such as ""coherent lasers""
employing electromagnetic forces beamed onto and into buildings which record
and translate vibrations on window panes or walls so as to intercept
""private communications"" taking place inside the building. No
personal entry by the interceptor is required. (See Studies for the National
Commission for the Review of Federal and State Laws Relating to Wiretapping and
Electronic Surveillance, Washington: 1976 (""NWC Commission
Studies""), at p. 182, and Encyclopedia Britannica, Micropaedia,
Ready Ref­erence and Index, vol. III, at p. 841). Technically this is an entry
into or a trespass against the

[Page 660]

premises in question, particularly if the sensor is physically
attached to the outer wall of the prem­ises or a common wall between the
premises and another property. It would be a strange result indeed if a court
were required to construe the words of the section in such a way as to render
evidence inadmissible if obtained and recorded by radio, or if obtained by the
recording of vibrations in the enclosure of the premises by energy directed
from outside the lands and premises, but not if withdrawn from the building by
an invasive use of the telephone wires leading into the building or by
detection of vibrations in a common wall. Further-more, s. 178.11  throughout
refers to all manner of devices, acoustic, mechanical, electromagnetic
""and others"". By the clearest possible inference the authorization
may refer to and authorize the use of one or more of these devices.

Radio as a method of interception entails, in its most common
form, the installation of a transmitter at the site where the private
communication to be intercepted is to take place. By the definitions included
in and related to Part IV.1, radio is included in the authorized interception
techniques so that its use is embraced in the provisions which are necessarily
broad and in the terminology there employed which is designedly embracive of
these diverse techniques. As will be seen, a detailed analysis of the wording
of the section happily produces a result consonant with the general purport of
Part IV.1.

Wiretapping, the use of telephone wires and equipment by which
the telephone company provides telephone service to its subscribers, is per­haps
the most common interception procedure or device. Indeed, the expression
""wiretapping"" appears to be used generically in the present day
community to cover all manner of interception of private communications. Two
methods of eaves-dropping via telephone are described at p. 158 of the NWC
Commission Studies:

[Page 661]

Telephone audio eavesdropping can be accomplished by two
methods that involve connecting various electron­ic devices to this system
[i.e. the telephone system]. The first and most widely publicized method uses
wiretap paraphernalia which intercepts conversations directly from the
telephone wires and requires no entry into the target premises. The second
method is that which uses a portion of the telephone system for room
eavesdropping and usually requires physical entry into the premises.

Wiretapping is only feasible where telephone service is being
provided to the place where the interception is to be made. No mention of a
tele­phone number is made in the authorization of August 25, 1977. Telephone
numbers are men­tioned in the second authorization. A private com­munication
between persons named in the authori­zation and other persons includes by
definition an oral exchange or conversation which occurs by means of the
telephone situated on the premises identified in the authorization and the
telephone at the other end of the conversation. The authorized interceptor taps
into the pair of telephone wires coming out of the premises by attaching a
receiver somewhere on those wires outside the premises at a point where the
interceptor can listen to and, if desired, make a recording of the conversation
be­tween a person on the designated premises and a person situated somewhere
else and using the tele­phone service connected to those premises. The
telephone company, of course, is not authorized by the subscriber at either end
of the call to make use of or to permit use of the telephone wires and
equipment for this purpose. If the interceptor taps the wire at a point outside
the boundaries of the property identified in the authorization as the place
where the interception is to be made, then no trespass in the sense of personal
entry by the interceptor is committed against the property under surveillance.
The result, however, is that the voice of the person who participated in the
private communication inside the wiretapped premises has been overheard and
recorded without his knowl­edge or authority. The interceptor has by tele­phone
entered the privacy of the dwelling, or other place where the person is
situated, and recorded his or her private telephone conversation. The privacy
of the parties to the private communication

[Page 662]

has been invaded. If the interceptor tapped the lines of the
phone company without that com­pany’s consent, other violations of rights may
have occurred. As between the interceptor and the person whose private
communication has been intercepted, what has in reality occurred? The
interceptor has, through the agency of the tele­phone equipment, caused a
current, an electron flow, to be passed through equipment in use by the person
under investigation in a telephone subscri­ber’s dwelling so as to allow the
acoustical waves produced by the person using the phone to be impressed in
analogue form on the current in the phone wires. The current bearing in
electrical ana­logue the acoustic waves produced by the voice of the
interceptee leaves the premises and travels to the point where the interceptor’s
equipment retrieves the signal and reconstitutes the voice of the interceptee
and that of the person at the other end of the telephone conversation, in
acoustic form. The interceptor can at the same time record the electrical
analogue for acoustical reproduction of the private communication at a later
time. A variation of this procedure enables the interceptor to send a current
into the premises by means of the telephone wires and thereby switch on the micro-phone
in the telephone unknown to the occupants so as to enable the interception of
any oral com­munications which occur in the vicinity of the electronically
activated telephone. By directing an electrical current into the premises, the
interceptor can, in effect, convert the telephone into a `bug’ for
eavesdropping in the room. For a more detailed description of the physical
events occurring during this process, see NWC Commission Studies, supra, at
p. 160; and David Watt, Law of Elec­tronic Surveillance in Canada
(1979), at pp. 181-84. No one suggested in this Court, none of the courts
below has suggested, and no case has been drawn to the attention of this Court,
where it has been decided that this process would not be within the terms of
Part IV.1 or that this most common of all interception procedure could not be
authorized under Part IV.1. Yet there has been the clearest trespass against
the premises, in the civil law sense of that term, by the deliberate direction
of an electrical current into those premises in order to transport out of the
premises the private communication

[Page 663]

of the person speaking inside the prem­ises. All of this was
unauthorized by the telephone company, by the subscriber to the telephone
service, or by the person whose private communica­tion was, by this device,
intercepted. The electrical current acts as a boomerang thrown across the
subscriber’s property and retrieved by the intercep­tor after it has picked up
the personal communica­tions of any inhabitants. The electronic equivalent
employing physical force in the form of an electric current nonetheless amounts
to an ancient trespass quare clausum fregit. Parliament has clearly
granted authority for issuance of an authorization to intercept, in this
manner, private communica­tions at designated premises. Nothing in the Code requires
the consent of the telephone company whose system is thus invaded by the
interceptor.

The same result can be achieved by the use of acoustical, light
or radio waves originated and received by the interceptor off the lands and
prem­ises described in the surveillance authorization. See a compendium of such
techniques gathered in the NWC Commission Studies, supra, at p. 152, and
pp. 168-83. Again the result in law is simple civil trespass on the property
named in the authori­zation unless the legislation has authorized such
procedures. Indeed, high intensity microwaves so employed must amount to
trespass to the person, entailing, as they do, physical discomfort and injury.
See NWC Commission Studies, supra, at p. 177. It follows, at least as
regards wiretapping and interception by energy directed into the prem­ises,
that no trespass occurs, and even if it does, it is authorized by Part IV.1 and
no cause of action arises.

Part IV.l contemplates at least three fundamen­tal processes or
devices which may be employed in the interception of a private communication:
elec­tromagnetic (radio, telephone and optical), acous­tic and mechanical
devices. There is no particular

[Page 664]

provision relating to each of these special types or forms of
communication. All are embraced in the same general provisions. It is therefore
clear that Parliament, in Part IV.1, is legislating with refer­ence to the
employment of any equipment or procedure relating to the electromagnetic spec­trum
(ranging as it does through the spectrum from radio waves to light waves), the
acoustic vibrations above or below and including the range of the human ear,
and to mechanical devices, for the purpose of intercepting oral (and other) com­munication
occurring anywhere. This is broad legislation embracing in these extensive
provisions the use of a wide range of radio, telephone, optical and acoustical
devices for listening to and record­ing private communications as broadly
defined. It is not ""wiretapping"" legislation,
nor eavesdropping legislation, nor radio regulation. It is the regula­tion of
all these things and ""any other device"" that may be used to intercept
intelligence reasonably expected by the originator not to be intercepted by anyone
other than the intended recipient. The scheme of regulation includes the
judicial authori­zation to intercept issued in response to a request for
permission to intercept personal communica­tions by any device contemplated by
the Code, supported by the requisite information as specified in the
regulation. Part IV.1 has authorized the use of all such procedures. They
involve the invasion of property by directed energy for the purpose of
extracting private communications occurring therein or thereon, yet no express
authorization of the essential ""entry"" on to the premises under
surveillance is to be found in the provisions. Parlia­ment should not be taken
to have authorized the use of procedures and equipment without, at the same
time, supplying the public officials undertak­ing these duties with the
appropriate means and authority to carry them out. This, in my view, Parliament
has done by authorizing the employment of apparatus, some of which necessarily
entails such forms of ""entry"".

[Page 665]

Part IV.1 did not issue from Parliament in an era of primitive
communications. It must be read and applied with an awareness of the community
it seeks to regulate. It was not the age of smoke signals or even simple
telephony into which these extensive regulations were launched. Neither are the
forces of criminal investigation, which are brought under the umbrella of these
regulations, faced with the simpler task of bygone days. Rather they are
contending with techniques employed by the criminal elements in a community
equipped with all the modern paraphernalia of electronic communications. The
reasonable needs of the com­munity for adequate crime detection services util­izing
modern technology, as well as the reasonable need of the community for
protection from these new techniques, are considerations which must have been
in the forefront of the parliamentary mind. Part IV.1 seeks to embrace these
twin reali­ties produced by modern interception techniques. At the same time,
Parliament must be assumed to have taken into account the size and complexity
of present-day criminal operations, particularly in the field of drug
trafficking. In my view, Parliament has clearly revealed in Part IV.1 an intent
to embrace all these conditions in a comprehensive network of regulations, and
in my reading of these provisions, it has succeeded in so doing.

Having established the offence of unauthorized interception of
personal communications, Part IV.1 proceeds to lay out the exceptions of
consent and authorization. The procedure prescribed for obtaining an
authorization is detailed in s. 178.12 . The application must be made to a judge
of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction (other forums not here relevant
are omitted) by the Attorney General of a province or by the Solicitor General
of Canada or their respective agent, and shall be supported by an affidavit of
a peace officer or public officer setting forth the factual basis for the
belief that an authorization should be given together with particulars of the
offence under investigation, and ""the type of private com­munication …. to
be intercepted"". The affidavit is required to set out as well:

[Page 666]

(a) the person the interception of whose private
communication is believed on reasonable grounds may assist the investigation of
the offence in question;

(b) a general description of the nature and loca­tion of the
place (if known) ""at which private communications are proposed to be
intercepted""; and,

(c) ""a general description of the manner of inter­ception
proposed to be used"".

Section 178.13  provides the authority to the judge to issue the
authorization. There are two threshold considerations which must be met:

(a) that the authorization requested would be in the best
interests of the administration of justice; and,

(b) that other investigative procedures have been tried and
have failed, or would be unlikely to succeed, or the urgency is such that it
would be impractical to carry out the proposed investigation using only other
investigative procedures.

The authorization then must include;

(a) the identity of the person whose private com­munications
are to be intercepted if that be known;

(b) a general description of the place at which the private
communications may be intercepted if that can be done; and

(c) a general description of the manner of inter­ception
that may be used.

Finally, and in my view most importantly, s. 178.13(2)(d) directs
that the authorization shall ""contain such terms and conditions as the
judge considers advisable in the public interest"". The
foregoing are the terms of Part IV.1 which deal with the application for
authorization and the contents of the authorizing order itself.

Thus we come to the interception procedure employed in these
proceedings. The interceptor, acting under the authorization, deposited on the
premises named in the order as the place where the interception was to be made,
a battery-powered radio transmitter. This device performed the same

[Page 667]

function as the telephone in the simple wiretap example above.
The radio transmitter produced the same electrical analogue, albeit on a radio
frequency, as did the telephone microphone, and again the interceptor, by means
of a radio receiver located off the premises, converted the radio fre­quency
analogue back to an acoustical representa­tion of the private communication in
the same way as the interceptor did in the wiretap procedure described above.
In the first instance, the entry was committed by sending into the premises,
without any revealed authority from the owner of the premises or the owner of
the telephone system, an electrical current which transported the private
communication out of the premises. In another mode of interception mentioned
earlier, the inter­ceptor directed light or radio energy into and onto the
premises and made the interception of private communications by extracting such
communica­tions from the reflected energy returning to the interceptor. The
person who placed the radio transmitter in the premises entered and may have
thereby trespassed against the lands and premises of the owner or the person
entitled to possession. All these forms of transgression against the prem­ises
named in the authorization are inherently and obviously means contemplated in
Part IV.1 for invoking the authority granted by Parliament for the interception
of private communications if judi­cially authorized.

It is to be noted that when the owner or person entitled to
possession of the premises in question is not a person named in the
authorization as being under surveillance and is not the person whose private
communication is intercepted, other impor­tant considerations may arise but
with which nei­ther s. 178.16  nor this appeal are concerned. If none of the
persons named in the authorization has an interest in the property where the
interception is made, then there is no right in them to complain of the
trespass to real property as such a right is limited to the owner or person in
possession of the properties subjected to the trespass. There is no indication
on the record here whether the authori­zation names the owner or person in
possession as

[Page 668]

one of the persons whose private communications may be
intercepted.

In my view, the provisions of Part IVA when read as a whole
clearly contemplate, require and authorize, by necessary implication and
unavoid­able inference, the placing of a radio device on the premises at which
the intercept is to be made, where the use of radio equipment is authorized for
the interception of a private communication. I therefore would answer the
initial question, which arises at this point in the analysis of Part IV. 1, by
concluding that Parliament has thus empowered a court to authorize the use of a
radio device, such as was used here, for the purpose of intercepting a
designated private communication. Since the device could not otherwise function
as an intercep­tion ""device"", Parliament has cast the section broadly
so as to empower the court in its discretion to authorize the placing of the
""device"" inside the premises designated in the authorization whether
or not what would otherwise be a trespass to someone’s lands and premises may
occur and whether or not the owner of such lands and prem­ises is the person
whose private communication is to be intercepted. Once Parliament empowers a
court to authorize such action, and the court does so, there is no trespass in
law.

There are, of course, differences in magnitude in the potential
seriousness of the several interception procedures which Part IV.1 empowers a
court to authorize. For example, it is one thing for a judge to authorize the
arrogation by law enforcement officers of a person’s private phone lines for
purposes wholly unauthorized by the subscriber or the telephone company, for
the purpose of making an interception by telephonic means on the designated
premises. It is quite another thing to authorize an investigator to make
clandestine entry in the night into a private dwelling, perhaps owned by a
stran­ger to the alleged criminal activity. It takes no imagination to foresee
that serious consequences could follow. The public interest might be damaged
far out of proportion to any gain to the

[Page 669]

community in crime prevention and detection. These considerations
are discussed in the Report of the National Commission for the Review of
Federal and State Laws Relating to Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance, (Washington,
1976) (""NWC Report"", at pp. 42-44). In my view, all this was
foreseen by Parliament when it included s. 178.13(2)(d) which requires the
authorizing judge, when granting the authorization, to include in the
authorization ""such terms and conditions as the judge considers advisable
in the public interest"".

The issuing court must be alert to the need for a complete
demonstration of the necessity for the intercepting procedure. By its nature
the radio transmitter or bug picks up all communications in its area. It is
indiscriminate. Unlike the simple wiretap, all communications occurring in a
room or other area within its listening range are picked up and relayed to the
interceptor. It does not confine itself to telephone calls to or by designated
individuals. Its installation is a more serious inva­sion of privacy than the
basic wiretap installation. The latest studies in the United States indicate
that due to technical problems, unreliability of equipment and problems which
might arise upon the installation of the device, radio devices are seldom the
subject of authorization: see NWC Report, supra, at p. 44. The telephone
instrument, when modified to emulate a bug, raises the same considerations. The
nature of the place of intercep­tion may also require special precautions by
the authorizing court. Equally obvious is the danger associated with the use of
microwave and laser beams directed at the designated premises. The courts,
therefore, must perform carefully and thor­oughly their duty under s.
178.13(2)(d) and pre-scribe terms and conditions which may be advis­able in the
public interest under which these invasive devices may be installed. This
judicial function is the essential safeguard of the public interest in the
bilateral operations of Part IV.1 which must at once be both a shield against,
and an instrument for, the invasion of privacy. It is for the court to ensure
the balancing of these interests

[Page 670]

within the plan prescribed by Parliament.

Third party occupants of premises who are directly affected by
the installation of these devices, including those persons who may inno­cently
accost the installer, will be in the same position at law as individuals are
generally under the Code in their relationship to the law enforcement
process. Their rights in civil law are affected by these provisions of the Code
in the same way as in the case of investigative procedures elsewhere
established in the Code. Procedural and substan­tive criminal law has
long been construed in this country to include the regulation of direct and
inevitably related consequences of criminal law investigation activities. This
will include those per-sons who own or are entitled to be in possession of the
affected premises. Civil liability of the law enforcement authorities engaged
in the proper exercise of the authority granted under the order of
authorization is likewise affected and controlled by the provisions of the Criminal
Code . These provisions of the Code, s. 40, for example, will apply
to the performance of the duties under Part IV.1 of the law enforcement
agencies in the same manner as such provisions apply in the case of like
actions taken under other provisions of the Code by the criminal
investigating agencies.

The power of authorization being found to reside in the section,
the next question is to deter-mine if the authorizations issued by the judges
in these proceedings are sufficiently broad to empow­er the action taken by the
law enforcement officers in placing the radio apparatus in the private prem­ises
and in renewing the batteries in that apparatus on another occasion, both
involving personal entry into the premises designated in the authorization.

An application may or may not expressly state an intention to
enter the designated premises. In interpreting the order of authorization many
of the

[Page 671]

considerations bearing on the interpretation of the terms of Part
IV.1, already discussed, apply to the terms of the order issued. Much of the
terminology of the order, as here, cornes directly from Part IV.1. The request
by the investigating agency for the authorization in the first instance, as
also was the case here, will follow the form and content of s. 178.12  and the
other provisions of Part IV.1. The court will understand the identical language
used in the application as in the Act as carrying the same meaning and will
imply the same conse­quences. Thus a request to install, amongst other
apparatus, a radio device, will necessarily entail its installation in or upon
the designated premises. Where the premises are a dwelling or any place (other
than a hotel room, perhaps), entry for the purpose of installation is a
concomitant to the use of such a device. This is expressly stated or taken for
granted in the legal literature in the United States over the last twenty-five
years and in Canadian writings as well. Professor Stanley A. Cohen, Invasion
of Privacy (1983), at p. 193:

Room or house bugs should be available in appropriate
circumstances. Covert entry in order to install and remove such devices is a
necessary concomitant of such a grant of power.

The judge may in response to such application issue an order in
broad terms, as was done here, or may particularize a type of device or devices
and their mode of employment. Either type of order is foreseen by the wording
of ss. 178.12(1)(e) and 178.13(2)(c); that is, ""generally describe the
manner of interception that may be used"". Having regard to the pattern of
Part IV.l, the breadth of authority granted to the court, the importance of the
subject matter, and the vitality of the role of the court in the legislative
plan as the guardian of the public interest, explicit response by the court to
the application for authority to intercept in many cases will require the
prescription of ""terms and conditions advisable in the public
interest"" pursu­ant to para. (2)(d) of s. 178.13 .

[Page 672]

The courts responsible for these orders of authorization must be
ever concerned with the impact of these orders on members of the commu­nity who
will obviously be directly affected by them. An order in general terms
following the wording of the appropriate subsection of Part IV.1 will not
invalidate the order or affect the admissi­bility of the evidence gathered.
Much to be pre­ferred, however, in many circumstances, would be a specific
description of the apparatus to be employed, the manner of interception, and
the terms and conditions appropriate to the action as revealed by the
information contained in the application for authority to intercept.

The authorization orders, supra, issued herein in my view
clearly authorized the interception of these private communications whose
admissibility is now in issue. The manner of interception ""that
may be used is interception by means of any electromagnetic, acoustic,
mechanical or other device"". This occurs in all the authorizing orders.
The persons whose private communications may be intercepted are those who
""resort to or use the premises"" described in the order. There is no
mention in the orders of Bouck J. or Toy J. that only private communications
which occur on the telephone on those premises may be intercepted. As already
observed, there are no telephone num­bers indicated for any of the premises at
which interception may be made in the authorization order of Bouck J. The
authorization being in the terms of the empowering section and not including
any limitation on the person authorized with refer­ence to the range of
electromagnetic devices which may be used, and there being no terms of the
authorizing order which exceed the authority granted under the Code, there
is no valid reason to read down the authority which permits the use of
electromagnetic devices and which devices include, as already discussed, the
radio apparatus here used. As already discussed, radio apparatus of this type
can only intercept private communications if installed in the premises. Of
simple necessity, therefore, is the result that installation of such a device
is permitted by the Code and in turn by the order. For the reasons
discussed above in connec­tion with the form and content and proper interpretation

[Page 673]

of Part IV. 1, I conclude that the orders herein issued by the
chambers judges, and under which the evidence in question was gathered, fully
comply with Part IV.1 and necessarily entail, by clear and irresistible
implication, the entry into the premises designated in the order for the
purpose of installing this radio device and the renewal batteries.

The third question remains to be answered: Is an interception
made by any or all of these means ""lawfully made"",
presuming the authorizing order in turn permits such interception? How much of
such conduct by criminal investigating forces can be authorized under Part
IV.I? Section 178.12(1)(e) and s. 178.13(2)(c) refer to ""the manner of
interception proposed to be used"" (in the former section) and
""the manner of intercep­tion that may be used"" (in the latter
section). The devices that may be used include ""electromagnetic
... or other device"". This clearly includes the ""device""
employed by the interceptor here, the radio transmitter. These provisions
clearly contem­plate the use of radio in these procedures. Had the police used
an intermediary or stool pigeon (such as an acquaintance or a person pretending
to be a utility company representative) to place the radio transmitter, usually
referred to as a bug, on the premises, a different kind of invasion of rights
might take place. If the stool pigeon were a friend or confidant or guest of
the person being investigated, neither a breach of the criminal law nor of any
right in the civil law which would give rise to a cause of action would appear
to have occurred. The private communication would be captured as was the case
here and transmitted out of the premises. The element of consent by one party
to the communication would, of course, be there present.

""Lawfully made"", in my respectful view,
refers to an interception made in accordance with the

[Page 674]

only authority to be found in the law, namely Part IV. I. An
interception made in conformity with an authorization, the terms of which
comply with Part IV. 1, is ""lawfully made"". No one has
suggested either in argument here or in any case cited that the legislative
sovereignty under s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act cannot support the
granting of a complete, lawful basis for an interception made by use of radio
in the manner here employed. The offence-creating provisions of Part IVA fall
within criminal substantive law, the evi­dence provisions fall within substantive
criminal law and criminal procedure, and the process of issuance of the
authorization falls within criminal procedure. Conversely, no suggestion has
been made that any provincial enactment could render unlawful an investigation
properly authorized under the Code provisions. No other federal legis­lation
to such effect has been identified. If the Code provision properly
construed empowers a judge to authorize an interception by means involving
personal entry (as I have found to be the case), the interception is, when made
pursuant to such authorization, ""lawfully made"".

What then is the effect in law of the entry into the premises by
the interceptor designated in the authorization for the installation of the
radio transmitter. Trespass is not by that name the subject of any
offence-creating provisions in the Criminal Code . Illegal entry of
private premises is of course the basis for offences in ss. 306 , 307  and 308 
(breaking and entering and being unlawfully in a dwelling house with intent to
commit an indictable offence). In the case of the latter sec­tion, the presence
in the house must be ""without lawful excuse"" but the entry need not
have been either a breaking or an entry with intent to commit an indictable
offence, so long as the latter intent is formed after entry. Section 73 of the Code
makes it an offence (forcible entry) to enter property in the possession of
another ""in a manner that is likely to cause a breach of the peace or
reasonable apprehension of a breach of the peace"". A provi­sion closer to
the circumstances here arising is found in s. 173 of the Code which
makes it an

[Page 675]

offence to ""loiter ... or prowl ... at night upon
the property of another person near a dwelling house situated on that property"".
Again the offence is conditional upon the presence by the accused on such
property ""without lawful excuse"". The resistance to a forcible entry
and trespass is authorized by ss. 40 and 41.

The term ""lawfully made"", when it appears in a
codification of criminal law, favours the conclusion that it means ""not
contrary to criminal law"". It would not be construed without something
more in the phrase, as meaning ""made in conformity with all
laws"". For example, it would be an extension of the ordinary
meaning of those words in their con-text in the Criminal Code  to adopt
an interpreta­tion ruling the interception to be unlawfully made because it
contravened the laws of copyright; or because it invaded a civil right such as
the right to privacy; or indeed, because the act of interception constituted a
tort such as deceit or trespass where the tort in question has no presence in
the Crimi­nal Code in the form in which the tort in question was
committed. This would appear to be a proper interpretative approach for several
reasons. Sec­tions 178.12 and 178.13 authorize interception generally,
including by means of acoustic and elec­tromagnetic devices. Some of these
interception devices entail civil trespass falling short of person-al entry by
the interceptor onto the designated premises; others entail a preparatory
entry. As we have seen, today’s technology includes the inter­ception of oral
communications inside a private dwelling by directing into or onto that
dwelling, acoustic and electromagnetic waves, including light waves, and
electron streams over telephone and electricity lines. By means of this
activity across the premises in question, the interceptor is able to draw out
from the premises oral communi­cations conducted therein. The Criminal Code  empowers
a court to authorize such procedures. It is unreasonable, in my view, to read
s. 178.16 of Part IV.1, a mini-Code of interception regulation, as rendering
the content of such interception inad­missible by reason of the fact that the
use of

[Page 676]

almost all of those procedures entails a mode of entry into the
premises amounting in civil law to trespass.

By virtue of s. 178.11 , the interception is crimi­nal if it
amounts to a wilful interception of a private communication. The issue on
admissibility then resolves itself into the simple question: does the personal
entry into the premises of the inter­ceptor, for the purpose of installing the
device, amount to a breach of Part IV.l, namely s. 178.11 ? That, in turn, takes
the inquiry into ss. 306 and 307, supra, and to the other sections of
the Code discussed in connection with those sec­tions. By those
provisions the offence is committed if entry is made with intent to commit an
indict-able offence. This requirement in turn leads back to s. 178.11  and the
question as to whether the intended interception was ""lawful"",
and whether it is authorized under ss. 178.12  and 178.13 . The trail is equally
circular if one starts the inquiry at s. 73 or s. 173 of the Code, supra.

Further support for my conclusions may be found by considering s.
287  of the Criminal Code  which provides in part:

287. (1) Everyone commits theft who fraudulently,
maliciously, or without colour of right,

(b) uses any telecommunication facility or obtains any
telecommunication service.

Section 287(2) of the Code repeats virtually ver­batim the
definition of ""telecommunication"", which we have already found in
other federal legislation, supra. The interceptor, in the ordinary
wiretap interception, ""uses [a] telecommunication facility"".
It is arguable that he has done so ""with-out colour of
right"" unless Part IV.1 by necessary implication authorizes the
""use"" of such ""telecom­munication"" facility. Whether the
officer has ""used"" the telecommunication facility may be a matter of
debate. In the simple factual sense, he has done so by connecting his
interception device

[Page 677]

to the phone wires which he then ""uses"" to acti­vate
(or ""actuate"" as it appears in the United States
literature, supra) his receiver. The intercep­tor, at the same time, is
""using"" the whole tele­communication facility including the telephone
instrument in the designated premises, the. tele­phone at the other
end of the line, and the connect­ing wires, as well as any intermediate
telephone exchanges and equipment through which the voice path may pass. It is
only because the interceptor does not speak and that he is not a subscriber
that he could not be said to ""use"" the telecommunica­tion facility.
It would be difficult for an accused who connected receiving equipment to the
""tele­communications facility"" (the telephone wires) in order to
record data passing over the system, to deny a ""use"" of such facility
only because the accused has not made use of the facility’s voice communication
capacity.

It might be argued that the interceptor acted ""without
colour of right"". Here the use of tele­phone tapping apparatus is not
expressly granted. If the interceptor may make a wiretap under colour of right
with a wiretapping device, so it may be that the radio transmitter was
installed ""with colour of right"". If that is so, the authorization
may be the basis for defence under s. 287 . It would be curious if that were so,
but still not a ""lawful"" basis for the making of an
interception under s. 178.11(1).

The Radio Act raises similar problems. The use of a radio
transmitter, which is the bug in these proceedings, is prohibited by that Act
unless li­censed under the statute. There is nothing to indi­cate any authority
under the Radio Act for the interceptor here to operate this
transmitter, nor is there any claim that the device is exempt under s. 3(2) of
the Act by reason of its limited power. All these considerations go to the test
of admissibility of evidence so received under s. 178.16(1) , that is

[Page 678]

""was the interception lawfully made?"" Similarly the
term ""lawfully"" cannot mean in accordance with any and all laws. The Copyright
Act  might be infringed by recording some private communica­tions. This
would not render the evidence inad­missible, and nor would interception by
means which might give rise to a cause of action in civil law. I conclude that
""lawfully made"" means made in accordance with Part IV.l,
""Invasion of Priva­cy"", the mini-Code regulating the manner and
extent of invasion.

Part IV.1 was recently before the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Papalia (1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 289. In those proceedings the authorization
order expressly authorized entry into ""such places as may be necessary in
order to install, monitor and remove any electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical
or other devices ...."" The manner of interception there authorized was
""by the use of audio trans­mitter and receiver, an electromagnetic,
acoustic device sometimes referred to as a microphone and amplifier installed
at or near ... "" the designated premises. Acting under this authorization,
radio devices were installed in two automobiles and an electromagnetic device
was connected to telephone wires inside the designated premises so as to use
that instrument for the interception of private communications in the same
manner as in the case of a radio bug. Covert entry was gained into these
premises for that purpose. The radio devices were likewise installed in the two
cars without the owners’ knowledge or consent. The court held the interception
thereby made to have been lawfully made and therefore admissible in evidence.
Brooke J.A., speaking on behalf of the court, stated:

... almost all instances of wire-tapping and electronic
surveillance involve conduct in the nature of trespass and this includes
surreptitious or covert entry. Without the consent of the owner, to interfere
with a telephone

[Page 679]

line, telephone receiver or transmitter or switching
equipment is a trespass .... I am convinced that Parlia­ment understood this
when this legislation was passed and intended to deal with the whole problem by
estab­lishing an acceptable scheme through the use of an authorization granted
by a judge only when it was genuinely necessary to do so judged on the criteria
laid down by Parliament to permit this invasion of privacy which carried with
it the necessary invasion of a private right.

Brooke J.A. then went on to conclude that it was not necessary to
expressly authorize such entry or conduct on the part of the law enforcement
agent ""when he grants the authorization to conduct elec­tronic
surveillance"" because such surveillance can be carried out only ""if
conduct such as that referred to is resorted to. The authorization carries with
it authority for the police officer to resort to conduct in the nature of a
trespass including entry to install the device necessary to conduct the
authorized electronic surveillance and the officer’s conduct in so doing is
lawful"".

To like effect are the observations of Chief Justice McGillivray
speaking in dissent in the Court of Appeal of Alberta in the Reference re an
Application for an Authorization (1983), 5 D.L.R. (4th) 601. The
Chief Justice there conclud­ed that the distinction between wiretapping and
bugging was known to and understood by Parlia­ment when Part IV.l was enacted.
Parliament also appreciated, in the Chief Justice’s view, that con-duct in the
nature of trespass, including surrepti­tious entry, was an integral part of
electronic eavesdropping.

I find further support for my conclusions on the questions
discussed above in the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Dalia
v. United States, 441 U.S. 238 (1979), where the Court examined Title III
of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.,
§2510-2520, which permits courts to authorize electronic surveillance by
government officers in specified situations.

[Page 680]

The origin of Part IV.1 is obvious when one observes its
remarkable similarity to Title ill. Title IlI prohibits the interception and
disclosure of ""wire communications"" or ""oral communica­tions""
(defined terms roughly equivalent to ""pri­vate communications""
in Part IV.l) except where a party to the communication consents, or where the
interception is made pursuant to a valid authorization obtained from a judge of
competent jurisdiction. Under §2518 of Title III an authoriz­ing judge must in
the authorization specify: the identity of the person, if known, whose communi­cations
are to be intercepted; the place where authority to intercept is granted; a
particular description of the type of communication sought to be intercepted,
and a statement of the particular offence to which it relates; the identity of
the agency authorized to intercept, and of the person authorizing the
application for the authorization; and the period of time for which the
authorization is granted. Under Title III the authorizing judge may allow an
interception through the use of any ""electronic, mechanical or other
device"".

As is the case in our Part IV.1, no mention is made in Title lII
of entry to the named premises as a means of facilitating an interception. How-ever,
there are two differences between Title III and our Part IV.1 which must be
noted. Firstly, Title Ill contains no provision similar to our s. 178.13(2)(d)
which allows an authorizing judge to impose conditions in the authorization
which the judge considers advisable in the public interest. Secondly, any
authorization under Title III must contain a provision specifying that the
interception shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize the extent of the
communications intercepted.

In Dalia, supra, the United States Supreme Court concluded
at the outset (at p. 248) that ""The Fourth Amendment [to the United States
Constitution] does not prohibit per se a covert entry performed for the
purpose of installing otherwise legal electronic bugging equipment"".
In response to the petitioner’s contention that Con­gress had not given the
courts statutory authority

[Page 681]

to approve covert entries for the purpose of install­ing
surveillance equipment, Powell J., delivering the majority opinion of the
Court, said at pp. 249-50:

Title III does not refer explicitly to covert entry. The
language, structure, and history of the statute, however, demonstrate that
Congress meant to authorize courts-in certain specified circumstances-to
approve electron­ic surveillance without limitation on the means neces­sary to
its accomplishment, so long as they are reason-able under the circumstances.
Title III provides a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of electronic
surveillance, prohibiting all secret interception of com­munications except as
authorized by certain state and federal judges in response to applications from
specified federal and state law enforcement officials .... Although Congress
was fully aware of the distinction between bugging and wiretapping ... Title
III by its terms deals with each form of surveillance in essentially the same
manner.... Orders authorizing interceptions of either wire or oral
communications may be entered only after the court has made specific
determinations concerning the likelihood that the interception will disclose
evidence of criminal conduct .... Moreover, with respect to both wiretapping
and bugging, an authorizing court must specify the exact scope of the
surveillance undertaken, enumerating the parties whose communica­tions are to
be overheard (if they are known), the place to be monitored, and the agency
that will do the monitoring.

Nowhere in Title III is there any indication that the
authority of courts under §2518 is to be limited to approving those methods of
interception that do not require covert entry for installation of the
intercepting equipment.

After examining the legislative history of Title III, the Court
concluded, at p. 252:

...,one simply cannot assume that Congress, aware that most
bugging requires covert entry, nonetheless wished to except surveillance
requiring such entries from the broad authorization of Title III, and that it
resolved to do so by remaining silent on the subject. On the con­trary, the
language and history of Title III convey quite a different explanation for
Congress’ failure to distinguish

[Page 682]

between surveillance that requires covert entry and that
which does not: Those considering the surveillance legislation understood that,
by authorizing electronic interception of oral communications in addition to
wire communications, they were necessarily authorizing surreptitious entries.

The majority of the Court concluded that Con­gress meant to
confer upon the courts the power to authorize covert entries ""ancillary to
their respon­sibility to review and approve surveillance applica­tions under
the statute"" (p. 254), and held that the surveillance order
need not include a specific authorization to enter covertly the premises
described in the order.

The majority of the Court therefore held that covert entry did
not render evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization inadmissible
under §2515 of Title III, which reads as follows:

§2515 Prohibition of use as evidence of intercepted wire or
oral communications

Whenever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no
part of the contents of such communica­tion and no evidence derived therefrom
may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or
before any court, grand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body,
legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a
political subdivision thereof if the disclosure of that information would be in
violation of this chapter.

In an earlier case, United States v. Scafidi, 564 F.2d
633 (1977), the United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, held that an
order grant­ing authorization to ""bug"" private
premises car­ried with it authority for secret entry to place and maintain the
device. With reference to this issue Moore J., for the Court, stated at p. 640:

Once a judicial officer is convinced by the facts presented
to him that electronic surveillance will aid in

[Page 683]

the detection of crime, his authorization that it be used
should then transfer to the appropriate police agency the decision as to the
precise mechanical means whereby the order is to be carried out. If the
instrumentality to be used is a ""bug"", the placing of such a bug must
of necessity be in the hands of the persons so authorized. And such placing
will have to be surreptitious, for no self-respecting police officer would
openly seek permis­sion from the person to be surveilled to install a
""bug"" to intercept his conversations.

It would be highly naive to impute to a district judge a
belief that the device required to effect his bugging authorization did not
require installation.

It is significant that the statute, generally so detailed in
its supervisory requirements, makes no mention of any need for a separate entry
order. That the statute requires general supervision by the courts over the bug­ging
operation does not even impliedly impose on them the practical enforcement
steps.

I am of the opinion, notwithstanding the differ­ences that do
exist between Title III and Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code , that the
approach adopted in the above two cases in the courts of the United States is
equally applicable to the legislation in force in this country. A helpful
discussion of the two enactments appears in Watt, Law of Electron­ic
Surveillance in Canada, supra, at p. 128.

In the judgment of McDonald J. in Re Applica­tion for
Authorization to Intercept Private Com­munications, [1982] 6 W.W.R. 533, 31
C.R. (3d) 31, his Lordship, at pp. 546 and 47 respectively, queried whether the
understanding by the United States legislators that authorizing interceptions
necessarily meant surreptitious entry as mentioned in Dalia, supra, necessarily
applied to the Canadi­an legislators.

There is much discussion in the courts below and in the course of
argument in this court based upon materials which originated in Committees of
Parliament of Canada, Hansard, and some ma­terials and texts which relate to
matters discussed during the legislative process leading to the pas-sage of
Part IV.1. This Court, in Re Anti-lnfla­tion Act, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373, had
occasion to

[Page 684]

deal with the use to which this kind of material can be properly
put. As Laskin C.J. said, at p. 387:

The material offered by the Attorney-General of Canada
concerned the social and economic conditions under which the Anti-Inflation
Act was passed and the evils with which it purported to deal.

To the same effect is the discussion by Beetz J., at pp. 470-71,
concerning the use of policy statements and other material tabled in the House
of Com­mons and in Committees of the House. This ma­terial is not considered by
the courts in arriving at the proper construction to be placed upon lan­guage
used by the Legislature, but only with refer­ence to the aims of the
legislating body and the evils with which it was then contending. See also Lower
Mainland Dairy Products Board v. Turners Dairy Ltd., [1941] S.C.R. 573, per
Taschereau J., as he then was, at p. 583; Home Oil Distributors, Ltd. v.
Attorney-General of British Columbia, [1940] S.C.R. 444, at p. 447, per Kerwin
J. as he then was; and .Black-Clawson International Ltd. v. Papierwerke
Waldhof-Aschaffenburg AG, [1975] 1 All E.R. 810, per Lord Reid at p.
814. Another source of material outside the record to which courts frequently
take recourse is other judgments dealing with the same subject matter, in this
case the nature of electromagnetic apparatus and the invasive characteristics
of pre­sent-day communication technology: see Buck v. Jewell-LaSalle Realty
Co., 283 U.S. 191 (1931), per Brandeis J., at pp. 200-01; Reference
re Regu­lation and Control of Radio Communication, [1931] S.C.R. 541, per
Smith J., at pp. 569-71; and Composers, Authors and Publishers Associa­tion
of Canada Ltd. v. CTV Television Network Ltd., [1966] Ex.C.R.
872, per Jackett P., at pp. 877-79. Courts take recourse in the
analysis and assessment of technical and specialized knowledge generally to
texts, encyclopedias, professional jour­nals and like sources, all as discussed
and illustrat­ed in Wigmore on Evidence (3rd ed. 1940), vol. 1, at pp.
21-22; Phipson on Evidence (12th ed.), paragraphs 46-60; and Cross on
Evidence (5th ed.), at pp. 154-160.

[Page 685]

Before the Protection of Privacy Act was enacted (1973-74
(Can.), c. 50) several articles and texts had been written and reports made on
the subject of wiretapping and electronic eavesdrop-ping. Actually the first
federal wiretapping legisla­tion is found in the statute incorporating the Bell
Telephone Company, 1880 (Can.), c. 67, s. 25, which made the interception of a
message trans­mitted on the company’s telephone lines, a misdemeanour. In 1965,
the government of the day had appointed the Canadian Committee on Corrections.
The Committee delivered its report, gen­erally called the Ouimet Report, to the
government in 1969. Recommendations were made in this Report and, as stated in
Morris Manning, The Protection of Privacy Act (1974), at pp. 4-5,
""Those recommendations were clearly adopted by Parliament"".
The Ouimet Report clearly recog­nizes throughout its study the distinction
between the use of wiretap and the use of electronic bug­ging equipment for
intercepting private communi­cations. The Committee defined these terms as
follows, at p. 81:

The term wiretapping is commonly used to describe the
listening in on conversations on the telephone through the use of electronic
equipment and other devices. Electronic eavesdropping or ""bugging"" is
a term commonly used to describe forms of eavesdropping other than wiretapping.

One of the common forms of eavesdropping involves the
placing of a concealed device in a specific location to receive and transmit
conversations.

After reviewing very limited provincial statutory regulation of
wiretapping (in Manitoba and Alber­ta, telephone legislation), the Committee
observed, at pp. 82-83:

Wiretapping is presently used by police forces in the
investigation of suspected criminal activities. The extent to which it is used
is not known. It is obvious, however, that electronic eavesdropping other than
wiretapping is

[Page 686]

used extensively in the investigation of certain kinds of
suspected criminal activity.

The Committee is of the view that federal legislation
controlling the use of wiretapping and electronic eaves-dropping in law
enforcement is required.

Throughout its Report, when discussing the sub­ject of
surveillance, the Committee always recog­nised the distinction between
wiretapping and elec­tronic eavesdropping. In its recommendations concerning
the extent of legislative control required, the Committee stipulated that the
judi­cial order of authorization should ""specify in detail the person or
persons whose conversations are to be intercepted, the place or places and the
facilities in respect of which the order is made ... "" (at p. 86). The
Committee, having prescribed the terms and conditions to be included in the
authorization then turned to the question of the ""Admissibility of
Conversations Obtained through Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance""
and reported, at p. 88:

The Committee is of the view that illegally
intercepted conversations should not be admissible against an accused at his
trial and that this principle of exclusion should apply to evidence derived
through such illegal interception.

(Emphasis in original.)

Clearly the Report was directed to the exclusion of evidence
gathered without authorization or conformity to the authorization as provided
in the proposed legislation.

Prior to the Ouimet Report there had been other writings and
studies in Canada dealing with this subject matter. See Report of the
Proceedings of the National Conference on the Prevention of Crime, Centre
of Criminology, University of Toronto, June 1965, at p. 70; Stanley M. Beck, Electronic
Surveillance and the Administration of Criminal Justice (1968), 46 Can. Bar
Rev. 643; British Columbia Report of the Commission of Inquiry
Into Invasion of Privacy (1967), (the

[Page 687]

""Sargent Report"") at pp. 30-31; Inquiry
Re Magistrate Frederick J. Bannon and Magistrate George W. Gardhouse (1968),
(the ""Grant Report"") at pp. 11-24; N.M. Chorney, Wiretap-ping
and Electronic Eavesdropping (1964-65), 7 Crim. L.Q. 434; and David A.
Cornfield, The Right to Privacy in Canada (1967), 25 U. of T. Fac. L.
Rev. 103. The courts had also considered the evidentiary ramifications of
police investiga­tions which made use of radio and recording devices: R. v.
Steinberg, [1967] 1 O.R. 733.

In the United States these investigative techniques came into use
much earlier and were discussed in the United States Supreme Court for the
first time in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928). The
decision of that court in Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41 (1967),
influenced con­gressional action undertaken shortly thereafter for the
regulation of wiretapping and electronic sur­veillance. There was considerable
literature on the subject. That bearing directly on the issue raised in these
proceedings may be found in Alan F. Westin, Science, Privacy and Freedom:
Issues and Pro­posals for the 1970’s, 66 Columbia Law Review 1003 (1966);
and that author’s text Privacy and Freedom (New York 1970); and Dash,
Schwartz and Knowlton, The Eavesdroppers (1959), at pp. 35-285; Kalven, The
Problems of Privacy in the Year 2000, Daedalus, Summer 1967, at pp. 876-77.
Government action began in earnest at the federal level with the appointment of
a presidential commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice
which reported in 1967. This report (at p. 201) clearly recognizes the
difference in vital characteristics between wiretap-ping and eavesdropping, as
did the proposed legis­lation annexed thereto which largely survived and
appears in United States Code at Title III. In the following year
Congress enacted the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Public
Law, 90-351, 82 Stat. 197 (1968), Title 111, Wiretapping and Electronic
Surveillance (now 18 U.S.C., §2510-2520).

[Page 688]

All of this Canadian material, and no doubt much of the United
States literature, judicial and legislative activities, were before Parliament
during the legislative process which began in 1969. (As observed in the Manning
text, supra, our Act follows very closely the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act of 1968.) The House of Commons Standing Committee on
Justice and Legal Affairs, after a review of the subject matter, reported to
the House of Commons in March of 1970. The Committee made numerous recommen­dations
relating to both wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping, and did so after
extensive hearings. A government study was undertaken in April 1971 into the
whole question of privacy and a report was filed in December 1972 under the
name ""The Task Force on Privacy and Computers"". In June of
1971 the Minister of Justice introduced the first bill relating to privacy.
This was followed by a like bill introduced in 1972 which was referred to and
examined by the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs which also
conducted hearings and reported to the House of Commons in 1972. That bill died
on the order paper and was followed by the introduction of the present Act in
April 1973 where again the matter was referred to the Standing Committee on
Justice and Legal Affairs. Once again the Committee conducted hearings and
reviewed the bill and reported to the House recommending several amendments.
During this three-year period the subject matter of privacy was examined by the
Senate in much the same way. An illustration of the depth of these prolonged
studies is found in the testimony of Professor James R. Thompson, Northwestern
University School of Law, before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal
Affairs, May 27, 1969, p. 1042:

Wiretapping-that is, interception and disclosure of
telephone conversations-is a Federal crime [in the United States] ....
Eavesdropping is a different matter. It may be divided into two kinds-that
which involves trespassory invasion of protected premises for example the
planting of a `bug’ in a home, or the insertion of a

[Page 689]

`spike’ mike into a common wall, and non-trespassory
actions, e.g. merely listening on one side of a common wall or aiming a
parabolic microphone at an open window.

The learned author of The Protection of Privacy Act, supra, observed,
at p. 3:

The Act in its present form was given most careful
consideration by both the House of Commons and its Standing Committee on
Justice and Legal Affairs. Both bodies studied the Act section by section and a
reading of the voluminous debates and reports provides an excel-lent view of
our parliamentary process in action.

Lengthy parliamentary contact with this matter is shown by the
five statutes, supra, enacted over many years and dealing with the
definition and regulation of telecommunication. Professor Beck, whose article, supra,
was mentioned many times in the Commons Committees’ Reports during the
process leading up to the 1974 Act, describes the state of affairs in 1968, at
p. 650:

To sum up, the limited number of public disclosures of
police use of electronic surveillance in Canada does not indicate limited use.

For a more detailed description of the devices available in
Canada for interception of private communications at that time, see Beck, supra,
p. 651, where the use of radio devices is discussed in detail. A similar
discussion occurs in the Sargent Report, supra, at pp. 30-31. The use of
microwave transmissions directed at premises under surveillance to withdraw
therefrom private conversations is likewise discussed in the Beck article, supra,
at p. 652.

Bearing in mind the amount of material gath­ered in the extensive
legislative process leading up to the enactment of the Protection of Privacy
Act in 1973, 1 must adopt the comments made by Chief Justice McGillivray in
the Reference re an Application for an Authorization, supra, at p. 614:

[Page 690]

In light of the record quoted above I have difficulty in
accepting the commission’s conclusions that Parliament was not well aware that,
apart from the isolated cases, the placing of transmitter devices on premises
occupied by a suspect would be expected to be done either by surreptitious
entry or by a trick.

It is not clear from the judgment of McDonald J., supra, at
p. 535, precisely what the investigating agency sought from the chambers judge;

The agents sought to have me make an order permitting the
interception of communications by microphone, and I granted the order in that
regard.

A microphone is, of course, incapable by itself of intercepting
anything and may be used in associa­tion with other equipment for both
wiretapping and eavesdropping. The judgment does not reveal the use proposed.
The learned judge then refused to authorize entry to install a
""microphone"". The court may there have been dealing with a
micro-phone designed to convert a telephone into a room-listening device
energized from outside the prem­ises, or a radio device. If the latter, the
authoriza­tion of interception by such device without means of installation is
futile. Later in his reasons, the use of ""the microphone""
was limited to circumstances where it could be installed without
""trespass"". Presumably, this refers to personal trespass by the
interceptor against the property or person of the interceptee. No example or
illustration was given of ""acceptable entry"" except,
perhaps, in a hotel room before the guest arrives.

Chief Justice McGillivray, as discussed earlier, took a different
approach. He read the legislation in the light of the evil that Parliament was
seeking to redress. Mr. Justice Clements, in the same court, in R. v.
McQueen (1975), 25 C.C.C. 262, expressly applied to ss. 178.16(1) 
the same reason­ing as the Chief Justice so as not to extend the application of
that provision ""to absurd lengths and hamper normal police
investigation to an

[Page 691]

extent that would seriously jeopardize the public interest in the
detection of crime"".

When seeking the proper interpretation of these provisions one
should ask if Parliament must be taken as intending to give an authority to the
investigating forces which could not be put to use. The invocation of powers
granted under Part IVA in aid of crime detection serves no purpose if the
authorization granted relates only to isolated pieces of equipment without any
direction or authorization that it be employed in association with authorized
devices for interception either by wiretapping or for electronic or acoustic
surveillance. It is one thing to leave too much to the discretion of the
investigative agency but quite another to stultify the whole undertaking.

It might be noted that the interpretations which I believe should
be placed upon Part IV.1 are also consistent with the provisions of s. 25(1)  of
the Criminal Code  and s. 26(2) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. I-23, although apart from these provisions my conclusions would still
stand. These sections read in part as follows:

25. (1) Every one who is required or authorized by law to do
anything in the administration or enforcement of the law

(a) as a private person,

(b) as a peace officer or public officer,

(c) in aid of a peace officer or public officer, or

(d) by virtue of his office,

is, if he acts on reasonable and probable grounds, justi­fied
in doing what he is required or authorized to do and in using as much force as
is necessary for that purpose.

26... .

(2) Where power is given to a person, officer or
functionary, to do or enforce the doing of any act or thing, all such powers
shall be deemed to be also given as are necessary to enable the person, officer
or func­tionary to do or enforce the doing of the act or thing.

[Page 692]

Section 26 of the Interpretation Act was con­sidered by
this Court in Colet v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 2. The issue there
before the Court was whether a warrant to seize firearms issued pursuant to s.
105(1)  of the Criminal Code  as it then was (now s. 101(1) )
authorized the officers acting under it to enter onto the property of the
person named in the warrant and search for firearms. With respect to s. 105(1) ,
which empow­ered the court to issue only a warrant to seize, this Court drew a
distinction between the authority to seize and the power to enter upon premises
for such a purpose. Ritchie J., delivering the judgment of this Court, stated
at pp. 9-11:

In support of the contention that the authority to seize
included authority to search, the respondent drew atten­tion to the provisions
of s. 26 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970 c. 1-23, and in so doing
contended that the power to search was a necessary ingredient of the power
""to seize"". Section 26(2) of the Interpretation Act reads as
follows:

(2) Where power is given to a person, officer or
functionary, to do or enforce the doing of any act or thing, all such powers
shall be deemed to be also given as are necessary to enable the person, officer
or functionary to do or enforce the doing of the act or thing.

As I have indicated, I am of the opinion that any statutory
provision authorizing police officers to invade the property of others without
invitation or permission would be an encroachment on the common law rights of
the property owner and in case of any ambiguity would be subject to a strict
construction in favour of the common law rights of the owner. This is made
plain from the following excerpt from Maxwell on Interpreta­tion of
Statutes, 12th ed., at p. 251 where it is said:

Statutes which encroach on the rights of the sub­ject,
whether as regards person or property, are sub­ject to a strict construction in
the same way as penal Acts. It is a recognised rule that they should be
interpreted, if possible, so as to respect such rights, and if there is any
ambiguity the construction which is in favour of the freedom of the individual
should be adopted.

It appears to me to follow tha[t] any provision authoriz­ing
police officers to search and enter private property

[Page 693]

must be phrased in express terms and the provisions of the Interpretation
Act are not to be considered as cloth­ing police officers by implication
with authority to search when s. 105(1)  and the warrant issued pursuant thereto
are limited to seizure. The extensive number of sections of the Criminal
Code  to which reference was made by the trial judge and which expressly
include the dual authority ""to search"" and ""to seize"" are
enough in themselves to indicate that the deeming provisions of s. 26(2) of the
interpretation Act are not applicable to the circumstances.

I am satisfied to adopt the reasoning of Mr. Justice Toy and
I share his view that a wide distinction exists between the meaning of ""to
seize"" and that of ""to search"". As Mr. Justice Toy has pointed
out, it is demonstrable that when Parliament sought to include the right to
search in providing for the authority to seize, it did so in specific terms ...

Nowhere in Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  or anywhere else
in the Code, however, is a distinc­tion made between
""interception"" of a private communication and entry for the purpose
of effect­ing the interception. Reasoning applicable to the well-recognized
distinction between search and sei­zure is not applicable to the present case.
Further-more, by virtue of s. 178.13(2) (c) an authorization must contain a
general description of the place at which the interception is to be made and
the manner of interception to be used. Part IV.l empowers the court to authorize
the interception of private conversations at specified locations by some
methods which of necessity require covert placing of electronic devices; and
all methods of interception included in Part IV.l involve some form of physical
invasion of the premises, as discussed supra. The Code provisions
relating to search and to seizure persistently distinguish be­tween these two
activities as was pointed out in Colet, supra. On the other hand, as was
pointed out by Chief Justice McGillivray in the Reference re an Application
for an Authorization, supra at pp. 609-10:

Here there is no element of invasion, no challenge to a
protesting occupier .... The success of the operation is that the transmitter
is planted without the knowledge of the occupier.

[Page 694]

Here the authority is not to seize or to search, but to
intercept private communications at a particular place.

The operation being regulated by Parliament in Part IV.1 was the
interception of conversations, a separate, distinct and complete transaction.
Parlia­ment did not divide into parts or phases, nor are there contrasting
measures elsewhere in the Code relating to these activities, as is the
case with the search provisions and the seizure provisions in the Criminal
Code .

Similarly, I am of the opinion that the recent decisions of the
House of Lords in Finnigan v. Sandiford and Clowser v. Chaplin, reported
to­gether at [1981] 2 All E.R. 267, and Morris v. Beardmore, [ 1981 ]
A.C. 446, are not applicable in this case.

It is the impact on and the significance of Part IV.1 in our
criminal law system that leads me to the interpretations which I have placed
upon these provisions. The importance of Part IV.l is the recognition by
Parliament of the need to curtail, or at least bring under positive control,
the practice of eavesdropping by one means or another. The necessary result of
such legislation is the express and implied recognition of invasion of citizens’
rights. This is the important crux of s. 178.1, et seq. It is the
invasion of the mind through the covert discovery and recording of the voice,
that is, that makes the powers granted in these provisions so significant in
our community. It is the entry into the mind by the power to intercept private
com­munications and not the entry into or upon per-sons’ property that is of
significance. I find the words of Chief Justice McGillivray in the Refer­ence
re an Application for an Authorization, supra, very apt (at p. 612):

Once that invasion was authorized the means were merely
incidental.

Once the power is granted by Parliament to authorize, and once
the authorizing power has been exercised, that which might have given rise to
tortious action in the past would no longer do so;

[Page 695]

the authorized conduct would not in law amount to trespass.

In summary, I can find no special limitation in Part IV.1 on the
use of radio devices for the interception of private communications. These
devices are clearly included in the permitted forms of interception. A radio
device of the type here employed, by its very characteristics, requires
installation at the situs of the private communica­tion. Apart from that
specific reality in the case of radio, all other forms of retrieval of private
com­munications from inside buildings entail some degree of physical presence
in the sense of invasion of the designated premises by physical forces. The
very fact that the authorization must include the place at which the
interception is to be made and a description of that place, must alert the
authoriz­ing authority to the nature and manner of the proposed interception.
The Code goes on to require the order of authorization to specify a
manner of interception as was done in the orders here. I believe that a court,
in issuing an authorization under Part IV.1, should, in the exercise of its supervisory
function, designate the type of device or devices which may be employed and the
proce­dures and conditions which, in the circumstances revealed in the
application, are necessary or advis­able in the public interest. The absence of
such detail does not go to the validity of the order because in many
circumstances only the general clauses of the subsections themselves will be
appropriate. My observation is intended to give emphasis to the importance of
the judicial role in the program of privacy regulation as prescribed by
Parliament in these provisions. I cannot but con­clude that Parliament
intentionally adopted a broad and, at the same time, detailed code of
provisions for the controlled interception of private communications, including
interception in the manner which here occurred. It is for the judiciary to
protect the public interest and to maintain in the authorizing process the
balance between the two competing elements inherent in the regulation of the
invasion of privacy in the detection of crime. Third party occupants and their
relationship to the officers engaged in installing these devices will be
governed by those provisions in the Code relating to the position of law
enforcement officers in the

[Page 696]

execution of their duties generally. The position of the
occupants under civil law will be affected by Part IV.1 in the same way as
other provisions in the Code may affect the rights in individuals
affected by law enforcement operations. Since 1977 a greater burden has been
placed upon the court to know the nature of the proposed intercep­tion and the
manner in which such interception is to be made. This in turn enables the court
to prescribe the terms and conditions which shall be considered advisable in
the public interest in all the circumstances surrounding the proposed
interception.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeals.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR NEW
BRUNSWICK

Criminal law—Police—Powers to arrest without
a warrant—Use of firearm—Pursuit across provincial border—Police officer firing
shots at suspect’s car—Territorial jurisdiction—Whether police officer used his
firearm in a careless manner without lawful excuse—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, ss. 25, 26, 84(2) [1976-77 (Can.), c. 53, s. 3], 233(4), 449 and
450 [R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 2, s. 5], 771(1).

Appellant, a member of the Quebec Police
Force, crossed the provincial boundary in pursuit of a vehicle believing the
driver had just committed the offence of dangerous driving. Despite several
warnings, the driver refused to stop. As a last resort, appellant fired two
warning shots. The driver eventually stopped but sped off as the appellant
approached his vehicle on foot. The appellant fired three more shots at the
car’s rear tires. The driver escaped. A New Brunswick provincial court judge convicted appellant of using his revolver
without lawful excuse in a careless manner. This judgment was overturned by the
Court of Queen’s Bench but restored on appeal. This appeal raised several
questions: (1) whether appellant was a peace officer authorized to arrest
without a warrant in New Brunswick; (2) whether appellant was protected by s. 25(4) of the Code
and (3) whether appellant used excessive force.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Appellant could arrest without a warrant as
he had reasonable grounds to believe that the driver was committing the offence
of dangerous driving. He therefore started his chase in Quebec qua a police officer with the
protection afforded to him under s. 25(4) of the Code. He still had
this protection at the time he used his gun in New
 Brunswick. As a matter of law, a peace officer who has
lawful authority to arrest a person under s. 450

[Page 313]

in one province and is pursuing that person,
retains, for the purpose of s. 25(4), his status of a peace officer in
another province inasmuch as the pursuit had commenced lawfully in his
jurisdiction and as long as such pursuit is fresh. The police officer should,
as did the appellant, endeavour to contact the local peace officers as soon as
possible, even during the pursuit, circumstances permitting. Once the local
authorities have taken over the pursuit, he ceases to be a peace officer and
becomes then a person assisting peace officers under s. 449(1)(b),
and, as such, will continue enjoying the protection of s. 25(4). The
reasonableness of appellant’s conduct must be assessed in the light of the
state of mind of a reasonable person reacting not to what was discovered after
the incident but to what the driver’s conduct in escaping suggested might be
discovered upon immediate arrest. Here, the driver persisted in his flight notwithstanding
all the warnings. The Court of Queen’s Bench found that the force resorted to
under the circumstances was not excessive. That finding was one of fact with
which this Court could not and should not interfere.

(1981), 35 N.B.R. (2d) 23, 88 A.P.R. 23, 22 C.R. (3d) 263, setting aside a
judgment of the Court of Queen’s Bench (1980), 31 N.B.R. (2d) 668, 75 A.P.R.
668, allowing the accused’s appeal from his conviction in Provincial Court on a
charge of careless use of a firearm without lawful excuse. Appeal allowed.

J. Roger McIntyre, for the appellant.

Paul Thériault, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—This Court is the fourth and the third
in appeal, to determine and deal with the issues arising out of an incident
that started in Quebec and finished in New Brunswick involving a

[Page 314]

member of the Quebec Police Force and a New Brunswick taxi driver.

Following this incident, the police officer was
charged in New Brunswick for having, without lawful excuse used his revolver
“in a careless manner contrary to and in violation of s. 84(2) (b)
of the Criminal Code ”, while the taxi driver was charged in Quebec with
dangerous driving contrary to s. 233(4)  of the Criminal Code . We do
not know what happened to the latter charge. This appeal concerns only the
former.

At trial, the constable was convicted by a
Provincial Court Judge. He appealed to the Court of Queen’s Bench and was
acquitted. The Crown appealed to the New Brunswick Court of Appeal which
allowed the appeal and restored the conviction. The constable now asks this
Court to restore the acquittal entered by the Court of Queen’s Bench. I think
he should succeed.

The Facts

The primary facts, as found by the trial judge,
are not disputed, and were accepted by the Summary Conviction Appeal Court
Judge, and are as follows.

On February 12, 1979, an off-duty taxi driver,
one Roger Chassé, left his residence in Campbellton, New Brunswick, to go to
Cross Point, in the Province of Quebec, to make a few purchases. He then
proceeded home and was taken in chase in Quebec by appellant, a Quebec police
officer. The reasons for this chase are related by the trial judge as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The testimony established
that the accused is a member of the Quebec Police Force, stationed at
Matapédia, Province of Quebec. In the course of his duties he stopped an
automobile driven by one Lucius Landry at the entrance to the bridge leading
from Cross Point to Campbellton, on the Quebec side. While he was questioning
the driver of the vehicle he had stopped, he saw a taxi coming toward him at
high speed. The driver who had been stopped, Lucius Landry, noticed nothing
unusual: he thought everything was just as usual. As the vehicle, which we now
know was a taxi driven by Roger Chassé, was approaching the bridge, the accused
said that it was being driven on the left side

[Page 315]

of the road, the police car and Landry’s
car being parked on the right side of the road at the entrance to the bridge.
When the accused looked in the direction in which the taxi was travelling, he
saw a van coming and said he expected there would be a collision, but that the
van pulled to the right to allow the taxi to pass. He then returned to his car
and set off in pursuit, travelling at speeds up to 70 mph on the
interprovincial bridge. The speed of the taxi was not determined. On arriving
at the intersection of Subway and Roseberry Streets in Campbellton, N.B.,
the accused, who was driving an unmarked car without a red light, said he drove
up beside the taxi using his siren and trying to stop it. The driver of the
taxi made certain gestures toward him with his finger and continued going,
turning onto Minto Street and slowing to a stop at Minto and Arran. On arriving
at Arran and Gerrard streets, the officer stated that he passed the taxi and
stopped, got out of his car, and the taxi tried to bump his vehicle. He then
reversed, drove around him and drove off to the south along Gerrard Street, and
from there onto Dover Street, where he was travelling at a speed of up to 70
mph. He then turned onto Tingley Crescent, which is a residential area, and
when he turned this corner the accused took out his 38 revolver and fired two
warning shots into the air. The chase continued around Tingley Crescent and the
taxi stopped at a point which was later found to be the taxi driver’s
residence. The accused jumped out of his car and ran toward the taxi with his
gun in his hand. The taxi began moving and the accused then fired three shots
at the taxi, puncturing a tire and making two holes in the mudguard. The
accused then lost contact with the taxi and reported the case to the R.C.M.P.

As I deal with this appeal I will occasionally
refer to a few undisputed facts disclosed in evidence which were not mentioned
in the trial judge’s narrative. Considering his approach to the issues arising
in this case, he probably did not think them of any relevance.

The Judgments

Before summarizing the judgments we should bear
in mind that the Court of Queen’s Bench was sitting as a Summary Conviction
Appeal Court, that the appeal was determined on the transcript of the record
and that the Queen’s Bench Justice’s right to determine matters of fact was no
less but no more than that enjoyed by a Court of Appeal under Part XVIII of the
Code in dealing with facts where leave has been granted to appellant on

[Page 316]

grounds involving questions of fact. It also
should be remembered that the New Brunswick Court of Appeal was limited to
questions of law (s. 771(1)  Criminal Code ), as is this Court.

The charge is under s. 84(2) :

84. …

(2) Every one who, without lawful excuse,
uses, carries, handles, ships or stores any firearm or ammunition in a careless
manner or without reasonable precautions for the safety of other persons

(a) is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment

(i) in the case of a first offence, for two
years, and

(ii) in the case of a second or subsequent
offence, for five years; or

(b) is guilty of an offence
punishable on summary conviction.

The relevant powers of arrest without warrant by
a peace officer are set out in s. 450(1):

450. (1) A
peace officer may arrest without warrant

(a) a person who has committed an
indictable offence or who, on reasonable and probable grounds, he believes has
committed or is about to commit an indictable offence,

(b) a person whom he finds
committing a criminal offence, or

(c) a person for whose arrest he has
reasonable and probable grounds to believe that a warrant is in force within
the territorial jurisdiction in which the person is found.

Those of the citizen at s. 449(1) and (3):

449. (1) Any
one may arrest without warrant

(a) a person whom he finds
committing an indictable offence, or

(b) a person who, on
reasonable and probable grounds, he believes

(i) has committed a criminal offence, and

(ii) is escaping from and freshly pursued
by persons who have lawful authority to arrest that person.

[Page 317]

(2) …

(3) Any one other than a peace officer who
arrests a person without warrant shall forthwith deliver the person to a peace
officer.

Dangerous driving is covered at s. 233(4) :

233. …

(4) Every one who drives a motor vehicle on
a street, road, highway or other public place in a manner that is dangerous to
the public, having regard to all the circumstances including the nature,
condition and use of such place and the amount of traffic that at the time is
or might reasonably be expected to be on such place, is guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and
is liable to imprisonment for two years, or

(b) an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

The right given persons to resort to force and
the justification they may invoke when having done so, if criminally prosecuted
as a result of arresting others, is grounded in s. 25 of the Code, the
more relevant portions being s. 25(1), (3) and (4):

25. (1)
Every one who is required or authorized by law to do anything in the
administration or enforcement of the law

(a) as a private person,

(b) as a peace officer or
public officer,

(c) in aid of a peace officer
or public officer, or

(d) by virtue of his office,

is, if he acts on reasonable and probable
grounds, justified in doing what he is required or authorized to do and in
using as much force as is necessary for that purpose.

(2) …

(3) Subject to subsection (4), a
person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force
that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless he
believes on reasonable and probable grounds that it is necessary for the
purpose of preserving himself or any one under his protection from death or
grievous bodily harm.

[Page 318]

(4) A peace officer who is proceeding
lawfully to arrest, with or without warrant, any person for an offence for
which that person may be arrested without warrant, and every one lawfully
assisting the peace officer, is justified, if the person to be arrested takes
flight to avoid arrest, in using as much force as is necessary to prevent the
escape by flight, unless the escape can be prevented by reasonable means in a
less violent manner.

The Trial Court

The trial judge decided that the police officer
was not empowered to arrest without a warrant. To this end he referred to
s. 450(1)(a) which in my opinion, has no application here, and he
made no reference to s. 450(1)(b). This, however, was not detrimental
to the accused’s position because the test a police officer must meet, in order
to be empowered to arrest without a warrant under s. 450(1)(a) is,
to the extent that it differs, at least as easily satisfied as that under
s. 450(1)(b).

He then (I have taken the liberty of rearranging
the order of presentation of the issues that Court addressed) set out the test
under s. 450(1)(a) as follows (he quoted without giving
references the following text)[1]:

[TRANSLATION] In order to constitute
reasonable and probable grounds, it is not sufficient if the peace officer acts
“in good faith”; his belief must be based on reasonable and probable grounds (Hopper
v. Clark (1911), 40 N.B.R. 568, C.A.). A mere suspicion or the desire to
obtain information cannot be a basis, in the event the accused refuses to
answer, for an arrest without a warrant (Koechlin v. Waugh and Hamilton (1957),
118 C.C.C. 24, C.A. Ont.). The peace officer must have come to the conclusion
that any ordinary person (the average man) would have made the same deduction
in the same circumstances.

Applying this test, with which I would not take
issue, to those facts of the case which he narrated, he concluded:

[TRANSLATION] Based on these events, which
occurred on the ramp leading to the bridge, it must be proven that Roger Chassé
committed a criminal offence.

[Page 319]

Having thus added a requirement to the test he
had previously enunciated, that is proof that Chassé had committed the crime of
dangerous driving, he then made a finding that Chassé had not committed the
offence.

[TRANSLATION] After having heard the
accused’s testimony, I cannot accept the suggestion that Chassé was driving
dangerously.

And it is on the basis of this conclusion that
he then found, as a fact, that the accused “did not have reasonable and
probable grounds to arrest Chassé without a warrant”.

In other words, in his view, while a peace
officer’s belief in the commission of the offence must be based on reasonable
and probable grounds, such grounds for arrest under s. 450 cannot exist if
it is found, as he did, that the offence was in fact not committed. It follows
as of necessity that this would be equally applicable to a citizen acting under
s. 449. Having made this finding, he did not, which was the only thing
left to do, assess the accused’s conduct in the light of the duty of care set
out in the charging section, s. 84(2) . Instead, he found that, in any
event, the force resorted to by the accused was excessive, referring to
s. 26 of the Code, and found him guilty.

It is far from clear whether he was making this
finding in the light of s. 25(4) or of s. 25(3) of the Code, or
of both, though it would appear that he was by then dealing with the accused qua
citizen making an arrest and no longer qua peace officer dealing
with someone taking flight to avoid arrest, as is suggested from the following
passages of his judgment.

[TRANSLATION] As the facts show, Chassé’s
identity was easily established and the pursuit itself was pointless.

Officer Roberge is not covered or
exonerated by s. 450  of the Criminal Code , and his status in New Brunswick
at the time he fired the shots at Chassé’s car was no different from that of an
ordinary citizen.

Even if the court had to apply ss. 25 and
26 of the Code to the accused, by using excessive force he did not meet the
standard required by those two sections, and is therefore criminally
responsible for his actions.

[Page 320]

And later on:

[TRANSLATION] Even if the accused had made
the correct assumption, and I have found that he did not, then s. 26 of
the C.C.C. applies and in view of all the circumstances, the description of the
taxi, its licence number and the identification of the driver I find that,
whether or not he had the authority to make an arrest in hot pursuit without a
warrant, he exercised excessive force by using a firearm without justification
in a reckless manner without lawful excuse.

The Court of Queen’s Bench

Quite properly the justice in appeal took his
facts from the trial judge. He took issue with the test for arresting without a
warrant set down by the trial judge and proceeded to enunciate what he
considered the proper test as follows:

The question is not whether the accused in
fact had reasonable and probable grounds but whether he honestly believed he
had the reasonable and probable grounds to justify his course of action.
‘Reasonable and probable grounds’ are not invoked to support an information or
a breathalizer demand but to substantiate a defence of justification. Any doubt
on this question of fact must be given the accused.

(Emphasis added.)

Having found error of law on the part of the
trial judge as to the test applicable he then proceeded, as he was perfectly
entitled to do, to making his own finding, applying to the facts what he
considered the proper test:

On this point and even though I did not
hear the witnesses give their evidence, upon reading the transcript I am of
opinion that the appellant honestly believed that the actions of the
taxi driver constituted the offence of dangerous driving for which he could
arrest without warrant and therefore he was in hot pursuit of a person in
breach of the Criminal Code .

(Emphasis added.)

Finding that the police officer had retained his
status of a peace officer even in New Brunswick, invoking R v. Shyffer (1910),
17 C.C.C. 191, he stated the next question thus “whether the appellant used
excessive force for which he would be

[Page 321]

criminally liable under s. 26  of the Criminal
Code ”. He then found as a matter of fact that under the
circumstances the police officer’s conduct did not “constitute excessive force
so as to render one criminally responsible”. Though he made no mention
specifically of s. 25(4) , it is evident that he was assessing Roberge’s
conduct in the light of the powers given a peace officer acting under
s. 25(4) . Indeed, had he dealt with the matter under s. 25(1)  and (3) 
he did not need to concern himself with whether Roberge was then acting as a
peace officer, because the offence alleged against Chassé is an indictable
offence, one for which a citizen may under s. 449  arrest without a
warrant. This would bring Roberge within s. 25(1)  and (3) , irrespective of
whether he was a peace officer or not. The rest of his judgment deals with the
degree of carelessness required for an offence under s. 84(2) , a matter he
did not need to deal with in view of his previous findings.

The Court of Appeal

That Court’s approach to the matter is totally
different and I must say, with the greatest of respect, somewhat puzzling. The
Court of Appeal took issue with the Queen’s Bench Justice varying the
conclusion of fact made by the trial judge to the effect that constable Roberge
was not authorized to arrest without a warrant, thereby implicitly agreeing
with the test upon which the trial judge had predicated that finding. Indeed they
said:

[TRANSLATION] After a careful reading of
the transcript of this case, I find no reason to disagree with the impressions
of the trial judge or his view of the facts. In a situation such as this a
higher court must rely on the facts and the general view of the case taken by
the trial judge.

They then approached the case by formulating the
issue as follows:

[TRANSLATION] In disposing of this appeal,
I find it is sufficient to examine the actions of the accused per se, without
regard to the complications of having to decide as to the extent of the
authority conferred on peace officers acting in a foreign territory. For all
practical

[Page 322]

purposes, it is sufficient to decide the
question of whether, in light of the circumstances surrounding the incident,
the accused “used a firearm in a careless manner without lawful excuse”. Put
even more simply, would the accused have been guilty of the offence if the
territorial jurisdictions of New Brunswick and Quebec had been the same and the
accused had been a peace officer for these territories?

A reading of this passage of their judgment
gives the impression that the Court of Appeal was of the view that officer
Roberge’s status in New Brunswick was of no relevance (that is whether he was a
peace officer, authorized to arrest without a warrant or not), and that a
finding of guilt under s. 84(2) (b) could therefore be made without
a consideration of whether he retained the protection of s. 25(4) or at
least s. 25(3). But that does not appear to have been what they meant.
Later on in their judgment they reformulated the question as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The question which the
appellate judge should have asked is therefore whether, when the accused
decided to use his firearm, he was reasonably justified in doing so in light of
the circumstances as a whole. The trial judge answered this question by saying:

At this particular time and place, however,
I find as a fact that the accused did not have reasonable and probable grounds
to arrest Chassé without a warrant…

(Emphasis added.)

It would therefore appear that the Court of
Appeal, having accepted the trial judge’s conclusion that the situation was not
one where an arrest could be made without a warrant, by either a citizen or a
peace officer, dealt with the matter as such, and concluded that using a gun
under the circumstances of the case was carelessness within s. 84(2) (b)
and that Roberge had no lawful excuse. This is borne out by their concluding
remarks where they say:

[TRANSLATION] Contrary to the finding of
the appellate judge, I consider that there was negligence by respondent in
using his firearm, and that, in light of the circumstances as a whole, no
lawful excuse was established.

[Page 323]

There are many ways to approach this case as is
well illustrated by the three judgments below.

As this Court and the Court of Appeal are
limited to matters of law, and the Court of Queen’s Bench limited to some
degree from interfering with the trial judge’s findings of fact, I propose to
approach the case as follows.

As a first step we should consider whether the
trial judge’s finding that constable Roberge could not arrest Mr. Chassé
without a warrant was predicated on an error of law. If the answer is no, the
trial judge’s finding cannot be reversed, that ends the matter, and constable
Roberge’s conviction will stand. Indeed, if Roberge could not arrest without a
warrant qua police officer or qua citizen, his use of the
revolver to try to stop Chassé’s car comes, in my view, well within the type of
carelessness contemplated by s. 84(2) (b). But if the trial
judge’s finding is predicated on error of law, then we must, before accepting
the Court of Queen’s Bench finding to the contrary that Roberge could arrest
without a warrant, first see if the Queen’s Bench finding is the result of the
proper test in law.

The test under s. 450(1)(b)

This Court, in R. v. Biron, [1976] 2
S.C.R. 56, laid down the test to be applied when determining whether a peace
officer is arresting (to use the words of s. 450(1)(b)) “a person
whom he finds committing a criminal offence”. Speaking for the majority,
Martland J. (Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ. concurring), said the
following (at p. 72):

My view is that the validity of an arrest
under this paragraph must be determined in relation to the circumstances which
were apparent to the peace officer at the time the arrest was made.

and further on (at p. 75):

The power of arrest which that paragraph
gives has to be exercised promptly, yet, strictly speaking, it is impossible to
say that an offence is committed until the party

[Page 324]

arrested has been found guilty by the
courts. If this is the way in which this provision is to be construed, no peace
officer can ever decide, when making an arrest without a warrant, that the
person arrested is ‘committing a criminal offence’. In my opinion the
wording used in para, (b), which is oversimplified, means that
the power to arrest without a warrant is given where the peace officer himself
finds a situation in which a person is apparently committing an offence.

(Emphasis added.)

Laskin C.J.C., dissenting, (Spence and Dickson
JJ., concurring), would have laid down the following test, adopting that of
Culliton C.J.S. in Attorney General for Saskatchewan v. Pritchard, (1961),
130 C.C.C. 61, 35 C.R. 150, 34 W.W.R. 458, where he had said (at pp. 65‑66
C.C.C, p. 154 C.R. and p. 462 W.W.R.), quoting that passage at
p. 61 in the Biron decision:

While a peace officer has no right to
arrest without a warrant a person he finds committing an offence unless an
offence was in fact committed, nevertheless even if the officer was in error
in so arresting, if he acted on reasonable and probable grounds he is given
protection under s. 25 of the Code.

(Emphasis added.)

The disagreement between the judges of this
Court in Biron was as regards the test when applicable to a party
resisting arrest. I have underlined the test the minority recognized as
applicable to the arresting officer when he is the accused. The majority would
have the same test for the arresting party and the party being arrested. As
regards the accused arrestor, I see no disagreement even though the majority
refer only to apparently committing. Indeed, I do not read the test laid down
by Martland J. as suggesting that it is sufficient that it be “apparent” to the
police officer even though it would be unreasonable for the police officer to
come to that conclusion. Surely it must be “appar-

[Page 325]

ent” to a reasonable person placed in the
circumstances of the arresting officer at the time.

This is no different than what Culliton C.J.S.
had said in Pritchard, an officer acting “on reasonable and probable
grounds”. Therefore this Court in Biron was unanimous as regards the
test for the arresting officer when he is the accused.

As Culliton C.J.S.’s formulation uses words with
which lawyers and courts are more familiar and which furthermore are resorted
to in the same section at s. 450(1)(a) I suggest we adopt that
wording rather than that resorted to by the majority which comes from Lord
Denning, M.R. in Wiltshire v. Barrett, [1965] 2 All E.R. 271 at pp.
273-74.

The Trial Judge’s Test

I have already set out earlier the passages of
his judgment where he enunciates the test. He had originally laid down the test
correctly (“The peace officer must have come to the conclusion that any
ordinary person (the average man) would have made the same deduction in the
same circumstances.”) but then erred in law by applying to the accused
arresting officer the test the minority of this Court in Biron would
have applied when trying the person resisting arrest, when he said:

[TRANSLATION] Based on these events, which
occurred on the ramp leading to the bridge, it must be proven that Roger Chassé
committed a criminal offence.

This error of law provided grounds for the Court
of Queen’s Bench to substitute its findings of fact on that issue. The Court of
Appeal was bound by that finding, as will be this Court, if the Court of
Queen’s Bench applied the proper test.

The Court of Queen’s Bench Test

That Court stated the test as follows:

The question is not whether the accused in
fact had reasonable and probable grounds but whether he honest-

[Page 326]

ly believed he had the reasonable and
probable grounds to justify his course of action.

With respect, though closer to the proper test
than the trial judge, the Court erred by introducing into the test the
availability of a putative justification that Stuart, (Don Stuart, Canadian
Criminal Law, 1982, Carswell, Toronto) defines as, at p. 381:

…situations where the accused genuinely
believed that his act was justified in law but, on the facts as he believed
them to be, no such legal justification existed.

I agree with Stuart’s further comments on the
subject where he says (at pp. 381-82):

Consider the case of a police officer who
genuinely but totally unreasonably believes that he can do anything with legal
impunity if his primary aim is to enforce the law. The law has always placed a
limitation in the form of a test of reasonableness. The law must continue to
distinguish this area of justifications as a particularly delicate area in
which value choices have to be reflected and in which some objectivity is
inevitable. Our present law of justifications does not admit of any concept of
putative justification41, It is often recognized that the situation
must be judged on the facts perceived by the accused, usually on reasonable
grounds, but this is quite different from the assertion that both the facts and
law must be judged on the accused’s perception.

41 In Parrot (1979) 51 C.C.C. (2d) 539
at 545-46 (Ont. C.A.) (leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused
at 51 C.C.C. (2d) 539n (S.C.C.)) it was expressly held that a mistaken belief
as to one’s legal obligation does not constitute a lawful excuse.

The Court of Appeal having not made its own finding
on the issue, though entitled to do so because of that error of law on the part
of the Court of Queen’s Bench, it is now incumbent upon this Court to do so.

Having read the record, I am of the view that,
under the circumstances of this case, constable Roberge’s assessment of the
situation to the effect that Mr. Chassé was committing the criminal
offence of dangerous driving was made on reasonable and probable grounds (i.e.,
Mr. Chassé would

[Page 327]

have appeared to a reasonable person, placed in the
same circumstances, to be committing that offence).

To arrive at this conclusion I take care not to
try the issue as if Mr. Chassé was on trial for dangerous driving, as I
suspect, from reading his judgment, the trial judge might have done. When
determining what the constable saw, and when weighing the evidence, any
contradiction giving rise to a reasonable doubt must inure to the benefit of
the accused who is, as might be easily forgotten, in this case, the police
officer. Mr. Chassé is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt
when tried for that offence, but equally so is constable Roberge when he sits
in the prisoner’s dock.

Therefore, the contradictions in the evidence
between Mr. Chassé and constable Roberge as to what happened, which might
well be properly resolved in Chassé’s favour at his trial, I resolved here in
Roberge’s favour.

I took, as I am bound to, the trial judge’s
narrative of the facts which should be completed by adding the following which,
in my view, tend to support Roberge’s version of what he saw at the bridge and
which is not contested.

Mr. Chassé admitted to having had a couple
of beers in the morning around 10 o’clock. The purchase made in Quebec was a
case of beer and some cheese. Chassé, after driving away with a punctured tire
and having abandoned his car on the Trans-Canada Highway, took a taxi home,
carting with him his case of beer. A neighbour’s daughter, one Suzanne McGrath,
saw him get out of the taxi carting his case of beer and stated:

[TRANSLATION]

Q. Did you notice anything else?

A. Yes, he was carrying a case of beer. I
thought he had been drinking from the way he was walking.

Q. I assume you have seen Mr. Chassé
walk on other occasions?

A. Yes.

Q. I have no further questions.

[Page 328]

Chassé’s son, Claude, said the R.C.M.P. arrived
at their house some fifteen minutes after his father. He and his mother advised
Chassé not to give a statement but rather to go to bed because they thought he
had too much to drink. These facts, though not conclusive, are relevant as
supporting the accused’s version as to the kind of driving he witnessed at the
entrance of the bridge. His driving after crossing the bridge is also
supportive of that prior to crossing. True, he explains it as resulting from
fear, alleging that he did not know Roberge was a Quebec police officer. But
any doubt as to the truthfulness of this explanation must be resolved in favour
of Roberge. Chassé did not use his radio to call for help, he only used it when
he was on the Trans-Canada Highway, with a punctured tire, to call a taxi to go
home, carting his case of beer. He did not go to the police. Prior to the
puncturing of his tire, he drove through the intersections of Arran and
Minto streets; had he turned right he could have gone to the taxi stand, or
left, and he would be at the R.C.M.P. station. His explanation as to why he did
not in this way take refuge from Roberge is, to say the least, nebulous.
Witness the following passage of his testimony:

[TRANSLATION]

Q. I see—you were upset, you were afraid.
Now when you saw this fellow leave the bridge and follow you, and you got to
the intersection of Water, or rather Roseberry, and Subway, if you had
turned left, wouldn’t that have taken you to the R.C.M.P. station?

A. Yes.

Q. It was nearby?

A. If I turned right it would take me to
the stand. If I turned left it would take me to the police station.

Q. Yes. Why didn’t you go to either of
these places?

A. I was going to the stand, but there were
too many cars behind me, there were cars behind, and when I saw that, I cut
away, that is when I cut away and took Minto.

Q. I see.

A. There were other cars.

[Page 329]

Q. But you were going to go to the stand?

A. I was no longer on that side.

Q. Okay. Then you did not think of going to
the police station?

A. I did not think of going to the police
station, the road was right there.

Q. Yes, but you were being pursued by a
maniac, you were afraid, you were upset: the best place in the world to go was
the police station.

A. The taxi stand was good also.

Q. The stand was good also.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. But you did not go there?

A. There were cars, and as a result—

Q. There were cars, okay. When you went
onto Minto Street and came to the intersection of Arran and Minto, if you
turned to the left it would take you to another police station close by?

A. A little further on, yes.

Q. A little, but not very far.

A. No.

Q. R.C.M.P. County Detachment, wasn’t it?

A. (Inaudible).

Q. Yes. But you didn’t think of going
there: that would have been a good place to go.

A. I was going home.

Q. Pardon?

A. I was going home.

Q. What kind of action could have been
taken at home, sir, that a dozen members of the R.C.M.P. who were sitting there
in their station could not give you? What greater protection did you have at
home?

A. I was at home, okay?

Q. If you were afraid that some kind of
maniac was following you, instead of going home would you not have had better
protection by making a left turn and going to the police station?

A. Yes, that would have been a good idea.

Q. Why didn’t you go there? You wanted to
go home?

A. Yes.

His explanation as to the siren is as nebulous
as that regarding his not going to the police. Finally, it is difficult to
accept that a taxi driver of long experience, who is called upon to drive
customers

[Page 330]

to the Quebec side and who, living on the
border, goes frequently to Quebec for personal reasons, as he did in this case
to buy beer, does not recognize the uniform of the Quebec Police Force.

As a result, I agree with the Court of Queen’s
Bench Justice, sitting on appeal, that Roberge had reasonable and probable
grounds to believe that Chassé was committing the offence of dangerous driving,
and that he therefore started his chase in Quebec qua a peace officer
with the protection afforded him under s. 25(4).

The next question we must then deal with is
whether at the time he used his gun in New Brunswick he still had the
protection of s. 25(4) as he is not a peace officer under the laws of New
Brunswick, and he was not assisting a peace officer of that province. This question
is of some importance, as the protection afforded an arresting citizen under
s. 25(1) is, by s. 25(3), much more limited than that under
s. 25(4). Furthermore, whatever is justified for the purpose of making an
arrest under s. 25(1) is in itself, quite apart from the limitations set
out in s. 25(3), somewhat more limited than what is justified “to prevent
the escape by flight” in order “to avoid arrest”.

Angers J., of the Court of Queen’s Bench, relied
on R. v. Shyffer, supra, and concluded that he still was a peace
officer. That case is of little help. Clement J., of the Supreme Court of
British Columbia, seems to have taken as being the law applicable to his case,
as it had been conceded by the parties, that (at p. 192) “the police of
one province can arrest without warrant a person charged with having committed
a crime in another province only where the crime is one for which the accused
could have been arrested without warrant in the province where the crime was
committed, or where the accused is escaping fresh pursuit: Criminal Code 
ss. 30 , 33  and 649 .”

[Page 331]

The difference between s. 649  of the Criminal
Code  in 1910 and s. 449(1)(b) of today’s Code are, for
the purpose of the question we are now considering, of no consequence.

649. Any one
may arrest without warrant a person whom he, on reasonable and probable
grounds, believes to have committed a criminal offence and to be escaping from,
and to be freshly pursued by, those whom the person arresting, on reasonable
and probable grounds, believes to have lawful authority to arrest such person.

That section did not (nor does today’s
s. 449(1)(b)) support the proposition advanced in Shyffer.
I have searched to no avail for authority on the matter. In any event, my
view is that, in a country such as ours, where there are over 15,000 kilometres
of interprovincial and territorial frontiers, it is unreasonable to make so
drastic a variance in the protection afforded our police officers under
s. 25 when they are in pursuit of a criminal (most pursuits often involve
crimes more heinous than the one under consideration in this case) dependent
solely upon the officer crossing a border. True, a mistaken belief on the part
of the officer that he is still within his province will afford him the
protection of s. 25(4). On the other hand, even if he does know he has
changed provinces, it is in my view, seriously and unnecessarily hampering
police work to reduce a peace officer to the rank of an ordinary citizen and to
limit, by taking away part of his protection under s. 25, through a
variation of the nature and purpose of what he is authorized to do, the force
he is entitled to use dependent upon his moving a few feet further in pursuit
of a criminal.

Under s. 25(1), the purpose is to arrest,
while under s. 25(4) the purpose is to prevent escape from immediate
arrest. As I have already said, this difference of purpose has a direct bearing
on the nature of the force the reasonableness of which is to be assessed.

This case, where Chassé could have been easily
arrested later on in the day using the licence plates of the taxi he was
driving to identify him provides an illustration. As a citizen, if such were
Roberge’s status, he would not have (except if he were assisting a peace
officer) been justified in the circumstances resorting to any force, and his
course of

[Page 332]

action would have been to report the matter to
the local police. Arrest did not require carrying on the dangerous pursuit, let
alone using a revolver to immobilize the car. As a peace officer, if that be
his status, immediate arrest justified his persistence in the pursuit and the
eventual use of his revolver as a final resort to immobilize the car. I cannot
accept that the policy considerations that brought about s. 25(4) should
be defeated by placing the police officer in jeopardy upon the mere crossing of
a provincial border. The policy might be more easily understood had Chassé been
found driving a getaway car after committing a hold-up; or, upon arriving at
home, had he reported his car stolen and denied he had been driving it,
specially so if the car had been involved in a hit and run incident where a
pedestrian was killed. Indeed, immediate arrest, and the need for pursuit as a
means to that end are essential to policy considerations that should not be
defeated by stripping peace officers in the middle of a chase of their
protection under s. 25(4).

I would therefore find that as a matter of law a
peace officer who had lawful authority to arrest a person under s. 450  in
one province and is pursuing that person, retains, for the purpose of
s. 25(4), his status of a peace officer in another province inasmuch as
the pursuit had commenced lawfully in his jurisdiction and as long as such
pursuit is fresh.

I would add one reservation.

The police officer should endeavour to contact
the local peace officers as soon as is possible, even during the pursuit,
circumstances permitting. Once the local authorities have taken over the
pursuit, he ceases to be a peace officer and becomes then a person assisting
peace officers under s. 449(1)(b), and, as such, will continue
enjoying the protection of s. 25(4).

This, to me, seems a desirable temporary
extension of his peace officer status which logically fills

[Page 333]

in a gap between the time when he would
otherwise cease to be a peace officer and when he becomes a person assisting
peace officers.

Angers J. was in my view right in law when
assessing the reasonableness of Roberge’s use of his firearm. In making his
assessment on the facts of the case, he found that the force resorted to under
the circumstances was not excessive, which by implication means that the force
had become “necessary to prevent the escape by flight” and that “the escape
[could not] be prevented by reasonable means in a less violent manner”. That
finding is one of fact with which this Court cannot and should not interfere,
unless we find that his conclusion is unreasonable and cannot be supported by
the evidence, keeping in mind that this Court is limited to matters of law. His
conclusion could be said to be unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence as
a matter of law only if we find that there is no evidence upon which such a
finding could reasonably be made. This is clearly not the case. Roberge had
more than once attempted to stop the car by signalling, activating his siren,
overtaking and blocking the car with his own, all to no avail. Furthermore, the
escalation of force resorted to was not disproportionate to that of the
suspicion Chassé must have created in Roberge’s mind as he persisted in his
flight notwithstanding all those warnings. He behaved, especially after the
warning shots, as if risking being shot was better for him than what might be
discovered if apprehended. Roberge’s conduct must be assessed in the light of
the state of mind of a reasonable person reacting not to what was discovered
after the incident but to what Chassé’s conduct in escaping suggested might be
discovered upon immediate arrest. Short of requiring that he give up immediate
arrest and opt for eventual arrest, an alternative he needed not in
law revert to, I am unable to say that there is no evidence upon which the
judge could predicate his finding that the means resorted to by Roberge for an
immediate arrest were not excessive. Furthermore, during the chase he had,
using his radio, contacted the Quebec Police Station and requested that the
R.C.M.P. in New Brunswick be alerted. When Chassé drove off with the punctured
tire, constable Roberge, on his way to the R.C.M.P. station, saw an officer of
that

[Page 334]

force and immediately reported the incident to
him.

A final observation. I should not want my
comments in support of the policy considerations that justify, in my opinion, a
distinction being made under s. 25(1) and s. 25(4), by which I extend
temporarily a peace officer’s status, to be considered as being in any way a
comment supporting or taking exception to the wide powers given peace officers
in dealing with flight from arrest under s. 25(4). Section 25(4) is a
codification of the old common law applicable to fleeing felons, offenders that
would in those days, if found guilty, most certainly be executed. Many
suggestions have been made to Parliament as regards this frightful arsenal
peace officers enjoy (see, amongst others, the Ouimet Committee Report),
particularly concerning offences that do not indicate dangerousness on the
part of the offender, such as shoplifting, fraud, gambling. We have extended to
all indictable offences a common law principle that was intended to be applied
only to felons. This is a choice Parliament has made and which the courts
cannot defeat.

To conclude, I would therefore allow the appeal,
quash the Court of Appeal’s judgment and restore the acquittal entered by the
Court of Queen’s Bench.

commit fraud. There was no valid proof of his guilt aside from a confession
made by respondent to the police when he was being detained prior to his trial.
This confession was obtained after respondent was denied the right to consult a
lawyer. At trial, after a voir-dire the judge held the confession was
admissible because it was free and voluntary. On appeal, a majority of the
Court of Appeal rejected the findings of the trial judge, and ruled that the
repeated refusal of the police to allow the accused to consult a lawyer made
his fear that he would not be released until he had signed a statement
credible, and left room for a reasonable doubt as to the free and voluntary
nature of the confession.

Held: The
appeal should be quashed.

Per Estey,
Mclntyre, Lamer and Wilson JJ.: In light of the evidence and the actions of the
police, the judges of appeal could have had doubts not countenanced by the
trial judge. The majority’s difference of opinion with the trial judge and with
their brother on the Court of Appeal—who concurred with the view of the lower
court as to the effect which the repeated refusals of the police might have had
in the circumstances—was not such as to raise a question of law.

Per Dickson,
Beetz and Chouinard JJ.: This appeal did not raise a question of law. For this
reason, it should be quashed.

English version of the reasons of Dickson, Beetz

CHOUINARD J.—Like Lamer J., I am of the opinion
that this appeal does not raise a question of law. For this reason, it should
be quashed.

English version of the judgment of Estey,
Mclntyre, Lamer and Wilson JJ. delivered by

LAMER J.—Luc Turgeon was convicted by a judge of
the Provincial Court of Quebec of the crime of conspiracy to commit fraud.

The Court of Appeal by a majority judgment
allowed his appeal and acquitted him: hence the appeal by the Crown to this
Court.

One component of the prosecution evidence is a
confession by respondent, which the trial judge held, following the holding of
a voir-dire, was admissible because it was made freely and voluntarily.
Two of the three judges of the Court of Appeal came to the opposite conclusion.
The confession was not admitted and the accused was acquitted. At the hearing
of the appeal before this Court, the Crown conceded that unless this confession
was in evidence the accused had to be acquitted. The Crown admitted that on two
occasions the police denied the accused the right to telephone a lawyer and
consult him, and that the statement was obtained from the accused after these
refusals.

Both Judge Bigué of the Provincial Court and
Dubé J.A. made clear and thorough analyses of the various decisions of this
Court and of the other Canadian superior courts regarding the effect of a
flagrant denial of the rights of an inmate, recognized by the Canadian Bill
of Rights, on the admissibility in evidence of a statement. It should be
mentioned that, at the time of the trial, the appeal, and above all, the
decision of this Court to authorize the appeal, Canada did not yet have the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The
coming into force of the Charter  now greatly diminishes the importance this
appeal had at the time, namely that it provided this Court with an

[Page 310]

opportunity to review the rule as to the
admissibility of statements under such circumstances.

Judge Bigué found that the actions of the police
officers, in denying Turgeon access to counsel, did not in any way affect the
free and voluntary nature of the statement. The ratio decidendi of the
majority decision of the Court of Appeal is stated by Mayrand J.A. as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The circumstances in which
the incriminating statement was made and signed by the accused leave room for a
reasonable doubt as to its voluntariness.

One of the significant circumstances is the
repeated refusal of the police to allow the accused to consult a lawyer before
being interrogated(10). This illegal refusal(11) created
an atmosphere of coercion that makes the fear the accused said he felt of
not being able to be released until he had signed the statement credible.

I concur in this regard in the view of my
brother Dubé J.A. and would dispose of the appeal as suggested by him.

(10)See
as to this F. Kaufman, The Admissibility of Confessions, 3rd ed., Toronto, Carswell, 1979, pp. 160-178.

(11)Canadian
Bill of Rights, s. 2(c)(i).

(Emphasis added.)

Dubé J.A. had concluded as follows:

[TRANSLATION] It is easy to say that Luc
Turgeon was in no way forced to make a statement, but he told this Court
that the police officers gave him to understand that he would not be released
until he had made a confession: it does not matter whether the police used
exactly these words; it seems to me, at least in my opinion, that the simple
fact that Turgeon was denied permission to see a lawyer until he had made a
statement meant it would be better to make such a statement. How can there be
no reasonable doubt in these circumstances, when Luc Turgeon stated that he
felt he had to make a statement?

(Emphasis added.)

In light of the evidence and the actions of the
police, it was open to the judges of appeal to entertain doubts not
countenanced by the trial judge. This difference of opinion of the majority in
the Court of Appeal with the trial judge and with

[Page 311]

their brother on the Court of Appeal, Turgeon
J.A., who concurred with the lower court, as to the effect which these refusals
might have had in the circumstances, is not such as to raise a question of law.
Earlier in his opinion, Dubé J.A. had enunciated the following rule:
[TRANSLATION] “… where a person in authority categorically denies an accused
his undisputed right to get in touch with a lawyer without unreasonable delay,
a confession obtained in such circumstances should not be accepted since it is
practically impossible for it to have been made freely and voluntarily, even if
this appears to have been the case”. In fact, in the case at bar respondent had
testified that he felt, as a result of the actions of the police, that he had
to make a confession in order to be released. On this point, Dubé J.A. gave him
the benefit of the doubt. The fact that Mayrand J.A. only concurred in the
reasons of his brother as to that conclusion places the rule proposed by Dubé
J.A. in the category of an obiter dictum.

For these reasons, I would quash this appeal.

Appeal quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ALBERTA

Criminal law—Defences—Self-defence—Use of
excessive force—Charge to jury—Whether use of excessive force in self-defence
reducing murder to manslaughter—Whether trial judge failed to instruct jury on
manslaughter—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 34, 37, 212.

Criminal
law—Defences—Provocation—Provocation not raised by defence—Charge to
jury—Whether trial judge erred in failing to instruct jury as to
provocation—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 215.

The Alberta Court of Appeal set aside
respondent’s conviction and ordered a new trial. It held that the trial judge
did not adequately instruct the jury on a possible verdict of manslaughter
arising from “excessive use of force” in self-defence and from provocation.
This appeal is to determine whether the trial judge erred in failing to
instruct the jury on these issues.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Where a killing resulted from the use of
excessive force in self-defence the accused loses the justification provided
under s. 34 of the Code and the defence of self-defence fails. It
does not follow automatically that the verdict must be murder. Unless it is
shown that the killing was accompanied by the intent required under
s. 212(a) of the Code, it remains a killing without intent, i.e.
manslaughter. Here, the difference between murder and manslaughter was
properly explained to the jury. In any event, where lack of intent to cause
grievous bodily harm is not even argued, the failure to repeat the murder/manslaughter
distinction cannot constitute an error. As to the second issue, the trial judge
rightly decided to refrain from putting the defence of provoca-

[Page 266]

tion to the jury. There was no evidence
produced on which a jury could decide that the accused acted out of sudden
provocation, killing in the “heat of passion”, as required by s. 215 of
the Code.

[1981] 5 W.W.R. 349, 61 C.C.C. (2d) 28, 30 A.R. 616, setting aside respondent’s

Jack Watson, for the appellant.

A. Clayton Rice, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The question presented is whether the
trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury as to a possible verdict of
manslaughter arising from (i) “excessive use of force” in self‑defence,
(ii) provocation.

I

The respondent, Donald Faid, was charged that he
did unlawfully murder Robert Wilson and did thereby commit first degree murder.
He was tried before judge and jury, convicted of second degree murder and
sentenced to imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole until he had
served 13 years of this sentence. On appeal, the Court of Appeal of Alberta,
speaking through Harradence J.A., set aside the conviction and ordered a new
trial on the charge of second degree murder ([1981] 5 W.W.R. 349). The Court
held that the

[Page 267]

charge of the trial judge was exemplary in
dealing with the issue of justification of the use of force in self-defence but
that the judge had failed to direct the jury on the question of manslaughter if
the accused lost the absolute shield of justification through “excessive use of
force”, and this non-direction amounted to misdirection. The Court held further
that although counsel for Faid had not presented the defence of provocation, it
was the duty of the trial judge to place before the jury any defence reasonably
raised by the evidence. In the view of Harradence J.A., speaking for the Court,
there was evidence warranting a charge on provocation (at pp. 357-58):

Where the potential for a verdict of
manslaughter exists, the jury must be given the opportunity of considering that
verdict and the defence upon which it rests. Even where the circumstances of
the case indicate that a verdict of manslaughter based upon provocation seems
improbable, (as in this instance, where the testimony of the accused suggested
that he stabbed the accused [sic] to prevent him obtaining
another weapon), the issue of manslaughter must still be put to the jury.

II

The Evidence

The evidence disclosed that Wilson and Faid were
involved in the sale of drugs, that Wilson had threatened Faid and Wilson had a violent temper. Following a party at which Faid was informed
that Wilson was going to put a
“contract” out on him Faid returned to the trailer he shared with Wilson. When he arrived Wilson was asleep. At approximately 1:00
p.m. Wilson awoke and went into
the living room where Faid was sitting. Both men were in bathing suits. During
the conversation which followed, Faid inquired whether Wilson had put out, or was going to put out, a “contract” on him.
According to Faid he started to leave but Wilson blocked his way. The evidence of Faid as to what occurred
thereafter may be summarized as follows. Wilson hit Faid twice on the side of the head. Faid

[Page 268]

hit Wilson and Wilson fell over a coffee table. Wilson got up with a long-bladed boning
knife in his hand. Where the knife came from was not clear from the evidence. Wilson came toward Faid. Faid gave Wilson a “side kick”. Wilson fell back onto a chesterfield. Faid
grabbed a crescent wrench from the top of a television set. The wrench had been
used for changing the television channels as the channel selector was missing.
Faid hit Wilson on the back of
the head a number of times with the wrench, trying to knock Wilson out. The wrench slipped from Faid’s
hand. Faid then tried to grab Wilson’s hand which held the knife. Faid was on
top of Wilson on the chesterfield. After further struggle Faid got the knife
from Wilson and told Wilson “there was no need to go on, because I had the
knife and as far as I was concerned, the fight should have ended”. Wilson was
growling like an animal, trying to get up. Faid noticed a spear gun on the far
side of the chesterfield. In Faid’s words “it appeared to me that he was going
for that, he was trying to get up, and that was when I stabbed him. I stabbed
him to stop him. I was afraid that if he got loose he was going to kill me… I
stabbed him again and he fell to the floor, and the next thing I remember, I
was standing in the kitchen. I don’t remember stabbing him a third time”.
Wilson was dead. He had been stabbed three times in the back. No spear gun was
found or noted to be in the trailer when the police went there. Faid testified
he had acted in self-defence. His examination-in-chief ended with this passage:

Well, all I can say is that I never wanted
to kill him. I only stabbed him to stop him. At the time I did what I thought I
had to do and if I had a chance to do the same thing over again, I would still
have to react and to—maiming him to protect my life, because as far as I was
concerned, there was no other alternative that I could have used, just to stop
what he was trying to do. Only, as I look at it, it was very foolish of me to
try to hide things, especially burning the body. I don’t feel that I have
committed first degree murder, a murder of any sort, the only thing I can see I
am guilty of is trying to

[Page 269]

stay alive, and I don’t feel that I should
die in prison. That’s all I can say.

Following the killing Faid tried to remove any
trace of the event. He rented a “Rug Doctor” to clean the blood from the rug,
he took the chesterfield to the local dump, burned certain articles in the burn
barrel, disposed of the knife and wrench along a highway, and, finally, took
Wilson’s body to a country road, covered it with gasoline and set it ablaze. He
said that he was trying to “hide all things that were involved with this”.

Some two weeks later Faid was arrested for drug
trafficking. He gave a number of inconsistent statements, obviously intended to
mislead the police and later made a number of admissions as to relevant facts.
One of the police officers testified that Faid made the comment “He ripped me
off, he ripped everybody off, the fucker deserved it”. At trial, Faid denied
making this remark.

Faid was described by one of the police
witnesses as being 6 feet 3 inches tall and perhaps 240 pounds. He put himself
at 6 feet and 225 pounds. Two of the witnesses described Wilson as 5 feet 8½
inches tall, and 155 pounds, according to one witness, or 170 pounds according
to the other witness. Faid said that Wilson was roughly an inch shorter than
himself and that Wilson wore size 34 pants to his own size 38. A fingerprint
form entered as an exhibit recorded Wilson’s height and weight at 5 feet 10
inches, 190 pounds.

The theory of the Crown was that Faid
deliberately killed Wilson in order to resolve a dispute over money which had
arisen earlier. The theory of the defence was self-defence. Addressing the jury
prior to calling defence evidence counsel for the defence said:

The defence here, so you understand, is the
defence of self-defence, that the killing of Mr. Wilson by Donald Faid was
done in self-defence.

The two main issues left to the jury were (i)
whether Faid killed Wilson with the intent con-

[Page 270]

templated in s. 212  of the Criminal Code 
and (ii) whether Faid was legitimately acting in self‑defence. The
jury resolved both issues adversely to Faid.

III

Excessive Use of Force in Self-Defence

It was, as I have said, the view of the Court of
Appeal that a manslaughter verdict was open in circumstances where an accused
used excessive force in self-defence. In such circumstances an accused might
lose the absolute shield of justification entitling him to an acquittal
pursuant to s. 34 of the Code but he would not be guilty of murder.
The “half-way house” shelter of manslaughter was available to him. The Court
followed two earlier decisions of the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v.
Fraser (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 503 and R. v. Gee (1980), 55 C.C.C.
(2d) 525.

In R. v. Brisson, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 227,
this Court had occasion to consider whether a jury should find an accused
guilty only of manslaughter, and not murder, if they found the accused had used
excessive force in defending himself. The result was indecisive.
Mr. Justice Beetz, Mr. Justice Chouinard and Mr. Justice Lamer
shared my view that there is no special rule to the effect that death caused by
the use of excessive force in self-defence can only be manslaughter, though the
facts on which the defence of self-defence was unsuccessfully sought to be
based may in some cases go to show that the defendant acted under provocation
or that, although acting unlawfully, he lacked the intent to kill or cause
grievous bodily harm. In such cases a verdict of manslaughter would be proper.
In Brisson the Chief Justice, with whom Mr. Justice Ritchie agreed,
was of opinion that there was no evidence upon which the trial judge could have
left to the jury the issue of self-defence, let alone any issue of excessive
self-defence as a basis for a verdict of manslaughter. Mr. Justice
McIntyre, with whom Justices Martland and Estey agreed, in separate

[Page 271]

reasons, expressed a similar view.

In Brisson I sought to explain why, in my
opinion, a verdict of manslaughter, except in the circumstances to which I have
earlier alluded, is not available where an accused acting in self-defence, as
described in s. 34 of the Code, causes a death by the use of an
excess of force. I am still of that opinion. The position of the Alberta Court
of Appeal that there is a “half‑way” house outside s. 34 of the Code
is, in my view, inapplicable to the Canadian codified system of criminal
law, it lacks any recognizable basis in principle, would require prolix and
complicated jury charges and would encourage juries to reach compromise
verdicts to the prejudice of either the accused or the Crown. Where a killing
has resulted from the excessive use of force in self-defence the accused loses
the justification provided under s. 34. There is no partial justification
open under the section. Once the jury reaches the conclusion that excessive
force has been used the defence of self-defence has failed. It does not follow
automatically, however, that the verdict must be murder. The accused has become
responsible for a killing. He has no justification on the basis of
self-defence, but unless it is shown that the killing was accompanied by the
intent required under s. 212(a) of the Code, it remains a
killing without intent, in other words manslaughter. If the jury considers that
excessive force has been used, and has resulted in a death, they must then ask
themselves whether the accused in causing the killing possessed the intent
described in s. 212(a) of the Code, that is, an intent to
kill or cause bodily harm likely to cause death. If they are satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the intent was present, they should find the accused
guilty of murder. However, in the event they found no such intent existed, or
had a doubt as to its existence, they should convict of manslaughter. This
conviction would rest upon the fact that an unlawful killing had been committed
without the intent required to make it murder under s. 212 (a).

[Page 272]

After instructing the jury with respect to the
elements of the justification provided by s. 34(2) the trial judge said:

If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt on all the evidence that the accused did not kill Wilson in circumstance
which conform with any of the situations of self-defence in law, as I have
explained them, then the Crown has proved that the blows with the wrench and
the knife by Faid against Wilson were not justified. In that event, the defence
of self-defence is not available to the accused.

Earlier in the charge the trial judge explained
the difference between murder and manslaughter in these terms:

Now if you cannot find that Faid has the
intent required for murder as I have explained it to you, then you may find
that he is guilty of manslaughter and not murder.

It may be that the trial judge’s charge to the
jury would have been better for expressly pointing out, after outlining the
elements of the s. 34(2) defence, that a verdict of murder does not
automatically follow a finding that the s. 34(2) defence is unavailable because
the accused used excessive force in self-defence. The trial judge might then
have explained that the jury could convict of either murder or manslaughter,
depending upon their finding as to the presence or absence of the intents
required to be proved by s. 212 (a). In my opinion, however,
the failure to repeat the murder/manslaughter distinction does not constitute
error. The only defence put forward in this case was self-defence. Faid denied
that he intended to kill Wilson; understandably, however, he did not contend
that in stabbing Wilson in the back three times, he did not intend to cause
bodily harm likely to cause death. Indeed, he admitted “I did what I thought I
had to do… maiming him to protect my life”. The jury found Faid guilty of
murder. The difference between murder and manslaughter was properly explained
to them. The jury evidently concluded that Faid intended to kill or cause
bodily harm likely to cause death. Indeed, the facts in this case permit no
other conclusion. In my opinion the result would be the same no matter how
often the trial judge repeated the murder manslaughter distinction. In any
event, where lack of intent to cause grievous bodily harm is not even

[Page 273]

argued, it cannot be error for the trial judge
to fail to repeat, for the sake of emphasis, that unintentional killing is
manslaughter, but not murder.

I add this observation. The suggestion that the
trial judge’s charge might have been improved by repeating the
murder/manslaughter distinction might seem reasonable because of the uncertain
state of the law, after Brisson, with respect to the availability of a
manslaughter verdict where a s. 34 defence fails only because the accused
employed excessive force in defending himself. Uncertainty as to the
availability of a verdict of manslaughter on this basis might have made it
desirable, perhaps, to indicate unequivocally that manslaughter is available,
and is the proper verdict, where proof of intentional killing is lacking. But
the uncertainty that makes this clarification helpful exists in the minds of
lawyers steeped in Brisson and like cases, not in the minds of jurors.
This jury was told that intentional killing was murder, and that unintentional
killing was manslaughter. They found Faid guilty of murder. I see no reason for
suspecting that the jury could have convicted for murder while harbouring any
reasonable doubt as to intent.

A final point: in explaining s. 34(2) to
the jury the trial judge made the following observation:

…even if the accused intended to cause death
or grievous bodily harm, his actions may have been justified as self-defence
under Section 34(2)  of the Criminal Code .

Two interpretations of s. 34(2)  are
possible: (i) the one taken by the trial judge, namely, that s. 34(2) 
provides a justification against an intentional killing done in self-defence;
and (ii) that s. 34(2)  is not applicable in an intentional killing
situation,

[Page 274]

and provides no defence to an intentional
killing, because the purpose of the section is to justify force which would
otherwise be unlawful, the force so justified being the force referred to in
s. 34(1), namely, a force not intended to cause death or grievous bodily
harm likely to cause death. It may be that the trial judge’s interpretation is
the correct one, when one reads s. 34(2)  together with s. 37 of the Code.
It is not necessary to decide the point in this case, however, because even
if the trial judge’s interpretation is erroneous, the error worked to Faid’s
advantage, insofar as this interpretation of s. 34(2)  made the defence
therein provided available to Faid, which it would not be if the other
interpretation is the correct one.

With respect, I conclude that the Court of
Appeal of Alberta erred in finding misdirection in the failure of the judge at
trial to instruct the jury that they could bring in a verdict of manslaughter
if they found that s. 34 was not available to the accused by reason of
excessive use of force.

IV

Provocation

It is commonplace that the fact that an accused
does not raise a defence does not relieve the trial judge from the duty of
putting the matter before the jury, where there are facts in evidence for the
jury to consider. In the case at bar counsel for the accused did not raise
provocation as a defence. Indeed the record would indicate that he deliberately
refrained from doing so. At the conclusion of the charge the court asked
counsel whether he had any comments about the charge. The record reads:

Mr. Barker: No, my Lord. Well I wonder
if you might—you brought manslaughter to their attention, but I am wondering if
you might also point out manslaughter in relation to provocation, and the two
blows, evidence of the two blows struck by Mr. Wilson upon Mr. Faid.
As I recall you opened the possibility of manslaughter to them based upon—

[Page 275]

The Court: Faid did not—

Mr. Barker: Possess the necessary
intention. That would be plain to them, but there is the evidence and I didn’t
bring it in my charge for a very good reason, and if I may rely on the Court to
do that if you see fit, based on the two blows that were struck by
Mr. Wilson, according to Mr. Faid. I would ask that you do that,
otherwise I have no further submission to make.

The Court: Thank you.

The judge declined to recall the jury stating,
in respect of the foregoing, and in respect of the points raised by Crown
counsel:

The Court: Gentlemen, I have the view that
when the jury is charged that they assimilate better the total effect, the
impact of the explanations and the reviews than in circumstances when they are
brought back; and although I think there may be some merit in the particular
points raised, but taking the matter in balance it is my view that I will not
re-call the jury, and the charge will stand.

Provocation as a defence to a charge of murder
in Canada is governed by s. 215 (1) , (2)  and (3)  of the Criminal Code  which
provides as follows:

215. (1)
Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to manslaughter
if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden
provocation.

(2) A wrongful act or insult that is of
such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section if the
accused acted upon it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion
to cool.

(3) For the purposes of this
section the questions

(a) whether a particular wrongful
act or insult amounted to provocation, and

(b) whether the accused was deprived
of the power of self-control by the provocation that he alleges he received,

are questions of fact, but no one shall be
deemed to have given provocation to another by doing anything that he had a
legal right to do, or by doing anything that the accused incited him to do in
order to provide the accused with an excuse for causing death or bodily harm to
any human being.

The law, properly in my view, recognizes a
lesser degree of culpability in a person who is provoked to the extent of
losing his self-control and who kills

[Page 276]

in the heat of passion. It was pointed out by
Viscount Simon, however, in Mancini v. Director of Public Prosecutions (1941),
28 Cr. App. R. 65, at p. 74 that “It is not all provocation that will
reduce the crime of murder to manslaughter. Provocation, to have that result
must be such as temporarily deprives the person provoked of the power of
self-control, as the result of which he commits the unlawful act which causes
death.” As Rand J. said in R. v. Tripodi, [1955] S.C.R. 438, at
p. 443:

What s. 261 of the Code [now
s. 215] provides for is “sudden provocation”, and it must be acted upon by
the accused “on the sudden and before there has been time for his passion to
cool”. “Suddenness” must characterize both the insult and the act of
retaliation. The question here is whether there was any evidence on which the
jury, acting judicially, could find the existence of “sudden provocation”.

I take that expression to mean that the
wrongful act or insult must strike upon a mind unprepared for it, that it must
make an unexpected impact that takes the understanding by surprise and sets the
passions aflame. What was there of that here?

There are two key elements to a defence of
provocation reducing what would otherwise be culpable murder to manslaughter.
The person causing death must have done so (i) in the “heat of passion”, caused
by (ii) “sudden provocation”. Whether the accused was provoked to lose his
self-control is a question of fact for the jury. Where an accused testifies
that he killed impulsively in hot blood it must be left to the jury to decide
whether he is to be believed or not. There is, however, the preliminary
question to be decided by the judge as a question of law, namely, whether there
was any evidence produced on which a jury could decide that the accused acted
in the heat of passion. The question as to whether or not there is any evidence
is for the court, but subject to that the following matters are both questions
of fact for the jury, namely, (i) the sufficiency of the particular wrongful
act or insult to cause an ordinary person to be deprived of self-control, and
(ii) whether the accused was actually deprived of his

[Page 277]

self-control by such act or insult: per Kellock
J. in Taylor v. The King, [1947] S.C.R. 462, at p. 472.

Professor Glanville Williams in his Textbook
of Criminal Law (1978), at p. 480, makes the point that in order to
have the defence of provocation the defendant must have killed because he was
provoked, not merely because provocation existed. There must be a causal
connection between the provocation and the killing.

As the Court of Appeal of Alberta stated in its
judgment in the case at bar, the nature of the evidence required to leave the
defence of provocation with the jury was set down by this Court in Parnerkar
v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 449, approved by the full Court in R. v.
Squire, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 13. In Parnerkar Fauteux C.J. said (at
p. 454):

The function assigned to the jury with
respect to the particular facts mentioned in s. 203(3) [now
s. 215(3) ] does not in any way differ from the function they have to
decide all other questions of fact, whether these facts constitute elements of
a crime or elements of an excuse or a justification for a crime charged. Indeed
and in all of the cases, the valid exercise of the function of the jury is,
according to the very words of the oath of office taken by them, to give a
verdict according to evidence. They cannot go beyond the evidence and resort to
speculation nor, of course, would it be proper for the trial judge to invite
them to do so. If, then, the record is denuded of any evidence potentially
enabling a reasonable jury acting judicially to find a wrongful act or insult
of the nature and effect set forth in s. 203(3)(a) and (b),
it is then, as a matter of law, within the area exclusively reserved to the
trial judge to so decide and his duty to refrain from putting the defence of
provocation to the jury.

There is nothing, either expressed or
necessarily implied, in the language of s. 203(3) to indicate an intention
of Parliament to modify the principle according to which the sufficiency of
evidence, which is an issue only where there is some evidence, is a question of
fact for the jury and the absence of evidence is a question of law for the
trial judge.

[Page 278]

In the present case the question is whether
there was any evidence potentially enabling a reasonable jury acting judicially
to find that Faid was deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation
that he alleged he received. Counsel for Faid referred only to the two blows
which Faid testified to. The Court of Appeal of Alberta said (at p. 357):

In this case the appellant testified that
during his conversation with Wilson in the trailer, Wilson confirmed that he
had or was going to place a “contract” on the appellant’s life, and inquired
with a smile what he, the appellant, intended to do about it. The appellant
further testified that he was immediately attacked by Wilson, firstly with
blows, and subsequently with a knife, on his attempt to leave the trailer after
this conversation.

The Court went on to say that the circumstances
of this case indicated that a verdict of manslaughter seemed improbable where
the accused stabbed the deceased to prevent him obtaining another weapon.

There can be no doubt that a reasonable jury
acting judicially could find a blow to the head or a knife attack to be a
wrongful act or insult of the nature and effect set forth in s. 215 (3) .
Provocation no doubt existed here but that is not the end of the inquiry. The
critical question to be answered in this case was whether there was any evidence
that Faid was provoked. Was there any evidence of passion or that he “acted
upon” the provocation on the sudden and before there was time for his passion
to cool? We have only his evidence on the point and nowhere in that evidence
does one find any suggestion that as a result of the blows or other conduct of
Wilson he was enraged, or that his passions were inflamed, or that he killed in
heat of blood. There was no evidence of “a sudden temporary loss of control
rendering the accused so subject to passion as to make him or her for the
moment not master of his mind” which is, as Devlin J. said in R. v. Duffy, [1949]
1 All E.R. 932, of the essence of provocation. The defence throughout, the only
defence, was self-defence. Faid, on his version, was using measured force to

[Page 279]

resist the force being used against him.

The absence of evidence of passion is probably
understandable. It would have been fatal to the defence of self-defence to say
that, if the self-defence plea failed, then, in the alternative, Faid stabbed
Wilson in the heat of passion while deprived of the power of self-control.

Let us return briefly to the evidence. According
to his narrative Faid received two blows and responded by punching Wilson and
knocking him over the coffee table. Faid did not then attack Wilson. On the
contrary Wilson arose with a knife, Faid “side kicked” Wilson, knocked him down
again, and then had recourse to the crescent wrench:

That’s when I very quickly just reacted,
grabbed the crescent wrench, ran over to him and it him on the back of the head
a number of times, as I was trying to knock him out. I figured that if I could
knock him out that would be it and I could leave, there would be no further
fighting.

There is no suggestion in this that Faid was
provoked to homicidal actions. After the struggle Faid was on top of Wilson.
Faid had the knife. His testimony continues:

When I got the knife away from him and told
him that it was—that was it, there was no need to go on, because I had the
knife and as far as I was concerned, the fight should have ended, because it
didn’t make sense for him to try and get up, because I wasn’t about to stab
him.

Again there is no evidence that Faid acted out
of provocation. According to Faid, Wilson appeared to be attempting to get a
“spear gun” and, as a result:

I stabbed him to stop him, I didn’t stab
him to kill him. I stabbed him once and it didn’t seem to affect him at all… I
stabbed him in the upper back, which was the only thing that was open to me, I
didn’t stab him there because his heart was there or any reason like that, I
just stabbed him.

In his later evidence, Faid said:

[Page 280]

He was going towards that general direction
[of the spear gun]. I would have taken that he was trying to get it. I was also
taking it that he was trying to get up.

There is not a vestige of evidence to support an
argument that Faid killed in the heat of passion. No doubt for this reason
counsel for Faid refrained from addressing any such argument to the jury.

I conclude with a passage from the judgment of
my brother McIntyre in Olbey v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1008 which
seems apt (at p. 1022):

It will be recalled that the appellant did
not raise the defence of provocation at trial but relied on self-defence. It
may be observed here that at no time did the appellant say that he had been
provoked into violent conduct by the words and conduct of the deceased. In
fact, his description of events goes far to negate any suggestion of
provocation. His evidence reveals an attack, described clearly and with some
detail, to which he reacted, not on the sudden, but by defending himself. When,
according to his evidence, he saw the deceased put his hand inside his sweater,
he considered that the deceased was reaching for a gun and, in fear of his
life, he shot and killed him. This describes a calculated and rational series
of defensive acts, not a sudden reaction in the heat of passion.

In the circumstances I do not think that the
question of the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) arises. There is
simply no evidence capable of supporting or “conveying any sense of reality” to
a defence of provocation. Faid said that it was self-defence which led him to
kill Wilson. The jury rejected that claim. There is no evidentiary foundation
sufficient to convey reality to a fall-back position based on provoked killing
in the “heat of passion”.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal of Alberta and restore the judgment of conviction in the
Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta. As the respondent appealed both conviction
and sentence to the Court of Appeal and was successful on the appeal as to
conviction that Court did not have occasion to consider the appeal as to
sentence. I would refer the matter back to the Court of Appeal of Alberta to hear
and dispose of the sentence appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Evidence—Cross-examination of
Crown witness—Trial judge erred in precluding questions concerning witness’
outstanding indictment—Whether error a substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34, s. 613(1)(b)(iii).

Appellant, who was convicted of second degree
murder, put forward several allegations on appeal, among them, that the trial
judge erred in precluding cross-examination by the defence of a Crown witness
with respect to an outstanding murder charge preferred against that witness by
the same police department that had laid the present charge against the
appellant. The Court of Appeal, applying s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code,
dismissed the appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

Cross-examination of a Crown witness
concerning an outstanding indictment against that witness is proper and
admissible for the purpose of showing a possible motivation to seek favour with
the prosecution. Here, the trial judge erred in precluding defence counsel from
pursuing this line of questioning. The provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  could not be applied to this case. It could not be
said with the necessary degree of finality that, without that error, the jury
as reasonable men, could not have done otherwise than find the appellant
guilty.

Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739, considered; Koufis v. The King, [1941]
S.C.R. 481, distinguished; R. v. Miller and Cockriell (1976), 24

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing
appellant’s appeal from his conviction of second degree murder. Appeal allowed.

[Page 260]

Alan D. Gold, for the appellant.

David Watt, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing the
appeal of the appellant from his conviction of the offence of second degree
murder entered after a trial held before Mr. Justice Osler sitting with a
jury at the assizes of the Supreme Court of Ontario at Ottawa on a charge that
he

… on or about the 3rd day of February,
1978, at the City of Ottawa in the said Judicial District, did unlawfully kill
one Douglas Castle and thereby committed first degree murder, contrary to the
form of the Criminal Code  of Canada, Section 218.

The reasons for judgment from which this appeal
is taken are to be found in the following “Disposition” endorsed on the Notice
of Appeal by Jessup, J.A. on behalf of the Court of Appeal:

DISPOSITION
OF APPEAL

We would dismiss the appeal for the reasons
argued in the Respondents [sic] factum, and in particular that the
verdict was reasonable and that any errors in the admission or exclusion of
evidence caused no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

Initially some inconvenience was occasioned in
this Court by reason of the fact that the respondent’s factum was not included
in the material submitted and formed no part of the Case on Appeal; however,
with the co-operation of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, it was found that the
submissions made here on behalf of the respondent were virtually identical with
those submitted in “The respondents [sic] factum” to which Jessup, J.A.
referred and it was apparent that the central points at issue as described in
the factum of the appellant in this Court were:

Whether the learned trial judge erred in
precluding defence cross-examination of a Crown witness concerning an
outstanding charge of murder against the witness.

[Page 261]

Whether the learned trial judge erred in
not granting a motion for a directed verdict on the charge as laid at the close
of the Crown’s case prior to calling on the defence to call evidence, or
alternatively erred in not amending the charge from first to second degree
murder at that point.

Whether the learned trial judge erred in
failing to caution the jury of the danger of acting on the uncorroborated
evidence of the disreputable witnesses Miehm and Assaly.

Whether the Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in applying
Section 613(1) (b)(iii) in the circumstances.

The question of whether or not any of the errors
alleged to have been made by the learned trial judge are such as to warrant
this appeal being decided in favour of the appellant is of course to be
considered in light of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  which
provides that:

613. (1) On
the hearing of an appeal against a conviction… the court of appeal

…

(b) may dismiss the appeal where

…

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of
the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) the
appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred;

This section falls to be considered in
light of the decision of this Court in Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965]
S.C.R. 739, which was carefully considered in the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia in R. v. Miller and Cockriell (1976), 24 C.C.C. (2d) 401 where
Robertson J.A. wrote the principal judgment of the court and particular
reference was made to the judgment of Spence J. at p. 755 of the Supreme
Court of Canada Report where he said:

Therefore, this Court must apply the test
set out in the aforesaid cases and, to quote again from Brooks v. The King [(1927),
48 C.C.C. 333 at p. 358, [1928] 1 D.L.R. 268 at p. 271, [1927] S.C.R. 633]:

… the onus was upon the Crown to satisfy
the Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could

[Page 262]

not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise
than find the appellant guilty.

I think it desirable to deal with the above
issues in the order in which they are presented.

The first issue has to do with the evidence of
the Crown witness Miehm and the validity or otherwise of the ruling made by
Mr. Justice Osler precluding his being cross-examined relating to an
outstanding indictment preferred against him in a different case and not
disposed of at the time of the Titus trial.

It is not by any means impossible that the
jury’s verdict might have been affected if they had known the facts of Miehm’s
background and the motive which it afforded him to favour the prosecution’s
case. The burden lies upon the Crown to prove that the verdict would necessarily
have been the same, and I cannot say with any finality that that would have
been so had Osler J. permitted the cross-examination on Miehm’s pending trial
for another murder. The judge’s ruling in this regard reads as follows:

In this matter, a witness called by the
Crown has been examined-in-chief and has admitted to a number of prior
convictions. On cross-examination, Counsel for the accused now wishes to ask
the witness whether he is not, at this time, facing a serious criminal charge
laid against him by the same police department that laid the charge now before
the Court and faced by Mr. Titus.

While there appears to be no direct
authority on the point, by analogy with the well‑known decision in Koufas
vs. The King [sic] it seems to me it would be wrong to expose the
witness to such a question. Within the discretion of a trial judge, it is
virtually never permitted to Counsel to cross-examine with respect to charges
laid or pending but not finally dealt with. Section 12(1) of the Evidence
Act is clear authority for the way in which previous convictions may be put to
a witness and, treating the matter completely at large, it seems to me that,
conviction having been dealt with in the section, it was not the intention of
Parliament that a charge should expose a witness to the same procedure. To
request such questions would be to run directly contrary to the practice
governed by the basic presumption that all persons are innocent until proved
guilty, and the prejudicial effect with respect to the witness

[Page 263]

might be very considerable. As a matter of
logic, it cannot properly be stated that the laying of a charge affects the
character of a witness, and it would not, in my view, be proper to investigate
such an occurrence in the present circumstances. I should add that the charge
laid is said to be in no way related to the offence now before the Court, or to
the events surrounding that offence.

The questions may not at this stage be put
to the witness.

The case of Koufis, to which the learned
trial judge was obviously referring, is reported in [1941] S.C.R. 481 and is
concerned with the cross-examination of the accused in relation to prior
convictions and it has no relevance to the position of a Crown witness other
than the accused. It should furthermore be observed that s. 12(1)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  is concerned with examination of a witness relating to
previous convictions. It is to be remembered that in the present case Miehm was
neither an accused nor was it proposed to question him concerning a previous
conviction but rather to inquire as to his having been indicted although not
yet tried. In this regard I am satisfied that the appellant was on sound ground
in submitting that cross-examination of a Crown witness concerning an
outstanding indictment against that witness is proper and admissible for the
purpose of showing a possible motivation to seek favour with the prosecution.

I think it essential to stress the purpose for
which the cross-examination is permitted, namely, in order that the defence may
explore to the full all factors which might expose the frailty of the evidence
called by the prosecution. That the accused as he stands in the prisoner’s box
on trial for murder is deemed to be innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt is one of the fundamental presumptions inherent in the common
law and as such the accused is entitled to employ every legitimate means of
testing the evidence called by the Crown to negative that presumption and in my
opinion this includes the right to explore all circumstances capable of
indicating that any of the prosecution witnesses had a motive

[Page 264]

for favouring the Crown. In my opinion the
outstanding indictment preferred against the witness by the same police
department that had laid the present charge against Titus constitutes such a
circumstance and accordingly I am of opinion that the learned trial judge did
indeed err in precluding defence counsel from pursuing this line of
questioning.

As to the second issue raised by the appellant
concerning the alleged error of the trial judge in failing to grant the
appellant’s motion for a directed verdict, I am of opinion that this was indeed
an error which might have affected the appellant’s decision to call no evidence
at the close of the Crown’s case, but any such error was corrected in the final
address to the jury by the trial judge which included the following direction:

Counsel have put it to you, and I formally
instruct you as a matter of law, that there could be no conviction for first
degree murder in this case.

I should say also as to the third alleged error
that I cannot find the verdict to have been affected by any failure of the
trial judge to further caution the jury as to the danger of acting on the
uncorroborated evidence of Miehm and Assaly. This is not an end of the matter
however, as the first error remains outstanding and in my view it cannot be
said with the necessary degree of finality that if the judge had not erred in
failing to permit the cross-examination of Miehm the jury, as reasonable men,
could not have done otherwise than find the accused guilty.

With the greatest respect for the Court of
Appeal, I am accordingly of opinion that this is not a case to which the
provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  are
applicable.

It follows that I would allow this appeal on the
first issue and direct that a new trial be held.

Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN

Criminal law—Murder—Respondent charged with
second degree murder—Evidence establishing first degree murder—Whether or not
accused can be convicted of lesser included offence when evidence establishing
guilt of the greater offence—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 212, 213,
214, 247, 511.

Respondent, although originally charged with
First degree murder, was committed to trial, at the Crown’s request following
the preliminary hearing, on the lesser offence of second degree murder. At
trial, however, respondent’s description of the circumstances surrounding the
murder prompted the Crown to ask the judge to charge the jury with respect to
constructive murder arising from unlawful confinement—an offence classified as
first degree murder. Respondent, using a loaded rifle, had “persuaded” everyone
at his girl friend’s house to leave. When the girl’s hysteria continued, even
after he put the rifle in a different room, respondent retrieved it and shot
her. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal allowed the respondent’s appeal from his
conviction of second degree murder and ordered a new trial; appellant appealed
that decision.

Held (Ritchie
and Wilson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Dickson,
Estey, McIntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: A conviction for second degree murder
can be maintained when that offence has been charged even though the accused,
by operation of statute, would have been guilty of first degree murder if so
charged. The indictment need state only the legal character of the offence and
not the exact section or sections of the Code. Sections 212
and 213 set out the elements of murder. To prove second degree murder, the
Crown had to prove one of the requisite intents set out in s. 212, or that
the accused had caused death during the commission of an offence set out in
s. 213—here, forcible confinement—

[Page 125]

while using a weapon and during which death
ensued as a consequence. Section 214 is subservient to ss. 212 and 213, and
only classifies murder as first or second degree for sentencing purposes. The
jury’s primary and essential determination was whether or not murder had been
committed pursuant to ss. 212 or 213, and to this end considerations of the
distinction between first and second degree murder were irrelevant. The trial
judge did not need to make any reference in his charge to the jury to a finding
of first degree murder pursuant to s. 214(5)(a) when the accused
did not face the charge.

Even though the charge was reduced to second
degree murder, respondent was not entitled to assume that he could not be tried
for “murder by forcible confinement with a gun” because s. 214 made that
offence first degree murder. The evidence established the factual underpinning
of the charge and the charge to the jury could have been anticipated. The
accused was never in jeopardy of a conviction of first degree murder and was
not prejudiced in having to meet a first degree murder test.

The trial judge did not err in charging the
jury on the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his
actions for he clearly identified it as one of common sense and not of law, and
he clearly indicated the jury was not required to draw the inference. The trial
judge properly allowed the Crown’s cross-examination in respect of alleged
incidents of earlier assault in view of the fact that Farrant had put his
non-violent character in issue in earlier testimony. There is nothing in the
evidence to support the contention that the trial judge, in the exercise of his
discretion, erred in ruling the accused’s statement to police voluntary and
admissible.

Per Ritchie
and Wilson JJ. (dissenting): The conviction for second degree murder
cannot be maintained when the respondent was charged with second degree murder
which required a specific intent and the jury was instructed on first degree
murder that required no such intent. The accused was prepared to address the
“intents” required to prove second degree murder but not the question of
forcible confinement that was central to the issue of constructive murder. The
prejudice caused the accused occurred because the element of

[Page 126]

intent required for conviction on the lesser
offence of second degree murder was not a prerequisite for conviction on
constructive murder.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal (1981), 9 Sask.
R. 7, allowing an appeal from a conviction and ordering a new trial. Appeal
allowed, Ritchie and Wilson JJ. dissenting.

Kenneth W. MacKay, for the appellant.

Benjamin Goldstein, Q.C., and Robert
Jackson, for the respondent.

The reasons of Ritchie and Wilson JJ. were
delivered by

WILSON J. (dissenting)—I share the
view of the members of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal that the jury’s verdict
in this case cannot stand.

It is not necessary for me to review the events
leading up to the tragic death of sixteen year old Shannon Russell. My
colleague, Mr. Justice Dickson, has already done so. I wish merely to make
a few observations about ss. 212 , 213  and 214  of the Criminal Code  and
their application to the facts of this case.

It is common ground, I believe, that while
s. 212  requires a mental element in respect of the death, s. 213  does
not. The only intent required for a murder conviction under s. 213  is the
intent to commit the offence in the course of committing which the death
ensued. Applying that to this case, the intent required to be proved against
the respondent for a conviction under s. 213  was the intent to forcibly
confine Shannon. If that intent were proved, then the respondent would be
guilty of the offence of constructive murder under s. 213 .

Section 214  classifies murder. It states that it
is either first or second degree. It is first degree if planned and deliberate.
It is also first degree if, even although not planned and deliberate, death

[Page 127]

occurred inter alia in the course of
forcibly confining. Murder that is not first degree is second degree.

The respondent was charged with second degree
murder. Since he admitted that he caused Shannon’s death, the only issue for
the jury was whether he had either of the intents required by s. 212 .
Indeed, from the opening of the trial to the conclusion of the evidence, this
was expressed by all parties, including the presiding judge, to be the sole
issue before the Court. If he had the required intent, it was murder. If not,
it was manslaughter. However, at the close of the evidence, after a week of
trial, counsel for the Crown for the first time took the position that the jury
should be instructed with respect to s. 213(d) of the Code to
which defence counsel strenuously objected. The trial judge, however, charged
the jury on s. 213 (d) and instructed them that if they found
that Shannon’s death occurred
while the respondent was forcibly confining her, then they could find him
guilty of murder because he had a gun. At no time, however, did he tell them
that, of course, that would be first degree murder with which the accused was
not charged.

In my respectful view the issue in this case is
not which is the controlling section of the Code, s. 214 or ss. 212
and 213. Nor is it whether s. 214 is substantive in terms of
distinguishing distinct offences of first and second degree murder or merely
classifying them for sentencing purposes. I think the issue is: can the
conviction for second degree murder be maintained when the respondent was
charged with second degree murder which required a specific intent and the jury
was instructed on first degree murder that required no such intent. I think it
cannot. The accused, having been charged with second degree, was entitled to
plead and conduct his defence on the basis that the Crown had to prove one of
the intents under s. 212. This was the case he came prepared to meet. He
denied having either of these intents and testified that the gun simply went
off. The jury,

[Page 128]

however, may have convicted him, in light of the
judge’s charge, on the basis of having an entirely different intent, namely, an
intent to forcibly confine and this he was not prepared to meet. We cannot be
sure on what basis the jury convicted him. We do know that, after retiring,
they came back with questions as to what constituted confinement.

It is, in my view, specious to say that the
respondent cannot claim to be prejudiced by a conviction on a lesser charge
where the evidence supports a greater one. I think, with all due respect, that
this misses the point. On the basis of the charge laid the respondent was not
vulnerable to a conviction on proof only of an intent to forcibly confine. One
of the intents under s. 212 had to be proved against him. This is not the
case of an accused charged with a lesser included offence being convicted of
the lesser offence where on the evidence he would also have been guilty of the
greater offence. One of the elements required for a conviction on the lesser
offence of second degree murder, i.e. intent, is not a prerequisite for
a conviction of constructive murder. This is what, in my view, caused real
prejudice to the respondent. Had he appreciated that he might be convicted
under s. 213 he might either not have testified at all or presented
evidence to negate the intent to forcibly confine. Moreover, had the issue of
forcible confinement been raised by the indictment his counsel might well have
mounted an argument that what happened in this case did not amount to “forcible
confinement” within the meaning of s. 247 at all. One might well ask
whether, if Shannon had not been killed, the respondent would have been charged
with forcible confinement under s. 247(2) which seems to be directed to
forcible confinement in a kidnapping or hostage-taking context.

[Page 129]

I would dismiss the appeal for these reasons as
well as for those given by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal.

The judgment of Dickson, Estey, McIntyre,
Chouinard and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The question is whether the trial
judge erred in charging the jury on s. 213, the so-called “constructive
murder” provision of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34. Section
213 embodies the concept that when a weapon is used in the course of certain
specified criminal acts and death results, the accused is treated as if the mens
rea for murder existed and the homicide is murder. The unintended or
accidental lethal act is murder because the actus reus of homicide is
present and the killing is neither justifiable nor excusable. Rightly or
wrongly, since the time of Coke, the law has imported to such acts the mental
element for murder (Coke’s Institutes (1977), vol. 3, p. 56). See
also Hale, Pleas of the Crown (1st Am. ed. 1847), vol. 1, pp. 424-503,
Foster, Foster’s Crown Cases and Crown Law (3d Ed. 1792), at pp. 256,
258 and 308, Blackstone, Blackstone Commentaries, vol. 4, pp. 192-93 and
200‑01, East, Pleas of the Crown (1896), vol. 1, p. 255, and
Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England (1883), pp. 57 and 75.
Coke gives this example: If A, meaning to steal a deer in the park of B, shoots
at the deer, and by the glance of the arrow kills a boy hidden in the bush,
that is murder although A had no intent to hurt the boy. East discusses the
subject under the rubric “Homicide in the prosecution of some act or purpose
criminal or unlawful itself; wherein death ensues collaterally to or beside the
principal intent.”

It might be observed in passing that the
constructive murder rule has been the subject of protracted criticism: Willis
(1951), 29 Can. Bar Rev. 784; Edwards (1960-61), 3 Cr. L.Q. 481; Hooper
(1967-78), 3 U.B.C. L. Rev. 55; Sedgwick (1955), 33 Can. Bar Rev. 63; Burns and
Reid (1977), 55 Can. Bar Rev. 75. As Stuart states in his recent

[Page 130]

work on Canadian Criminal Law, at
p. 223, the vital issue of whether there was a culpable mind respecting
death is simply predetermined and withdrawn from the jury. Section 212 requires
mental culpability in respect of death; s. 213 does not. A killing in the
course of the specified offences may be murder even though the offender never
intended that result. All that is required is the mens rea for the
lesser offence. See R. v. Swietlinski, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 956, at
p. 967. In England the Homicide Act, 1957 did away with the rule.
The rule may seem harsh but it is not the function of this Court to consider
the policy of legislation validly enacted. So long as the
section continues in our Criminal Code  it must be given effect in
accordance with its terms.

The Facts

The tragic incident which gave rise to the
present proceedings arose out of the fatal shooting in the City of Saskatoon on
the evening of Friday, September 14, 1979 of Shannon Russell, aged sixteen. She
was shot by Rolan Farrant, aged seventeen. Shannon and her friend Shelly Thomas
had spent the day together. Early in the evening they went to a friend’s house
for a party. Farrant arrived later. He and Shannon were childhood friends. They
had been “going steady” for four years. Between 8:15 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. Farrant
drank four bottles of beer and had four or five drags, or “tokes” as he called
them, from a pipe of marihuana. Farrant and Shannon talked alone. There was
evience of an argument. In his statement to the police Farrant said “She didn’t
like the way I treated her, I didn’t like the way she was treating me. We just
haven’t been getting along lately”. Then Shannon and her friend left. They went
to Shannon’s house. Other friends arrived. Farrant phoned Shannon. He wanted to
come over and talk to her. She told him she did not want to talk with him as
her friends were there. He told her that he was coming anyway, and that he was
bringing a rifle. Upon arrival, he approached the house from the rear, leaving
the rifle in his vehicle. He met two of his friends on the back porch and asked
them to leave so he could talk to Shannon

[Page 131]

alone. He went inside and ordered everyone to
“go have a coffee for half an hour”. No one left. He went out the back door,
loaded the rifle, and returned to the house with it. Then, as the trial judge
expressed it, “with the persuasiveness of the rifle” they all left. The
witnesses at trial said that Farrant “motioned with his gun” for everyone to
leave. One of Shannon’s friends, Mary Kennedy, grabbed Shannon by the arm and
“told her that she should come with us”. Mary said that Farrant “told me to let
go of her arm and just leave the house”. Shannon was “crying and shaking and
sitting on one of the couches”. Shaun Russell, Shannon’s brother, testified in
part as follows:

Q. And just tell us where he went and
everything you remember about what was said.

A. He came into the living room and
crouched down beside Shannon.

Q. I think you’re going to have to speak up
louder.

A. Crouched down beside Shannon and said,
you come outside, I want to talk to you, something like that.

Q. Okay.

A. She said, no or something like that, I
can’t remember what she said. She said no.

Q. And something else?

A. Yeah, and something else.

Q. And then what did he say?

A. I’m going to make you, something like
that.

and later in his evidence:

Q. Okay, and do you recall any other
conversation when he came back in?

A. Mary said, Shannon would you come out
with me and he said, no stay and he also told Chuck to take his beer with him.

Mary Kennedy said:

He came into the house and he just stood at
the entrance of the living room and he turned to Shannon and said, you better
come with me, and she said, I’m not going with you anywhere. As he turned to us
and told us that we should go for coffee for half an hour and then he

[Page 132]

turned to Shannon and said something about
being serious and then he left. And then Darby and Chuck, they came back into
the house and we decided we should, you know, we should all go for coffee and
take Shannon with us and then Ronny [Farrant] came back into the house and he
had a gun with him and he was yelling, everybody get out of the house right
now, I just want to talk to Shannon. So everybody started leaving and… And as
we left I grabbed Shannon by the wrist and I told her that she should come with
us and Ronny told me to let go of her and just leave the house. So that’s what
I did.

Charles Thompson gave the following evidence:

Rolan returned with a gun. He asked us to
leave, told me to take my beer with me and one of the girls, I’m not sure which
one it was, tried to pick up Shannon and tell her, she said to Shannon, you’re
coming with us then Rolan pointed the gun in the direction of that person and
then we left through the front door.

Everyone left except Farrant and Shannon. There
is only the evidence of Farrant as to what happened next. He testified that
Shannon was crying and hysterical. He put this down to the presence of the
rifle, so he took it out to the kitchen and set it down. He returned to
Shannon, crouched beside her and attempted to pull her hands away from her face
so he could talk to her. She was still hysterical. He went to the kitchen and
brought the rifle back. He could not decide what to do. Then, suddenly, “the
gun just went off”. The shot proved fatal. In his statement to the police he
said simply that he “went back to the kitchen and got the rifle”, and “I shot
her”. He telephoned the operator and told her to call the police as he had just
killed his girl friend. A second shot was fired in an unsuccessful attempt by
Farrant to commit suicide.

II

Procedural History

Farrant was charged with first degree murder. At
the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry the Crown requested a committal for
trial on the lesser offence of second degree murder, and the accused was
committed for trial on that charge. A jury

[Page 133]

convicted him on second degree murder. Farrant
appealed his conviction and the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ordered a new
trial. The Crown, with leave of this Court, now appeals that decision.

III

The Section 213 Point

The appeal concerns the operation of s. 213
and, incidentally, s. 212  and 214  of the Criminal Code . Stripped of
non-essentials these three sections read as follows:

212.
Culpable homicide is murder

(a) where the person who causes the
death of a human being

(i) means to cause his death, or

(ii) means to cause him bodily harm that he
knows is likely to cause his death, and is reckless whether death ensues or
not.

213. Culpable
homicide is murder where a person causes the death of a human being while
committing or attempting to commit… an offence mentioned in… 247 (kidnapping
and forcible confinement),… whether or not the person means to cause
death to any human being and whether or not he knows that death is likely
to be caused to any human being, if

…

(d) he uses a weapon
or has it upon his person

(i) during or at the time he commits or
attempts to commit the offence,

and the death ensues as a consequence.

214. (1)
Murder is first degree murder or second degree murder.

…

(5) Irrespective of whether a murder is
planned and deliberate on the part of any person, murder is first degree murder
in respect of a person when the death is caused by that person

(a) while committing or
attempting to commit an offence under section… 247 (kidnapping and forcible
confinement)

…

(7) All murder that is not first degree
murder is second degree murder.

[Emphasis added.]

[Page 134]

Two other sections of the Code should
be mentioned. Section 247 provides in part:

(2) Every one who, without lawful
authority, confines, imprisons or forcibly seizes another person
is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for five
years.

[Emphasis added.]

Section 511 reads:

511. No
person shall be convicted for the offence of high treason or first degree
murder unless in the indictment charging the offence he is specifically charged
with that offence.

In adopting the words “means to” in s. 212 (a)(i)
and s. 212 (a)(ii) Parliament introduced the element of intent.
Culpable homicide is murder under this section if the Crown proves either
that the accused meant to cause death, or meant to cause bodily harm that he
knew was likely to cause death, and was reckless whether death ensued or not.

On the other hand, s. 213, the
“constructive murder” section, does not require proof of such an intent.
Section 213 makes this apparent by the use of the words “whether or not the
person means to cause death to any human being and whether or not he knows that
death is likely to be caused to any human being”. If, for example, a person
uses a weapon, or has one upon his person, in the course of committing the
offence of forcible confinement under s. 247 of the Code, and if
death ensues as a consequence, then the culpable homicide is murder. The only
intent with which the court is concerned in these circumstances, is the intent
unlawfully to confine.

At the close of evidence at Farrant’s trial, the
Crown asked the judge to charge the jury with respect to s. 213 of the Code,
based on “the accused’s own evidence of wishing to use the gun or rifle to
clear the house out and keep the girl there so he could talk to her”.
Mr. Goldstein, counsel for Farrant, replied that he was aware of the
section, but was confident that the matter would not be raised, since “at no
time until this moment either at the preliminary inquiry, either at the opening
address of my learned friend and neither in the charge” was there any
indication that the accused was being charged with the com-

[Page 135]

mission of an offence under s. 213. He
contended that “as a matter of fairness”, apart from the law, it would be a
grave injustice to proceed in the direction sought by the Crown. Secondly, he
submitted that in this case there was no intent to confine against anyone’s
wish, and even if there were, it had been abandoned. In reply Crown counsel
said that she had not intended to make s. 213 a main part of her argument
until she heard the evidence of Farrant. She referred to the following passages
from his evidence:

Q. You decided that you were going to take
the rifle and you were going to go over there and you were going to make her
talk to you whether she wanted to stay or not, isn’t that true?

A. I wouldn’t quite say it that way, no.

Q. You wouldn’t quite say it that way?

A. No I wouldn’t.

Q. That’s essentially true, isn’t it?

A. It would be essentially, but it’s not
the way I would think, no.

Q. That’s not the way—you perhaps don’t
think the way I put my words together, but the meaning is the same isn’t it?

A. Deep down the hard cold meaning would be
the same, but the fact of what’s going on in my mind and somebody else’s mind
is two different things.

…

Q. And you wanted to talk to her?

A. Yeah, when I phoned her that was the
situation.

Q. You’ve already agreed that you were
going to make her talk to you, right?

A. After that phone call, yes.

Q. You were going to make her talk to you
using that rifle?

A. Well, if it was necessary I guess because
I brought it there, that would be true.

The court ruled that:

Taking into consideration the extracts from
the transcript of the cross-examination of the accused and the facts generally,
I have come to the conclusion that I must, as a matter of law, put that
section to the jury because I’m satisfied that a ruling as to the
applicability

[Page 136]

of the section is based on facts and
those facts are for the jury to decide.

The judge charged the jury that they must find
Farrant guilty of either second degree murder or manslaughter. There was no
other verdict open to them. After referring to sections 218(1) , 205  and
212  of the Criminal Code  the judge addressed the issue of constructive
murder:

In this particular case there is another
way the offence of murder may be committed at law. Common parlance we use for
it is “constructive murder”. And this is found in another section 213 and
again I will read you the pertinent section.

Having done so, he went on to say:

So the question you must determine first of
all is whether or not this accused was confining Shannon Russell. If you do so
find, I suggest to you that there has been no indication that he had any lawful
authority to so confine her so you don’t have to concern yourself about the
portion that says “without lawful authority”. The second requirement is that
there must be a death of a human being and I think you will find that this did
take place. But most important is the third requirement, and that is that the
death must be caused while he was either committing or attempting to commit the
offence of unlawful confinement. If you accept the evidence of the accused that
when he was in the home after the others had left that he took the weapon and
put it in the kitchen when Shannon Russell became hysterical and returned to
simply talk to her, you must ask yourself the question, was he forcibly
confining her or attempting to do so at the time he retrieved the weapon and
fired the fatal shot. Was there a confinement at that time or an attempt at
confinement, or had he abondoned (sic) any confinement or ideas of
confinement he originally had and simply wanted to talk to Shannon. And again,
unless you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he was either
committing the act of forcible confinement or attempting to do so, you must
give the accused the benefit of that doubt and not find him liable under this
particular section. But on the other hand, if you are satisfied, you may find
that it was murder. And in that case you may find so whether or not he meant to
cause her death or meant to cause her bodily harm that he knew was likely to
cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not.

[Page 137]

The judge pointed out to the jury that the
defence rejected the theory of the Crown that the act of forcible confinement
was being committed or attempted when the fatal shot was fired:

If there was any forcible confinement at
most it was when the accused had the rifle in his hand and told Shannon she was
to stay. But thereafter the confinement was abandoned, counsel on behalf of the
defence says, and the rifle was taken and put in the kitchen and all the
accused wanted to do was talk. It was only when the talking failed that the
fatal shot was fired. Defence says that the theory of the Crown that this was
constructive murder simply does not apply to these facts. And if you accept the
evidence of the accused that he did take the rifle to the kitchen and only
returned for the purpose of talking to Shannon, I would agree with counsel for
the defence that you may find that the section does not apply, but it is
your decision on the facts as you have heard them. And once again I must warn
you, you must be satisfied that the accused was attempting or committing that
offence and satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt before you can apply Section
213.

The matter was addressed again later in the
charge:

I suggest you first consider whether the
Crown has established to your satisfaction the offence of murder under Section
213 that is commonly called constructive murder. Before you convict under this
section you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the death
actually took place during or at the time the offence of forcible confinement
was either being committed or attempted. If you conclude that there never was
an attempt to forcibly confine Shannon, that the use of the gun was only to
clear the others out of the house, or that any force to confine Shannon was
abondoned (sic) when he took the gun into the kitchen, or even
have a reasonable doubt that in the circumstances there was a forcible
confinement, you must not find the accused guilty under this section. If you
are so satisfied, however, that is the end of your task you are free to find
the accused guilty of second degree murder.

The trial judge instructed the jury at length on
s. 212 of the Code and on the intents necessary to found a
conviction under that section.

[Page 138]

The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal held that the
trial judge had erred in two respects:

(1) to instruct the jury as to their right to
bring in a verdict on a charge which was neither disclosed nor included in the
indictment, was to charge the jury upon a matter of which the appellant was
unaware at the time he pleaded;

(2) by failing to instruct the jury that if they
found the appellant guilty of murder pursuant to s. 214(5)(a), then
in law, the verdict must be one of guilty of first degree murder.

It should be mentioned at this point that the
trial judge in his charge at no time made any reference to a finding of guilty
of first degree murder pursuant to s. 214(5) (a) of the Criminal
Code . With respect, I cannot see why he should have entered into a
discussion of first degree murder when the accused did not face that charge.

In delivering judgment on behalf of the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, Culliton C.J.S. said:

When the trial opened, the appellant was on
trial for second degree murder. To establish that offence the onus was on the
Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had caused the
death of Shannon Russell and in so doing had one of the requisite intents as
set out in Section 212 . It was admitted the appellant had caused the death of
Shannon Russell. Thus in determining whether or not he was guilty of second
degree murder the sole issue before the jury was did he, at the time, have one
of the intents as set out in Section 212 , necessary to prove that offence.

With respect, the learned Chief Justice defines
the position too narrowly. To establish the offence of second degree murder the
onus was on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt the uncontested fact
that Farrant had caused the death of Shannon Russell, and, either

(a) that he had one of the requisite intents set
out in s. 212 , or

(b) that he had caused her death while
committing or attempting to commit one of the offences specified in
s. 213, in this case forcible confinement within s. 247, while

[Page 139]

using or having on his person a weapon and that
death ensued as a consequence.

With all due respect to the Saskatchewan Court
of Appeal, I find no error in the trial judge’s charge to the jury. The accused
Farrant was charged with second degree murder contrary to s. 218(1)  of the
Criminal Code :

218. (1)
Every one who commits first degree murder or second degree murder is guilty of
an indictable offence and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life.

Murder, like other offences in the Criminal
Code , such as theft, may be committed in one of several ways. Culpable
homicide may be murder under either s. 212  or s. 213 . Both
sections begin with the words “Culpable homicide is murder where”. Farrant
was charged with murder. He might fall foul of either section. There was
evidence upon which the jury could find a forcible confinement, and the trial
judge was correct in stating that, as a matter of law, he was obliged to put both
s. 212  and 213  to the jury.

The main issue raised in this appeal is the
possibility of a conviction for second degree murder as charged, where, by
operation of statute, the evidence discloses that the accused would have been
guilty of first degree murder had this latter offence been charged. More
particularly, does an offence of second degree constructive murder pursuant to
forcible confinement exist having regard to s. 214(5) (a), which
provides:

214. …

(5) Irrespective of whether a murder is
planned and deliberate on the part of any person, murder is first degree murder
in respect of a person when the death is caused by that person

(a) while committing or
attempting to commit an offence under section… 247 (kidnapping and forcible
confinement)…

The Crown contends that the Court of Appeal
erred: 1) in finding that the charge of second degree constructive murder
pursuant to a forcible

[Page 140]

confinement was not disclosed in the indictment;
and 2) in requiring that constructive murder pursuant to a forcible confinement
is necessarily first degree murder. The Crown’s argument is that s. 214  of
the Criminal Code  is merely a classification section, and that the
definition of culpable homicide which is murder is found in ss. 212  and 213 .
The Crown says that when charging an accused with murder there is no onus to
specify in the indictment whether it intends to rely upon s. 212  or
s. 213 . In ordering a new trial on second degree murder the Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal restricted the proceedings to a consideration of s. 212 ,
murder with intent. The practical result of the Court of Appeal decision, the
Crown contends, is an interference with the discretion of the Crown in the
choice of charges it will lay.

The respondent Farrant argues that constructive
murder pursuant to a forcible confinement is first degree murder. Therefore an
instruction with respect to s. 213 must necessarily be an instruction with
respect to first degree murder, a charge which does not appear in the
indictment. The wording of s. 214(5) (a), according to the
respondent, is not permissive, but mandatory and conclusive. In order to
convict on constructive murder pursuant to forcible confinement, first degree
must be charged. First degree murder was not charged, and the accused says he
was prejudiced by having to answer to a first degree murder test under
s. 214(5) (a).

Section 214 , however, is not the
section which sets out the elements of the offence of murder. This is done
in ss. 212  and 213 . Section 214  does not create a distinct and independent
substantive offence of first degree constructive murder pursuant to forcible
confinement. The section is subservient to ss. 212  and 213 ; it classifies
for sentencing purposes, the offences in s. 212  and s. 213  as either
first or second degree murder. The importance of the distinction between first
and second degree murder is that first degree murder carries with it a
mandatory life sentence without eligibility for

[Page 141]

parole for twenty-five years (s. 218,
s. 669(a)). A conviction for second degree murder also carries with
it a mandatory life sentence, but parole may be granted after ten years of
imprisonment unless the jury recommends a greater number of years.

With respect, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal
erred in stating that:

The great distinction between murder under
Section 214(5) (a) and second degree murder under Section 212 , is that to obtain
a conviction under the former it is not necessary to establish either of the
intents required for the conviction of second degree murder under Section 212 .

There is no distinction between s. 214(5) (a)
and s. 212  based upon intent. The presence or absence of intent is the
distinction between s. 212  and s. 213 , not s. 214 . Intent is an
element of the offence of murder under s. 212 , be it first or second degree.
The distinction between first and second degree murder in s. 214  is not
based upon intent; it is based upon 1) the presence of planning and
deliberation (s. 214(2)); 2) the identity of the victim (s. 214(4)); or 3) the
nature of the offence being committed at the time of the murder (s. 214(5) ).
The primary and essential determination for a jury to make is whether murder
has been committed, either under s. 212  or, where the evidence warrants
it, under s. 213. Considerations of the distinctions between first and
second degree murder are irrelevant in making this preliminary determination.
Once the offence has been found, it is then classified.

To argue that s. 214  is controlling in a
situation such as the present one is to confuse the sections which set out
the elements of the offence of murder with the classification process provided
in s. 214 . The classification in s. 214  functions within

[Page 142]

the context of sentencing and is not
determinative of the substantive offence of murder.

Counsel for the respondent laid much emphasis on
the imperative language of the English version of s. 214(5) . The French
version is much less so. The relevant portion reads:

(5) Est assimilé au meurtre au premier degré,
le meurtre…

In my view a conviction for second degree murder
can be maintained when that offence has been charged even though the accused
person by operation of statute would have been guilty of first degree murder if
he had been charged with that greater offence. Recent years have seen a certain
relaxation in the formalism attendant upon criminal proceedings. An indictment,
such as this one, charging second degree murder need not specify the exact
section or sections of the Criminal Code  which constitute an
offence. It is sufficient that it state the legal character of the offence (see
R. v. McKenzie, [1972] S.C.R. 409).

There was, in my opinion, no error in the trial
judge’s charge to the jury. The verdict returned by the jury was equally
consistent with a finding of intent under s. 212  as it was with a finding
of constructive murder under s. 213.

IV

Fairness at Trial

Although I am of the view that the law and the
facts warranted, and indeed required, a charge upon s. 213 of the Code,
there remains the question of whether, once the Crown had decided to reduce
the charge to second degree murder, Farrant was entitled to assume that he
could not be tried for “murder by forcible confinement with a gun”, because
s. 214  makes that offence first degree murder. Although not expressed in
these terms, implicit in Farrant’s objection is the suggestion that at trial
the case for the defence was conducted on the basis of that assumption; that
Crown witnesses were cross-examined, and his own

[Page 143]

testimony given, on the basis that evidence of
intent to forcibly confine Shannon Russell was irrelevant. Farrant complains
that by instructing the jury that they might convict him of murder under
s. 213, the trial judge erred by exposing him to conviction for a crime
that had not been charged against him.

I do not think this complaint can be maintained.
Counsel was aware of s. 213 of the Code, and, with a client facing
a murder charge, he knew or ought to have known, that the Crown could rely upon
this section if the evidence afforded a factual base for forcible
confinement.

In her opening address Crown counsel recounted
events leading up to the shooting from which one could take it that forcible
confinement might be part of the Crown’s case. Take, for example, this passage:

All the young people including Shannon made
preparations to leave. Within a minute or two Ronny Farrant came back into the
house carrying a rifle. He told everyone to get out and leave Shannon. Mary
Kennedy tried to pull Shannon by the arm and Ronny told her to let go and get
out of the house. As the group left Shannon was sitting on a chair crying alone
with the accused.

When all of the evidence was adduced, including
that of the accused on cross-examination, one could say that the necessary
factual underpinning was present.

It was open to the defence at any time before or
during trial to ask for particulars with a view to determining whether forcible
confinement was in issue. Failing a negative response to such request counsel
could anticipate that s. 213 might arise.

Furthermore, when Crown counsel moved the court
to charge on s. 213 it was open to the defence to ask for the recall of
witnesses, or the calling of additional witnesses, to refute the allegation of
forcible confinement. Counsel in argument before the trial judge and before
this Court, failed to indicate in what way he would have conducted

[Page 144]

the case differently had he known that
s. 213 of the Code was to be invoked. He did not say “I would have
done this or I would not have done that, had I known”. All that can be said is
that he did not expect the Crown to rely on s. 213. Neither did the trial
judge, as his comments disclose. Nonetheless, on the facts, and the law,
s. 213 was applicable.

There is in my view no merit in the argument
that the accused was prejudiced in having to answer to a first degree murder
test under s. 214(5) (a). He was not charged with first degree murder; he
could not have been convicted of first degree murder (s. 511  of the Criminal
Code ); he was never in jeopardy of such a conviction. It is difficult to
understand how an accused could be prejudiced by a conviction on a lesser
charge where the evidence supports a greater one. The accused, from the
beginning, is at less risk.

V

Supplementary Issues

Several additional issues were raised in the
Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan with which that Court did not deal because of
its decision on the main point.

First, that the judge erred in law in charging
the jury of “…the presumption that (a) man intends the natural consequences of
his actions”; and that the jury must bear “…in mind that one basic inference is
that everyone is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his or her
actions”. The judge made it abundantly clear however that this was a
proposition of common sense and not one of law. He said:

You may proceed on the common sense
proposition that most adult people usually intend the natural consequences of
their acts, but you must consider the state of mind of this accused at the
material time and decide whether he, and he alone, intended or was reckless of
the natural consequences of his acts.

[Page 145]

Earlier in the judgment he had said:

It is an inference that you may draw. And
if on all the facts of the case it is in your opinion not a correct inference
that the accused intended those natural consequences of his act, then it should
not be drawn.

I do not find error.

Second, that the judge, having ruled against
permitting the prosecutor to adduce “similar fact” evidence, erred in
permitting the prosecutor to cross-examine the accused about alleged incidents
of assault which purportedly occurred many months prior to the date of the
offence charged. During examination in chief Farrant testified:

Well, think about it now there’s no way I
would, you know, it’s not my character to be violent, you know, use violence or
a rifle, you know, to get my own way. That’s not my character.

The judge allowed the Crown to cross-examine in
respect of alleged incidents of earlier assault. I do not think he erred in so
doing, having regard to the fact that Farrant had put his non-violent character
in issue in earlier testimony.

Third, the judge erred in law in ruling the
statement taken from the accused by the police to be a voluntary one and
admissible in evidence, in light of the surrounding circumstances and the
existing law. I have read the evidence carefully and I find nothing to support
the contention that the trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion, erred
in law in admitting the statement.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan and restore the verdict at trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal
law—Evidence—Admissibility—Interception of private communications—New offence
suspected during course of investigation—New offence not specified in renewed
authorization—Whether communications intercepted after renewal and relating to
new offence admissible—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (as amended by
1973-74 (Can.), c. 50, s. 2; 1976-77 (Can.), c. 53, ss. 7 to 12), ss.
178.1, 178.2, 178.11, 178.12, 178.13, 178.16, 178.22.

Appellant was convicted of conspiring to
possess counterfeit money. At trial, the evidence relating to the offence was
adduced through lawful interceptions of private communications made pursuant to
a renewed authorization that related only to narcotics offences. Prior to the
renewal, the police had suspected that the appellant was conspiring to possess
counterfeit money but did not apply for an authorization to intercept
communications with respect to that offence. The majority of the Court of
Appeal held the evidence inadmissible and quashed the conviction. This appeal
is to determine whether an authorization to intercept private communications in
respect of one offence is sufficient to render lawful interceptions in respect
of a different offence, in circumstances where the interceptions in respect of
the different offence were anticipated at the time the authorization was
obtained.

Held (Ritchie,
Dickson, Chouinard and Wilson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ.: When an authorization to
intercept private communications is lawfully obtained—i.e. pursuant to
and in compliance with s. 178.13  of the Criminal Code —any
intercepted conversation which discloses evidence relating to offences not
specified in the authorization is admissible in support of charges relating to
those offences. The interception need not be “unanticipated”.

[Page 122]

The distinction between “anticipated” and
“unanticipated” interception is nowhere to be found in s. 178.16(3.1) of
the Code.

possess counterfeit money. Appeal allowed, Ritchie, Dickson, Chouinard and
Wilson JJ. dissenting.

J.D. Taylor, for the appellant.

Marc Rosenberg, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Beetz, Estey,
McIntyre and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

LAMER J.—The accused was tried and convicted by
a jury in Vancouver of
conspiring to possess counterfeit money. He appealed his conviction to the
British Columbia Court of Appeal and an acquittal was entered. Craig J.A.,
dissenting on a question of law, would have upheld the conviction. The Crown is
now appealing to this Court as of right pursuant to s. 621(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code  of Canada.

THE FACTS

The facts need not, for the purpose of this
appeal, be set out fully. The evidence adduced against the accused was
essentially that of telephone conversations intercepted by the police through
the use of “wiretapping equipment”. It is agreed by all that if this evidence
is, as was found by the Court of Appeal, inadmissible, then the Crown’s appeal
should fail and the acquittal stand; if to the contrary then the jury’s
conviction should be restored.

[Page 123]

The police had started out investigating
narcotics offences and, on May 14, 1976, were authorized under s. 178.13  of the Criminal Code  to
intercept the private communications of persons other than the accused. As a
result of interceptions, the police became suspicious that the brother of the
accused and others were involved in a conspiracy with respect to counterfeit
money. On July 9, 1976, the “narcotic authorization” was renewed. Prior to this
renewal, the police had consulted Crown counsel with the object of applying for
an authorization under s. 178.12  to intercept communications with respect
to the counterfeiting offence. They were advised by the Crown that this was not
necessary. The evidence relating to the conspiracy to possess counterfeit
money, the admissibility of which is at issue in this case, was adduced through
interceptions that were made pursuant to the renewed authorization for the
investigation of the narcotic conspiracy.

Of importance in this appeal is the fact that it
was admitted by all that the authorizations and renewals were properly
obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code  and that
no witnesses need be called to prove their validity. It is further admitted
that on or about July 4, 1976, the investigators suspected that co-conspirators
named Gallo and Magisano were conspiring with Remo Commisso with respect to
counterfeit money, and suspected that Gallo and Magisano were using the code
word “ceramics” for counterfeit money, but did not believe they had grounds for
applying for an authorization until July 9, 1976, the date of the renewal.
Finally, respondent admits that the police officers were continuing a bona
fide investigation on the suspected heroin offence at the time they heard
the conversations they adduced in evidence in the counterfeit charge.

THE LAW

Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  is titled
“Invasion of Privacy”. This chapter was introduced in 1974. However uncertain
the state of the law prior

[Page 124]

to that enactment, Parliament for the protection
of the citizens’ privacy then made it a crime to wilfully intercept a private
communication by means of an electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanic or other
device. Recognizing however the need to assist the police in the detection of
crime, Parliament has under certain circumstances and under judicial control
set out procedures under which interceptions may be lawful. The police, when
investigating certain offences, may be authorized by a judge to invade the
privacy of certain citizens, if the conditions set out in s. 178.13  are
met. (I am referring to the law as it was at the time of the interception.)

178.13 (1)
An authorization may be given if the judge to whom the application is made is
satisfied that it would in the best interests of the administration of justice
to do so and that

(a) other investigative
procedures have been tried and have failed;

(b) other investigative
procedures are unlikely to succeed; or

(c) the urgency of the matter is
such that it would be impractical to carry out the investigation of the offence
using only other investigative procedures.

(2) An authorization shall

(a) state the offence in respect of
which private communications may be intercepted;

(b) state the type of private
communication that may be intercepted;

(c) state the identity of the
persons, if known, whose private communications are to be intercepted and where
the identity of such persons is not known, generally describe the place at
which private communications may be intercepted or, if a general description of
that place cannot be given, generally describe the manner of interception that
may be used;

(d) contain such terms and
conditions as the judge considers advisable in the public interests; and

(e) be valid for the period,
not exceeding thirty days, set forth therein.

(2.1) The Solicitor General of Canada or
the Attorney General, as the case may be, may designate a person or persons who
may intercept private communications under authorizations.

(3) Renewals of an authorization may be
given from time to time by a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction
or a judge as defined in section 482 upon

[Page 125]

receipt by him of an ex parte application
in writing signed by the Attorney General of the province in which the
application is made or the Solicitor General of Canada or an agent specially
designated in writing for the purposes of section 178.12 by the Solicitor
General of Canada or the Attorney General, as the case may be, accompanied by
an affidavit of a peace officer or public officer deposing to the following
matters, namely:

(a) the reason and period for
which the renewal is required, and

(b) full particulars,
together with times and dates, when interceptions, if any, were made or
attempted under the authorization, and any information that has been obtained
by any interception,

and supported by such other information as
the judge may require.

(4) A renewal of an authorization may be
given if the judge to whom the application is made is satisfied that any of the
circumstances described in subsection (1) still obtain, but no such
renewal shall be for a period exceeding thirty days.

In order to discourage unlawful invasions of the
privacy of citizens, Parliament not only made it an indictable offence but also
enacted an exclusionary rule which is an exception to the general rule that
unlawfully obtained evidence is nevertheless admissible:

178.16 (1) A
private communication that has been intercepted is inadmissible as evidence
against the originator of the communication or the person intended by the
originator to receive it unless

(a) the interception was
lawfully made; or

(b) the originator thereof or
the person intended by the originator to receive it has expressly consented to
the admission thereof;

but evidence obtained directly or
indirectly as a result of information acquired by interception of a private
communication is not inadmissible by reason only that the private communication
is itself inadmissible as evidence.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1),
the judge or magistrate presiding at any proceedings may refuse to admit
evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of information acquired by
interception of a private communication that is itself inadmissible as evidence
where he is of the opinion that the admission thereof would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.

(3) Where the judge or magistrate presiding
at any proceedings is of the opinion that a private communica-

[Page 126]

tion that, by virtue of
subsection (1), is inadmissible as evidence in the proceedings

(a) is relevant to a matter
at issue in the proceedings, and

(b) is inadmissible as
evidence therein by reason only of a defect of form or an irregularity in procedure,
not being a substantive defect or irregularity, in the application for or the
giving of the authorization under which such private communication was
intercepted,

he may, notwithstanding
subsection (1), admit such private communication as evidence in the
proceedings.

(3.1) A private communication that has been
intercepted and that is admissible as evidence may be admitted in any criminal
proceeding or in any civil proceeding or other matter whatever respecting which
the Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction, whether or not the criminal
proceeding or the civil proceeding or other matter relates to the offence
specified in the authorization pursuant to which the communication was
intercepted.

(4) A private communication that has been
lawfully intercepted shall not be received in evidence unless the party
intending to adduce it has given to the accused reasonable notice of his
intention together with

(a) a transcript of the private
communication, where it will be adduced in the form of a recording, or a statement
setting forth full particulars of the private communication, where evidence of
the private communication will be given viva voce; and

(b) a statement respecting
the time, place and date of the private communication and the parties thereto,
if known.

(5) Any information obtained by an
interception that, but for the interception would have been privileged, remains
privileged and inadmissible as evidence without the consent of the person
enjoying the privilege.

It is agreed by all that, though the enactment
of s. 178.16(3.1) was subsequent to the interception, the section is
applicable in the determination of this appeal.

As appears from a reading of the section, a
private communication is admissible as evidence if the interception was
lawfully made, and it is lawfully made if pursuant and in compliance with an
authorization under s. 178.13 .

[Page 127]

Accused takes the position that a private
communication is inadmissible “on the trial of one offence when it is obtained
after renewal of an authorization for a different offence at a time when there
were grounds to obtain an authorization for the offence with which the accused
is being tried”. Accused in taking this position reads s. 178.16(3.1) as
rendering admissible only “windfall” evidence and argues that it was not
intended “to render admissible private communications relating to an offence
which was not unexpected”.

McKay J. at trial disagreeing said:

It seems to me that in light of the
concession that the investigation into the heroin conspiracy continued on after
June 30th, 1976, and in light of the fact that the disputed evidence in this
case was discovered while valid renewals relating to the heroin conspiracy were
in existence, that the reasoning in Welsh and Iannuzzi (No. 6) applies,
and that the evidence is admissible, and I so hold.

R. v. Welsh and Iannuzzi (No. 6) reported at (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 363 is a decision of the Ontario
Court of Appeal. Zuber J.A. writing for the Court (Jessup, Arnup, Martin and
Wilson JJ.A.), when dealing with the issue relevant to this case,
concluded in the following terms, at pp. 373-74:

In my opinion, an interception complies
with both the Code and the authorization if it is made in respect to a
stated offence, i.e., for the purpose or object of investigating or
gathering evidence with respect to the named offence. The fact that the pursuit
of the objective of the authorization reveals evidence of other crimes does not
affect the lawful character of the interception. It cannot be said that the
evidence in this case is rendered inadmissible on this ground.

Prior to his conclusion, where no mention of a
distinction between “windfall” and “anticipated” evidence is made, he had
reviewed Canadian case law and then referred to an American case, United

[Page 128]

States v. Cox, 449
F.2d 679 (10th. Cir., 1971), and quoted Doyle Cir. J., at pp. 686-87:

Once the listening commences it becomes
impossible to turn it off when a subject other than one which is authorized is
overheard. It would be the height of unreasonableness to distinguish between
information specifically authorized and that which is unanticipated and which
develops in the course of an authorized search such as that involved here.
It would be irrational to hold that officers authorized to listen to
conversations about drug traffic, upon learning that a bank robbery is to
occur, must at once close down the project and not use the information to
prevent the robbery since the information is tainted. It would be demoralizing
to allow the bank to be robbed while the investigators stood by helpless to
prevent the occurrence. Harder cases can be imagined. For example, in
electronic surveillance of organized criminals involved in gambling,
information might be intercepted disclosing a conspiracy to commit murder.
Surely the officials must be empowered to use this information notwithstanding
the lack of specific prior authorization.

(Emphasis added.)

Zuber J.A. then added:

The force of these words is not diminished
by the procedural and constitutional differences which interlace this case.

The fact that s. 178.16(3.1) was
subsequently enacted and that no such distinction as that suggested by Circuit
Judge Doyle is to be found in the section should not be overlooked.

In the second line of subs. (3.1) it is stated
that an intercepted communication that is “admissible as evidence may be
admitted … whether or not the criminal proceeding … relates” to an offence
different than the one mentioned in the authorization. If the word “admissible”
is construed as meaning “admissible under the preceding subsections of
178”, then the section means nothing because Iannuzzi has already
interpreted unanticipated evidence revealing new offences as being included in
s. 178 prior to subs. (3.1). Consequently, the inclusion of subs. (3.1) of
the expression

[Page 129]

“may be admitted” necessarily adds something to
s. 178. If it adds the concept that the unanticipated statement (unlike Iannuzzi)
is related to suspected offences under investigation when the authorization is
taken out, then the effect of subs. (3.1) may be to make unnecessary any
compliance with s. 178 with reference to this second offence.

In the Court of Appeal for British Columbia
Lambert J.A., reading R. v. Rouse and Mclnroy (1977), 39 C.R.N.S. 135, R.
v. Miller and Thomas (No. 4) (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 128, and also R. v.
Welsh and Iannuzzi as adopting a distinction between “anticipated” and
“unanticipated” evidence said:

In short, it is my opinion that the rule
which permits the introduction of evidence with respect to an offence not
specified in the authorization, but which turns up unexpectedly in the course
of the interception, does not extend to evidence with respect to an offence
that is being investigated at the time of the authorization or at the time of a
renewal and that is intercepted after that authorization or that renewal. To
decide otherwise would permit a single authorization to spread to offences and
persons never contemplated by the authorizing judge who is charged with the
responsibility for applying the rigorous tests established by the Protection of
Privacy sections of the Criminal Code .

Craig J.A., reading R. v. Rouse and Mclnroy differently
took the following position:

I think that once a Court has authorized an
interception any intercepted conversation which discloses any criminal offence
is admissible in evidence in support of a charge relating to that offence even
though the authorization did not specifically authorize an interception for the
offence which has been incidentally disclosed in the interception.

I agree with Craig J.A., and I am of the view
that this appeal should succeed. The distinction that we are invited to make is
not found in the wording of s. 178.16(3.1) which is unambiguous.

[Page 130]

This is all the more significant as that
section was enacted after R. v. Rouse and Mclnroy and R. v.
Welsh and Iannuzzi. There are however other equally compelling reasons to
support Craig J.A.’s view.

The exclusionary rule’s purpose is to discourage
unlawful invasions of privacy. If the privacy is being invaded through a lawful
interception the exclusionary rule has lost its purpose. It is not the subject
matter of conversations that is sought to be protected, but the privacy of
those conversing. This is assuming, as is not contested in this case, that the initial
authorization had been lawfully obtained in good faith, that the investigation
on heroin, as was conceded, was still going on, and that the renewal for that
offence had been lawfully obtained. That admission by the respondent as regards
the renewal is of capital importance. Indeed for the renewal to be lawful the
judge must be given at the time of the renewal under s. 178.13(3) an
affidavit setting out, amongst other information,

…

(b) full particulars,
together with times and dates, when interceptions, if any, were made or
attempted under the authorization, and any information that has been
obtained by any interception,

(Emphasis added.)

The material before us does not reveal whether
the judge was told by the police that they had grounds to ask for a separate
authorization for a counterfeiting offence. But given the admission by
respondent, this case must be decided on the assumption that the judge was
informed through the affidavit of what was heard as regards that offence. It
might well be, though this need not, should not and is not decided on this
appeal, that if the police, on a renewal, were not to reveal such information
in this affidavit, the renewal might have been obtained irregularly, the
subsequent interceptions unlawful and any evidence obtained through such
interceptions may be inadmissible, be it evidence of the offence stated in the
authorization, or a fortiori, of any other offences, subject of course
to the discretion given judges under the

[Page 131]

section to admit unlawfully obtained
evidence.

To decide otherwise and to follow Lambert J.A.’s
reasoning would in my view create great difficulties. As one of many possible
illustrations, the following: The R.C.M.P. is lawfully intercepting on a heroin
investigation and unexpectedly overhears evidence of a murder.
Simultaneously the Municipal Police Force is investigating counterfeiting and
that very same murder but have been denied an authorization to intercept for
the murder but authorized for the counterfeiting. They also overhear evidence
of that murder. Under one authorization it is admissible but not under the
other?

Furthermore, what about the offences for which
an authorization to intercept can never be obtained because they are not listed
under s. 178.1. Were we to follow Lambert J.A.’s position, if evidence of
such an offence in the course of a lawful interception is revealed unexpectedly
it is admissible, as s. 178.16(3.1) does not distinguish between those
offences and those for which an authorization may be obtained. But if it is
expected, that evidence would be privileged even though the police officers
could not under the law obtain an authorization. Logic would then command that
s. 178.16(3.1) be limited only to proof of other offences listed at
s. 178.1 as open to interception. That position was adopted in R. v.
Patterson, Valois and Guindon (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 352. That in my view
would be reading a great deal into s. 178.16(3.1). To exclude evidence
pertaining to “unlisted” offences would in no way further the purpose of the
Act which is to protect the citizen from invasion of his privacy. That is being
achieved by s. 178.1 through denying the invasion where the sole purpose
is investigating one of those “unlisted” offences.

[Page 132]

I would therefore allow the appeal, quash the
acquittal entered by the Court of Appeal and restore the conviction.

The reasons of Ritchie, Dickson, Chouinard and
Wilson JJ. were delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—The issue is
whether an authorization to intercept private communications in respect of one
offence is sufficient to render lawful interceptions in respect of a different
offence, in circumstances where the interceptions in respect of the different
offence were anticipated at the time the authorization was obtained.

I The Facts

An authorization in respect of narcotics
offences was renewed for a second time on July 9, 1976. It is conceded that, in
so far as the narcotics offences are concerned, the authorization and renewals
were properly obtained, and that the investigation into the narcotics offences
continued after July 9, 1976. The accused Cosimo Commisso was not named in the
narcotics authorization nor in the renewals, nor was he suspected by the police
of being involved in the narcotics offences.

Prior to obtaining the second renewal, the
police became suspicious of a separate counterfeiting operation involving some
of the same people. By the date of the second renewal, the police thought they
had enough information to obtain an authorization in respect of the
counterfeiting offence. They did not make an application, however, because they
were advised by Crown counsel that this was not necessary. Cosimo Commisso was
not then suspected by the police of being involved in the counterfeiting
offence. The authorization and the renewals with respect to the narcotics
offences contained “basket clauses” which brought unknown persons within their
scope. The interceptions introduced in evidence against Cosimo Commisso were
all made subsequent to July 9, 1976.

[Page 133]

II The Exclusionary Rule

Cosimo Commisso’s conviction for conspiracy to
possess counterfeit money can only be supported if the wiretap evidence was
properly admitted. The majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
directed an acquittal be entered on the basis that the trial judge had erred in
admitting the evidence. The admissibility question depends on whether the
interceptions were lawfully made, that is to say, pursuant to the July 9, 1976
renewal.

In R. v. Wray, [1971] S.C.R. 272, the
majority of this Court decided illegally obtained evidence was admissible
unless highly prejudicial and of trifling weight. The Crown relies in part on
this and similar cases. With respect, in my view these authorities are of no
assistance here. We are not here dealing with common law but with a highly
structured statutory scheme. Parliament has clearly changed the common law rule
where interceptions of private communications are involved. Illegally obtained
evidence of private communications is generally inadmissible. The current
s. 178.16(1) reads in part as follows:

178.16 (1) A
private communication that has been intercepted is inadmissible as evidence
against the originator of the communication or the person intended by the
originator to receive it unless

(a) the interception was
lawfully made; or

(b) the originator thereof or
the person intended by the originator to receive it has expressly consented to
the admission thereof;

…

The only exceptions are consent and the
discretion under present s. 178.16(3) (former s. 178.16(2)) to admit
despite non-substantive defects or irregularities. Neither exception could
apply in this case. The only question is whether the interceptions

[Page 134]

sought to be introduced against Commisso were
lawfully made.

The unique legislative treatment of electronic
surveillance is a reflection of its nature. The modern technology is both
powerful and unobtrusive. The technology permits massive invasion of the
privacy with ease. It is also indiscriminate about the content of any
communication intercepted. Parliament has determined that this potential
constitutes a threat to individual freedom and the right to privacy. The
evidentiary rule of exclusion fortifies the stipulation that interceptions of
private communications are illegal unless specified conditions are met.

III The Balancing of Interests

Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code , on
Invasion of Privacy, balances two competing interests. Zuber J.A. of the
Ontario Court of Appeal expressed this aptly in R. v. Welsh and Iannuzzi
(No. 6) (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 363 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 369:

…Parliament had two objectives. The first
was to protect private communications by prohibiting interception and to render
inadmissible evidence obtained in violation of the statute. The second
objective, which balances the first, was to recognize the need to allow the
appropriate authorities, subject to specific controls, to intercept private
communications in the investigation of serious crime, and to adduce the
evidence thus obtained.

This legislation must be viewed and
interpreted with a full, fair and realistic appreciation of both these
objectives. The right to private communication cannot be diluted simply because
unlawful interceptions are made by honest men whose motives are simply to
detect crime. On the other hand, this legislation is not a legal briar patch
calculated to frustrate the legitimate aims of the prosecution.

The privacy interest is not served only by the
fact that s. 178.11 generally prohibits the interception of private
communications. In addition, s. 178.2 creates a separate offence of
disclosing a private communication. A person’s privacy is invaded when a
private communication is intercepted. A person’s privacy is invaded still
further if

[Page 135]

that intercepted private communication is
subsequently revealed to others. It is not appropriate to say that once a
private communication has been intercepted, whatever interest there was in
privacy has been lost. The privacy interest has a dual aspect. The question is:
when is that privacy interest lawfully superseded?

Part IV.1 makes it clear that the privacy
interest can be superseded in the interests of crime detection. Electronic
surveillance is a useful and legitimate tool of police investigation of serious
crime, but not in all circumstances. Electronic surveillance is an
investigative procedure of last resort. This is especially apparent in the
wording of s. 178.12(1)(g)ands. 178.13(1):

178.12 (1)
An application for an authorization shall be made ex parte and in
writing…

and shall be accompanied by an affidavit,
which may be sworn on the information and belief of a peace officer or public
officer deposing to the following matters, namely:

…

(g) whether other
investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or why it appears they
are unlikely to succeed or that the urgency of the matter is such that it would
be impractical to carry out the investigation of the offence using only other
investigative procedures.

178.13 (1)
An authorization may be given if the judge to whom the application is made is
satisfied

(a) that it would be in the best
interests of the administration of justice to do so; and

(b) that other investigative
procedures have been tried and have failed, other investigative procedures are
unlikely to succeed or the urgency of the matter is such that it would be
impractical to carry out the investigation of the offence using only other
investigative procedures.

Whether electronic surveillance is proper in a
given case is stipulated to be a matter for judicial determination and not a
matter for the police to decide.

[Page 136]

IV Section 178.16(3.1)

Subsequent to the interceptions in this case,
Parliament enacted s. 178.16(3.1). Despite the timing, counsel for
Commisso agrees the subsection could apply:

178.16. …

…

(3.1) A private communication that has been
intercepted and that is admissible as evidence may be admitted in any
criminal proceeding or in any civil proceeding or other matter whatever
respecting which the Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction, whether or not
the criminal proceeding or the civil proceeding or other matter relates to
the offence specified in the authorization pursuant to which the
communication was intercepted.

(Emphasis added.)

The Crown contends that subs. (3.1) makes the
evidence in this case admissible. I cannot agree. Subsection (3.1) imposes
a threshold requirement that the intercepted communication be admissible as
evidence. This relates back to s. 178.16(1) which provides that the
evidence is inadmissible unless the interception was lawfully made. Section 178.16(3.1)
simply restates the question: was the interception lawfully made. It does not
provide the answer.

It is true s. 178.16(3.1) does contemplate
evidence that will on occasion be admissible although it does not relate to the
offence specified in the authorization. The same can be said of
s. 178.22(2)(d) and (e), which have been in force since the
introduction of Part IV.1:

178.22 (1)
The Solicitor General of Canada shall, as soon as possible after the end of
each year, prepare a report…

…

(2) The report referred to in
subsection (1) shall, in relation to authorizations and interceptions made
thereunder, set forth

…

(d) the number of persons
identified in an authorization against whom proceedings were commenced at the
instance of the Attorney General of Canada in respect of

(i) an offence specified in the
authorization,

[Page 137]

(ii) an offence other than an offence
specified in the authorization but in respect of which an authorization may be
given, and

(iii) an offence in respect of which an
authorization may not be given;

(e) the number of persons not
identified in an authorization against whom proceedings were commenced at the
instance of the Attorney General of Canada in respect of

(i) an offence specified in such an
authorization,

(ii) an offence other than an offence
specified in such an authorization but in respect of which an authorization may
be given, and

(iii) an offence other than an offence
specified in such an authorization and for which no such authorization may be
given,

and whose commission or alleged commission
of the offence became known to a peace officer as a result of an interception
of a private communication under an authorization;

Neither s. 178.16(3.1) nor
s. 178.22(2) gives any help in defining or identifying of the occasions on
which an interception in relation to a non-specified offence will be regarded
as pursuant to the authorization.

Section 178.16(3.1) was enacted subsequent to R.
v. Welsh and Iannuzzi (No. 6), supra; R. v. Rouse and Mclnroy (1977),
36 C.C.C. (2d) 257 (B.C.C.A.); and R. v. Miller and Thomas (No. 4) (1975),
28 C.C.C. (2d) 128 (B.C. Co. Ct.), all of which held that an unanticipated interception
in relation to an offence not specified in the authorization was nonetheless
lawfully made. If it be assumed that s. 178.16(3.1) was enacted in
confirmation of these cases, the section nonetheless says nothing about
the situation that was not addressed in these cases—anticipated
interceptions.

V The Requirement to Specify the Offence

Counsel for the Crown makes the following submission:

It is respectfully submitted that the whole
premise of the legislation permitting interception of private communications
and their subsequent admission into evi-

[Page 138]

dence is that it is the conversation of persons
sought to be protected, not the subject matter of the conversations that
is sought to be protected.

(Emphasis added.)

My reading of the statute is to the contrary.
The subject matter of the communication is indeed a critical factor. Section
178.2, which generally prohibits disclosure of a private communication,
contains no provision that once interception of certain persons is authorized,
everything may be disclosed. More importantly, the provisions regarding the
application for and the giving of an authorization are throughout linked to a
specified offence. This applies equally to the wording at the time the
interceptions were made as to the current wording.

(Emphasis added.)

[Page 140]

On the appellant’s argument, once an
authorization is validly obtained in respect of one offence, it is sufficient
to cover interceptions in respect of any other offence. This would render the
language directed toward the specified offence essentially meaningless. That
cannot, in my view, be the proper construction of the statute.

It is clear there is a particular reason for
linking an authorization to a specified offence or offences. Electronic
surveillance has been deemed by the statute to be an investigative procedure of
use only when other investigative procedures have been tried and failed, or are
unlikely to succeed, or are impractical because of the urgency of the matter
(s. 178.13(1)(b)). Whether electronic surveillance is in fact justified
can only be determined in relation to a specific offence. The result of the
Crown’s argument would be that electronic surveillance could and would be used
in respect of an unspecified offence even where other investigative procedures
could still prove fruitful. That is not consistent with s.178.13(1).

VI The Anticipated/Unanticipated Distinction

The majority of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal based their decision on a distinction between two different
circumstances in which an interception could be made in respect of an offence
not specified in an authorization. They concluded that while an unanticipated
interception respecting another offence was made pursuant to authorization, an anticipated
interception respecting another offence was not, and hence was inadmissible. It
was on this ground that Lambert J.A. distinguished R. v. Welsh and Iannuzzi
(No. 6), supra, R. v. Rouse and Mclnroy, supra, R. v. Miller and Thomas (No.
4), supra.

In R. v. Welsh and Iannuzzi (No. 6), Zuber
J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal made the following comment, at p. 373:

[Page 141]

American Courts have had a longer
experience in this area of law. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act of 1968, Title III, 18 U.S.C. §2510 et seq., 82 Stat. 211, is
generally similar to Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code . The question of
interception of communications which disclose evidence related to offences
other than the one named in the authorization has attracted comment in American
cases. In United States v. Cox (1971), 449 F.2d 679, Doyle C.J.,
speaking for the United States Court of Appeals, 10th Circuit, said at pp. 686-7:

Once the listening commences it becomes
impossible to turn it off when a subject other than one which is authorized is
overheard. It would be the height of unreasonableness to distinguish between
information specifically authorized and that which is unanticipated and
which develops in the course of an authorized search such as that involved
here. It would be irrational to hold that officers authorized to listen to
conversations about drug traffic, upon learning that a bank robbery is to
occur, must at once close down the project and not use the information to
prevent the robbery since the information is tainted. It would be demoralizing
to allow the bank to be robbed while the investigators stood by helpless to
prevent the occurrence. Harder cases can be imagined. For example, in
electronic surveillance of organized criminals involved in gambling,
information might be intercepted disclosing a conspiracy to commit murder.
Surely the officials must be empowered to use this information notwithstanding
the lack of specific prior authorization.

The force of these words is not diminished
by the procedural and constitutional differences which interlace this case.

(Emphasis added.)

Elsewhere in United States v. Cox, the
10th Circuit United States Court of Appeals reiterated that it was directing
its attention to the question of unanticipated interceptions, at p. 687:

…we do not [uphold the statute] upon the
basis that the nature and probable consequence of authorized wiretapping is
discovery of unanticipated and undescribed communications. The very nature of
this form of invasion is conducive to producing unexpected information.

[Page 142]

American cases distinguish between anticipated
and unanticipated interceptions primarily on the basis of good faith; United
States v. Marion, 535 F.2d 697 (2nd Cir., 1976); United States v.
Brodson, 528 F.2d 214 (7th Cir., 1975); United States v. Aloi, 449
F. Supp. 698 (E.D.N.Y., 1977); United States v. Pine, 473 F. Supp. 349
(D. Md., 1978). The Crown concedes that if the authorization for the specified
offence were obtained in bad faith, the authorization would be invalid and not
cover unspecified offences. However, the Crown sets the good faith test too
low. The Crown submits that an authorization is obtained in good faith as long as
there is a bona fide investigation into the specified offence. In my
view, that is insufficient. I would also say that there would be bad faith, and
an abuse of the statutory scheme, where the police, although investigating both
the specified and unspecified offences, were primarily interested in the
unspecified offence for which they could not get an authorization. In most
cases it would be virtually impossible to prove that the police were more
interested in the unnamed than the named offence. The only viable way to
control what American cases label “subterfuge searches” is to say that if an
offence is suspected at the time an authorization or renewal is given, an
authorization must specify that offence. If it does not, a communication with
respect to that offence is not lawfully intercepted in accordance with an
authorization. The above-cited American cases adopt this view by equating good
faith with inadvertance.

The American cases must, of course, be
approached with some caution because of the different statutory and
constitutional underpinnings. Is there any basis in the Canadian statute for
drawing a distinction between anticipated and unanticipated interceptions? I
think the answer is in the affirmative. Note the particular wording of
s. 178.13(2)(a):

178.13 …

…

[Page 143]

(2) An authorization shall

(a) state the offence in respect
of which private communications may be intercepted;

(Emphasis added.)

In R. v. Welsh and Iannuzzi (No. 6), supra, the
Ontario Court of Appeal interpreted “in respect of” to mean for the purpose or
object of investigating the named offence (at pp. 373-74). If interception is
for that purpose, it is lawful. Where the police suspect a crime in addition to
the named offence, the interceptions have a dual purpose. In the present case
interceptions purportedly under the July 9, 1976 renewal were made both in the
search for evidence of narcotics offences and in the search for evidence of
counterfeiting offences. I would say the former was authorized, the latter was
not.

VII Conclusion

I conclude that where the police suspect an
offence at the time of an application for an authorization or renewal, an
interception is not lawfully made in accordance with an authorization unless
the suspected offence is specified. The statute demands specification of the
offence to enable a judicial determination of whether electronic surveillance
is a proper tool of crime detection. If the interception has not thus been
given judicial approval, the statute mandates that the privacy interest in
preventing disclosure is paramount.

I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the order
of the British Columbia Court of Appeal directing that an acquittal be entered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR NEW
BRUNSWICK

Criminal law—Procedure—Separate
informations—Joint trial—No jurisdiction to try together separate
informations—New trials ordered.

Appellants were charged in separate
informations of hunting with a light contrary to s. 24 of the New Brunswick Game Act. Another
person was also charged in a third information of wilfully obstructing police
officers in the execution of their duty contrary to s. 118 (a) of the
Criminal Code . All charges arose out of the same incident. By agreement
between the counsel of the prosecution and counsel for the defence, the
defendants were tried together. The appellants’ convictions in Provincial Court were upheld by the Court
of Queen’s Bench and the Court of Appeal. This appeal is to determine whether
the trial judge had jurisdiction to try more than one information at the same
time.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and new trials ordered.

Even with the consent of counsel of the
parties, a trial judge is without jurisdiction to try together separate
informations or indictments. The principle applies to charge laid under the Criminal
Code  or under provincial statutes unless those statutes expressly provide
otherwise.

APPEAL from a judgment of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal
(1981), 37 N.B.R. (2d) 72, 97 A.P.R. 72, dismissing the accused’s appeal from a
judgment of the Court of Queen’s Bench, Trial Division (1980), 33 N.B.R. (2d)
50, 80 A.P.R. 50, upholding the convictions of the accused. Appeal allowed.

Gary A. Miller and J. Brian Neill, for
the appellants.

Paul Thériault, Q.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—The two appellants were charged in
separate informations with hunting game by means or with the assistance of a
light, contrary to the provisions of s. 24 of the Game Act, R.S.N.B.
1973, c. G-1. The informations were identical save only for the name of the
person accused in each one. A third person, Beulah Phillips, was charged in a
third information with wilfully obstructing police officers in the execution of
their duty contrary to the provisions of s. 118 (a) of the Criminal
Code . All charges arose out of the same incident. By consent all three
defendants were tried at the same time on common evidence. The two appellants
were convicted and their appeal was dismissed in the Court of Appeal. Beulah
Phillips did not appeal to this Court and her position is not relevant to these
proceedings.

At trial and in the Court of Appeal the matter
was disposed of on the merits. In this Court, the

[Page 163]

merits were not argued. Instead, new grounds not
raised below were advanced and they may be most conveniently set out by quoting
from the appellants’ factum, where it is stated:

The conviction of the Appellants was made
without jurisdiction in that their trial was a nullity for the reasons that:

(a) Each of the Appellants was charged in a
separate information for an offence contrary to section 24 of the New
Brunswick Game Act and each of their trials was held together with no
motion being made to read in the evidence heard in relation to one charge as
constituting the evidence on the other charge;

(b) Each of the Appellants was tried with
one Beulah Phillips who was charged with an offence contrary to
section 118  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, and there is no
jurisdiction for a Provincial Court Judge to try a Criminal Code  offence
together with an information charging an offence under the New Brunswick Game Act.

It should be noted that no objection was taken
to the informations themselves. Each information charged one accused with one
offence. Counsel for the appellants argued, however, that the fact that the
trial judge tried the informations together, even though the parties consented,
rendered the whole proceedings void. Alternatively, it was contended that,
whatever the result of a joint trial of two informations under the Summary
Convictions Act of New Brunswick, the joinder at trial of the third information under the Criminal
Code  was fatal. Counsel for the Crown contended that, at most, the joinder
for trial of the separate informations was a mere irregularity against which
the court had the power to relieve. Since it was asserted that no prejudice was
shown and that there was clear evidence of the guilt of the appellants adduced
before the trial judge, the Court should dismiss the appeals.

There is judicial support for the appellants’
position that there is no jurisdiction to try more than one indictment or
information at the same time. In Crane v. Public Prosecutor, [1921] 2
A.C. 299,

[Page 164]

two accused charged on separate indictments were
tried together. Although it is permissible at common law to charge two accused
jointly on the same indictment, the House of Lords held that a single trial on
more than one indictment was a nullity. Lord Atkinson said, at p. 321:

When an accused person has pleaded “Not
guilty” to the offences charged against him in an indictment, and another
accused person has pleaded “Not guilty” to the offence or offences charged
against him in another separate and independent indictment it is, I have always
understood, elementary in criminal law, that the issues raised by those two
pleas cannot be tried together.

This principle was applied in R. v. Dennis;
R. v. Parker, [1924] 1 K.B. 867, where it was held in the Court of Criminal
Appeal that a single trial could not be held on more than one indictment even
with the consent of the parties. Jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent.

The rule has been followed in Canada in cases of
multiple accused: R. v. Theirlyock (1928), 50 C.C.C. 296 (Alta. C.A.); R.
v. Hart and Kozaruk (1929), 51 C.C.C. 145 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. Sargent (1943),
79 C.C.C. 384 (Man. C.A.); R. v. Gray (1947), 4 C.R. 363 (Ont. C.A.); Kezar
v. The Queen (1960), 132 C.C.C. 54 (Que. C.A.). It has also been applied in cases of a single accused charged on
more than one indictment or information: R. v. Cassidy (1927), 49
C.C.C. 93 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Longo (1941), 76 C.C.C. 142 (Ont.
C.A.); R. v. Johns (1945), 84 C.C.C. 213 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Elkins (1961),
35 C.R. 314 (B.C.C.A.); Brown v. The Queen (1961), 46 M.P.R. 321
(N.B.C.A.). The rule has been used to quash convictions on summary conviction
offences under provincial statutes: R. v. McDonald (1928), 50 C.C.C. 65
(Ont. Co. Ct.); R. v. Bannister (1954), 19 C.R. 419 (Ont. Co. Ct.); Peterson
v. Peterson, [1970] 5 C.C.C. 315 (Ont. H.C.); R. v. Armstrong (1977),
28 N.S.R. (2d) 431 (Co. Ct.). The overwhelming weight of authority in Canada,
based upon the Crane case, supra, is against a joint trial of
more than one indictment or information.

[Page 165]

A trial proceeds on the basis of one indictment
or one information which may or may not, according to the relevant statutory
provisions, contain more than one count. Early text writers referred to the
indictment as the foundation of the record, that is, the document by which
proceedings are commenced. Stephen’s History of the Criminal Law of England,
vol. 1, 1883, states at p. 274:

The indictment is the foundation of the
record in all criminal cases, and is indeed the only document connected with
the trial which in all cases is in writing. It is in the form of a statement
upon oath by the grand jury that the prisoner committed the offence with which he
is charged.

And at page 275:

It is enough to say that in all common
cases the pleadings in a criminal trial have always consisted, and still
consist, of an indictment engrossed on parchment, and a plea given by the
accused person orally in open court, of guilty or not guilty.

In all of the earlier writings on the subject of
indictments and informations and the procedures involved in their presentment
and trial, it was assumed that trial proceedings were founded upon a single
indictment or information. From very early times in England it was possible to join more than one person as an accused in an
indictment: see Blackstones Commentaries, vol. 4, 18th. ed., 1829, at
p. 301, where an indictment is described as a written accusation against
“one or more persons”. This practice has been followed in Canada. I have not, however, found any
early authority for the joinder for trial of more than one information or
indictment.

The Crane rule against the joinder for
trial of separate indictments or informations has recently been questioned in Canada. In R. v. Levesque, [1967] 2
C.C.C. 49 (Que. C.A.), one
accused was charged on two separate indictments with two separate offences
arising out of the same transaction. The offences could have been charged as
separate counts on one indictment (see s. 520  of the Criminal Code ).
Since counsel consented to

[Page 166]

the joint trial and since there was no prejudice
to the accused it was held that the joint trial amounted only to an
irregularity which was corrected by consent. Convictions on the two separate
indictments were upheld. This case is, of course, distinguishable from the case
at bar in that it involved the joint trial of two indictments against one
accused. The present case involves two informations against two separate
accused.

In R. v. Kennedy; R. v. Dowdall (1971), 3
C.C.C. (2d) 58, the Ontario Court of Appeal (MacKay, Kelly and Arnup JJ.A.)
refused to apply the Crane principle in a case where two accused were
charged on separate informations with offences arising out of the same
transaction. The two informations were tried together by consent. The first
issue before us in the case at bar was exactly the issue raised in the Kennedy
case.

In Kennedy, Kelly J.A. observed that the
two appellants were engaged in a joint entreprise and that they could have been
jointly charged under the Criminal Code . He went on to point out that,
had they been so charged, the course of their defence would have been the same
and that no prejudice would have resulted. He considered that, since any number
of persons can be jointly charged with the commission of the same offence and
since, under the Criminal Code , several offences can be included in one
information (with the power of a judge in a proper case to order separate
trials of separate accused persons), the joinder of the informations in one
trial was a mere irregularity. As there was no prejudice to either accused, the
convictions were upheld. Kelly J.A. was of the view that the provisions in the
present Code were expressive of an intention to encourage joint trials
where no prejudice would result. He considered that narrow technical objections
should not

[Page 167]

obstruct this process. He said, at p. 63:

The anomalous situation disclosed by this
appeal is that the appellants, who were tried in a manner to which their
counsel agreed, at a trial to the conduct of which they have raised no other
objection, seek to have the convictions nullified solely because both
appellants were not charged in a single information.

I am fully conscious of the fact that many
cases have held that jurisdiction if otherwise absent cannot be conferred by
consent. I do not attempt to support the convictions on that basis. Rather do I
question the universality of the rule that essays to state that any joint trial
of two indictments is a nullity.

The authorities on which it is sought to
support the appeal have their origin in times long before the advent of the Code.
In view of the extensive provisions in the Code for the joinder of
offences and offenders, subject to the overriding power of the Court to order
separation when justice requires it, I do not consider that what occurred in
these cases resulted in the proceedings being of necessity a nullity—there was
at most an irregularity, the gravity of which is to be measured by the extent
to which the fair trial of the accused persons was prejudiced. Since neither
appellant suffered any prejudice in the defence advanced by him, it follows in
my view that the irregularity is one with respect to which this Court may invoke
the provision of s. 592 (1)(b)(ii) (am. 1968-69, c. 38,
s. 60(1)) of the Code.

Arnup J.A., in expressing agreement with Kelly
J.A., said at p. 67:

I am further of the view that procedural
changes in the Criminal Code , including those mentioned by my brother
Kelly, have been such as to enable one to discern a legislative intention that
criminal procedure should be expeditious, convenient, sensible and not unduly
technical, but subject always to the overriding duty of the Court to ensure
that the interests of the accused are fully protected and that his right to a
fair trial is in no way prejudiced. A similar policy is in general discernible
from the more recent decisions of the criminal Courts both in England and in Canada.

He went on to observe that the rule against the
joint trial of separate informations was ‘judgemade’ and could be relaxed and
modified with

[Page 168]

changing attitudes and conditions. He recognized
the existence of authorities heretofore considered to be binding upon the
courts, but did not feel that the requirements of stare decisis bound
the court to set aside the convictions “because the proceedings were initiated
by two pieces of paper instead of one, even though we are completely satisfied
that there was not the slightest prejudice to either accused nor any reason to
question the correctness, on the facts, of their conviction”.

The Kennedy case has not been uniformly
followed in Canada. In 1980,
the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the convictions of one accused based on two
informations tried together in the case of R. v. Torangeau (1980), 53
C.C.C. (2d) 574, since there was no prejudice to the accused. Apart from that
case, however, it is interesting to note that only one case was cited to us in
which Kennedy was applied to uphold convictions based on one trial of
separate informations. In R. v. Yeadon (1979), 36 N.S.R. (2d) 271, the
Nova Scotia County Court upheld two convictions under the provincial Motor
Vehicles Act even though the single accused was tried on two separate informations
at the same time. The provincial Act incorporated the summary conviction
procedures of the Criminal Code . Another Nova Scotia County Court judge
declined to follow Kennedy in R. v. Armstrong, supra, as did the
British Columbia Supreme Court in R. v. Mansell and Veilleux (1971), 18
C.R.N.S. 398. Even the lower courts of Ontario have declined to follow the decision of their own Court of Appeal
in Kennedy: see R. v. Kosowan (1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d) 73 (Ont.
H.C.), and R. v. Burns (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 316 (Ont. Co. Ct.).

The question before this Court may be simply
stated. Should we accept the reasoning of the

[Page 169]

Ontario Court of Appeal in Kennedy and
discard the rule enunciated in Crane which has been generally accepted
in Canadian courts since that time, or should we confirm the rule in Crane as
a correct statement of the law to be applied in Canada?

In answering this question, I say at the outset
that I am in full agreement with the learned justices of the Ontario Court of
Appeal when they say that joint offenders should be jointly charged and jointly
tried. I agree that any prejudice which may arise upon such a joint trial is
guarded against by the exercise in a proper case of the judicial power to sever
counts and order separate trials. That is precisely what is provided for in the
Criminal Code , both for indictable and summary conviction offences and,
in the case of indictments, it has been the law for centuries. Approving such a
proposition does not, however, touch the question facing us here or which faced
the Ontario Court of Appeal in the Kennedy case.

The difficulty with the question in this case is
that a criminal trial has for centuries proceeded on the basis of one
indictment or one information. So basic to the law of criminal procedure was
this principle that the early text writers found no need even to comment on it,
although the principle is implicit throughout their writings (see, for example,
Stephen’s History of the Law of England and Kenny’s Outlines of
Criminal Law, 19th ed., 1966). It is not, therefore, surprising that Lord
Atkinson in the Crane case, supra, referred to the principle as
‘elementary’.

I would be reluctant to rest my decision in this
case solely on the basis of ancient practice. I agree with the Ontario Court of
Appeal that there is no reason why we should be required to be bound by
authority which serves no real purpose and rests upon no sound principle
applicable in a modern society. We must not, however, cast aside rules merely
because they are of long standing or

[Page 170]

because they may seem in certain cases to be
inconvenient. Can it be said then that the rule against joint trials of
separate indictments or informations serves no purpose and is based on no sound
principle?

The joinder of two or more indictments or
informations for trial raises fundamentally different problems from those which
arise in the joint trials of several persons accused under one indictment or
information. An elaborate procedure is provided under the Criminal Code  covering
joint trials but no such procedure is to be found to deal with questions
arising upon a joinder of indictments. Consider, for example, the application
of the rule that an accused person is not compellable as a witness at his own
trial. Where two accused are charged on separate indictments or informations
and tried together in one proceeding there is nothing to prevent the Crown from
calling one accused as a witness to testify with respect to the indictment or
information charging the other accused because, in respect of that indictment,
he does not enjoy the protection accorded an accused person. The risk of
prejudice is immediately apparent and the Crown would in this way obtain an
advantage not permitted or even contemplated by the Code provisions. It
could be argued no doubt that the evidence so given would be admissible only
against the co-accused but on what principle it could be so limited may be
somewhat obscure. Certainly any protection the witness might claim under
s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, would be
rendered completely illusory. Such protection against the use of the evidence
against him applies only to future proceedings and not to those in progress
when the evidence is given. One may consider as well the case of an accused
charged in two separate indictments or informations with different offences. It
may be advantageous for him to testify with respect to one charge but not to
the other. Such an advantage is lost if both indictments are tried together.
This problem to be sure may arise where an accused is charged with separate
counts on one indictment or information, but where this occurs he enjoys the
protection of the detailed procedural provisions of the Code relating to
severance. While in retrospect, that is to say,

[Page 171]

from the vantage point of the appellate courts,
it may be possible in any given case to conclude that no prejudice resulted
from a joinder for trial of two indictments or informations, it would be
impossible for a trial judge to foresee at the outset of the trial all possible
consequences of such a joinder. The dangers then of prejudice and injustice are
such that they outweigh any advantage or consideration of efficiency thought to
be gained by the joinder.

It should also be pointed out that the common
law rule against joint trials of separate indictments or informations has been
incorporated by implication into the Criminal Code . Throughout the Code,
reference is made to trial on the indictment or the information.
Even the provisions in relation to multiple counts and severance indicate that
a trial is to proceed on one indictment or information. If it had been
contemplated by Parliament that more than one information or indictment could
be tried at the same time, these provisions for joinder or severance would have
been unnecessary.

In my opinion, therefore, the rule expressed in
the Crane case and generally accepted in Canadian courts should be
followed. I would hold that a trial judge is without jurisdiction to try
together separate informations or indictments under the Criminal Code . This
result will not complicate or delay the due administration of justice. There
are adequate means provided in the Criminal Code  for the joinder of
accused and for the joinder of counts to avoid having to conduct more trials
than are necessary. Even at the beginning of a trial, where there are separate
informations or indictments that should have been charged jointly, it is open
to the trial judge in his discretion to permit the amend-

[Page 172]

ment of one document to include the charges or
accused from the other in a proper case: see Morena v. R.; Iacampo v. R., [1977]
C.A. 140.

As noted earlier, the appellants in the present
case were charged under a provincial statute and the procedures of the Summary
Convictions Act of New Brunswick govern. In my view, the same reasoning above with respect to the Criminal
Code  applies to provincial statutes unless those statutes expressly provide
otherwise. No such provision may be found in the New Brunswick Act.

For the above reasons, it is my opinion that
this appeal should be allowed, the convictions set aside, and new trials
ordered on the separate informations. It is therefore unnecessary to consider
the second ground of appeal.

Appeal allowed and new trials ordered.

APPLICATIONS for judicial release or stay of
sentence. Applications denied.

Howard Rubin, for the applicant Lyons.

Prevedoros.

S.R. Fainstein, for the respondent.

The following is the judgment delivered by

THE COURT—These are applications for judicial
release or stay of sentence made by the applicants, Kristine Lyons and John
Prevedoros, pending the judgment of this Court on their respective appeals in
which judgment was reserved on June 23, 1983.

Following the hearing of these appeals in this
Court, the applicants made applications for judicial release to the Court of
Appeal of British Columbia
pursuant to s. 608  of the Criminal Code  of Canada. These applications were heard by Hinkson J.A. in Chambers and
dismissed. Review

[Page 632]

was then sought under s. 608.1 and the
application for review was declined by the Chief Jutice of British Columbia. It is against this
background that these applications now before this Court must be considered.

If it be assumed that this Court had
jurisdiction to respond to these applications (as counsel for the applicants
have so ably argued), this Court would decline to grant the orders sought but
in doing so would wish to be understood as construing the decision of Hinkson
J.A. in denying judicial release as one which is based directly on the
circumstances of these applicants and not as an application of a general
proposition that judicial release should not be granted upon a reserve of
judgment in an appeal by the Supreme Court of Canada.

These applications are therefore denied.

Applications denied.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Procedure—Private
prosecution—Stay of proceedings—Mandamus to compel hearing on
informations—Whether Attorney General has power to stay proceedings any time
after laying of information—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 as amended, ss.
2, 455, 455.3, 503, 508.

Appellant laid informations before a Justice
of the Peace alleging the commission of indictable offences. Prior to the commencement
of the hearing by the Justice of the Peace to determine whether process should
issue, the Attorney General stayed the proceedings pursuant to his authority
under s. 508  of the Criminal Code . The Supreme Court of Ontario denied
appellant’s application for an order for mandamus directing the Justice of the
Peace to proceed with a hearing under s. 455.3 of the Code and the Court
of Appeal upheld the decision. This appeal is to determine whether the Attorney
General is empowered by s. 508(1)  to direct a stay of proceedings after an
information has been received but before the Justice of the Peace has completed
an inquiry under s. 455.3 .

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Section 508  of the Criminal Code  did
not empower the Attorney General to stay proceedings at any time after an
information was laid. The power to stay starts only after a summons or warrant
is issued. The laying of an information does not amount to the “finding of an
information”; an information is found only after the Justice of the Peace has
made a decision to issue process. The power to stay, while necessary,
encroaches upon a citizen’s fundamental and historical right to inform under
oath a Justice of the Peace of the commission of a crime. Parliament has seen
fit to impose upon

[Page 145]

the justice an obligation to “hear and
consider” the allegation and make a determination. In the absence of a clear
and unambiguous text taking away that right, and considering a text of law that
is open to an interpretation that favours the exercise of that right while
amply accommodating the policy consideration that supports the power to stay,
the right should be protected.

application for an order of mandamus. Appeal allowed.

intervener.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—Appellant Dowson applied to a Justice
of the Supreme Court of Ontario for an order of mandamus directed to a Justice
of the Peace to proceed with a hearing pursuant to s. 455.3  of the Criminal
Code  on nine charges: three of forgery, three of uttering forged documents,
and three of conveying false messages. The application was dismissed as was
also his appeal from that decision to the Court of Appeal. Dowson now appeals
to this Court.

On April 25, 1980, the appellant laid an
information before a Justice of the Peace concerning allegedly forged letters.
Under s. 455.3 of the Criminal Code  a justice who receives an
information (other than an information laid under s. 455.1 ) shall hold a
hearing to determine whether process should issue against the accused. At the
request of the Attorney General of Ontario, this

[Page 146]

hearing was adjourned to permit the Attorney
General to complete his investigation into the matter.

On June 26, 1980, a new information was laid
and received. It charged an officer of the R.C.M.P. with forgery, uttering
false documents and conveying false messages contrary to ss. 326(1) , 330  and
324  of the Criminal Code . The hearing under s. 455.3  was again adjourned
and eventually resumed on October 30, 1980. At this time, counsel for the
Attorney General of Ontario, pursuant to s. 508 of the Code, directed
the clerk of the court to make an entry on the record that the proceedings were
stayed by direction of the Attorney General. His Worship Justice of the Peace
Allen refused the appellant’s application for an adjournment and discontinued
the proceedings.

The appellant then applied for the order of
mandamus.

STATUTORY PROVISIONS

455. Any one who, on reasonable and
probable grounds, believes that a person has committed an indictable offence
may lay an information in writing and under oath before a justice, and the
justice shall receive the information, where it is alleged

(a) that the person has committed,
anywhere, an indictable offence that may be tried in the province in which the
justice resides, and that the person

(i) is or is believed to be, or

(ii) resides or is believed to reside,
within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice;

(b) that the person, wherever he may
be, has committed an indictable offence within the territorial jurisdiction of
the justice;

(c) that the person has, anywhere,
unlawfully received property that was unlawfully obtained within the
territorial jurisdiction of the justice; or

(d) that the person has in his
possession stolen property within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice.

455.3 (1) A
justice who receives an information, other than an information laid before him
under section 455.1, shall

(a) hear and consider, ex parte,

(i) the allegations of the informant, and

(ii) the evidence of witnesses, where he
considers it desirable or necessary to do so; and

[Page 147]

(b) where he considers that a case
for so doing is made out, issue, in accordance with this section, either a
summons or a warrant for the arrest of the accused to compel the accused to
attend before him to answer to a charge of an offence.

508. (1) The
Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may, at any
time after an indictment has been found and before judgment, direct the
clerk of the court to make an entry on the record that the proceedings are
stayed by his direction, and when the entry is made all proceedings on the
indictment shall be stayed accordingly and any recognizance relating to the
proceedings is vacated.

(2) Proceedings stayed in accordance with
subsection (1) may be recommenced, without laying a new charge or preferring a
new indictment, as the case may be, by the Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose giving notice of the recommencement to the
clerk of the court in which the stay of proceedings was entered, but where no
such notice is given within one year after the entry of the stay of
proceedings, the proceedings shall be deemed never to have been commenced.

(Emphasis added.)

The appellant raised two issues:

1. Is the Attorney General of Ontario empowered
by s. 508(1)  of the Criminal Code  to direct a stay of proceedings after
an information has been received but before the Justice of the Peace has
completed an inquiry under s. 455.3  to determine whether process should issue
against the accused?

2. Are The Ministry of the Attorney General
Act and The Crown Attorneys Act ultra vires in so far as they
authorize the Attorney General of Ontario to direct a stay of proceedings after
an information has been laid but before the Justice of the Peace has completed
an inquiry under s. 455.3 ?

At the hearing before this Court, the Crown took
the position that it did not rely on provincial legislation to support its
position. This being so, we are left with only the first issue.

[Page 148]

THE JUDGMENTS

Supreme Court of Ontario

Montgomery J. concluded that “All criminal
proceedings are commenced by the laying of an information. Once proceedings are
commenced, the Attorney General may intervene and conduct or stay proceedings.”
He relied on The Department of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 116, The
Crown Attorneys Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 101, the historical origins of the
expression “finding an indictment” in 1886, R.S.C. 1886, c. 174, s. 2, paras. (c.)
and (d.), and, amongst others, R. v. Leonard, ex parte Graham (1962),
133 C.C.C. 262, a decision of the Court of Appeal of Alberta, and the fact that
the Attorney General was the “chief law officer for the Crown and the duly
constituted public authority charged with the responsibility for the
administration of justice in the province”.

The Court of Appeal

The Court of Appeal, per Howland C.J.O.
adopted the reasons of Montgomery J. and added three observations of its own.
They are essentially as follows:

(1) Any ambiguity in the expression “an
indictment has been found” is resolved by the definition of “indictment” in s.
2 and by the context in which the expression occurs, especially s. 508(2). This
section provides that proceedings stayed in accordance with s. 508(1)  “may be
recommenced, without laying a new charge or preferring a new indictment”. It
thus assimilates laying a charge with finding an indictment.

(2) Under s. 732.1 the Attorney General has the
power to stay proceedings any time after the laying of an information which
charges a summary conviction offence. It would be anomalous to deny him this
power with respect to indictable offences, especially since he is charged by
statute with the ultimate responsibility for the conduct of prosecutions: see The
Crown Attorneys Act, ss. 11 and 12.

[Page 149]

(3) As Chief law officer of the Crown, the
Attorney General has always had the power to control the issue of process in
the name of the Crown. His decision is not reviewable by the courts.

Section 2  of the Criminal Code  defines
“indictment” and “count”:

“indictment” includes

(a) information, presentment and a
count therein

(b) a plea, replication or other
pleading, and

(c) any record;

“count” means a charge in an information or
indictment;

Section 503 defines the expression “Finding an
indictment”

503. For the
purposes of this Part, finding an indictment includes

(a) preferring an indictment, and

(b) presentment of an indictment by
a grand jury.

As the Attorney General can stay under s. 508 
“at any time after an indictment has been found and before judgment”, when
substituting the word “information” for the word “indictment” the question to
be answered in order to address the issue is whether an information is “found”
upon the mere “laying” of the information or only when the Justice of the Peace
has decided to issue a process, warrant or summons, following a hearing under
s. 455.3.

Appellant takes issue with the Alberta Court of
Appeal’s decision in R. v. Leonard, ex parte Graham, supra, and takes
the primary position that the Attorney General cannot enter a stay of
proceedings while the matter is in Provincial Court. In that case the issue before the Court was whether the Attorney
General could intervene to withdraw an information for an indictable offence
that had been laid by a private prosecutor. In obiter Smith C.J.A.,
rendering judgment for the Court said, at p. 266:

[Page 150]

My view is that the included meaning of the
word ‘information’ in s-s. (20) of s. 2 of the Code is applicable and
relevant, and is not doubtful or ambiguous and I therefore consider that in the
case of a preliminary hearing of an information for an indictable offence, s.
490 must be read as meaning what it would mean if the word ‘information’ were
substituted therein for the word ‘indictment’. In other words, for this
purpose, the word ‘indictment’ therein, in my view, must be read as
comprehending not only an indictment but also an information. The word
‘information’ in s-s. (20) of s. 2 , cannot refer to a criminal information
because criminal informations have been abolished by s. 488  of the Criminal
Code .

Appellant refers us to two publications, one
written prior to the Leonard decision (D.E. Greenfield, “The
position of the stay in Magistrate’s Court”, (1961-62) 4 Crim. L.Q. 373) and a
more recent one in 1974 (Connie Sun, “The Discretionary Power to Stay Criminal
Proceedings”, (1974) 1 Dalhousie L.J. 482). I have read these articles and have
found therein nothing to convince me that I should disagree with that passage
of Smith C.J.A.’s remarks that I have first quoted.

Appellant’s subsidiary position, supported by
intervener, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, one with which I am in
agreement and would so find, is that, because a prosecution commences only
after the Justice of the Peace has made a decision to issue process, an
information has been found only after that decision.

Before substantiating this finding, I should
like to comment on Montgomery J.’s reference to the predecessor sections
defining “indictment”, “count” and “finding an indictment” prior to the Code
of 1953-54. I do not know to what extent reliance was put on the wording of
those sections from 1886 to 1953. Indeed Montgomery J. does not say. As I am of
the view that the wording of the predecessor sections is no longer since 1953
of any relevance to the question we have to answer, I must assume that
Montgomery J.’s reference to them is an indication that he was of a contrary
view.

There is no need to reproduce here the text of
those sections as they evolved over the years but it is sufficient to look at
them as they read in 1886, a

[Page 151]

text specifically referred to by Montgomery
J., and in 1927, the form in which those definitions were till the enactment of
the Code of 1953.

Revised Statutes of Canada 1886, c. 174:

2. …

…

(c.) The expression ‘indictment’
includes information, inquisition and presentment as well as indictment, and
also any plea, replication or other pleading, and any record;

(d.) The expression ‘finding of the
indictment’ includes also the taking of an inquisition, the exhibiting an
information and the making of a presentment;

Revised Statutes of Canada 1927, c. 36:

2. …

…

(17) “indictment” and “count” respectively
include information and presentment as well as indictment, and also any plea,
replication or other pleading, any formal charge under section eight hundred
and seventy-three, and any record;

…

5. In this
Act, unless the context otherwise requires,

(a) finding the indictment includes
also exhibiting an information and making a presentment;

(b) having in one’s possession
includes not only having in one’s own personal possession, but also knowingly,

(i) having in the actual possession or
custody of any other person, and

(ii) having in any place, whether belonging
to or occupied by one’s self or not, for the use or benefit of one’s self or of
any other person.

2. If there are two or more persons, and
any one or more of them, with the knowledge and consent of the rest, has or
have anything in his or their custody or possession it shall be deemed and
taken to be in the custody and possession of each and all of them.

[Page 152]

The definition of “indictment” in 1927 no longer
included inquisitions nor did “finding an indictment” include “the taking of an
inquisition”. An inquisition was a reference to a Coroner’s inquest and, as no
one could as of the time of codification any longer be tried upon a Coroner’s
inquisition, reference to an inquisition was omitted from the Code of
1892. That is the only essential difference between the texts of 1886 and those
of 1927, save the addition in 1927 of the words “any formal charge under
section eight hundred and seventy-three” to the definition of indictment, which
was a reference to the charge before the petit jury in the provinces where
there was no grand jury (at the time, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta).

As for the word “information”, in 1886 it had
three possible meanings. It could mean that which was before a justice for
offences punishable by summary conviction, that upon which a preliminary
inquiry was held, or a criminal information. A criminal information was a
device whereby the grand jury was avoided and was a presentment by the
Sovereign or of a citizen and the Sovereign of an accusation to the petit jury.
This procedure was limited mainly to misdemeanours and though rarely if ever
employed in this country (See R. v. Wilson (1878), 43 U.C.Q.B. 583) was
officially abolished in 1953. As for “exhibiting an information” (an expression
that at first sight might suggest something prior to the decision of issuing a
process) its primary and most usual meaning was in regard to such “criminal
informations”. “Exhibiting” meant in civil law the commencement of a suit and
in criminal law the exhibiting of an information meant the commencement of a
trial for a misdemeanour before a petit jury by way of a “criminal
information”. It had nothing to do with Justices of the Peace at a preliminary
inquiry. (See Stroud, Judicial Dictionary, vol. 3, 4th ed., London,
Sweet & Maxwell Ltd., 1973, at p. 1362. See also Blackstone, Commentaries
on The Laws of England, vol. IV, 18th ed., 1829, where commenting on
criminal informations he says, at p.

[Page 153]

308: “The informations that are exhibited in the
name of the king alone, are… .”)

Exhibiting informations also had in the last
century a secondary meaning. Jowitt, The Dictionary of English Law, London,
Sweet & Maxwell Ltd., 1959, at p. 968, refers to the matters as follows:

Proceedings before justices of the peace in
matters of a criminal nature are commenced by an information, which is a
statement of the facts of the case made by informant or prosecutor, sometimes
verbally, sometimes in writing, and either with or without an oath; when not
upon oath, the information is said to be exhibited.

(Emphasis added.)

In my view, this latter meaning could not have
been the one intended in s. 5 of the Code of 1927 defining “Finding of
the indictment” as including “the exhibiting of an information”. Indeed, there
is no reason to preclude informations that are sworn and consider only those
that were not as amounting to indictments “found”. That would not make any
sense. In fact, were it not for the 1953-54 amendments to the Criminal Code  it
could be seriously questioned whether the word “information” in the Code definition
of indictment even before 1953 meant anything other than a “criminal
information”. In any event, even assuming that information did include those
before justices, reference to these old sections derived as they are from
ancient practice would still leave us facing the original question of if and when
an information may be found. The fact that Parliament, when abolishing criminal
informations in 1953, deleted the words “exhibiting an information” but left
the word “information” in the definition of indictment, clearly indicates that
information, whatever the word may have included in the predecessor sections,
as of then referred to those

[Page 154]

informations before Justices and those only, as
there existed as of then none else.

For these reasons I do not, with respect, think
that anything turns upon the predecessor sections. However, reference to the
historical evolution of the powers enjoyed by the Attorney General in the
charging process to which I shall allude shortly is of prime importance.

Now to consider the views of the Court of
Appeal.

With respect, I do not find compelling the first
and third reasons upon which they predicated their conclusion. As regards the
first of those reasons, all that s. 508(2) says is that you need not start all
over to recommence the proceedings. It does not follow that laying a new
information would amount to the “finding of an information”. If the Attorney
General does choose to start all over, he will of necessity have to lay an
information. Prior to the addition in 1972 of s. 508(2) to what is now s.
508(1) , there was uncertainty as to whether you had to prefer a new charge or
whether you could start the proceedings again by carrying on at the point the
proceedings were stayed. (See R. v. Mitchel (1848), 3 Cox C.C. 93; see
also R. v. Rosser (1971), 16 C.R.N.S. 321, at p. 326, for a
review of the authorities.)

The Court of Appeal’s third reason was expressed
as follows:

Since the decision of the Justice of the
Peace to proceed with the charges involves the issue of process in the name of
the Sovereign, it would seem appropriate that the Attorney-General as the chief
law officer of the Crown should have the power to prevent the use of such
process where he considers that the proceedings should be stayed. This involves
an executive decision which historically, and now by statute, has been vested
in the Attorney-General. This decision is not reviewable by the Courts and is
one for which he is in turn accountable to the Legislature or to Parliament, as
the case may be.

[Page 155]

The right of a private citizen to lay an
information, and the right and duty of the Attorney‑General to supervise
criminal prosecutions are both fundamental parts of our criminal justice
system.

There is nothing there said with which I take
issue. However, with respect, I fail to see why the conclusion dictated by
these remarks would of necessity be that the law should be interpreted as did
the Court of Appeal. Indeed, prior to that determination by the Justices of the
Peace, there being no summons or warrant issued, one could say that the process
is not yet put into operation. Furthermore, when the Attorney General in the
exercise of his supervisory power over criminal prosecutions chooses to prevent
the use of the criminal process, as is his right, his accountability to the
Legislature would be much greater if he acted after the Justice of the Peace
has determined that there is cause to issue process.

The power to stay is a necessary one but one
which encroaches upon the citizen’s fundamental and historical right to inform
under oath a Justice of the Peace of the commission of a crime. Parliament has
seen fit to impose upon the justice an obligation to “hear and consider” the
allegation and make a determination. In the absence of a clear and unambiguous
text taking away the right, it should be protected. This is particularly true
when considering a text of law that is open to an interpretation that favours
the exercise of that right whilst amply accommodating the policy consideration
that supports the power to stay. When one adds to these considerations the fact
that, apart from the court’s control, the only one left is that of the
legislative branch of government, given a choice, any interpretation of the
law, which would have the added advantage of better ensuring the Attorney
General’s accountability by enhancing the legislative capacity to superintend
the exercise of his power, should be preferred.

An historical review of the evolution of the
Crown’s power to avoid the preliminary inquiry or the grand jury indicates an
intent on the part of Parliament to increase the Attorney General’s
accountability. The most recent manifestation of

[Page 156]

this evolution is found in the amendments
brought to the Crown’s power to by-pass a preliminary inquiry and to prefer
indictments directly before a grand or petit jury. Prior to 1969, not only the
Attorney General but his agent, and the Deputy Attorney General, and any one
with the written consent of the Attorney General could prefer an indictment
directly.

The 1969 amendments first took out of the list
of those who could indict, even following a preliminary inquiry, the Deputy
Attorney General because he was not considered as being an agent of the
Attorney General. As for by-passing a preliminary inquiry or a discharge, his
agents or others, even with his written consent, can no longer do so. The
Attorney General himself or a person authorized by the court are the only ones
that can now prefer directly. I can see no reason why we should not when
possible interpret the law in compliance with this clear attitudinal trend on
the part of Parliament. Furthermore, to say that an information is found only
once a determination to issue a process is made is not inconsistent with the
procedure by indictment. We are here unfortunately dealing with legal
expressions which were developed in the grand jury system and as a result a
certain degree of transposition is required. Under the grand jury system (which
still exists in Nova Scotia) a
bill was preferred before the grand jury. If it found a true bill it presented
the indictment to the court. Prior to a true bill the Attorney General could
not under the common law stay the proceedings by entering a nolle prosequi. The
power to stay and limitation thereto were codified in this country in 1892 by
s. 732:

732. The
Attorney General may, at any time after an indictment has been found against
any person for any offence and before judgment is given thereon, direct the
officer of the court to make on the record an entry that the proceedings are
stayed by his direction, and on such entry being made all such proceedings
shall be stayed accordingly.

[Page 157]

2. The Attorney-General may delegate such
power in any particular court to any counsel nominated by him.

The procedure by indictment where there is no
grand jury in fact does away, though we still speak of preferring an
indictment, with the two stages of preferral and presentment. “There is but one
act, that act being the placing by the appropriate authority of ‘an indictment
in writing setting forth the offence’ before the trial court. This act
constitutes the commencement of the trial and is a combination of the steps of
preferral and presentment.” (Dickson J. for the Court in R. v. Chabot,
[1980] 2 S.C.R. 85, at p. 992.)

Under this procedure the Attorney General makes
the determination in the stead of the grand jury, and the next step is for the
court to issue the process to bring the accused before the court to answer the
charge. When the proceedings are commenced by an information the informant in a
sense “prefers” the information and the Justice of the Peace decides whether or
not to “find” the information and then the next step is to issue the process to
bring the accused before him. The Justice of the Peace then plays the same role
as the grand jury, as regards the finding of grounds to issue a process and
that of the trial court to issue a process following a preferment or
presentment.

The Attorney General’s power to stay starts as
of the moment a summons or warrant is issued.

Though this approach is not without logic, I
must admit that were it the only reason for adopting this course I should have
to adopt the second reason advanced by the Court of Appeal and dismiss this
appeal. Indeed the second observation made by the Court of Appeal cannot be
discarded easily, and accordingly I have felt great hesitation in concluding
that this appeal should be allowed. In fact, it is when addressing the third
observation made by the Court of Appeal, (the Attorney General’s historical
control of the process), that I have preferred a policy consideration,
desirable accountability, to the advantage of avoiding differ-

[Page 158]

ent approaches, one for indictable offences and
the other for summary conviction offences. The disparity between stays for
summary convictions and those for indictable offences is undesirable and could
not have been intended by Parliament. Such an anomaly is not, unfortunately so
infrequent in the field of criminal procedure. Our lexicon is archaic and no
longer corresponds to current institutions. Our changing sections are
unfortunately often the result of patchwork on the part of draughtsmen.
Furthermore, it is difficult for the courts to inject some logic and cohesion
in a system where, as regards the charging process, the exception has become
over the years the rule, where the exceptional procedures of direct indictment
without a grand jury for the Northwest Territories is now, save in Nova Scotia, the system for the whole country. When faced with the choice
between uniformity of procedure and greater political accountability for the
exercise of a necessary but no less dangerous discretion to circumvent the
courts and deny a citizen his right to bring another to court, I think I
should, pending Parliament’s decision to speak out in modern terms, prefer the
latter and suffer some anomaly in the law which I imagine is temporary.

For these reasons I would allow the appeal, and
order that a mandamus issue and be directed to his Worship Justice of the Peace
Allen to proceed with a hearing pursuant to s. 455.3  of the Criminal Code  on

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Corruption—Fraud upon the
government—Conspiracy—Elements of offence—Form of the indictment—Agreement to
receive benefit as consideration for cooperation, assistance and exercise of
influence not proven—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C‑34,
s. 110(1)(a), (d).

In 1965, respondents Giguère, Belhumeur,
Dionne and another person bought the shares of Publicor Inc. which held all the
outstanding shares of Canadian Advertising Agency Ltd. Although the advertising
agency’s financial position was poor at the time, it improved considerably
shortly after the takeover. A major part of this improvement resulted from
contracts with the federal government. The Agency made use of Giguère’s
political contacts in the federal government. Giguère also continued to arrange
meetings between government officials and the Agency’s representatives after
the sale of his shares to his partners in 1967. Respondents were later indicted
on three counts of conspiracy to offer or accept a “benefit as consideration
for cooperation, assistance and the exercise of influence” on the government;
the indictments are related to the awarding of advertising contracts to the
Agency. Respondents were acquitted at trial and the Crown’s appeal was
dismissed.

Held (Wilson
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Dickson
and Chouinard JJ.: The trial judge erred in assuming that there was in
law no “benefit” unless Giguère had been given more than fair market value for
his shares. The entire purchase price constituted a benefit within the meaning
of s. 110(1)(a) and (d) of the

[Page 449]

Code. To be
illegal however the benefit must be in consideration for cooperation,
assistance or exercise of influence. It is in this context that the matter of
fair market value becomes relevant. If a person is given fair market value or
more for his shares, it is pertinent to investigate to determine what is being
paid for. If the payment is for a past or future intervention by a person of
the nature proscribed by s. 110, an illegal benefit has been conferred. Here,
the worth of the Agency’s shares increased because of contracts with the government.
If those contracts could be attributed to Giguère’s influence, the payment for
Giguère’s shares could amount to payment for that influence. The trial judge
did not make the necessary findings and inferences of fact to make such a
determination because he wrongly thought fair market value to be the only
issue.

The trial judge also erred in his treatment
of fair market value. In determining whether Giguère’s shares were purchased at
fair market value, it was the sum effectively received by Giguère, and not the
cost to the donor, that the trial judge had to take into account.

The trial judge was also wrong in concluding
that Giguère’s opening doors or arranging meetings did not constitute
cooperation or assistance under s. 110. Opening doors or arranging meetings
does not by itself constitute “exercise of influence”. However, if someone
opens doors and arranges meetings as a first step in an effort by another to
secure a government contract, that is indeed assistance or cooperation in
connection with the transaction of business with government within s. 110(1) (a)
and (d).

Finally, although the indictment read for
“cooperation, assistance and exercise of influence”, the Crown did not
need to prove all three elements. An accused is liable for conviction on any
part of the indictment that constitutes an offence. Therefore, a conviction
should follow if the Crown proved a conspiracy to pay Giguère a benefit in
consideration for cooperation or assistance but not for the exercise of
influence. In the case at bar, the trial judge found no proof of any agreement
that Giguère cooperated, assisted or exercised influence. Such an agreement was
an essential ingredient of the offences as charged. Consequently, despite the
trial judge’s errors of law concerning the constituent elements of an offence
under s. 110(1)  of the Criminal Code , the respondents were
entitled to have their acquittals

[Page 450]

affirmed as the trial judge made sufficient
findings of fact to support the verdict.

Per Mclntyre
and Lamer JJ.: The Court of Appeal committed no error of law in dismissing the
appeal by choosing not to interfere with the trial judge’s findings that there
was no discussion nor agreement as to “future services” and to consider the
word “services” used by him as encompassing any activity contemplated under s.
110(1)(a) of the Code.

Per Wilson J.,
dissenting: The trial judge misdirected himself as to the constituent
elements of the offence under s. 110 of the Code. In particular, he
failed to appreciate that an agreement to open doors and arrange meetings in
return for a “benefit” could constitute cooperation or assistance within the
meaning of the section. Because of this error he made no finding of fact as to
whether there has been such an agreement and accordingly a new trial should be
ordered.

The judgment of Dickson and Chouinard JJ. was
delivered by

DICKSON J.—What are the elements of an offence
under s. 110  of the Criminal Code , proscribing frauds upon the
government? That general question lies at the heart of this case. The more
particular question is whether, despite any errors of law, the trial judge’s
findings of fact are such as to entitle the several accused to an acquittal.

I The Facts

The accused were tried without a jury before
Labrosse J. and were acquitted on three counts of conspiracy. The Crown’s
appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal (Lacourciere, Houlden, Goodman JJ. A.)
was unanimously dismissed. The Crown appeals to this Court by leave.

The three counts on the indictment are as
follows:

1. Louis de Gonzague Giguere, David
Belhumeur, Jean P. Dionne, Canadian Advertising Agency Limited and Publicor
Ltd. stand charged that between the first (1st) day of January, nineteen
sixty-five (1965) and the thirty-first (31st) day of December, nineteen
seventy-three (1973), at the City of Ottawa in the Judicial District of Ottawa‑Carleton
in the Province of Ontario and elsewhere in Canada, they unlawfully did
conspire together and with Leon Simard and with another person or other persons
unknown to have the said Louis de Gonzague Giguere, a person having or
pretending to have influence with the Government of Canada or with an official
of the Government of Canada, accept for himself a benefit, to wit, eighty-seven

sixty-five (1965) and the thirty-first (31st) day of December, nineteen
seventy-three (1973), at the City of Ottawa in the Judicial District of Ottawa‑Carleton

Government of Canada on behalf of the said Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation, contrary to Sections 423(1) (d) and 110(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  of Canada.

At trial, the Crown conceded that counts 2 and 3
are simply variants of count one, and that this Court’s decision in Kienapple
v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 29 precluded conviction on more than one
count.

[Page 453]

The disposition of this case depends largely on
what precisely were the trial judge’s findings of fact. I will consider that
aspect later in these reasons. At this stage, I will undertake only a brief
review of the uncontested facts.

Louis de Gonzague Giguère, during the period set
out in the first count, (January 1, 1965 to December 31, 1973), was chief organizer
of the federal Liberal party in the Province of Quebec. Throughout this period, the
Liberal party was in power at the federal level. From 1963 until September
1968, Giguère was a director of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Since
September 1968 Giguère has been a Senator. At the material times David
Belhumeur was a chartered accountant and a businessman. Jean Dionne was also a
businessman, involved primarily in the food sector. Canadian Advertising Agency
Limited (“Canadian Advertising”) was an old French Canadian advertising agency
that did work for the federal Liberals during elections. Publicor Ltd. held all
of the outstanding shares of Canadian Advertising.

In 1965 Canadian Advertising was in poor
financial condition. The majority shareholder of Publicor, Arthur Fontaine, was
terminally ill. He wanted to sell. His primary concern was to have Canadian
Advertising continue as a French Canadian company. He was prepared to sell his
interest in Publicor for $1, if the new purchasers would take over
responsibility for a $100,000 bank overdraft. The minority shareholders of
Publicor were also prepared to sell; their selling price was $22,500.

In September 1965 the sale of Publicor, and
hence Canadian Advertising, was completed. The purchasers were the three
individual accused, Giguère, Belhumeur and Dionne, as well as one Léon Simard.
Simard is an unindicted co-conspirator and one of the Crown’s chief witnesses.
The four new owners each paid $5,625 for the purchase of the minority
shareholdings and each acquired 25 per cent of the shares of Publicor. The

[Page 454]

$100,000 bank overdraft was guaranteed by
Simard, Belhumeur and Dionne, but not by Giguère. No one was ever called upon
to pay on the guarantee. A “cash flow” of $48,000 was put into Canadian
Advertising by way of a loan. Simard loaned $12,000; the remaining $36,000 was
loaned by a company called Air Food Caterers (AFC). From October 1965 onward
AFC was a company owned 42.5 per cent by Belhumeur, 37.5 per cent by Dionne,
and 20 per cent by Giguère.

Although Giguère was initially listed on the
records of Publicor as a shareholder, the records were changed shortly after
the September 1965 acquisition. Thereafter, Giguère’s shares were held by a
nominee, Paul Boudreau, an unnamed co-conspirator and Crown witness. Boudreau
had been a director and officer of Canadian Advertising; he was in charge of
the day-to-day operations of Canadian Advertising from shortly before the
takeover in 1965 until the spring of 1968, when he left Canadian Advertising.

After the takeover in 1965, the financial
position of Canadian Advertising improved considerably. A major part of this
improvement resulted from contracts with the federal government. Giguère had
contacts in the federal government of which the Canadian Advertising did make
use.

In late 1967 Giguère informed the other three
shareholders that he wished to sell his shares in Publicor. Giguère wanted
$100,000 for his quarter interest. Belhumeur, the accountant, did an
evaluation, without taking account of goodwill, and concluded Giguère’s shares
were worth approximately $52,000. Belhumeur, Dionne and Simard offered $67,000,
including $15,000 for goodwill. Giguère was not satisfied. It was finally
agreed that Giguère would get $67,000, plus $5,000 a year for five years—a
total of $92,000. The $5,000 a year was to be paid not by Belhumeur, Dionne and
Simard, but by Canadian Advertising as either salary or expenses. Canadian
Advertising would claim the salary or expenses as

[Page 455]

a deduction for income tax purposes, so the
effective cost would be $2,500 a year rather than $5,000. These would not be
legitimate company deductions, but, as the trial judge noted, the accused are
not charged with conspiring to evade taxes.

The $67,000 was actually paid to Giguère through
Canadian Advertising. Canadian Advertising was shortly thereafter reimbursed by
Simard and AFC. Belhumeur’s and Dionne’s two-thirds of the $67,000 was charged
back to them by AFC. In the same transactions the loans to Canadian Advertising
of $12,000 by Simard and $36,000 by AFC were retired.

The $5,000 a year was paid in different ways.
For about two years, Canadian Advertising paid a salary to Françoise Demers,
Giguère’s personal secretary. Demers was not an employee of Canadian
Advertising. It is conceded that a salary was paid to Demers rather than to
Giguère because Demers was in a lower tax bracket. Demers turned the money over
to Giguère. The practice of paying a salary to Demers stopped after an
inspection by the tax department. Thereafter, moneys were paid to Giguère by
way of expenses. Over the five years, the amount paid by Canadian Advertising
to Giguère, directly or indirectly, was approximately $25,000.

There is uncontradicted evidence that Giguère,
after the sale of his shares, arranged meetings between government officials
and representatives of Canadian Advertising, and also that Giguère put in a
good word for Canadian Advertising with at least one Cabinet Minister.

The factual question in this case is: what was
the nature of the agreement surrounding the sale of Giguère’s shares.

[Page 456]

II The Law

The charges are conspiracy to contravene s.
110(1)  of the Criminal Code . The first count relates to s. 110(1) (d),
the second and third to s. 110(1) (a):

110. (1)
Every one commits an offence who

(a) directly or indirectly

(i) gives, offers, or agrees to give or
offer to an official or to any member of his family, or to any one for the
benefit of an official, or

(ii) being an official, demands, accepts or
offers or agrees to accept from any person for himself or another person,

a loan, reward, advantage or benefit
of any kind as consideration for cooperation, assistance, exercise of
influence or an act or omission in connection with

(iii) the transaction of business with or
any matter of business relating to the government, or

(iv) a claim against Her Majesty or any
benefit that Her Majesty is authorized or is entitled to bestow,

whether or not, in fact, the official is
able to cooperate, render assistance, exercise influence or do or omit to do what
is proposed, as the case may be;

…

(d) having or pretending to
have influence with the government or with a minister of the government or an
official, demands, accepts or offers or agrees to accept for himself or another
person a reward, advantage or benefit of any kind as consideration
for cooperation, assistance, exercise of influence or an act or omission in
connection with

(i) anything mentioned in subparagraph
(a)(iii) or (iv), or

(ii) the appointment of any person,
including himself, to an office;

(Emphasis added.)

Section 110(1) (a) relates to public
officials, s. 110(1) (d) to persons having or pretending to have
influence with the government. In respect of count one (s. 110(1) (d) the
trial judge found, and it is not contested, that Giguère’s position as chief
organizer of the federal Liberal party in the Province of Quebec made him a
person having influ-

[Page 457]

ence with the government. In respect of counts
two and three Giguère’s position, respectively, of Senator and Director of
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, made him an official. (However,
Belhumeur and Dionne testified that they were not aware that Giguère was a
director of Central Mortgage and Housing until late 1967 when Giguère indicated
he wanted to sell his shares.) No questions of statutory interpretation arise
in relation to these elements of the offences. The matters in dispute are the
meanings in both s. 110(1) (a) and (d) of
(i) “benefit… as consideration for”, and of (ii) “cooperation, assistance,
exercise of influence”.

(i) “Benefit… as consideration for”

At trial, Labrosse J. assessed “benefit” within
s. 110(1) (a) and (d) exclusively in terms of
whether Giguère had been given fair market value for his shares. The Ontario
Court of Appeal seemed to agree. In my view, with respect, Labrosse J. erred in
this regard. I also think he erred in his treatment of fair market value.

Labrosse J. assumed that there was, in law, no
benefit unless Giguère had been given more than fair market value for his
shares. This Court’s decision in Doré v. Attorney General of Canada,
[1975] 1 S.C.R. 56, would suggest otherwise. Doré, a CBC employee, was paid a
salary by other companies for writing scripts. These companies then sold the
scripts to CBC upon Doré’s recommendation. One of the issues in the case was
whether the salary constituted a benefit under s. 110(1) (c), which
reads:

110. (1) …

(c) being an official or
employee of the government, demands, accepts or offers or agrees to accept from
a person who has dealings with the government a commission, reward, advantage
or benefit of any kind directly or indirectly, by himself or through a member
of his family or through any one for his benefit, unless he has the consent in
writing of the head of the branch of

[Page 458]

government that employs him or of which he
is an official, the proof of which lies upon him;

Doré took the position that the salary was not a
benefit because he was only being paid the fair market value of his labour. The
salary was held, however, to constitute a benefit. Pigeon J. said this, at p.
780:

Clearly, the fact that a sum of money or
other value represents only the equivalent of the benefits conferred does not
prevent it from being “a commission, reward, advantage or benefit”. The words
“commission” and “reward” suggest the idea of compensation for services
rendered.

I think the same reasoning applies to a purchase
of shares. The entire purchase price is a benefit. That does not, however,
necessarily connote an illegal benefit.

Section 110(1) (a)and (d) does
not make it illegal to receive a benefit as such; the benefit must be as
consideration for cooperation, assistance, and the like. It is in this
context that the matter of fair market value becomes relevant. As Pigeon J.
noted in Doré, supra, at p. 780, the question whether the sum
paid exceeds the value given may be important in deciding if it was given as
consideration for any of the matters mentioned in s. 110(1) . If a person is
given more than fair market value for his shares, it may lead to an inference
that something else is also being bought, and the something else may be within
s. 110 .

Even if only fair market value is given,
however, the inquiry is not ended. Fair market value tends to be within a range
than a fixed value. If the person is given an amount at the upper end of the
range, it is appropriate to ask why. If the reason is to obtain an intervention
in the future by the person of the nature proscribed by s. 110 , an illegal
benefit has been conferred.

It is also pertinent to look to the past to
determine what is being paid for when only fair market

[Page 459]

value is received. In the present case the worth
of the shares of Canadian Advertising, and hence Publicor, had been increased
between 1965 and 1967 because of contracts with the federal government. If obtaining
these contracts could be attributed to Giguère (and Labrosse J. made no finding
of fact on this point) payment for the shares could amount to payment for
Giguère’s intervention. Section 110 , of course, creates mens rea offences;
what matters is whether the accused Giguère was to be paid for past
interventions.

The matters referred to in the two preceding
paragraphs require findings and inferences of fact, none of which was made by
the trial judge, because he thought the only issue was fair market value.

I said earlier that I was also of the opinion
Labrosse J. erred in his treatment of fair market value. He concluded his
discussion on that topic with the following:

The seller started at one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000.00) and the buyers at fifty‑two thousand ($52,000.00).
Then taking into consideration the tax implications, they settled on
approximately seventy-nine thousand five hundred dollars ($79,500.00), of which
amount remaining shareholders were paying sixty-seven thousand dollars ($67,000.00)
as the balance would be paid as an expense of the agency.

In all the circumstances as they existed at
the time, I am satisfied that Giguère’s shares were not purchased at an
inflated price.

Labrosse J. decided that $79,500 was fair market
value, but that was not the selling price. I have great difficulty in agreeing
that illegal tax consequences can be taken into account in determining the
purchase price paid, but that is beside the point. The focus of s. 110  is the
government official or the person having or pretending to have influence. It is
that person’s integrity which is at issue and what matters is the amount that
person is supposed to receive. It is the value in the hands of the recipient,
not the cost to the donor, that counts. Giguère was supposed to receive
$92,000. The question in the present case is whether

[Page 460]

$92,000 was fair market value. The trial judge
made no finding of fact on this point.

I therefore conclude Labrosse J. made errors of
law in respect of “benefit… as consideration for” which caused him to fail to
make certain important findings of fact.

(ii) “Cooperation, assistance, exercise of
influence”

It is undisputed that “cooperation, assistance,
exercise of influence” are alternate modes of committing an offence under s.
110 . An act or an omission of the nature contemplated in s. 110  are, of
course, other modes but with these we are not here concerned. Proof of one mode
is sufficient to constitute an offence. However, the counts on the indictment
in the present case all read “cooperation, assistance and the exercise
of influence”. The Crown conceded at trial that the word “and” was conjunctive,
and it was being alleged the agreement was in respect of all three.

During the course of his reasons Labrosse J.
said this:

On the wording of the indictment, the words
cooperation, assistance and the exercise of influence must be taken
conjunctively. In my view, this is the strongest argument advanced by the
defence. There was no evidence from any of the numerous witnesses that Giguere
exercised influence in respect of the government contracts received by the
agency. I accept that exercise of influence would mean to affect a decision, or
do something that could affect the decision, but there was no evidence that any
decision to award a contract to the agency was affected by the intervention of
Giguere. The evidence was that he opened doors. There was evidence that he
arranged appointments to permit the representatives of the agency to make
presentations to government officials and in my view, this is not what is
contemplated by section 110 of the Code.

This passage contains three propositions of law:

[Page 461]

(1) opening doors or arranging meetings does not
constitute exercise of influence under s. 110 ;

(2) opening doors or arranging meetings does not
constitute cooperation or assistance under s. 110 ;

(3) the inclusion of “and” in the indictment
required the Crown to prove all three, “cooperation, assistance, exercise of
influence”, to obtain a conviction.

I think that Labrosse J. was right on the first
point, but in error on the latter two.

(a) Exercise of Influence

All parties in this case agree that “influence”
means to affect a decision. But what kind of decision? Respondents argue the
decision must be the actual decision to award a contract. The Crown argues that
a decision to hold a meeting is sufficient; opening doors and arranging
meetings is an exercise of influence under s. 110 .

It must be noted the word “influence”
appears twice ins. 110(1)(d):

110. (1) …

(d) having or pretending to
have influence with the government or with a minister of the government
or an official, demands, accepts or offers or agrees to accept for himself or
another person a reward, advantage or benefit of any kind as consideration for
cooperation, assistance, exercise of influence or an act or omission in
connection with

(i) anything mentioned in subparagraph (a)(iii)
or (iv), or

(ii) the appointment of any person,
including himself, to an office;

(Emphasis added.)

Prima facie, the
word means the same thing in both places. I will deal firstly with the initial
appearance of the word. A person “having or pretending to have influence”
clearly includes persons outside government—that distinguishes s. 110(1) (d)from
s. 110(1) (a). If arranging a meet-

[Page 462]

ing is influence, a non-government person who
could do no more than arrange a meeting would fall within the ambit of s.
110(1) (d). If, for example, a lawyer arranged a meeting with a
government official as part of the services for which he was paid, he would
commit an offence under s. 110(1) (d).That cannot be correct. The
threshold which must be passed before falling foul of s. 110(1) (d) must
be higher.

The general purpose of s. 110  is to preserve the
integrity of government. Those connected with government are meant to carry on
the business of government without favours being bought by those who deal with
government. The focus of s. 110  is those who have a real connection with
government. Section 110(1) (a) maintains this focus by being limited
to “officials”, i.e. those who are actually part of government.
Section 110(1) (d), although including people outside government,
must be limited to those who have, or pretend to have, a significant nexus with
government. Someone outside government who has no more “clout” than to be able
to arrange a meeting with a government official has at best a tangential
connection with government. That is not the type of person whose actions s. 110 
is trying to control. In my view, a person having influence with government is
a person who could affect, for example, a decision by government to award a
contract, and correspondingly a person who pretends to have influence is a
person who pretends he could affect such a government decision.

Having thus defined “influence” in the first line
of s. 110(1) (d), I think that “exercise of influence” in the rest
of s. 110 , i.e. in both s. 110(1) (a) and (d), must
be defined accordingly. There is nothing in the context that would suggest the
word “influence” changes its meaning in different parts of the same section. I
therefore agree with the respondents as to the meaning of the words “exercise
of influence”. In the present case it would mean actually affecting the
awarding of an advertising contract to Canadian Advertising.

[Page 463]

(b) Cooperation, Assistance

Labrosse J. thought that cooperation and
assistance within s. 110(1) (a) and (d) were something less
than the exercise of influence—otherwise he would not have attributed any
significance to the “and” in the indictment. He also assumed, however, that
cooperation and assistance were something more than opening doors and arranging
meetings. This is not only apparent from the passage quoted above, but also
from Labrosse J.’s treatment of similar fact evidence, all of which he ruled
inadmissible. The Crown sought to adduce evidence that Giguère had been
employed by Kruger Pulp & Paper Limited to open doors of the federal
government. The evidence was held not to constitute similar fact evidence
because it was not evidence of anything criminal.

Labrosse J. appears to have adopted the argument
made by counsel for Giguère at trial that the words “cooperation, assistance”
must be read in the context of “exercise of influence”, and thus signify a
higher level of intervention than the ordinary meaning of the words would
convey. That argument was not pressed in this Court.

In my view, if someone opens doors or arranges
meetings as the first step in an effort by another to secure a government
contract, that is indeed assistance or cooperation in connection with the
transaction of business with government within s. 110(1) (a) and (d).
That is simply giving the words their ordinary meaning.

Labrosse J. took a contrary view on the basis
that opening doors or arranging meetings is something perfectly legitimate,
happening frequently. The error in this approach is in examining particular
elements of s. 110  in isolation. By itself, opening doors or arranging meetings
is certainly not a crime. The problem arises only when two conditions meet: (i)
when a benefit is given, offered or demanded for the opening of doors or
arranging of meetings respecting the matters listed in s. 110(1) , and (ii) the
person who receives or demands it is an official or one having or pretending to
have influence in the sense defined earlier.

[Page 464]

In the previous section it was noted that,
as a threshold, s. 110(1)  applies only in respect of persons having a close
connection with government. Once that threshold is passed, however, the
section imposes stringent limitations. It is clear that the right to
contract with government is not something to be bought with under-the-table
payments. It is equally clear, in my view, that access to government officials
is not something to be bought. Even if it is a seemingly modest intervention,
opening doors or arranging meetings is caught by s. 110(1) (a) and (d)
as constituting cooperation or assistance.

(c) The Form of the Indictment

If there had been an agreement that Giguère be
given a benefit as consideration for opening doors and arranging meetings, an
offence would have been committed. But would that be an offence under this
indictment, which charged “cooperation, assistance and the exercise of
influence”?

It should be noted at the outset there is no
problem of duplicity here. Counsel for the respondents did not argue duplicity
in the conspiracy counts, nor was it suggested that the counts would have been
duplicitous if the substantive offence had been charged instead of conspiracy.
Cooperation, assistance, exercise of influence are alternate modes of
committing an offence under s. 110(1) (a) or (d).

The Crown’s primary position at trial was that
there was an agreement for Giguère to do all three, that Giguère was actually
to get contracts for Canadian Advertising Agency. Labrosse J. rejected the Crown’s
primary position on the facts. The Crown’s alternate position was that there
was at least an agreement for Giguère to cooperate and assist. Labrosse J.
assumed the form of the indictment precluded a conviction on this basis. I
think he was in error on this point.

[Page 465]

In R. v. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (Nos. 1 and
2) (1981), 33 O.R. (2d) 694 (C.A.), the indictment charged contravention of
the Combines Investigation Act in respect of sales of Librium and
Valium, but the trial judge found the evidence proved an offence only in
respect of Valium. In concluding that it was not necessary to amend the
indictment to enter a conviction, Martin J.A. drew an analogy to the cases of
theft or false pretences (p. 712). If an indictment charges theft of several items,
it is sufficient to prove theft of one to enter a conviction, and it is not
necessary to amend the indictment. The same applies to a charge of obtaining
money by false pretences or possession of stolen goods; Lake v. The Queen, [1969]
S.C.R. 9 (false pretences); R. v. Spot Supermarket Inc. (1979), 50
C.C.C. (2d) 239 (Que. C.A.) (theft); R. v. Kestenberg and McPherson (1959),
126 C.C.C. 387 (Ont. C.A.) (possession); this Court recently reaffirmed that
position in Lilly v. The Queen, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 94, although in
that case it was considered inappropriate to enter a conviction and a new trial
was ordered.

I agree with Martin J.A. that theft of lesser
amounts is no different in principle from committing an offence in one of the
two or more ways charged. A number of other Courts of Appeal adopted the view
that a conviction is warranted if the Crown proves at least one of the modes of
committing an offence charged: R. v. Graham (1954), 108 C.C.C. 153
(B.C.C.A.) (conspiracy to steal and receive and retain stolen
goods); R. v. Hundt (1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d) 279 (Alta. S.C., A.D.)
(while not being a member of the Alberta Guild… and not being a holder
of a certificate of competence… and not supplying in accordance with…);R.
v. MacNeil (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 46 (Ont. C.A.) (failed or refused to
comply with demand… to provide… samples of breath… and to accompany a
peace officer for the purposes…); R. v. Simard (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d)
306

[Page 466]

(N.S.S.C., A.D.) (failed
to stop and give his name and render assistance); R.v. Roberts
(1980), 18 C.R. (3d) 191 (Ont. C.A.) (robbery using knife and
revolver).

I conclude that if Labrosse J. had thought the
Crown had proved a conspiracy to pay a benefit to Giguère in consideration for
cooperation and assistance, but not for the exercise of influence, a conviction
should have followed for the part proved. This is simply one example of the
general principle that an accused is liable for conviction on any part of the
indictment that constitutes an offence.

III The Trial Judge’s Findings of Fact

I have concluded Labrosse J. made a number of
errors of law concerning the elements of an offence under s. 110 . Nevertheless,
the accused would be entitled to have their acquittals affirmed in this Court
if the trial judge had made sufficient findings of fact to support such a
verdict. Labrosse J. made a clear finding of fact that there was no agreement
that Giguère exercise influence. If he had also found no proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of any agreement to cooperate or assist, including opening
doors or arranging meetings, that would be sufficient to warrant an acquittal
despite the inadequate findings of fact concerning “benefit. as consideration
for”.

There is one finding in Labrosse J.’s judgment
which may, at first glance, seem to represent a holding of no proof of an
agreement to cooperate or assist: “I am not satisfied that anything Giguère
received was in consideration for something”. In the context, however, all
Labrosse J. seems to have been saying was that he found no benefit, about which
I have said he erred. The full passage from Labrosse J.’s judgment, part of
which was repro-

[Page 467]

duced earlier, is as follows:

I have already dealt with the argument of
the sale of Giguere’s shares at an inflated price in nineteen sixty-seven
(1967). I am not satisfied that he received any benefit other than what he was
entitled to for the value of his shares. That applies also to the benefit
referred to in Count two (2), which is part of the same money.

…

It follows from the above that I am not
satisfied that anything that Giguere received was in consideration for
something. But if I had found that a benefit had been accepted or given, it would have then been necessary that it be in consideration for
cooperation, assistance and the exercise of influence. On the working of
the indictment, the words cooperation, assistance and the exercise of influence
must be taken conjunctively. In my view, this is the strongest argument
advanced by the defence. There was no evidence from any of the numerous
witnesses that Giguère exercised influence in respect of the government
contracts received by the agency. I accept that exercise of influence would
mean to affect a decision or do something that would affect the decision, but
there was no evidence that any decision to award a contract to the agency was
affected by the intervention of Giguere. The evidence was that he opened doors.
There was evidence that he arranged appointments to permit the representatives
of the agency to make presentations to government officials and in my view,
this is not what is contemplated by section 110 of the Code.

(Emphasis added.)

The Ontario Court of Appeal treated this only as
a negation of consideration under s. 110 . I would not be prepared to conclude
on the basis of this passage alone that Labrosse J. found no proof of any
agreement that Giguère cooperate or assist.

At several places in his judgment Labrosse J.
said there was no agreement that Giguère provide “services”. He did not,
however, define what he meant by the word “services”. Nevertheless, the
ordinary meaning of the word is broad enough to include opening doors,
arranging meetings, or other forms of cooperation or assistance. There is
nothing in the judgment which would demonstrate conclusively that Labrosse J. was
using the word

[Page 468]

“services” to represent anything narrower than
its ordinary meaning. I therefore conclude that Labrosse J.’s findings of fact
were not only that the Crown had not proved an agreement that Giguère exercise
influence, but also that the Crown had not proved an agreement that Giguère
cooperate or assist, as defined earlier. Since proof of an agreement that
Giguère either exercise influence, or cooperate, or assist is an essential
ingredient of the offences charged, the accused are entitled to an acquittal
unless those findings of fact can somehow be challenged.

The Crown does attempt to challenge Labrosse
J.’s findings of fact on the basis that Labrosse J. misdirected himself on
issues of corroboration and circumstancial evidence. The alleged errors,
however, arise from what Labrosse J. did not say, not from what he did say. The
Crown asks us to infer error from the fact that the trial judge did not review
the law of corroboration or circumstancial evidence. I find nothing in Labrosse
J.’s judgment which would support the inference of misdirection in these
respects and I find no merit in the Crown’s argument. In my view Labrosse J.’s
findings of fact were ones open to him on the evidence, and ones which cannot
be interfered with on appeal.

In respect of Giguère only, the Crown alleged
that Labrosse J. had erred in failing to admit similar fact evidence. The
Ontario Court of Appeal agreed that Labrosse J. had erred on this point but
held, as the Crown had conceded, that this alone did not warrant a new trial.
The Crown again raised the similar fact point in this Court, but it is not
necessary to deal with it in light of the Crown’s concession before the Court
of Appeal.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 469]

The judgment of Mclntyre and Lamer JJ. was
delivered by

LAMER J.—The trial judge having accepted, as he
was entitled to do, the evidence of the respondents Dionne and Belhumeur that
there was no discussion nor agreement as to “future services”, and having
doubted the testimony of Crown witness Léon Simard on that point, the Court of
Appeal for Ontario committed no error of law in dismissing the appeal by
choosing not to interfere with the finding and to consider the word “services”
used by Labrosse J. as encompassing any activity contemplated under s. 110(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code .

The appeal to this Court from that decision
should therefore be dismissed.

The following are the reasons delivered by

WILSON J. (dissenting)—I am in respectful
agreement with the interpretation of s. 110  of the Criminal Code  contained
in the reasons for judgment of my colleague, Mr. Justice Dickson.

However, the problem before the Court as I see
it is that the learned trial judge, because he misdirected himself as to the
constituent elements of the offence under s. 110  in the ways indicated by my
colleague, failed to make the relevant findings of fact. In particular, having
failed to appreciate that an agreement to open doors and arrange meetings in
return for a “benefit” could constitute cooperation or assistance within the
meaning of the section, he made no express finding as to whether such an
agreement existed or not. Instead he focussed his attention on whether there
was an agreement that Giguère would provide “services” by which he clearly
meant something well beyond the opening of doors and arranging of meetings i.e.
something which would constitute the offence on his interpretation of the
section. He found that there was no such agreement. I do not see, however, how
a finding of no agreement to go beyond the opening of doors and arranging of
meetings can be construed as a finding of no agreement to open doors or arrange
meetings.

[Page 470]

Accordingly, I must respectfully differ from my
learned colleague as to the proper disposition of the appeal. I would allow it
and order a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Narcotics—Importation—Meaning
of “import”—Places of offence—Whether importing a narcotic a continuing
offence—Whether the act of importing a narcotic terminates upon the narcotic
crossing the border into Canada—Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1,
s. 5—Customs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-40, s. 101(a) [am. 1974-75-76
(Can.), c. 5, s. 3].

Criminal law—Trial—Directed verdict at close
of Crown’s case—Defence not yet concluded at that stage—Whether trial judge
erred in directing verdict of acquittal before evidence completed.

Appellant was charged with importing
narcotics contrary to s. 5 of the Narcotic Control Act. The drug,
hidden in footstools shipped from Jamaica to appellant’s home address in St‑Hubert, P.Q., was found at Toronto International Airport by customs officers who notified
the R.C.M.P. The footstools were then shipped to Mirabel Airport and taken by R.C.M.P. officers to their headquarters where
most of the drug was removed from the footstools. A few days later, they
returned them to Mirabel where they were picked up by the appellant. At trial,
at the close of the Crown’s case, appellant’s counsel made a motion for a
directed verdict of acquittal. The trial judge did not accept appellant’s argument
that the act of importation had been completed in Toronto on entry of the
marijuana into the country, but he nevertheless granted the motion on the basis
that the R.C.M.P.’s intervention broke the chain of possession of the goods and
completed the act of importation before the goods were received by the
appellant. On appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal
and ordered a new trial. The Court held that the offence of importing a
narcotic was a continuing offence which was not completed until the appellant
received the goods.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 472]

Per Beetz,
Estey, McIntyre and Chouinard JJ.: The trial judge erred in directing a verdict
of acquittal. While moving for a directed verdict, appellant’s counsel
announced that a defence would be presented. The evidence therefore had not
been completed at that stage of the trial and it was not for the trial judge to
weigh the evidence and to himself reach a conclusion as to the guilt or
innocence of the accused. It was incumbent upon him to consider the evidence
then before him and decide whether or not there was evidence upon which a
properly-instructed jury could convict the appellant of importing. He did not
address that question as he wrongly decided that the temporary seizure of the
imported narcotics by the R.C.M.P. precluded the finding of importation by the
appellant. The R.C.M.P.’s intervention in the circumstances of this case was
irrelevant. The offence of importing a narcotic is not of a continuing nature.
The ordinary meaning of the word “import” in s. 5 of the Narcotic
Control Act makes the offence of importing complete upon the entry of the
goods in the country.

Per Dickson
J.: On an offence of importing, there is no reason to restrict the relevant
location within Canada to the
actual point of border crossing. The word “import” should not be stultified by
narrow interpretation. The elements of the offence are present as soon as the
goods cross the border but the offence is not over and done with until the
goods have reached their intended final destination within Canada. Accordingly, a charge could be laid
relating to the point of entry or of destination or anywhere in between. Here,
it was open to the Crown to charge importing at Toronto, Mirabel or at St-Hubert. Consequently, the trial judge erred in
directing a verdict of acquittal as there was evidence to go to the jury. The
R.C.M.P.’s temporary and lawful diversion of the narcotics did not terminate
the ongoing act of importing and was irrelevant in the circumstances of this
case.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Quebec Court of
Appeal (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 317, setting aside appellant’s acquittal on a
charge of importing narcotics contrary to s. 5 of the Narcotic Control
Act. Appeal dismissed.

Richard Perras, for the appellant.

Gérald La Haye, for the respondent.

The following are the reasons delivered by

DICKSON J.—Section 5 of the Narcotic Control
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1, makes it a crime, punishable by imprisonment for
not less than seven years, to “import into Canada” any narcotic, except as
authorized by the Act or the regulations. The main question in this appeal is
whether the act of importing a narcotic terminates upon the narcotic crossing
the border into Canada or
whether the act of importing carries on until the narcotic reaches the intended
final destination within Canada.

I The Facts and Judicial History

Harris Bell was charged with importing a
narcotic, and two related charges. Only the importing charge is relevant to
this appeal. That count reads:

1. On or about April 18, 1979 at Mirabel,
District of Terrebonne, Harris BELL did unlawfully import into Canada a
narcotic to wit: 6.7 lbs. of Cannabis (marijuana), committing thereby an
indictable offence contrary to sections 5(1) and 5(2) of the Narcotic
Control Act. R.S.C. 1970.

The trial on the three counts was held, with a
jury, before Mr. Justice Bergeron of the Quebec Superior Court. At the end
of the Crown’s case defence counsel, while reserving his right to call
evidence, made a number of motions among which was a motion for a directed
verdict of acquittal on the importing charge.

For the purpose of dealing with the defence
motions, the trial judge gave the following summary of the Crown’s evidence:

On April 11 or 12, just a disparity of an
hour or two there, a shipment of four foot stools gift wrapped with birthday
paper originating from Jamaica and addressed

[Page 474]

to the accused’s name bearing a St-Hubert
P.Q. address first arrived in Toronto. A brief examination by customs disclosed
that the foot stools contained cannabis. The R.C.M.P. of a St-Jérôme
detatchment [sic], Québec near the point of arrival for
international flight of Mirabel, duly advised of the fact, obtained the goods
from customs, gave receipt and took them to their St-Jérôme headquarters. An
examination revealed the presence of six point seven pounds of marijuana in the
four stools.

Most of the substance was removed from
them, a small quantity being left in them before repacking the stools as well
as could be done and then taking them back on/or about April 18 to the customs
warehouse where instructions to advise …with instructions to advise the
R.C.M.P. as to anyone calling for their release. On the afternoon of
April 18, the accused presented himself to Air Canada’s counter to pay a
terminal fee of seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50) owed on the waybill
relating to the shipment and to a custom’s counter to sign an entry form and
obtain a release.

He later proceeded to the Air Cargo building
to take possession of the four stools by taxi and drove to his house at
St-Hubert P.Q. under the constant surveillance of the R.C.M.P. He then took the
stools inside and came out of the house to join two other people who had seen [sic]
in a car following him from the issue of the Mirabel boulevard where it
joins the Laurentian Autoroute. Two more people also arrived, a man in a
Cadillac and a young girl, all these people black. The police rounded up the
whole group and immediately proceeded into the house using a writ of assistance
and found the four stools unwrapped and piled on a single bed in the back room.

Their wrapping paper was found partly on
the kitchen table, partly in the waste basket or garbage container and partly
on the floor. On the table was also present what appeared to be the structure
of a dismantled foot stool, it’s covering material removed. Another similar
structure was found outside the house, in the back of it, off a small gallery
and near a garbage bag or can. A scraping of the stool structure between the
post and the walls showed the presence of zero point six grams of marijuana.
Much more was filed as evidence regarded the procedure used in exporting from
Jamaica, waybills, releases et cetera, and procedure at counters and so on.

[Page 475]

The evidence revealed that the four footstools
had been shipped from Jamaica to Toronto and then to Mirabel bearing Air Canada
waybill no. 014-42419624, addressed to Mr. & Mrs. Harris Bell,
5615 Perlini Street, St-Hubert, Montreal.

The accused argued before Bergeron J. that,
since the goods came into Canada at Toronto, the importation was terminated in
Toronto, so that there was no evidence to go to the jury of importing at
Mirabel as charged. The trial judge did not accept the argument, holding that
importing may extend beyond the time and place of entry into Canada. Bergeron
J. nonetheless granted the motion for a directed verdict on the basis that the
police possession of the marijuana interrupted the necessary continuity of
possession of the accused. Upon the granting of the directed verdict on the
importing charge, the Crown elected not to proceed on the two other charges.

The Crown appealed the acquittal on the
importing charge. The Quebec Court of Appeal, speaking through Mr. Justice
Montgomery, Bernier and Monet JJ.A concurring, allowed the appeal and ordered a
new trial. Montgomery J.A. concluded the police possession was irrelevant to
the charge of importing and that importing was a continuing offence which was
not completed until the accused took delivery of the goods consigned to him.

Harris Bell appeals to this Court as of right
under s. 618(2) (a) of the Criminal Code .

II When Is Importing Terminated?

The Narcotic Control Act contains no
definition of importing. The appellant argues, as he did before Bergeron J.,
that importing is terminated as soon as the goods cross the border into Canada.
In the present case it is contended that any importing was finished on April 11
or 12 in Toronto. In support of this submission, reliance is placed in

[Page 476]

part on s. 101(a) of the Customs
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-40 (am. 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 5, s. 3).

101. For the
purpose of the levying of any duty, or for any other purpose of this Act or any
other law relating to the customs,

(a) the importation of any
goods, if made by sea, coastwise or by inland navigation, in any vessel, shall
be deemed to have been completed from the time such goods were brought within
Canadian waters, and if made by land, then from the time such goods were
brought within the limits of Canada;

It is contended that this provision is
incorporated into the Narcotic Control Act by virtue of s. 14 of
the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23:

14. (1)
Definitions or rules of interpretation contained in an enactment apply to the
construction of the provisions of the enactment that contain those definitions
or rules of interpretation, as well as the other provisions of the enactment.

(2) Where an enactment contains an
interpretation section or provision, it shall be read and construed

(a) as being applicable only
if the contrary intention does not appear, and

(b) as being applicable to
all other enactments relating to the same subject-matter unless the contrary
intention appears.

(Emphasis added.)

In my view s. 101 (a) of the Customs Act  has
no application. It is concerned with the levying of duty, or for any other
purpose of the Customs Act  or any other law relating to customs. The Narcotic
Control Act is concerned with the health and welfare of mankind and the
serious social and economic evil of non-medical use of narcotics. The two Acts
are unrelated and the Interpretation Act does not provide a nexus. Even
if s. 101 (a) of the Customs Act  were considered to apply, it
would not, in my view, settle the point. Section 101 (a) would establish
an importing into Toronto, but it would not preclude a finding that there was
also importing into Mirabel, as charged. Section 101 (a) does not purport
to be an exhaustive definition. The true meaning of the phrase “import into
Canada”, as used in the Narcotic Control Act,

[Page 477]

cannot be found by recourse to the Customs
Act . It is manifestly necessary to look at the natural and ordinary meaning
of the phrase.

Bruce A. MacFarlane, the author of Drug
Offences in Canada (1979) observes, at p. 231 of his work, that Courts
have generally held there is no ambiguity or equivocation in the phrase “import
into Canada” as used in the Narcotic Control Act and that it should be
given its ordinary and natural meaning.

The ordinary meaning of the word “import”,
according to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, is “to bring in
(goods or merchandise) from a foreign country”. Le
Petit Robert, Dictionnaire alphabétique et
analogique de la langue française, 1976, defines thus the word importer:

Importer 1°
Introduire sur le territoire national (des produits en provenance de pays
étrangers). La France importe du café, du coton. 2° Importer
de la main-d’œuvre, un brevet de fabrication… Ant.
Exporter.

To import into Canada means to bring in goods
from anywhere outside Canada to anywhere inside Canada. I see no reason in
principle or precedent to restrict the relevant location within Canada to the
actual point of border crossing. The word “import” should not be stultified by
narrow interpretation. Importing is a process which, although it necessarily
includes the act of crossing the border, extends to the point of intended final
destination. In my view the test is whether there is a direct link between the
place of origin outside Canada and the destination inside Canada. Where goods
are mailed from Jamaica to St-Hubert, the nexus between Jamaica and St-Hubert
is obvious. If goods come from Jamaica via Toronto and Mirabel to St‑Hubert
they have come from Jamaica outside Canada to Mirabel inside Canada. They have
been imported to Mirabel. It is true that they have also come from Jamaica
outside Canada to Toronto inside Canada, and from Jamaica outside Canada to
St-Hubert inside Canada, so that there is also importing to Toronto and to
St-Hubert. This multiplicity does not, however, raise any

[Page 478]

problem for an accused because this Court’s
decision in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729 would ensure
against multiple convictions.

The above analysis is consistent with the
authorities. The appellant has not referred the Court to any decision in which
it was held that importing did not extend beyond the time and place of actual
border crossing. The cases which discuss this point all go the other way. It is
sufficient to refer to three of them.

In R. v. Hijazi (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d)
183 (Ont. C.A.) (leave to appeal to Supreme Court of Canada dismissed November
12, 1974, [1974] S.C.R. ix) the accused picked up some narcotics from customs.
It was argued by the accused that the actus reus was subsequent to
importing because his call at the customs warehouse was after the landing of
the goods in Canada. The Ontario Court of Appeal disagreed, saying at
p. 184:

In our opinion, the importation process is
not to be so narrowly construed. It extends to the point where delivery is
taken from the bonded warehouse by or on behalf of the person claiming the
goods.

With respect, I agree. Hijazi was found guilty
on the basis that he was at least an aider or abettor to the offence of
importing and therefore criminally liable under s. 21(1)  of the Criminal
Code . In my view this was a proper analysis. Section 21(1)  reads:

21. (1)
Every one is a party to an offence who

(a) actually commits it,

(b) does or omits to do
anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it, or

(c) abets any person in
committing it.

To “actually commit” importing, an accused must
bring in, or cause to be brought in, to Canada, goods from a foreign country;
this, by definition, necessitates crossing the Canadian border. Some-

[Page 479]

one who becomes involved only after the border
crossing, however, may be aiding and abetting a person bringing the goods from
outside Canada to a given destination inside Canada. In Hijazi the final
destination within Canada intended by the importer was clearly not the customs
warehouse. The importing was unfinished until after the narcotics had cleared
customs.

Re Whynott and The Queen (1974), 22 C.C.C. (2d) 433 (N.S.S.C.,T.D.), is not unlike the case
at bar. Hashish was concealed in a guitar case which went from Amsterdam
through Toronto to Halifax. The accused was charged with unlawfully importing a
narcotic at or near Enfield in the County of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The basis of
the application before the court was that there was no evidence that any
offence took place in the Province of Nova Scotia. The facts are given the
judgment of Chief Justice Cowan of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Trial
Division, at p. 440:

The evidence in the case before me
indicates that the applicant, Whynott, had arranged with the shipper, Thompson,
for the sending of the guitar and of the narcotic contained in it, from
Amsterdam to Kentville, Nova Scotia. The goods were destined for Kentville,
Nova Scotia, and the mere fact that the aircraft carrying them entered Canada
at some place unknown, or that it actually landed at Montreal or at Toronto, in
a Province other than Nova Scotia, is not conclusive on the question of the
place of importation. In accordance with the instructions of the sender of the
goods and the intention of the intended recipient, the goods were not held and
did not come to rest in the customs warehouse at Toronto. The goods were
transferred by KLM to Air Canada, and were brought to Nova Scotia. They then
rested briefly in the International Airport at Halifax, in the custody of Air
Canada, and were then taken to the sufferance warehouse at New Minas, near
Kentville, Nova Scotia. It is true that the actual transportation from Halifax
International Airport to the sufferance warehouse at New Minas was by police
officers, but the goods in question were still under the control of customs
officials who had delivered possession to the police for a

[Page 480]

certain restricted purpose.

The Chief Justice concluded:

In my opinion, there was evidence before
the committing Judge that an offence of importing into Canada a narcotic had
been committed and that this offence had been committed in the Province of Nova
Scotia.

He refused the motion in the nature of certiorari
to quash the committal. Whynott was later tried and convicted.

The Appeal Division of the Nova Scotia Supreme
Court ((1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 321) upheld the accused’s conviction for
importing into Enfield. The hashish was imported into Enfield since Enfield was
the home of the accused and the ultimate destination within Canada. Coffin
J.A., delivering the judgment of the Court quoted with approval from the
reasons of O’Meara J.S.P. in R. v. Geesman (1970), 13 C.R.N.S. 240, at
p. 254:

There may be other cases where, beneath the
scrutiny of other laws, a more technical or special sense may be given to the
word “import”; however, in the case at bar, the ordinary, grammatical and plain
meaning of the words far better comports with the object to be attained. The
unique object of the enactment in question, in respect of the evil against
which it is directed, is the suppression of illicit importation into and
exportation from Canada of narcotics.

In my considered opinion, to ascribe to the
words “import into Canada” that narrow and uniquely specialized meaning for
which defence counsel contended, would be utterly to emasculate the enactment,
to defeat its object, to promote the evil against which it is aimed and
thoroughly to misapprehend the intent of Parliament.

In R. v. Tanney (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d)
445 (Ont. C.A.) the accused became involved in a scheme after the hashish was
already in Canada, in bond in Toronto, pending arrangements to ship it to the
United States. Tanney was enlisted to accomplish this end. On appeal, an
acquittal was

[Page 481]

entered on the charge of importing. Evans J.A.,
speaking for the court, said this, at p. 450:

After reviewing the evidence, I am
satisfied that the Crown has not conclusively established with that degree of
certitude necessary in a criminal case that the involvement of the appellant
constituted acts in furtherance of a scheme to import the drugs into Canada.
The drugs were already in bond in Canada when the appellant became involved and
what he did was to order their transhipment to New York. While his conduct
might be culpable it does not constitute the offence charged against him.

In the circumstances of that case, the final
destination within Canada intended by the importer was the customs warehouse in
Toronto. The importing was finished before Tanney did anything and in my view
Tanney was properly acquitted.

The elements of an offence of importing are
present as soon as the goods cross the border, but the offence is not over and
done with until the goods have reached their intended final destination within
Canada. Accordingly, a charge could be laid relating to the point of entry or
of destination or anywhere in between. In this case there was evidence that the
intended and actual destination within Canada was St-Hubert, but there were
stops along the way at Toronto and Mirabel. In my view it was open to the Crown
to charge importing at Toronto or at Mirabel or at St-Hubert.

A number of judgments have referred to the crime
of importing narcotics as a “continuing offence”, defined in Black’s Law
Dictionary, 5th ed., as a “type of crime which is committed over a span of
time as, for example, a conspiracy” and as a “transaction or a series of acts
set on foot by a single impulse, and operated by an unintermittent force, no
matter how long a time it may occupy”. Words and Phrases (Permanent
Edition, vol. 9) defines a continuing offence as, inter alia, a “breach
of criminal law, not terminated by single act or fact, but subsisting for
definite period and intended to cover or apply to successive similar

[Page 482]

obligations or occurrences”. Whether the
importation of narcotics falls within the ambit of these definitions, or any of
them, may be open to debate. In my opinion, however, nothing turns on the
definitional niceties. So far as the outcome of this appeal is concerned, it is
of no consequence whether the importation of narcotics is or is not regarded as
a continuing offence.

III The Effect of Police Possession

As I have mentioned, the trial judge directed a
verdict of acquittal on the ground that continuity of possession had been
interrupted by removal by the police of the footstools to St‑Jérôme. I
agree with the Court of Appeal that the police possession was irrelevant. The
temporary and lawful diversion of the narcotics to the R.C.M.P. detachment at
St-Jérôme, for the purpose of testing, could not be said to have terminated the
ongoing act of importing. I agree with what was said by Cowan C.J.T.D. in Whynott
that the goods in question were “still under the control of customs
officials who had delivered possession to the police for a certain restricted
purpose”. I find no merit in the appellant’s argument on the interruption of
possession which found favour at trial.

IV Conclusion

I conclude there was evidence to go to the jury
that Harris Bell had imported marijuana into Mirabel on April 18, 1979 and that
the trial judge erred in directing a verdict of acquittal. The appeal should be
dismissed. I would confirm the order of the Court of Appeal of Quebec ordering
a new trial.

The judgment of Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and
Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—This appeal is taken against the
finding by the Quebec Court of Appeal that the acquittal of the accused upon a
charge of importing a narcotic into Canada should be set aside and that a new
trial should be ordered. The appellant

[Page 483]

was charged in an indictment, dated October 9,
1979, with three counts. The first count was in these terms:

1. On or about April 18, 1979 at Mirabel,
District of Terrebonne, Harris BELL did unlawfully import into Canada a
narcotic to wit: 6.7 lbs. of Cannabis (marijuana), committing thereby an
indictable offence contrary to sections 5(1) and 5(2) of the Narcotic
Control Act, R.S.C. 1970.

The second and third counts charged,
respectively, possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking at
Mirabel, and, simple possession at St-Hubert.

On April 9, 1979 four parcels, each containing a
footstool, were shipped by Air Canada from Jamaica to Canada. The parcels were
consigned to the appellant at his home address in St‑Hubert, Quebec. On
April 10 or 11, 1979 the parcels arrived at Toronto International Airport. Upon
inspection by customs officers it was found that some 6.7 lbs. of cannabis (marijuana)
were secreted in the footstools. The R.C.M.P. were notified and upon their
instructions the parcels were shipped on to their designated destination at
Mirabel Airport in Quebec. On April 12, 1979 the R.C.M.P. took the footstools
from Mirabel to their headquarters at St-Jérôme, Quebec. On April 17 they took
apart the footstools and removed most of the marijuana, leaving only five grams
in one of the footstools. They then reassembled and re-packaged the footstools.
On April 18, having been informed that inquiries had been made at Mirabel
regarding the parcels, the R.C.M.P. returned them to the airport. There the
appellant received the parcels, paid the freight charges, and took the parcels
to his home at St-Hubert, Quebec. He was followed by the R.C.M.P. and was
arrested there. A search of his house revealed a piece of paper near the
telephone on which was written a number which corresponded to the number of the
Air Canada way-bill covering the shipment to Canada and an address in Jamaica.
The way-bill, in addition to showing the address of the appellant as the
recipient and giving the address of a sender in Jamaica, described the
footstools as a gift.

[Page 484]

The appellant was tried before a judge of the
Superior Court of Quebec for the District of Terrebonne sitting with a jury. At
the close of the Crown’s case, counsel for the defence announced that a defence
would be presented but asked that the jury be excused. In the absence of the
jury, defence counsel made a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. This
motion was granted and the jury acquitted the appellant in response to the
judge’s direction. The trial judge in his reasons for the directed verdict
rejected the defence submission that the act of importation had been completed
in Toronto on entry of the marijuana into the country. He seems to have
accepted the view expressed in several cases, which will be referred to later,
that the offence of importing a narcotic is of a continuing nature and could
have extended in this case up to the receipt of the goods at Mirabel after they
had been released from Customs. He considered, however, that the act of the
R.C.M.P. in taking the marijuana out of Customs and returning the parcels after
removing most of the marijuana broke the chain of possession of the goods and
completed the act of importation before the goods were received by the
appellant. He said in his reasons:

The last opinion as to the interpretation
of the word “import” is one which this Tribunal shares. What troubles the Court
however is the juridical consequence of the intervention of the R.C.M.P. by
their removal from customs of the goods from bond, against simple receipt to
customs. By this intervention they deprive the customs who have the final say
on import goods in their eventual release to consignee of the element of
control necessary to establish the continuity of possession until they are
released to the accused, breaking the necessary link which is needed to tie
him, to the commission of the infraction of importing as per the definition
retained by this Court.

However necessary it may have been to
secure evidence or even to avoid the risk of the narcotics finding their way on
the streets, a main quantity could have been extracted from the stools without
the goods leaving the customs warehouse and the customs control. This was not
done, with the consequence that the importation was completed as to the time of
removal by the R.C.M.P. from the customs warehouse and by their own possession
of the goods after their entry into Canada.

[Page 485]

From the evidence adduced on this very
point it cannot be offered to the jury that there is evidence for the jury to
weigh as regards the first count of importing. A verdict shall therefore be
directed as to the first count.

The Crown elected not to proceed with the other
two counts.

The Crown’s appeal was allowed. Montgomery J.A.,
speaking for the court, adopted the view that importation is a continuing
offence and that in this case it would have extended up to the time the goods
were released from custody at Mirabel into the possession of the appellant. In
allowing the Crown’s appeal and ordering a new trial, he accepted as decisive
the reasoning in R. v. Hijazi (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 183 (Ont. C.A.) and
R. v. Whynott (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 321 (N.S.C.A.), in holding that the
offence of importing a narcotic is a continuing offence which is not completed
until the appellant receives the goods. He said:

The trial judge appears to have
distinguished the Hijazi and Whynott cases on the ground that the
R.C.M.P had removed the footstools containing the narcotics from the control of
the customs authorities, thereby completing the importation. With the utmost
respect, I cannot see the significance of this. In my opinion, the importation
was a continuing offence, which was not completed until respondent took
delivery of the goods consigned to him. What happened between their first
arrival in Canada and this delivery I regard as irrelevant, and I cannot agree
that the R.C.M.P. should have examined the footstools without removing them
from the customs warehouse.

The court considered the fact that for a time
the R.C.M.P. had removed the parcels from the custody of the customs
authorities to be irrelevant. This appeal is as of right, pursuant to
s. 618(2) (a) of the Criminal Code .

In this Court the appellant argued that the act
of importation was complete upon the entry of the parcels into Canada on April
10 or 11, 1979, dates which in my opinion fall within the words in the
indictment, “on or about April 18, 1979”. There was, therefore, no involvement
with the appellant

[Page 486]

at the place where the importation occurred or
on the date specified. It was also argued that the offence, if one was
committed, occurred in Toronto and not within the jurisdiction of the Quebec
Superior Court and, as no timely motion to amend the indictment had been made
by the Crown, that the appellant was entitled to an acquittal. The respondent
argued that the Court of Appeal had not found, nor did the evidence reveal,
that the whole offence was committed into Ontario and that any interruption in
possession occasioned by the intervention of the R.C.M.P. was irrelevant. In
this the respondent was supporting the idea that importation is a continuing
offence.

The characterization of importing a narcotic as
a continuing offence has appeared in several cases. In R. v. Whynott, supra,
hashish concealed in a guitar case entered Canada at Toronto on an aircraft
from Holland. It was then shipped to Nova Scotia where it was picked up by the
accused from Canadian customs officers and taken to his home. He was arrested
by the R.C.M.P. at his home with the narcotic in his possession after having
removed it from the guitar. He was convicted of importing and his appeal to the
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal was dismissed. The court had to decide whether or
not the courts of Nova Scotia had jurisdiction to try the offence in light of
s. 434(1)  of the Criminal Code , which reads in part:

…nothing in this Act authorizes a court in
a province to try an offence committed entirely in another province.

After a review of several cases, Coffin J.A.,
speaking for the court (Coffin, Cooper and Macdonald JJ.A.) held, at
p. 340, that the offence was a continuing offence that actually occurred
when the appellant took the material out of the guitar at his home in Nova
Scotia. It was said that when he did this he provided clear evidence that he had
knowledge of the contents and hence a mens rea. It will be observed that
effect was given to the description of the offence as a ‘continuing’ one by
determining that it occurred when the goods were removed from the guitar
several days after their entry into

[Page 487]

Canada. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal dealt
with this question again in R. v. Salvador (1981), 21 C.R. (3d) 1. In
that case a yacht entered port in Nova Scotia with a cargo of some eight tons
of marijuana. On a charge of importing, the accused argued that the ship had
been forced by bad weather to enter Canadian waters and seek refuge, its real
destination being the United States. The entry was therefore not voluntary and
therefore not criminal. The court rejected this defence and upheld the
conviction. In dealing with this defence, the court considered that the entry
of the yacht into Canada was voluntary and that the voluntary bringing into the
country of narcotics constituted the crime of importation. MacKeigan C.J.N.S.
held that the trial judge had correctly instructed the jury that importation
was the act of knowingly bringing a forbidden narcotic into the country and
quoted from the trial judge’s charge to the jury, at pp. 5-6: “As well, the
moving of it within Canada after having brought it in may be the continuing
offence of importing. You may import not only merely as you enter but if you
continue with it after your entry.” Macdonald J.A. reached the same conclusion.
He was of the view that the authorities supported the proposition that
importing is a continuing offence and he referred with approval to R. v.
Hijazi, supra, and the words of Schroeder J.A., where he said, at pp.
184-85, after holding that the acts of importation could extend to the point
where the goods were released from customs:

Taking a view of the evidence most highly
favourable to the accused it may be said that it was established on the
evidence that the goods were in Canada before any overt act or acts on his part
became evident; and his culpability must be founded upon his conduct in
securing the release and delivery of the goods from the bonded warehouse. In
our view, that conduct was sufficient to make him a participant in the
commission of the offence charged through the operation of the provisions of
s. 21(1)of the Code.

[Page 488]

Other cases concerning this question which were
considered in Salvador include R. v. Geesman (1970), 13 C.R.N.S.
240 (Que. S.P.); R. v. Martin (1973), 21 C.R.N.S. 149 (Ont. S.C.).

It can be seen that there is judicial support
for the Crown’s contention in the case at bar that the ‘continuing offence’
principle could be used to justify the conviction of the appellant. It
therefore becomes necessary to consider what a continuing offence is and
whether importing can be classed as one.

A continuing offence is not simply an offence
which takes or may take a long time to commit. It may be described as an
offence where the conjunction of the actus reus and the mens rea, which
makes the offence complete, does not, as well, terminate the offence. The
conjunction of the two essential elements for the commission of the offence
continues and the accused remains in what might be described as a state of
criminality while the offence continues. Murder is not a continuing offence.
When the requisite intent to kill is present the crime is complete when the
killing is effected. Conspiracy to commit murder could be a continuing offence.
The actus reus and mens rea are present when the unlawful
agreement is made and continue until the killing occurs or the conspiracy is
abandoned. Whatever the length of time involved, the conspirators remain in the
act of commission of a truly continuing offence. Theft is not a continuing
offence. It is terminated when the wrongful taking has occurred with the
requisite intention. On the other hand, possession of goods knowing them to
have been obtained by the commission of theft is a continuing offence. The
offence of kidnapping would not be a continuing offence, but that of wrongful
detention of the victim following the kidnapping would be.

It is apparent, in my view, that importing a
narcotic cannot be a continuing offence. I do not find it necessary to make
extensive reference to dictionaries in order to define the word “import”. In my
view, since the Narcotic Control Act does not give a special definition
of the word, its ordi-

[Page 489]

nary meaning should apply and that ordinary
meaning is simply to bring into the country or to cause to be brought into the
country. With the utmost respect for judges who have taken a different view, I
am of the opinion that the characterization of importing a narcotic as a
continuing offence is misconceived. The offence is complete when the goods
enter the country. Thereafter the possessor or owner may be guilty of other
offences, such as possession, possession for the purpose of trafficking, or
even trafficking itself, but the offence of importing has been completed and
the importer in keeping or disposing of the drug has embarked on a new criminal
venture.

In some of the cases which have been referred to
above, it has been said that to limit the act of importing to simple entry of
the goods into the country is to adopt too strict an approach. The concept of a
continuing offence, it seems to me, has been adopted in these cases to extend the
reach of s. 5 of the Narcotic Control Act, to encompass conduct
which cannot really be classed as importing. It has been considered that this
approach is justified in order to give full effect to the purpose of the Act
which in this respect is to control and suppress the social evils resulting
from the importation of narcotics into the country and the adoption of a narrow
construction of the word “import” would be to defeat that purpose. In my view,
the construction I have placed on the word is not a narrow one. It is merely
the normal or ordinary one, and one which has been adopted in some of the
earlier cases: see Pennell J. in R. v. Martin and O’Meara J.S.P. in Geesman.

I do not consider that there is merit in the
suggestion that the application of this view makes a conviction on an importing
charge a virtual impossibility and thereby frustrates the clearly expressed
intention of Parliament. To convict of importing, it is not necessary to show
that the accused actually carried the goods into the country. Neither is it
necessary to show that the accused was present at the point of entry. It is
quite possible for ‘A’ while at town ‘X’ to make all the arrangements and
perform all the acts required

[Page 490]

to import illicit goods at town ‘Y’. Indeed in
ordinary commerce, merchants in, say, Vancouver import goods through eastern
Canadian ports on a regular basis without ever visiting the port of entry. The
same principle can be applied in criminal cases and criminal acts performed in
one province can render the actor liable to prosecution in another province and
subject to the jurisdiction of that other province. In R. v. W. McKenzie
Securities Ltd., [1966] 4 C.C.C. 29, stock promoters in Ontario, who were
not licensed under The Securities Act of Manitoba, solicited by mail and
telephone the purchase of shares in Manitoba without ever being in Manitoba.
They were convicted in Manitoba of an infraction of the Manitoba Securities
Act. Their appeal to the Manitoba Court of Appeal was dismissed. Freedman
J.A. (as he then was), in giving judgment for the court, said at p. 37:

The issue as to whether the activities of
the accused constituted a violation of the Securities Act of Manitoba
falls to be decided solely on what occurred within this Province. That they
were registered to trade in securities in Ontario would only be relevant if
they were faced with a charge of violating the corresponding statute of that
Province. It is an irrelevant circumstance in the present prosecution. The sole
point to be determined is whether the accused Dubros and the accused West, both
of whom were unlicenced here, traded in securities in Manitoba. That they did
not physically enter the borders of the Province is not conclusive of the
matter. A person may, from outside the borders of a Province, do certain acts
within the Province so as to make himself liable to the provisions of this
statute. Williamson, Securities Regulation in Canada (University of
Toronto Press, 1960), at p. 204 says:

“There seems to be no reason why a person
cannot become subject to a licensing statute of a province without ever
entering the province, constitutional questions aside.”

Although offences are local, the nature of
some offences is such that they can properly be described as occurring in more
than one place. This is peculiarly the case where a transaction is carried on
by mail from one

[Page 491]

territorial jurisdiction to another, or
indeed by telephone from one such jurisdiction to another. This has been
recognized by the common law for centuries. Thus, where a threatening letter
was written and posted in London, and delivered in Middlesex, it was held by
the Court that the writer could properly be tried in Middlesex: R. v.
Girdwood (1776), 1 Leach 142, 168 E.R. 173 (C.A.). Vide also R.
v. Esser (1767), 2 East P.C. 1125.

To similar effect is Re Bennett and Schuette
v. The Queen (1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 61. In that case, involving charges
under s. 340  of the Criminal Code , the placing of an order with a
Vancouver broker which was passed on to a Calgary broker for entry in the
Calgary stock exchange (which entry constituted the offence) was held to be
sufficient to constitute the commission of the offence in British Columbia and
give jurisdiction to the British Columbia courts.

The principle expressed in McKenzie
Securities and Re Bennett and Schuette is peculiarly applicable to
the case at bar. The Narcotic Control Act forbids the importation of
narcotics into Canada. The offence of importation may be committed anywhere in
Canada and one offence may occur in whole or in part at more than one location
in Canada. As in the case of the honest merchant, the drug importer may from
one part of Canada make all the arrangements and do all the acts necessary to
bring about the importation of narcotics at another point. In so doing, it may
be said he has committed an offence which has occurred at two places, or
commenced in one jurisdiction and completed in another. Either the courts of
the jurisdiction where the goods entered the country or those of the province
where the acts or arrangement leading to the importation occurred will have
jurisdiction to deal with the case: see s. 432 (b) of the Criminal
Code . The intervention of the R.C.M.P. in the circumstances of the present
case is, I agree, irrelevant.

It will be recalled that at the close of the
Crown’s case the appellant, while moving for a directed verdict, announced that
a defence would be presented. The evidence therefore had not been completed at
that stage of the trial and it was not

[Page 492]

for the trial judge to weigh the evidence and to
himself reach a conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. It was
the task of the trial judge to consider the evidence then before him and to
decide whether there was evidence upon which a properly-instructed jury could
convict the appellant of importing marijuana as alleged in the indictment: see R.
v. Morabito, [1949] S.C.R. 172. Because of an error in law, that is, a
finding that the temporary seizure of the imported narcotics by the R.C.M.P.
precluded the finding of importation by the appellant, the trial judge did not
address that question. He was therefore in error in directing a verdict of
acquittal.

For the above reasons it is my opinion that the
appeal must fail and the order of the Court of Appeal for a new trial must be
affirmed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Crown immunity—Combines investigation—Crown
corporations charged with conspiracy to lessen competition—Whether corporations
entitled to Crown immunity—Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-23, s.
32(1)(c) [rep. & sub. 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 76, s. 14]—Interpretation Act,

1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 33, s. 265 (Item 4)], 3, 6.

The respondents were charged under s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines
Investigation Act of conspiring with others to unduly lessen competition in
the production or sale of uranium products in Canada. They applied to the
Supreme Court of Ontario for an order prohibiting the Provincial Court from
proceeding to inquire into the charges on the basis that the Provincial Court
lacked jurisdiction to proceed because they were agents of the Crown and
therefore the Combines Investigation Act did not apply. The Supreme
Court granted the applications and the Court of Appeal upheld the decision.
This appeal is to determine whether respondents are immune from criminal
liability under s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act
because they are agents of the Crown.

[Page 552]

Held (Mclntyre and Wilson JJ. dissenting in part): The
appeals should be dismissed.

Per Laskin C.J. and Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz and
Chouinard JJ.: The Combines Investigation Act is not binding on the
Crown. Section 16 of the Interpretation Act makes it clear that the
Crown is immune unless expressly bound. There is no section in the Combines
Investigation Act or the Interpretation Act which makes the Act
applicable to Her Majesty. The effect of Crown immunity is not that the Crown
is immune from prosecution even though there has been an unlawful act, rather,
there is no unlawful act under the statute because the statute does not apply
to the Crown. Crown immunity extends to agents and servants because the Crown
only acts through agents and servants. The respondents are each by statute “for
all its purposes an agent of Her Majesty”. A Crown agent is only entitled to
immunity when it acts within the scope of the public purposes it is statutorily
empowered to pursue. Prima facie, the conduct complained of was within
the scope of Crown purposes, for which the companies were incorporated—namely,
to implement national policy relating to atomic energy in all its aspects. No
evidence was presented or alluded indicating that the companies acted outside
corporate objects for other than Crown purposes. Accordingly, there is no merit
in the appellant’s submission that the prohibition orders were premature.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz and
Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The question is whether respondents, Uranium Canada
Limited (“Uranium Canada”) and Eldorado Nuclear Limited (“Eldorado”), are
immune from criminal liability under s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-23, because they are agents of the
Crown.

I The Proceedings to Date

By informations sworn July 4 and July 7, 1981 by Orest R. Sametz,
Combines Investigation Officer, the respondents and others were charged with
having conspired, combined, agreed or arranged together and with another to
prevent or lessen, unduly, competition in the production, manufacture,
purchase, sale or supply in Canada of uranium, uranium oxide and other uranium
substances, contrary to s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act.
A summons was issued to each of the respondent Companies. Each appeared before
Judge Rice of the Ontario Provincial Court (Criminal Division). Tentative dates
were set for a preliminary inquiry. Before the commencement of the inquiry,
each Company applied to the Supreme Court of Ontario for an order prohibiting
Judge Rice or any other judge from proceeding to inquire into the charges. It
was contended that the Provincial Court lacked jurisdiction to proceed because

[Page 554]

they were agents of the Crown and therefore the Combines
Investigation Act did not apply.

Although Uranium Canada and Eldorado were charged in separate
informations, the two prohibition applications were heard together, by
agreement. Notwithstanding certain differences in the legal origins of the two
Companies, the two cases raise similar issues, and it is convenient to deal
with both in a single judgment.

The prohibition applications were successful in the court of
first instance. Mr. Justice J. Holland found that under the express terms
of their governing statutes neither Company could act other than as an agent of
the Crown, and, since the Combines Investigation Act did not bind Her
Majesty, either expressly or by necessary implication, the conduct complained
of in the charges could not be characterized as criminal. There was accordingly
no foundation upon which the charges could be validly laid or prosecuted.

In an oral judgment the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the
prohibition orders. Cory J.A., Houlden and Thorson JJ.A. concurring, concluded:

(i) the Combines Investigation Act does not apply to the
Crown because of s. 16 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23;

(ii) by virtue of the statutes under which Uranium Canada and
Eldorado are constituted, each Company is an agent of Her Majesty for all its purposes,
and may act in no other capacity than as agent of the Crown;

(iii) the two Companies are authorized by their respective
corporate objects clauses and relevant legislation to perform the acts
complained of in the charges against them; and

[Page 555]

(iv) in carrying out such corporate purposes Uranium Canada and
Eldorado are entitled to the same immunity from prosecution as the sovereign.

The Court of Appeal took this further point. Both the preamble
and the specific provisions of the Atomic Energy Control Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. A-19, emphasize it is in the national interest to control and
supervise atomic energy. The specific provisions of the Act should therefore
prevail over the general provisions of the Combines Investigation Act.
It followed that the Combines Investigation Act does not apply to the
two Companies.

The appeal to this Court by the Attorney General of Canada is
based on the submission that the Combines Investigation Act is binding
on the Crown; in the alternative, that even if the Combines Investigation
Act does not bind the Crown, Uranium Canada and Eldorado cannot claim Crown
immunity for the following reasons:

(i) Nothing in the corporate objects of either Company, nor in
the statutory provisions governing the Companies’ corporate existence, nor in
the Atomic Energy Control Act itself, authorizes either Company to
conspire, combine or agree to lessen unduly competition in the production,
manufacture, purchase, sale or supply of uranium.

(ii) Although breaches of the Combines Investigation Act
are not authorized by either Company’s corporate objects, nevertheless both
Companies have the capacity, as opposed to the legal power, to commit criminal
acts for which they may be held responsible.

(iii) By statute each Company is “for all its purposes” an agent
of the Crown, but the words “its purposes” should be construed as meaning lawful
purposes, such that the Companies will be agents of Her Majesty only when
carrying out corporate purposes and exercising corporate powers in a lawful
manner.

(iv) Uranium Canada and Eldorado are entitled to Crown immunity
only when acting within

[Page 556]

their authority in furtherance of Crown purposes.

(v) There was no evidence before the Court of Appeal upon which
to base a finding that Uranium Canada and Eldorado had not exceeded their
respective corporative authorities. It is implicit in the fact that the
information charges an offence contrary to s. 32(1) of the Combines
Investigation Act that the Attorney General takes the position that the
accused were not authorized to do the acts constituting the offence. Whether
the accused exceeded authority is a factual matter to be determined from
evidence which the Attorney General will lead in proof of the charge. Hence the
prohibition orders were premature.

II Does the Combines Investigation Act bind the Crown?

The doctrine of Crown immunity from statutes is a very old common
law doctrine. In 1457 Ashton J. stated, Y.B. 35 H.6, f.62:

quant un remedy soit fait pur un statute ce
ne serra entendu en contre le roy s’il ne soit pas expressement reherse.

That wording may seem to be quite broad, but it has been
suggested by H. Street, in “The Effect of Statutes upon the Rights and
Liabilities of the Crown”, (1948) 7 U. of T.L.J. 357 at p. 361, that this had
application only to the King’s prerogative and was therefore relatively narrow.
It can at least be said that, a century later, the Court of Appeal in Willion
v. Berkley (1561), 1 Plowd. 223, 75 E.R. 339, recognized clear limits on
the extent of Crown immunity. The case concerned a statute involving the right
to alienate land. The majority of the Court decided the King was bound, though
there were no express words to that effect. Dyer C.J. said this at pp. 251-52:

And as to what is said, that the King shall not be bound by
the Act, and that there shall not be any restraint in the estate which he
takes, unless the same be precisely expressed in the Act, sir, in some cases I
admit that the King shall not be restrained by general words, without express
restraint in the Act, and that is according to the

[Page 557]

matter of the Act; but in this Act he shall be bound, for it
is made for the furtherance of restitution, that is to say, where it was a
great abuse that the donee had the power of aliening after issue had, (which being
a common error was taken for the common law) this statute was made to reform
the abuse, and to restore the common law in this point to its right and just
course, which it did by restoring to the donor the observance of his intent. So
that the design of the Act is to give restitution, and in restitutions the King
has no favour, nor has his prerogative any exemption, but the party restored is
favoured. [Footnotes omitted]

Brown J. said, at p. 248 “it is a difficult argument to prove
that a statute, which restrains men generally from doing wrong, leaves the King
at liberty to do wrong”. Street describes the law of that time in the following
way, at p. 362:

By 1561 it had been established that the crown was bound by
a statute which was intended to bind it, and it is clear that where the statute
affected the subject’s rights rather than the crown’s, the courts would readily
read into the statute an intention to bind the crown. On the contrary, there
was a strong presumption that a general statute would not affect the king’s
prerogative rights unless he were named in it.

Street’s thesis is that the modern common law position is based
on a misunderstanding of the precedents. Whether or not this is true, and
Street does make a persuasive case, it is clear that the current common law
position embraces a broad notion of Crown immunity. In Province of Bombay v.
City of Bombay, [1947] A.C. 58, the Privy Council held that the Crown was
only bound by statute if expressly named therein, unless the Crown were bound
by necessary implication. The latter concept was explained, at p. 63, in the
following terms:

If it can be affirmed that, at the time when the statute was
passed and received the royal sanction, it was apparent from its terms that its
beneficent purpose must be wholly frustrated unless the Crown were bound, then
it may be inferred that the Crown has agreed to be bound.

The Bombay test makes no differentiation between types of
statutes involved, or types of rights or obligations imposed. This Court relied
on the

[Page 558]

Bombay test in Her Majesty in Right of the Province of Alberta
v. Canadian Transport Commission, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 61. I note in passing
that the Attorney General is not submitting in this appeal, as he apparently
did in the courts below, that the Crown is bound by the necessary implication
doctrine.

Parliament has followed the lead of the common law, and taken the
development one step further. Section 16 of the Interpretation Act removes
even the necessary implication exception:

No enactment is binding on Her Majesty or affects Her
Majesty or Her Majesty’s rights or prerogatives in any manner, except only as
therein mentioned or referred to.

The conceptual rationale underlying the doctrine of Crown
immunity is obscure. In Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. The King, [1916]
1 A.C. 566, the Privy Council said, at p. 586:

…it is the general rule in the construction of statutes that
the Crown is not affected unless there be words to that effect, inasmuch as the
law made by the Crown with the assent of the Lords and Commons is enacted prima
facie for the subject and not for the Sovereign.

Why that presumption should be made is not clear. It seems to
conflict with basic notions of equality before the law. The more active
government becomes in activities that had once been considered the preserve of
private persons, the less easy it is to understand why the Crown need be, or
ought to be, in a position different from the subject. This Court is not,
however, entitled to question the basic concept of Crown immunity, for
Parliament has unequivocally adopted the premise that the Crown is prima
facie immune. The Court must give effect to the statutory direction that
the Crown is not bound unless it is “mentioned or referred to” in the
enactment.

The Combines Investigation Act contains no
section purporting to make the Act applicable to Her Majesty. Prima
facie then, because of s. 16 of the Interpretation Act, the
Combines Investigation

[Page 559]

Act is not binding on the Crown. The Attorney General,
however, makes two arguments directed to showing that the Combines
Investigation Act does apply to the Crown.

The first argument turns on the fact that s. 32 of the Combines
Investigation Act, on which the charges in this case are based, was at one
time s. 411  of the Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51. In 1960
Parliament enacted An Act to amend the Combines Investigation Act and the
Criminal Code, 1960 (Can.), c. 45, which repealed s. 411 of the Code
and re-enacted the provision as s. 32 of the Combines Investigation Act.
Section 22 of the 1960 amending legislation also contained the following
provision:

Except to the extent that subsection (1) of
section 32 of the Combines Investigation Act as enacted by this Act
is not in substance the same as section 411  of the Criminal Code  as
in force immediately before the coming into force of this Act, the said
subsection (1) of section 32 of the Combines Investigation Act
shall not be held to operate as new law, but shall be construed and have effect
as a consolidation and as declaratory of the law as contained in the said
section 411  of the Criminal Code .

The Attorney General makes the point that both s. 411 of the
1953-54 Criminal Code  and s. 32 of the Combines Investigation Act
used the words “every one”, which were defined in s. 2(15) of the 1953-54 Criminal
Code  (as it still is today) in the following terms:

‘every one’, ‘person’, ‘owner’, and similar expressions
include Her Majesty and public bodies, bodies corporate, societies, companies
and inhabitants of counties, parishes, municipalities or other districts in
relation to the acts and things that they are capable of doing and owning
respectively;

Relying on the above-quoted provision in the 1960 amending
legislation, the Attorney General submits that the words “every one” in s. 32
of the

[Page 560]

Combines Investigation Act now have the meaning it had
when the section was part of the Criminal Code , and s. 32 of the Combines
Investigation Act therefore applies to the Crown.

The flaw in the Attorney General’s first argument is that the
definitions in s. 2  of the Criminal Code  begin with the words “In this
Act”. In other words, in the absence of a provision expressly incorporating the
Criminal Code  definition of “every one” into the Combines
Investigation Act, the definition applies only in the Code itself.
In my opinion the provision in the 1960 amending statute to the effect that s.
32 of the Combines Investigation Act should not “operate as new law” is
not sufficient to overcome express words in the Criminal Code  that
restrict the definition of “every one” to that Act. Section 16 of the Interpretation
Act requires an express provision to make an act binding on the Crown. The
giving of royal assent amounts to a waiver of immunity. In the Court’s decision
in Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. Attorney-General for Ontario,
[1959] S.C.R. 188 (the 1959 CBC case), both the majority and dissent
agreed that clear language was needed to bind the Crown. The “shall not be held
to operate as new law” stipulation in the 1960 amending Act is far too vague
and oblique a reference to have the effect for which the Attorney General
contends.

The Attorney General’s second argument is to the effect that the Criminal
Code  definition of “every one” is inferentially imported into the Combines
Investigation Act by s. 27(2) of the Interpretation Act which reads:

All the provisions of the Criminal Code  relating to
indictable offences apply to indictable offences created by an enactment, and
all the provisions of the Criminal Code  relating to summary conviction
offences apply to all other offences created by an enactment, except to the
extent that the enactment otherwise provides.

[Page 561]

The Attorney General submits that the definition of “every one”
in s. 2 of the Code is a provision “relating to indictable offences” and
as such it applies to offences created by the Combines Investigation Act.

With respect, I disagree. The gist of this argument is that s.
27(2) of the Interpretation Act incorporates the Criminal Code 
definition of “every one” into all federal penal enactments, thereby making all
such enactments binding on the Crown, “except to the extent that the enactment
otherwise provides”. This cannot be right because it is directly contrary to
the express words of s. 16 of the Interpretation Act, which provides
that “No enactment is binding on Her Majesty… except only as therein mentioned
or referred to”. Section 16 makes the Crown immune unless expressly bound,
and it cannot be that s. 27 of the same Act binds the Crown unless expressly
exempted. In my view s. 27(2) of the Interpretation Act does not import
the Criminal Code  definition of “every one” into the Combines
Investigation Act, and it does not make the latter Act binding on the
Crown.

Even if the Attorney General could succeed in showing that the Criminal
Code  definition of “every one” is incorporated into the Combines
Investigation Act, he woud still face the obstacle posed by the decision in
the 1959 CBC case, supra, where the majority held that the Criminal
Code  definition of the word “person”, which is identical to the definition
of “every one”, did not make the Lord’s Day Act binding on the Crown,
even though that Act expressly incorporated the Criminal Code 
definition. The majority view was that the provision that “person” included Her
Majesty was not sufficiently clear to make the Crown criminally liable; it was
read as stipulating that Her Majesty could be a victim of crime. The Interpretation
Act, however, has been amended since this judgment was rendered. In 1959
the exception recognized by the section was: “unless it is expressly
stated therein that Her Majesty is bound thereby”. The new exception clause
reads: “except only as therein mentioned or referred to”.

[Page 562]

It is not necessary to determine whether the 1959 CBC case
was rightly decided or whether the result in the case would be the same under
the new version of s. 16; for present purposes it is enough to observe that
there is some doubt whether the definition of “every one” in the Criminal
Code  has the effect of making the Code, and any enactment
incorporating that definition, binding on the Crown.

For the above reasons, then, the submission of the Attorney
General that the Combines Investigation Act binds the Crown must fail.
The question that remains is whether Uranium Canada and Eldorado are entitled
to the benefit of the Crown’s immunity from the prohibitory terms of the Combines
Investigation Act.

III Are Eldorado Nuclear and Uranium Canada
entitled to Crown Immunity?

In Canada, the head of state is Her Majesty the Queen, the
reigning monarch of the United Kingdom. By providing that “no enactment is
binding on Her Majesty… except only as therein mentioned or referred to”,
Parliament has put the state, commonly referred to as the Crown, beyond the
reach of Acts of Parliament that are not expressly made applicable to the
Crown.

Like a corporation, the Crown must act through agents or
servants. Assuming for the moment that Uranium Canada and Eldorado were acting
as agents of the Crown, where do they stand vis-à-vis the Combines
Investigation Act? The Attorney General submits that even if the Crown is
immune, agents of the Crown may be personally liable for breaches of the civil
or criminal law. It is argued that the principles applicable to civil and
criminal responsibility are the same. The conclusion reached is that a Crown
agent may be criminally responsible under the Combines Investigation Act.

The Attorney General relies on this Court’s decision in Conseil
des Ports Nationaux v. Langelier, [1969] S.C.R. 60. This was a delict case.

[Page 563]

During the course of his reasons Martland J., speaking for the
Court, said this, at p. 70:

What is in issue here is the responsibility of a person,
whether individual or corporate, who, though a Crown agent, and purporting to
act as such, commits an act which is unlawful. My understanding of the law is
that a personal liability will result. The liability arises, not because he is
an agent of the Crown, but because, though he is an agent of the Crown, the
plea of Crown authority will not avail in such event.

This passage properly states the law, but I do not agree it
produces the result for which the Attorney General contends.

At common law, the Sovereign could not be brought into the
Queen’s courts in the ordinary way. This arose from an immunity of the
Sovereign from court process. This immunity was distinct from the immunity of
the Sovereign under statutes. Immunity from court process did not, however,
leave the subject without any civil remedy. For certain matters, such as breach
of contract, the procedure of petition of right was available to settle
disputes between the Crown and a subject. In tort the Queen could not be sued
but that did not prevent an agent of the Queen from being sued. In Feather
v. The Queen (1865), 122 E.R. 1191 (C.A.), one of the authorities relied
upon by Martland J., Cockburn C.J. speaking for the Court, said this, at pp.
1205-06:

For the maxim that the King can do no wrong applies to
personal as well as to political wrongs; and not only to wrongs done personally
by the Sovereign, if such a thing can be supposed to be possible, but to
injuries done by a subject by the authority of the Sovereign. For, from the
maxim that the King cannot do wrong it follows, as a necessary consequence,
that the King cannot authorize wrong. For to authorize a wrong to be done is to
do a wrong; inasmuch as the wrongful act, when done, becomes, in law, the act
of him who directed or authorized it to be done. It follows that a petition of
right which complains of a tortious act done by the Crown, or by a public
servant by the authority of the Crown, discloses no matter of complaint which
can entitle the petitioner to redress. As in the eye of the law no such wrong
can be done, so, in law, no right to redress can arise; and the petition therefore,
which rests on such a

[Page 564]

foundation falls at once to the ground. Let it not, however,
be supposed that a subject sustaining a legal wrong at the hands of a minister
of the Crown is without a remedy. As the Sovereign cannot authorize wrong to be
done, the authority of the Crown would afford no defence to an action brought
for an illegal act committed by an officer of the Crown… But in our opinion no
authority is needed to establish that a servant of the Crown is responsible in
law for a tortious act done to a fellow subject, though done by the authority
of the Crown—a position which appears to us to rest on principles which are too
well settled to admit of question, and which are alike essential to uphold the
dignity of the Crown on the one hand, and the rights and liberties of the
subject on the other.

The maxim that the Queen can do no wrong is a legal fiction
which, at common law, serves the purpose of preventing the Queen from being
impleaded in her own courts. There is, however, no comparable maxim that an
agent of the Queen can do no wrong.

The conclusion that a Crown agent is personally responsible for
an unlawful act still leaves the question whether the act is unlawful. Where
the unlawfulness or the wrongfulness of the act arises without any recourse to
a statute, the Crown’s immunity from statute, as expressed in s. 16 of the Interpretation
Act, is irrelevant. If, for example, the agent commits a tortious act, it
is the common law which characterizes it as unlawful. There is no immunity that
the agent can claim.

Where the only source of the unlawfulness is a statute, however,
the analysis is entirely different. Reference to a statute is necessary for
criminal responsibility in Canada, apart from contempt of court, because s. 8 
of the Criminal Code  precludes any conviction for an offence at common
law. If a person commits an act prohibited by statute, and the Attorney General
seeks to prosecute for violation of that statute, the preliminary question that
must be asked is whether that person is bound by the statute. If not, the
person simply does not commit a violation of the statute. The situation is not
that the person is immune from prosecution even though there has been an
unlawful act;

[Page 565]

rather, that there has been no unlawful act under the
statute. I have already said that the Combines Investigation Act does
not bind the Crown. If Uranium Canada and Eldorado share the Crown’s immunity,
they can have committed no offence under the Act.

Both the majority and the dissent in the 1959 CBC case, supra,
accepted that proposition of law that s. 16 of the Interpretation Act
extends to agents of the Crown. This Court’s decision in Formea Chemicals
Ltd. v. Polymer Corporation Ltd., [1968] S.C.R. 754 also makes it clear
that a reference to the Crown in a statute extends to Crown agents. If this
were not the interpretation given to s. 16, the section would have no
meaning, since the Crown only acts through servants and agents. Crown agents
benefit from Crown immunity because they are acting on behalf of the Crown. The
critical question, then, is whether Uranium Canada and Eldorado were acting as
agents.

Uranium Canada and Eldorado are each, by statute, expressly made
“an agent of Her Majesty”. Uranium Canada owes its status as a Crown agent to
s. 10(4) of the Atomic Energy Control Act, which reads:

A company is for all its purposes an agent of Her Majesty
and its powers may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty.

Eldorado’s agency status derives from the Government Companies
Operation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. G-7; section 3 reads:

Every Company is for all its purposes an agent of Her
Majesty and its powers may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty.

The fact that these statutory provisions make each of the
respondent Corporations “for all its purposes” an agent of the Crown does not
mean, however, that these Companies act as Crown agents in everything they do.

Statutory bodies such as Uranium Canada and Eldorado are created
for limited purposes. When a Crown agent acts within the scope of the public

[Page 566]

purposes it is statutorily empowered to pursue, it is entitled to
Crown immunity from the operation of statutes, because it is acting on behalf
of the Crown. When the agent steps outside the ambit of Crown purposes,
however, it acts personally, and not on behalf of the state, and cannot claim
to be immune as an agent of the Crown. This follows from the fact that s. 16 of
the Interpretation Act works for the benefit of the state, not for the
benefit of the agent personally. Only the Crown, through its agents, and for
its purposes, is immune from the Combines Investigation Act.

This Court recently adopted this approach in Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation v. The Queen, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 339 (the 1983 CBC
case), where the CBC sought immunity in relation to charges of showing an
obscene film contrary to s. 159(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . The
CBC is established under the Broadcasting Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. B-l 1;
section 40(1) of that Act provides as follows:

Except as provided in subsection 38(3), the Corporation
is, for all purposes of this Act, an agent of Her Majesty, and its power under
this Act may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty.

This Court upheld the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal
that the CBC could be prosecuted under the Criminal Code ,
notwithstanding it was an agent of the Crown. In the Court of Appeal and here,
the key to this result was a Regulation promulgated under the Broadcasting
Act  which prohibited the broadcast of any “obscene, indecent or profane…
presentation”. The CBC was charged with breach of the Criminal Code , not
with breach of the Broadcasting Regulations, but the Regulation was important
because the Broadcasting Act  made the Corporation a Crown agent “for all
purposes of this Act”, and the Regulation demonstrated that in broadcasting an
obscene film the Corporation was not acting for purposes entrusted to it under
the Act. This Court expressly adopted the following passage from the judgment
of the Ontario Court of Appeal (at p. 353):

[Page 567]

In my view, when the Corporation exercises its powers with a
view to carrying out the purposes of the Broadcasting Act , it acts as
agent of Her Majesty and only as agent of Her Majesty. But, when it exercises
its powers in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of the Act, it steps
outside its agency role. That role subsists only so long as the Corporation’s
broadcasts are implementing the policy laid down in the Act. This seems to me
to be the effect of s. 40(1) .

When the present proceedings were before the Ontario Court of
Appeal this Court had not rendered judgment in the 1983 CBC case. The
Court of Appeal distinguished its own decision in that case on the basis that
the Broadcasting Act  makes the CBC a Crown agent “for all purposes of
this Act” while the Atomic Energy Control Act and the Government
Companies Operation Act make each of the respondents in this appeal an agent of
the Crown “for all its purposes”. The Court of Appeal thought the latter words
were broader than the words of the Broadcasting Act , and under the
statutory provisions at issue here “there are no limits on the status of the
agency”.

With respect, I disagree. The Broadcasting Act  uses the
words “purposes of this Act” in the agency clause because the CBC is
established by the Broadcasting Act  and derives its corporate objects
and powers from that Act (ss. 34(1), 39). Uranium Canada and Eldorado, on the
other hand, are not created by the Atomic Energy Control Act or the Government
Companies Operation Act, but are incorporated under the Canada
Corporations Act  and receive their corporate objects and powers from that
statute and from their letters patent. Under these circumstances, it would be
inappropriate for the Atomic Energy Control Act or the Government
Companies Operation Act to refer to the “purposes of this Act” in the
agency clauses. For this reason I cannot accept that the difference in wording
has the significance the Ontario Court of Appeal attributed to it. In my
opinion, any limitations that might be imposed on the CBC’s agency status by
the words “purposes of this Act” are also imposed on the agency of

[Page 568]

Uranium Canada and Eldorado by the words “its purposes”. That
being so, the 1983 CBC case makes the same point as the present one: a
Crown agent is entitled to the benefit of the immunity afforded by s. 16 of the
Interpretation Act only when it acts within the scope of the Crown
purposes it is authorized to serve.

I think it is also important to draw a distinction between (i)
acts committed in the course of fulfilling Crown purposes but in no way
undertaken in order to effect Crown purposes; and (ii) those acts committed
which are designed to effect Crown purposes. Whereas the latter situation does
invoke Crown immunity, the former does not. I refer, by way of illustration, to
R. v. Stradiotto, [1973] 2 O.R. 375 (C.A.). In that case a member of the
militia was charged with careless driving under the Ontario Highway
Traffic Act. At the time, Stradiotto was driving a Department of National
Defence vehicle while in his official militia duties. The Ontario Court of
Appeal rejected the claim of Crown immunity on the basis that Stradiotto could
have effected Crown purposes without violating The Highway Traffic Act.
I agree with the result reached in Stradiotto, but not with the reasoning
of the Ontario Court of Appeal. In my view, the reason Crown immunity could not
be invoked was that the careless driving was wholly incidental to official
militia purposes. The careless driving was in no manner in the furtherance of
the Crown purposes of the militia. In driving carelessly, Stradiotto stepped
outside Crown purposes and no longer was acting as agent. Accordingly, he could
not claim immunity.

Against this background, can it be said that the acts alleged in
the indictments here in question fall within the purposes of Uranium Canada and

[Page 569]

Eldorado? I will deal firstly with Uranium Canada.

Section 10(1) of the Atomic Energy Control Act
provides that the Minister responsible for the Act may:

(b) with the approval of the Governor in Council,
utilize, cause to be utilized and prepare for the utilization of atomic energy;

(c) with the approval of the Governor in Council,
acquire, or cause to be acquired by purchase, lease, requisition or
expropriation, prescribed substances and any mines, deposits or claims of
prescribed substances and patent rights relating to atomic energy and any works
or property for production or preparation for production of, or for research or
investigation with respect to, atomic energy;

Section 10(2)(a) of the Act gives the Minister
authority to procure the incorporation of companies under Part I of the Canada
Corporations Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-32 , for the purpose of exercising and
performing on behalf of the Minister such of the powers conferred upon him by
s. 10(1) of the Atomic Energy Control Act as the Minister may from time
to time direct.

Part I of the Canada Corporations Act , referred to in s.
10(2)(a) of the Atomic Energy Control Act, deals with the
formation of new companies, and makes provision for matters typically dealt
with in business corporation statutes, such as the powers and duties of
companies, transfer of shares, alteration or reduction of share capital, calls,
borrowing powers, and so on.

On June 21, 1971 Uranium Canada was incorporated under Part I of
the Canada Corporations Act  by the Minister of Energy, Mines and
Resources pursuant to his powers under s. 10(2) of the Atomic Energy Control
Act. The Company’s letters patent set out its objects as follows:

(a) to exercise and perform on behalf of the Minister of
Energy, Mines & Resources the powers, respon-

[Page 570]

sibilities, duties and obligations that may be imposed upon
the Company pursuant to contracts to be entered into with the approval of the
Governor in Council pursuant to the authority of Vote L-11 c of the
Appropriation Act No. 1, 1971;

(b) to exercise and perform such other powers conferred on
the Minister by subsection 1 of section 10 of the Atomic Energy
Control Act, 1946, as amended by S.C. 1954, chapter 47, as the Minister may from
time to time direct.

By supplementary letters patent issued June 10, 1975, Uranium Canada’s objects were amended by adding thereto paragraph (c) which reads:

to negotiate, execute and perform agreements for the
purchase, stockpiling and sale of uranium concentrates and to do or procure the
doing of anything necessary or incidental thereto, all subject to the approval
of the Governor in Council.

Vote L-11c referred to in paragraph (a) of the Company’s objects
is as follows:

Acquisition in fiscal years 1970-71, 1971-72, 1972-73,
1973-74 and 1974-75 of uranium concentrates in accordance with contracts to be
entered into, with the approval of the Governor in Council, with Denison Mines
Limited including authority to sell the uranium concentrates acquired under the
said contracts and to appoint a sales agent for such purpose.

During the period covered by the charges in this case all the
shares of Uranium Canada, except qualifying shares of the directors, were held
by the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources in trust for Her Majesty in
right of Canada. All of the Company’s directors and officers were senior
officials in various departments and branches of government, including External
Affairs; Energy, Mines and Resources; Finance; Industry, Trade and Commerce;
Justice; the Privy Council Office; and the Natural Sciences and Engineering
Research Council. Uranium Canada conducts its affairs in, and has no place of
business separate from, the offices of the Department of Energy, Mines and
Resources. It has no employees of its

[Page 571]

own. Its total assets are $9 received in payment for directors’
qualifying shares.

In broad terms, Uranium Canada’s corporate functions are to buy
and sell uranium and related products with the approval of the Governor in
Council, and to exercise such other powers with respect to the acquisition,
production and utilization of uranium as the Minister may direct. Uranium Canada
is “for all its purposes” an agent of the Crown. The question that arises is
whether entering into a conspiracy or arrangement to reduce competition in the
production, sale or supply of uranium is within Uranium Canada’s corporate
objects and “purposes”. On this point the Court of Appeal said:

It can be seen that the respondents are charged with doing
acts which by their objects they are authorized to perform. Assuming, as we
must, for the purposes of the appeal that the respondent companies performed
the acts attributed to them in the indictment then the performance of those
acts prima facie fell within the powers conferred on them by their
objects clauses and their authorizing legislation.

I have no doubt marketing arrangements relating to uranium come
within the powers conferred by paragraph (c) of Uranium Canada’s letters
patent. They cannot be said to be incidental to the Company’s powers. Such
powers, however, are to be exercised “subject to the approval of the Governor
in Council”. Mr. Justice J. Holland concluded on the basis of the relevant
legislation and the affidavits filed on the application that Uranium Canada is
a Crown agent incorporated for the single purpose of carrying out the policy of
the government of Canada relating to atomic energy, and that in so doing it
operated under the directing mind of the Minister of Energy, Mines and
Resources, and with the approval of the Governor in Council. Nothing in the
records indicates otherwise. Whether Uranium Canada acted with or without
government approval is important because the Atomic Energy Control Act
provides that Uranium Canada is a Crown agent “for all its purposes”, not that
it is a Crown agent in whatever it does. If Uranium Canada performed the acts
complained of in the information with the approval

[Page 572]

of the Governor in Council, it acted within “its purposes” and is
entitled to immunity as a Crown agent. If, on the other hand, it acted without
such approval, it acted outside “its purposes”, and beyond the scope of its
agency, and cannot claim to be immune on the basis that it entered the alleged
combine on behalf of the Crown.

I turn now to the other respondent. Eldorado Mining and Refining
(1944) Limited was incorporated by Letters Patent on June 30, 1945, under Part
I of The Companies Act, 1934. In 1952 the Company’s name was
changed to Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited, and in 1968 changed again to
Eldorado Nuclear Limited—Eldorado Nucléaire Limitée. By 1964-65 (Can.), c. 52,
s. 2, the short title of the Companies Act was changed to the Canada
Corporations Act ; thereafter Eldorado was incorporated under Part I of the Canada
Corporations Act . Eldorado’s corporate objects and purposes read in part:

To acquire, own, lease, prospect for, open, explore,
develop, work, improve, maintain and manage mines and mineral lands and
deposits, and to dig for, raise, crush, wash, smelt, assay, analyze, reduce,
amalgamate, refine, pipe, convey and otherwise treat ores, metals and minerals,
whether belonging to the company or not, and to render the same merchantable
and to sell or otherwise dispose of the same or any part thereof or interest
therein;

In 1968, by supplementary letters patent, the following was added
to the above description of the Company’s objects:

and to purchase, lease, mine, refine, process and sell
uranium, zirconium or any other material or equipment relative to the nuclear
industry;

All of Eldorado’s issued shares are owned by, or held in trust
for, Her Majesty in right of Canada. Hence Eldorado comes within the definition
of “company” in the Government Companies Operation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
G-7 (as amended by 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 33, s. 265 (Item 4)), which
reads:

[Page 573]

“Company” means a company incorporated under Part I of the Canada
Corporations Act , or a corporation incorporated under the Canada
Business Corporations Act , all the issued shares of which are owned by or
held in trust for Her Majesty in right of Canada except, in the case of a
company incorporated under Part I of the Canada Corporations Act , shares
necessary to qualify other persons as directors;

Section 6 of the same Act provides:

This Act applies to a Company only from the date of the
issue of a proclamation by the Governor in Council declaring this Act to be
applicable to such Company.

On or about August 1, 1946, the Governor in Council issued a
proclamation directing that the Government Companies Operation Act be
applicable to Eldorado Mining and Refining (1944) Limited, which, as indicated
above, subsequently became Eldorado Nuclear Limited. It is s. 3 of the Government
Companies Operation Act that makes Eldorado “for all its purposes” an agent
of Her Majesty.

As with Uranium Canada, agreements relating to the sale and
supply of uranium fall within Eldorado’s corporate objects. I note, however,
that unlike Uranium Canada, Eldorado’s corporate objects do not restrict it to
acting with the approval of the Minister or the Governor in Council. Whatever
the de facto relationship between Eldorado and the government may be,
the Company’s corporate objects clauses and the relevant statutes leave it free
to operate without government direction.

Does Eldorado’s independence in any way affect its right to claim
Crown immunity? At common law the question whether a person is an agent or
servant of the Crown depends on the degree of control which the Crown, through
its ministers, can exercise over the performance of his or its duties. The
greater the control, the more likely it is that the person will be recognized
as a Crown agent. Where a person, human or corporate, exercises substantial
discretion, independent of ministerial control, the common law denies Crown

[Page 574]

agency status. The question is not how much independence the
person has in fact, but how much he can assert by reason of the terms of
appointment and nature of the official: Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V.
v. Administrator of Hungarian Property, [1954] A.C. 584 at pp. 616-17, and
see Hogg, Liability of the Crown, 1971, p. 207. While Uranium Canada
would easily meet the common law test of Crown agency, since it needs approval
of the Governor in Council for what it does, I think it is clear that the common
law would not recognize Eldorado as a Crown agent since it does not meet the de
jure control test. I do not, however, think that this deprives Eldorado of
the right of Crown immunity when acting within its corporate purposes.

The position at common law is not that those under de jure
control are entitled to Crown immunity, but rather that immunity extends to
those acting on behalf of the Crown. In Metropolitan Meat Industry Board v.
Sheedy, [1927] A.C. 899, the Privy Council found the Board not to be a Crown
agent because “there is nothing in the statute which makes the acts of
administration his [the Minister’s] as distinguished from theirs” (p. 905). Sheedy
is not an immunity case, rather, the question was whether Crown priority could
be asserted in a liquidation. Nevertheless, it does indicate that the de
jure test applies only in the absence of specific language indicating the
body acts on behalf of or as an agent of the Crown. See also Tamlin v.
Hannaford, [1950] 1 K.B. 18 (C.A.). A case such as British Columbia
Power Corp. v. Attorney-General of British Columbia (1962), 34 D.L.R. (2d)
25, is easily distinguishable. In that case the statutory designation of Crown
agent was held not to be conclusive, because the statute did not say “for all
its purposes”. The majority concluded the statute made the Power Corporation an
agent only for some

[Page 575]

purposes, not including the matter at issue in that appeal.

This Court’s decision in Formea Chemicals Ltd. v. Polymer
Corporation Ltd., supra, is also instructive. The case concerned s. 19 of
the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203.

The Government of Canada may, at any time, use any patented
invention, paying to the patentee such sum as the Commissioner reports to be a
reasonable compensation for the use thereof, and any decision of the
Commissioner under this section is subject to appeal to the Exchequer
 Court.

Martland J., speaking for the Court, equated “Government of
Canada” with the Crown. Polymer, like Eldorado, was made, for all its purposes,
an agent of the Crown, though not under de jure control. Nonetheless,
Polymer was held entitled to take advantage of s. 19.

In my opinion the Crown, under s. 19, has an unrestricted
right to use a patent. It caused the respondent [Polymer] to be incorporated to
manufacture, sell and deal in synthetic rubber and made the respondent, for all
its purposes, its agent. The use by the respondent of the patent was, in the
circumstances, a use by the Crown within s. 19. This being so, there was no
infringement by the respondent of such patent [at p. 764].

The “agent for all its purposes” designation was held to be
determinative; there was no inquiry into the actual independence of Polymer. I
think this case makes it clear that when an enactment refers to the Crown, and
a particular body is expressly made a Crown agent for all purposes, the
enactment embraces the statutory agent. This applies to the construction of
s. 16 of the Interpretation Act.

I also note that in the 1959 CBC case, supra, the
CBC was by statute an agent:

The Corporation is for all purposes of this Act an agent of
Her Majesty and its powers under this Act may be exercised only as an agent of
Her Majesty.

As noted in Locke J.’s concurring judgment, the CBC was not under
the regulation or direction of

[Page 576]

any department of government. Nevertheless, the majority found
the CBC entitled to immunity. The dissenting members of the Court agreed that
if the Crown had been immune under the Lord’s Day Act, that immunity
would have extended to the CBC.

The major difference between Uranium Canada and Eldorado is that
while the former is closely controlled by government, the latter, at least on
paper, is not. Yet the statutory provisions making both corporations Crown
agents for all their purposes are identical. I do not think it is admissible,
without rewriting the statutes, to interpret these identical provisions
differently. The status of Crown agents “for all its purposes” gives each such
agent the benefit of Crown immunity under s. 16 of the Interpretation Act.
The draftsmen of the governing statutes of Uranium Canada and Eldorado may well
have been thinking of immunity from taxing statutes rather than criminal
statutes, but the result is that there is immunity from both as long as the
corporations are acting within their respective authorized purposes.

The Attorney General’s “lawful Crown purposes” argument has
already been met by the conclusion that the two respondents are not bound by
the Combines Investigation Act when acting within authorized purposes,
so they cannot commit a violation of that Act when so acting. One additional
point ought to be made. The Attorney General contended that neither respondent
was given authority to contravene the Combines Investigation Act and
therefore Crown immunity was not available; Crown immunity would apply only if
there were statutory authority to contravene the Combines Investigation Act.
With respect, I do not think this is an appropriate form of analysis. Statutory
authority to commit an act that would otherwise be illegal, does not, it seems
to me, invoke Crown immunity. It gives rise to a defence of statutory
justification. A defence of statutory

[Page 577]

justification can be raised by any person, whether or not a Crown
agent. This is conceptually and analytically distant from Crown immunity.

IV Were the Prohibition Orders Premature?

There is nothing in the statutory framework or in the letters
patent of either Company to suggest that agreements or arrangements to lessen
competition in the production, sale or supply of uranium are extraneous to the
state purposes for which the two Companies were incorporated.

The Attorney General says, however, the prohibition orders in
this case were premature because the question whether either Company exceeded
its authority is a factual matter to be determined only upon evidence the
Attorney General will lead in proof of the charges at the preliminary inquiry,
and at subsequent trial if either Company should be committed for trial.

The Attorney General does not make any positive assertion that
Uranium Canada acted without approval of the Governor in Council. If the
Attorney General had evidence to this effect, or other evidence tending to show
that Uranium Canada or Eldorado acted for other than Crown purposes, he should
have so indicated by way of affidavit at the application before J. Holland J.
No such evidence was presented there, or alluded to here. This matter has now
been before three courts. In my opinion there is no merit in the submission
that the prohibition orders were premature. The Attorney General has had ample
opportunity to demonstrate, or at least assert categorically, that in entering
the allegedly unlawful agreements and combinations the two Companies acted for
other than Crown purposes. The Crown is immune from the Combines
Investigation Act; the respondents are agents of the Crown. Prima facie,
the conduct

[Page 578]

complained of is within the scope of Crown purposes for which the
Companies were incorporated, which, as found by J. Holland J., are to implement
national policy relating to atomic energy in all its aspects. Absent some
indication that the Companies acted outside corporate objects for other than
Crown purposes, they are immune from the terms of the Combines Investigation
Act as agents of the Crown, and the Provincial Court Judge lacked
jurisdiction to inquire into the charges. I would dismiss the appeals. No costs
are sought.

The reasons of Mclntyre and Wilson JJ. were delivered by

WILSON J. (dissenting in part)—I have had the benefit of
reading the reasons for judgment of my colleague, Dickson J., and must
respectfully disagree with his conclusion that both Eldorado Nuclear Limited
and Uranium Canada Limited are entitled to assert the Crown’s immunity from
prosecution under s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-23. In my view, only Uranium Canada is entitled to assert
such immunity.

The history of the proceedings is set out in my colleague’s
reasons for judgment and it is unnecessary for me to repeat it here. I agree
with my colleague’s conclusion that by virtue of s. 16 of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, the Crown is immune from prosecution under the Combines
Investigation Act. The issue before the Court however, as I see it, is
whether the respondent corporations can at this stage of the proceedings claim
the benefit of this immunity by virtue of their status as Crown agents.

Prima facie the resolution of this issue would appear to
involve a consideration of the alleged acts of the corporations in light of
their authorized objects and purposes. An inquiry would be

[Page 579]

required to determine whether or not such acts were within such
objects and purposes. It is submitted on behalf of the respondents, however,
that such an inquiry is unnecessary since the respondents are expressed in
their governing statutes to be for all their purposes agents of Her Majesty and
able to exercise their powers only as such. This, they say, means that no
matter what they do in carrying out their purposes, they are entitled to Her
Majesty’s immunity. Parliament has effectively equated their authority with
their capacity and the holding of a preliminary inquiry in these circumstances
would be a futile exercise.

Uranium Canada makes its claim to immunity on the basis of s.
10(4) of the Atomic Energy Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. A-19, which
reads:

A company is for all its purposes an agent of Her Majesty
and its powers may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty.

Eldorado’s claim is based on s. 3(1) of the Government
Companies Operation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.G-7, which states:

Every Company is for all its purposes an agent of Her
Majesty and its powers may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty.

Do these statutory provisions, by making a conclusive legislative
pronouncement on the status of the respondents as Crown agents, also provide
them with a blanket immunity from prosecution under the Combines
Investigation Act for any acts which they might perform in furtherance of
their statutory mandate? With respect, I do not think so.

In my view the authorities governing the scope of immunity of
Crown agents demonstrate that the courts must apply a two-step test in
determining whether an agent of the Crown is entitled to assert the Crown’s
immunity. The first step is to decide whether the agent is authorized,
expressly or impliedly, to perform the acts in question. In making this
determination it is not enough to say that the purpose for which the
acts are performed is an authorized purpose; the Court must also determine that
the means which the agent uses to accomplish the purpose are expressly
or impliedly

[Page 580]

authorized. If as a matter of statutory interpretation the means
are authorized, the agent is entitled to immunity. If, however, there is no
such authorization, the Court must move to the second step. The second step is
to decide whether or not the agent is, for all intents and purposes, the alter
ego of the Crown. If because of the degree of control—and by this is meant de
jure as opposed to de facto control—which the Crown is able to exercise
over the agent it is impossible for the Court to characterize the agent’s act
as anything other than the act of the Crown, the agent is entitled to assert
Crown immunity whether or not its governing statute authorizes the means by
which the agent carries out its statutory purposes. If, however, the Crown does
not have that degree of control, the agent will not be entitled to assert the
immunity if the means it used are outside the purview of the statute. I turn to
the authorities.

In R. v. Stradiotto, [1973] 2 O.R. 375, a member of the
Canadian Armed Forces was held not to be immune from prosecution under the
Ontario Highway Traffic Act even although he was acting under orders in
the course of his employment. Evans J.A., writing for the Ontario Court of
Appeal, said at p. 377:

The question for determination may be briefly stated: Is a
servant of the Crown immune from prosecution under the Highway Traffic Act
when he drives a motor vehicle in a negligent manner while in the course of
carrying out orders which can be obeyed without driving carelessly?

He concluded that he was not. The Court conceded in Stradiotto
that if the soldier had been ordered to do the very act alleged to constitute
the offence, he would be immune from prosecution. Evans J.A. said at p. 379:

In my view, a distinction must be drawn between a breach of
the Highway Traffic Act which is required to be committed by a soldier
in order to carry out a military order and a breach of the statute which a
soldier commits during the course of carrying out his duties which duties,
however, can be properly discharged without committing a breach of the statute.

In Conseil des Ports Nationaux v. Langelier, [1969] S.C.R.
60, the respondents, who were

[Page 581]

owners of properties bordering on the St. Lawrence River,
petitioned for an injunction to restrain the National Harbours Board from
carrying out certain works on the river which they claimed would injuriously
affect their properties. The Board moved by way of declinatory exception to
dismiss the respondents’ petition on the ground that, being an agent of the
Crown, it was not subject to injunction. The exception was dismissed at trial
and the trial judgment was affirmed on appeal. The Board was granted leave to
appeal to this Court. Mr. Justice Martland, speaking for the Court, dealt
with the argument made on behalf of the Board that it was only capable of
acting as a Crown agent and therefore enjoyed all the immunities of the Crown.
He said at p. 70:

What is in issue here is the responsibility of a person,
whether individual or corporate, who, though a Crown agent, and purporting to
act as such, commits an act which is unlawful. My understanding of the law is
that a personal liability will result. The liability arises, not because he is
an agent of the Crown, but because, though he is an agent of the Crown, the
plea of Crown authority will not avail in such event.

After reviewing a number of authorities Martland J. stated at p.
72:

As Choquette J. has pointed out, in the reasons for judgment
of the Court of Appeal, s. 3(2) of the National Harbours Board Act declares
that the Board “shall be and be deemed to be, for all the purposes of this
Act, the agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada”. (The italicizing is my
own.) It is only when the Board is lawfully executing the powers entrusted to
it by the Act that it is deemed to be a Crown agent.

I am not prepared to accept the proposition enunciated in Wheeler
v. Public Works Commissioners, [1903] 2 I.R. 202, that a corporation
constituted for the sole purpose of doing acts for the Crown is not capable of
doing a wrongful act in its corporate capacity, unless that statement is to be
limited in its meaning to say that such a wrongful act is not authorized by its
corporate powers. Otherwise the statement subscribes to the theory that a
corporation cannot be made liable in tort because its corporate powers do not
authorize it to commit a wrong. In my opinion, if a corporation, in the
purported carrying out of its corporate purposes, commits a wrongful act, it is
liable therefor and it cannot

[Page 582]

escape liability by alleging that it is not responsible for
anything done outside its corporate powers. This is true whether it is
purporting to act as a Crown agent, or not.

The National Harbour Board’s appeal was dismissed.

It has been suggested that there is a distinction to be drawn
between the Crown’s immunity at common law from an action in tort and its
immunity from liability or prosecution under a statute by virtue of s. 16 of
the Interpretation Act and that the observations of Martland J. in Conseil
des Ports Nationaux are confined to the former situation. With respect, I
think this is to read down the principle applied by the learned justice in the
case. The plaintiff, it will be recalled, was not seeking to enjoin the
National Harbours Board from commission of a common law tort but from
commission of a délit as contemplated by arts. 1053 et seq. of
the Civil Code. Any immunity which the National Harbours Board was
seeking to assert must accordingly have included immunity from provisions of
the Civil Code.

Although a number of the cases upon which Martland J. relied
involved the liability of public officials for tortious acts at common law, I
do not believe that he intended to confine his remarks to common law liability.
Rather, he seems to have espoused the broader principle which he quoted from
Dicey on The Law of the Constitution (10th ed., 1959), p. 193 to the
effect that Crown agents are personally liable “for acts done in their official
character but in excess of their lawful authority”. As an example of such an
act he refers to the violation of the Civil Code by the Quebec Liquor
Commission in Roncarelli v. Duplessis, [1959] S.C.R. 121.

Moreover, I do not believe that it is sound in principle to draw
a distinction in the present context between wrongs which are recognized by the
common law and those which are created by statute. In Tobin v. The Queen
(1864), 33 L.J.C.P. 199, Erle C.J. explained the principle that “the

[Page 583]

king can do no wrong” in the following way at p. 205:

The maxim that “the king can do no wrong” is true in the
sense that he is not liable to be sued civilly or criminally for a supposed
wrong; that which the sovereign does personally the law presumes will not be
wrong; that which the sovereign does by command to his servants cannot be a
wrong in the sovereign, because if the command be unlawful, it is in law no
command, and the servant is responsible for the unlawful act in the same way as
if there had been no command.

(Emphasis added.)

The principle thus stated recognizes that the servants and agents
of the Crown are under an obligation to obey the law which is enforceable in
the courts even if the sovereign’s personal obligation to do so is not
enforceable in the same manner. To remove breaches of statute from the ambit of
this principle would create an enormous range of executive action which would
not be subject to independent judicial control.

Mr. Justice Estey, writing for the Court in the recent
decision in Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. The Queen, [1983] 1
S.C.R. 339, seems to have approved the reasoning in both Conseil des Ports
Nationaux and Stradiotto. He stated at p. 343:

There is no doubt that in the existing state of the law
employees of the Crown are responsible for their own acts done in their
official character but in excess of their lawful authority.

And later he says at pp. 351-52:

The appellant is certainly in no better position than a
minister of the Crown. It is difficult to believe that after the great constitutional
struggles through which we and our forebears have gone to bring to an end the
concept of the absolute monarchy we are still faced with the defence of
absolute immunity by the monarch’s administration. Borrowing the words of
Martland J., in Conseil des Ports Nationaux, supra: “It is only when the
(Corporation) is lawfully executing the powers entrusted to it by the Act that
it is deemed to be the Crown agent” (at p. 72). When so acting and thereby
enjoying the status of Crown agent the immunities of the Crown flow through to
the agent for its benefit. Where, however, the Corporation is not acting “for
all purposes of this Act”

[Page 584]

or with reference to “its powers under this Act” the status
and the benefits of Crown agency disappear.

The attribution of Crown immunity to the appellant may be an
issue in circumstances not here before the Court and hence need not, for the
disposition of this appeal, be determined. However, even if Crown immunity may
be attributed to the appellant in some circumstances, and the actions of the
appellant in such circumstances attributed to the Crown, it does not
necessarily follow that the immunities attendant upon the status of Crown
agency will flow through to the benefit and protection of the appellant in all circumstances.
Here we have the Attorney General of the Province of Ontario prosecuting
charges under the federal Criminal Code  against a corporation
established by the Parliament of Canada. The former brings the charges in the
course of its duty to enforce the criminal law in the province and the latter
is called upon to answer those charges by reason of its corporate existence and
responsibilities under the Broadcasting Act . There is no authorization
given by Parliament in its parent statute for the conduct of the appellant. The
law reveals no reason why Her Majesty as the fountainhead of justice should not
invoke the powers of the criminal courts to enforce a statute which expressly
makes Her Majesty’s agents subject to its terms. But even that is not the case
before us. There certainly can be no reason in law why the law enforcement
agencies should not bring before the criminal court a corporation, however
established, or any other person, where the conduct of that person, natural or
legal, offends the Criminal Code  and is not expressly authorized by Act
of Parliament. We are not here concerned with whether the same principle would
apply to conduct expressly authorized by another legislature acting within its
plenary competence.

These cases seem to me to be authority for the proposition that
the fact that an individual or a corporation enjoys the status of an agent of
the Crown is not conclusive of his right to immunity. The agent will be
personally liable for acts carried out beyond the scope of his authority and
his authority must be closely examined in order to determine whether the means
he used in carrying out his mandate were authorized or not. Following the
approach taken by Evans J.A. in Stradiotto, I would find that where
there is no express authorization to perform the alleged acts, the courts
should presume that acts which violate the law are

[Page 585]

the unauthorized acts of the agent for which he will be
personally liable. The onus should be on the agent to show that he could not
carry out his mandate without the commission of such acts.

Without commenting on the correctness of their decision, I think
that the majority of this Court in Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v.
Attorney-General for Ontario, [1959] S.C.R. 188, took a similar approach to
the question of whether the C.B.C. was entitled to assert Crown immunity from
prosecution under the Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171 (now R.S.C.
1970, c. L-13), for broadcasting on a Sunday. The statutory mandate in that
case was to “carry on a national broadcasting service within Canada”. The
majority treated that as a mandate to broadcast free of any limitation as to
time. Since it would frustrate the corporation in the exercise of its mandate
if the prohibition in the Lord’s Day Act applied to it, it had implied
authority to broadcast on a Sunday and was entitled to the immunity for so
doing.

By applying for an order of prohibition at this stage of the
proceedings the respondents in this case have made it impossible for the courts
to assess whether or not the acts alleged were necessary to enable the
respondents to carry out their statutory mandate.

It has been argued that by confining the scope of the Crown
agent’s immunity to those acts which were authorized the Court would be
destroying the principle of Crown immunity. The argument is that Crown agents
do not need immunity when they are carrying out acts within the scope of their
authority. Since the Crown can act only through agents, it is said, the
restriction of Crown immunity to the authorized acts of agents deprives the
immunity of any substance. With respect, I do not think that this is so. In my
view the common law authorities demonstrate that where the Crown agent’s
capacity to act was so circumscribed that any act done in the course of his duties
must be viewed as an act of the Crown itself, he was entitled to assert Crown
immunity. The test, as set

[Page 586]

out in the House of Lords’ decision in Bank voor Handel en
Scheepvaart N.V. v. Administrator of Hungarian Property, [1954] A.C. 584, is
whether the Crown exercises de jure control over the agent. As Lord Reid
put it at p. 617:

The question is not how much independence the [agent] in
fact enjoys but how much he can assert and insist on by reason of the terms of
his appointment or the nature of his office.

I do not see why the common law principle is not equally
applicable to individuals or corporations who have been designated by statute
as Crown agents. If those agents have the capacity to act for their own
purposes as well as for purposes of the Crown, they will be entitled to
immunity only to the extent that they act for purposes of the Crown. The fact
that they are designated by statute to be Crown agents for all their purposes
does not in my view preclude their acting for purposes of their own if they
have the capacity to do so. I believe that the authorities bear out this
analysis.

In British Columbia Power Corp. v. Attorney-General of British
Columbia (1962), 34 D.L.R. (2d) 25 (B.C.C.A.), the issue was whether a
public utility, the sole shareholder of which was the Crown in right of British
Columbia, was immune from discovery and inspection in a suit by former
shareholders. The utility claimed the immunity on the basis that under s. 6(1)
of the governing statute it was stated to be “an agent of Her Majesty the Queen
in right of the Province”. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council had the power to
appoint the directors of the utility and to name someone to exercise all the
powers, rights and duties of the Crown as a shareholder.

The utility argued that s. 6(1) made it an agent of the Crown
“for all purposes with power to act only as agent”. Sheppard J.A. said that he
had difficulty with that submission because it added words which were not
present in the section. Moreover, he pointed out at p. 31 of his reasons that

[Page 587]

even if those words had been in the section “the agency so
defined does not necessarily bring the agent within the immunity”. The issue
was whether the utility had “by the statute in question become an agent within
the prerogative” so as to be entitled to the Crown’s immunity. This had to be
determined by the true interpretation of the statute as a whole. Sheppard J.A.
said that:

In construing the statute, regard should be had to those
tests applied in determining whether or not there is such an agency as to come
within the prerogative of the Crown and the immunity from discovery.

He found that the utility was not entitled to the Crown’s
immunity.

In the course of his reasons Sheppard J.A. considered whether the
corporation had a contractual capacity apart from the Crown and he reviewed the
powers of the corporation, including the power to sue and be sued and the power
to enter into contracts in its own name. At page 35 he concluded that the
utility could aptly be described in the words of Lord Justice Denning (as he
then was) in Tamlin v. Hannaford, [1950] 1 K.B. 18, at p. 24:

In the eye of the law, the corporation is its own master and
is answerable as fully as any other person or corporation. It is not the Crown
and has none of the immunities or privileges of the Crown. Its servants are not
civil servants, and its property is not Crown property. It is as much bound by
Acts of Parliament as any other subject of the King. It is, of course, a public
authority and its purposes, no doubt, are public purposes, but it is not a
government department nor do its powers fall within the province of government.

DesBrisay C.J.B.C., the other member of the majority in the British
Columbia Power Corp. case, held that since s. 6(1) did not expressly
designate the utility as an agent of the Crown for all purposes, it was not
entitled to assert Crown immunity from discovery when it was acting pursuant to
the directions of the legislature rather than as agent of the Crown. In my
view, however, the reasoning of Sheppard J.A. embraces the broader principle
that a legislative pronouncement to the effect that a corporation is a Crown
agent

[Page 588]

for all its purposes does not deprive the corporation of the
capacity to act for purposes of its own as opposed to those of the Crown. For
example, in Conseil des Ports Nationaux the National Harbours Board had
been deemed a Crown agent for all the purposes of the National Harbours
Board Act. This did not prevent the courts from finding that the National
Harbours Board was sufficiently independent from the Crown that it could be
held personally liable for tortious acts committed in the course of carrying
out its mandate and that it could be enjoined from causing the plaintiffs
further injury through such acts.

I do not think that Metropolitan Meat Industry Board v.
Sheedy, [1927] A.C. 899, and Formea Chemicals Ltd. v. Polymer
Corporation Ltd., [1968] S.C.R. 754, are at all in conflict with this
reasoning. In Sheedy the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
considered the question whether the Board was entitled to assert the Crown’s
priority in the collection of debts owed to it by a company in liquidation. The
court examined the legislation setting up the Board and found that it was a
body with discretionary powers of its own. Accordingly, it determined that the
Board could not be described as an agent of the Crown. The court observed at p.
905 that “Even if a Minister of the Crown has power to interfere with them [the
Board], there is nothing in the statute which makes the acts of administration
his as distinguished from theirs”. This observation, in my view, simply
confirms that, viewed as a whole, the statute could not be said to have
subjected the Board to the de jure control of the Crown.

In the Formea Chemicals case this Court addressed the
question of whether the respondent Crown corporation had infringed the
appellant’s patent. The majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal (per
McLennan J.A.) held that Formea could not maintain an action of patent infringement
against Polymer because the latter was immune from suit on the basis that it
was an agent

[Page 589]

of the Crown ([1967] 1 O.R. 546). Wells J.A. dissented.

Mr. Justice Martland, writing for this Court, held that
Formea’s appeal should be dismissed. He said at p. 758:

While I have reached the conclusion that the appeal fails,
my reasons are not the same as those of the majority in the Court of Appeal.

It is unnecessary to determine, in the circumstances of the
present case, what may be the liability of an agent of the Crown, which,
without lawful authority, infringes upon the rights of others. I do not base my
decision upon, nor do I adopt the general proposition that an action in tort
will not lie as against an agent of the Crown.

Mr. Justice Martland decided the case on the basis that s.
19  of the Patent Act  which gave the Crown the right to use the patent
accrued to the benefit of Polymer because it was a Crown agent. He did not
approach the case as a claim of Crown immunity by Polymer but rather as a
question of the construction of s. 19  of the Patent Act  to determine
whether the right conferred by it on the Crown was available to Crown agents.

This Court’s recent decision in Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation v. The Queen deals, in my view, with a somewhat different
situation. In that case the question was whether the C.B.C. could assert Crown
immunity from prosecution for broadcasting an obscene film. The Radio (T.V.)
Broadcasting Regulations expressly prohibited the broadcast of any
obscene presentation. The Court held that although the C.B.C. was by statute
declared to be a Crown agent for all its purposes, it could hardly be within
the scope of its purposes to present a film which the regulations prohibited it
from broadcasting. The fact that this analysis was apt for the case before the
Court does not in my estimation mean that the only way an agent who has been
designated by statute as a Crown agent for all purposes can forfeit Crown
immunity is by committing an act which lies outside the scope of its statutory
purposes.

[Page 590]

I would approach the issue in the present case by following the
path laid out by the authorities already referred to. How then do they apply?

In my view there is nothing in the governing statutes of either
of the respondents to indicate that they were expressly or impliedly authorized
to carry out their statutory purposes by engaging in violations of the Combines
Investigation Act. It may be that the respondents could mount a case that
the only way in which they could carry out their mandate effectively was
through the acts alleged by the Crown. This question is not, however, before
the Court at this stage of the proceedings and any resolution of the issue
would have to await the outcome of a factual inquiry. It seems to me,
therefore, that neither respondent can be said to be entitled at this stage to
assert Crown immunity under the first step of the two-step test for immunity i.e.
express or implied authorization.

Turning to step two—the de jure control test—I think that
a distinction must be drawn between Uranium Canada and Eldorado. Uranium Canada
operates under the direction of the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and
exercises its powers “subject to the approval of the Governor in Council”. The
identity between Uranium Canada and the Crown is accordingly just about as
close as it could be. If the Governor in Council approved the alleged illegal
acts of Uranium Canada I agree that Uranium Canada should be entitled to the
Crown’s immunity.

Eldorado, on the other hand, has a wide measure of latitude with
respect to the way in which it exercises its corporate powers. Indeed, I can
find nothing in the governing legislation or in its Letters Patent to require
it to respond to government directives. It is trite law that a corporation is a
separate entity from its shareholders and that it is to the corporation and not
the shareholders that the directors’ duties are owed. It seems to me,
therefore, that Eldorado’s capacity exceeds its authority as agent of the Crown
and that it can have “purposes” of its own. If this is so, I do not believe

[Page 591]

that its agency status is conclusive of its right to immunity.

The corporate powers of Eldorado are found in its Letters Patent
and Supplementary Letters Patent and in The Companies Act, 1934, 1934
(Can.), c. 33, pursuant to which it was incorporated. Under its principal
objects it has the usual powers of a mining company in relation to the
exploration for and development of mines and minerals. These powers were
expanded by Supplementary Letters Patent in 1968 to add:

and to purchase, lease, mine, refine, process and sell
uranium, zirconium or any other material or equipment relative to the nuclear
industry.

It also has extensive ancillary powers under both The
Companies Act, 1934 and the Government Companies Operation Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. G-7, including the power to contract in its own name, employ
its own officers and servants, and sue and be sued in its own name.

There is nothing in the Letters Patent, Supplementary Letters
Patent or the governing statutes to permit the government or the Minister to
interfere with the operation of the corporation. I note, for example, that
pursuant to s. 73 of the Financial Administration Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
F-10, “the Governor in Council may make regulations with respect to the
conditions upon which an agency corporation may undertake contractual
commitments”. An “agency corporation” means a corporation named in Schedule C
of the Act and Uranium Canada is a Schedule C corporation. Eldorado, however,
is a “proprietary corporation” or a Schedule D corporation for purposes of the
Act and no similar powers of interference in corporate operations is authorized
in respect of this type of Crown corporation. Article 8 of the Financial
Administration Act provides the government only with a certain element of
fiscal, as opposed to operational, control over proprietary or Schedule D
corporations. It is, in my view, quite unrealistic to treat Eldorado either as
a matter of fact or a

[Page 592]

matter of law as the alter ego of the Crown in exercising
all its powers.

In my view the preceding analysis is in accordance not only with
authority but with sound policy. It seems to me that when Parliament wishes to
give the executive the special powers and immunities it requires to carry out
particular government responsibilities, it should do so in clear and
unequivocal terms and not rely on either the common law doctrine of Crown
immunity or s. 16 of the Interpretation Act. I think this is
particularly true when it wishes to authorize illegal acts. I see no reason why
the Court should contribute to a weakening of Parliamentary control over the
executive branch of government by holding that a statutorily conferred agency
status is conclusive of the agent’s right to immunity.

I have serious doubts that Parliament ever intended the
respondents to have a carte blanche to engage in illegal activities on
behalf of the Crown and to encourage other citizens to do likewise. The words
of Taschereau J., dissenting in Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v.
Attorney-General of Ontario, supra, at p. 195 come readily to
mind:

I am quite satisfied that it never entered the mind of
Parliament that C.B.C. could not be reached by the statute, while all the other
private stations, not agents of the Crown, and which are now on an equal
footing with the appellant, would be amenable to the law.

We might ask in this case whether Parliament ever contemplated
that the respondents would go about the implementation of their statutory
purposes by means of an illegal conspiracy with others, counting on the
protection of their Crown immunity and leaving their co-conspirators to the
full rigours of the law. In the case of Uranium Canada we at least have the
comfort of knowing that the corporation is incapable of acting without the
approval of the Governor in Council. With respect to Eldorado we have no
comfort at all.

[Page 593]

For the reasons given I would dismiss the appeal with respect to
Uranium Canada and allow it with respect to Eldorado.

1970, c. E-21, ss. 3, 13, 16.

Appellant brought extradition proceedings
against respondent Piperno. At the extradition hearings, the Extradition Judge
refused to admit in evidence three documents in the form of unsworn depositions
made pursuant to Italian law. Appellant’s application for mandamus to compel
the Extradition Judge to admit the unsworn depositions was dismissed by the
Federal Court Trial Division and the Federal Court of Appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Mandamus does not lie unless jurisdiction is
in issue respecting the performance of a statutory duty, as where there is a
denial or excess of jurisdiction. Here, even if the Extradition Judge were
wrong in rejecting the unsworn depositions because they lacked quality as admissible
evidence, his ruling could not be reviewed by way of mandamus since no question
of jurisdiction was involved.

[Page 321]

Although article XI of the Extradition
Treaty dealt only with sworn depositions, s. 16  of the Extradition
Act  provided for depositions taken in a foreign state under oath or by
affirmation. Since Italian law did not provide expressly for affirmations or
sworn depositions in proceeding before a juge d’instruction, the Extradition
Treaty should be given a liberal interpretation to admit affirmations and
to accept as affirmations depositions taken in circumstances where the deponent
recognizes the importance of the truth being told on the particular occasion.
Therefore, the two depositions of the deponents, who had been warned of their
duties to tell the truth and were aware of penal consequences if they did not,
were admissible. The deposition of the third deponent, however, was
inadmissible since she was in no jeopardy and had accepted no obligation to
tell the truth.

Appeal dismissed.

Joseph Nuss, Q.C., for the appellant.

Pierre Poupart and Michel F. Denis, for
the respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This case raises a question of
substance and a question of procedure. It arises out of extradition proceedings
in which the question of substance concerned the admissibility in evidence
before the Extradition Judge of certain depositions, tendered on behalf of the
Government of the Republic of
Italy in seeking to extradite the respondent Francesco Piperno. Boilard J.,
sitting

[Page 322]

as Extradition Judge, held the depositions to be
inadmissible. Other depositions of like character were in readiness for
submission but, having regard to the ruling of Boilard J., counsel for the
Italian Government decided to test it. He brought mandamus with certiorari in
aid, seeking to quash the ruling and to compel the Extradition Judge to carry
out a duty said to arise under article XI of the applicable Extradition
Treaty to receive the proffered depositions and others like them. Thus
arose the question of procedure, namely, whether mandamus would lie in respect
of the allegedly erroneous ruling.

The Extradition Judge’s ruling did not end the
proceeding before him. He made no order of dismissal nor, of course, any order
of committal. Whatever be the outcome of this appeal, the extradition
proceeding remains on foot before him. It may properly be said, therefore, that
the courts before whom mandamus was sought, either at first instance or on
appeal, are concerned with an interlocutory proceeding. So too is this Court.

The application for mandamus came before Addy J.
of the Federal Court, Trial Division, pursuant to s. 18 of the Federal
Court Act, R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 10. Addy J. dismissed the
application on two grounds; first, on the ground that mandamus did not lie when
there was no jurisdictional error and, second, on the merits of the issue of
admissibility. An appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal was dismissed in short
reasons limited to the question whether mandamus would lie. That Court held
that any error committed by the Extradition Judge was made in the exercise of
jurisdiction. No opinion was expressed on admissibility. Leave to appeal was
obtained to come here.

The extradition proceedings

Piperno was arrested in Quebec on an extradition warrant on September 18, 1981. He was admitted to bail
and has been at liberty since October 15, 1981. The extradition hearing began
on October 21, 1981. Three
documents in the form

[Page 323]

of unsworn depositions were offered in evidence
to the Extradition Judge. Each was made to or before a juge d’instruction in
Rome by the following three
persons, Stefano Lepri, Francesco Cipullo and Guiliana Conforto.

The deposition of Lepri, dated October 21, 1979,
is signed by him by the juge d’instruction and contains the stamped seal
of a civil and criminal tribunal of Rome. It begins with a warning to the deponent of his obligation to tell
the truth, in conformity with art. 357 of the Italian Code of Penal
Procedure, and recites that he has been informed of penal consequences
under art. 372 of the Italian Penal Code if he gives false
testimony. The deposition of Cipullo, dated November 21, 1979, is similarly signed and
sealed and contains the same warning of the duty to tell the truth and of penal
consequences if false testimony is given. There is this difference however in
the two depositions; that of Cipullo refers to an earlier statement to the
police made on May 3, 1979.

The Conforto deposition, unsworn like the other
two, is dated January 24, 1980.
It differs from them, however, because as a person charged with offences
(although unrelated to those charged against Piperno) she was not required to
answer when interrogated before a juge d’instruction and was not warned
of the duty to tell the truth and of penal consequences if false testimony is
given. She was only warned of consequences if she refused to answer or if she
gave untrue answers with respect to her name and other particulars.

The depositions were taken in alleged conformity
with Italian law and expert evidence as to that law was adduced before the
Extradition Judge. I shall come to it shortly.

No issue was raised as to the relevancy of the
depositions if they were admissible. Attention was, however, directed to
article XI of the Extradition Treaty entered into between Great Britain and Italy in 1873 and which admittedly applies to Canada. Article XI reads as follows:

[Page 324]

ARTICLE
XI.

In the examinations to be made in
conformity with the preceding stipulations, the authorities of the State to
which the demand is addressed shall admit, as entirely valid evidence, the
documents and depositions taken on oath in the other State, or copies of them,
and likewise the warrants and sentences issued there; provided that such
documents are signed or certified by a Judge, Magistrate, or Officer of such
State, and are authenticated by the oath of some witness, or stamped with the
official seal of the Department of Justice or some other Department of State.

This Extradition Treaty is incorporated
as part of the domestic law of Canada under s. 3 of the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21
which is in these terms:

3. In the
case of any foreign state with which there is an extradition arrangement, this
Part applies during the continuance of such arrangement; but no provision of
this Part that is inconsistent with any of the terms of the arrangement has
effect to contravene the arrangement; and this Part shall be so read and
construed as to provide for the execution of the arrangement.

Although ss. 13 and 16 of this Act were brought
into account by the respondent, it is clear from s. 3 aforesaid that
treaty provisions prevail against them if they are inconsistent. It is
desirable, however, to reproduce them in their terms, as follows:

13. The
fugitive shall be brought before a judge, who shall, subject to this Part, hear
the case, in the same manner, as nearly as may be, as if the fugitive was
brought before a justice of the peace, charged with an indictable offence
committed in Canada.

…

16.
Depositions or statements taken in a foreign state on oath, or on affirmation,
where affirmation is allowed by the law of the state, and copies of such
depositions or statements and foreign certificates of, or judicial documents
stating the fact of conviction, may, if duly authenticated, be received in
evidence in proceedings under this Part.

I come now to consider the expert evidence of
applicable Italian law. It was given before judge Boilard by Mr. Alberto
Sciollo, a judge of the Italian Cour de cassation who, at the time, was
in Montreal on leave from his
judicial post to repre-

[Page 325]

sent his country in the International Civil
Aviation Organization, whose headquarters are in Montreal. He gave uncontradicted evidence.

According to the witness, a criminal proceeding
under Italian law has a pre-trial stage before a juge d’instruction (like
a preliminary hearing here, as I assess it) and, on sufficient proof to satisfy
the juge d’instruction, an accused is sent to trial before the Assizes Court. There is no provision under
Italian law for taking sworn testimony at the pre-trial stage unless because of
illness a witness may not be available at the trial and excepting also
testimony as to identification of an accused. However, a witness before the juge
d’instruction is warned of penal consequences if he gives false evidence.
The warning of penal consequences if false testimony is given does not apply,
however, in the case of a witness himself or herself accused in another case.
Such a witness cannot testify under oath even at the trial proper, but the
evidence of the witness may be acted on by the trial judge to convict an
accused on that evidence alone, although given without any warning of penal
consequences if it is false.

The relevant provisions of Italian law,
art. 357 of the Code of Penal Procedure and art. 372 of the Penal
Code, read as follows (as translated from the French translation in the
record):

[TRANSLATION] 357. (Acts prior to the
deposition; swearing of witnesses for future purposes). Each witness shall be
heard separately. The judge shall advise him of his duty to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, and make known to him the penalties applicable
to persons guilty of perjury (372 Penal Code). He shall then question him as to
his personal identification and any relationship of consanguinity or interest
which he may have with the other parties to the proceeding, or as to other
circumstances that may be useful in assessing his credibility. He shall then
proceed to examine the witness.

[Page 326]

Witnesses shall not take oaths in the
preliminary hearing, unless the law provides otherwise (313, 363). The judge
shall in addition receive the deposition on oath of the witnesses he considers
necessary, when he anticipates that, for reasons of health or other serious
impediment, they may not appear in court[1].
In such cases the usual transcript shall be prepared, and the judge may direct,
of his own motion or at the request of the prosecution or of one of the other
parties (provided always that the necessary equipment is available), that the
deposition shall be reproduced using recording apparatus (496 bis). The witness
shall take oath according to article 449 (4622).

All the foregoing shall be mentioned in the
transcript (155 foll.).

In cases of recorded depositions the
provisions of paragraphs one, two, three and four of article 496 bis[2] shall apply.

…

372) (Perjury). Any person who, in giving a
deposition as a witness before a judicial authority, states a falsehood or
denies what is true, or withholds in whole or in part what he knows concerning
the facts on which he is questioned, shall be liable to imprisonment of from
six months to three years (375-377, 384; 349-352, 359, 458 C.P.P.).

In refusing to admit the proffered depositions
judge Boilard acted on the submission of counsel for Piperno that depositions
given neither under oath nor on affirmation did not satisfy the requirements of
the applicable law. Judge Boilard appeared to apply Canadian standards, as, for
example, those under the Criminal Code  respecting preliminary inquiries
and provisions of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10,
respecting taking of evidence under oath or affirmation, on the view that there
was consonance between the Treaty and Canadian law so as to justify advertence
to such law. His reasons suggest that even if there was inconsistency between
the Treaty and otherwise applicable Canadian law, there was a question of
Canadian public policy involved requiring preference for Canadian law under
which evidence must be given on oath or by

[Page 327]

affirmation. He did not find the English case of
R. v. Governor of Pentonville Prison, ex parte Singh, [1981] 3 All E.R.
23, persuasive in its holding, inter alia, that a treaty provision
referring to “sworn depositions or statements” should be liberally construed to
extend to affirmations. This case was heavily relied on by counsel for the
appellant Government and I will consider it in due course.

The mandamus proceedings

I have already noted that Addy J. denied
mandamus. He did so because it was not a procedure open to challenge
admissibility of evidence when there was no excess of jurisdiction or refusal
to exercise jurisdiction and when the extradition proceedings had not yet
concluded. His support of the ruling of judge Boilard on the merits was
supplemented by holding the Singh case to be inapplicable to Canada and
by asserting the strong policy that prevailed in Canada, especially having
regard to s. 13  of the Extradition Act , against subjecting an
individual to extradition process otherwise than in conformity with Canadian
law, as reflected in s. 16  of the Extradition Act .

The Federal Court of Appeal refused to express
an opinion on the admissibility of the depositions but held, as I have already
said, that even assuming that judge Boilard was wrong in his ruling, mandamus
would not lie.

It was the strong submission of counsel for the
Government of Italy that the right to mandamus, the right to require the
Extradition Judge to perform a statutory duty, arose under article XI of the Extradition
Treaty which imperatively (“shall admit”) directed the admission of
evidence as therein specified. The difficulty with this submission, giving it
all the force which counsel sees in it, is that as a term of a treaty it must
be, so to speak, domesticated to be enforceable in Canada and its domestic
effect depends on the application of s. 3  of the Extradition Act  and
thus brings into

[Page 328]

account a number of considerations canvassed by
both judge Boilard and judge Addy. On this view, I do not see how article XI of
the Treaty can be treated as resting on a statutory duty going to the
jurisdiction of the Extradition Judge.

A line of cases in this Court, among them Rourke
v. The Queen, [1978] S.C.R. 1021, at p. 1026 and Dressler v.
Tallman Gravel & Sand Supply Ltd., [1962] S.C.R. 564, at p. 569
have affirmed that mandamus does not lie unless jurisdiction is in issue
respecting the performance of a statutory duty as where there is a denial or
excess of jurisdiction. Moreover, the cases, for example R. v. N., [1980]
1 W.W.R. 68 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 72-73, point to a denial of mandamus where the
question to which mandamus is addressed is admissibility of evidence. Nor is
the appellant assisted in claiming mandamus by the judgment of this Court in Kipp
v. Attorney-General for Ontario, [1965] S.C.R. 57. This Court affirmed the
issue of mandamus in that case where the trial judge had wrongly quashed an
indictment before plea on the ground of duplicity when he should have tried the
charge before him.

Counsel for the appellant urged that the line
between refusing to accept evidence and refusing to accept jurisdiction can be
a thin one and that the distinction has no validity in this case, relying for
this position on R. v. Marsham, [1892] 1 Q.B. 371. It also was implicit
in his submission that the liberality of approach when international comity is
involved, as it is here, should extend not only to substantive matters, but
also to procedures of the domestic court.

Whatever disposition there may be to take a wide
view of jurisdiction in order to support mandamus, I can find no basis upon
which that remedy can be available here. First, the Marsham case does
not help. Although mandamus was held to lie

[Page 329]

to a magistrate where he rejected evidence, the
English Court of Appeal held that what happened amounted to a declining of
jurisdiction as to the whole inquiry before him. This was because, unlike the
case where evidence is wrongly rejected on the view that it would not prove the
matter into which the magistrate was bound to inquire, there the evidence was
rejected (when it was integral to the inquiry) whether or not it would prove
the matter in issue. The distinction is between rejection of evidence going to
the entire inquiry because of its character and rejecting evidence because of
its quality as proof. In the present case, the rejection of the evidence was
not because its character was such that no evidence of that kind could be
adduced but because it lacked quality as admissible evidence on the issues
before the Extradition Judge. Even if he was wrong in rejecting it, his ruling
could not be reviewed by way of mandamus, no question of jurisdiction being
involved.

Second, the Extradition Judge did not stultify
the inquiry before him by his evidence ruling. Judge Addy noted in the
concluding paragraph of his reasons that art. 449 of the Italian Code
of Penal Procedure envisages the use of affidavits and of solemn
affirmations and, after proper authentication, could be used in extradition
proceedings. Article 449 was, by consent, added in its French translation
to the record on appeal. It reads as follows [translation from the French
translation in the Record]:

[TRANSLATION] 449. (Swearing of witnesses).
All witnesses, even in the capacity of informant (7 et seq.),
complainant (9 et seq.) or civil party (91), shall take an oath, if they
have not previously sworn (357*, 418**) and if they are not expressly exempted
by law from doing so.

The presiding judge or the trial judge,
having duly complied with the provisions of article 142, shall cause the
witnesses to be sworn individually, as each of them appears to be heard, and
shall use the following formula:

[Page 330]

“Aware of the responsibility which you
assume before God[3] and
man, do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?”

No person shall be allowed to take an oath
who, at the time he gives evidence, has not reached his fourteenth birthday.
Nevertheless, the judge shall advise him of his duty to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, and apprise him of the action which may be ordered
with respect to persons less than fourteen years old who commit an act which
the law regards as an offence (224 Penal C.).

Counsel for the appellant contended that the
reference to art. 449 by judge Addy was improper and was in the face of
the expert evidence that sworn evidence can only be given under Italian law at
trial at the public hearing and not before a juge d’instruction. Accepting the
contention that art. 449 could not be invoked to supply affidavit evidence
in this case, I cannot regard judge Bollard’s ruling as amounting to a denial
of jurisdiction, unless it could be said that even if Italian witnesses were
brought before him (and none were so brought) he would exclude their evidence
because of its character and not because of its allegedly irrelevant quality in
the particular circumstances.

Third, the procedural remedies of the domestic
court, invoked by way of review or appeal of rulings of an Extradition Judge,
owe nothing to the Extradition Treaty. None of the Treaty’s terms affect
the review or appeal procedures of the domestic court. It is the domestic law
alone that determines what review or other remedies can be brought to bear upon
extradition rulings or extradition decisions.

In my opinion, therefore, the Courts below were
right in holding that mandamus did not lie.

Was any other form of relief available?

In the course of argument by the appellant, a
question was put from the Bench as to whether

[Page 331]

review of judge Boilard’s ruling could be
obtained by an invocation of the Federal Court of Appeal’s jurisdiction under
s. 28  of the Federal Court Act . That provision reads as follows:

28. (1)
Notwithstanding section 18 or the provisions of any other Act, the Court
of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear and determine an application to review and
set aside a decision or order, other than a decision or order of an
administrative nature not required by law to be made on a judicial or
quasi-judicial basis, made by or in the course of proceedings before a federal
board, commission or other tribunal, upon the ground that the board, commission
or tribunal

(a) failed to observe a
principle of natural justice or otherwise acted beyond or refused to exercise
its jurisdiction;

(b) erred in law in making
its decision or order, whether or not the error appears on the face of the
record; or

(c) based its decision or order on
an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or
without regard for the material before it.

(2) Any such application may be made by the
Attorney General of Canada or any party directly affected by the decision or
order by filing a notice of the application in the Court within ten days of the
time the decision or order was first communicated to the office of the Deputy
Attorney General of Canada or to that party by the board, commission or other
tribunal, or within such further time as the Court of Appeal or a judge thereof
may, either before or after the expiry of those ten days, fix or allow.

(3) Where the Court of Appeal has
jurisdiction under this section to hear and determine an application to
review and set aside a decision or order, the Trial Division has no
jurisdiction to entertain any proceeding in respect of that decision or order.

(4) A federal board, commission or other
tribunal to which subsection (1) applies may at any stage of its
proceedings refer any question or issue of law, of jurisdiction or of practice
and procedure to the Court of Appeal for hearing and determination.

(5) An application or reference to the
Court of Appeal made under this section shall be heard and determined
without delay and in a summary way.

[Page 332]

(6) Notwithstanding subsection (1), no
proceeding shall be taken thereunder in respect of a decision or order of the
Governor in Council, the Treasury Board, a superior court or the Pension
Appeals Board or in respect of a proceeding for a service offence under the National
Defence Act .

If I am correct in my assessment of the present
case as involving an interlocutory proceeding, a question arises whether it may
be the subject of review under s. 28(1). The case law in the Federal
Court, and especially in the Federal Court of Appeal, has tended to the view
that a “decision or order” under s. 28(1) means a final determination: see
Mullan, The Federal Court Act : Administrative Law Jurisdiction (1977),
at pp. 22 et seq., prepared for the Law Reform Commission of Canada. I
am far from wishing to be categorical on this issue because to explore it would
be wrong when there was no consideration given to it in the Federal Court of
Appeal and when counsel for the respondent asserted that he was taken by
surprise when the matter was raised.

It would be improper, therefore, to turn this
mandamus proceeding into something else not heretofore considered. I should not
leave s. 28  without adverting to the provisions of s. 28(4) but,
again, I cannot consider this to be before this Court for the determination of
its application here.

The admissibility of the evidence

Although my view that mandamus does not lie is
enough to dispose of this appeal here, as it was similarly disposed of in the
Federal Court of Appeal, the substantive issue is of considerable importance
and deserves to be addressed, as it was by counsel before this Court and as it
was by Addy J. at first instance in the Federal Court. Moreover, since the
extradition hearing has not yet concluded and remains alive before judge
Boilard, a multiplicity of proceedings will be avoided if the merit of his
ruling is reviewed now rather than awaiting a final decision from him on the
request for extradition.

[Page 333]

There are two critical questions that must be
answered in assessing the correctness of judge Boilard’s ruling and its
affirmation by judge Addy. The first is whether article XI of the Extradition
Treaty is an exclusive reference to admissible documents or depositions,
and only if taken on oath and authenticated by oath or by official seal, or
whether it permits also documents or depositions taken on affirmation and, if
not, whether the provisions of article XI may be supplemented by reference to
s. 16  of the Extradition Act . For convenience of assessment of
these matters, I reproduce again the aforesaid article XI and s. 16 , which
are as follows:

ARTICLE
XI.

In the examinations to be made in
conformity with the preceding stipulations, the authorities of the State to
which the demand is addressed shall admit, as entirely valid evidence, the
documents and depositions taken on oath in the other State, or copies of them,
and likewise the warrants and sentences issued there; provided that such documents
are signed or certified by a Judge, Magistrate, or Officer of such State, and
are authenticated by the oath of some witness, or stamped with the official
seal of the Department of Justice or some other Department of State.

…

16.
Depositions or statements taken in a foreign state on oath, or on affirmation,
where affirmation is allowed by the law of the state, and copies of such
depositions or statements and foreign certificates of, or judicial documents
stating the fact of conviction, may, if duly authenticated, be received in
evidence in proceedings under this Part.

The second question is whether there is a
paramount public policy or other limitation in Canadian law which would
preclude acceptance of the depositions proffered in this case if they were otherwise
admissible.

In my opinion, even if it be the case that
article XI of the Extradition Treaty must, in literal compliance with
its terms, be limited to depositions taken on oath, I would not regard it as
inconsistent to supplement article XI by the provisions of s. 16  of the Extradition
Act  which provides for deposi-

[Page 334]

tions taken in a foreign state to be either on
oath or on affirmation where affirmation is there allowed. This does not
advance the matter when there is no express provision for affirmations as there
is none for sworn depositions under Italian law in proceedings before a juge
d’instruction. It remains to consider whether what occurred here may be
regarded as an equivalent in applying considerations of comity.

I come in this respect to the recent judgment of
the English Queen’s Bench Division in R. v. Governor of Pentonville Prison,
ex parte Singh, supra. It involved habeas corpus challenging a
warrant of committal for the extradition of the applicant Singh to Norway where he was wanted in respect of
various drug offences. The Extradition Treaty between Great Britain and Norway was also concluded in 1873 and includes article X which is in terms
similar to article XI of the Treaty with Italy involved here. Both Ackner L.J. and Skinner J. who heard the
application were of the opinion that the words “sworn depositions or statements
of witnesses” should be construed as extending to affirmations. They so held on
the basis of giving an extradition treaty a liberal construction and, to a degree,
on the basis of the course of English legislation which recognized affirmations
although not brought directly into the Treaty. After the Treaty was signed on
June 26, 1873 but prior to an implementing Order in Council on September 13, 1873, the Extradition Act, 1873 was
passed on August 5, 1873 and it provided as follows in s. 4:

…the provisions of the principal Act
relating to depositions and statements on oath taken in a foreign state, and
copies of such original depositions and statements, do and shall extend to
affirmations taken in a foreign state, and copies of such affirmations.

The critical question then became whether the
depositions taken from witnesses in Norway involved affirmations. Section 168 of the Norwegian Penal Code provided
a penalty of imprison-

[Page 335]

ment for giving false testimony before a Court,
the prosecution or other public authority. The Norwegian Penal Code also
forbade the taking of an oath by persons who, inter alia, were under
suspicion of guilt of the act which is the subject of investigation. Here the
depositions were by accomplices, and hence they could not be sworn. However,
they accepted that the statements that they had made were accurate; the
statements were dictated into the court record by the judges and they were
signed by the witnesses. Three of the witnesses later stated that they were
aware of the penal consequences if false testimony was given and the fourth
said that he did not know of the penal provision when he gave his evidence but
said it would have been the same even if he had known of it and he repeated
that he had told the truth.

Both judges in the Singh case held the
depositions to be admissible as affirmations. Ackner L.J. said this (at
p. 27):

…it is agreed that the mere signature to a
document or the verbal acknowledgment that its contents are correct cannot
amount to an affirmation. Where then is the line to be drawn?

The answer cannot be precise: it must be a
matter of fact and degree dependent on the particular circumstances of the
case. I do not consider that the affirmation need take place prior to the
making of the statement. What is required, where the statement has been made,
is its adoption in circumstances which recognise the gravity and importance of
the truth being told on the particular occasion. I would not necessarily accept
that the mere acknowledgment, albeit before a judicial authority, that what has
been previously said is the truth would amount to an affirmation. But in this
case the acknowledgment before the judicial authority was made after the terms
or the substance of s 168 of the Norwegian Penal Code was drawn to the
attention of each of the alleged accomplices. The fact that the provisions of
this section were not drawn to their attention initially when they appeared
before the judge does not seem to me, in the circumstances of this case, to
make any material difference. They were brought back before the court within a
very short time of their initial appearance and their subsequent acknowledgment
in the circumstances which I have described of the truth of what they had
previously said amounted, in my judgment, to a sufficient acknowledgment.

[Page 336]

I am of the opinion that this Court should take
the same liberal view here with respect to the depositions of Lepri and Cipullo.
Each was warned of his duty to tell the truth and each was aware of penal
consequences if he did not. Each signed his deposition which was duly
authenticated by a juge d’instruction. However, those considerations do
not apply to Conforto. The consequences, not penal, in her case were merely
that her evidence might be acted on by the trial judge to convict the accused;
she herself was in no jeopardy and she had not accepted any obligation to tell
the truth. In my opinion, therefore, her deposition was not admissible before
the Extradition Judge.

Counsel for the respondent Piperno relied on R.
v. Governor of Pentonville Prison, ex parte Kirby, [1979] 2 All E.R. 1094.
That case had to do with the contents of the evidence brought by way of
deposition before the Extradition Judge and with its consequent admissibility.
It was inadmissible because under the English Fugitive Offenders Act 1967
it did not satisfy admissibility under English rules of evidence which applied
to extradition proceedings. The Kirby case is of no assistance here nor
is the judgment of the House of Lords in Government of Australia v. Harrod,
[1975] 1 W.L.R. (U.K.) 745,
which dealt with matters not involved in the present proceeding.

For the foregoing reasons, it is my opinion that
the Lepri and Cipullo depositions are admissible but not that of Conforto.

I would, however, dismiss the appeal on the
ground that mandamus does not lie. The respondent is entitled to costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Two convictions for same
act—Whether second conviction proper—Whether the Quon case continues to
govern—Whether s. 21 applicable to a charge under s. 83—Criminal Code, R.S.C
1970, c. C-34 as amended ss. 21, 83.

Appellant and two co-accused pleaded guilty
to a charge of attempted robbery while armed with an offensive weapon and not
guilty to a charge of use of a firearm while attempting to commit robbery. They
were acquitted on the second charge by a Provincial Court Judge on the basis of
the Kienapple case forbidding multiple convictions for the same matter.
On an appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal of Ontario reversed the verdict of acquittal.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Ritchie J. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Dickson, Estey, Mclntyre and Chouinard JJ.: Section 21 of the Code with
respect to parties to an offence applies to s. 83; the appellant, who did not actually
use the firearm himself, could be found guilty of an offence under s. 83. By
enacting s. 83—a section materially different from the earlier s.
122—Parliament departed from the fundamental common law principle, found in Kienapple,
that no one should be punished twice for the same matter. Section 83
formed part of a comprehensive scheme of gun control legislation. In
section 83 Parliament created a distinct offence and provided in
unambiguous language that a sentence under it be served consecutively to any
other punishment imposed for another offence arising out of the same event. To
construe the section as inapplicable where a firearm was used during a
robbery would largely defeat Parliament’s clear intention to punish more
severely those who make use of firearms during the commission of offences.

[Page 285]

Per Laskin
C.J. and Ritchie J., dissenting in part: Unless Parliament gives a clear
indication that multiple prosecutions and multiple convictions are envisaged,
the common law principle expressed in Kienapple should be followed. The
formulation of s. 83 did not justify a departure from the principle and from
what this Court decided in Quon where the words “any criminal offence”
in s. 122 had not been extended to cover criminal offences of which an
essential element was “possession of a firearm capable of being concealed upon
the person”. Section 83 is not that different from former s. 122 in making
it an indictable offence “to use a firearm while committing or attempting to
commit an indictable offence”. The restrictive interpretation given in Quon should
be applied here and the conviction under s. 83 quashed.

The reasons of Laskin C.J. and Ritchie J. were
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting in part)—This
appeal, which is here as of right, concerns a number of issues raised by the
appellant in respect of Criminal Code , s. 83  following his conviction
thereunder by the Ontario Court of Appeal which set aside his acquittal at
trial.

The appellant accused and two co-accused pleaded
guilty to a charge of attempted robbery

[Page 286]

(an attempt to steal money while armed with an
offensive weapon, a twelve-gauge shot-gun). They were subsequently arraigned on
a charge of using a firearm (the same twelve-gauge shot-gun) while attempting
to commit an indictable offence, the attempted robbery to which they pleaded
guilty. To this second charge, brought under Criminal Code , s. 83(1) (a)
they pleaded not guilty. Evidence was called on that charge but the accused
did not testify. He was acquitted by the Provincial Court Judge mainly on the
basis of the Kienapple case, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, forbidding multiple
convictions for the same matter or delict. The Ontario Court of Appeal,
following its own previous judgment in R. v. Langevin (1979), 47 C.C.C.
(2d) 138 (which had not been decided when the Provincial Court Judge acquitted
here) held that Kienapple was not a bar to a conviction under s. 83(1) (a)
following the conviction of attempted robbery and it held, further, that on
the evidence a conviction should be entered under that provision.

In this Court, counsel for the appellant took
three points which it will be convenient to set out in the following order
although argued differently. He contended, first, that the accused could not be
convicted under s. 83(1) (a) when, at the worst, he was implicated with
his co-accused as driver of their get-away car and he himself did not use any
firearm. The contention was that a person could not be convicted under s.
83(1) (a) unless he himself used a firearm while committing or attempting
to commit an indictable offence; in short, a conviction was not open under s.
83(1) (a) by invocation of Criminal Code , s. 21 . Secondly, counsel
submitted that even if s. 21  applied to an offence charged under s. 83(1) (a),
the Ontario Court of Appeal was wrong to find that the appellant was a party
here to the use of a firearm. The third submission was that the Kienapple
principle was properly applicable in respect of the charge under s. 83(1) (a)
because this provision, although brought into force in 1978 as enacted by
1976-77 (Can.), c. 53, s. 3, was substantially the same as its forerun-

[Page 287]

ner which was in force as s. 122 when R. v.
Quon, [1948] S.C.R. 508 was decided. In that case a charge under s. 122,
following a plea of guilty to robbery, was quashed by the Ontario Court of
Appeal and this holding was sustained in this Court.

The relevant statutory provisions on the three
points taken by counsel for the appellant are as follows:

83. (1)
Every one who uses a firearm

(a) while committing or
attempting to commit an indictable offence, or

(b) during his flight after
committing or attempting to commit an indictable offence,

whether or not he causes or means to cause
bodily harm to any person as a result thereof, is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment

(c) in the case of a first offence under
this subsection, except as provided in paragraph (d), for not
more than fourteen years and not less than one year; and

(d) in the case of a second
or subsequent offence under this subsection, or in the case of a first such
offence committed by a person who, prior to the coming into force of this
subsection, was convicted of an indictable offence or an attempt to commit an
indictable offence, in the course of which or during his flight after the
commission or attempted commission of which he used a firearm, for not more than
fourteen years and not less than three years.

(2) A sentence imposed on a person for an
offence under subsection (1) shall be served consecutively to any other
punishment imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same event or
series of events and to any other sentence to which he is subject at the time
the sentence is imposed on him for an offence under subsection (1).

…

21. (1)
Every one is a party to an offence who

(a) actually commits it,

(b) does or omits to do
anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it, or

(c) abets any person in committing
it.

[Page 288]

(2) Where two or more persons form an
intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other
therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an
offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of
the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose
is a party to that offence.

I shall deal with the history of s. 83  when I
come to consider the submission on the application of the Kienapple case.

Turning to the first point taken on behalf of
the accused, it proves too much. If valid, it would nullify large
sections of the Criminal Code  in respect of persons charged as
parties under s. 21 . To take one striking illustration, it would preclude
a conviction of a party under s. 21 of murder under s. 213 (d), which
uses words similar to those found in s. 83(1) (a). The main reliance on
behalf of the appellant for the contention that only a person who himself uses
a firearm may be found culpable under s. 83(1) (a) is the judgment of
this Court in Paquette v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 189. That case was
examined and distinguished in the associated case of Nicholson v. The Queen,
[1981] 2 S.C.R. 600, heard in this Court immediately after the present
case. It was pointed out there that Paquette does not have the general
effect contended for but rather has a special and limited force.
Section 21  is itself general and not special, and in its generality is
applicable to all criminal offences so as to bring parties thereunder within
the scope of criminal responsibility. It is only when the application of s. 21 
is either expressly or by necessary construction excluded in respect of an
offence or a defence to an offence (as this Court stated in Paquette in
respect of Criminal Code , s. 17 ) that the submission made here can
prevail. That is not this case and, consequently, the Court of Appeal correctly
held that the accused could be culpable under s. 83(1) (a) through
s. 21 .

[Page 289]

In contending, on his second point, that the
Court of Appeal wrongly found that the accused was a party to the offence
charged under s. 83(1) (a), his counsel submitted also that there was no
evidence that the accused was a party. At the most, so the contention went, the
accused was an accessory after the fact and outside of s. 21 . The issues raised
by counsel under his second point engage the proceedings before the trial judge
and I wish to refer to them.

After the accused and his co-accused pleaded
guilty to attempted robbery and after their arraignment on the s. 83(1) (a)
charge, but before any evidence was called on that charge, Crown counsel
purported to read in an agreed statement of facts on the attempted robbery.
When the trial judge told him to read in just the facts to substantiate the
plea of guilty, Crown counsel said “They’re both intertwined. I’m in agreement
to read in the facts. There’s no problems [sic] there, but as long as My
Friends feel that it’s not going to prejudice their defence…” Counsel for the
appellant here then said “I don’t think there’s too much problem. We
substantially agree to certain facts on the guilty plea…” Various facts were
then recited by Crown counsel, the concluding statement being “And the person
who was driving the car, in which they were able to escape from the scene, was
Mr. McGuigan”. The latter’s counsel agreed that the facts were correct.

Before Crown counsel read in the facts and
before appellant’s counsel said “I don’t think there’s too much problem” and so
on, the trial judge said this:

Well I’m not going to take those facts into
consideration on a plea of not guilty. I mean they haven’t admitted anything on
a plea of not guilty, except that they’re here.

After the facts were read in, the trial judge
said “On the basis of the information provided by the Crown Attorney, and to
the extent to which that is acknowledged by the Pros-[sic] by the
Defence

[Page 290]

Counsel, there will be a conviction of each of
you on this charge [of attempted robbery].” Thereupon, the Crown called
evidence on the second charge, that under s. 83(1) (a).

Judgment was reserved at the conclusion of the
evidence, and in the course of his reasons the trial judge said that “The
circumstances of the case [that is the s. 83(1) (a) charge], I don’t
think I need to go into them in great detail as a result of the plea of guilty
but are…” and thereupon he repeated substantially what the Crown Attorney had
recited. Having said this he turned to the defence which was based on Kienapple,
and without more acquitted the accused.

The Court of Appeal made no reference to the
course of the proceedings to which I have referred but, having concluded that
s. 21  was applicable to a charge under s. 83(1) (a), it said this [at p.
310]:

We are all of the view that it was open to
the trial Judge to conclude that these accused entered into a common purpose to
commit the offence of armed robbery and that each of them knew or ought to have
known that the use of a firearm was a probable consequence of the carrying out
of that unlawful purpose. This was not a case where the firearm in question was
a small hand-gun capable of being concealed upon the person of one of the
accused in circumstances where the others might not know that he was in possession
of a gun. Here, the firearm was a shot-gun belonging to one of the accused,
carried by another accused and transported in a car driven by the third accused
and in which shot-gun shells were found. Not only do we think it was open to
the trial Judge to draw a conclusion that each of the accused had entered into
a common purpose to rob and that each knew or ought to have known that the use
of the gun was a probable consequence of carrying out the robbery, but we think
it was not open to him on the facts proved or admitted to come to any other
conclusion.

The question is whether there was reversible
error in the proceedings before the trial judge, error not cured by the
different position taken by the Court of Appeal. Counsel for the appellant
asserted, and did so emphatically, that he was not seeking a new trial but
rather acquittal, or, I

[Page 291]

would add, acquittal or nothing. In my opinion,
if there was non-curable error, I would not agree that an acquittal must
result, unless the trial judge was correct in applying Kienapple. If
not, the proper order would be to direct a new trial in respect of the
appellant.

There is no doubt that an agreed statement of
facts referable to a particular charge is not admissible in a subsequent trial
unless it can be said to amount to an admission accepted by counsel for the
accused as applicable to the subsequent trial: Cf. R. v. Falconer and Mann, [1970]
4 C.C.C. 362. In the present case, the transcript suggests that the facts
recited were accepted as an admission and that the trial judge and, indeed, the
Court of Appeal treated them in that way. This despite the trial judge’s
initial assertion that he was not going to take them into consideration on the
s. 83(1) (a) charge. The Court of Appeal, in the concluding sentence
quoted from its reasons set out above, referred to “the facts proved or
admitted”. It is difficult in these circumstances, having regard, moreover, to
the wide powers of the Court of Appeal in reviewing the propriety of an
acquittal, to say that it could not properly assess the evidence in the terms
recited above. Counsel for the accused conceded in his factum that “if the
Court of Appeal… was correct in holding that it was open to the learned Trial
Judge to look to the admitted facts on the guilty plea to attempted armed
robbery, then there was some evidence” to support the conviction of the
appellant as a party to the offence under s. 83(1) (a). There would,
accordingly, not be a strict question of law to support an appeal.

The Court of Appeal was entitled to proceed on
the facts proved, failing any finding on the facts by the trial judge. In
founding itself on “the facts proved or admitted”, the Court of Appeal
indicated in effect that there was no substantial difference. I do not think,
therefore, that it can be said that the Court of Appeal utilized inadmissible

evidence. Its powers under Criminal Code , s.
613(4) (b)(ii) are in themselves ample enough to support its view of the
evidence so as to raise in this Court only a question of sufficiency.

Of course, this Court is entitled to determine
for itself whether there was any evidence to support a conviction, especially
when in this case there was no express or clear finding on the evidence by the
trial judge. However, in the absence of any countering evidence by the
appellant, I do not think that a finding of no evidence would be justified. I
would not, therefore, interfere with the view taken by the Court of Appeal
adverse to the appellant.

I turn, finally, to the ground of appeal founded
on the Kienapple case. This Court, in applying in that case a rule
against multiple convictions for the same matter or delict, pointed out that it
was open to Parliament to avoid the rule by prescribing multiple convictions as
it might see fit. The Court made the following pronouncement in that connection
(at p. 753):

Parliament’s power to constitute two
separate offences out of the same matter is not in question, but unless there
is a clear indication that multiple prosecutions and, indeed, multiple
convictions are envisaged, the common law principle expressed in the Cox and
Paton case should be followed. Neither the definitions of the respective
offences nor their history gives any support to the view that that common law
principle has been ousted. The limits of punishment are the same, and I have
already spoken of the ingredients of the respective offences.

In R. v. Langevin, supra, the Ontario
Court of Appeal concluded that the present formulation of s. 83 , taken as a
whole, justified a departure from the Kienapple principle on the facts
of that case and supported a different result from that reached by this Court
in the Quon case under what was then s. 122  of the Criminal Code . The
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R.
v. Eby (1979), 49 C.C.C. (2d) 27, the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Matheson (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 92
and the Quebec Court of Appeal
in R. v. Pineault; R. v.

[Page 293]

Bérubê (1979), 12
C.R. (3d) 129 all reached the result that the Ontario Court of Appeal reached
in Langevin. Even a little earlier, Kienapple was held
inapplicable in the light of the terms of s. 83  in R. v. Desrosiers (1978),
47 C.C.C. (2d) 253, a judgment of the Quebec Sessions of the Peace.

What must be determined here is whether s. 83 
has indeed the effect on the facts of this case that the Ontario Court of
Appeal found, on the basis of the facts in Langevin, that it had there
and, consequently, in the present case. Did Langevin and does this case
justify a departure from the Kienapple principle and, more particularly,
from what this Court decided earlier in R. v. Quon?

Weapons offences have a long history in Canadian
criminal law. The Criminal Code  of 1892 included two provisions found
earlier in R.S.C. 1886, c. 149, s. 4 and c. 148, s. 2. They were, respectively,
ss. 102 and 107, reading as follows:

102. Every
one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to five years’ imprisonment
who has in his custody or possession, or carries, any offensive weapons for any
purpose dangerous to the public peace.

…

107. Every
one who when arrested, either on a warrant issued against him for an offence or
while committing an offence, has upon his person a pistol or air-gun is guilty
of an offence and liable, on summary conviction before two justices of the
peace, to a penalty not exceeding fifty dollars and not less than twenty
dollars, or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months, with or
without hard labour.

These sections were carried forward in the Criminal
Code , in the R.S.C. 1906, c. 146 (as ss. 115 and 120) and, again, in
the Criminal Code  as it appeared in R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, as ss. 115
and 120.

These provisions were revised by 1932-33 (Can.), c. 25 and became ss. 122 and 123,
which were in the following terms:

122. Every
one who has upon his person a pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being
concealed on

[Page 294]

the person while committing any criminal
offence of which he is convicted, shall receive a sentence of two years in
addition to the sentence imposed in respect of the offence aforesaid of which
he is convicted.

123. Every
one who has upon his person any offensive weapon, with intent therewith
unlawfully to do injury to any other person, is guilty of an offence and
liable, on summary conviction before two justices, to a penalty not exceeding
two hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars, or to imprisonment for any
term not exceeding six months, with or without hard labour.

A minor amendment was made to s. 122  by 1938 (Can.), c. 44, s. 7 so as to make the
provision read as follows:

122. (1)
Every one who has upon his person a rifle, shot-gun, pistol, revolver or any
firearm capable of being concealed upon the person while committing any
criminal offence is guilty of an offence against this section and liable
to imprisonment for a term not less than two years in addition to any penalty
to which he may be sentenced for the first mentioned offence, and an offence
against this section shall be punishable either on indictment or summary
conviction in the same manner as the first mentioned offence.

(2) Such imprisonment shall be served after
undergoing any term of imprisonment to which such person may be sentenced for
the first mentioned offence.

It was this provision that was considered in the
Quon case.

In the Quon case the accused, armed with
a revolver, committed a robbery to which he pleaded guilty. He was also charged
with having on his person a revolver contrary to s. 122 . He was sentenced to a
two-year term for the robbery and to a further two years under s. 122 . The only
material change to s. 122 , effected in 1938, was the addition of the words
“rifle” and “shot-gun” to the list of weapons and a re-arrangement of the
penalty provisions. In upholding the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal
quashing the conviction under s. 122 , this Court adverted first to the Court of
Appeal’s view that the words “any criminal offence” in s. 122  could, if viewed
as exhaustive, encompass every offence under the Criminal Code . The
Ontario Court of Appeal felt that this would give too broad a scope to s. 122 
and that its

[Page 295]

reference to having a revolver or any firearm
while committing any criminal offence should not be extended to cover a
criminal offence of which an essential element was possession of a revolver or
any firearm capable of being concealed upon the person (to use the exact words
of s. 122 ). The Ontario Court of Appeal had also pointed to what was referred
to in Quon as absurdities or inconsistencies arising from other
provisions of the Criminal Code , such as s. 118  which made a person
liable to imprisonment for up to five years if, not having a prescribed permit,
he has upon his person, elsewhere than in his dwelling house or shop, a pistol,
revolver or other firearm capable of being concealed upon his person. Again, s.
457(2), as it then stood, provided for a conviction of a person who, when
arrested for or when committing burglary, had upon his person any offensive
weapon—and he was liable to whipping in addition to imprisonment on conviction
of burglary.

Estey J., speaking for himself and Rinfret C.J.C.,
after reviewing various provisions of the Criminal Code , was prompted to
say this (at p. 511):

The construction given to this
section [s. 122 ] by the learned Judges of the Appellate Court avoids these
absurdities and repugnancies. Moreover, that construction seems to be supported
by a perusal of many sections of the Code. The group of
sections such as 115 to 129 deal in the main with custody and possession
of the specified weapons under certain circumstances; then the offences such as
sec. 264 (attempts murder); sec. 273 (wounding with intent);
sec. 446 (robbery) cover those cases in which the weapons are used in the
manner as therein described. In all of these latter offences the maximum
punishment provided is life imprisonment. In those sections where
possession or custody is the basis of the offence, Parliament has in mind the
mischief of risk to the public occasioned by the possession of one of these
firearms. Apart from 122 there is no section that deals with the having,
with or without a permit, the firearms specified in 122 upon the person of one
while committing a criminal offence. A firearm upon the person of a criminal
while committing an offence is fraught with the

[Page 296]

greatest possible danger to the public,
when detected, he resorts to his firearm with usually serious and sometimes
fatal consequences to one or more of the public. It is in sec. 122 , as in
the other sections with which it is associated under the heading
“Offensive Weapons”, that Parliament seeks to punish and to that extent to
protect the public against the possession or custody of these firearms and
thereby avoid the consequences already suggested.

Kellock J., with whom Taschereau J. in effect
agreed, spoke in the same vein. He too rejected the literal interpretation of the
phrase “any criminal offence” in s. 122 . He said this in reference to
associated offences (at pp. 524-25):

In my opinion it would be absurd to say
that a person liable to conviction under the provisions of subsection 2
[of s. 457] is also liable to be convicted under the provisions of
section 122 , if the offensive weapon is a firearm. The absurdity of such a
construction is heightened by the fact that the penalty provided by
section 457, subsection 1, is imprisonment for life.

Coming to section 446(c) [robbery],
Parliament has by this provision, declared that for that offence, involving as
one of its main elements, the presence on the offender of an offensive weapon,
the penalty may be imprisonment for life and whipping. That is expressly the
penalty for the totality of that conduct. I do not think therefore, that there
is to be attributed to Parliament the intention that one part of that conduct
(where the weapon in question is a firearm) may be made the subject of a
separate charge under section 122 , a procedure which would be ineffective
and absurd where the maximum penalty had been imposed. In any case where the
maximum is not imposed, it is to be taken that it is because the trial tribunal
did not consider that the conduct involved merited such a penalty. Surely it
cannot be said that in such a case Parliament has expressed the intention,
nonetheless, that the same tribunal may be called upon to impose an additional
penalty for the same conduct under the guise of a separate charge. While it is
the fact that in the case of the offences provided for by clauses (a)
and (b) of section 446, the penalty is the same as in the case of
an offence under clause (c), an offensive weapon is not there in either
case involved. The same considerations therefore do not apply as in a case
under clause (c).

It is quite true that under the provisions
of section 122 , subsection 1 , a conviction for the offence thereby

[Page 297]

provided does not depend upon a conviction
for the other offence to which the subsection refers but it does depend
upon such offence being proved to have been in fact committed. I do not think,
therefore, that this situation has any bearing upon the construction of the
section from the standpoint above set forth.

Although the approach of the Court in the Quon
case was on the basis of construction of s. 122 , it nonetheless
followed, once the words “any criminal offence’’ were given a restricted
meaning, that the Court applied a rule against multiple convictions for the
same matter or delict. Kerwin J., who alone dissented, saw no reason to cut
down the scope of the words “any criminal offence”. However, adverting to the
view of the Ontario Court of Appeal that its quashing of the conviction did not
rest on res judicata or, rather, that it did not consider that defence,
he concluded that, if that be so, the case should be remitted to that Court to
pass upon the defence. However, if the Ontario Court of Appeal had decided the
point against the accused, the appeal should be dismissed. I shall return to
the Quon case later in these reasons.

The Criminal Code  was amended in 1951 by
the repeal of former s. 122  and the substitution by 1951 (Can.), c. 47 of s. 115, which was similar
to s. 102  in the Code of 1892. The new s. 115  was as follows:

115. Every
one who carries or has in his custody or possession an offensive weapon for a
purpose dangerous to the public peace is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to imprisonment for five years.

A revision by way of extension of this provision
occurred in R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 83 which was in these words:

83. Every
one who carries or has in his possession a weapon or imitation thereof, for a
purpose dangerous to the public peace or for the purpose of committing an
offence, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for five
years.

So the situation remained until the present s.
83 was enacted by 1976-77 (Can.),
c. 53, s. 3. It resembles the former s. 122 , which was in force

[Page 298]

from 1934 to 1951 (with some changes in 1938),
and as already noted, was the provision that, subject to the changes in 1938,
was considered in the Quon case. What then were the differences between Quon
and Langevin that produced in the latter case a departure from the
former? I do not think that any difference can turn on the restricted meaning
given to the words “any criminal offence” in former s. 122 , considered in the Quon
case. The question of principle raised here must be assessed on the basis
that the words “any criminal offence” do not include an offence of which an
essential element is the possession upon the person of a revolver or any
firearm capable of being concealed upon the person. Put another way, this Court
has said in Quon that the Crown is not entitled to vex an accused, to
subject him to prosecution, coming and going, so to speak; that is, to
prosecute him for robbery while armed with a revolver and to prosecute him also
for having that revolver while committing the robbery. These are, in short,
obverse faces of the same coin.

Section 83 is not that different from
former s. 122  in making it an indictable offence to use a firearm while
committing or attempting to commit an indictable offence. The last mentioned
words (“while committing… an indictable offence”) do not appear to me to differ
in substance from the words in former s. 122 , “while committing any criminal
offence”. There is, however, a difference in the introduction of the offence in
former s. 122  and the present s. 83(1) (a). Section 122  introduced
the offence thereunder with the words “Every one who has upon his person a
rifle, shot-gun, pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed
upon the person”, while s. 83(1) (a) uses the simpler expression “Every
one who uses a firearm”. In Quon, the robbery charge under the then s.
446(c) was defined as “being armed with an offensive weapon or instrument robs…
any person”. The weapon of the accused Quon, with which he was armed, was a
pistol or revolver. In Langevin, robbery under the present s. 302(d)
is defined as stealing from a person while armed with an offensive weapon. In
that case, the

[Page 299]

weapon was particularized as a rifle which, of
course, like a pistol or revolver, is a firearm.

So far, it does not appear that on the facts of Quon
and Langevin there is any material difference between them. In each
case, the robbery had to involve and did involve an offensive weapon. The
pistol or revolver brandished by the robber in the Quon case to
intimidate the victim, was clearly in his possession within the then s. 122 ;
and it could be said that it was “used”, if that expression had then been in s.
122 . “Use” was, of course, the basis of the s. 83(1) (a) conviction in Langevin
and also in the present case. Of course, if in the Langevin case or
in the present case the accused had committed a robbery while in possession of
an offensive weapon, but without using the weapon (and I postulate a
distinction between possession and use), then he could not in any event have
been charged under s. 83(1) (a).

Where then did the Ontario Court of Appeal in Langevin
find the distinction from Quon? Martin J.A. who spoke for that Court
in Langevin, approached the matter from the standpoint of an assumption
that Parliament was aware of the existing state of the law when it enacted the
present s. 83, and hence aware of the rule against multiple convictions for the
same matter or delict. I do not see where such an assumption leads if the
legislation to which it is directed does not plainly support it. The citation
by Martin J.A. of civil cases to sustain what is in truth a fiction should have
a no bearing on the proper construction of the criminal law. It is as fully a
cogent principle that an accused is not liable to conviction unless clearly
caught by the statute under which he is charged as is the assumption invoked by
Martin J.A. in Langevin. The same restrictive interpretation (compatible
with the principle just mentioned) that was given in Quon was equally
open in Langevin.

[Page 300]

The learned Justice of Appeal drew a distinction
between possession as an element under former s. 122  and use as the element
under the present s. 83(1) (a), offensive weapons, which were firearms,
being involved in either case. I can see no basis for such a differentiation
when the possession or use, as the case may be, is geared to the commission of
a criminal offence in the one case and the commission of an indictable offence
(which is a criminal offence) in the other. Nor am I as certain as was Martin
J.A. in Langevin that Parliament had shown its clear intention to make
use of firearms in the commission of an offence culpable in its own right and
expressed it in language which reflected that intention. Again, there is
fiction involved in speaking of the intention of Parliament, especially in
criminal matters, unless it is manifested not by an a priori assumption
but by express language.

The Court of Appeal agreed that Langevin was
not of unlimited scope. The following passage from the reasons of Martin J.A.,
at p. 145, points to some limitations:

Mr. Hunt [for the Crown] conceded during
argument that it would not be reasonable to interpret s. 83 as applying to
offences which by their definitions in the Code require the use of a
firearm as a constituent of the offence, for example, pointing a firearm at
another (s. 84(1) (rep. & sub. idem)) and discharging a
firearm with intent to wound (s. 228). It is also obvious that questions may
arise as to the nature and purpose of the use of a firearm required to render
s. 83 applicable. To illustrate: it would not, I think, be sensible to conclude
that a person in possession of a firearm falling within the definition of a
restricted weapon for which he did not have a registration certificate and,
hence, guilty of an indictable offence under s. 89(1) (rep. & sub. idem) of
the Code, would also be liable to conviction under s. 83(1)  if, while
committing the s. 89(1) offence, he used the firearm for target practice. The
scope of s. 83(1) , and whether it may successfully be invoked in particular
circumstances, must be determined as those circumstances arise, but I am
satisfied that it is properly invoked in the present case notwithstanding the
respondent is charged with theft while “armed” with a firearm.

[Page 301]

Unless I mistake the meaning of this passage, it
appears to me to concede that if in the particular circumstances of a robbery
an accused has in fact used a firearm, he would be within the exclusionary
interpretation of s. 83 accepted by counsel for the Crown in Langevin. True,
he may be charged, in the formal language of s. 302(d) with stealing
while armed with an offensive weapon, but if the circumstances show that he
used the weapon it would be the height of technicality or formalism to say that
he also renders himself separately liable to conviction under s. 83(1) (a).
It is worth repeating that I speak here of offences which involve firearms as
essential elements. The statement of an offence in the terms of the Criminal
Code  cannot be dissociated from the circumstances affecting the accused or
his conduct so as to expose him to an additional liability for that conduct
unless the additional liability is clearly assigned.

In short, I am not persuaded by what has so far
gone before that if Parliament had the intention ascribed to it, that intention
was carried out in the kind of language required to establish culpability in a
criminal matter. To hold a person guilty under s. 83(1) (a) where he has
pleaded or been found guilty of robbery, that is theft while armed with a
firearm, carries no clear distinction for me from a conviction of robbery while
armed with a firearm which the accused brandished resulting in an acquittal in Quon
of being in possession of a firearm while committing robbery.

There remains one important point raised by the
Crown in respect of s. 83 which Martin J.A. mentioned but did not emphasize. It
was put as follows (at p. 144):

Mr. Hunt, in support of his contention
that Parliament has shown a clear intention to exclude the rule against
multiple convictions in respect of the same delict, relied upon the language of
s. 83(2) which pro-

[Page 302]

vides that “a sentence imposed on a person
for an offence under subsection (1) shall be served consecutively to
any other punishment imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same
event or series of events…”.

There is, of course, no reason to deny the
effect of a penalty provision as establishing or fortifying a departure from
the rule against multiple convictions for the same matter or delict. The
situation in respect of penalty, however, appears to me to be indistinguishable
as between Quon and Langevin and the present case.
Section 122 , in force when Quon was decided, provided for a penalty
in addition to that imposed for the primary offence, in that case as this,
robbery, and also for serving the additional penalty consecutively.
Section 83(2), dealing with penalty, also provides for consecutive
punishment but concludes it is to be consecutive “to any other punishment
imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same event or series of
events”. It is to be observed that s. 83(2) does not speak of the same matter
or delict. It refers rather to a happening or happenings and thus to
occurrences which may not arise from the same matter or delict. I cannot agree
that the penalty provisions of s. 83(2) achieve what the substantive definition
of the offence in s. 83(1) (a) did not.

The argument based on penalty would have great
cogency if it were the fact that s. 83 was limited in subject matter to the
offences in Langevin and in the present case. That, however, is not so.
As was pointed out in Langevin it applies to other offences in which, it
was conceded by the Crown, the rule against multiple convictions still
operated. So much then for the force of the penalty provision, and its lack of
force in the instances specified was probably the reason why Martin J.A. did
not emphasize it.

But beyond this, there are other offences in
which a firearm may be used which could carry a second conviction by reason of
such use without attracting the multiple conviction rule; for example, the use
of a firearm in connection with a rape.

[Page 303]

There would be no connection then between the
principal offence and use of the firearm, as there is in robbery in which being
armed with a firearm is an ingredient of the offence. Another illustration lies
in the offence of breaking and entering. Here, again, if a firearm is used,
there is adequate ground to charge its use as a separate offence not excluded
by the rule against multiple convictions. Other illustrations lie in the
definition of robbery in s. 302(a),(b) and (c) where being
armed with an offensive weapon is not a required element of the offences.
Again, being unlawfully in a dwelling house, contrary to s. 307(1) is an
offence which may involve use of a firearm but it is not an element of the
offence. Other examples abound in the Code but it is unnecessary to
detail them all. It is enough to say that there is ample subject matter for s.
83(1) (a), ample enough to allow the co-existence of the rule in Quon and
the rule in Kienapple.

For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that Langevin
was wrongly decided and that the appeal in the present case should be
allowed and the conviction under s. 83(1) (a) quashed.

The judgment of Martland, Dickson, Estey,
Mclntyre and Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The appellant, Thomas William
McGuigan, and two other persons, were jointly charged that on or about January
7, 1979, at the Village of Angus in the County of Simcoe, they did unlawfully
attempt to steal a sum of money from Ik-Soo Kim while armed with an offensive
weapon, to wit: a twelve-gauge shot-gun, contrary to s. 302 (d) and s.
421  of the Criminal Code . To that charge the three accused pleaded
guilty. The same three persons were also charged that on the same date and at
the same place they did use a firearm, to wit a twelve-gauge shot-gun, while
attempting to commit robbery, contrary to s. 83 of the Code. To that
charge they pleaded not guilty.

[Page 304]

Crown counsel read a statement of facts on the
charge of attempted robbery, following which a conviction was entered in
respect of that charge against McGuigan and his co-accused. (McGuigan was
sentenced to three years in penitentiary.) The Crown then called as witnesses,
in respect of the second charge, Mr. Ik-Soo Kim, his wife Sundae Tie Kim, three
constables, a firearms examiner, and a Mr. Elliott who identified a
twelve-gauge shot-gun entered as an exhibit and testified that he had given it
to one of the accused, not McGuigan.

The evidence may be sketched briefly.
Mr. Kim operates a variety store in Angus. On the evening in question, he
and his wife and baby were in the store when he heard a noise to the rear of
the store. Investigating, he saw a car with two occupants. He enquired of the
driver what he was doing there and received no response. The car drove away but
Mr. Kim recorded the number of the license plate on a piece of cardboard.
About ten minutes later two men wearing stocking masks entered the store, one
armed with a shot-gun, and demanded money. Mr. Kim grabbed the gun and took
it from the intruder. The gun discharged, pellets striking the ceiling.
Mr. Kim struck one of the men with the gun and chased both men outside to
a waiting car. He hit the front windshield of the car with the gun, damaging
both windshield and gun. The car left and Mr. Kim called the police who
arrived at 10:06 p.m. Twenty-five minutes later a constable in a patrol car saw
a vehicle of the description and bearing the license number noted by
Mr. Kim. The three accused were arrested shortly thereafter. Mr. McGuigan
was the driver of the car. The right front of the windshield was broken. In the
vehicle the police found a box containing nine shot-gun shells. A nylon
stocking was located on the floor behind the passenger side.

Provincial Court Judge Anjo acquitted all three
on the charge of using a firearm while committing an indictable offence. He
held that an essential

[Page 305]

element of the attempted robbery charge to which
they had pleaded guilty, namely, the twelve-gauge shot-gun, was an essential
element of the second count under s. 83 and therefore the principle of Kienapple
v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729 against multiple convictions arising out
of the same delict applied. The Ontario Court of Appeal (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d)
306 reversed on an appeal by the Crown from the acquittal.

The appellant takes three points on this appeal.

First, he says that the Court of Appeal erred in
holding that he was a party to the offence charged. The error alleged arises
from the following paragraph in the reasons for judgment of the Appellate Court
(at p. 310):

Not only do we think it was open to the
trial Judge to draw a conclusion that each of the accused had entered into a
common purpose to rob and that each knew or ought to have known that the use of
the gun was a probable consequence of carrying out the robbery, but we think it
was not open to him on the facts proved or admitted to come to any other
conclusion. [Emphasis added]

It is submitted that the phrase “facts proved or
admitted” indicate that the Court relied upon the admissions of fact made
pursuant to the plea of guilty to the charge of attempted armed robbery. It is
argued that, apart from those admissions, the evidence against the appellant
consisted merely of the fact that he was driving a vehicle some twenty to forty
miles away from the scene of the offence, some one-half hour after the offence
and this vehicle had passengers who were connected to the offence of attempted
armed robbery.

I do not know what the Court of Appeal intended
by the reference to facts admitted. I agree with counsel for the appellant that
in the absence of consent (and there was none) it was not open to the trial
judge to look to the admitted facts on the guilty plea under count one in
determining that the appellant was a party to the weapons offence

[Page 306]

under count two. A careful reading of the
transcript makes it clear, however, that that was not what the trial judge did.
When the time came for Crown counsel to read the statement of facts, the
following exchange took place. Mr. Hermiston was counsel for
Mr. McGuigan.

CROWN: The only problems [sic] that
I can foresee Your Honour, as My Friend says, that would be the argument on
Section eighty-three is a legal argument, rather than an argument on the
factual situation. But I—if I read the facts in, there’s certain aspects of
that fact that are not acceptable to the Accused, then we’re in a position that
I—I may prejudice the not guilty plea.

BY THE COURT: I think if you just read in
sufficient facts to substantiate the plea of guilty?

CROWN: They’re both intertwined. I’m in
agreement to read in the facts. There’s no problems [sic] there,
but as long as My Friends feel that it’s not going to prejudice their defense…

BY THE COURT: Well I’m not going to take
those facts into consideration on a plea of not guilty. I mean they haven’t
admitted anything on a plea of not guilty, except that they’re here.

MR. HERMISTON: I don’t think there’s
too much problem. We substantially agree to certain facts on the guilty plea,
and if there’s certain facts that we don’t agree to, but nevertheless admit our
guilt. There’s no problem, I don’t think.

BY THE COURT: All right. Read—I’d like to
hear the facts on the plea.

CROWN: Your Honour, the facts on the plea
to the robbery, or attempted robbery, indicates that…

At the conclusion of the reading of the
statement, the Court asked the accused to stand up and then continued:

On the basis of the information provided by
the Crown Attorney, and to the extent to which that is acknowledged by the
Pros-[sic] by the Defense Counsel, there will be a conviction of each of
you on this charge.

CROWN: Can we deal with the next trial
matter?

[Page 307]

BY THE COURT: Yes.

CROWN: All right. I’ll call Mr. Kim to
the Witness Box.

Then followed the oral testimony of the seven
witnesses, the evidence of whom I have earlier summarized. Apart from the
statement of facts, there was thus a considerable body of evidence, including
the finding of a nylon mask, shot-gun shells and a broken windshield, which was
available against the appellant on the second charge. The appellant did not
testify.

During argument in this Court, counsel for the
appellant stated he did not wish a new trial for his client; he was asking for
an acquittal or nothing. It was pointed out to him that in the circumstances of
the case there was some evidence against his client. The Court was not faced
with a situation of “no evidence”, therefore no question of law was raised
which might engage the jurisdiction of the Court. Crown counsel was advised
that he did not have to respond to the argument on the first ground of appeal.

The second ground of appeal was phrased in this
manner: Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that the
application of s. 83  of the Criminal Code  of Canada is not limited to
cases in which the person charged with using a firearm during the commission or
attempted commission of an indictable offence, himself uses the firearm while
he is himself committing or attempting to commit the indictable offence?

It is contended that only the person who
actually uses a firearm falls within s. 83 of the Code and that s. 21 
cannot therefore be invoked on a charge under s. 83 . Section 21  of the Criminal
Code  reads:

21. (1)
Every one is a party to an offence who

(a) actually commits it,

(b) does or omits to do anything for
the purpose of aiding any person to commit it, or

(c) abets any person in committing
it.

(2) Where two or more persons form an
intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other
therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an
offence, each of them

[Page 308]

who knew or ought to have known that the
commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the
common purpose is a party to that offence.

The Court of Appeal, speaking through
Mr. Justice Martin, rejected this contention when the point was argued in
that Court. The Court could not find any Parliamentary intention to exclude the
application of s. 21 of the Code to a charge under s. 83  and held that
both ss. 21(1) and (2) are applicable to a charge under s. 83 , if
warranted by the evidence. The reasoning of this Court in Zanini v. The
Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 715 was relied upon. The Court of Appeal concluded (at
p. 310):

We are all of the view that it was open to the
trial Judge to conclude that these accused entered into a common purpose to
commit the offence of armed robbery and that each of them knew or ought to have
known that the use of a firearm was a probable consequence of the carrying out
of that unlawful purpose. This was not a case where the firearm in question was
a small hand-gun capable of being concealed upon the person of one of the
accused in circumstances where the others might not know that he was in
possession of a gun. Here, the firearm was a shot-gun belonging to one of the
accused, carried by another accused and transported in a car driven by the
third accused and in which shot-gun shells were found. Not only do we think it
was open to the trial Judge to draw a conclusion that each of the accused had
entered into a common purpose to rob and that each knew or ought to have known
that the use of the gun was a probable consequence of carrying out the robbery,
but we think it was not open to him on the facts proved or admitted to come to
any other conclusion.

With respect, I agree. The second ground of
appeal cannot be sustained.

I turn then to the final, and weightiest, ground
on which this appeal is brought, namely, that the rule against multiple
convictions enunciated in Kienapple v. The Queen, supra, was a bar to a
conviction for the offence under s. 83 , because the shot-gun mentioned in the
attempted robbery charge is the same shot-gun as is referred to in the firearms
charge under s. 83 of the Code. The ground of appeal is stated thus in
the appellant’s factum: “The Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in law in holding that the learned Provincial
 Court

[Page 309]

Judge erred in holding that the Appellant may
not be convicted of the weapons offence and of attempted armed robbery, where
both offences arise out of the use of a single firearm during a single
transaction.”

It will be recalled that Provincial Court Judge
Anjo gave effect to this submission in acquitting Mr. McGuigan of the
firearms charge. Since the judgment of Provincial Court Judge Anjo, rendered February 27, 1979, four courts of appeal have
reached the opposite conclusion. They have held that the Kienapple principle
has no application: the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Langevin (1979),
47 C.C.C. (2d) 138 (rendered April 18, 1979, Martin, Houlden and Zuber JJ.A.)
and in the present case (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 306 (rendered October 3, 1979,
MacKinnon A.C.J.O., Martin and Morden JJ.A.); the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R.
v. Matheson (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 92 (rendered September 4, 1979, Freedman
C.J.M., Monnin and Hall JJ.A.) and in R. v. Nicholson, [1980] 5 W.W.R.
115 (rendered March 25, 1980, Freedman C.J.M., Monnin and Matas JJ.A.); the
Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division in R. v. Eby (1979), 49
C.C.C. (2d) 27 (rendered July 5, 1979, Hart, Jones and Macdonald JJ.A.); the
Quebec Court of Appeal in R. v. Pineault; R. v. Bérubé (1979), 12
C.R. (3d) 129 (rendered October 29, 1979, Mayrand, Nolan JJ.A. and Roberge J. (ad
hoc)).

At the heart of this appeal is this Court’s
decision in R. v. Quon, [1948] S.C.R. 508 in respect of then s. 122 of
the Code and the question as to whether Quon continues to govern,
notwithstanding the material differences in wording between the former s. 122
and the present s. 83 . Those differences can perhaps best be studied if the two
sections are placed side by side. Former s. 122 and present s. 83  read as
follows:

[Page 310]


 
  
  122. (1)
  Everyone who has upon his person a rifle, shot-gun, pistol, revolver or any
  firearm capable of being concealed upon the person while committing any
  criminal offence is guilty of an offence against this section and liable to
  imprisonment for a term not less than two years in addition to any penalty to
  which he may be sentenced for the first mentioned offence, and an offence
  against this section shall be punishable either on indictment or summary
  conviction in the same manner as the first mentioned offence.
  (2) Such imprisonment shall be served
  after undergoing any term of imprisonment to which such person may be
  sentenced for the first mentioned offence.
  
  
  83. (1)
  Every one who uses a firearm
  (a) while committing or attempting
  to commit an indictable offence, or
  (b) during his flight after
  committing or attempting to commit an indictable offence,
  whether or not he causes or means to cause
  bodily harm to any person as a result thereof, is guilty of an indictable
  offence and is liable to imprisonment
  (c) in the case of a first offence
  under this subsection, except as provided in paragraph (d), for not
  more than fourteen years and not less than one year; and
  (d) in the case of a second or
  subsequent offence under this subsection, or in the case of a first such
  offence committed by a person who, prior to the coming into force of this
  subsection, was convicted of an indictable offence or an attempt to commit an
  indictable offence, in the course of which or during his flight after the
  commission or attempted commission of which he used a firearm, for not more
  than fourteen years and not less than three years.
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  (2) A sentence imposed on a person for an
  offence under subsection (1) shall be served consecutively to any other
  punishment imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same event or
  series of events and to any other sentence to which he is subject at the time
  the sentence is imposed on him for an offence under subsection (1).
  
 


The differences between the two
sections are apparent and material. The robbery section in

[Page 311]

force at the time Quon was decided and
the present section read:


 
  
  446. Every
  one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life
  and to be whipped who
  …
  (c) being armed with an offensive
  weapon or instrument robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person.
  
  
  302. Every
  one commits obbery who
  …
  (d) steals from any person while
  armed with an offensive weapon or imitation thereof
  
 


Again there are differences in the two sections.
The present definition of “firearm” in s. 82(1) is narrow in that, for example,
it excludes a firearm which cannot be fired. It reads:

“firearm” means any barrelled weapon from
which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged and that is capable
of causing serious bodily injury or death to a person, and includes any frame
or receiver of such a barrelled weapon and anything that can be adapted for use
as a firearm;

In Quon the accused had entered a
restaurant armed with a revolver and robbed the proprietor of $75. He pleaded
guilty to an offence contrary to s. 446(c) of the Code, was found
guilty of having on his person a revolver, contrary to s. 122 of the Code, and
was sentenced to a term of two years on each count. The Appellate Court for
Ontario quashed the conviction under the second count on the basis that the
words “any criminal offence” in s. 122 “do not include any criminal offence an
essential element of which is the possession upon the person of the pistol,
revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed upon the person” (R. v.
Quon, [1947] O.R. 856, at p. 859 per Roach J.A.). A Crown appeal to
this Court was dismissed. Justices Estey, Taschereau and Kellock each wrote.
Chief Justice Rinfret agreed with Mr. Justice Estey. Mr. Justice
Kerwin dissented. If I understand the reasoning of the majority correctly, it
proceeded on two main lines. First, the words “any criminal offence” in
s. 122 must be given a narrow meaning, otherwise a person could be charged
under then s. 118 with the criminal offence of having a pistol upon his
person elsewhere than in his dwelling house without a permit,

[Page 312]

and also be charged under s. 122 with having a
pistol while committing a criminal offence. Or, a person might be charged with
possession of an offensive weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace
contrary to then s. 115 and be liable also to conviction for the additional
offence created by s. 122. Section 457(2) provided that anyone convicted
of breaking and entering a dwelling house by night with intent who had upon his
person any offensive weapon when he committed the offence would be liable to be
whipped, in addition to the imprisonment otherwise prescribed. Would he also be
liable to conviction under s. 122? Other sections were referred to, such
as then ss. 116, 117, 123, 124 and 446(c) as giving rise to
“absurdities, inconsistencies or repugnancies” if “any criminal offence” in s.
122 meant “any criminal offence”. The second consideration which seems
to have impelled a majority of this Court to limit s. 122 lay in the fact that
the Code had already provided maximum punishment of life imprisonment
for those particularly serious offences such as attempted murder, wounding with
intent and robbery, in which weapons are an element of the offence in the
manner described in s. 122. A further consideration voiced by one of the judges
was the view that a person should not be punished for a robbery of $75 when armed
with a revolver and then receive an additional punishment because he has on his
person the same revolver which was an element of the first criminal offence.

In R. v. Langevin, supra, followed in the
present case, the Ontario Court of Appeal distinguished Quon. In Langevin
the accused had been convicted of robbery and the single question presented
on a Crown appeal was whether a person who has been convicted of theft while
armed with an offensive weapon, to wit, a rifle, may be convicted of an
additional offence under s. 83(1)(a) of the Code of

[Page 313]

using the same firearm while committing the
indictable offence of robbery. Mr. Justice Martin, delivering the judgment
of the Court, answered the question in the affirmative. I should like to quote
two passages from the judgment (at p. 145):

Notwithstanding that in most cases of
“armed robbery” the offender will have used the weapon, none the less, s.
83(1) , by making the use of a firearm an essential element of the offence created
by the subsection, unlike s. 122 which required only that the offender have a
firearm on his person, imports a further element in addition to those which
suffice to constitute theft while armed with a firearm.

The introduction of the requirement of the
use of the firearm while committing or attempting to commit an indictable
offence also removes some of the absurdities referred to in R. v. Quon,
supra, and to which a literal interpretation of s. 122 led, when applied to
offences involving possession of a firearm.

and later (at p. 146):

It is clear to me that Parliament intended
by s. 83  to repress the use of firearms in the commission of crimes by making
such use an offence in its own right, and one which attracts a minimum sentence
of one year consecutive to that imposed for the offence which such use
accompanies. The use of firearms in the commission of crimes is fraught with
danger and gravely disturbing to the community, and Parliament has sought to
protect the public from the danger and alarm caused by that use by enacting the
present legislation. It is not for the Courts to pass upon either the wisdom or
the necessity for the legislation, but to give effect to the clear intention of
Parliament expressed in language which reflects that intention.

Manifestly, the legislation is directed at
those crimes in which firearms are likely to be used, such as robbery, and not
offences where they are not likely to be used, for example, forgery. To
construe the section as not applicable to the use of a firearm during the
commission of the offence of theft while armed with a firearm would largely
defeat the clear intention of Parliament.

I do not find persuasive as a reason for
excluding robbery while armed with a firearm from the application of s. 83  the
fact that robbery itself is punishable by life imprisonment under the Code. Section 83 
clearly would

[Page 314]

properly be invoked where a firearm is used
in the commission of rape or breaking and entering a dwelling-house with intent
to commit an indictable offence therein, both of which offences are punishable
by life imprisonment.

In R. v. Matheson the Manitoba Court of
Appeal, several months after the decision in Langevin, was called upon
to face the question faced by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Langevin. Mr. Justice
Monnin speaking for himself and Freedman C.J.M. (Hall J.A. differing on another
point), and without mentioning either Quon or Langevin, said, in
reference to s. 83  (at p. 101):

This is a recent offence created
specifically by Parliament to deter the use of firearms while committing other
offences. Parliament has recently and deliberately provided additional and
consecutive terms of imprisonment for such offences. Counsel for the accused
argued that Dubienski, Prov.J., erred in imposing multiple convictions for the
same delict and sought to find assistance in Kienapple v. The Queen (1974),
15 C.C.C. (2d) 524, 44 D.L.R. (3d) 351, 26 C.R.N.S. 1.

He then read s. 83  and continued:

Parliament in its wisdom has created a new
offence and provided in unambiguous language that the sentence in such new
offence is to be served consecutively. It has further provided that in the case
of second and subsequent such offences, the minimum consecutive term of
imprisonment should not be less than three years. This is intentional and the
language is unambiguous. If this constitutes punishment for the same delict, it
is a punishment which Parliament has decided upon. The section must be
enforced as written.

The Matheson case was appealed to this
Court. Judgment was delivered on June 22, 1981[1]
and the appeal allowed, but on another ground. The judgment makes no reference
whatever to the point presently under discussion.

[Page 315]

Three months later the Manitoba Court of Appeal,
differently constituted, decided the case of R. v. Nicholson, supra. Mr. Justice
Matas spoke for the Court, and in the course of his judgment said (at p. 118):

To clear away one question—the rule against
multiple convictions—I respectfully agree with the decision in R. v.
Langevin (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 138. The Ontario Court of Appeal (Martin,
Houlden and Zuber JJ.A.) held that:

An accused may be convicted of the offence
contrary to s. 83  of the Criminal Code  of using a firearm while
committing ‘an indictable offence’ where that offence is robbery contrary to s.
302 (d) of the Criminal Code  and the accused has been convicted of
the robbery. The wording of s. 83  shows a clear legislative intention to depart
from the fundamental principle that an accused should not be punished twice for
the same matter.

Very shortly after the Langevin case came
before the Ontario Court of Appeal, the case of R. v. Eby, supra, was
heard by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division. Eby had been charged
with attempting to steal while armed with offensive weapons, to wit, a.45
calibre pistol and a.38 calibre revolver. He pleaded guilty to the charge of
attempted robbery. The trial judge acquitted him of a further charge under s.
83 (1)(c) of the Code, applying the reasoning in the Quon case.
The Appeal Division allowed the Crown’s appeal from acquittal. Jones J.A.
quoted at length, with approval, what had been said by Martin J.A. in Langevin
concluding (at pp. 32 and 34):

I agree with the reasoning of the Ontario
Court of Appeal in the Langevin case. When one examines s. 83  in the
light of the extensive revision of Part II. 1 of the Criminal Code  it is
clear that Parliament intended to impose very severe restrictions on the
ownership and use of firearms in Canada. The object was to restrict the availability and use of firearms
during the commission of criminal offences. It has been aptly described as “gun
control” legislation. The original Bill C-83 introduced in Parliament on February 24, 1976, was entitled “An Act for the
better protection of Canadian society against perpetrators of violent and other
crime”.

[Page 316]

and,

It would appear that Parliament has clearly
provided for multiple convictions under s. 83  and accordingly the principle in Kienapple,
supra, is not applicable to a charge under that section.

The decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal in R.
v. Pineault; R. v. Bérubé, supra, is consistent with that of the other
courts of appeal to which I have referred. The headnote reads:

As a general rule, an accused cannot in
Canadian criminal law be punished twice for offences based on the same set of
facts unless Parliament clearly indicates an intention to the contrary. In
enacting s. 83  and subs. (2) of that section, Parliament intended to
specifically ban the use of firearms and to impose a second penalty for the
same set of facts. Parliament intended to punish more severely those who make
use of firearms, and effect should be given to such purpose. A crime under s.
228 can be committed by means of a firearm, and also by means of other weapons,
such as a hammer or a crowbar. It can even be committed by the use of a fist.

Let me say, with respect, that I agree with the
judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Langevin and with the
judgments of those courts which followed that decision.

Four courts of appeal which have considered the
matter have agreed in six different cases upon an important point of criminal
law. Although not unheard of, it is a sufficiently rare occurrence as to merit
attention. It suggests that the point is reasonably clear, and one should be
cautious in arriving at a different conclusion. Many of the criminal cases
which reach this Court do so because of differing views of provincial appellate
courts. The unanimity in this case cannot but be significant.

That aside, it is well to recall the legislative
history of s. 83 . It formed part of a comprehensive “gun control” legislative
scheme intended to discourage the use of firearms by the criminal element of
our society. Penalties were more than doubled. Compare ss. 84(1), 85, 88(2),
89(3), 89(1), 94(1) with the earlier ss. 86 , 83 , 90 , 94 , 91(1) , 92 .
Section 83  was added as a new offence,

[Page 317]

after the decisions of this Court in Quon and
Kienapple were well known. Section 83  is materially different from
the earlier s. 122. It is more narrowly phrased, less draconian, thereby avoiding
some of the “absurdities” which gave this Court concern in Quon. The
emphasis is now upon “use” of a firearm, a very different concept than “has
upon his person”. The word “firearm” is narrowly and clearly defined.

One of the matter which troubled the Ontario
Court of Appeal in Quon was the fact that the penalty provided by s. 122
was not additional punishment attaching to the commission of “any other
offence” but rather a sanction imposed for the commission of the specific
offence defined by the section. That concern was removed in the repeal of s.
122 and the enactment of s. 83 . I will repeat s. 83(2) for ease of reference:

(2) A sentence imposed on a person for an
offence under subsection (1) shall be served consecutively to any other
punishment imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same event or
series of events and to any other sentence to which he is subject at the time
the sentence is imposed on him for an offence under subsection (1).

The subsection contemplates that the
sentence imposed upon a person who uses a firearm while committing or
attempting to commit an indictable offence shall be served consecutively to any
other punishment imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same event. I
do not know what clearer language could be used to negate the so-called Kienapple
principle.

One must also, I think, ask why Parliament,
gravely concerned with the proliferation of firearm-related crime, would pass
legislation giving absolution from s. 83  to those using firearms in the commission
of those crimes in which firearms are most likely to be used. If the contention
of the appellant is correct, s. 83  is limited to those crimes in which firearms
are not likely to be used, such as forgery or rape. Such an interpretation
would seem to me to defeat the plain and express language of the section.

[Page 318]

In R. v. Quon, supra, Kellock J. stated
(at p. 520):

It is obvious of course that Parliament
may, if it sees fit, constitute two separate offences out of the same act or
omission or make part of an act or omission or one or more of a series of acts
or omissions a separate offence additional to that constituted by the complete
act or omission or the whole series.

The same thought is expressed in the Kienapple
case (at p. 753, per Laskin C.J.):

Parliament’s power to constitute two
separate offences out of the same matter is not in question, but unless there
is a clear indication that multiple prosecutions and, indeed, multiple
convictions are envisaged, the common law principle expressed in the Cox and
Paton case should be followed.

In my view Parliament has in the enactment of s.
83  departed from the fundamental common law principle of the criminal law that nemo
debet bis puniri pro uno delicto, elaborated in Kienapple, and has
shown that the use of a firearm in the commission of the offence of robbery
shall also constitute a separate and distinct offence under s. 83  for which a
separate and additional (increased in the case of second or subsequent offence)
punishment shall be imposed.

It seems clear that what was intended in the
enactment of s. 83  was to impose an additional penalty for what is, in effect,
an aggravated form of robbery. Robbery can be committed without either the
possession or the use of a firearm. The “use” of a “firearm” is not an
essential element of the crime of robbery. A person may be convicted of that
crime in the absence of a pistol, revolver or other firearms. Anyone who steals
from any person while armed with an offensive weapon, or even the imitation of
an offensive weapon, commits robbery. An offensive weapon would include a
knife, a broken bottle, a baseball bat, a bicycle chain. The offence is
complete if the accused is “armed with” the offensive weapon—he need not “use”
it. When Parliament turned its attention to s. 83  it is obvious from the
language used that Parliament was concerned with “use”, not innocent
possession, and concerned with “firearms”, not knives or toy pistols.
Parliament clearly contemplated that when in

[Page 319]

the course of a robbery a firearm is used,
multiple prosecutions and multiple convictions would follow and would supplant
the common law principle expressed in Kienapple and in Cox and Paton
v. The Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 500.

I would have thought Parliament would have had
in mind the very sort of thing that happened in this case, an attempt to steal
with the aid of a shot-gun for the purpose of intimidating the victim. The
would-be robbers entered the store with a shot-gun which was obviously loaded
and, it would appear, cocked. Mr. Barbetta, the firearms examiner,
testified that in order to put the shot-gun in a firing position, it has to be
cocked manually. As I have mentioned, the weapon discharged when the proprietor
of the store wrested it from one of the accused. Shot‑guns kill or maim
with great ease at close range and the three accused are fortunate that the
pellets struck the ceiling and not Mr. Ik-Soo Kim or his wife Sundae Tie
Kim or their baby. This was an aggravated form of robbery which exposed the
intended victim to serious injury or death.

If Parliament had intended to exclude from the
meaning of the words “an indictable offence” in s. 83(1) (a) any criminal
offence an essential element of which is the having of a firearm, it could have
made its meaning clear through apt words, or it could have simply re-enacted
the former s. 122, which had been judicially interpreted restrictively, as the
new s. 83 . Parliament did neither.

For the foregoing reasons, and for the reasons
given by Mr. Justice Martin in the Langevin case, I conclude that
the conviction on the charge of attempted armed robbery did not preclude a
conviction on the charge under s. 83 of the Code. I would dismiss the
appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Criminal law — Impaired driving — Care or
control — No intention to drive — Applicability of s. 237(1)(a) in a charge
under s. 236  of Criminal Code . R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, as amended.

Appellant was found intoxicated in the
driver's seat of his vehicle parked in a field at a party and was charged with
having care or control contrary to s. 236  of the Criminal Code . He
had earlier agreed to another person's driving his vehicle after the party. The
trial court acquitted him on the ground that s. 237(1) (a) applied in that
although he had the care or control of the vehicle he lacked the intention to
drive. The Court of Appeal held an absence of intention to drive a vehicle did
not constitute a good defence to the charge. This appeal is to determine the mens
rea for the offence.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Beetz, Estey, McIntyre, Chouinard and Lamer J.J.: Section 237(1)(a)
does not import an element of ""intent to drive"" into the offence of
care or control which is created by s. 236 . Section 237(1)(a) is
concerned exclusively with the method of proof of a charge under s. 236 ; its
effect is purely evidentiary so that the offence created by s. 236  remains
unaffected. Proof that the accused did not enter the vehicle with the intention
of setting it in motion does not of itself lead to an acquittal where an
accused performs some act or series of acts involving the use of the car, its
fitting or equipment, which indicate that the accused had care or control of
the vehicle.

The case of R. v. Young has not
applicability; it was not concerned with the presumption created by s. 237(1)(a).

[page 232]

Per Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J., dissenting: Although s. 237 is concerned with
evidentiary matters it can be looked to as an aid to interpreting the patent
ambiguity in s. 236 . It creates a rebuttable presumption of having ""care
or control"" over, not having intention to drive, a motor vehicle. An
intention to set the vehicle in motion is an essential element of the offence.
If an accused demonstrates that he did not have that intention the Crown has
failed to prove an essential element of the offence and the accused deserves to
be acquitted.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of Prince Edward Island (1979), 24 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 91 reversing a judgment
of Plamondon J. on an appeal by way of stated case. Appeal dismissed, Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting.

Darrell E. Coombs, for the respondent.

The
reasons of Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. were delivered by

DICKSON
J. (dissenting)—The issue in this appeal is narrow but it has given rise
to conflict of views at both trial and appellate level for thirty years. The
question is: what is the mens rea for the offence of
having the 'care or control' of a motor vehicle while intoxicated? The relevant
sections of the Criminal
Code  are ss. 236(1)  and 237(1) (a),
reproduced below:

236. (1) Every one who drives a motor vehicle
or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not,
having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion thereof in his
blood exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood, is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence
punishable on summary conviction and is liable

(a) for a first offence, to a fine of not
more than two thousand dollars and not less than fifty dollars or to
imprisonment for six months or to both;

(b) for a second offence, to imprisonment for
not more than one year and not less than fourteen days; and

[page 233]

(c) for each subsequent offence, to imprisonment for not more than two
years and not less than three months.

237. (1) In any proceedings under section 234 
or 236 ,

(a) where it is proved that the accused occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver of a motor vehicle, he shall
be deemed to have had the care or control
of the vehicle unless he establishes that he did not enter or mount the
vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion; ...

Section 237, it will be noted, does not create
an irrebuttable presumption of care or control. The section permits the accused
to rebut the presumption if he ""establishes that he did not enter or mount
the vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion"". What if the accused
successfully establishes that he did not mount the vehicle with the intention
of setting it in motion? Is he then to be acquitted? In plainer terms, is an intention
to set the vehicle in motion an ingredient of the offence of having care or
control of a motor vehicle while in a state of intoxication? If an intention to
set in motion is the mens rea of the offence,
elementary principles of criminal law would suggest that an accused who rebuts
the presumption in s. 237 must be acquitted, since the Crown has failed to
prove one of the ingredients of the offence. On the other hand, if an intention
to set in motion is not an essential ingredient of the offence, the accused may
or may not be guilty, depending on whether the Crown can adduce other evidence
to prove care or control.

The appellant, David Benjamin Ford, was charged
that he did on or about March 16, 1979 at or near Ebenezer, in the County of
Queens, Province of Prince Edward Island, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity
that the proportion in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood, unlawfully have care or control of a motor vehicle,
contrary to s. 236  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, as
amended. He was found not guilty of the offence and acquitted by the Provincial
Court Judge.

The Crown appealed by way of stated case from
which the following facts emerge. At 11:35 p.m. on

[page 234]

March 16, 1979 a
police constable on patrol observed motor vehicles in a field near the highway.
He drove to the location and found Mr. Ford sitting behind the steering wheel
of a vehicle in the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver. The dome light of
the car was on, and there were five or six occupants. Ford, owner of the
vehicle, had been in and out of it numerous times during the course of the
evening, going from one car to another. He had turned the motor on and off a
number of times because of the cold weather. During the course of the evening,
because of his impaired condition, Mr. Ford had agreed with one Darla Simpson
that she would drive his car when the party broke up and the car had to be
driven out of the field.

The trial judge held
that s. 237(1)(a) applied
but he held also that when Mr. Ford entered the vehicle for the last time he
had no intention of driving and had therefore discharged the onus under s. 237(1)(a).
The judge further held that because Mr. Ford
was sitting behind the steering wheel of the vehicle, which was running, and
had not yet traded places with Darla Simpson, he still had the care or control
of the vehicle but, because he had no intention to drive, he had a good defence
to the charge.

The Crown questioned
the validity of the decision. The question asked on the stated case was this:
""Did I err in law in holding that the necessary mens rea for a charge under section 236  of the Criminal Code  relating to the 'care or control' of a
motor vehicle went to the intention of the accused to drive the motor vehicle
or set it in motion, and not the intention to assume or have care or control of
the motor vehicle?"" Although the question was phrased in that manner in
the case stated, the judge was of the view that the question should have taken
the following form: ""Did I err in law in holding that after finding an
accused in care or control of a motor vehicle, he still has a defence to the
charge by showing that he had no intention to drive the motor vehicle?"",
adding that his decision ""did not equate the intention to drive with mens

[page 235]

rea but rather as being a defence to
the charge"".

The
Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, in banco, in a decision reported at (1979),
24 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 91, held that, regardless of the manner in which the
question may have been framed, the trial judge had erred in holding that an
absence of intention to drive the motor vehicle constituted a good defence to a
charge of care or control. The reasoning of the Court was summarized in the
judgment as follows:

Put briefly and succinctly, I would hold the
law to be this:

(a) Section 236  creates the offences of
driving, or having the care, or having the control, of a motor vehicle while
impaired;

(b) the mens rea required, in the case of
driving, is either the driving itself, or the intention to drive;

(c) the mens rea required, in the cases of
care or control, is the intention to assume such care or control;

(d) Section 237(1)(a) creates a rebuttable
presumption of intention to drive;

(e) the successful rebuttal by the accused of
that presumption negates the effect of that section, but leaves undisturbed the
effect of Section 236 , which then must be dealt with on its own factual merits;

(f) a conviction may then be obtained on a
driving charge if the evidence establishes actual driving;

(g) a conviction may then be obtained on a
care or control charge if the evidence, establishes an intention to drive,
(apart from the statutory presumption), or alternatively if the evidence
establishes an intention to assume some measure of active control over or with
respect to the vehicle, notwithstanding the absence of any intention to drive
[at pp. 95-96, emphasis added].

If
the Court of Appeal is correct we are left with this somewhat curious
situation: in a prosecution for having care or control of a motor vehicle while
intoxicated, an intention to set the vehicle in motion is not an essential
ingredient of the offence; nevertheless, the accused may be called upon to
disprove such an intention or be convicted if the Crown invokes the presumption
in s. 237. If an intention to set the vehicle in motion is not part of

[page 236]

the mens rea of the offence, why should the accused be concerned
with disproving such intention?

There are many
authorities on the mens
rea of a care or control
offence under s. 236 , with various views expressed. There is one decision of
this Court, R. v.
Appleby, [1972] S.C.R.
303, which obliquely discusses the point. This discussion is admittedly obiter dicta, since the issue in that case was the
meaning of the word 'establishes' ins. 237. Ritchie J., writing for the
majority of the Court, held that s. 237 required the accused to prove, on a
balance of probabilities, that he did not have an
intention to set the vehicle in motion. Ritchie J. also commented, however,
that if an accused could succeed in disproving this
intention, he should be acquitted:

In giving effect to the statutory presumption
created by s. 224A(1)(a) in relation to a charge under s. 222, the position is
that if it is proved that the accused was impaired by alcohol or a drug, and it
is further proved that he was, at the relevant time, occuping [sic] the seat
ordinarily occupied by the driver, he shall be deemed to have had the care or control of the
vehicle, but the accused has the opportunity of rebutting this presumption if
he ""establishes"" by the balance of probabilities ""that he did
not enter or mount the vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion"".

If the accused cannot so satisfy the court
then the statutory presumption prevails and he is guilty of an offence under s.
222, but, if he is able to provide the requisite evidence he must be acquitted
[at p. 316].

Mr. Justice Ritchie
based his observations on the discussion of statutory presumptions by Lord
Diplock in Public
Prosecutor v. Yuvaraj, [1970]
2 W.L.R. 226, at p. 232:

Generally speaking, no onus lies upon a
defendant in criminal proceedings to prove or disprove any fact: it is
sufficient for his acquittal if any of the facts which, if they existed, would constitute the offence with
which he is charged, are ""not
proved."" But exceptionally, as in the present case, an enactment creating an offence expressly provides
that if other facts are proved, a particular fact, the existence of which is a
necessary factual ingredient of the offence, shall be presumed or deemed to
exist

[page 237]

""unless the contrary is proved."" In
such a case the consequence of finding that that particular fact is
""disproved"" will be an acquittal, whereas the absence of such a finding will have the consequence of a conviction.

As Lord Diplock
points out, the effect of a ""reverse onus"" clause is to force the
accused either to prove or disprove the existence of a particular set of facts.
This set of facts is always an essential ingredient of the offence. It would be
peculiar to suppose otherwise. If the facts are not an essential ingredient of
the offence, then how can 'disproving' them possibly assist the accused? A
reverse onus clause makes sense only if the particular facts are understood as
being essential to the commission of the offence.

Various propositions
have been advanced as to the mens rea of care or control of a motor
vehicle. It has been said by some to be the intention to assume care or control
of the vehicle but, standing by itself, this is unsatisfactory as it does not
serve to limit or define the already vague actus reus of care and control. It has been said by others to be the intention to
drive the vehicle. There has been a reluctance to adopt this proposition,
perhaps because of confusion with the mens rea of the driving offence.
If ""intention to drive"" is the mens rea of the driving offence
how, one might ask, can it also be the mens rea of the care or control
offence? The use of the word ""intention"" is misleading in this
context. An ""intention to drive"" while one is driving is not the same
as the ""intention to drive"" demonstrated by a person putting keys in
an ignition and his foot on the accelerator. The latter is more properly
""intention to set the car in motion"". This latter proposition has
also been advanced as the mens rea required to constitute the offence,
and, as it is the language used in s. 237(1)(a), it would certainly seem to be
that most consonant with the legislation.

The use of intention
to set in motion' as the mens rea for the offence of care or control has
a number of virtues. It narrows the vague ""intention

[page 238]

to assume care or
control"" and gives precision and focus to the offence. It is consistent
with legislative intent as evidenced in s. 237(1)(a). It is more closely
connected to the mischief which the legislator seeks to control and it
eliminates the more extreme and absurd results which are within the realm of
the imagination.

Whether or not the
intention exists is, of course, a determination for the trial judge to make. An
accused may deny any intention to set the vehicle in motion but the trial judge
is in a position to believe or disbelieve him in the circumstances of each
case.

In the present case
the Court of Appeal states that s. 237 creates a rebuttable presumption of
intention to drive in proposition (d) cited above. With respect, this is simply
wrong. Section 237 creates a rebuttable presumption of having 'care or control'
over a motor vehicle. The presumption may be rebutted by the accused if he can
establish that he did not have an intention to set the vehicle in motion.

The error in
proposition (d) opens the way for the Court to conclude, in propositions (e)
and (f), that the rebuttal of the presumption in s. 237 does not lead to an
acquittal under s. 236 . The Court treats the two sections as though they were
directed towards different offences. Section 237, apparently, creates a
rebuttable 'intention to drive'. This intention is, in the Court's view,
irrelevant to the intention to assume care or control: therefore, rebutting the
presumption in s. 237 ""leaves undisturbed the effect of section 236 ""
(proposition (e)).

Consider the
following situation. Suppose that the Crown's only evidence of care or control
was the fact that an accused was sitting in the driver's seat. The accused then
adduces evidence to establish that he did not intend to set the vehicle in
motion. In such a case, on the view of the Court of Appeal in this case, the
accused would have to be acquitted. The accused could only be convicted if the
Crown adduced some further evidence to establish care or control and the Crown,
in the example I have given, failed to do so. Thus the accused would be
acquitted.

[page 239]

Such a result would
be strange indeed if an intention to set the vehicle in motion were not an
essential ingredient of the offence of having care or control over a motor
vehicle while intoxicated. The accused would be acquitted by proving something
which, according to the Court of Appeal, was totally extraneous to the offence.
How can proving an irrelevant fact rebut anything? Such a proposition offends
common sense and must be wrong.

The problem with
which we are faced began even in the manner in which the question was framed in
the courts below and in this Court. The Court of Appeal was faced with the
question of whether a lack of intention to drive was a 'defence' to a charge of
impaired driving. The Court of Appeal answered this question in the negative.

In my view, it is
incorrect to ask whether a lack of intention to drive is a 'defence' to a
charge. The accused in this case is not asserting that lack of intention to
drive is a positive defence. Rather, his argument is that an intention to set
the vehicle in motion is the mental element of the offence of 'care or control'
under s. 236 . Thus if an accused does not have an intention to set the vehicle
in motion he has not really established a 'defence'; he has demonstrated that
the Crown has failed to prove an essential element of the offence and thus
deserves to be acquitted.

It is obvious that
simply clarifying the issue does not resolve the appeal. The question which
arises is this: on what basis can it be said that an 'intention to set the
vehicle in motion' forms the mental element of the offence under s. 236 ?

Section 236  itself
does not specify the requisite mental element for the offence of care or
control. The section specifies that if one has ""care or control of a motor
vehicle, whether it is in motion or not"", and one's blood alcohol level
exceeds a certain level, then an offence has been committed. The section does
not specifically indicate the

[page 240]

mental element required
to establish 'care or control'. Is the mental element the intention to have
care or control? On this view an individual who is sitting in his living room with the keys to his car
in his pocket has the
mental element necessary to constitute the offence. Care or control in the Criminal
Code  should not be confused with the indicia of possession under the law of property. An intention simply to exclude others from
control is not sufficient; in my view one must also have an intention to set
the vehicle in motion before one comes within the subsection.

Surely it is
legitimate for a court to look at s. 237 in order to assist it in resolving the
ambiguity present in s. 236 . We are expected to read the sections in their
entirety in an attempt to give meaning to a part thereof.

1 do not think it
helps in the resolution of the question before the Court to argue that s. 237
is concerned with evidentiary matters only and therefore the offence created by
s. 236  remains unaffected by it. I do not suggest that s. 237 somehow alters s.
236  or creates a positive defence to the charge under s. 236 . I agree that s.
237 is concerned with evidentiary matters. However this does not mean that we
cannot look to s. 237 as an aid to interpreting the patent ambiguity in s. 236 .

In my view s. 237 is
available as an important interpretative aid in determining the mens rea for
a charge under s. 236 . Section 237 becomes absurd unless an intention to put
the vehicle in motion is part of the mental element of care or control under s.
236 . Otherwise, if the Crown is right, s. 237 is the only section in the Code
which imputes a certain mental element to an accused even though that
mental element is not the mens rea of the offence.

Assuming that an
intention to set the vehicle in motion constitutes the mental element of the
offence, what is the result if the accused can demonstrate that he did not have
that intention? The question answers itself. If an essential element of the
offence is lacking, then the accused must be

[page 241]

acquitted. The Crown has simply failed to prove
its case.

Normally, the rule is that the Crown must prove
the elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. It is obvious that the
Crown may have trouble proving that an accused sitting in a car had the
intention of setting the car in motion. Section 237 changes that. It alters the
burden of proof in favour of the Crown. If an accused is found sitting in the
driver's seat, we presume that he had an intention to set the vehicle in
motion. It will then rest on him to disprove that he had any such intention.
His proof will be on a balance of probabilities. If he succeeds why should he
not be acquitted, as his conduct is not within the mischief aimed at?

Quite apart from authority, it seems to me that
the appellant's position is the stronger one, simply on the basis of statutory
construction and the nature and effect of statutory presumptions. I must say,
however, that I am in agreement with the views of Jessup J.A., speaking for a
unanimous Ontario Court of Appeal (Jessup, Dubin and Martin JJ.A.) in R. v. McPhee; R. v. Mullen (1975), 30
C.R.N.S. 4:

In a prosecution
under s. 234 [now s. 236 ] if the only proof offered by the Crown of care or control is
that the accused occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver of
a motor vehicle and the accused establishes that he did not enter or mount the
vehicle for the purpose of. setting it in motion, the accused must
be acquitted. It follows therefore, in my
opinion, that in a prosecution under
s. 234 it is an essential element of the offence that the accused had the
purpose or intention of setting the vehicle in motion, either personally
or through the agency of a driver he controlled. The accused must have the intent to assume control over the
operation of the car [at pp. 6-7].

Leave to appeal to this Court from this decision
was dismissed on June 16, 1975.

R. v. McPhee; R.
v. Mullen, supra, was applied in R. v. White (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 353,
(Ont. C.A.). Martin J.A. speaking for a Court consisting of himself, Howland
C.J.O. and Brooke J.A. said:

[page 242]

This Court held in R. v. McPhee; R. v. Mullen (1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 412, 9 O.R. (2d) 687, 30 C.R.N.S. 4, that an intention to operate the motor vehicle is an
essential element of ""care or control"". A fair reading of the
appellant's evidence supports a conclusion that he had abandoned any intention
of driving his motor vehicle after it had
become stuck in the ditch. If the appellant did not intend to operate the vehicle after he had consumed the liquor, subsequent to
the car going into the ditch, the
offence was not established [at p. 354].

I would add only this. If I should be wrong and
intent to set the vehicle in motion is not an ingredient of the offence of care
or control I would nonetheless enter an acquittal in this case as Mr. Ford
rebutted the presumption under s. 237(1)(a) and the Crown has not in my opinion
adduced further evidence sufficient to warrant a finding of care or control.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal and restore the verdict of acquittal rendered at trial.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Beetz, Estey,
McIntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an
appeal brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Appeal Division
of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, holding that the learned trial
judge had erred in holding that an absence of intention to drive a motor
vehicle constituted a good defence to a charge of care or control under s. 236
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
and ordering that this matter be remitted back to His Honour Provincial Judge
Bertrand R. Plamondon for disposition in conformity with the judgment of the
Appeal Division.

The facts of this case are not in dispute and
are fully set out in the case stated by the learned provincial judge which
reads as follows:

1. On the 2nd day of May, 1979, an
Information was laid under oath before E.
Dorothy Kitson, Justice of the Peace for the Province of Prince Edward
Island, by Donald Gosse, a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, for that the above-named David Benjamin

[page 243]

Ford did on or about the 16th day of March
A.D. 1979, at or near Ebenezer, in the County of Queens, Province of Prince
Edward Island, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion
in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood,
unlawfully have care or control of a motor vehicle, contrary to Section 236  of
the Criminal Code  of Canada and amendments thereto. On the 9th day of May A.D.
1979, the said charge was duly read before me in the presence of the accused
and after hearing the evidence adduced and submissions made on behalf of the
Crown and the accused, I found the said David Benjamin Ford not guilty of the
said offence and acquitted him. At the request of Darrell E. Coombs, Solicitor
for Her Majesty the Queen, I state the following case for the consideration of
this Honourable Court.

(i) It was shown before me that Cst. W.
Gairns was patrolling in the Ebenezer area in Queens County, Province of Prince
Edward Island, on Highway No. 224 at the hour of 11.35 p.m., on the 16th day of
March, 1979.

(ii) Some motor vehicles attracted his
attention in a field nearby the highway and he drove the police car to the
location.

(iii) The officer found the accused sitting
behind the steering wheel in the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver, the
dome light of one vehicle was on and there were five or six occupants in this
particular vehicle.

(iv) As a result of his observation of the
accused, (the usual signs of impairment), the said officer made forthwith at
11.45 p.m. a demand on the accused to provide samples of his breath, which
demand the accused understood and agreed to provide.

(v) The officer and the accused proceeded to
Charlottetown detachment, where breathalyzer tests were performed on the
accused and a copy of the certificate together with a notice of intention to
produce the certificate was served on the accused on the 17th day of March,
1979, the said certificate showing that at the hour of 12.42 a.m. on the 17th
day of March, 1979, the result of the chemical analysis shows a reading of 190
milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, and at the hour of 1.06 a.m.
on the 17th day of March, 1979, the result of the chemical analysis was 170
milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.

(vi) The accused, who owns the car, had been
in and out of the motor vehicle numerous times during the course of the
evening, going from one car to the other, and had also turned the motor of his
motor vehicle on and off a number of times because of the cold weather.

(vii) During the course of the evening,
because of his impaired condition, the accused had agreed with one Darla
Simpson for her to drive the accused's motor

[page 244]

vehicle when the party was going to break up
and the car had to be driven out of the field.

2. I held that Section 237(1)(a) applied to
the case at bar and when the accused entered the motor vehicle the last time,
he had no intention to drive, therefore, he had discharged the onus under
Section 237(1)(a). However, because the accused was still sitting behind the
steering wheel of his own motor vehicle which was running and had not yet
traded places with Darla Simpson, I held that he still had the care and control
of the motor vehicle, but because he had
no intention to drive, I held that he had a good defence to the charge of having
the care and control of a motor vehicle. [The italics are my own.]

3. The Appellant, Her Majesty the Queen,
desires to question the validity of the decision on the ground that it is
erroneous in point of law, the grounds of appeal as stated by the Appellant
being,

""Did I err in law in holding that the
necessary mens rea for a charge under Section 236  of the Criminal Code  relating
to the care and control of a motor vehicle went to the intention of the accused
to drive the motor vehicle or set it in motion and not the intention to assume
or have care and control of the motor vehicle?""

4. It is humbly submitted that the question
as framed is not supported by my decision but should take the following form,

""Did I err in law in holding that after
finding an accused in care or control of a motor vehicle, he still has a
defence to the charge by showing that he had no intention to drive the motor
vehicle?""

It is submitted that my decision did not
equate the intention to drive with means rea [sic] but rather as
being a defence to the charge.

In
the course of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf
of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, Mr.
Justice McQuaid answered the question so posed in the following terms:

Regardless of the manner in which the
question put to this Court may have been framed, I am of opinion, and hold,
that the learned trial judge did err in holding that an absence of intention to
drive a motor vehicle constituted a good defence to a charge of care or
control.

[page 245]

The
notice of appeal to this Court raises the following two grounds of appeal:

1. Whether the Supreme Court of Prince Edward
Island, in Banco erred in holding that
an absence of intention to drive a motor
vehicle does not constitute a valid defence to a charge under section
236  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1970 —
Cap. C-34;

2. Whether the Supreme Court of Prince Edward
Island, in Banco erred in reversing
the position it had adopted with respect to
the above-noted defence in R. v. Young (1979), 21 Nfld. Sc P.E.I.R. 77 (P.E.I.
S.C. In Banco).

The
disposition of this appeal turns in great measure upon the answer to the first
question and is dependant upon whether or not s. 237 of the Code is to be construed as importing an element of ""intent to
drive"" into the offence of ""care or control"" which is created by
s. 236 . The relevant provisions of s. 236  read as follows:

236. (1) Every one who drives a motor vehicle
or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, having consumed alcohol in such a
quantity that the proportion thereof in his blood exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood,
is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary
conviction and is liable .. .

It
is to be noted that the offence of ""care or control"" created by this
section is not dependant upon the motor vehicle being in motion, but it is
nevertheless contended that s. 237(1)(a) is to be construed as meaning that the
question of whether or not at the time when the accused entered or mounted the
vehicle it was ""for the purpose of setting it in motion"" is central
to a determination of his guilt or innocence under s. 236 . Section 237 (1)(a)
provides:

237. (1) In any proceedings under section 234 
or 236 ,

(a) where it is proved that the accused
occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver of a motor vehicle, he
shall be deemed to have had the care or control
of the vehicle unless he establishes that he did not enter or mount the
vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion; . . .

I
should say at the outset that I am in agreement with the Appeal Division, for
the reasons

[page 246]

stated by Mr. Justice
McQuaid, that s. 237(1)(a) is concerned exclusively with the method of proof of
a charge under s. 236  and that its effect is purely evidentiary so that the
offence created by the latter section remains unaffected by it. There can be no
doubt that if the case for the Crown rests solely upon proof that the accused
occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver, he is not deemed to have
had care or control of the vehicle if he can establish that he did not enter or
mount it for the purpose of setting it in motion. In the latter event the
presumption is rebutted and the Crown is deprived of the advantage of the
deeming provision of s. 237(1)(a). In practical terms the only result of the
accused having established that he did not mount the vehicle for the purpose of
setting it in motion, is that the Crown is seized with the burden of proof
without the aid of the presumption. The latter words of s. 237(1)(a) are in my
view definitive of the evidence required of the accused in order to shift the
burden of proof back to the Crown, but I cannot see that they purport to create
or define a defence to the charge or to alter the nature of the offence created
by s. 236  so as to import ""an intention to drive"" as an essential
element which the Crown is required to prove in order to secure a conviction
under s. 236 .

In this regard it is
to be recalled that s. 236  creating the offence of ""care or control of a
motor vehicle while intoxicated"" was enacted as part of the Criminal Code  by 1925 (Can.), c. 38, s. 5, whereas it was
not until 1947 (by c. 55, s. 10) that the presumption which is now s. 237(1) (a)
was created. I adopt what was said by Limerick J.A. in the course of his
reasons for judgment in the Appellate Division of the New Brunswick Supreme
Court in R. v. Price (1978),
40 C.C.C. (2d) 378, at p. 383, where he said:

This section is enabling legislation of
evidentiary value to the Crown. It creates, under certain specific
circumstances, a burden on the accused to rebut a prima
facie case or a presumption created by statute. The
section has no application (1) unless the
accused is found occupying the driver's seat and (2) unless the Crown elects to
invoke the section. The Crown may rely on other evidence to prove care or control, in which case the section has no applicability. The section
does not purport

[page 247]

to change the law as to the meaning of
""care or control"" as it existed prior to its enactment.

Indeed s. 37(3) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, provides:

37. (3) The repeal or amendment of an enactment
in whole or in part shall not be deemed to be or to involve any declaration as to the previous state of the law.

The amendment being enabling and directed to
a specific purpose should not, therefore, be interpreted as being restrictive or as amending or defining the
meaning of the words 'care or control', as interpreted by the Courts
prior to the amendment, nor should it be considered as indicative of the
intention of 'a previous Parliament. If Parliament in 1947 intended to define
""care or control"" as necessarily including an intention to drive the
motor vehicle involved, it could and should have so stated.

I have also had the
benefit of reading the reasons for judgment delivered by Jessup J.A. on behalf
of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. McPhee; R v. Mullen (1975), 30 C.R.N.S. 4 and I note his conclusion
that:

... if the only proof offered by the Crown of
care or control is that the accused occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by
the driver of a motor vehicle and the accused establishes that he did not enter
or mount the vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion, the accused must
be acquitted.

With all respect
this amounts to nothing more than saying that where the Crown is relying
exclusively on the presumption and the presumption is rebutted, there is then
no evidence left for the prosecution and the accused must be acquitted. There
can in my view be no denying the force of this reasoning. I am, however, unable
to agree with the next sentence of Mr. Justice Jessup's reasons for judgment in
which he says: ""It follows therefore, in my opinion, that in a prosecution
under s. 234 it is an essential element of the offence
that the accused had the purpose or intention of setting the vehicle in motion
...

In the present case
the appellant's counsel placed great reliance on the judgment of this Court in R. v. Appleby, [1972] S.C.R. 303 which he treated as affording authority for the
proposition that ""an acquittal is automatic where the accused is able to
rebut the presumption of care or

[page 248]

control under s. 237(1) (a) with evidence
carrying proof on the balance of probabilities"". This would mean that
wherever an accused establishes ""that he did not enter or mount the
vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion . . . "" he must be acquitted.

It will be found, however, that the effect of
the Appleby case is in fact limited to cases where the Crown is relying
on the presumption standing alone and gives no consideration to the offence
being established by other means. The Appleby case is concerned
exclusively with the question of the nature of the burden of proof called for
by s. 237(1)(a). In that case it was decided that the measure of proof
requisite to discharge the burden was the balance of probabilities and the mere
raising of a reasonable doubt was not sufficient. The case is not, however, any
authority to support the contention that evidence rebutting the presumption
necessarily gives rise to an acquittal notwithstanding other evidence which may
be called by the Crown to establish the offence. There is a wide difference
between rebutting a statutory presumption and establishing innocence. The
statutory presumption affords an aid to the Crown in the proof of its case, but
this is far from saying that the evidence which rebuts such a presumption
necessarily carries with it an acquittal.

In the present case the appellant was found to
be the owner of the motor vehicle in question and to have been in and out of it
numerous times during the course of the evening, and there was also evidence that
he turned the engine on and off a number of times in order to use the heater.
These are all additional factors tending to establish care or control so that
under the particular circumstances of this case rebuttal of the presumption
created by s. 237(1)(a) is far from conclusive on the issue of the guilt or
innocence of the appellant.

Nor, in my opinion, is it necessary for the
Crown to prove an intent to set the vehicle in motion in order to procure a
conviction on a charge under s. 236(1) of having care or control of a motor
vehicle, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion thereof
in his blood exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres

[page 249]

of blood. Care or control may be exercised
without such intent where an accused performs some act or series of acts
involving the use of the car, its fittings or equipment, such as occurred in
this case, whereby the vehicle may unintentionally be set in motion creating
the danger the section is designed to prevent.

For all these reasons I am of the opinion that
the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island did not err in
holding that an absence of intention to drive a motor vehicle does not
constitute a valid defence to a charge under s. 236  of the Criminal Code ,
and I would answer the first question raised by the notice of appeal
accordingly.

The second question raised by the notice of
appeal is predicated on the assumption that the Appeal Division of the Supreme
Court of Prince Edward Island reversed the position it had adopted in the case
of R. v. Young (1979), 21 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 77. I am on the contrary of opinion that
the case of R. v. Young has no
application to the present appeal and that it was not concerned with the
statutory presumption created by s. 237(1)(a). In this regard the following
excerpt from the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice McQuaid in that case is
significant and in my view conclusive of the distinction between the two cases.
The learned judge there said of Young at p. 81:

Since he was not found in the seat of the
vehicle ordinarily occupied by the driver, he does not come within the
presumption set forth in Section 237(1)(a) and can
not be ""deemed"" to have care and control. The
onus therefore rested on the Crown to
establish the care and control.

Having regard to all the above, I would dismiss
this appeal and affirm the direction of the Court of Appeal that the matter be
remitted ""back to the trial court for disposition by it having regard to
the above ruling"".

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR NOVA
SCOTIA

Criminal law — Search warrants — Right to
inspect search warrants and informations on which search warrants based —
Whether access restricted to ""interested parties"" or open to general
public — Whether right to inspect only on execution of search warrant or
whether hearings dealing with search warrants open — Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, ss. 443, 446.

Respondent, an investigative journalist, was
denied access to search warrants and supporting material by appellant Grainger,
the Justice of the Peace who had issued them, because such material was not
available for inspection by the general public. At trial, respondent was held
entitled to a declaration that search warrants after their execution, and the
informations related to them in the control of the justice of the peace or
court official, were court records available for examination by members of the
general public. In dismissing an appeal, the Appeal Court declared that the
public was entitled to inspect informations upon which search warrants were
issued pursuant to s. 443  of the Criminal Code , and that any member of
the public, including individuals

[page 176]

about to be the
subject of a search warrant, was entitled to be present in open court when the
search warrants were issued.

Held (Martland, Ritchie, Beetz and Estey JJ. dissenting): The appeal
should be dismissed.

Per Laskin C.J. and Dickson, McIntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: After a
search warrant has been executed, and objects found during the search are
brought before a justice, members of the public are entitled to inspect the
warrant, and the information upon which it was issued. Curtailment of public
accessibility is justified only where the need to protect other social values
is of superordinate importance. In cases where a search warrant is issued but
nothing is found, protection of the innocent is such an overriding social
value. Furthermore, the public interest in the effective administration of
justice must override public accessibility to the extent that the proceedings
at which the warrant is issued can be conducted in camera. Otherwise a person whose property was to be
searched could remove the goods. The need for confidentiality disappears,
however, once the warrant has been executed. At this point the public as well
as those who are directly interested have a right to inspect the warrant and
the related information.

Per Martland, Ritchie, Beetz and Estey JJ. (dissenting):
The broad declaration of the Court of Appeal, for
reasons given by Dickson J., cannot be sustained. Respondent cannot assert a
right to examine the search warrants and related informations on the basis that
the issuance of the search warrants was a judicial act in open court with a
right for the public to be present.

Proceedings before a justice under s. 443  are
part and parcel of criminal investigative procedure and are not analogous to
trial proceedings which are generally required to be conducted in open court.
The opening to public inspection of the documents before the justice is not
equivalent to the right of the public to attend and witness proceedings in
court. Access to these documents should be restricted to persons who can show a
direct and tangible interest in the documents. There is no general right to
inspect search warrants and the informations relating thereto.

The judgment of
Laskin Cl and Dickson, McIntyre, Chouinard and
Lamer JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON
J.—The appellant, Ernest Harold Grainger, is
Chief Clerk of the Provincial Magistrate's Court at Halifax and also a Justice
of the Peace. In the latter capacity he had occasion to issue certain search
warrants. The respondent, Linden MacIntyre, is a television journalist

[page 178]

employed by the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation. At the material time Mr. MacIntyre was researching a story on
political patronage and fund raising. Mr. MacIntyre asked Mr. Grainger to show
him the search warrants and supporting material. Mr. Grainger refused, on the
ground that such material was not available for inspection by the general
public. Mr. MacIntyre commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia,
Trial Division, for an order that search warrants and informations relating
thereto, issued pursuant to s. 443 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, or other related or similar statutes, are a matter of public record and
may be inspected by a member of the public upon reasonable request.

Mr. Justice Richard of the Trial Division of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia delivered reasons approving Mr. Maclntyre's
application. He held that Mr. MacIntyre was entitled to a declaration to the
effect that search warrants ""which have been executed"", and
informations relating thereto, which are in the control of the justice of the
peace or a court official are court records available for examination by
members of the general public.

An appeal brought by the Attorney General of
Nova Scotia and by Mr. Grainger to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia was dismissed. The Appeal Division proceeded on much broader
grounds than Richard J. The order dismissing the appeal contained a declaration
""that a member of the public is entitled to inspect informations upon
which search warrants have been issued pursuant to section 443  of the Criminal Code  of
Canada"". The Court also declared that Mr. MacIntyre was entitled to be
present in open court when the search warrants were issued. This right, the
Appeal Division said, extended to any member of the public, including
individuals who would be the subjects of the search warrants.

[page 179]

This Court granted
leave to appeal the judgment and order of the Appeal Division. The Attorney
General of Canada and the Attorneys General of the Provinces of Ontario,
Quebec, New Brunswick, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta intervened to
support the appellant Attorney General of Nova Scotia. The Canadian Civil Liberties
Association intervened in support of Mr. Maclntyre.

Although Mr.
MacIntyre happens to be a journalist employed by the C.B.C. he has throughout
taken the position that his standing is no higher than that of any member of
the general public. He claims no special status as a journalist.

II

A search warrant may
be broadly defined as an order issued by a justice under statutory powers,
authorizing a named person to enter a specified place to search for and seize
specified property which will afford evidence of the actual or intended
commission of a crime. A warrant may issue upon a sworn information and proof
of reasonable grounds for its issuance. The property seized must be carried
before the justice who issued the warrant to be dealt with by him according to
law.

[page 180]

Search warrants are
part of the investigative pretrial process of the criminal law, often employed
early in the investigation and before the identity of all of the suspects is
known. Parliament, in furtherance of the public interest in effective
investigation and prosecution of crime, and through the enactment of s. 443 of
the Code,
has legalized what
would otherwise be an illegal entry of premises and illegal seizure of
property. The issuance of a search warrant is a judicial act on the part of the
justice, usually performed ex parte and in camera, by the
very nature of the proceedings.

The search warrant
in recent years has become an increasingly important investigatory aid, as
crime and criminals become increasingly sophisticated and the incidence of
corporate white collar crime multiplies. The effectiveness of any search made
pursuant to the issuance of a search warrant will depend much upon timing, upon
the degree of confidentiality which attends the issuance of the warrant and upon
the element of surprise which attends the search.

As is often the case
in a free society there are at work two conflicting public interests. The one
has to do with civil liberties and the protection of the individual from
interference with the enjoyment of his property. There is a clear and important
social value in avoidance of arbitrary searches and unlawful seizures. The
other, competing, interest lies in the effective detection and proof of crime
and the prompt apprehension and conviction of offenders. Public protection,
afforded by efficient and effective law enforcement, is enhanced through the
proper use of search warrants.

In this balancing of
interests, Parliament has made a clear policy choice. The public interest in
the detection, investigation and prosecution of crimes has been permitted to
dominate the individual interest. To the extent of its reach, s. 443  has been
introduced as an aid in the administration of justice and enforcement of the
provisions of the Criminal
Code .

III

The Criminal Code 
gives little guidance
on the question of accessibility to the general public of search warrants and
the underlying informations. And there is little authority on the point. The
appellant Attorney General of Nova Scotia relied upon Taylor's Treatise on the Law of Evidence (11th ed. 1920), upon a footnote to Order 63, Rule
4 of the English Rules of Court, and upon Inland
Revenue Commissioners v. Rossminster Ltd., [1980] 2 W.L.R. 1. These authorities indicate that
under English practice there is no general right to inspect and copy judicial
records and documents. The right is only exerciseable when some direct

[page 181]

and
tangible interest or proprietary right in the documents can be demonstrated.

It
does seem clear that an individual who is 'directly interested' in the warrant
can inspect the information and the warrant after the warrant has been
executed. The reasoning here is that an interested party has a right to apply
to set aside or quash a search warrant based on a defective information (R. v. Solloway Mills & Co., [1930] 3 D.L.R. 293 (Alta. S.C.)).
This right can only be exercised if the applicant is entitled to inspect the
warrant and the information immediately after it has been executed. The point
is discussed by Mr. Justice MacDonald of the Alberta Supreme Court in Realty Renovations Ltd. v. Attorney-General for Alberta et al. (1978), 44 C.C.C. (2d)
249 at pp. 253-54:

Since the issue of a search warrant is a
judicial act and not an administrative act, it appears to me to be fundamental
that in order to exercise the right to question the validity of a search
warrant, the interested party or his counsel
must be able to inspect the search warrant and the information on which it is based. Although there is no
appeal from the issue of a search warrant, a superior Court has the right by
prerogative writ to review the act of the Justice of the Peace in issuing the
warrant. In order to launch a proper application, the applicant should know the
reasons or grounds for his application, which reasons or grounds are most
likely to be found in the form of the information or warrant. I am unable to conceive anything but a denial of
Justice if the contents of the information and warrant, after the
warrant is executed, are hidden until the police have completed the investigation
or until the Crown prosecutor decides that access to the file containing the
warrant is to be allowed. Such a restriction
could effectively delay, if not prevent review of the judicial act of
the Justice in the issue of the warrant. If a warrant is void then it should be set aside as soon as possible and the
earlier the application to set it aside can be heard, the more the right
of the individual is protected.

The
appellant, the Attorney General of Nova Scotia, does not contest the right of
an 'interested party' to inspect search warrants and informations after
execution. His contention is that Mr. MacIntyre, a member of the general
public, not directly affected by issuance of the warrant, has no right of
inspection. The question, therefore, is whether, in

[page 182]

law, any distinction can be drawn, in respect of
accessibility, between those persons who might be termed 'interested parties'
and those members of the public who are unable to show any special interest in
the proceedings.

There would seem to be only two Canadian cases
which have addressed the point. In (1959-60), 2 Crim. L.Q., 119, reference is
made to an unreported decision of Greschuk J. in Southam Publishing Company v. Mack in Supreme Court Chambers
in Calgary, Alberta. Mandamus was granted requiring a magistrate to permit a
reporter of the Calgary Herald to
inspect the information and complaints which were in his possession relating to
cases the magistrate had dealt with on a particular date.

In Realty
Renovations Ltd. v. Attorney-General for Alberta, supra, MacDonald
J. concluded his judgment with these words:

I further declare that upon execution of the
search warrant, the information in support
and the warrant are matters of Court
Record and are available for inspection on demand.

It is only fair to observe, however, that in
that case the person seeking access was an ""interested party"" and
therefore the broad declaration, quoted above, strictly speaking went beyond
what was required for the decision.

American courts have recognized a general right
to inspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records
and documents. Such common law right has been recognized, for example, in
courts of the District of Columbia (Nixon
v. Warner Communications, Inc. (1978), 98 S. Ct. 1306). In that case
Mr. Justice Powell, delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United
States, observed at p. 1311:

Both petitioner and respondents acknowledge
the existence of a common-law right of access to judicial records, but they
differ sharply over its scope and the circumstances warranting restrictions of
it. An infrequent subject of litigation, its contours have not been delineated
with any precision.

[page 183]

Later,
at p. 1312, Mr. Justice Powell said:

The interest necessary to support the
issuance of a writ compelling access has been found, for
example, in the citizen's desire to keep a watchful eye on the
workings of public agencies,
see, e.g., State ex rel. Colscott v. King, 154 Ind. 621, 621-627, 57 N.E. 535, 536-538 (1900); State ex
rel. Ferry v. Williams, 41 N.J.L. 332,
336-339 (1879), and in a newspaper publisher's intention to publish
information concerning the operation of government,
see, e.g., State ex rel. Youmans v. Owens, 28 Wis.2d 672, 677, 137 N.W.2d 470, 472 (1965), modified
on other grounds, 28 Wis.2d 685a, 139 N.W.2d 241 (1966). But see Burton v. Reynolds, 110 Mich. 354, 68 N.W. 217 (1896).

By
reason of the relatively few judicial decisions it is difficult, and probably
unwise, to attempt any comprehensive definition of the right of access to
judicial records or delineation of the factors to be taken into account in
determining whether access is to be permitted. The question before us is
limited to search warrants and informations. The response to that question, it
seems to me, should be guided by several broad policy considerations, namely,
respect for the privacy of the individual, protection of the administration of
justice, implementation of the will of Parliament that a search warrant be an
effective aid in the investigation of crime, and finally, a strong public
policy in favour of ""openness"" in respect of judicial acts. The
rationale of this last-mentioned consideration has been eloquently expressed by
Bentham in these terms:

'In the darkness of secrecy, sinister
interest and evil in every shape have full swing. Only in proportion as
publicity has place can any of the checks applicable to judicial injustice
operate. Where there is no publicity there is no justice.' 'Publicity is the
very soul of justice. It is the keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all
guards against improbity. It keeps the judge himself while trying under trial.'

The
concern for accountability is not diminished by the fact that the search
warrants might be issued by a justice in camera. On the contrary, this fact increases
the policy argument in favour of accessibility. Initial secrecy surrounding the
issuance of warrants may lead to abuse, and publicity

[page 184]

is a strong
deterrent to potential malversation.

In short, what
should be sought is maximum accountability and accessibility but not to the
extent of harming the innocent or of impairing the efficiency of the search
warrant as a weapon in society's never-ending fight against crime.

IV

The appellant, the
Attorney General of Nova Scotia, says in effect that the search warrants are
none of Mr. Maclntyre's business. MacIntyre is not directly interested in the
sense that his premises have been the object of a search. Why then should he be
entitled to see them?

There are two
principal arguments advanced in support of the position of the appellant. The
first might be termed the 'privacy' argument. It is submitted that the privacy
rights of the individuals who have been the object of searches would be
violated if persons like Mr. MacIntyre were permitted to inspect the warrants.
It is argued that the warrants are issued merely on proof of 'reasonable
grounds' to believe that there is evidence with respect to the commission of a
criminal offence in a ""building, receptacle or place"". At this stage
of the proceedings no criminal charge has been laid and there is no assurance
that a charge ever will be laid. Moreover, search warrants are often issued to
search the premises of a third party who is in no way privy to any wrongdoing,
but is in possession of material necessary to the inquiry. Why, it is asked,
submit these individuals to embarrassment and public suspicion through release
of search warrants?

The second,
independent, submission of the appellant might be termed the 'administration of
justice' argument. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the search warrant
procedure depends to a large extent on the element of surprise. If the occupier
of the premises were informed in advance of the warrant, he would dispose of
the goods. Therefore, the public must be denied access to the warrants,
otherwise the legislative purposes and

[page 185]

intention of Parliament, embodied in s. 443  of
the Criminal Code , would be
frustrated.

V

Let me deal first with the 'privacy' argument.
This is not the first occasion on which such an argument has been tested in the
courts. Many times it has been urged that the 'privacy' of litigants requires
that the public be excluded from court proceedings. It is now well established,
however, that covertness is the exception and openness the rule. Public
confidence in the integrity of the court system and understanding of the
administration of justice are thereby fostered. As a general rule the
sensibilities of the individuals involved are no basis for exclusion of the public
from judicial proceedings. The following comments of Laurence J. in R. v. Wright, 8 T.R. 293, are apposite
and were cited with approval by Duff J. in Gazette
Printing Co. v. Shallow (1909), 41 S.C.R. 339 at p. 359:

Though the
publication of such proceedings may be to the disadvantage of the particular individual
concerned, yet it is of vast importance to the public that the
proceedings of courts of justice
should be universally known. The general
advantage to the country in having these proceedings made public more
than counterbalances the inconveniences to
the private persons whose conduct may be the subject of such
proceedings.

The leading case is the decision of the House of
Lords in Scott v. Scott, [1913]
A.C. 417. In the later case of McPherson v.
McPherson, [1936] A.C. 177, at p. 200, Lord Blanesburgh, delivering
the judgment of the Privy Council, referred to ""publicity"" as the
""authentic hallmark of judicial as distinct from administrative
procedure"".

It is, of course, true that Scott v. Scott and McPherson v. McPherson were cases in
which proceedings had reached the stage of trial whereas the issuance of a
search warrant takes place at the pre-trial investigative stage. The cases
mentioned, however, and many others which could be cited, establish the broad
principle of ""openness"" in judicial proceedings, whatever their
nature, and in the exercise of judicial powers. The same policy considerations

[page 186]

upon which is
predicated our reluctance to inhibit accessibility at the trial stage are still
present and should be addressed at the pretrial stage. Parliament has seen fit,
and properly so, considering the importance of the derogation from fundamental
common law rights, to involve the judiciary in the issuance of search warrants
and the disposition of the property seized, if any. I find it difficult to
accept the view that a judicial act performed during a trial is open to public
scrutiny but a judicial act performed at the pretrial stage remains shrouded in
secrecy.

The reported cases
have not generally distinguished between judicial proceedings which are part of
a trial and those which are not. Ex parte applications
for injunctions, interlocutory proceedings, or preliminary inquiries are not
trial proceedings, and yet the 'open court' rule applies in these cases. The
authorities have held that subject to a few well-recognized exceptions, as in
the case of infants, mentally disordered persons or secret processes, all
judicial proceedings must be held in public. The editor of Halsbury's 4th Edition states the rule in these terms:

In general, all
cases, both civil and criminal, must be heard in open
court, but in certain exceptional cases, where
the administration of justice would be rendered impracticable by the presence of the public, the court may sit in
camera [Vol. 10, para. 705, at p. 316].

At every stage the
rule should be one of public accessibility and concomitant judicial
accountability; all with a view to ensuring there is no abuse in the issue of
search warrants, that once issued they are executed according to law, and
finally that any evidence seized is dealt with according to law. A decision by
the Crown not to prosecute, notwithstanding the finding of evidence appearing
to establish the commission of a crime may, in some circumstances, raise issues
of public importance.

In my view,
curtailment of public accessibility can only be justified where there is
present the need to protect social values of superordinate

[page 187]

importance. One of
these is the protection of the innocent.

Many search warrants
are issued and executed, and nothing is found. In these circumstances, does the
interest served by giving access to the public outweigh that served in
protecting those persons whose premises have been searched and nothing has been
found? Must they endure the stigmatization to name and reputation which would
follow publication of the search? Protection of the innocent from unnecessary
harm is a valid and important policy consideration. In my view that
consideration overrides the public access interest in those cases where a
search is made and nothing is found. The public right to know must yield to the
protection of the innocent. If the warrant is executed and something is seized,
other considerations come to bear.

VI

That brings me to
the second argument raised by the appellant. The point taken here is that the
effective administration of justice would be frustrated if individuals were
permitted to be present when the warrants were issued. Therefore, the
proceeding must be conducted in camera, as an
exception to the open court principle. I agree. The effective administration of
justice does justify the exclusion of the public from the proceedings attending
the actual issuance of the warrant. The Attorneys General have established, at
least to my satisfaction, that if the application for the warrant were made in
open court the search for the instrumentalities of crime would, at best, be
severely hampered and, at worst, rendered entirely fruitless. In a process in
which surprise and secrecy may play a decisive role the occupier of the
premises to be searched would be alerted, before the execution of the warrant,
with the probable consequence of destruction or removal of evidence. I agree
with counsel for the Attorney General of Ontario that the presence in an open
courtroom of members of the public, media personnel, and, potentially, contacts
of suspected accused in respect of whom the search is to be made, would

[page 188]

render the mechanism
of a search warrant utterly useless.

None of the counsel
before us sought to sustain the position of the Appeal Division of the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia that the issue of the search warrant is a judicial act
which should be performed in open court by a justice of the peace with the
public present. The respondent Mr. MacIntyre stated in paragraph 5 of his
factum:

One must note that the Respondent never
sought documentation relating to unexecuted
search warrants nor did he ever request to be present during the
decision making process .. .

It appeared clear during
argument that the act of issuing the search warrant is, in practice, rarely, if
ever, performed in open court. Search warrants are issued in private at all
hours of the day or night, in the chambers of the justice by day or in his home
by night. Section 443(1) of the Code seems to recognize the possibility
of exigent situations in stating that a justice may ""at any time""
issue a warrant.

Although the rule is
that of ""open court"" the rule admits of the exception referred to in Halsbury, namely, that in exceptional cases, where
the administration of justice would be rendered impracticable by the presence
of the public, the court may sit in camera. The
issuance of a search warrant is such a case.

In my opinion,
however, the force of the 'administration of justice' argument abates once the
warrant has been executed, i.e. after entry and search. There is
thereafter a ""diminished interest in confidentiality"" as the purposes
of the policy of secrecy are largely, if not entirely, accomplished. The need
for continued concealment virtually disappears. The appellant concedes that at
this point individuals who are directly 'interested' in the warrant have a
right to inspect it. To that extent at least it enters the public domain. The
appellant must, however, in some manner, justify granting access to the
individuals directly concerned, while denying access to the public in general.
I can find no compelling reason for distinguishing between

[page 189]

the occupier of the premises searched and the
public. The curtailment of the traditionally uninhibited accessibility of the
public to the working of the courts should be undertaken with the greatest
reluctance.

The 'administration of justice' argument is
based on the fear that certain persons will destroy evidence and thus deprive
the police of the fruits of their search. Yet the appellant agrees these very
individuals (i.e. those 'directly interested') have a right to see the warrant,
and the material upon which it is based, once it has been executed. The
appellants do not argue for blanket confidentiality with respect to warrants.
Logically, if those directly interested can see the warrant, a third party who
has no interest in the case at all is not a threat to the administration of
justice. By definition, he has no evidence that he can destroy. Concern for
preserving evidence and for the effective administration of justice cannot
justify excluding him.

Undoubtedly every court has a supervisory and
protecting power over its own records. Access can be denied when the ends of
justice would be subverted by disclosure or the judicial documents might be
used for an improper purpose. The presumption, however, is in favour of public
access and the burden of contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the
exercice of the right.

I am not unaware that the foregoing may seem a
departure from English practice, as I understand it, but it is in my view more
consonant with the openness of judicial proceedings which English case law
would seem to espouse.

VII

I conclude that the administration of justice
argument does justify an in camera proceeding at the time of issuance of
the warrant but, once the warrant has been executed, exclusion thereafter of
members of the public cannot normally be countenanced.

[page 190]

The general rule of
public access must prevail, save in respect of those whom I have referred to as
innocent persons.

I would dismiss the
appeal and vary the declaration of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia to read as follows:

IT IS DECLARED that after a search warrant
has been executed, and objects found as a result of the search are brought
before a justice pursuant to s. 446  of the Criminal Code , a member of the public is entitled to
inspect the warrant and the information upon which the warrant has been issued
pursuant to s. 443 of the Code.

There will be no costs in this Court.

The reasons of
Martland, Ritchie, Beetz and Estey JJ. were delivered by

MARTLAND
J. (dissenting)—T his appeal is from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia. The facts which gave rise to the case are not in dispute.

The appellant,
Ernest Harold Grainger, is Chief Clerk of the Provincial Magistrate's Court at
Halifax and is also a Justice of the Peace. The respondent is a television
journalist employed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation who, at the
material time, was researching a story on political patronage and fund raising.
He asked the appellant, Grainger, to show him certain search warrants and
supporting material and was refused on the ground that such material was not
available for inspection by the general public.

The respondent gave
notice to the appellants of an intended application in the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia, Trial Division, for ""an Order in the nature of mandamus
and/or a declaratory judgment to the effect that the search warrants and
Informations relating thereto issued pursuant to Section 443  of the Criminal
Code  of Canada or other related or similar statutes are a matter of public
record and may be inspected by a member of the public upon reasonable
request"".

[page 191]

The application was
heard by Richard J. who ordered that the respondent ""is entitled to a
declaration to the effect that the Search Warrants and Informations relating
thereto which have been executed upon and which are in the control of a Justice
of the Peace or a Court Official are court records and are available for
examination by members of the general public."" It will be noted that this
order was limited to search warrants which had been executed.

The appellants appealed
unsuccessfully to the Appeal Division. The judgment dismissing the appeal
contained the following declaration:

IT IS DECLARED
that a member of the public is entitled to
inspect informations upon which search warrants have been issued pursuant
to section 443  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

This declaration was
broader in its scope than that made by Richard J. in that it was not limited to
search warrants which had been executed. The basis for the Court's decision is
set forth in the following paragraph of the reasons for judgment:

In my opinion any
member of the public does have a right to inspect informations upon which search
warrants are based, pursuant to s. 443 
of the Criminal Code , since
the issue of the search warrant is a judicial act performed in open court by a
justice of the peace. The public would be entitled to be present on that
occasion and to hear the contents of the
information presented to the justice
when he is requested to exercise his discretion in the granting of the
warrant. The information has become part of the record of the court as revealed
at a public hearing and must be available for inspection by members of the
public.

Subsection (1) of s.
443  of the Criminal Code 
provides:

443. (1) A justice who is satisfied by information
upon oath in Form 1, that there is reasonable
ground to believe that there is in a building, receptacle or place

(a) anything upon or in respect of which any
offence against this Act has been or is
suspected to have been committed,

(b) anything that there is reasonable ground
to believe will afford evidence with respect
to the commission of an offence against this Act, or

[page 192]

(c) anything that there is reasonable ground
to believe is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any offence against the person for which a person
may be arrested without warrant,

may at any time issue a warrant under his
hand authorizing a person named therein or a
peace officer to search the building, receptacle or place for any such
thing, and to seize and carry it before the justice who issued the warrant or
some other justice for the same territorial division to be dealt with by him
according to law.

Section 446  of the Criminal Code  provides
that anything seized under a search warrant issued pursuant to s. 443  and
brought before a justice shall
be detained by him or he may
order that it be detained until the conclusion of any investigation or until
required to be produced for the purpose of a preliminary inquiry or trial.

Subsection (5) of s.
446  provides: 446... .

(5) Where anything is detained under
subsection (1), a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or of a
court of criminal jurisdiction may, on summary application on behalf of a
person who has an interest in what is detained, after three clear days notice
to the Attorney General, order that the person by or on whose behalf the
application is made be permitted to examine anything so detained.

The appellants, by
leave of this Court, have appealed from the judgments of the Appeal Division.
The two issues stated by the appellants are as follows:

(i) Are search warrants issued pursuant to
Section 443  of the Criminal Code  issued in open court and are they and
the informations pertaining thereto consequently documents open for public
inspection,

(ii) Whether there is otherwise a general
right to inspect search warrants and the informations pertaining thereto.

With respect to the
first issue, I am in agreement with my brother Dickson, for the reasons which
he has given, that the broad declaration made by the Appeal Division cannot be
sustained.

[page 193]

That being so, the respondent cannot assert a
right to examine the search warrants and the related informations on the basis
that the issuance of the search warrants was a judicial act in open court with
a right for the public to be present.

That brings us to the
second issue defined by the appellants as to whether there is a general right
to inspect search warrants and the informations pertaining thereto. This was
the real basis of the submission of the respondent who did not seek to sustain
the position taken by the Appeal Division. His position is that search warrants
issued under s. 443  and the informations pertaining thereto are court documents
which are open to general public inspection.

The respondent relies
upon an ancient English statute enacted in 1372, 46 Edward III. An English
translation of this Act, which was enacted in law French, appears in a note at
the end of the judgment of the Court of King's Bench in Caddy v. Barlow (1827), 1 Man. & Ry. 275 at pp. 279-80.
I will quote that part of the note which includes the statutory provision:

It appears that originally all judicial
records of the King's Courts were open to
the public without restraint, and were
preserved for that purpose. Lord Coke, in his preface to 3 Co. Rep. 3,
speaking on this subject says, ""these records, for that they contain great
and hidden treasure, are faithfully and safely kept, (as they well deserve), in the king's treasury. And yet not so
kept but that any subject may for his necessary use and benefit have
access thereunto; which was the ancient law of England, and so is declared by
an act of Parliament in 46
Edw. 3, in these words: Also the Commons pray, that, whereas
records, and whatsoever is in the King's Court, ought of reason to remain
there, for perpetual evidence and aid of all
parties thereto, and of all those whom
in any manner they reach, when they have need; and yet of late they
refuse, in the Court of our said Lord, to make search or exemplification of any
thing which can fall in evidence against the King, or in his disadvantage. May it please (you) to ordain by
statute, that search and
exemplification be made for all persons (fait as touts gentz) of whatever record touches them in any manner, as well as that which
falls against the King

[page 194]

as other persons. Le Roy le voet.""

The respondent cites this legislation in support
of the proposition that a member of the public has access to all judicial
records. However, the provisions of the statute did not go that far. It
referred to ""whatever record touches them in any manner"".
(Emphasis added.) I take this as meaning that to obtain the benefit of the
statute the person had to show that the document sought to be searched in some
way affected his interests.

This view is supported by the portion of the
footnote which precedes the quotation of the statute. Lord Coke states that any
subject may have access to the records ""for his necessary use and
benefit"".

The case of Caddy v. Barlow itself
related to the admissibility, in an action for malicious prosecution, of a copy
of an indictment against the plaintiff which had been granted to her brother,
the co-accused.

The respondent refers to the judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario in The Attorney-General v. Scully (1902),
4 O.L.R. 394, in which reference is made to Caddy v. Barlow and to the
English statute. That case dealt with an application made to the clerk of the
peace for a copy of the indictment in a criminal charge of theft against the
applicant who had been acquitted. He obviously had an interest in obtaining the
document.

The Appeal Division in the present case which,
as previously noted, based its decision to permit the examination of the search
warrants and informations upon its conclusion that these documents were
produced at a judicial hearing in open court, did deal with the assertion of a
general right to examine court documents in the following passage in its
reasons;

In my opinion at common law courts have
always exercised control over their process in open court and access to the records. Although the public have a
right to any information they may gleam [sic] from attendance at a public hearing of a process in open
court, and to those parts of the record that are part of the public
presentation of the judicial proceeding in open court

[page 195]

there have always been some parts of the
court file that are available only to ""persons interested"" and this
""interest"" must be established to the satisfaction of the court.
Parties to civil actions and the accused in criminal proceedings have always
been held by the courts to be persons so interested. Other persons must
establish their right to see particular documents before being entitled to do
so.

The
Appeal Division cited in its reasons paragraphs 1492 and 1493 of Taylor on Evidence, 11th ed. (The same
paragraphs appear with the same numbers in the 12th edition):

1492. It is highly questionable whether the records
of inferior tribunals are open to the inspection of all persons without
distinction; but it is clear that everyone has a right to inspect and take
copies of the parts of the proceedings in which he is individually interested.
The party, therefore, who wishes to examine any particular record of one of
those courts, should first apply to that court, showing that he has some
interest in the document in question, and that he requires it for a proper
purpose. 1f his application be refused, the Chancery, or the King's Bench
Division of the High Court, upon affidavit of the fact, may send either for the
record itself or an exemplification; or the latter court will, by mandamus,
obtain for the applicant the inspection or copy required. Thus, where a person,
after having been convicted by a magistrate under the game laws, had an action
brought against him for the same offence, the Court of Queen's Bench held that
he was entitled to a copy of the conviction; and the magistrate having refused
to give him one, they granted a writ of certiorari, for the mere purpose of
procuring a copy, and of thus enabling the defendant to defeat the action. So,
where a party, who had been sued in a court of conscience and had been taken in
execution, brought an action of trespass and false imprisonment, the judges
granted him a rule to inspect so much of the book of the proceedings as related
to the suit against himself.

1493. Indeed, it may be laid down as a
general rule, that the King's Bench Division will enforce by mandamus the
production of every document of a public nature, in which any one of his
Majesty's subjects can prove himself to be interested. Every officer,
therefore, appointed by law to keep records ought to deem himself a trustee for
all interested parties, and allow them to

[page 196]

inspect such documents as concern themselves,—without
putting them to the expense and trouble of making a formal application for a
mandamus. But the applicant must show that he has some direct and tangible
interest in the documents sought to be inspected, and that the inspection is bona fide required on some special and
public ground, or the court will not interfere in his favour; and therefore, if
his object be merely to gratify a rational curiosity, or to obtain information
on some general subject, or to ascertain facts which may be indirectly useful
to him in some ulterior proceedings, he cannot claim inspection as a right
capable of being enforced.

The
first edition of this work was published in 1848, and so these propositions may
be taken as representing the author's views of the law of
England on this subject.

In Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed., vol. 1, para.
97, a similar statement of the law appears:

The applicant's interest in the documents
must be direct and tangible. Neither curiosity, even though rational, nor the
ascertainment of facts which may be useful for furthering some ulterior object,
constitutes a sufficient interest to bring an applicant within the rule on
which the court acts in granting a mandamus for the inspection of public
documents.

Although reasonable grounds must be shown for
requiring inspection, it is not necessary to show as a ground for the
application for a mandamus to inspect documents that a suit has been actually
instituted. It will suffice to show that there is some particular matter in
dispute and that the applicant is interested therein.

It
is quite clear that the respondent has no direct and tangible interest in the
documents which he sought to examine. He wished to examine them to further an
ulterior object, i.e. for the purpose of
preparing a news story. Applying the rule applicable under English law, the
appellant, Grainger, was entitled to refuse his request.

It
is suggested that a broader right might be recognized consonant with the
openness of judicial proceedings. This suggestion requires a consideration of
the nature of the proceedings provided for in s. 443 . That section provides a
means whereby persons engaged in the enforcement of criminal law may obtain
leave, inter alia, to search buildings, receptacles
or places and seize documents or

[page 197]

other things which
may afford evidence with respect to the commission of a criminal offence. A
justice is empowered by the section to authorize this to be done. Before giving
such authority, he must be satisfied by information on oath that there is
reasonable ground for believing that there is in the building, receptacle or
place anything in respect of which an offence has been committed or is
suspected to have been committed; anything that there is reasonable ground to
believe will afford evidence of the commission of a criminal offence; or
anything that there is reasonable ground to believe is intended to be used for
the commission of an offence against the person for which a person may be
arrested without warrant.

The function of the
justice may be considered to be a judicial function, but might more properly be
described as a function performed by a judicial officer, since no notice is
required to anyone, there is no opposite party before him and, in fact, in the
case of a search before proceedings are instituted, no opposite party exists.
There is no requirement that the justice should perform his function in court.
The justice does not adjudicate, nor does he make any order. His power is to
give authority to do certain things which are a part of pretrial preparation by
the Crown. No provision is made in either s. 443  or s. 446  for an examination
by anyone of the documents on the basis of which the justice issued a search
warrant.

As the function of
the justice is not adjudicative and is not performed in open court, cases
dealing with the requirement of court proceedings being carried on in public,
such as Scott v. Scott, [1913] A.C. 417, and McPherson v. McPherson, [1936] A.C. 177, are not, in my opinion,
relevant to the issue before the Court. The documents which the respondent seeks
to examine are not documents filed in court proceedings. They are the necessary
requirements which enable the justice to grant permission for the Crown to
pursue its investigation of possible crimes and to prepare for criminal
proceedings.

[page 198]

If the documents in
question in this appeal are not subject to public examination prior to the
execution of the search warrants, I see no logical reason why they should
become subject to such examination thereafter, at least until the case in
respect of which the search has been made has come to trial. It is true that a
search of those documents before the search warrant has been executed might
frustrate the very purpose for which the warrant was issued by forewarning the
person whose premises were to be searched. The element of surprise is essential
to the proper enforcement of the criminal law. There are, however, additional
and important reasons why such documents should not be made public which
continue even after the warrant has been executed.

The information upon
oath on the basis of which a search warrant may be issued is in Form 1
contained in Part XXV of the Criminal Code . It requires a description of
the offence in respect of which the search is to be made. The informant must
state that he has reasonable grounds for believing that the things for which
the search is to be made are in a particular place and must state the grounds
for such belief. This document, which may be submitted to the justice before
any charges have been laid, discloses the informant's statement that an offence
has been committed or is intended to be committed.

The disclosure of
such information before trial could be prejudicial to the fair trial of the
person suspected of having committed such crime. Publication of such
information prior to trial is even more serious.

In R. v. Fisher (1811), 2 Camp. 563, 170 E.R. 1253, a prosecution was
instituted for criminal libel in consequence of the publication by the
defendants of the preliminary examinations taken ex parte before a
magistrate prior to the committal for trial of the plaintiff on a charge of
assault with intent to rape. In his judgment, Lord Ellenborough said, at p.
570:

If anything is more important than another in
the administration of justice, it is that jurymen should come to the trial of those persons on whose
guilt or innocence they are to decide,
with minds pure and unprejudiced. Is it
possible they should do so, after having read
for weeks

[page 199]

and months
before, ex parte statements of the evidence against the accused, which the
latter had no opportunity to disprove or to controvert? ... The
publication of proceedings in courts of justice, where both sides are heard,
and matters are finally determined, is salutary, and therefore it is permitted.
The publication of these preliminary
examinations has a tendency to pervert the public mind, and to disturb the course of justice; and it is
therefore illegal.

Inspection of the information and the search
warrant would enable the person inspecting the documents to discover the identity
of the informant. In certain types of cases this might well place the informant
in jeopardy. It was this kind of risk which led to the recognition in law of
the right of the police to protect from disclosure the identity of police
informants. That right exists even where a police officer is testifying at a
trial. The same kind of risk arises in relation to persons who give information
leading to the issuance of a search warrant. For the same reasons which justify
the police in refusing to disclose the identity of an informer, public
disclosure of documents from which the identity of the informant may be
ascertained should not be compelled.

In his reasons, my brother Dickson has referred
to the fact that in recent years the search warrant has become an increasingly
important investigatory aid as crime and criminals become increasingly
sophisticated and has pointed out that the effectiveness of a search pursuant
to a search warrant depends, inter alia, on the degree of confidentiality
which attends the issuance of the warrant. To insure such confidentiality, it
is essential that criminal organizations, such as those involved in the drug
traffic, should be prevented, as far as possible, from obtaining the means to
discover the identity of persons assisting the police.

Apart from the protection of the identity of the
person furnishing the information upon which the issuance of a search warrant
is founded, it is undesirable, in the public interest, that those engaged in
criminal activities should have available to them information which discloses
the pattern of police activities in connection with searches. In Inland Revenue Commissioners v.

[page 200]

Rossminster Ltd.,
[1980] 2 W.L.R. 1, the House of Lords considered the validity of a search
warrant procured pursuant to an English statute, the Taxes Management Act 1970, 1970 (U.K.), c. 9. The warrant was obtained because of suspected tax frauds. When executed,
the occupants of the premises were not told the offences alleged or the
""reasonable ground"" on which the judge issuing the warrant had acted.
In his reasons for judgment, Lord Wilberforce
said, at pp. 37-38:

But, on the plain words of the enactment, the
officers are entitled if they can persuade the board and the judge, to enter
and search premises regardless
of whom they belong to: a warrant which confers this power is strictly and
exactly within the parliamentary authority, and the occupier has no answer to
it. I accept that some information as regards the person(s) who are alleged to
have committed an offence and possibly as to the approximate dates of the offences must almost certainly have been
laid before the board and the judge. But the occupier
has no right to be told of this at this stage, nor has he the right to
be informed of the ""reasonable grounds"" of which the judge was
satisfied. Both courts agree as to this: all
this information is clearly protected by the public interest immunity
which covers investigations into possible criminal offences. With reference to
the police, Lord Reid stated this in these words:

""The police are carrying on an unending
war with criminals many of whom are today highly intelligent. So it is
essential that there should be no disclosure of anything which might give any
useful information to those who organise criminal activities. And it would
generally be wrong to require disclosure in a civil case of anything which
might be material in a pending prosecution: but after a verdict has been given
or it has been decided to take no proceedings there is not the same need for
secrecy."" (Conway v. Rimmer [1968] A.C. 910, at pp. 953-954.)

The release to the
public of the contents of informations and search warrants may also be harmful
to a person whose premises are permitted to be searched and who may have no
personal connection with the commission of the offence. The fact that his
premises are the subject of a search warrant generates suspicion that he was in
some way involved in the offence. Publication of

[page 201]

the fact that such a
warrant had been issued in respect of his premises would be highly prejudicial
to him.

For these reasons, I
am not satisfied that there is any valid reason for departing from the rule as
stated in Halsbury
(supra) so as to afford
to the general public the right to inspect documents forming part of the search
warrant procedure under s. 443 .

In summary, my
conclusion is that proceedings before a justice under s. 443  being part and
parcel of criminal investigative procedure are not analogous to trial
proceedings, which are generally required to be conducted in open court. The
opening to public inspection of the documents before the justice is not
equivalent to the right of the public to attend and witness proceedings in
court. Access to these documents should be restricted, in accordance with the practice
established in England, to persons who can show an interest in the documents
which is direct and tangible. Clearly the respondent had no such interest.

I would allow the
appeal and set aside the judgments of the Court of Appeal and of Richard J. In
accordance with the submission of the appellants, there should be no order as
to costs.

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally
by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—We do not need to hear you
Mr. MacKay. We regard s. 663(4)(a), (b) and (c)
as administrative provisions which are delegable, once the probation order is
made by the presiding judge. In this particular case, the accused was advised
of the consequences of a breach of the probation order by the Deputy Clerk and
indeed, on the facts, knew of the consequences. It was not necessary that he be
made aware by the judge personally. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

Judgment accordingly.

ON APPEAL FROM
THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR QUEBEC

Criminal Law — Trial — Election by accused
for a trial by judge and jury — Re-election for trial by judge alone — Whether
failure to comply with re-election procedure depriving court of jurisdiction —
Whether an accused may waive compliance with the procedural requirements of s.
492  of the Criminal Code  — Whether the accused did waive them — Waiver must be
clear and unequivocal — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 492.

Criminal law — Possession of heroin for the
purpose of trafficking — Non-compliance of trial judge with s. 8 procedure of
the Narcotic Control Act — Error of law — No waiver — Non-applicability of s.
613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  — New trial ordered — Narcotic Control Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1, s. 8 — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s.
613(1)(b)(iii).

Accused unsuccessfully appealed his
conviction of possessing heroin for the purpose of trafficking to the Quebec Court
of Appeal. The appeal to this Court was on two grounds: (1) the lack of
jurisdiction in the Court of the Sessions of the Peace to try the accused due
to the fact that he had not validly re-elected for a trial by judge alone and
(2) the trial judge's error in convicting the accused without offering him the
opportunity to address the issue of ""purpose"" after having made a
finding that he was in possession of the narcotic in light of the provisions of
s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

A party may waive a procedural requirement
enacted for his benefit. The validity of any waiver, however, is dependent upon
it being clear and unequivocal, i.e. that the person is waiving the
procedural safeguard and is doing so with full knowledge of the rights the
procedure was enacted to protect and of the effect the waiver will have on
those rights in the process. When considering

[page 42]

the circumstances surrounding the present case, the trial judge was justified to believe that there had been an informed waiver by the accused through his attorney
of the procedural requirements of
s. 492  of the Criminal Code .

The second ground
of appeal succeeded as the judge did not comply with the procedure set out in s.
8 of the Narcotic Control Act. Without valid waiver on the part of the accused, such non-compliance is fatal. The
denial of an opportunity of presenting a defence will always leave the court uncertain as to what would finally
be the evidence adduced had the
opportunity denied been given the
accused. Section 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  cannot apply where the
provisions of s. 8  have not been complied with.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec dismissing the appellant's appeal from his conviction on a charge of
possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking. Appeal allowed.

Paul Skolnick and Ivan Lerner, for the
appellant.

Jacques Letellier, for the respondent.

The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

LAMER
J.—The appellant, one Tibor Korponay, was found
guilty of possession of 5 kilos of heroin for the purpose of trafficking (s.
4(2) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. N-1) by a judge of the Sessions of the Peace, sitting in the judicial
district of Montreal as a judge under Part XVI of the Criminal Code .

Korponay's appeal to
the Quebec Court of Appeal was dismissed and he now comes to this Court on two
grounds: his first ground is that, having chosen originally a trial by jury,
the Court that convicted him did not have jurisdiction to do so because he had
not been properly put to a

[page 43]

re-election to the
latter court under s. 492  of the Criminal Code ; his second ground is
predicated on the provisions of s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act which
require that the court conducting a trial for an offence contrary to s. 4(2) of
the Narcotic Control Act proceed in determining the guilt or innocence
of an accused in two phases. The appellant argues that the trial judge did not
proceed in compliance with the special procedure set out in s. 8 , in that he
did not make a finding as to possession and then give the accused an
opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the narcotic for
the purpose of trafficking, and that, as a result, a new trial should be
ordered. Appellant's first ground should not in my opinion succeed. However, as
I am of the view that his second should, the issue raised by the first ground
must nevertheless be decided as it is determinant of which court will have
jurisdiction to hear the new trial that should in my opinion be ordered.

First ground

Korponay had
elected, under s. 484(2) of the Code, to be tried by a court composed of
a judge and jury. Following a preliminary inquiry he was, on September 22,
1972, committed for trial before the Superior Court of Criminal Jurisdiction.

Korponay, who was on
bail, appeared before that Court on November 6, 1972, and his case was remanded
from one assize to the other the last of such remands being to November 22,
1974.

However, on November
6, 1974, we find Korponay, assisted by two attorneys, appearing before the
Chief Judge of another court, the Court of the Sessions of the Peace, in
Montreal. The relevance of this occurrence will become apparent later. The
Clerk of that Court had the Superior Court's record and, in the presence of
all, including the Crown Attorney, read the charge to Korponay. What then
happened is best described by reproducing here the transcript of the
proceedings:

(S) GRACE LIBERATORE

(S) THÉRÈSE
PELLETIER

The trial commenced
on the date of that appearance before the Chief Judge by the reading into the
record by consent of evidence adduced in other proceedings, against other
persons involved in the events that gave rise to the charge against Korponay.
The trial appears to have continued piece-meal on many occasions over the next
three years. After the Crown finally closed its case, Korponay offered a
defence and testified on his own behalf on May 5, 1977. On August 3 of the same
year, Chief Judge Mayrand found him guilty and, on September 23, 1977 sentenced
him to 14 years in the penitentiary.

It was not until
October 19, 1979, some two years later, that the appellant, in a petition for a
writ of habeas corpus, questioned for the first time since the beginning
of his trial in the Court of the Sessions of the Peace that Court's
jurisdiction to try him.

This appeal is not
concerned with those proceedings but with the appeal from his conviction. His
first ground alleges a lack of jurisdiction in the Court of the Sessions of the
Peace to try him due to the fact that he had not validly re-elected for a trial
by judge alone, and that the only court having jurisdiction for doing so was
the court he had initially chosen, the Superior Court. Korponay says that the provisions set out in s. 492  for re-electing are
mandatory, must be complied with strictly, and that substantial compliance with
the provisions of that section is not sufficient to confer upon the court jurisdiction to try him.

[page 47]

Section 492  reads as follows:

492. (1) Where an accused has elected or is
deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, the
accused may notify the sheriff in the territorial division in which he is to be
tried that he desires to re-elect under this section,

(a) to be tried by a judge without a jury; or

(b) if he has the consent in writing of the
Attorney General or counsel acting on his behalf, to be tried by a magistrate
without a jury.

(2) A sheriff who receives a notice and a
consent, if required, pursuant to subsection (1) shall forthwith inform a judge
or magistrate having jurisdiction and the judge or magistrate, as the case may
be, shall fix a time and place for the accused to re-elect and shall cause
notice thereof to be given to the accused,

(3) The accused shall attend or, if he is in
custody, shall be produced at the time and place fixed under subsection (2) and
shall, after the charge upon which he has been committed for trial or ordered
to stand trial has been read to him,

(a) if the notice states that the accused
desires to re-elect to be tried by a judge without a jury, be put to his
election in the following words:

You have elected or are deemed to have
elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. Do you now elect to
be tried by a judge without a jury?;

or

(b) if the notice states that the accused
desires to re-elect to be tried by a magistrate without a jury, be put to his
election in the following words:

You have elected or are deemed to have
elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, Do you now elect
to be tried by a magistrate without a jury?

(4) Where an accused elects under this
section to be tried by a judge without a jury or a magistrate without a jury,
the judge or magistrate, as the case may be, shall proceed with the trial or
fix a time and place for the trial.

(5) Where an accused who desires to re-elect
to be tried by a judge without a jury does not notify the sheriff in accordance
with subsection (1) more than fourteen days before the day fixed for the
opening of the sittings or session of the court sitting with a jury by which he
is to be tried, no election may be made under

[page 48]

this section unless the Attorney General or
counsel acting on his behalf consents in writing.

The appellant says
that no notice was given by him to the sheriff, that no notice was given him by
the judge, and that he was not read the words set out in s. 492(3)(a). He
concludes that, this not having been done, the judge did not have the
jurisdiction to proceed to trial as he did.

All of appellant's
arguments in his factum and before this Court related to whether there was or
was not strict compliance with the section and were then in support of a
requirement for strict compliance.

In my view there was
no compliance with the section at all, not even substantial compliance, and the
issue whether there must be strict or need only be substantial compliance is of
no relevance to the determination of this case. What the procedures followed in
this case raise as an issue is whether an accused may waive compliance with the
procedural requirements set out in the section, if so, in what manner, and
whether the accused in this case did waive them.

Some procedural
requirements are enacted for the protection of the rights of one of the
parties, Crown and accused, and others for both. A party may waive a procedural
requirement enacted for his benefit, the concurrence of both being required
when enacted for both. Generally speaking, the right to waive that type of
procedural requirement has been recognized by all the courts, including this
Court, and has been recently reaffirmed by this Court's decision as regards the
waiver of a voir dire into the circumstances surrounding the
giving of a statement by an accused to a person in authority (see Park v. The Queen, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 64). Paramount to such a right is that of the trial
judge to require compliance notwithstanding a desire to waive, he being the
ultimate judge of what procedural safeguards need nevertheless be respected in
order to protect the certainty and the integrity of the judicial process.

[page 49]

When one looks at
the various cases dealing with waiver, the problem which presents itself
relates to what formalities should surround a waiver before the court should
accept it and give it effect, in order that it will be a bar to the party
seeking to assert a non-compliance with the procedural requirement.

As a general
proposition, I should like to restate here what was said by our brother Dickson
J., speaking for the Court, in Park, supra. He was of course speaking of
the waiver by counsel of a voir dire [at pp.
73-74]:

No particular words or formula need be
uttered by defence counsel to express the
waiver and admission. All that is necessary is that the trial judge be
satisfied that counsel understand the matter and has made an informed decision
to waive the voir dire. [...]

Although no particular form of words is
necessary the waiver must be express. Silence or mere lack of objection does
not constitute a lawful waiver. The question is—does the accused indeed waive
the requirement of a voir dire and admit that the statement is voluntary
and admissible in evidence? If that
question can be answered in the affirmative I cannot think that any
further procedural safeguards are necessary to protect the rights of an accused
person.

Indeed the Court is saying in Park that the validity
of such a waiver, and I should add that that is so of any waiver, is dependent
upon it being clear and unequivocal that the person is waiving the procedural
safeguard and is doing so with full knowledge of the rights the procedure was
enacted to protect and of the effect the waiver will have on those
rights in the process. This has long been recognized, as is illustrated by
many cases, and particularly so by those dealing with a judge's duties as
regards a plea of guilty, which is the waiver by an accused of his right to put
the Crown's case to the test of a trial. (See amongst others, Adgey v. The
Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 426; Brosseau v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 181). The
judge's duties concerning any waiver are no different than those on a plea of
guilty. The factors he will take into account in determining whether the
accused has clearly and unequivocally made an informed decision to waive his
rights will vary

[page 50]

depending on the
nature of the procedural requirement being waived and the importance of the
right it was enacted to protect. However, always relevant will be the fact that
the accused is or is not represented by counsel, counsel's experience, and, in
my view of great importance in a country so varied as ours, the particular
practice that has developed in the jurisdiction where the events are taking
place.

I will now consider
those principles as they apply to the procedural requirements of s. 492 .

First let us look at
the notice that an accused may give to the sheriff. To identify the right of
the accused Parliament intended to protect through this procedure one must look
at the purpose of the notice. That purpose is revealed by the fact that it
creates an obligation upon the sheriff to ""forthwith inform"" the
judge who in turn ""shall fix a time and place for the accused to
re-elect"" and then ""cause notice thereof to be given to the
accused"".

The right to be
protected by the procedural enactment is that of the accused, wishing to
re-elect, to have a timely opportunity to do so. He is entitled to have the
judge informed of his wish, and thus require the judge to act under the
section. An accused who has in fact acted on that opportunity cannot later
complain that the notice requirement needed waiver by him as it obviously, in
those circumstances, no longer had any purpose.

As for the notice
that the judge must give the accused, it is to ensure that he will know where
and when to attend to re-elect. An accused who does in fact agree to a time and
place to attend would clearly and unequivocally be waiving that notice.

The procedural step set out in s. 492(3),
requiring the use of certain words, is there to ensure that an accused is
properly informed of the choice he has made and the one he now proposes to
adopt. His alternatives in the case at bar would be trial by a court composed
of a judge and jury, which he has formerly chosen, or trial by judge or
magistrate

[page 51]

alone, which he then contemplated. An informed
waiver must therefore be, as regards that portion of s. 492 , a clear and
unequivocal indication by the accused himself or through his counsel that he
knows the words that the law says must be used when putting him to his
re-election, that he does not require that those words be uttered to him, that
he knows he was going to have a trial before a judge and jury, that he still
has the right to such a trial but that he still has the right to re-elect for a
trial before a judge sitting without a jury or a magistrate.

Now to apply these
considerations to the facts of the present case.

The events took
place in the judicial district of Montreal. Pursuant to questions by this Court
at the hearing, attorney for the appellant acknowledged the existence of a
practice particular to that district as regards re-election. (See: Traité de
procédure pénale,
vol. 1, 1981,
by Béliveau, Bellemare and Lussier, at pp. 302-308). As appears from that book,
an accused, who has elected for a trial by jury and who wishes to re-elect for
a trial by judge alone, does not advise the sheriff of same but rather a
particular clerk of the court who is known as being currently the person
responsible for re-elections. If the re-election is to be made at a date prior
to the date the accused was told to be present before the Assizes Court at his
last appearance before that Court, that clerk, having been so advised by
accused's counsel, arranges for an appearance before the Chief Judge of the
Court of the Sessions of the Peace (or any judge replacing him for that
purpose) for re-election. This is usually done in the absence of the Crown
Prosecutor who is handling the case, unless there is some special reason for
his being present, such as a plea of guilty followed by pre-sentence
representations, or evidently unless, as in this case, the trial is to commence
at that time by the reading into the record of evidence already adduced in
other procedures.

That this be the
practice in the judicial district of Montreal, appellant does not contest. He
questions

[page 52]

however the validity of that practice as not
being in accordance with s. 492 . In this case, the accused with his attorney,
the Crown attorney and the clerk were in the Court of the Sessions of the Peace
before the Chief Judge of that Court. The record, which was the Superior
Court's record by virtue of the appellant's original election, had been brought
to that Court and the clerk had read the charge to Korponay and asked him
whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty. To that, the accused's attorney
replied ""judge alone"". It is clear from the exchange that ensued that
the Crown, and probably the court clerk, were under the mistaken impression
that the accused had already re-elected to that Court and was there to commence
the trial, which is what eventually happened.

It is equally clear that appellant's attorney
and appellant himself were there to commence the trial before that Court and
that the attorney for the appellant, being of the view, and rightly so, that
there had not been a re-election, indicated to the judge in his client's name
that he wanted to be tried by a judge alone. The judge had before him an
attorney whose knowledge of the law and of the practice of the criminal law
does not appear to be in issue. He was, in my view, amply justified in
assuming, since everyone was there to proceed with the trial, that the attorney
had discussed the matter with Korponay and that Korponay made an informed
decision, on the advice of his attorney, to proceed to trial, not before a jury,
but before that judge sitting without a jury, and that the attorney was fully
authorized to do anything necessary to that end. The judge was therefore in my
view amply justified in considering that the attorney's saying ""judge
alone"" was an informed waiver of the requirement of putting to his client
the words of the section. The accused's attorney knew what those words were, he
knew what they meant and what effect his answer ""judge alone"" would
have on his client's rights. Also, I should like to make my own the words of
Monnin J. A. when, speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba in the case of R. v.
Matheson (1979), 13 C.R. (3d)
62, (the decision was reversed by this Court[1]

[page 53]

but for reasons irrelevant to the passage that I
am quoting with approval), he said (at p. 71):

I am of the view that what the accused can
personally do counsel speaking on his behalf and in his presence can likewise do; otherwise we are diminishing the
role of counsel and making a mockery of open trials solemnly conducted
in the presence of the accused fully represented by counsel of his choice. It
is certainly more expeditious and free from doubt to let a person who is
trained and learned in the law inform the court of the election and the plea of the accused, providing it is done in
open court and in the hearing of the accused, rather that [sic] to
insist that a slow and tedious trial ritual be accomplished only through the
mouth of the accused, who may not fully understand the questions raised and who may be hesitant to reply for fear of
misunderstanding or mistake. Counsel has a role to play in the
courtroom. He should be able to play it to the fullest.

This is a case of a clear and unequivocal waiver
by the accused through his attorney of the uttering of the words set out in the
section. The attorney thought the accused had not re-elected, was right in
thinking so and did re-elect for the purpose of getting on with what everyone
was there to do: start the trial. As for his ""notice"" to the sheriff,
I think that what I have already said on the matter is sufficient. He was being
offered the choice the notice was enacted to ensure, and that procedure would
have been superfluous and needed not be waived.

This also disposes of notice from the judge. In
any event it is also evident that all there had agreed to a time, place and
purpose, and that it would be extravagant to even suggest that there was not a
clear and unequivocal waiver of that requirement.

This ground should therefore fail. 

Second ground

This ground concerns the procedure set out in s.
8 of the Narcotic Control Act:

[page 54]

8. In any prosecution for a violation of
subsection 4(2), if the accused does not plead guilty, the trial shall proceed
as if it were a prosecution for an offence under section 3, and after the close
of the case for the prosecution and after the accused has had an opportunity to
make full answer and defence, the court shall make a finding as to whether or
not the accused was in possession of the narcotic contrary to section 3; if the
court finds that the accused was not in possession of the narcotic contrary to
section 3, he shall be acquitted but if the court finds that the accused was in
possession of the narcotic contrary to section 3, he shall be given an
opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the narcotic for
the purpose of trafficking, and thereafter the prosecutor shall be given an
opportunity of adducing evidence to establish that the accused was in
possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking; if the accused
establishes that he was not in possession of
the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, he shall be acquitted of
the offence as charged but he shall be convicted of an offence under section 3
and sentenced accordingly; and if the accused fails to establish that he was
not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, he shall be
convicted of the offence as charged and sentenced accordingly.

After the Crown closed its case, Korponay, on
May 5, 1977, testified and then closed his defence. The trial judge set August
3 for judgment. On that date, Korponay and three other accused, who had been
charged on different records with two counts, conspiracy to traffic in a
narcotic, and trafficking, appeared before him for judgment. Korponay had been
tried separately. Evidence adduced at the trials of the others had been read
into Korponay's trial. The trial judge was pronouncing judgment of all four
accused on the same day for they were all part of the same illegal transaction though
charged differently and not tried with Korponay. This is of some relevance in
understanding what I consider to be but an unfortunate oversight on the judge's
part, he being well cognizant of the exceptional procedure to be followed on a
trial governed by s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act. In a written
judgment, which he read, he concluded by finding all of them guilty as charged.
He had evidently momentarily overlooked the special position Korponay was in
and as a result did not in any way comply with the procedure set out in s. 8,
make a

[page 55]

finding as to
possession (evidently affirmative), and then offer him the opportunity to
address the issue of ""purpose"".

Though raised in the
Court of Appeal, this ground was in no way addressed or even mentioned by that
court. Having dealt with the ground related to the re-election procedure Nolan
J.A., speaking for the Court, reviewed the evidence and then said (A.C. at p.
2789):

In my opinion the Appellant has failed to
justify his grounds of appeal. The Crown,
in my view, has proven Appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and I
would therefore dismiss the appeal.

Both counsel agreed
that this was an unfortunate oversight. I agree, all the more so as it was not
only a serious ground but in my opinion one that should have succeeded.

Appellant argues
essentially that the procedure set out in s. 8 is mandatory and seeks support
for that proposition in the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision in R. v. McDonald (1958), 120 C.C.C. 209. He further says that non-compliance is fatal and
that the provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) cannot be invoked, and, to that end,
he relies on this Court's decision in Cloutier v.
The Queen, [19791 2
S.C.R. 709.

Respondent says that
the McDonald decision must be read in the light of the peculiar
facts of the case as was done by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Sharpe (1961),
131 C.C.C. 75, and later by the Court of Appeal of Quebec in R. v. Sylvain (1974), 17 C.C.C. (2d) 323. In essence, respondent relies on the Sharpe and Sylvain cases
to argue that there is no reason why, given the proper circumstances, as those
courts felt was the case in those two instances, the curative provisions of s.
613(1) (b)(iii) cannot be applied.

[page 56]

Section
613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code 

Respondent says
that, as Korponay was de facto given the opportunity to offer an explanation and did offer one as to the
purpose of his possession, the provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) could and in
this case should be applied.

This to me is, with
deference, a misunderstanding of the rights of an accused at a trial governed
by s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act.

Under s. 8, the
rights of an accused are fourfold:

—a trial conducted during the first phase
as if the charge were one under s. 3;

—a full answer and defence to the issue of
possession before being put in actual jeopardy of conviction of an
offence under s. 4(2);

—a finding on possession before
deciding on a defence and revealing its nature as regards the purpose of that
possession in the event that finding be affirmative;

—an opportunity of presenting that defence.

The respondent—Crown
is saying that a breach of the accused's right to a finding by the judge before
addressing the issue of the purpose of his possession is necessarily cured by
the accused having in fact been given at some time prior to that finding an
opportunity to address the issue and by his having availed himself of that
opportunity.

The accused's right
is not limited to that of being given an opportunity of establishing that the
purpose of his possession was not trafficking; were that the case, I would
agree with the Crown that the accused having testified as to that aspect of the
offence, s. 613(1) (b)(iii) could, given the proper circumstances, be applied
and cure the oversight with respect to the second stage of s. 8.

[page 57]

Such is not however
the case because most important is the additional right of an accused to avail
himself of that opportunity, or decide not to, only after having been given the
trier of fact's finding as to possession and only if that finding is adverse.
The question therefore, as regards the application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii), is whether the
Crown has discharged the burden of satisfying the court that even if the
accused had known that the finding would be adverse to him his defence would
have been necessarily the same. I find it difficult to imagine a court ever
being so satisfied. Indeed, an accused's whole approach to his case might well
be very different at that second stage of the proceedings. Let me illustrate.
An accused is perfectly entitled, by his not testifying himself in his own
defence though offering a defence at the first stage of the proceedings, to
refrain from revealing an addiction to drugs which could be incriminating as
regards possession. He might however want to establish that fact at the second
stage of the proceedings when contending that the purpose of his possession was
for personal consumption. This example illustrates the general proposition that
a court cannot know that a defence after the finding would necessarily have
been the same as that advanced before and conclude that there was ""no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice"".

In my view, the
curative provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) can never succeed in face of this type of error. Such
non-compliance with the section will be fatal unless there has been a valid
waiver on the part of the accused. Though Parliament has not put any error of
law beyond the reach of s. 613(1) (b)(iii), certain types of errors of law are such that the Crown will never succeed
in satisfying the court that, had it not been for the error, the verdict would
of necessity have been the same.

Such is the type of
error in the present case. Indeed the denial of an opportunity of presenting a
defence will always leave the court uncertain as to

[page 58]

what would finally
be the evidence adduced had the opportunity denied been given the accused.

Appellant's reliance
on this Court's decision in Cloutier was predicated on what was said by
Pratte J. (at p. 724):

The accused, who is erroneously denied a
peremptory challenge, is entitled to
ask that the trial and the guilty verdict
returned by an irregularly empanelled jury be
annulled; it is not necessary for him
to prove a prejudice; there is a 'préjudice de droit'; as to this no
doubt exists: R. v. Churton (1919), 31 C.C.C. 188; Henry Williams
(1925), 19 Cr. App. R. 67; R. v. Page, [1965] Crim. L.R.
444.

This passage is obiter. In
any event, to the extent that Pratte J. could be interpreted as suggesting that
the irregular empanelling of a jury is an error of law which may never be cured
by the application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii), I cannot, with deference, agree. But I
do agree with the appellant that such is the error in the present case. And, as
I have said, the fatal effect on the trial of non-compliance in the present
case can only be avoided if there be a valid waiver.

Waiver

Though waiver was
not commented on by either party to the proceedings, the issue of waiver must
nevertheless be addressed, as it is determinative of this appeal.

When considered in
the perspective of waiver the question to be addressed is the following: has an
accused waived his right to a ""finding"" and to then presenting anew a
defence on the issue of ""purpose"" by the mere fact that he has already
addressed that issue at the first stage?

I need not repeat
here, when considering s. 8, what 1 have said earlier as regards the criterion
for determining the existence and validity of a waiver, except to repeat that
it must be informed, clear and unequivocal.

Two cases relied
upon by respondent in support of an application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) and which,
it is true, were in fact decided on that basis, in my

[page 59]

view offer
illustrations of circumstances where valid waivers had in fact been made, and
for that reason, though disagreeing as to the propriety of resorting to s.
613(1) (b)(iii), I find myself in agreement with the result: R. v. Sylvain, supra, which is the waiver of the ""finding"", and R. v. Sharpe, supra, which is different, being the waiver of adducing evidence after the
finding.

In Sylvain, the
accused testified at the first stage; at the outset he admitted possession and
then addressed the issue of ""purpose"" before the judge made a finding
as to his possession. The Court of Appeal of Quebec dismissed the appeal by
applying s. 613(1) (b)(iii). As I said earlier, I do not think that s. 613 can
have any application where the provisions of s. 8 have not been complied with.
But, the fact that Sylvain, assisted by his attorney, and in answer to questions
by his attorney, started by admitting possession and then dealt directly with
""purpose"" was, in the circumstances of that case, in my opinion, a
clear and unequivocal waiver of his right to a ""finding"" on
possession by the judge before testifying as to purpose.

The Sharpe case
appears to have been decided by the Court of Appeal for Ontario by resorting to
a combination of ""waiver"" and the provisions of s. 613. Sharpe had
testified at the first stage. What then happened is best described by the Court
of Appeal per Morden J.A. (at p. 80):

In the case at bar the Magistrate was well
aware of the provisions of s. 4(4). After
hearing counsel on the issue of possession, he made a finding that the
appellant was guilty of possession. It was
at that point he turned to the issue of trafficking and heard argument. The
record does not show that he specifically
advised the accused of his
right to give or call evidence on this issue. However, I assume
that the counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial (who was not his
counsel in this Court), knew the correct procedure and if he had
evidence he wished to call on the issue of
trafficking, he would have so advised the Magistrate and it would have
been received. In view of the appellant's denial of possession,
it would be difficult to imagine what
evidence he himself

[page 60]

could have given on the issue of trafficking.
At very most, the Magistrate's failure to ask whether defence wished to call
evidence at this stage was an irregularity and
in view of his counsel's acquiescence, it could not be a ground for allowing this appeal. As Lord Goddard
C.J. said in R. v. Neal, [1949] 2 K.B.
590 at p. 597: ""We desire, however, to emphasize that if an irregularity
arises in a trial which can be cured, and it is not brought timeously to the
attention of the court of trial, it does not by any means follow that this
court will allow advantage to be taken of it when it is too late to remedy it
except by quashing the conviction.""

See also R. v. Lashbrooke (1958), 43 Cr. App. R. 86.

When the finding of possession was made
against the appellant, then s. 4(4) imposed
an onus upon him to establish by a balance of probabilities that he was not in possession for the purpose of trafficking. He did
not call evidence on this issue. He was entitled to rely upon the
evidence already given and if that evidence as a whole raised a reasonable
doubt then he would have been entitled to have been acquitted: R. v. Cappello, supra. In my opinion,
the quantity of narcotics found in his possession
and their value and the fact that the appellant was not an addict, left
no room for reasonable doubt of his guilt and the Magistrate did not err when
he convicted the appellant of having in his possession a drug for the purpose
of trafficking.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the
appeal. 

(The underlining is mine.)

The fact that the
attorney did not, after the affirmative finding as to possession, call
any evidence but rather proceeded immediately to present his arguments as
regards ""purpose"" could, in that case, be considered a waiver of the
accused's right to adduce, anew, evidence on the issue of purpose. If and to
the extent the Court of Appeal for Ontario is predicating its conclusion
on the presence of a valid waiver, I agree. I should not, however, with deference,
for reasons already set out, agree with what appears to be an application of
s. 613(1) (b)(iii) by speculating as to whether the accused could and would
have added anything

[page 61]

else to his defence
had he exercised his right to do so after a ""finding"".

The present case is
different from Sharpe in that there was no finding. It differs
from Sylvain in that the accused did not admit
possession. There is no basis, when applying the proper criterion, for
concluding that there was a waiver of the ""finding"", as in Sylvain, or of the calling of further evidence as in Sharpe. There being no waiver, we have here an error of
law, non-compliance with s. 8, that cannot, as I said, be dealt with under s.
613(1) (b)(iii). This ground of appeal should therefore in my view succeed and a
new trial should be ordered.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Evidence—Statements against
penal interest—Hearsay—Exception to the hearsay rule—Whether such statements
having an inculpatory effect on the accused admissible.

Accused was charged with arson in the burning
of his house. A friend of the accused, who was severely burned and died a few
days later, made two statements at the hospital to R.C.M.P. officers admitting
that he had personally set the house afire and had been hired by the accused to
do so. At trial, the statements were admitted into evidence and the accused
convicted. An appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

In a proper case, statements tendered on
behalf of the accused and made by an unavailable person may be admitted at
trial if they can be shown to have been made against the penal interest of the
person making them; but such a rule could not apply to statements which have an
inculpatory effect on the accused. Such statements implicating the accused robs
him of the invaluable weapon of cross-examination which has always been one of
the mainstays of fairness in our courts.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba
(1979), 1 Man. R. (2d) 182, 50 C.C.C. (2d) 535, dismissing an appeal from a
judgment of Darichuk J. Appeal allowed.

Paul Walsh, for the appellant.

Stuart Whitley, for the respondent.

[Page 29]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought as of right
pursuant to s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  and is
accordingly limited to the questions of law on which Mr. Justice
O’Sullivan dissented in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. The said s. 618
(1) (a) reads as follows:

618. (1) A
person who is convicted of an indictable offence and whose conviction is
affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

(a) on any question of law on which
a judge of the court of appeal dissents,…

The grounds of appeal are referred to in the
following terms in the notice of appeal to this Court:

AND FURTHER TAKE NOTICE that the grounds of the
said appeal are the grounds in law set forth by The Honourable Mr. Justice
O’Sullivan of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, in his dissent from the
Judgment of the said Court of Appeal for Manitoba which said grounds of dissent
in law are more particularly set out in the Reasons for Judgment of the said
The Honourable Mr. Justice O’Sullivan in the formal Certificate of
Decision of the said Court of Appeal for Manitoba, namely:

1. THAT the learned trial Judge erred in
law in permitting the introduction into evidence of a confession/statement by a
deceased person accusing an accused, as an exception to the rule against
hearsay evidence; and

2. THAT the learned trial Judge erred in
law assuming the said confession/statement implicating the accused were admissable
[sic], in admitting into evidence such portion of the said statement
which was an accusation directed against the accused.

The appellant was convicted at trial by His
Honour Judge W. Darichuk in the County Court Judges’ Criminal Court for the Dauphin
Judicial District on the following charge, namely:

THAT he the said ARMAND LUCIER on or about
the ninth day of November in the year of our Lord one thousand, nine hundred
and seventy-seven at or near the Rural Municipality of Shell River in the Dauphin
Judicial District, in the Province of Manitoba, did unlawful-

[Page 30]

ly and wilfully set fire to a building, to
wit: a dwelling house, the property of Armand Lucier.

The appellant’s appeal from this conviction was
dismissed in a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba and it is from this
judgment that the appeal is now taken on the grounds referred to above which
are more fully set forth in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice
O’Sullivan.

The facts of this case are essentially
undisputed and reveal that the appellant’s house was destroyed by fire at a
time when he was absent from the locality and shortly after he had increased
his fire insurance policy by the sum of $20,000. The circumstances immediately
preceding this fire are recounted by the appellant’s friend, one Dumont, who
had himself been in the house at the time of the fire with the result that he
was seriously burned and upon escaping to his sister’s house nearby he was
ultimately removed to a hospital in Winnipeg. There he was visited by a
constable of the R.C.M.P to whom he made a statement admitting that he had
personally set the house afire and that he had been hired to do so for the
purpose by the appellant who had undertaken to pay him $500 for the task.
Dumont later made a further statement to another R.C.M.P. officer which was to
the same effect in that he admitted responsibility for setting the fire and
implicated the accused in the undertaking. Both these statements were made to
persons in authority after Dumont had been duly cautioned and they were in my
view contrary to his penal interest. A few days later Dumont died and it is the
question of whether or not his statements should be admitted against the
appellant which lies at the root of this appeal. After a careful review of the
leading cases on the somewhat vexed question as to the admissibility of
statements made against penal interest, the Court of Appeal concluded that the
Dumont statements were admissible.

It is, of course, obvious that the account given
by the policemen of what Dumont had told them was hearsay evidence and in fact
it might be characterized as double hearsay in that it constituted the
policemen’s recollection of what the deceased said about what was said to him
by the

[Page 31]

appellant concerning the lighting of the fire.
The rule against the admission of hearsay evidence has been constantly repeated
over the years and is succinctly stated by Lord Norman in Teper v. The
Queen, [1952] A.C. 480, at p. 486 where he said:

The rule against the admission of hearsay
evidence is fundamental. It is not the best evidence and it is not delivered on
oath. The truthfulness and accuracy of the person whose words are spoken to by
another witness cannot be tested by cross-examination, and the light which his
demeanour would throw on his testimony is lost.

The Sussex Peerage case, decided in 1844 (1844), 11 Cl. and Fin. 85, 8 E.R. 1034
(H.L.), recognized an exception to the hearsay rule in respect of a statement
made by a deceased person against his pecuniary interest, but this exception
did not apply to a statement against penal interest. The advisability of
extending the application of the exception to declarations against penal
interest has been debated in a number of cases and by Wig-more in his text on
evidence (5 Wigmore, Evidence, 3rd ed., paras. 1476 and 1477).
However, the matter has been determined in this Court in R. v. O’Brien, [1978]
1 S.C.R. 591. Dickson J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, said at
p. 599:

The effect of the rule in The Sussex
Peerage case, as it has been generally understood, is to render admissible
a statement by a deceased that he had received payment of a debt from another
or that he held a parcel of land as tenant and not as owner, but to render
inadmissible a confession by a deceased that he and not someone else was the
real perpetrator of the crime. The distinction is arbitrary and tenuous. There
is little or no reason why declarations against penal interest and those
against pecuniary or proprietary interest should not stand on the same footing.
A person is as likely to speak the truth in a matter affecting his liberty as
in a matter affecting his pocketbook. For these reasons and the ever-present
possibility that a rule of absolute prohibition could lead to grave injustice I
would hold that, in a proper case, a declaration against penal interest is
admissible according to the law of Canada; the rule as to absolute exclusion of
declarations against penal interest, established in The Sussex Peerage case,
should not be followed.

[Page 32]

In R. v. Demeter (1975), 10 O.R. (2d)
321, the Ontario Court of Appeal, while not deciding the issue of the
admissibility of declarations against penal interest, did enunciate the
principles which would have to apply to determine if a statement alleged to be
against penal interest could be admitted. On the appeal to this Court, [1978] 1
S.C.R. 538, it was stated at p. 545 that the principles enunciated by the
Court of Appeal would be a valuable guide if this Court decided that
declarations against penal interest were not, per se, inadmissible.
Those principles are as follows [at p. 544]:

1. The declaration would have to be made to
such a person and in such circumstances that the declarant should have
apprehended a vulnerability to penal consequences as a result. In Sussex
Peerage the Lord Chancellor would not have admitted the declaration in any
event of the rule because it was made to the declarant’s son. In ordinary
circumstances where a declaration is made for instance to an unestranged son,
wife or mother, the psychological assurance of reliability is lacking because
of [sic] risk of penal consequences is not real and the declarant may
have motives such as a desire for self‑aggrandizement or to shock which
makes the declaration unreliable.

2. The vulnerability to penal consequences
would have to be not remote.

3. “…the declaration sought to be given in
evidence must be considered in its totality. If upon the whole tenor the
weight is in favour of the declarant, it is not against his interest”: Re
Van Beelen, p. 208; R. v. Agawa (1975) 11 O.R. (2d) 176.

4. In a doubtful case a Court might
properly consider whether or not there are other circumstances connecting the
declarant with the crime and whether or not there is any connection between the
declarant and the accused.

5. The declarant would have to be
unavailable by reason of death, insanity, grave illness which prevents the
giving of testimony even from a bed, or absence in a jurisdiction to which none
of the processes of the Court extends. A declarant would not be unavailable in
the circumstances that existed in R. v. Agawa.

Having regard to the judgment of this Court in
the Demeter and O’Brien cases, it must now be recognized that in
a proper case, statements tendered on behalf of the accused and made by an
unavailable person may be admitted at trial if they

[Page 33]

can be shown to have been made against the penal
interest of the person making them; but neither the two cases to which I have
just referred nor any of the wealth of authorities cited in the courts below
apply such a rule to statements which have an inculpatory effect on the
accused. On the contrary, wherever such statements have been admitted it will
be found that they have an exculpatory effect. The difference is a very real
one because a statement implicating the accused in the crime with which he is
charged emanating from the lips of one who is no longer available to give
evidence robs the accused of the invaluable weapon of cross-examination which
has always been one of the mainstays of fairness in our courts.

In the present case the statements made by
Dumont which were tendered by the prosecutor are obviously inculpatory of the
appellant and in my opinion this is not a “proper case” for admitting them so
that the learned trial judge did err in permitting their introduction into
evidence and I would accordingly allow this appeal on the first ground
specified in the Notice of Appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial
in accordance with the alternative relief sought by the appellant.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM
THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law — Duty of an appellate tribunal
— Charge of assault causing bodily harm — Trial judge failing to consider
evidence of four witnesses — Whether the trial judge overlooked evidence
bearing on the relevant issue — New trial ordered.

An incident that occurred during appellant
police officer's arrest of a youth for drunkenness led to his being charged and
convicted of assault causing bodily harm. The trial judge did not take into
account the evidence of four witnesses who did not, in his opinion, observe the
events at the moment the appellant was alleged to have hit the youth. The
question is whether, by eliminating this evidence, the trial judge has so
misdirected himself as to the relevant evidence that the conviction cannot
stand.

Held (Ritchie J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Martland, Dickson, Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ.: An
appellate tribunal has neither the duty nor the right to reassess evidence at
trial for the purpose of determining guilt or innocence. Its duty, however,
includes a review of the record below to determine whether the trial court has
properly directed itself to all the evidence bearing on the relevant issues.
Where the record discloses a lack of appreciation of relevant evidence, the
reviewing tribunal must intercede. In the present case, a review of the record
showed that the trial judge failed entirely to consider all the evidence
bearing on the time period which he himself found to be vital. A new trial is
ordered.

Per Ritchie J., dissenting: Only
in the rarest cases will the Court accept the responsibility, as a second court
of appeal, of reversing findings of fact based upon the trial judge's
assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. Here, none of the four
witnesses purported to have

[page 3]

observed the actions
during the vital period. They could assert that they saw appellant deliver no
blows but were unable to say that no blows had been delivered at the time
complained of. Furthermore, appeals brought pursuant to s. 618(1) (6) of the Criminal Code  are limited to questions of law;
questions concerning a difference of opinion
as to the sufficiency of evidence are not included in that section.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of British Columbia dismissing the appellant's appeal from his conviction on a
charge of assault causing bodily harm. Appeal allowed, Ritchie J. dissenting.

D. Owen-Flood and Mel Hunt, for the
appellant.

W. G. Burke-Robertson,
Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Dickson, Beetz, Estey,
McIntyre and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

ESTEY
J.—I have had the opportunity of reading the judgment herein of my
colleague, Ritchie J., and for reasons which I shall now advance I must, with
all respect, come to the opposite conclusion; that is I would allow the appeal
and direct a new trial. Because in my view a new trial should be the result of
this appeal I will confine my observations to the two grounds which, in my
respectful view, direct this disposition. Firstly, the learned trial judge
failed entirely to take into account all the evidence which bore on the time
period which the trial court found to be vital in this proceeding, and
secondly, the proceedings at trial and on appeal have been completed without
any reference to s. 25  of the Criminal Code 
which deals with the protection afforded by law of a peace officer such as
the accused when acting ""on reasonable and probable grounds""
providing that in so doing such a person uses ""as much force as is
necessary"".

[page 4]

I turn to the first ground. The learned trial
judge, in his oral reasons, found that:

... the events immediately prior to that moment
in time [that is the arrival of the second officer] are the significant events.
What happened after that does not directly relate to the matter in issue.

The court then proceeded to examine the
evidence, stating:

Considering those events, that is to say from
the moment when Cst. Harper first spoke with
Mr. Higginson up to the point when he, Cst. Harper and Cst. Ellis saw
the missing tooth and the blood, I look at the evidence of the other witnesses
and I have had an opportunity to go carefully through all of my notes, which I
took in some detail, and I find that no other witness observed the events prior
to the second officer appearing on the scene.

There were, as we shall see, four witnesses
other than the informant, Higginson, and the Crown witness, Lindhout. The
evidence of these witnesses was expressly not taken into account in the
judgment process not because of rejection on the grounds of credibility but
apparently because the learned judge had concluded that none of those four
witnesses ""observed the events prior to the second officer appearing on
the scene"". The judgment at trial then concluded:

So that none of them are of any
assistance with regard to that exchange and
it is clear that the injuries of which Mr.
Higginson complains specially, that is, the injuries to his eye, his cheek and his tooth and mouth,
took place prior to the second officer appearing. [My emphasis.]

Earlier in the judgment the trial judge
specifically excluded the evidence of one witness, Mr. Dhaliwal, who clearly
testified only to the events occurring after the second officer had arrived
""which narrows us down to Miss Lindhout and Mr. Higginson"". The
question therefore is whether, by thus eliminating the evidence of the other
four witnesses in this fashion, the trial judge has so misdirected himself as
to the relevant evidence that the conviction cannot stand.

[page 5]

In order to resolve
this question it is necessary to set out some of the evidence of the witnesses
R. Harris, W. Harris, Jensen and Constable Ellis. First the evidence of R.
Harris, called on behalf of the accused, who at the time in question was a
passenger in his father's truck in the parking lot adjoining the service
station where the events in question took place. In one of the exhibits the
position of the witness with reference to the police car driven by the accused
is illustrated and no obstruction between the truck and the parked police car
is shown, nor is any mentioned in the evidence. The relevant excerpts from the
evidence of R. Harris are as follows:

Q. And when you looked around, what did you
see? 

A. Just the police car there and the two
people talking.

Q. There was a police car there and two
people talking. Was one of the people talking, was one in uniform?

A. Yes.

Q. What uniform was he in? 

A. Police uniform.

Q. And the man that the police officer was
talking—could you recognize the police officer if you saw him again in civilian clothes? Could you recognize
the policeman if you saw him again from his
face?

A. I don't know.

Q. Is the police officer, is he—is there a
man in Court with the same face as the police officer? Sitting in Court? Could
you look around? Do you know?

A. Well, I know that was one of the police
officers.

Q. Who?

A. That man over there.

Q. When you first saw the police car and the
police officer in uniform and the man at the service station; how many
policemen were there?

A. One.

Q. And you know the man over there was one of
the two police officers?

A. He was the first one.

Q. He was the first one? 

A. Yes.

Q. And what was that man over there doing
with the other man at the service station? When there was only one police officer, what
were they doing?

[page 6]

A. Sort of just struggling.

Q. The first time you saw them both, what were they doing?

A. It looked like they were just talking
like.

Q. Yes. Now, tell us in your own words what
you remember seeing, Randy. The first time you saw them, they were just
talking. Now, I want you to tell His Honour everything in your own words. Just
go on from there?

A. Well, we pulled around the back of the
service station, onto the Dog House parking lot and they were starting to just
struggle over something. I don't know. And a couple of minutes later another
police car pulled up, across the road and into the front of the Shell Station.
And then they struggled a little longer and then they both went down with the
civilian and when they got back up, they had the handcuffs on him.

[…]

Q. And did you see any punches, or blows with
fists, being thrown by any of the police officers? 

A. No.

Q. Did you see any of the police officers
kick this man?

A. No.

Q. When you saw there was—I think, Randy, you
used the term ""struggle"". Your Honour .. .

THE COURT:

Yes.

MR. OWEN-FLOOD:

Q. When you used the word
""struggle"", can you describe the struggle? What sort of struggle was
it?

A. Sort of like wrestling.

Q. Wrestling? 

A. Sort of like.

Q. Any punching by anybody? 

A. No.

Q. Were you interested—did you watch it the
whole time, or did you take your eyes off it and look at other things?

A. I was watching it most of the time.

Q. About how far away were you and your dad
from the struggle? You know how long a car is, Randy. I presume a car might be
as long as this table. I am terrible . . .

[page 7]

A. About 75 feet.

Q. About 75 feet. Did you have any difficulty
watching it? Was there anything to block or obstruct what you could see? In
other words, was there anything which would cause you not to be able to see
what was going on, some of the time?

A. The only part I missed was when they went
down, because of the police car there.

Q. I see. You missed—when you say when they
went down, you mean when they went down on the ground?

A. Yes.

Q. When I say the man, I don't mean either of
the two police officers. I mean the man they were struggling with. Can you tell
His Honour what that man seemed to be doing with the police officers?

A. Like, he was trying to get away.

Q. Now, how did the man and the two police
officers end up on the ground? How did that happen? What did you see about
that?

A. I'm not sure about that.

Q. I see. Were the police officers rough with
the man?

A. No, not really.

[…]

Q. You say the man and the police officer,
when you first saw them both, they were talking. Had you seen that man before
that?

A. Yes.

Q. Tell us about that, please?

A. Urn. Can I show you on this picture?

Q. Yes, please. The picture that Randy has is
Exhibit number .. .

A. I.

Q. ... number 1. Can you show us on the
picture?

A. I was waiting over here, about and I saw
the man walking behind the gas station over there.

Q. There is another gas station that looks
like .. . 

A. Esso.

Q. .. . Esso. Yes. You can see it in part of
the picture. Yes.

A. I saw him walk around there and he had a
little packsack on.

Q. Where did he walk to, Randy? From the Esso
Station to where?

A. Just behind it.

[page 8]

Q. And where did you next see him?

A. After my dad directed my attention to
there.

Q. And where was this struggle taking place?
Could you point it out?

A. Right by the end of the police car. 

[…]

CROSS-EXAMINATION

[…]

Q. All right. You said the man was trying to
get away. Was he trying to run away across the parking lot?

A. No. He was throwing himself around, trying
to get out of their hands.

Q. He didn't want to get in the car, from
what you could see; is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. And you were sitting in this
parking lot, which you say was about 75 feet away? 

A. Yes.

Q. You say there was nothing to obstruct your
vision; is that right? Except the police car, itself? 

A. Yes.

Q. But there is a fence, isn't there? 

A. Yes.

Q. Between the Dog House and the Shell
Service Station, of Scotch fir trees? 

A. Yes.

Q. Was your truck above those fir trees, so
you could see everything?

A. Yes.

Q. You say your dad directed your attention
to this? 

A. Yes.

Q. So obviously, I take it, you didn't
notice, right at the outset, what was happening? You didn't see the police car
arrive, for example?

A. No. 

[…]

Q. You were watching the whole time. I put it
to you, they were struggling when you first saw them, weren't they?

A. No.

Q. The policeman was holding the man, wasn't
he? 

A. I'm not sure.

[page 9]

Q. He may well have been holding that man and
talking to him, wasn't he? 

A. I don't know.

Q. The packsack was on the ground? 

A. Yes.

Q. You never saw the packsack on the boy's
back, did you?

A. Never .. .

Q. Except earlier .. .

MR. OWEN-FLOOD:

My friend interrupted.

MR. TAYLOR:

Q. Except when you saw him earlier on at the
Esso station?

A. Yes.

Q. You never saw the boy with the packsack on
his back, did you?

A. No. 

[…]

Q. When you were sitting in your father's
truck. Okay?

A. Yes.

Q. Were you looking right at the back of the
policemen, or were you looking at the back of the police car or were you
looking at the side of it?

A. Sort of like an angle. 

[…]

Q. Did you say that you saw no punches being
made by anyone?

A. Pardon me?

Q. You say that you saw no punches being
thrown or made by anyone?

A. Yes.

Q. Are you saying there were no punches, or
you saw no punches?

A. There was no punches.

Q. You are quite sure of that? 

A. Yes.

Q. By anyone, including the boy? 

A. I saw no punches.

The next witness is the father of R. Harris, that is W. Harris, who testified
as follows:

Q. What did you see?

[page 10]

A. I was going—approaching the highway and
there was a police car and officer and a civilian standing outside a pay booth
at the gas station. 

[…]

Q. What did you see?

A. At the time there was just one police car
there and I noticed an officer and one, as I say, civilian standing there.

Q. What were they doing?

A. At that time they were, just appeared to
be talking.

Q. Where was the
officer in regard to the civilian? 

A. Standing, facing like each other. 

[…]

Q. You saw something might be happening and
you picked up Randy and you drove to the Dog House parking lot. Did you at all
look back at the service station?

A. When I was going to get Randy?

Q. Yes.

A. Yes. I was watching it all the time.

Q. What did you see?

A. Until Randy—well, actually until we got
right back around to the Dog House, they were just standing there talking.

The witness Jensen,
called by the accused, was a security guard who at the time in question was
parked in his radio equipped automobile in a parking lot across the highway
from the Shell station. An exhibit filed at trial indicates the Jensen
automobile was directly across the street from the police car driven by the
accused and no obstruction between the two vehicles is indicated. Jensen was on
duty as a security guard at the time and his testimony was as follows:

Q. Yes. Continue in your own words?

A. I was checking this business along here
with my vehicle and I noticed a police vehicle in the Shell gas station at the
gas pumps. The officer seemed to be having a talk with one person, one male
person on the sidewalk of the gas station. I continued to watch. It appeared as
if the officer was

[page 11]

attempting to get this person into his car,
in the police vehicle.

Q. I am sorry, When you first saw the officer
and you said he appeared to be having a talk with another person, who I will
henceforth refer to as a civilian; what were the respective positions? Were
they touching each other?

A. To the best of my knowledge it was—it
appeared to be a normal conversation at that time. They were standing face to
face with each other.

Q. Yes.
And what happened then?

A. It appeared as if the officer was
attempting to get the person into his police car or .. .

Q. What did you see the officer do and what
did you see the civilian do?

A. The officer and the civilian appeared to
be grabbing each other by the arms. You know, struggling with each other,
grabbing and clutching.

Q. Yes. Continue. Just tell us what happened?

A. At this point I felt that the officer was
probably going to require assistance in retaining this person.

Q. What made you reach the conclusion that
the officer might require assistance?

A. It appeared that he was having difficulty
in containing this person.

Q. What did you see? What was the person
doing?

A. The person appeared to be trying to get
away from the officer. That is the impression I got.

Q. Yes?

A. So I radio-telephoned from my car the
Duncan detachment of the R.C.M.P. and advised them it appeared an officer of
their force was having a problem at the Shell Gas Station.

Q. Yes?

A. At the same time I was talking to the
dispatcher, another police vehicle from Duncan pulled into the gas station. 

[…]

Q. You were watching this for approximately
how long, in terns of minutes?

A. It would be about four or five minutes,
approximately. It is quite some time ago.

Q. Did you watch it intermittently or
continuously, or what?

A. Continuously.

[page 12]

Q. You were how many feet away from this
incident, approximately?

A. It would be about 100 feet, 120 feet.

Q. Were there any punches or blows thrown by
either of the police? Either one or both of the police officers or by the
civilian?

A. I did not notice any.

The
other policeman, Constable Ellis, testified as to what he
saw going on at the gas station at the time of his arrival:

Q. And when you saw Constable Harper's car,
how far away would you have been? 

A. Oh, probably a couple hundred feet.

Q. What if anything did you see apart from
the car?

A. At that time I saw Constable Harper
talking to an unidentified male on the opposite side of the car between the car
and the self-serve station.

Q. Did you continue to keep them under
observation while you were at that red light?

A. Not at that particular moment, as the
light turned green I observed it, Constable Harper was in somewhat of a scuffle
with that individual.

Q. Approximately how long would it have been
between when you first saw him and then when you then saw again that there was
some sort of a scuffle going on?

A. Ten to 30 seconds, approximately. 

[…]

Q. At that point you got there and stopped,
what did you see?

A. As I pulled in, I saw Constable Harper
engaged in a scuffle with this individual at the rear door of his police
vehicle.

Q. Can you describe this scuffle?

A. He had this gentleman pinned up between
him and the entrance to the door. The rear door of the police vehicle,
Constable Harper's door was open.

Q. How was this person pinned?

A. He had him between himself and the door,
holding him.

Q. Yes?

A. To stop him from moving.

Q. How was he holding him?

A. I believe in an arm lock, if I remember
correctly, but I'm not positive.

[page 13]

Later in his
testimony, under cross-examination, Constable Ellis stated:

Q. And the first time that you saw .. . you
saw anything, Constable Harper was in the Shell Service Station simply talking
to Higginson. There was no fighting or any scuffling going on.

A. When I first saw him, that is correct.

Q. And so you paid no particular attention,
you didn't think there was any particular disturbance; isn't that right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And then the next time you looked around
you could see that Constable Harper .. . that there was a scuffle going on with
Constable Harper trying to restrain Higginson.

A. That is correct.

Q. And you then thought that it looked as if
Harper needed assistance; isn't that correct? 

A. That's correct.

Q. And then you went to the police station
for the purpose of assisting Constable Harper; isn't that correct?

A. To the Shell Self-Serve.

Q. Sorry, the service station, yes. And when
you got there, Constable Harper had Higginson pinned up against the rear of the
car, the police car; isn't that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Higginson appeared to be struggling with
all his might; isn't that correct? 

A. That is correct.

Q. And you heard Constable Harper tell
Higginson that he was under arrest for being drunk in a public place. 

[…]

Q. ... did you at any time see Constable
Harper punch or hit Higginson? 

A. No, I did not.

There is no
question that at the time of these events the informant Higginson was under the
influence of alcohol. The Shell employee Lindhout, who was in the booth at the
gas station, testified that the informant Higginson arrived at the gas station
on foot and in the course of conversation with the witness asked if he could
have a car wash.

[page 14]

She testified that his words were a bit blurred.
She then testified ""I assumed he was a little drunk"" when she let him
into the Shell booth.

An appellate tribunal has neither the duty nor
the right to reassess evidence at trial for the purpose of determining guilt or
innocence. The duty of the appellate tribunal does, however, include a review
of the record below in order to determine whether the trial court has properly
directed itself to all the evidence bearing on the relevant issues. Where the
record, including the reasons for judgment, discloses a lack of appreciation of
relevant evidence and more particularly the complete disregard of such
evidence, then it falls upon the reviewing tribunal to intercede. This problem
was before this Court in MacDonald v. The
Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 665, when Laskin C.J. stated,
at p. 673:

It does not follow, however, that failure of
a trial judge to give reasons, not challengeable per se as an error of
law, will be equally unchallengeable if, having regard to the record, there is
a rational basis for concluding that the trial judge erred in appreciation of a
relevant issue or in appreciation of
evidence that would affect the propriety of his verdict. Where some
reasons are given and there is an omission
to deal with a relevant issue or to
indicate an awareness of evidence that could affect the verdict, it may
be easier for an appellate Court or for this
Court to conclude that reversible error was committed: see R. v. Bush, [1939] 1 W.W.R. 42, at p. 44; Ungaro v. R., [1950] S.C.R. 430; Horsburgh v. R., [1967] S.C.R. 746; Kolnberger v. R., [1969] S.C.R. 213.

The reference to Ungaro above no doubt includes the following (at pp. 437-38):

It is unnecessary to here resolve this
conflict as the authorities are unanimous
that where the misdirection is ""manifest"" or the assigned
reasons disclose self-misdirection the conviction cannot stand. 

[…]

In his reasons, with great respect, the
learned trial judge discloses that he had misdirected himself with

[page 15]

respect to the relevancy of the denial and
given to it an importance in relation to the main issue not justified upon the
authorities. Moreover, a reading of the reasons as a whole suggests that he did
not direct himself as to the explanation of the source of the goods in relation
to the evidence as required in Richier v. The
King, [1939] S.C.R. 101. There is at least
""reason to doubt that he properly charged himself when forming his
conclusions upon the evidence"" as stated by Chief Justice Moss in Rex v. Frank (1910) 16 C.C.C.
237, which, with respect would appear to be an
accurate statement of the limitation in respect to the presumption upon which Rex v. Bush, supra, was decided.

and again at p. 432
per Rinfret C.J.:

I do not mean that a trial judge is obliged
in his judgment to give all the reasons which lead him to the conclusion that
an accused is guilty. Undoubtedly if he finds one valid reason why he should reach
that conclusion it is not necessary that he should also give other reasons. It
is imperative, however, that he should give a decision upon all the points
raised by the defence which might be of a nature to bring about the acquittal
of the accused. In the present case, disearding, as he did, as
""fantastic"", the explanation of Ungaro's denial to the police was
insufficient to find the accused guilty. It was much more important that the
trial judge should have addressed himself to the main point in the accused's
defence, and which was the explanation of the circumstances which accompanied
the purchase from Seguin, the thief, of the goods stolen. As to that the
learned trial judge said absolutely nothing in his reasons, and, reading them,
a Court of Appeal is perfectly justified in holding that he completely
overlooked this point.

This issue was
apparently raised in the Court of Appeal but, in the reasons for judgment of
Craig J.A., it seems to have been disposed of on the basis that the trial judge
determined the point on the basis of credibility, rather than on whether the
effect of the trial judge's reasoning leading to
conviction was the wrongful exclusion from his consideration of the evidence of four witnesses bearing on the issue which the
trial judge himself had found to be the vital one. Lambert J.A. acknowledged:

If the trial judge completely overlooked part
of the evidence of four witnesses that related to events occurring before the
second police vehicle came to a stop at

[page 16]

the gas station,
then, in my opinion, there would in this case have been
a miscarriage of justice and the appeal ought to be allowed.

The learned justice then formed the opinion that
the trial judge did not wholly overlook this evidence. This opinion was
apparently reached on the basis of a later reference in the trial judgment to
the ""exchange"" between the accused and the informant Higginson and
that this term should be taken as meaning the narrow time period between the
confrontation of the police officer and the person being arrested and the time
that the punches were allegedly delivered. I must respectfully disagree with
the application of such fine reasoning to explanatory reasons given in a
criminal court for the conviction of an accused. Lambert J.A. expressed something
of this same thought when later the learned justice states:

I would add also that there is, to my mind,
considerable ambiguity as to what is meant by the words ""prior to the
second officer appearing on the scene"".

It was argued by the appellant before us that
such ambiguity, particularly in criminal proceedings, should be resolved in
favour of the accused. I do not think that this is a situation of ambiguity in
the sense of equivocal meanings of expressions found in penal statutes. What we
are here concerned with is whether or not the trial court, in assessing the
evidence in the course of finding guilt on the part of the accused, has fatally
overlooked relevant evidence submitted to the court on the very issue which
must be determined.

The trial judge in his report to the Court of
Appeal under s. 609(1)  of the Criminal
Code  stated:

In short, I considered the only issue before
me to be one of credibility .. .

Craig J.A., in the Court of Appeal, adverted to
this ground of appeal when he stated:

Mr. Owen-Flood [counsel for the accused]
submitted that four witnesses for the defence did, in fact, give testimony
about what they saw happening at the service station between Higginson and
Constable Harper before the arrival of Ellis and that, therefore, the judge erred
in not considering this testimony when considering particularly

[page 17]

whether he should find Miss Lindhout and Mr.
Higginson to be credible witnesses, as he in fact found.

Mr. Owen-Flood
submitted to this Court that his point had not been correctly taken by the
Court of Appeal. The submission with reference to the evidence of the four
witnesses was made not with reference to the issue of credibility, with which
the trial judge was so much concerned, but on the issue that by the wrongful
exclusion of this evidence from the judgment process the trial court had
misdirected itself, a misdirection which if given to a jury would have been
fatal to a fair trial.

The learned justice
on appeal then concluded:

On this basis, the trial judge could very
well in reviewing the evidence and his notes conclude, as he did conclude, that
their testimony on this particular point was not helpful.

But the trial judge
did not conclude the evidence in question was ""not helpful"". Rather
he found:

(a) "". . . no other witness observed the events prior to the second officer
appearing on the scene"";

(b) ""... none of them are of any
assistance with regard to that exchange . . . ""; and

(c) "". . . which narrows us down to Miss
Lindhout and Mr. Higginson"".

Lambert J.A., as I
have said, addressed this ground of appeal directly. He concluded, by
attributing a narrow meaning to the reference by the trial judge to ""an
exchange"" between the informant and the accused, that the trial judge had
in fact considered the evidence of all the witnesses before reducing his
consideration of the relevant evidence (in his view) to that of Higginson and
Lindhout. The words used by the trial judge in giving his reasons for the conviction of the
accused do not, however,
lend themselves, in my respectful view, to such a fine and narrow
interpretation. Whether such a process of interpretation should be applied in
determining the propriety of a self-direction in a criminal trial is another
aspect which need not be determined here. In my view it is sufficient for the
purposes of this appeal to apply

[page 18]

the principle that
the reviewing tribunal must be satisfied as I am, with all respect to others
who do not agree, that the judge at trial wrongly failed to consider evidence
which did bear directly on the issue of guilt or innocence. Such being the
case, in my view the proper procedure in this proceeding is an order directing
a new trial.

A second element of
law arose in the course of the hearing of this appeal before this Court when my
colleague Lamer J. enquired of both counsel as to whether s. 25(1)  of the Criminal Code  had been raised in the courts below. It had not.

Section 25(1) 
provides as follows:

25. (1) Every one who is required or authorized by law to do anything in the administration or enforcement of the
law

(a) as a private person,

(b) as a peace officer or public officer,

(c) in aid of a peace
officer or public officer, or

(d) by virtue of his office,

is, if he acts on reasonable and probable grounds, justified in doing what he is required or authorized to
do and in using as much force as is necessary for that purpose.

The accused here was
admittedly a peace officer. He was at the time in question in the act of
arresting the informant for drunkenness. The evidence of the Crown witness
Lindhout was that the informant was intoxicated. The trial judge found the
informant ""had been drinking in the evening in question"". That a
peace officer is justified in arresting a person for being intoxicated in a
public place contrary to a provincial statute, if the peace officer reasonably
believes such person is intoxicated, has long been settled. In the course of so
acting the peace officer has been provided with a defence in law not available
to persons who do not come within s. 25 . The trial court was not directed to
the defence of the use of 'as much force as is necessary for that purpose' and
hence no consideration of the evidence on this point was undertaken at trial.
The

[page 19]

same applies to the
deliberations of the Court of Appeal. There are other matters to be taken into
account once s. 25  is invoked but believing as I do that a new trial is the
proper disposition here, nothing further should be said which might have the
effect of prejudging this or any other issue raised on this appeal.

I would therefore
allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and order a new
trial.

The following are
the reasons delivered by

RITCHIE
J. (dissenting)—T
his is an appeal
brought pursuant to leave granted by this Court in conformity with the
provisions of s. 618(1) (b) of the Criminal Code  which reads as follows:

618. (1) A person who is convicted of an
indictable offence and whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

[…]

(b) on any question of law, if leave to
appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty-one days after the judgment appealed from is
pronounced or within such extended
time as the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for special
reasons, allow.

The appeal is from
the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia which
dismissed an appeal from the judgment of judge Millward convicting the
appellant, a police officer, on a charge of assault causing bodily harm. The
evidence discloses that after dark on an evening in February 1978, a young man
by the name of Higginson who at the time had consumed something in excess of
the amount of alcohol appropriate to his capacity, had decided to hitchhike
from the City of Duncan on Vancouver Island to Victoria. For this purpose he
was equipped with a packsack and before embarking on his hike he stopped at a
food store where he purchased some chicken to sustain himself. Having acquired
the chicken he took it to a self-serve gas station which was usually staffed by
a girlfriend of his. On the night in question, however, another girl named
Lindhout was on duty; she was a stranger to

[page 20]

Higginson but
nevertheless invited him into the booth where she worked so that he might have
shelter while eating his chicken. Shortly after he had entered the booth a
police car, operated by the appellant, Harper, drove into the service station
and signalled for Higginson to come over to him and when the young man came out
of the booth he was asked to take off the packsack he was wearing and there
seems to be no doubt that he did this without too much trouble after Harper had
got out of his car. It is also common ground that within a very few minutes
another police car, operated by Constable Ellis, appeared on the scene and that
he dismounted from his car and proceeded to assist Harper in subduing Higginson
so as to get him into the police car for transfer to the police station, as he
had by this time been placed under arrest by Harper for drunkenness.

It is during the
very brief period from the time that Higginson removed his packsack until the
time when Constable Ellis arrived that the offence here charged was allegedly
committed. As to this period there is direct conflict with Higginson saying
that after he had removed his packsack and asked why he should get into the
police car, Harper "". .. never said anything or nothing, he just punched
me in the mouth and it knocked out my front tooth"". Miss Lindhout swore
that she saw these blows being delivered from a distance of 4 or 5 feet. On the
other hand, Harper stoutly denied having delivered any blow. The learned trial
judge believed the Crown witnesses and found Harper's story unworthy of belief.

As the facts were
carefully reviewed by the trial judge and as his findings were expressly
affirmed by the Court of Appeal, I think it most convenient to reproduce his
account of what occurred. Starting with a review of Miss Lindhout's evidence,
the learned judge went on to say:

Miss Lindhout testified that she was working
at the Gulf Self-Serve that evening as
cashier. She described the view of the area
that she had from her booth and said that around 9:00 or 9;30 that
evening she saw Mr. Higginson. She had
not seen him before. She saw him crossing Trunk Road with his packsack and a little
black suitcase and with chicken and
some salad.

[page 21]

She spoke with him briefly. She said 'I
assumed he was a little drunk when he asked for a car wash because he didn't
have a car'. She said his walk was all right. They had a discussion and after
about five minutes, the police car drove in.

She says the police car drove to a position
in front of the cash booth. Cst. Harper motioned with his finger to Higginson
to come out, Higginson said, 'I guess I'd better go'. He went out and he spoke
with Cst. Harper. The two spoke briefly, the accused, Cst. Harper, was in the
car, Mr. Higginson was facing him.

Cst. Harper got out of the car, the boy
turned and motioned towards his pack. Cst. Harper helped him remove the pack,
the black case was on the ground. Higginson turned around and the accused
started to hit him in the face. She saw no prior violence.

Mr. Higginson stepped back a bit, the young
lady said, 'After I seen him get hit a couple of times in the face, I got up
and went out. I said, 'What are you doing. He may have had a couple of drinks
but that's no reason to hit him like that'. Cst. Harper responded, 'Get inside
where you're supposed to be'.

She said, 'What is your badge number?' Cst.
Harper said, 'If you don't get inside, I'll arrest you for obstructing an
officer in the line of duty'. She went inside and the other police car drove
up.

She insisted that Mr. Higginson did not offer
any violence to anyone. When the other officer approached, the young lady went
outside again to talk to the boy and she saw that Higginson's face was bleeding
and his tooth was missing.

In cross-examination she said after the
backpack had been removed, the boy turned to face the accused and she saw the
policeman hit the boy in the face with his clenched fist. She was quite definite
about this. She said, 'I seen him hit him in the face'.

She was asked, 'Have you any doubt about
it'?' and replied, 'None'.

When referred to her testimony in the
preliminary inquiry, she said that since then she had had time to think things
over and she is very sure the boy was hit in the face. She was about four or
five feet away from the participants when she witnessed these events.

Now, Cst. Harper says, in effect, that for
reasons that he explained, he felt it incumbent upon him to investigate

[page 22]

the circumstances of Mr. Higginson and he
looked for him and he found him in the Shell booth. He gestured to Higginson to
come out; Higginson picked up his horn case, he had a bag of chicken in his
hand, he set the case down and leaned over to speak with Cst. Harper.

There was a discussion, the constable decided
that Mr. Higginson was drunk and that he should not be on the highway for his
own safety and he told Mr. Higginson that he was arrested, being arrested for
being drunk in a public place and he described the further conversation and his
attempts to put Mr. Higginson in the car, and the difficulties he had in doing
so.

Cst. Ellis drove up, the young lady came out
and said, 'Why are you hitting him?' He said, 'Go back or I'll charge you . . .
' and so on. Cst. Ellis asked what was going on, Cst. Harper said, 'I'm trying
to get this fellow into the car', whereupon Higginson turned his face around
and it was apparent that he, Higginson, at that point in time had a tooth
missing and had blood on his lip.

Now, in my
view, the events immediately prior to that moment in time are the significant
events. What happened after that does not directly relate to the matter in
issue. I heard a good deal of evidence as to the
conduct of Mr. Higginson after that time and it is very likely that he was the
author of some of his own injuries from then on.

Considering those events, that is to say from
the moment when Cst. Harper first spoke with Mr. Higginson up to the point when
he, Cst. Harper and Cst. Ellis saw the missing tooth and the blood, I look at
the evidence of the other witnesses and I have had an opportunity to go
carefully through all of my notes, which I took in some detail, and I find that
no other witness observed the events prior to the second officer appearing on
the scene. So that none of them are of any assistance with regard to that
exchange and it is clear that the injuries of which Mr. Higginson complains
specifically, that is, the injuries to his eye, his cheek and his tooth and
mouth, took place prior to the second officer appearing.

So what we have is a situation where
Higginson suffered those injuries in a' span of a minute or two or three while
he was confronting Cst. Harper. Cst. Harper says he does not know how the
injuries took place, he can only offer the hypothesis that they were accidental
and that Higginson's face came into contact with some' part of the police car
because of the struggle.

[page 23]

On the other side of the picture, the Crown
witness Dhaliwal positively states that he saw two officers striking the
victim. I do not think Mr. Dhaliwal's evidence is particularly helpful in view
of the finding that I have made that the significant injuries took place prior
to the second officer coming on the scene, which narrows us down to Miss
Lindhout and Mr. Higginson.

I observed Miss Lindhout with great care and
in my opinion, she gave her evidence with a sincere desire to describe the
events precisely as they took place. Undoubtedly, she cannot remember every
detail and undoubtedly some of the sequence of events may disagree with other
witnesses but I am satisfied beyond any shadow of a doubt that she told the
story as she saw it.

1 am satisfied that she described Cst. Harper
striking Mr. Higginson, honestly, and I accept her evidence. I find that Cst.
Harper's denial is not credible, that notwithstanding the evidence of good
character, all of which 1 accept, 1 am unable to accept his statement that he
did not strike Mr. Higginson and find it a fact that he did assault Mr.
Higginson as charged by striking him with his fist in the face more than once;
that he had no justification for doing so and that by so striking him, he
caused bodily harm. And as a result, I find Cst. Harper guilty as charged.

(The italics are my own.)

Appeals
such as the present one brought pursuant to s. 618(1) (b) are limited to
questions of law and it has repeatedly been held in this Court that where a
""question of law"" is referred to, it carries the meaning of law in
the strict sense so that questions concerning a difference of opinion as to the sufficiency of the evidence are
not included. In this regard reference may be had to the reasons for judgment
of Chief Justice Anglin in Gauthier v. The King, [1931] S.C.R. 416, where he said of such
an appeal as the present one [at p. 417]:

Assuming that the question, whether there was
any evidence to support a conviction, should be deemed a question of law, the
question whether the proper inference has been drawn by the trial judge from
facts established in evidence, is really not a question of law,

[page 24]

but purely a question of fact for his
consideration.

The facts as found by the learned trial judge in
the present case were expressly adopted by the Court of Appeal and the
questions of law advanced on behalf of the appellant as justification in the
present appeal are the following:

1. Whether the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia erred in law in concluding that the
Learned Trial Judge had properly
directed himself on all relevant, admissible evidence, when the Reasons
for Judgment of the Learned Trial Judge disclose a failure to consider
relevant, admissible evidence.

2. Whether the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia erred, when having found ambiguity
in the Reasons for Judgment of the
Learned Trial Judge, in not giving the benefit of that ambiguity to the
Appellant.

3. Whether the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia erred in law in concluding that as long as there was some evidence
upon which the Learned Trial Judge could
have convicted, it should not and could not interfere with the verdict, even
where the Reasons for Judgment of the Learned Trial judge in convicting
expressly disclosed a failure to
consider relevant, admissible evidence at trial.

Three judges (Craig, Lambert and MacDonald
JJ.A.) sat on the appeal but only Craig and Lambert delivered reasons for
judgment whereas MacDonald J.A. limited himself to a concurrence. All the
judgments were oral, and in the result were unanimous in dismissing the appeal.

It appears to me to be desirable to deal with
the second issue raised by the appellant and in this regard it should be
pointed out that there was no finding of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia as to ambiguity in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial
judge. The only mention of ambiguity is to be found in the reasons for judgment
of Mr. Justice Lambert where he says:

I would add also that there is, to my mind,
considerable ambiguity as to what is meant by the words ""prior to the
second officer appearing on the scene"".

When reference is had to the above quoted
excerpt from the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge it will be
apparent that he considered the

[page 25]

events of the evening to be divided between the
period prior to the appearance of the second officer and the events which occurred
after his arrival. The trial judge said of the witnesses who did not observe
the prior events:

So that none of them are of any assistance with regard to that exchange and it is clear that the
injuries of which Mr. Higginson complains specifically,
that is, the injuries to his eye, his cheek
and his tooth and mouth, took place prior to the second officer
appearing.

In any event, Mr. Justice Lambert's use of the
word ""ambiguity"" in his reasons for judgment is qualified by the second
to last paragraph where he says:

... it is my opinion that any ambiguity about the disputed sentence in the
reasons for judgment of the trial judge can
be resolved by reference to the remainder of his judgment and the evidence that was before him.

When the reasons for judgment of the Court of
Appeal are read as a whole, it will be seen that there is no finding of
ambiguity in the reasons for judgment of the trial judge. As to the first and
third issues raised as questions of law by the appellant, it will be observed
that they are both predicated on the suggestion that the learned trial judge
failed to consider the relevant admissible evidence. This appears to be based
on the assumption that four of the witnesses for the appellant gave evidence
which was relevant to the issue and which was completely ignored by the trial
judge. The fact of the matter is, however, that none of these witnesses
purported to have observed the actions of Harper and Higginson during the vital
period before the arrival of Constable Ellis, which is the time when the
assault is alleged to have taken place. It is furthermore of significance that
although the appellant describes the witnesses called on his behalf as having
testified in direct contradiction to the evidence of Lindhout and Higginson,
they were actually unable to go any further than to assert that they had seen
no blows delivered by Harper and none of them was able to say that no blows had
been delivered at the time of which Higginson complains.

It is apparent from a review of the reasons for
judgment at trial and those of the Court of Appeal

[page 26]

that any differences between the judgment and
the allegations of the appellant before this Court are based upon the trial
judge's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. What we have here is a
case of concurrent findings of fact based upon the trial judge's assessment of
the witnesses and it has long been recognized in this Court that it is only in
the rarest of cases that we will accept the responsibility as a second court of
appeal of reversing such findings.

In the case of R. v. Warner, [1961] S.C.R. 144,
the appellate division of the Supreme Court of Alberta allowed the
appeal in part on the first ground that in its opinion

.. the verdict
of guilty of murder should be set aside on the ground
that it could not be supported by the evidence, .. .

As to this finding, Mr. Justice Cartwright,
speaking for the majority of the Court, stated that:

So far as the judgment of the Appellate
Division is based on the first ground mentioned, this Court is powerless to interfere with it. The question
whether the Appellate Division was right in proceeding on this ground is not a question of law in the strict
sense. It is a question of fact or,
at the best from the point of view of the appellant, a mixed question of
fact and law.

The position of an appellate court in such
circumstances as those here disclosed is most dramatically described by Lord
Shaw in Clarke v. Edinburgh and District
Tramways Co., Ltd., [1919] S.C. (H.L) 35, at p. 37:

In my opinion, the duty of an appellate Court
in those circumstances is for each Judge of it to put to himself, as I now do
in this case, the question, Am I—who sit here without those advantages,
sometimes broad and sometimes subtle, which are the privilege of the Judge who
heard and tried the case—in a position, not having those privileges, to come to
a clear conclusion that the Judge who had them was plainly wrong? If I cannot
be satisfied in my own mind that the Judge with those privileges was plainly wrong, then it appears to me to be my duty
to defer to his judgment.

Having regard to all the above and with the
greatest respect for those who may entertain a different view, I would dismiss
this appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Attempts—Fraud—Concurrence
between actus reus and mens
rea—Proof of intent—Whether accused went beyond mere preparation—Criminal Code,
R.S.C 1970, c. C‑34, s. 24.

The Ontario Court of Appeal set aside
appellant’s conviction of fraud and substituted a conviction of attempted fraud
since the subject of the alleged fraud was not in fact deceived. The
complainant was assisting the Ontario Ministry of Consumer and Commercial
Relations in monitoring the practices of car repairs business and knew that the
transmission of the car brought to the appellant’s garage had been tampered
with. The Court found that the evidence adduced was only consistent with the
appellant renewing his original representation after he became aware that that
was untrue.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

There is no discernible distinction between
intent as it goes to the substantive offence and as it goes to a mere attempt.
In either case the actus reus is essential to the particular charge.
Section 24  of the Criminal Code  merely required proof of intent and of
accused going beyond mere preparation. Here, the external facts found in the
evidence carried the acts beyond mere intention and amounted to a continuance
of the accused’s objective manifestation. This established the elements of the
attempt.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court
of Appeal setting aside appellant’s conviction of fraud and substituting a
conviction of attempted fraud. Appeal dismissed.

[Page 584]

Alan D. Gold, for the appellant.

David H. Doherty, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This case arose out of a
charge of fraud laid against the appellant under Criminal Code , s.
338(1) (b). His conviction at trial was set aside by the Ontario Court of
Appeal which substituted a conviction of attempted fraud, it being conceded
that the subject of the alleged fraud, one Sheila Harris, an employee of the
Ontario Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations, was not in fact
deceived. She had been assisting the Ministry in monitoring the practices of
persons operating garage repair businesses. She had brought a well used car to
the appellant’s repair shop, knowing that the transmission had been slightly
tampered with and could be rectified with a few minutes work. She told the
appellant that she had transmission trouble, and after he took the car for a
test drive he told her that the transmission would have to be rebuilt and that
the repair would cost $189 plus $3.50 sales tax.

When Sheila Harris reclaimed the car she paid
the previously mentioned charge for the work. Without going into detail, it is
enough to say that the bill she received noted that the transmission had been
rebuilt but this was not in fact so. The Ontario Court of Appeal, speaking
through MacKinnon A.C.J.O. held that there was an attempt to commit the offence
specified in the indictment. In his view, “the evidence is consistent only with
the appellant renewing or continuing his original representation that the
transmission required overhauling after he became aware that that was untrue”.

In this Court, counsel for the appellant
advanced three propositions, of which the third was that there must be a
concurrence between the actus reus (the representation) and the mens rea that there was no mens
rea at the time the statement or representation to the Crown witness was

[Page 585]

made, and that if mens rea, did arise
later, the actus reus had been long completed. I need say as
to this submission only that it is covered by the finding above-quoted by
MacKinnon A.C.J.O. Concurrence was therefore present.

The other two propositions advanced by Mr. Gold for
the appellant were not as such reflected in the Court of Appeal’s reasons.
Counsel dwelt on two points. First, he said that Criminal Code , s. 24(1) 
dealing with attempts contains an inherent contradiction when it requires proof
of an intent to commit the substantive offence. Moreover, it involves, on his
submission, proof of all the ingredients essential to the full offence, and if
no crime has been committed (when the complainant has not been deceived) the
accused cannot be charged with the required intent. Moreover, in the counsel’s
view, an attempt envisages failure not success, and if the planned deception
has been achieved there can be no liability for attempt.

Second, it was his submission that proximity was
an essential requirement in the sense, to put it generally, that the actions of
the accused must go beyond mere preparation and close (a question of degree) to
the realization of his purpose. Putting these matters another way, if the acts
of the accused go beyond mere preparation, they could amount to an attempt;
however, if they are thereafter carried out and result in success and if, as in
this case they do not amount to a crime, there could be a conviction of
attempt. Counsel for the accused contends that the provisions of Criminal
Code , s. 24(1)  which define attempts do not affect the cogency of his
propositions.

Criminal Code , s.
24(1)  and (2)  read as follows:

24. (1)
Every one who, having an intent to commit an offence, does or omits to do
anything for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an attempt
to commit the offence whether or not it was possible under the circumstances to
commit the offence.

(2) The question whether an act or omission
by a person who has an intent to commit an offence is or is not mere
preparation to commit the offence, and too

[Page 586]

remote to constitute an attempt to commit
the offence, is a question of law.

There are answers to these propositions under
this statutory provision. In the first place, there is no discernible
distinction between intent as it goes to the substantive offence and as it goes
to a mere attempt. In either case, the actus reus is essential to the particular charge.
In this case the question whether the accused’s intent remained only subjective
is answered by what was said by the Ontario Court of Appeal. The external facts
found in the evidence carried the acts beyond mere intention and amounted to a
reaffirmation or a continuance of the accused’s objective manifestation. This
established the elements of the attempt.

This leaves for consideration the so-called
proximity principle. It may well be that this is envisaged by the reference to
remoteness in s. 24(2) , but I do not see that it advances the essential issue
in attempt which requires going beyond mere preparation. Nor do I find cogency
in the appellant’s submission that if there is impossibility this does not
bring any act of the accused closer to realization so as to establish
proximity. I read s. 24(1)  as making a different distinction, one merely
requiring proof of intent and of accused going beyond mere preparation by
making, as in this case, a false representation even though not resulting in
full realization of his objective.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

THE COURT—We are all of the opinion, for the
reasons stated by the Court of Appeal of Ontario, that that Court did not err
in law in deciding that a person can plead guilty to and be convicted of the
lesser and included offence of second degree murder on an indictment of first
degree murder, without the intervention of the jury.

We did not find it necessary to call upon the
respondent with respect to the second ground of appeal, namely, that the trial
judge had failed to apply proper principles in arriving at the 15‑year
ineligibility period. In our opinion this question is not an appropriate one
for determination in this Court.

This appeal is accordingly dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR NOVA
SCOTIA

Trial—Defences—Mistake—Charge of driving
without a licence—Licence revoked for criminal driving offence but reinstated
pending appeal—Respondent knew appeal dismissed but not officially notified of
revocation following appeal—Absence of mens rea—Whether or not charge one of
strict liability so importing defence of mistake of fact—Whether or not effect
to be given to defence of “officially induced error”—Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.N.S.
1967, c. 191, ss. 250,258(2).

Respondent’s driving privileges, cancelled
following his conviction for a driving related criminal offence, were
reinstated during the appeal process and finally revoked on the appeal’s
dismissal. Although aware of the disposition of the appeal, respondent had not
yet received the Order of Revocation of License when he was stopped by police
and asked to present his licence. A summary offence ticket was later issued to
respondent charging him with driving while his licence was cancelled. This
appeal related to that charge. The trial judge’s decision to dismiss it was
upheld on appeal by both the County Court and the Court of Appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

The offence created by s. 258(2) of the Motor
Vehicle Act was one of strict liability and a defence was available to the
accused if he “reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true,
would render” his act of continuing to drive without a licence, an innocent
one. Respondent’s mistake, however, because of s. 250(3) of the Act, was
one of law in relation to his right to drive after his appeal had been
dismissed. The effect

[Page 606]

of s. 19  of the Criminal Code , which
provides that ignorance of the law by a person who commits an offence is not an
excuse for committing that offence, is that a mistake of law does not afford
respondent a defence. As the accused was not misled by an error on the part of
the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, it was unnecessary to consider a defence of
justification arising in the situation of a mistake of law occasioned by
“officially induced error”.

R. v. Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, considered; R. v. Prue, R. v. Baril, [1979]
2 S.C.R. 547, referred to.

appellant.

the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought by leave of
this Court from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Nova
Scotia (Jones J. dissenting) dismissing an appeal from a judgment of His Honour
Judge Alan E. Sullivan affirming the judgment rendered at trial by Judge S.D.
Campbell by which that judge dismissed the charge laid against the respondent
for driving his motor vehicle while his licence was cancelled, contrary to
s. 258(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.N.S. 1967, c. 191, which
reads as follows:.

258. …

(2) A person shall not drive a motor
vehicle while his license or privilege of obtaining a license is cancelled or
suspended under this Act.

[Page 607]

Leave to appeal to this Court was sought on the
following questions of law, namely:

1. That the majority of the Appeal Division of
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia erred in law in giving effect to the defence
of officially induced error;

2. That the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia erred in law in holding that an offence under ss. (2) of
s. 258 of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.N.S. 1967, c. 191 as amended is an
offence of strict liability rather than an offence of absolute liability.

It will be more convenient in my view to first
consider the second of these grounds as it is essential before proceeding with
any consideration of the issues raised by this appeal to be satisfied as to the
nature of the offence with which the respondent is charged.

Three classes of statutory offences have been
recognized in the reasons for judgment of my brother Dickson in R. v. Sault
Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, at pp. 1325-26 where he said:

I conclude, for the reasons which I have
sought to express, that there are compelling grounds for the recognition of
three categories of offences rather than the traditional two:

1. Offences in which mens rea, consisting
of some positive state of mind such as intent, knowledge, or recklessness, must
be proved by the prosecution either as an inference from the nature of the act
committed, or by additional evidence.

2. Offences in which there is no necessity
for the prosecution to prove the existence of mens rea; the doing
of the prohibited act prima facie imports the offence, leaving it open
to the accused to avoid liability by proving that he took all reasonable care.
This involves consideration of what a reasonable man would have done in the
circumstances. The defence will be available if the accused reasonably
believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render the act or
omission innocent, or if he took all reasonable steps to avoid the
particular event. These offences may properly be called offences of strict
liability. Mr. Justice Estey so referred to them in Hickey’s case.

[Page 608]

3. Offences of absolute liability where it
is not open to the accused to exculpate himself by showing that he was free of
fault.

[The underlining is mine]

In the same case, Mr. Justice Dickson went on
to say:

Offences which are criminal in the true
sense fall in the first category. Public welfare offences would prima facie be
in the second category. They are not subject to the presumption of full mens
rea. An offence of this type would fall in the first category only if such
words as “wilfully,” “with intent,” “knowingly,” or “intentionally” are
contained in the statutory provision creating the offence. On the other hand,
the principle that punishment should in general not be inflicted on those without
fault applies. Offences of absolute liability would be those in respect of
which the Legislature had made it clear that guilt would follow proof merely of
the proscribed act. The overall regulatory pattern adopted by the Legislature,
the subject matter of the legislation, the importance of the penalty, and the
precision of the language used will be primary considerations in determining
whether the offence falls into the third category.

I am in agreement with all of the judges in the
courts below, including the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal, in finding
that as the offence here charged is one concerning the public welfare it was
properly characterized as “an offence of strict liability” within the meaning
of the classification stipulated by Mr. Justice Dickson (supra) and
that a defence is accordingly available to the accused if he “reasonably
believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render” his act in
continuing to drive his motor vehicle without a licence, an innocent one.

The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are
not seriously in dispute and can be summarized in their essentials as follows:

On March 6, 1979 the respondent was convicted of
“fail duty at scene of accident contrary to section 233 -2  of the Criminal
Code ,” as a result of which an order of revocation of his licence to drive

[Page 609]

was sent to him on April 10, 1979 by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles of the Province of Nova Scotia in conformity with
the provisions of s. 250(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act. In due course
the respondent appealed his conviction and on May 1, 1979 a notice of
re-instatement of his driving privileges as of that date was sent to him. On
December 21, 1979 a written decision was filed with the Clerk of the County
Court dismissing the appeal and, of particular importance in this case, some
time in January 1980, the respondent’s solicitor advised him of the fact that
his appeal had been dismissed.

It was not until January 25, 1980, at about 9
a.m., that the respondent was stopped by the R.C.M.P. while driving to work in
his motor vehicle at which time his licence was called for by the police. On
the evening of the same day the respondent received in his mail a notice
entitled “Order of Revocation of License” signed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
purporting to be issued “pursuant to the authority vested in… [him] by Section
250 of the Motor Vehicle Act.”

It was not until March 11, 1980 that a summary
offence ticket was issued to the respondent charging him with the offence with
which we are now concerned. As the actions of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
purported to be in the exercise of his authority under s. 250 of the Motor
Vehicle Act, I find it desirable to reproduce the relevant portions of that
section in full. That section reads as follows and I have underlined
those portions which I consider to be particularly relevant:

250 (1)
Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the Registrar or the Director of
Highway Safety shall revoke effective the date of conviction the driver’s
license of any person upon receiving a record of his conviction for any of the
following crimes or offences:

(a) manslaughter resulting from the
operation of a motor vehicle, in violation of Section 219  of the Criminal Code ;

(b) an offence against Section 203 , 204 ,
233 , 234 , 235 , 236 , 238  or 295  of the Criminal Code ;

(c) theft of a motor vehicle in violation
of Section 294  of the Criminal Code ;

(d) any offence against the Criminal Code 
designated by the Governor in Council;

[Page 610]

(e) making a false affidavit, declaration
or statement to the Department or the Registrar in violation of this Act; or

(f) a violation of Section 258 of this Act.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) but
subject to subsections (3) and (4), when a person is convicted of any
of the crimes or offences mentioned in subsection (1), the driver’s
license or the privilege of obtaining a driver’s license is thereupon and
hereby revoked and shall remain revoked.

(3) When a person appeals against a
conviction for an offence mentioned in subsection (1) in the manner
prescribed by law, the person shall be deemed not to be convicted for the
purpose of subsections (1) and (2) and the provisions of this Act until
the appeal is heard, determined and dismissed or is abandoned or the right to
proceed with the appeal extinguished and the driver’s license or the privilege
of obtaining a driver’s license shall be thereupon and hereby revoked and shall
remain revoked.

(4) A person whose driver’s license is revoked
under this Section may drive a motor vehicle until noon the third day after the
date of his conviction as will permit him to return to his place of residence
or to sell or dispose of a motor vehicle registered in his name.

(5) When a court or magistrate convicts a
person of any of the crimes or offences mentioned in subsection (1), the
court or magistrate shall communicate to the person the effect of this Section,
but the failure to do so shall not affect in any way the validity of the
revocation.

(6) When a court or magistrate convicts a
person of any of the crimes or offences mentioned in subsection (1) the
person whose license is revoked shall produce the license forthwith to the
court or magistrate who shall make thereon an endorsement in the following
words or words to the like effect;

“not
valid as of noon the

day
of , 19”

and he shall sign the endorsement, but the
failure to do so shall not affect the validity of the revocation.

(7) When a person appeals against a
conviction for an offence mentioned in subsection (1) in the manner
prescribed by law, the court or magistrate whose conviction is appealed from
may endorse the driver’s license using the following words or words to like
effect:

[Page 611]

“Revocation stayed pending appeal,”

and he shall date and sign the endorsement.

(8) Where an appeal is heard, determined
and dismissed or is abandoned or the right to proceed with the appeal is
extinguished, the court to which the appeal was made or the Registrar may order
the person to appear and surrender his driver’s license and the order may be
enforced by a peace officer.

The respondent does not question the validity of
his conviction on March 6, 1979 for a breach of s. 233(2)  of the Criminal
Code  nor the notice of the order of revocation of his licence which was
sent to him on April 10 of that year by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. It is
apparent that pursuant to s. 250(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act, proof
of such conviction carries with it a mandatory requirement that the Registrar
shall revoke the licence of a convicted driver, but what is at issue here is
the status of such a driver after he has asserted an appeal from his conviction
and this involves a close consideration of s. 250(3) which provides that
when a person who has been convicted under s. 233  of the Criminal Code  appeals
against that conviction he “shall be deemed not to be convicted for the purpose
of subsection… (1)… [of s. 250] until the appeal has been heard and
dismissed” and “the driver’s license or the privilege of obtaining a driver’s
license shall be thereupon and hereby revoked and shall remain revoked.”

In acquitting the respondent the trial judge
made the following findings with respect to the effect of the notice entitled
“Order of Revocation of License” which was not received by MacDougall until the
afternoon of January 25 whereas the present charge alleges a breach of
s. 258 of the Motor Vehicle Act at 9 a.m. on the morning of that
day.

In this respect the learned trial judge found:

I believe Mr. MacDougall when he says
that the actual certified mail arrived that afternoon and the remaining
question, one of law and one of fact to be disposed of, is whether or not that
he believed that he was entitled to

[Page 612]

drive and whether or not that gives him a
defence. First of all, I believe Mr. MacDougall when he tells me he was
under the honest impression that he was entitled to drive pending some
notification from the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Registrar specifically,
telling him that he was once again suspended from driving as a result of the
disposition of his appeal. I base that on his appearance and testimony that he
gave on the stand, his behaviour when he was accosted, he was open and obvious
in his driving…

The trial judge also found of MacDougall that

His previous experiences with the notices
from the Department and the correspondence from the Department, I would take it
to lean Mr. MacDougall towards the legitimate understanding that he might
reasonably expect further indication from the Department, after the appeal was
disposed of.

His Honour Judge Sullivan and the majority of
the Court of Appeal affirmed these findings and held that they disclosed a
defence to the charge here laid on the ground that they disclosed a mistake of
fact on the part of the accused within the meaning of R. v. Sault Ste. Marie
(supra), whereas I am unable to treat the respondent’s
mistake otherwise than as a mistake of law in relation to his right, because of
s. 250 (3), to drive after his appeal had been dismissed. This was a
mistake of law which does not afford the respondent a defence having regard to
s. 19  of the Criminal Code  which provides that:

19.
Ignorance of the law by a person who commits an offence is not an excuse for
committing that offence.

This is no more than a codification of the
common law rule and undoubtedly applies in the present case.

In this regard Macdonald J.A., speaking on
behalf of the Court of Appeal, introduced a new concept in the law of mistake,
saying:

On the particular facts of this case and in
light of what I have just said I am not convinced that the mistake of the respondent
as to the effective date or time of revocation of his license was purely one of
law. It was a reasonable mistake based on certain acts of the Registrar and may
be but an error of fact or a mix of both fact and law.

[Page 613]

Assuming however that the error of the
respondent as to revocation was one of law I am prepared to say that the facts
as found by the trial judge give rise to a defence of justification based upon
reliance by the respondent on a previous course of conduct on the part of the Registrar.
This defence might be classified as officially induced error or perhaps as a
form of colour of right.

It is not difficult to envisage a situation in
which an offence could be committed under mistake of law arising because of,
and therefore induced by, “officially induced error’, and if there was evidence
in the present case to support such a situation existing it might well be an
appropriate vehicle for applying the reasoning adopted by Mr. Justice
Macdonald. In the present case, however, there is no evidence that the accused
was misled by an error on the part of the Registrar. The only reference which I
have been able to find in the testimony of the accused which could even suggest
such a thing is the following passage from his cross‑examination:

Q. But in any event sir, you did receive a
notification of revocation of license on the 10th of April 1979?

A. 10th of April…

Q. Well, at least it was dated the 10th of
April?

A. Yes.

Q. At that point you knew for sure that
your license was revoked?

A. No, not exactly, on this particular, the
10th of April, yes that the license had been revoked at that particular time,
over that particular charge.

Q. So at that particular time you knew that
it was revoked?

A. Yes, on advice of the Motor Vehicle
Department.

Q. Yes, that is basically what I am asking
you, you then filed a notice of appeal in the matter, did you not?

A. Yes I did.

Q. You appealled [sic] the
decision, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. Subsequent to filing the notice of
appeal, you received a notice of reinstatement from the Registrar of Motor
Vehicles?

A. I did.

[Page 614]

Q. That was given subject to the outcome of
the appeal case?

A. Pending, restored pending outcome of
appeal.

And earlier Mr. MacDougall had given the
following evidence:

Q. Having received notice of the appeal
having been lost, Mr. MacDougall, did it at all appear to you that maybe
your license would be under suspension?

A. Well as I understood it, there would be
a notice of license suspension coming to me at sometime, yes.

Q. Did you realize that you may be under
suspension at that very moment?

A. Not at that particular time, no.

Q. You were waiting then the notification
from the Registrar of Motor Vehicles?

A. Well, as in the past, notification had
been received from Motor Vehicles, with regards to the previous accident, so I
was under the assumption that until such time as that notice would be received,
I was still able to drive a car.

It would be difficult to conceive of more clear
or imperative language than that contained in s. 250(3) of the Motor
Vehicle Act whereby the driver’s licence shall be automatically “revoked
and shall remain revoked” if an appeal is “dismissed”. The failure to
appreciate the legal duty imposed by that law is of no solace to the appellant.

Before concluding, I should make mention of R.
v. Prue, R. v. Baril, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 547, in which the majority of the
Court held that, for the purposes of the Criminal Code , whether there
has been an effective suspension is simply a question of fact. The case arose
under s. 238(3)  of the Criminal Code  and the majority decision,
delivered by the Chief Justice at p. 552, makes it clear that a
distinction may be drawn between enforcement of a driving offence under the Criminal
Code  and one for the enforcement of a provincial enactment.

In my opinion, the issue of ignorance of
fact or ignorance of law is properly applicable to the enforcement of the
provincial enactment under which the suspension

[Page 615]

from driving is made and not to the
enforcement of s. 238(3)  of the Criminal Code .

I am of the opinion that nothing in the
foregoing reasons runs counter to the decision of the Court in Prue and Baril.

For all these reasons I would allow this appeal
and order a new trial.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Drug trafficking—Restricted
drug occurring naturally in “magic mushrooms”—Restricted drug indicated to the
object of sale—Acquittal given at close of Crown’s case—Whether or not respondent
guilty of trafficking—Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27, ss. 40, 41, 42.

Respondent was charged with trafficking in a
restricted drug, Psilocybin, pursuant to s. 42(1)  of the Food and Drugs
Act . Undercover police officers had purchased “magic mushrooms”—mushrooms
in which Psilocybin occurs naturally—from him, and the conversation clearly
indicated Psilocybin to be the object of the sale. The Crown appealed the
acquittal of respondent given at the conclusion of the Crown’s case. The County
Court and the Court of Appeal both upheld that verdict.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

A properly instructed trier of fact could
have convicted respondent of trafficking in Psilocybin on the evidence before
him. The mushrooms contained Psilocybin, not merely its constituent elements.
Respondent, knowing this, offered the mushrooms for sale at a price exceeding
their value as food with the assurance that they were “good stuff”. The drug,
even though contained in mushrooms, was still restricted and the subject of a
conviction of unlawful possession. To be unlawful, however, there must be
present a knowledge of the nature of the substance possessed.

[Page 678]

R. v. Parnell (1979),

All E.R. 161, referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal, June 5, 1981, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of
the County Court of Vancouver Island, dismissing an appeal from an acquittal
rendered by Metzger P.C.J. Appeal allowed.

S. David Frankel, for the appellant.

Edward A. Holekamp, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—In this appeal the Crown seeks to
have the Court consider and overrule a judgment of the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia in R. v. Parnell (1979), 51 C.C.C. (2d) 413, and that
of the Court of Appeal for Alberta in R. v. Cartier (1980), 54 C.C.C.
(2d) 32. These cases held that mere possession of the substance known as
Psilocybin, as an integral part of the plant in which it is found in nature,
cannot support a conviction for possession of a restricted drug contrary to
s. 41(1) of the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27. The
British Columbia Court of Appeal in reaching its conclusion in Parnell accepted
the reasoning of Lord Diplock in Director of Public Prosecutions v.
Goodchild, [1978] 2 All E.R. 161, a case involving charges of possession of
various hallucinogenic substances known as cannabinol derivatives in parts of
the cannabis plant in the form in which the substance appears in nature.

The facts may be simply stated. The respondent
was charged with trafficking in a restricted drug, pursuant to s. 42(1)  of
the Food and Drugs Act , in Courtenay, British Columbia, to two under-cover
R.C.M.P. officers on November 22, 1980. The

[Page 679]

information was in these terms:

…on or about the 22nd day of November,
1980, at or near the City of Courtenay in the County of Nanaimo, in the
Province of British Columbia, did UNLAWFULLY traffic in a restricted drug, to
wit:

3-(2-(Dimethylamino)ethyl)-4-phosphoryloxyindole
(Psilocybin),

CONTRARY TO THE FORM OF THE STATUTE IN SUCH CASE
MADE AND PROVIDED:

The Crown proceeded summarily. The evidence
revealed that Dunn met the police officers by a previous arrangement in the
parking lot of a hotel. There the respondent produced a one‑pound bag of
mushrooms, which it was later shown contained the drug Psilocybin, and it was
agreed that it would be sold to the undercover officers for $3,000. A
conversation took place from which it was clear that the vendor was selling and
that the purchaser was buying Psilocybin. This conversation between the
respondent and the undercover police officers included these comments:


 
  
  Respondent:
  
  
  This
  is a pound. We weighed it out with the scales.
  
 
 
  
  Lefler:
  
  
  You’re
  sure of that, eh?
  
 
 
  
  Respondent:
  
  
  Yeah.
  
 
 
  
  Constable
  Lefler then examined the bag of mushrooms.
  
 
 
  
  Lefler:
  
  
  So
  this is the Psilocybin shit, eh.
  
 
 
  
  Respondent:
  
  
  Yeah,
  that’s the stuff. Why don’t you try a chew.
  
 
 
  
  Lefler:
  
  
  No
  thank you. I don’t do that, it makes me sick. I’m only in this for the money.
  Dennis may want to.
  
 
 
  
  Constable
  Lefler then handed the bag to Constable Boissonnault who examined it.
  
 
 
  
  Boissonnault:
  
  
  (to
  Lefler) Well, Russ, you’d better get the money.
  
 
 
  
  Boissonnault:
  
  
  (to
  the Respondent) You’re sure this is good stuff.
  
 
 
  
  Respondent:
  
  
  Why
  don’t you chew on a few, five or six. That’s for $3,000.00.
  
 


[Page 680]

The money was produced and at that moment other
police officers arrived on the scene and the respondent was arrested.

Throughout these proceedings it had been agreed
by all parties that Psilocybin is a restricted drug listed in Schedule H to the
Food and Drugs Act , that it appears in nature in some types of
mushrooms, several of which grow wild in British Columbia, and that the
mushrooms offered for sale in the case at bar did contain the drug Psilocybin.
At trial the respondent at the conclusion of the Crown’s case moved for a
dismissal of the charge on the basis that no evidence had been adduced to support
the charge. The provincial court judge, following the Parnell case, supra,
allowed the motion and acquitted the respondent. An appeal to the County
Court was dismissed on the same basis as was a further appeal to the British
Columbia Court of Appeal. The matter comes before us and the Crown asks us to
review and overrule Parnell and Cartier.

Because of the way the matter was disposed of in
the courts below, there are few findings of fact for the assistance of the
Court. There was evidence from an expert that the mushrooms contained
Psilocybin which could be extracted from the mushrooms in a somewhat
complicated process. As I understand it, the expert evidence on this question
was that the drug is found in the mushrooms in its free form. In argument before
this Court counsel for the respondent agreed that this was so. I therefore
conclude that the actual compound known as Psilocybin, not merely the
constituent elements from which it could be chemically produced, exists in the
mushrooms, and that its hallucinogenic effects may be obtained by chewing or
eating the mushrooms.

Part 4 of the Food and Drugs Act  deals
with restricted drugs. Section 40 of the Act, the first section in Part 4,
provides:

40. In this
Part

“possession” means possession as defined in
the Criminal Code ;

“regulations” means regulations made as
provided for by or under section 45;

[Page 681]

“restricted drug” means any drug or other
substance included in Schedule H;

“traffic” means to manufacture, sell,
export from or import into Canada, transport or deliver, otherwise than under the authority of this
Part or the regulations.

Schedule H appended to the Act lists the
restricted drugs and includes:

3-(2-(Dimethylamino)ethyl)-4-phosphoryloxyindole
(Psilocybin) or any salt thereof.

In Parnell Nemetz C.J.B.C., speaking for
the court (Nemetz C.J.B.C, Aikins and Lambert JJ.A.), considered a case where a
charge of possession resulted from the finding of a mushroom-like substance
containing Psilocybin in the accused’s residence. He reached the conclusion
that the simple possession of mushrooms containing the restricted drug as it
occurs in nature would not support a conviction for possession. At p. 414
of the report he said:

There is no doubt that the mushrooms found
in the possession of the respondent contained psilocybin, though there was no
evidence of what quantity of the drug was present in the mushrooms. Counsel for
the respondent submitted, first, that the mere possession of the substance
psilocybin as an integral part of the natural plant cannot support a conviction
for possession of a restricted drug, and, second, that in enacting
s. 41(1) and Sch. (H), Parliament intended to prohibit only the possession
of the separated crystalline chemical substance. After anxious reflection, and
after considering the circumstances of this case, as outlined above, I conclude
that the first submission is correct insofar as psilocybin is concerned. It is
not necessary for me to decide to what extent the second submission is correct.

He found support in the reasoning of Lord
Diplock in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Goodchild, supra, a case
based on different English legislation, but expressing the same principle. He
referred to the words of Lord Diplock at p. 166, where he said:

…the offence of unlawful possession of any
controlled drug described in Sch 2 by its scientific name is not established by
proof of possession of naturally occuring

[Page 682]

[sic] material of which the described drug
is one of the constituents unseparated from the others.

He also found support in a comparison with the
provisions of the Narcotic Control Act noting that in the Act where
Parliament intended to prohibit possession of the plant as well as the drug it
made specific provision for that result by naming the plant. He also expressed
the view that the position adopted by the Crown, that is that mere possession
of the plant containing the naturally occurring drug was sufficient to support
a conviction for possession, would lead to an absurd result opening the door to
prosecution of farmers and others who merely by an accident of nature might
have growing upon their land the nefarious ‘magic mushrooms’.

Shortly thereafter the same question was
presented to the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v. Cartier, supra. McGillivray
C.J.A. (McGillivray C.J.A., McDermid and Laycraft JJ.A.) reached the same
conclusion that Nemetz C.J.B.C. expressed in Parnell, relying as well on
the approach taken by Diplock L.J. in Goodchild, supra, and noting as
well with apparent approval the remarks of the Chief Justice of British
Columbia regarding the absurd result which could follow from the acceptance of
the Crown’s submission.

There have been other cases referring to the
question raised in this appeal from trial courts but the two appellate
decisions, Parnell and Cartier, are the leading cases on the
subject. The Parnell case in particular is sought to be overturned by
the appellant.

The Crown’s contention is that to follow the Parnell
and Cartier cases would be to render the Food and Drugs Act  nugatory
in this connection. It does not rely upon the concept of trafficking by holding
out a substance to be a restricted drug but argues that the words of the Act
and Schedule H are broad enough in themselves to include as a restricted drug
mushrooms containing in their natural state the specifically restricted drug
Psilo-

[Page 683]

cybin. The position taken by the respondent is
essentially to support the Parnell and Cartier cases and to
stress the fact that mushrooms containing Psilocybin are not mentioned as such
in Schedule H and, therefore, cannot be classified as a restricted drug.

In approaching the construction of the relevant
provisions of the Food and Drugs Act  I must observe that the words
employed are clear and unambiguous and in this case there seems to be no real
difficulty in statutory interpretation. Section 40  provides in unmistakable
language that possession means possession as defined in the Criminal Code . Reference
to s. 3(4)  of the Criminal Code  describes the elements which must
be shown to find possession. Section 40  also describes a restricted drug as
“any drug or other substance included in Schedule H” and Schedule H
specifically includes Psilocybin. Section 41  prohibits possession of a
restricted drug and s. 42 , which is the relevant section in this
case, prohibits trafficking in a restricted drug.

In reaching his conclusion on the ‘no evidence’
motion the trial judge followed Parnell and decided that there was no
evidence before him because Psilocybin contained in a mushroom is not listed in
Schedule H as a restricted drug. The question which faced him, however, was not
whether Psilocybin naturally occurring in a mushroom is listed in Schedule H
but whether there was evidence before him upon which a properly instructed
trier of fact could have found the respondent guilty of trafficking in
Psilocybin which clearly is.

In the face of the evidence given at trial and
the concession made by counsel for the respondent that Psilocybin, not merely
the constituents from which it could be made, existed in the mushrooms, it
could not be said that there was not some evidence of trafficking in
Psilocybin. The mushrooms contained the drug. There was evidence that the
respondent knew it and that he assured his prospective purchasers that it was
‘good stuff’, that

[Page 684]

he invited them to try it, and that he had
offered a pound for sale for $3,000, which would tend to exclude the
possibility that the mushrooms were to be sold for their value as food. In my
opinion, it is impossible to come to any other conclusion than that there was
evidence before the trial judge upon which a properly instructed trier of fact
could have convicted the respondent of trafficking in Psilocybin and that the
trial judge was in error in allowing the motion of no evidence.

While this disposes of the case at bar, it does
not deal with the question raised by the cases of Parnell and Cartier.
As indicated above, the case at bar was not seriously considered in the
courts below on the merits because all the judges dealing with it considered
that the Parnell case was decisive on the matter and that the
considerations involved in the charge of trafficking did not differ from those
involved in a possession charge. It will be apparent from what I have said
that, in my opinion, the fact that Psilocybin may be contained within a
mushroom does not destroy its character as a restricted drug under Schedule H
of the Food and Drugs Act . It could therefore, in my view, be as much
the subject of a conviction for possession as it could be for trafficking. If
the Parnell case and the Cartier case go so far as to deny that
proposition, then in my view, with the greatest respect for the learned judges
involved in those decisions, I consider the cases were wrongly decided. I am
not overlooking the absurdity argument which impressed the courts, but I would
point out that what is prohibited with respect to possession is unlawful
possession, not mere physical possession. To be unlawful there must be present
a knowledge of the nature of the substance possessed. The farmer who
unknowingly has ‘magic mushrooms’ growing on his land is not guilty of unlawful
possession. It would seem to me that reason and common sense on the part of the
authorities would protect him if on discovery of the nature of the mushrooms he
took the necessary steps to have them destroyed. In any event we are not here
concerned with a possession case. Our case is that of an accused charged with
trafficking in Psilocybin in respect of whom evidence was placed before the
trial judge that he had acquired the mushrooms, dried them, and offered to sell
them at

[Page 685]

$3,000 a pound. As I have said above, there was
evidence of trafficking before the learned judge and it was error to allow the
motion of no evidence. I would therefore allow the Crown’s appeal and remit the
matter to the trial court for the completion of the trial.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL OF BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Procedure—Jury—Juror
discharged—Accused not yet put in charge of jury and evidence not
called—Whether or not trial had commenced for purposes of s. 573  of the
Criminal Code —Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34, s. 573.

A juror at appellants’ trial was discharged
pursuant to s. 573  of the Criminal Code  after the jury had been
empanelled but before the accused had been put in the jury’s charge and before
any evidence had been called. The trial continued. The accused unsuccessfully
appealed their convictions arguing that the matter should not have been put to
eleven jurors. The issue before this Court was when does a jury trial begin for
the purposes of s. 573 : the Crown contended that the juror was discharged
in the course of the trial while the accused argued that the trial began only
when the accused were put in the charge of the jury.

Held: The
appeals should be allowed.

When a jury commences depends on the Criminal
Code  section being applied. An accused at common law has a right to
the unanimous verdict of twelve jurors unless or until the judge, after the
trial has commenced, is satisfied a juror should not continue to act for
reasonable cause. Any abridgment of this right, such as the practical cure in
s. 573(2)  for difficulties arising from the discharge of a juror, should
be narrowly construed. The wording of s. 573(1)  anticipated the jury’s
have acted qua jury prior to a juror’s discharge. The weight of
authority supported the position that a jury trial commenced when the accused
was placed in the jury’s

[Page 731]

charge. There was no good reason to deny the
accused a full jury where no evidence had been led.

APPEALS from a judgment of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal (1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 13, upholding the
convictions of the two accused. Appeals allowed.

Francie Howard and Peter Leask, for the
appellant Mary Evangeline Basarabas.

Clayton Ruby, Q.C., for the appellant
Jenny Louise Spek.

Leonard Doust and W.B. Smart, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The question: when does a trial
before a jury commence, for the purposes of s. 573 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. 34? The section reads:

573. (1)
Where in the course of a trial the judge is satisfied that a juror should not,
because of illness or other reasonable cause, continue to act, the judge may
discharge the juror.

(2) Where in the course of a trial a member
of the jury dies or is discharged pursuant to subsection (1), the jury
shall, unless the judge otherwise directs and if the number of jurors is not
reduced below ten, or in the Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories
below five, be deemed to remain properly constituted for all

[Page 732]

purposes of the trial and the trial shall
proceed and a verdict may be given accordingly.

At the trial of the two appellants a juror was
discharged, pursuant to s. 573, after the jury had been empanelled but
before the accused had been put in charge of the jury and before any evidence
had been called. The Crown contends that the juror was discharged “in the
course of” the trial. The accused say no, that a jury trial does not commence
until, at the earliest, the time at which the accused is put in charge of the
jury.

I

Statement of the Facts and the Judicial
History

The appellants were charged with the second
degree murder of Tristano Falbo and were found guilty after a trial by judge
and jury at the City of Vancouver.

After the appellants had entered their
respective pleas of not guilty, and after twelve jurors were sworn, but before
the appellants had been given in charge to the jury and before the Crown was
called upon to present its case, the court was informed that one of the jurors
was a fellow employee of the brother of the alleged victim. The prosecutor
suggested that the options were “to simply say goodbye” to that one juror under
s. 573(1)  of the Criminal Code  or to discharge the jury if there
was a chance that the entire jury had been “poisoned” in the jury room. Counsel
representing both appellants then indicated he had similar concerns about the
balance of the jury, agreeing that the juror in question should be removed from
the jury.

The particular juror was then questioned briefly
by the judge and by counsel for the appellants as to comments he might have
made to other jurors. Following this, the judge excused the juror and asked for
submissions as to whether the trial should be continued with eleven jurors. In
his submission, counsel for the appellants applied for a mistrial on the ground
that the balance of the jury may have been tainted. This application was
denied.

[Page 733]

The following day the jury was instructed as to
the charge facing the appellants and the plea which had been given by each upon
arraignment. The appellants were then put in the charge of the jury and the
trial proceeded with eleven jurors.

On appeal one of the points taken was that the
trial judge had erred in discharging one of the twelve jurors before the
appellants had been put in charge of the jury and in permitting eleven jurors
to give a verdict. Counsel contended that a jury trial does not commence until
the accused has been placed in the charge of the jury and therefore the
discharge of the juror did not take place during the “course” of the trial, as
provided in s. 573(1) . The Court of Appeal of British Columbia, speaking
through Mr. Justice Craig, said:

Although I think that there is much to be
said for the liberal interpretation of the word “trial,” that is, the trial
commences when the accused is arraigned and has pleaded, I think that having
regard to the views of Ritchie J., in R. v. Dennis [[1960] S.C.R. 286]
the word “trial” has a somewhat more restricted meaning in a trial involving a
jury. To what extent is the word restricted—does the trial begin when (1) the
jury has been empanelled, (2) the accused has been given in charge to jury, (3)
when the Crown begins to adduce evidence? I have concluded that for the
purposes of s. 573(1)  a trial commences when a jury has been empanelled
and is ready to hear the case and does not commence only after the accused has
been given in charge to the jury. I do not think that anything said by Ritchie
J., in R. v. Dennis precludes me from adopting this view.

The Court of Appeal rejected all other grounds
of appeal and the appeals were dismissed. Before this Court counsel, who were
not the counsel at trial, have advanced four grounds. Counsel submitted, inter
alia that the trial judge had erred in discharging the juror under the
provisions of s. 573(1)  because the discharge did not arise in the
“course” of the trial, counsel contending that in the case of a jury trial the
trial does not commence until the accused has been placed in the charge of the
jury. At the conclusion of argument Mr. Justice Ritchie, presiding,
delivered the following oral judgment for the Court:

[Page 734]

We are all of the view that the Court of
Appeal of British Columbia erred in its interpretation of s. 573(1)  and
s. 573(2)  of the Criminal Code  with respect to the question of when
a trial before a jury commenced.

The appeal is accordingly allowed, the
judgment of the Court of Appeal is set aside and a new trial ordered.

Reasons for judgment will follow at a later
date.

Hence these reasons. As we have concluded that,
by reason of the discharge of the juror, the appellants were not before a court
legally constituted to try them we will not advert to any ground of appeal
other than that raising the issue as to the time of commencement of a jury
trial. Because of error in resolving that issue the conviction must be quashed,
irrespective of the merits of the other grounds of appeal.

II

The Authorities

As Baron Alderson said in R. v. Faderman, 1
Den. C.C. 572, “Trial is a very technical word.” In its popular and general
sense a trial by jury consists of arraignment and plea, calling and swearing
the jury, the opening address of Crown counsel, the examination and cross‑examination
of witnesses for the Crown and for the defence, the closing addresses of
counsel, the judge’s charge and, last, the jury’s verdict. The cases have, by
and large, tended to give a rather more restricted meaning to the word “trial”.

Let us look first at some of the cases in this
Court. The first is Morin v. The Queen (1890), 18 S.C.R. 407. In that
case the judges were equally divided in opinion as to when a trial by jury may
be said to commence—one half of the Court holding that it commences before the
jury is sworn, and the other half after the jury is sworn. Ritchie C.J. said,
at p. 415: “…when there is a court duly constituted the prisoner being
present and given in charge to the jury his trial in my opinion commences.…”
Strong J. and Fournier J. concurred in the opinion of the Chief Justice. The
other three judges were of the opinion that the trial com-

[Page 735]

menced prior to the time mentioned by the Chief
Justice so we may take it from the judgment that at the latest the trial
commences when the jury is sworn and the accused is given in charge to the
jury.

In Giroux v. The King (1917), 56 S.C.R.
63, a majority of the Court rejected the view that upon arraignment the trial
has already commenced. The plea and the arraignment were held to be not part of
the trial.

In R. v. Dennis, [1960] S.C.R. 286,
Ritchie J. said, at p. 292:

A consideration of proceedings on trial by
jury brings to mind the fact that the trial proper does not start until the
accused is given in charge to the jury which stage is, of course, not reached
until after the plea has been taken and the adoption of this more restricted
meaning of the word “trial” has been widely accepted in our own Courts for many
years.

In the more recent case of R. v. Riddle, [1980]
1 S.C.R. 380, the accused had been charged with common assault. He pleaded not
guilty and the matter was adjourned for trial. At the trial the Crown applied
for an adjournment as the complainant was not present. The application was
refused. As the Crown called no evidence the charge was dismissed. A week later
the complainant swore a new information and the question was whether the
accused had been in jeopardy in the earlier proceedings. The case was a
non-jury summary conviction matter. This Court held, at p. 398:

In my view, a criminal trial commences and
an accused is normally in jeopardy from the moment issue is joined before a
judge having jurisdiction and the prosecution is called upon to present its
case in court. The person accused continues in jeopardy until final
determination of the matter by rendering of the verdict.

In R. v. Chabot, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 985, one
of the questions which the Court was called upon to decide was whether the
existence of an indictment at some time operated as a bar to an attack, by way
of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, upon the validity of a
committal for trial. Specifically,

[Page 736]

at what point could it be said that an
indictment brought under s. 507(2) of the Code is “presented” to
the court. We held, at p. 992:

I agree with counsel for the Crown that
where an indictment is preferred pursuant to s. 507 without the
intervention of the grand jury, there are not separate acts of preferral of a
bill of indictment, and presentment of an indictment. There is but one act,
that act being the placing by the appropriate authority of “an indictment in
writing setting forth the offence” before the trial court. This act constitutes
the commencement of the trial and is a combination of the steps of preferral
and presentment.

Petersen v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 493, was another case in which the question arose as
to when an accused was in jeopardy. In Petersen the Crown commenced
proceedings by indictment after dismissal of informations in identical terms by
a provincial court judge under Part XXIV of the Code. The appellant was
charged with impaired driving and with refusal to furnish a sample of his
breath. The Court, speaking through Mr. Justice McIntyre, after quoting
the passage from Riddle which I have set out above, said at p. 501:

I do not consider that Dickson J. imposed
by those words a requirement that some direct invitation must be issued to the
Crown to call evidence before it could be said that the issue had been joined
and the accused placed in jeopardy. The authorities he relied upon in his
reasons support the proposition that once a plea is entered before a court of
competent jurisdiction the accused is in jeopardy.

A number of English cases have dealt with the
question of when a trial commences. The earliest to which I would refer is R.
v. Faderman, supra, where the prisoner argued that the trial commenced when
the prisoner was called upon to plead. Baron Parke said, at p. 574:

Properly, there is no trial till issue is
joined. [This I take to mean until the prisoner is given in charge to the jury]

Alderson B. said, at p. 575:

[Page 737]

You say the trial begins with the
arraignment: how then do you explain the question which is put to the prisoner
after arraignment.—How will you be tried? At what point in the
proceedings did the trial by battle begin?

In R. v. Craske, [1957] 2 All E.R. 772,
s. 24 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act, 1952 fell to be considered.
The section read:

…a magistrates’ court, having begun to try
an information for any indictable offence summarily, shall not thereafter
proceed to inquire into the information as examining justices.

Counsel for the prosecutor contended that when
the prisoner elected and pleaded the trial had started and the magistrate had
begun to try the case. Lord Goddard C.J. responded, at p. 774:

If one looks at the whole scope of this
section, however, the magistrate has not begun to try the case until at any
rate he begins to hear the evidence. I cannot think that Parliament, by these
sections, meant to create a wholly different state of affairs in magistrates’
courts with regard to indictable offences than prevails at an assize or quarter
session with regard to indictable offences. A prisoner who is brought up for
trial and has had the indictment read to him and who has pleaded is constantly
allowed to withdraw his plea, and he can do it before the jury is empanelled.
The trial at assizes does not, so it seems to me, begin until the jury is
empanelled to try the case and the prisoner is put in charge of the jury.

In Ibrahim’s case (1957), 42 Cr.App.R.
38, Lord Chief Justice Goddard followed R. v. Craske holding, at
p. 42, that a magistrate “has not begun to try the case till he begins to
hear evidence”. See also R. v. Bennett, [1960] 1 W.L.R. 102, to the same
effect.

As I have earlier indicated, counsel for the
accused in the case at bar contended that a jury trial did not commence until,
at the earliest, the accused was given in charge of the jury. The Crown relied
upon the abbreviated summary of R. v. Desai, reported at [1973]
Crim.L.R. 36, reading:

[Page 738]

Although giving a defendant in charge to
the jury is a traditional part of trial procedure it is not an essential part
of the trial and failure to do so does not render the trial a nullity.

Following argument on the appeal the Court was
furnished with a copy of the entire judgment in R. v. Desai from which
it appears that the accused was convicted of conspiracy to contravene the
provisions of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1962 and 1968. One of his
complaints was that he had not formally been put in charge of the jury. The
Clerk of the Peace merely announced the title of the suit by saying “The Queen
against Ebrahim Mohamed Desai”, sat down and prosecuting counsel opened the
case to the jury.

The Court held:

Technically it appears there was a lacuna
in the trial in the sense that what is normally done was not done; but, in the
judgment of this Court, this is, though an omission, an omission rather in the
character of omitting the allocutus; the cases on that topic indicate that
while this is part of the traditional business of the Court, it is not an
essential part of the trial and its omission does not involve a re-trial.

I do not think the Desai case provides an
answer to the contentions of the appellants. The case simply decides that
failure to put an accused in the charge of a jury does not render a trial a
nullity. The case is not authority for the proposition that the giving of the
accused in charge to the jury is a step that no longer exists. Nor is it
authority for the question of when a jury trial commences.

Many cases from the provincial courts were cited
in argument. I will refer briefly to a number of these cases. The first of
these, referred to in the judgments of this court in Morin and Giroux
is Re Walsh (1914), 23 C.C.C. 7. Graham E.J. delivered the principal
judgment. The issue concerned s. 827  of the Criminal Code , 1906,
and the right of re-election which might be exercised “at any time before such
trial has commenced”. The question then to be answered was—when does a trial
com-

[Page 739]

mence? Graham E.J., at p. 17, referred to
Story J. in United States v. Curtis, 4 Mason 232 at 236:

Now, in the sense of the common law the
arraignment of the prisoner constitutes no part of the trial. It is a
preliminary proceeding and, until the party has pleaded, it cannot be ascertained
whether there will be any trial or not. The elementary books are full to this
purpose.

and, at p. 18, to Blackstone, quoting Lord
Hale:

In short, so far as authorities or
reasoning or forms go, there can be no legal doubt that, by the term “trial,”
is generally intended in the law, the actual trial of the prisoner by jury.

The Alberta Supreme Court in R. v. Miller (1958),
120 C.C.C. 335, interpreted s. 697  of the Criminal Code  which
permitted a summary conviction court, “at any time before the trial” to waive
jurisdiction over the proceedings in favour of another summary conviction
court. Johnson J.A. said, at p. 339, “There is no doubt that “trial”
begins with the hearing of the evidence.” On the other hand, in the Quebec
decision, Clement v. The Queen (1955), 22 C.R. 290, another
election case, the court would seem to have been of the view that the trial
commences after a plea of not guilty.

R. v. Emkeit (1971),
3 C.C.C. (2d) 309, is a useful case because s. 553 (now s. 573), the
section of the Code under consideration in the present case, was
under study. The jury was chosen and sworn, and the accused was put in their
charge. Sometime later, before counsel for the Crown had opened the case, the
trial judge discharged one of the twelve jurors pursuant to then s. 553
and the question was whether the juryman was discharged in the course of the
trial or prior thereto, or in other words, when did the trial commence. Smith
C.J.A. delivering the judgment of the Court held that the trial commenced when
the jury was sworn and the accused was given in charge to the jury. Discharge
of the juror was therefore made in the “course of the trial” and the trial
judge was entitled to do this.

[Page 740]

In R. v. Hatton (1978), 39 C.C.C. (2d)
281, Martin J.A. delivered the judgment of the Court and, in the course of
doing so, referred (at p. 289) to the “well-established rule that a trial
by jury commences when the accused is given in charge to the jury”. Emkeit,
Morin and Dennis were quoted in support of this proposition. The
Alberta Supreme Court, Appellate Division, in R. v. Blair and Karashowsky (1975),
25 C.C.C. (2d) 47, held that at the moment when a prisoner is given in charge
the trial commences. In R. v. Parker (1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 161, another
discharge of a juror case, DuPont J. held at p. 163 that s. 573(1) 
“contemplates discharge after the empanelling of a complete jury and after the
accused are given in the jury’s charge”.

III

Conclusion

The question of fixing the time of the
commencement of a jury trial has been the subject of some difficulty in the
past. It seems possible, however, on the authorities and on principle to reach
the following conclusions.

First, the time of commencement of a jury trial
will vary according to the circumstances and the language of the
section of the Criminal Code  being applied. Thus, the word “trial”
in s. 577(1)  which assures the accused the right to be present “during the
whole of his trial” will be liberally construed to afford the accused the right
to be present during the selection of the jury. In like manner, the word
“trial” in s. 566  which denies the prosecutor the right to direct a juror
to stand by on the trial of an indictment for the publication of a defamatory
libel will be interpreted to embrace the proceedings preceding the empanelling
of the jury. In other sections “trial” may have a different connotation
depending upon the section of the Code being applied.

Second, subject to s. 573 an accused in a
criminal jury trial is entitled to be tried by twelve jurors (ss. 560(5) and
572(1) of the Code). He is entitled to the unanimous verdict of
the twelve jurors unless and until “in the course of a trial”, that is to say,
after it has commenced, the judge is satisfied

[Page 741]

that a juror should not, because of illness or
other reasonable cause, continue to act.

Third, as counsel for the appellant Basarabas
submits, s. 573(2)  of the Criminal Code  is a provision that
provides a practical cure for the difficulties inherent in having to discharge
a jury after it has commenced to hear the evidence and, in so far as this
section deprives the accused of his common law right to the unanimous
verdict of twelve persons, it should be narrowly construed; there is no good
reason for denying an accused a full jury where no evidence has been led. An
accused should not be lightly deprived of his or her right to be tried by a
jury of twelve persons. It would be undesirable to start a trial with less than
that number. As counsel submitted, s. 573 of the Code provides a
mechanism whereby jurors can be replaced simply and easily to maintain a full
jury as late in the proceedings as is consistent with fairness to the parties.
To advance in time the stage when the trial is forced to proceed with one juror
missing, beyond that required by common sense and the plain language of the Code,
is to increase the likelihood, in a lengthy trial, should other jurors fall
ill, that mistrials will have to be declared the requisite number of jurors is
lacking.

Fourth, the words “continue to act” in
s. 573(1)  suggest that the jury has been acting, qua jury before
the discharge of a juror pursuant to s. 573. Until the accused is placed
in the jury’s charge, and the jury is advised of the charge and the plea and of
their duty to inquire whether the accused is guilty or not guilty of the
offence charged, it cannot be said that the jury is acting qua jury.

Finally, the weight of authority supports the
position of the accused that a jury trial commences when the accused has been
placed in charge of the jury. Canadian courts have frequently cited the
judgment of Ritchie C.J. in support of a narrow interpretation of the word
“trial” in respect of a jury trial.

[Page 742]

It is for these reasons the Court concluded that
the Court of Appeal of British Columbia had erred in its interpretation of
s. 573(1)  and s. 573(2)  of the Criminal Code  and that a new
trial should be ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Theft—Criminal breach of
trust—Misuse of trust funds.

The appellant, a lawyer, was charged with
nine counts of criminal breach of trust and nine counts of theft. He was
convicted on seven counts of theft and acquitted on the remainder, including
all the counts of criminal breach of trust. The appellant appealed his
conviction and sentence on the theft charges and the Crown appealed his
acquittal on the criminal breach of trust charges. The Manitoba Court of Appeal
allowed the appellant’s appeal from his conviction on the charges of theft and
ordered the entry of an acquittal on those counts and on the same day allowed
the Crown’s appeal against the verdict of acquittal on the charges relating to
the criminal breach of trust and ordered that the acquittal be set aside and
that convictions be entered on the charges of criminal breach of trust.

Held (Mclntyre
and Wilson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should de dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Estey J.: The Manitoba Court of Appeal correctly concluded that the
trial judge erred in law in acquitting the accused of criminal breach of trust.
The Crown was entitled to appeal to the Court to have the judgment below
reviewed.

Per Beetz and
Chouinard JJ.: We agree with the conclusion reached by the Chief Justice that
this appeal must be dismissed.

Per Lamer J.:
For the future, whenever a court is of the view that the principle laid down in
Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, should be applied, the
court should enter a stay of proceedings instead of entering the acquittal.

[Page 906]

Per Mclntyre
and Wilson JJ., dissenting: The Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to
consider the Crown’s cross-appeal on the criminal breach of trust charges since
any error the trial judge might have made was one of fact and not of law. The
Court of Appeal’s decision in allowing the appellant’s appeal on the theft
charges and the Crown’s cross-appeal on the criminal breach of trust charges was
based in part on the Kienapple principle—one of no application if the
appeal on the criminal breach of trust charges is allowed. The theft charges
should therefore be remitted to the Court of Appeal for a hearing and
determination on the merits.

[R. v. Olan et al., [1978] 2 S.C.R.
1175; Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, referred to.]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Manitoba
Court of Appeal, May 12, 1979, reversing a judgment of the County Court. Appeal
dismissed, Mclntyre and Wilson JJ. dissenting.

John Sinclair, for the appellant.

John Montgomery, Q.C., and E.P.
Schachter, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Estey J. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—I am of the opinion that the
Manitoba Court of Appeal was correct in concluding that the trial judge had
erred in law in acquitting the accused on his findings that there was no
criminal breach of trust. Having regard to his findings, he should have found
the accused guilty. The Crown was therefore entitled to take an appeal to the Manitoba
Court of Appeal and to have the judgment below reviewed. The Court of Appeal
found that there was a sufficient element of deprivation on proof of risk of
prejudice to the economic interests of the clients of the accused, according to
the principle expressed in R. v. Olan et al., [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1175. I
would not interfere with that view. Accordingly the appeal fails and must be
dismissed.

The following are the reasons delivered by

BEETZ J.—I agree with the conclusion of the
Chief Justice that this appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 907]

The reasons of Mclntyre and Wilson JJ. were
delivered by

MCINTYRE J. (dissenting)—The appellant, a
Winnipeg lawyer, was charged in one information sworn on December 15, 1977 with
nine counts of criminal breach of trust and nine counts of theft. He was
committed for trial on preliminary hearing and went to trial on
October 10, 1978 in the County Court judge’s criminal court for the
Eastern Judicial District of Manitoba. He pleaded not guilty to all counts and
after a twenty-three day trial he was convicted on seven of the theft counts
and acquitted on the remainder, including all the counts of criminal breach of
trust. He was sentenced to thirty months’ imprisonment.

The appellant appealed his conviction and
sentence on the theft charges, and the Crown appealed his acquittal on the
criminal breach of trust charges. The Manitoba Court of Appeal on May 12, 1981
heard both appeals, allowed the appellant’s appeal from his conviction on the
charges of theft and ordered the entry of an acquittal on those counts and set
aside the sentence. On the same day it allowed the Crown’s appeal against the
verdicts of acquittal on the charges relating to criminal breach of trust and
ordered that the acquittals be set aside, that convictions be entered on the
charges of criminal breach of trust, and imposed a sentence of thirty months’
imprisonment.

In dismissing the breach of trust charges, the
trial judge reviewed certain cases which had been cited in argument and
recognized, as Dickson J. said in R. v. Olan et al., [1978] 2
S.C.R. 1175, that the element of deprivation involved in breach of trust
is satisfied on proof of detriment, prejudice, or risk of prejudice to the
economic interests of the victim. He then commented that:

It is not essential that there be actual
economic loss as the outcome of fraud.

[Page 908]

He referred also to another decision: R. v.
J.W.D. (1932), 38 R. de J. 481, for the proposition that “the mere fact
that the cestuis que trust are not in fact deprived of any rights or property
does not affect the position if in fact the accused has misappropriated trust
property with intent to defraud them”. Section 296, he noted, required proof of
an intent to defraud. After referring to the history of the appellant’s dealing
with clients’ funds and having found that he “followed a pattern of using one
client’s funds sometimes to pay another”, he said:

Having established this pattern, I find it
difficult to make a decision that the intent to defraud on these facts is
proved beyond a reasonable doubt. On all counts I am dismissing the charge
under 296 of intent to defraud … of criminal breach of trust.

In my view, the trial judge dismissed the fraud
charges because he was not satisfied on the element of ‘intent to defraud’
required for a conviction under s. 296  of the Criminal Code . The
Crown’s appeal was taken pursuant to s. 605 of the Code and was
limited, therefore, to a question of law alone. The Crown in its notice of
appeal endeavoured to place the matter upon two questions of law in these
terms:

1. That the learned trial Judge erred in
law in holding that the intent to defraud in a criminal breach of trust is
founded upon intent to repay, and not upon the intent to breach the terms of
the trust;

2. That the learned trial Judge erred in
law in that, having made the findings of fact that he did, he failed to infer
from those findings the intent to defraud in the offence of a criminal breach
of trust.

With the utmost deference to counsel for the
Crown, who framed these grounds, and to the Court of Appeal, which gave them
effect, I am unable to read the reasons of the trial judge so that effect could
be given to those grounds as questions of law. The trial judge’s reasons
indicate that he correctly appreciated the nature of the offence of criminal
breach of trust and that he did not base his decision on any error in that
respect. Any error

[Page 909]

he may have made in dismissing the charges
because of the absence of an intent to defraud was one of fact, not law, and
there was no jurisdiction in the Court of Appeal to hear the Crown’s appeal.

The theft charges were laid under s. 283  of
the Criminal Code . In convicting on them the trial judge said:

It would seem to me that in the facts of
this case Mr. Hammerling acted deliberately, he knew the owner of the
property, he knew he had no right to use it and as I find, he didn’t have the
funds, even on his own evidence, he didn’t have the funds to meet the
obligations respectively at the time. I can only conclude therefore, the
offence of theft has been committed by the accused on counts 4, 6, 8, 10, 12
and 18.

The appellant’s appeal to the Manitoba Court of
Appeal on the theft charges was taken under the provisions of s. 603  of
the Criminal Code  and was, therefore, properly before the Court of
Appeal which had jurisdiction to hear it. The Court of Appeal allowed the
appeals against conviction and in doing so Freedman C.J.M. said:

Although we have found both criminal breach
of trust and theft, we are all of the view that this is a case for the
application of the Kienapple principle, namely that there should not be
double convictions or double penalties for offences based on the same facts.

Accordingly, we would allow the Crown’s
cross-appeal relating to the criminal breach of trust charges. The accused’s
appeal against conviction on the theft charges, although not entitled to
succeed on the merits, is allowed by the operation of the Kienapple
principle. In the result convictions will be entered only on the criminal
breach of trust counts involved in the cross-appeal.

The result must be then that the Court of
Appeal’s allowance of the Crown’s appeal against the acquittals at trial on the
criminal breach of trust charges must be set aside for lack of jurisdiction and
the acquittals restored. The appellant’s appeal against the theft convictions
was allowed by

[Page 910]

the Court of Appeal, but the allowance appears
to have been based, at least in part, on the application of the Kienapple principle.
Kienapple has no application if the appellant’s appeal on the criminal
breach of trust charges is allowed. No appeal to this Court was taken in
respect of them and this Court is therefore in no position to deal with them on
the merits. I would accordingly remit the theft charges to the Court of Appeal for
a hearing, if necessary, and a determination of the appellant’s appeal to that
court on the merits.

The following are the reasons delivered by

CHOUINARD J.—I agree with the conclusion of the
Chief Justice that this appeal must be dismissed.

The following are the reasons delivered by

LAMER J.—I agree with the Chief Justice, for the
reasons given by him, that this appeal fails and must be dismissed.

I am also of the view that, for the purpose of
disposing of this case, had we allowed this appeal, the interest of justice
would then best be served by, proceeding as suggested by our brother Mclntyre,
that is by remitting the theft charges to the Manitoba Court of Appeal for a
hearing and determination of the appellant’s appeal to that Court on the
merits.

But, as regards the future, this Court’s
decision in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, should be
reconsidered and modified to the following extent: whenever a court is of the
view that the principles laid down in Kienapple should be applied, the
court should enter a stay of the proceedings, in the stead of entering the
acquittal.

This way of proceeding has two advantages.
First, it avoids situations such as that which we are facing in the present
case where a Court of Appeal is being ordered to reconsider an acquittal though
no appeal was taken from that decision, and understandably so. But, secondly,
the more fundamental reason is that, whilst a person should not be convicted
more than once for essentially the

[Page 911]

same conduct, such a principle does not of
necessity have as a corollary, when multiple charges are laid and a conviction
entered on one of them, his right to an acquittal on all others. A stay fully
accommodates the policy consideration underlining this Court’s decision in Kienapple
whilst avoiding entering an acquittal notwithstanding proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of conduct that constitutes guilt of a crime.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Evidence—Opinion evidence—Non-expert
witnesses—Impaired driving—Degree of intoxication—Whether police officers and
other witnesses opinions as to impairment of accused admissible—Criminal Code,
R.S.C 1970, c. C-34 as amended, s. 234.

The trial judge accepted the opinion evidence of two police
officers that the appellant’s ability to drive had been impaired by alcohol and
convicted him under s. 234  of the Criminal Code . Appellant’s appeals to
the County Court and the Court of Appeal were dismissed. This appeal is to
determine whether a court may admit opinion evidence on the question to be
decided—here, whether the appellant’s ability to drive had been impaired by alcohol.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The question whether a person’s ability to drive was impaired
by alcohol is one of fact, not of law, and non-expert witnesses may give
evidence as to the degree of a person’s impairment. The guidance of an expert
is unnecessary. The value of opinion will depend on the view the court takes in
all the circumstances. The judges, however, should not consider the opinion of
police officers in a preferential way merely because they may have extensive
experience with impaired drivers. Here, the non-expert evidence was correctly
admitted. The witnesses all had an opportunity for personal observations. They
were not deciding a matter for the court to decide as the weight of the
evidence is entirely a matter for the judge who could accept all or part or
none of their evidence.

Douglas C. Hunt, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—This appeal raises the issue whether on a charge of
driving while impaired the Court may admit opinion evidence on the very
question to be decided, namely, was the accused’s ability to drive impaired by
alcohol at the time and place stated in the charge.

I

The Procedural History

The appellant, Anthony Graat, was charged on August 10, 1978 at
the City of London, County of Middlesex, while his ability to drive a motor
vehicle was impaired by alcohol, he did drive a motor vehicle, contrary to s.
234  of the Criminal Code . He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to a
fine of $300 or, in default, imprisonment for 30 days. An appeal to the County
Court was dismissed. Leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario was
granted but the appeal was dismissed. The matter is now, by leave, before this
Court.

[Page 821]

II

The Facts

At approximately 2:15 a.m. on the date in question, Constables
Case and McMullen of the London City Police observed Mr. Graat’s vehicle
travelling at a high rate of speed. The constables followed for several blocks.
They observed Mr. Graat’s car weaving in the southbound lane, crossing the
centre line on two occasions and driving onto the shoulder of the road on
another occasion. When the vehicle turned left it straddled the centre line.

Both constables testified they noticed the smell of alcohol on
the appellant’s breath; both said Mr. Graat was unsteady on his feet, he
staggered as he walked, and had bloodshot eyes.

At the police station Mr. Graat was observed by a Sergeant
Spoelstra. The sergeant testified he smelled alcohol on the appellant’s breath,
the top part of his body was swaying, and his walk was “kind of wavy”.

Mr. Graat complained of chest pains. He told the police he
suffered from a heart condition and asked to be taken to a hospital. The police
complied. By the time Mr. Graat returned to the police station it was too
late to take two breath samples because the two-hour time limit for the taking
of such samples had expired or was about to expire.

Mr. Graat testified he had had two drinks of gin between the
hours of 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., and two glasses of wine with his dinner about
 11:00 p.m. He said he and two friends, George Wilson and Vincent O’Donovan,
were returning from a sailing party; he became tired. Wilson drove the car
while he dozed in the back seat. The appellant resumed driving after Wilson had
driven O’Donovan and himself home. Wilson testified that if he had thought
Mr. Graat was not in a fit condition to drive he would have asked him to
stay at his, Wilson’s, house.

At trial Constable Case was asked the following questions and
gave the following answers:

[Page 822]

Q. All right, now what, if any, opinion having made those
observations, what if any opinion did you form regarding the accused man’s
ability to drive a motor vehicle?

A. I formed the opinion that the accused’s ability was impaired.

Q. By?

A. By alcohol.

Q. You said the accused man’s ability to what?

A. To drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.

Constable McMullen was asked the following question:

Q. Now officer when you were at the scene and having made
the observations of the driving of the accused man, having observed him, having
smelled the alcoholic beverage on his breath and observed him walk and observed
him standing, observed him speaking to you what, if any, conclusion did you
come to regarding his ability to drive a motor vehicle?

A. It was in my opinion that the accused’s ability to
operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol beverage.

Sergeant Spoelstra, the desk sergeant, gave similar evidence:

Q. …You saw him standing and you saw him walking. What, if
any opinion, did you form regarding his ability to drive a motor vehcile?

A. In my opinion the accused’s ability was impaired by the
use of alcohol to drive a motor vehicle.

No objection was taken at trial to the admission of any of this
evidence. Indeed, at the conclusion of the examination in chief of Sergeant
Spoelstra, the following exchange took place:

MR. ALLAN: [Crown Counsel]

Your witness.

Q. Oh, wait a minute, what if any opinion, did you form
regarding his ability to drive a motor vehicle from what you saw?

A. From what I saw.

THE COURT:

Just one moment, please. This man’s a desk sergeant, he’s
not the man in the field, so to speak. Do you say I should permit him to give
his opinion?

[Page 823]

MR. ALLAN:

Your Honour, with respect, even if he didn’t see the accused
man driving, if the sergeant…

MR. SILVER: [then counsel for the defence]

I can save time, Your Honour, I’m quite content with it.

THE COURT:

Thank you. Proceed.

I do not think failure on the part of defence counsel to object
to the admission of inadmissible evidence should, in the circumstances of this
case, stand in the way of directing a new trial if such evidence is held to be
inadmissible.

The trial judge preferred the evidence of the police witnesses to
the evidence of Mr. Graat and Mr. Wilson. In particular, the judge
relied on the evidence of Constable McMullen and Sergeant Spoelstra, policemen
for 8 and 17 years respectively. Constable Case had only been a police officer
for a few months, and had only charged two or three persons with impaired
driving. The judge said he accepted the opinions of officers McMullen and
Spoelstra in reaching his conclusion that the accused’s ability to drive was
impaired:

I’m of the view that I’m entitled to accept and I do accept
the opinions of those two police officers on the issue of impairment as part of
the totality of the evidence.

On the appeal to the County Court, Judge McNab concluded there
was direct evidence upon which the trial judge was justified in making a
finding that the ability of the appellant to drive was impaired.

III

The Ontario Court of Appeal

The appellant sought leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario
and at that time the question was raised as to whether the trial judge had
erred in law in relying on the opinion evidence of the two police officers that
the appellant’s ability to drive a motor vehicle had been impaired by alcohol.

[Page 824]

The Court dismissed the appeal, saying that the evidence was
admissible under the exception to the rule excluding opinion evidence:

…that permits non-expert opinion evidence where the primary
facts and the inferences to be drawn from them are so closely associated that
the opinion is really a compendious way of giving evidence as to certain
facts—in this case the condition of the appellant.

This echoes the words of Parke B. in Wright v. Tatham (1838),
4 Bing. N.C. 489 (at pp. 543‑44):

…and though the opinion of a witness upon oath, as to that
fact [testamentary capacity], might be asked, it would only be a compendious
mode of ascertaining the result of the actual observation of the witness, from
acts done, as to the habits and demeanour of the deceased.

On behalf of the Court of Appeal Chief Justice Howland delivered
a lengthy, scholarly, judgment exhaustively reviewing academic opinion and case
law relating to the exclusion of opinion evidence. He began with a passage from
Cross on Evidence, 5th ed., 1979, at p. 442:

In the law of evidence ‘opinion’ means any inference from
observed facts, and the law on the subject derives from the general rule that
witnesses must speak only to that which was directly observed by them. The
treatment of evidence of opinion by English law is based on the assumption that
it is possible to draw a sharp distinction between inferences and the facts on
which they are based. The drawing of inferences is said to be the function of
the judge or jury, while it is the business of a witness to state facts.

The Chief Justice then spoke of two categories of opinion
evidence that has traditionally been admissible: (i) cases calling for expert
testimony in matters requiring specialized skill and knowledge, the only
questions being whether the subject matter called for expertise and whether the
witness was a qualified expert; (ii) non-expert opinion on matters requiring no
special knowledge, where it is virtually impossible to separate the witness’
inference from the facts on which the inference is based. In the opinion of the
Chief Justice, the admission of opinion evidence in the latter circum-

[Page 825]

stance is merely a compendious way of ascertaining the result of
the witness’ observations.

After canvassing the case law in this country and a number of
other countries, Chief Justice Howland summed up in the following passage:

In my opinion, impairment is a degree of drunkenness. It is
a compendious way of describing a condition based on observed facts. It does
not require the evidence of a doctor or other expert, nor should it be limited
to persons who themselves drive cars. It is a subject about which most people
should be able to express an opinion from their ordinary day-to-day experience
of life. To testify that a person is impaired is really tantamount to saying “I
don’t think that he should have been driving”. In each case the opinion must be
based on the observed facts: the car was weaving back and forth across the
road, there was a strong odour of alcohol on the driver’s breath, his powers of
perception and coordination were poor, he was drowsy and was not reacting
quickly to other cars or pedestrians in the path of his car, and so on. To
exclude such non‑expert evidence of witnesses who were passengers in the
car of the accused or of other cars in the vicinity or who were pedestrians may
result in an injustice to the accused and may at the same time impede the
police in the prosecution of impaired drivers. Such evidence should be
admissible. The weight to be given to such inferential testimony will vary from
witness to witness, depending on the observed facts on which it is based.

The learned Chief Justice rejected the “ultimate issue” doctrine,
i.e. that an opinion can never be received when it touches the very
issue before the jury. He also noted that opinion evidence is properly rejected
when it involves a legal component, such as the question of whether a person
had acted negligently.

The judgment concludes:

In my opinion the trial judge did not err in admitting as
non-expert testimony the opinion evidence of the police officers as to
impairment, and in relying on it as part of the totality of the evidence.
Having reached this conclusion, it is not necessary to consider whether the
police officers could have qualified as experts and what evidence would have
been necessary for this purpose.

[Page 826]

Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted, but the appeal is
dismissed.

IV

The Case Law

The question in issue is a vexed one. The authorities in this
country and elsewhere are by no means congruous. One of the earliest, and most
frequently quoted cases is R. v. German (1947), 89 C.C.C. 90, a decision
of the Ontario Court of Appeal involving charges of dangerous driving and
driving while intoxicated. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the Crown
was improperly permitted to introduce opinion evidence of persons who had no
special qualifications. This evidence related to whether the accused was
intoxicated, and was in a fit condition to drive. The Court observed that there
were several matters on which a person of ordinary intelligence may be
permitted to give opinion evidence based on his personal knowledge, such as the
identity of individuals, the apparent age of a person, the speed of a vehicle
and whether a person was sober or not.

Robertson C.J.O. said (at p. 99):

I am sure there have been many cases where a witness has
been asked whether a person was sober or not, and has been allowed to state
what is after all, a matter of opinion, but the answer is given as if nothing
but a mere question of fact was involved.

In the present case the evidence objected to is that of
witnesses who saw the appellant and had opportunity of observing him. While
some of the questions allowed to be answered were, I think, improperly framed,
it was quite plain to the jury that these witnesses were ordinary observers
applying their unskilled knowledge to what they actually saw, and, taken as a
whole, I do not think any injustice was done by the occasional putting of a
question that was unfortunately framed.

The case is of limited help as the degree of impairment
was not really in issue.

German’s case was discussed in R. v. Marks, [1952]
O.W.N. 608, in which it was held that it was for the judge to decide whether in
the light of the facts the police officer was “competent” to

[Page 827]

give an opinion as to any condition of impairment by consumption
of alcohol. On the evidence in that case the judge held that the officers were
not competent because they did not actually observe the accused driving his car
and because they disagreed both about the state of intoxication and about the
accused’s ability to drive.

The next case is R. v. Zarins (1959), 125 C.C.C. 375,
another impaired driving case, the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal
being delivered by Porter C.J.O. Two short passages might be quoted (at pp. 380
and 382):

I would adopt certain language of Harvey C.J.A. in R. v.
Cox 93 Can.C.C. 32 at p. 36, [1949] 1 D.L.R. 524 at p. 528, and say that
the fact of intoxication under s. 222, and impairment under s. 223 “may well be
determined by observance of the conduct of the person charged as to which
anyone can speak.”

and

Following this decision [the decision in R. v. German,
supra], I think that the evidence of the police officers as to
intoxication and impairment was clearly admissible.

From the Ontario authorities one would conclude that opinion
evidence as to drunkenness, and as to impairment, are currently both
admissible.

In British Columbia (R. v. Beauvais, [1965] 3 C.C.C. 281
(B.C.S.C.)) McFarlane J. adopted the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Ontario
in R. v. German and held that the opinions of the constables was
lawfully admissible evidence on which the magistrate could find impairment.

In Alberta, it has been held that the constables could describe
the accused’s actions, appearance, language and general conduct and, in answer
to a question framed as a question of fact, state the accused was drunk: R.
v. Pollock (1947), 90 C.C.C. 171. In R. v. Cox (1948), 93 C.C.C., 32
(Alta. C.A.), Harvey C.J.A., delivering the judgment of the Court, said (at pp.
35-36):

[Page 828]

It seems clear, however, that the purpose of the,
prohibition of s. 285 is for the protection of people on the highway, and that
when a person is in such a state of intoxication that his driving is a menace
to the public safety, he must be intoxicated within the intention, and
therefore the meaning, of the term as used in the section.

That fact may well be determined by observance of the
conduct of the person charged as to which anyone can speak, and that too
perhaps with greater certainty than by any conclusions from the percentage of
alcohol in the blood.

In some of the other provinces the position is more narrowly
circumscribed. For example, in Prince Edward Island, Campbell C.J. held in Giddings
v. The King (1947), 89 C.C.C. 346 that, in cases where intoxication is the
very issue, it is neither helpful nor permissible for witnesses to state their
own opinions or conclusions as to the fact or degree of intoxication, at least
unless they relate the detailed symptoms on which their conclusions are based.
In R. v. Smith (1948), 17 Fortnightly L.J. 241, the same judge held that
only evidence of actual symptoms could be regarded, and evidence that the
accused was intoxicated should be eliminated. An equally restrictive view was
taken by Hogarth D.C.J. in Grimsteit v. McDonald (1950), 96 C.C.C. 272:
“My opinion has always been that it is for a witness to state the facts and for
the Court to draw conclusions from those facts” (at p. 286).

A midway position was voiced by O’Hearn C.C.J. in R. v.
MacDonald (1966), 9 Crim. L.Q. 239 (at p. 241):

I ruled that it would probably be improper for the witness
to give as his opinion that the defendant’s ability to drive a motor vehicle
was impaired by alcohol or a drug, as this might involve a conclusion of law,
but that any adult person with sufficient experience of the world may be asked
his opinion of a person’s condition with respect to intoxication.

England

Lord Parker, speaking on behalf of the Court-Martial Appeal Court
in R. v. Davies, [1962] 1 W.L.R. 1111 was of opinion that a witness
could

[Page 829]

properly give his impression as to whether another had “taken
drink”, but could not testify as to fitness or unfitness to drive. He reached
his conclusion on two grounds (i) he is not in the expert witness category;
(ii) that was the very matter the court had to determine on a charge of driving
a vehicle on a road while unfit to drive through drink or drugs. The passage
reads (at p. 1113):

The court has come clearly to the conclusion that a witness
can quite properly give his general impression as to whether a driver had taken
[a] drink. He must describe of course the facts upon which he relies, but it
seems to this court that he is perfectly entitled to give his impression as to
whether drink had been taken or not. On the other hand, as regards the second
matter, it cannot be said, as it seems to this court, that a witness, merely
because he is a driver himself, is in the expert witness category so that it is
proper to ask him his opinion as to fitness or unfitness to drive. That is the
very matter which the court itself has to determine. Accordingly, in so far as
this witness and two subsequent witnesses, the lance-corporal and the
regimental sergeant-major gave their opinion as to the appellant’s ability or
fitness to drive, the court was wrong in admitting that evidence.

In R. v. Neil, [1962] Crim. L.R. 698 a Courts-Martial
 Appeal Court (Winn, Widgery and Brabin JJ.) indicated that the scope of Davies
“might call for consideration in future in relation to particular
circumstances”. The Court in Neil upheld the conviction on the somewhat
tenuous ground that the members of the Court Martial “were not invited or
directed by the Judge‑Advocate to pay attention to opinion as distinct
from observation”.

Eire

An informative discussion of the point under review comes from Eire,
A.G. (Ruddy) v. Kenny (1959), 94 I.T.L.R. 185. Kenny was charged with
driving a motor lorry while drunk. The prosecution proposed to ask a police
witness whether “in his opinion the defendant was drunk and incapable of
driving the vehicle”. The solicitor for the defend-

[Page 830]

ant objected to the question and submitted that the witness “not
being a doctor or like expert was not qualified or competent to give evidence
of his opinion of the defendant’s condition”. The prosecution replied that
evidence as to drunkenness or sobriety need not necessarily be that of a
medical practitioner or similar witness but that any ordinary witness would be
qualified to give evidence on such matters. The District Justice thereupon
agreed to state a case for the opinion of the High Court. The question for
decision was whether evidence by a member of the Garda Siochana was admissible
of his opinion that the defendant driver by reason of his being drunk, was
unfit to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle? It was held by Davitt P. and
on appeal by the Supreme Court of Eire (Lavery and O’Daly JJ., Kingsmill Moore
J., dissenting) that the question asked should be answered “Yes”. The evidence
was admissible.

Northern Ireland

The same point arose in Northern Ireland in Sherrard v. Jacob,
[1965] N.I.L.R. 151 on a stated case. The Court of Appeal held that opinion
evidence of the police officers as to drunkenness was admissible but (Lord
MacDermott L.C.J., dissenting) opinion evidence of the police officers as to
capability to drive was not admissible. The majority of the Court followed R.
v. Davies.

Australia

The Australian case of Burrows v. Hanlin, [1930] S.A.S.R.
54 held that mere opinion as to whether a man is drunk or whether he is capable
of driving a motorcar, unsupported by facts, is not entitled to any weight.
Murray C.J. said (at p. 55):

Evidence of opinion can be given by experts on questions of
science, but as to whether a man is drunk or whether he is capable of
exercising effective control over a motorcar, mere opinion, unsupported by
facts (I think I may go so far as to say), is not admissible evidence.

[Page 831]

The later case of R. v. Spooner, [1957] V.R. 540 expressed
a less strict view, with which I find myself much in accord. Sholl J. said (at
p. 541):

I think I ought to say that my own view would be that it is
not only a police officer who may be capable of expressing an opinion whether a
man is so intoxicated as to be unable properly to drive a car. Many other
persons have had experience in driving a motor-car, and have observed persons
under the influencé of intoxicating liquor, and must, one would suppose, be in
a position to form a view as to the capacity to drive. I see no magic myself in
the fact that the witness is a police officer, or anything else. It depends
largely, I suppose, on his actual knowledge of what is required in driving a
motor car.

In R. v. Kelly, [1958] V.R. 412, Smith J. expressed the
opinion that if the Crown is merely seeking from a witness a compendious
description of what he actually observed, evidence in such form is not properly
to be regarded as opinion evidence and the law of evidence does not forbid the
giving of evidence in such form. Moreover, the law of evidence does not require
that a witness should be qualified as an expert before he testifies.

New Zealand

In Blackie v. Police, [1966] N.Z.L.R. 910 the New Zealand
Court of Appeal divided on whether an experienced traffic officer could give
evidence as to whether a driver was so far intoxicated as to be incapable of
having control of a vehicle. A majority of the Court held that a traffic
officer or policeman who can show that he is sufficiently qualified by training
or experience may be allowed to express his opinion in evidence as to a
person’s capacity to drive. The Court held also that the fact that a witness is
either a traffic officer or a policeman does not, however, automatically
qualify him to give opinion evidence on this topic.

The Text Writers

Sir Rupert Cross in his work on Evidence (5th ed., 1979,
p. 451) states that the existence of a particular issue may necessitate the
reception of evidence which is not that of an expert and yet is nothing short
of a witness’ opinion concerning an ultimate issue in the case. The author
adds, (at p. 452), that, subject to the exceptional type of situation, it would
seem that, if non‑expert opinion is in reality evidence of fact given ex
necessitate in the form of evidence of opinion, there should be no question
of its inadmissibility because it deals with ultimate issues.

Professor Cross continues (at p. 452):

This is borne out by the form of s. 3(2) of the Civil
Evidence Act 1972, which suggests that no change in the law was intended:

It is hereby declared that where a person is called as a
witness in any civil proceedings, a statement of opinion by him on a relevant
matter on which he is not qualified to give expert evidence, if made as a way
of conveying relevant facts personally perceived by him, is admissible as
evidence of what he perceived.

So far as criminal cases are concerned, the decisions on drunken
driving indicate a difference of approach between the English and Northern
Irish courts on the one hand, and the courts of Eire on the other.

Professor Cross suggests (at p. 453) two main and two subsidiary
reasons for the exclusion of non-expert opinion: In the first place it is said
that opinion evidence is irrelevant and that this is largely true of non-expert
opinion on a subject requiring expertise as well as opinion evidence concerning
matters which do not call for expertise. Secondly, it is said that the
reception of opinion evidence would “usurp the functions of the jury” in the
sense that the jury would be tempted blindly to accept a witness’ opinion. The
two subsidiary reasons mentioned are the fact that a witness who merely speaks
his opinion cannot be prosecuted for perjury, and the danger that the reception
of such evidence might indirectly evade other exclusionary rules. Cross speaks
of the first subsidiary reason as

[Page 833]

one of “some antiquity” and suggests that there is more force in
the second reason, but that “it has not been stressed by the judges”.

Professor Wigmore takes a diametrically opposed position. He
states, (vol. 7, para. 1917, Chadbourn ed., 1978) that the disparagement of
“opinion” always had reference to the testimony of a person who had no “facts”
of his own observation to speak from, and the skilled witness was the person
who had to be received by way of exception to that notion. Thus, when an
ordinary or lay witness took the stand, equipped with a personal acquaintance
with the affair and therefore competent in his sources of knowledge, the
circumstances that incidentally he drew inferences from his observed data and
expressed conclusions from them did not present itself as in any way improper.
It would not occur to any judge that this witness was doing a wrong thing.

Wigmore refers to the theory that wherever inferences and
conclusions can be drawn by the jury as well as by the witness, the witness is
superfluous, the theory being that of the exclusion of supererogatory evidence.

Wigmore uses strong language in discussing the “usurp the
functions of the jury” theory (para. 1920). The phrase, he says, is made
to imply a moral impropriety or a radical unfairness in the witness’ expression
of opinion. He says that “In this aspect the phrase is so misleading, as well
as so unsound, that it should be entirely repudiated. It is a mere bit of empty
rhetoric”. The author continues “There is no such reason for the rule, because
the witness, in expressing his opinion, is not attempting to ‘usurp’ the jury’s
function; nor could if he desired”.

Turning then to an attack of the other theory, which would deny
opinions of the “very issue before the jury” Wigmore has this to say:

The fallacy of this doctrine is, of course, that, measured
by the principle, it is both too narrow and too

[Page 834]

broad. It is too broad, because, even when the very point in
issue is to be spoken to, the jury should have help if it is needed. It is too
narrow, because opinion may be inadmissible even when it deals with something
other that the point in issue. Furthermore, the rule if carried out strictly
and invariably would exclude the most necessary testimony. When all is said, it
remains simply one of those impracticable and misconceived utterances which
lack any justification in principle [para. 1921].

Law Reform Commission Reports

The Law Reform Commission of Canada has proposed an opinion rule
based on facts perceived by the witness and on “helpfulness”:

Section 67. A witness other than one testifying as an
expert may not give an opinion or draw an inference unless it is based on facts
perceived by him and is helpful to the witness in giving a clear statement or
to the trier of fact in determining an issue [Report on Evidence (1975),
Evidence Code, s. 67].

The Ontario Law Reform Commission proposed the enactment of the
following section (Draft Act, Section 14):

Where a witness in a proceeding is testifying in a capacity
other than as a person qualified to give opinion evidence and a question is put
to him to elicit a fact that he personally perceived, his answer is admissible
as evidence of the fact even though given in the form of an expression of his
opinion upon a matter in issue in the proceeding [Report on the Law of
Evidence (1976), pp. 150-53].

A majority of the Federal/Provincial Task Force on Uniform Rules
of Evidence favoured the adoption of the proposal of the Law Reform Commission
of Canada, embodied in s. 67 of the Commission’s Evidence Code, rather than
that of the Ontario Law Reform Commission. The majority opposed the proposal of
the Ontario Law Reform Commission as being an enactment of the “collective
facts rule” which allows non-expert opinion to be admitted on the basis that it
is “a compendious mode of ascertaining the result of the actual observation of
the witness”. The majority felt that such

[Page 835]

an approach purported to draw an impossible and illogical
distinction between “fact” and “opinion”. The Task Force observed:

Section 67 would allow a lay witness to testify in the
form of opinion if it is relevant, within the realm of common experience and a
shorthand expression of the witness’s personal observation.

VII

Conclusion

I have attempted in the foregoing to highlight the opposing
points of view as reflected in some of the cases, texts, and reports of the law
reform commissions.

We start with the reality that the law of evidence is burdened
with a large number of cumbersome rules, with exclusions, and exceptions to the
exclusions, and exceptions to the exceptions. The subjects upon which the
non-expert witness is allowed to give opinion evidence is a lengthy one. The
list mentioned in Sherrard v. Jacob, supra, is by no means exhaustive:
(i) the identification of handwriting, persons and things; (ii) apparent age;
(iii) the bodily plight or condition of a person, including death and illness;
(iv) the emotional state of a person—e.g. whether distressed, angry,
aggressive, affectionate or depressed; (v) the condition of things—e.g. worn,
shabby, used or new; (vi) certain questions of value; and (vii) estimates of
speed and distance.

Except for the sake of convenience there is little, if any,
virtue, in any distinction resting on the tenuous, and frequently false,
antithesis between fact and opinion. The line between “fact” and “opinion” is
not clear.

To resolve the question before the Court, I would like to return
to broad principles. Admissibility is determined, first, by asking whether the
evidence sought to be admitted is relevant. This is a matter of applying logic
and experience to the circumstances of the particular case. The question which
must then be asked is whether, though

[Page 836]

probative, the evidence must be excluded by a clear ground of
policy or of law.

There is a direct and logical relevance between (i) the evidence
offered here, namely, the opinion of a police officer (based on perceived facts
as to the manner of driving, and indicia of intoxication of the driver)
that the person’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol, and (ii) the
ultimate probandum in the case. The probative value of the evidence is
not outweighed by such policy considerations as danger of confusing the issues
or misleading the jury. It does not unfairly surprise a party who had not had
reasonable ground to anticipate that such evidence will be offered, and the
adducing of the evidence does not necessitate undue consumption of time. As for
other considerations such as “usurping the functions of the jury” and, to the
extent that it may be regarded as a separate consideration, “opinion on the
very issue before the jury”, Wigmore has gone a long way toward establishing
that rejection of opinion evidence on either of these grounds is unsound
historically and in principle. If the court is being told that which it is in
itself entirely equipped to determine without the aid of the witness on the
point then of course the evidence is supererogatory and unnecessary. It would
be a waste of time listening to superfluous testimony.

The judge in the instant case was not in as good a position as
the police officers or Mr. Wilson to determine the degree of
Mr. Graat’s impairment or his ability to drive a motor vehicle. The
witnesses had an opportunity for personal observation. They were in a position
to give the Court real help. They were not settling the dispute. They were not
deciding the matter the Court had to decide, the ultimate issue. The judge
could accept all or part or none of their evidence. In the end he accepted the
evidence of two of the police officers and paid little heed to the evidence of the
third officer or of Mr. Wilson.

I agree with Professor Cross (at p. 443) that “The exclusion of
opinion evidence on the ultimate

[Page 837]

issue can easily become something of a fetish”. I can see no
reason in principle or in common sense why a lay witness should not be
permitted to testify in the form of an opinion if, by doing so, he is able more
accurately to express the facts he perceived.

I accept the following passage from Cross as a good statement of
the law as to the cases in which non-expert opinion is admissible.

When, in the words of an American judge, “the facts from
which a witness received an impression were too evanescent in their nature to
be recollected, or too complicated to be separately and distinctly narrated”, a
witness may state his opinion or impression. He was better equipped than the
jury to form it, and it is impossible for him to convey an adequate idea of the
premises on which he acted to the jury:

“Unless opinions, estimates and inferences which men in
their daily lives reach without conscious ratiocination as a result of what
they have perceived with their physical senses were treated in the law of
evidence as if they were mere statements of fact, witnesses would find
themselves unable to communicate to the judge an accurate impression of the
events they were seeking to describe.”

There is nothing in the nature of a closed list of cases in
which non-expert opinion evidence is admissible. Typical instances are provided
by questions concerning age, speed, weather, handwriting and identity in
general [at p. 448].

Before this Court counsel for the appellant took the position
that although opinion evidence by non-experts may be admissible where it is
“necessary” the opinions of the police officers in this case were superfluous,
irrelevant and inadmissible. I disagree. It is well established that a
non-expert witness may give evidence that someone was intoxicated, just as he
may give evidence of age, speed, identity or emotional state. This is because
it may be difficult for the witness to narrate his factual observations
individually. Drinking alcohol to the extent that one’s ability to drive is
impaired is a degree of intoxication, and it is yet more difficult for a
witness to narrate separately the individual facts that justify the inference,
in either the witness or the trier of fact, that someone was intoxicated to
some particular extent. If a witness is to

[Page 838]

be allowed to sum up concisely his observations by saying that
someone was intoxicated, it is all the more necessary that he be permitted to
aid the court further by saying that someone was intoxicated to a particular
degree. I agree with the comment of Lord MacDermott L.C.J. in his dissent in Sherrard
v. Jacob, supra:

I can find no good reason for allowing the non-expert to
give his opinion of the driver’s observable condition and then denying him the
right to state an opinion on the consequences of that observed condition so far
as driving is concerned [at p. 162].

Nor is this a case for the exclusion of non-expert testimony
because the matter calls for a specialist. It has long been accepted in our law
that intoxication is not such an exceptional condition as would require a
medical expert to diagnose it. An ordinary witness may give evidence of his
opinion as to whether a person is drunk. This is not a matter where scientific,
technical, or specialized testimony is necessary in order that the tribunal
properly understands the relevant facts. Intoxication and impairment of driving
ability are matters which the modern jury can intelligently resolve on the
basis of common ordinary knowledge and experience. The guidance of an expert is
unnecessary.

If that be so it seems illogical to deny the court the help it
could get from a witness’ opinion as to the degree of intoxication, that is to
say whether the person’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol. If
non-expert evidence is excluded the defence may be seriously hampered. If an
accused is to be denied the right to call persons who were in his company at
the time to testify that in their opinion his ability to drive was by no means
impaired, the cause of justice would suffer.

Whether or not the evidence given by police or other non-expert
witnesses is accepted is another matter. The weight of the evidence is entirely
a matter for the judge or judge and jury. The value of opinion will depend on
the view the court takes in all the circumstances.

[Page 839]

I would adopt the following passage from the reasons of Lord
MacDermott in Sherrard v. Jacob, supra:

The next stage is to enquire if the opinion of the same
witnesses was also admissible on the question whether the respondent, if he was
under the influence of drink, was so to an extent which made him incapable of
having proper control of the car he was driving. On this it seems to me that
the reasoning which has led me to the conclusion just stated applies as well to
this branch of the matter. The driving of motor vehicles is now so much a
matter of everyday experience for ordinary people that I find it difficult to
see how inferential or opinion evidence as to being (a) under the influence of
drink and (b) thereby unfit to drive a car can be placed in different
categories for the purpose of determining admissibility. The one as much as the
other seems to be within the capacity of the non-expert to form a reasonable
conclusion [at p. 162].

A non-expert witness cannot, of course, give opinion evidence on
a legal issue as, for example, whether or not a person was negligent. That is
because such an opinion would not qualify as an abbreviated version of the
witnesses factual observations. An opinion that someone was negligent is partly
factual, but it also involves the application of legal standards. On the other
hand, whether a person’s ability to drive is impaired by alcohol is a question
of fact, not of law. It does not involve the application of any legal standard.
It is akin to an opinion that someone is too drunk to climb a ladder or to go
swimming, and the fact that a witness’ opinion, as here, may be expressed in
the exact words of the Criminal Code  does not change a factual matter
into a question of law. It only reflects the fact that the draftsmen of the Code
employed the ordinary English phrase: “his ability to drive…is impaired by
alcohol” (s. 234 ).

In short, I know of no clear ground of policy or of law which
would require the exclusion of opinion evidence tendered by the Crown or the
defence as to Mr. Graat’s impairment.

I conclude with two caveats. First, in every case, in determining
whether an opinion is admissible,

[Page 840]

the trial judge must necessarily excercise a large measure of
discretion. Second, there may be a tendency for judges and juries to let the
opinion of police witnesses overwhelm the opinion evidence of other witnesses.
Since the opinion is admitted under the “compendious statement of facts”
exception, rather than under the “expert witness” exception, there is no
special reason for preferring the police evidence over the “opinion” of other
witnesses. As always, the trier of fact must decide in each case what weight to
give what evidence. The “opinion” of the police officer is entitled to no
special regard. Ordinary people with ordinary experience are able to know as a
matter of fact that someone is too drunk to perform certain tasks, such as
driving a car. If the witness lacks the relevant experience, or is otherwise
limited in his testimonial capacity, or if the witness is not sure whether the
person was intoxicated to the point of impairment, that can be brought out in
cross-examination. But the fact that a police witness has seen more impaired
drivers than a non-police witness is not a reason in itself to prefer the
evidence of the police officer. Constable McMullen and Sergeant Spoelstra were
not testifying as experts based on their extensive experience as police
officers.

There was some confusion about this matter in this case as
appears from the following cross‑examination of Mr. Wilson:

Q. …And of course you’ve not and never have been a Police
Officer. Do you agree or disagree with me?

A. No. No.

Q. You have never been a Police Officer?

A. No.

Q. And you’re not in the habit of checking people as to the
amount of alcohol that is consumed in order to make him impaired. Do you agree
or disagree with me?

A. I have to agree with you.

Q. Yes. So you’re really not in a position to tell us
whether or not he was impaired or not impaired by alcohol. Do you agree or
disagree with me?

A. I was only…

[Page 841]

…

Q. …But of course you were in no position to judge as to
whether or not he was impaired. Do you agree or disagree with me?

A. I don’t have any qualifications in that regard I guess.

Mr. Wilson does not need any special qualifications. Nor
were the police officers relying on any special qualifications when they gave
their opinions. Both police and non-police witnesses are merely giving a
compendious statement of facts that are too subtle and too complicated to be
narrated separately and distinctly. Trial judges should bear in mind that this
is non-expert opinion evidence, and that the opinion of police officers is not
entitled to preference just because they may have extensive experience with
impaired drivers. The credit and accuracy of the police must be viewed in the
same manner as that of other witnesses and in the light of all the evidence in
the case. If the police and traffic officers have been closely associated with
the prosecution, such association may affect the weight to be given to such
evidence.

The trial judge was correct in admitting the opinions of the
three police officers and Mr. Wilson.

For the foregoing reasons, as well as for the reasons given by
Chief Justice Howland, I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Election of trial by judge and
jury—Whether accused may elect the forum in which to be tried as well as the
mode of trial—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34, as amended by 1974-75-76, c.
93, ss. 429.1, 464, 482, 484, 492(3), 497(d), 507.

The appellant, the accused, was before a
magistrate under Part XVI of the Criminal Code  on a charge of an
indictable offence which was not within the absolute jurisdiction of the
magistrate nor within the exclusive jurisdiction of a superior court of
criminal jurisdiction. He elected trial by a court composed of a judge and jury
and requested that the judge be a Supreme Court judge. The magistrate refused
to accept the accused’s election.

When an offence is not within the sole
jurisdiction of a court composed of a judge and jury, jury trials in Ontario can be presided over by a Supreme
Court judge or by a county court judge.

Thereupon the accused brought an application
by way of certiorari and mandamus which was dismissed by the Ontario
High Court. The Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed the appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The success of this appeal rested on finding
a necessary implication from ss. 482 and 484 to support election of the forum
as well as the mode of trial. The appellant contrasted other provisions of the Code,
such as ss. 464, 429.1, 492(3), 497(d) and 507, but no such
implication as would support the appellant’s position could be made under the relevant
provisions governing and surrounding election for trial.

The choice of forum is left open to the
prosecution after an election by an accused pursuant to s. 484 of the Code.

R. v. Jory (1978),
46 C.C.C. (2d) 44, referred to.

[Page 249]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing an
appeal by the appellant from the dismissal by the Ontario High Court of an
application by way of certiorari and mandamus. Appeal dismissed.

Julius Melnitzer, for the appellant.

David H. Doherty, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The issue in this appeal is
whether an accused, who is before a magistrate under Part XVI of the Criminal
Code  on a charge of an indictable offence which is not within the absolute
jurisdiction of the magistrate nor within the exclusive jurisdiction of a
superior court of criminal jurisdiction, may, when put to his election under Criminal
Code , s. 484(2) , elect the forum in which he is to be tried as well as
the mode of trial. In short, in electing trial by a court composed of a judge
and jury, is he entitled to claim trial before a court composed of a Supreme
Court judge and jury? Correlatively, should he elect trial by judge alone, is
he entitled to specify trial by a Supreme Court judge alone?

This issue arose in Ontario where, prior to an
amendment by 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93, s. 61, of the definition of “judge” in
s. 482 of Part XVI, the term related in Ontario only to a judge or junior judge
of the county or district court. As a result of the amendment, the definition
of judge was extended to include a judge of the superior court of criminal
jurisdiction in the province. Counsel for the appellant does not rely on this
change as being decisive in his favour and, indeed, he could hardly do so
because the definition of “judge” in the Province of British Columbia had, even
before the amendment affecting Ontario, included the Chief Justice or a puisne
judge of the Supreme Court and, similarly in Manitoba, had included the Chief
Justice or a puisne judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench, as well as a judge of
a county court in each of those Provinces.

[Page 250]

In some provinces, the question of choice not
only of the mode of trial but of the forum is now predetermined by the merger
of county and superior courts, as has happened in Prince Edward Island, in New
Brunswick and in Alberta, where “judge” under s. 482 (as amended by 1978-79
(Can.), c. 11, s. 10(1)) now means a judge of the superior court of criminal
jurisdiction in those Provinces. On the other hand, for Nova Scotia “judge” is
defined as a judge of a county court, so that there too the mode of trial, by
judge alone or a court composed of judge and jury, also determines the forum
when an election is made under s. 484 and the accused chooses not to be
tried by the magistrate. In short, the definition of “judge” determines the
court level at which the Crown can proceed.

In the present case the magistrate refused to
accept the accused’s election for trial by a court composed of Supreme Court
judge and jury and directed that the election be entered in conformity with the
words of s. 484(2)  which reads as follows:

484. (1)…

(2) An accused to whom this section applies
shall, after the information has been read to him, be put to his election in
the following words:

You have the option to elect to be tried by
a magistrate without a jury; or you may elect to be tried by a judge without a
jury; or you may elect to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. How
do you elect to be tried?

Thereupon the accused brought an application by
way of certiorari and mandamus which came before Trainor J. of the
Ontario High Court who dismissed it. His judgment save for a qualification
irrelevant to the issue in this case was affirmed by the Ontario Court of
Appeal.

I am in substantial agreement with the reasons
of Trainor J., save that (and this was a point made by the Crown respondent) it
is not quite correct to say that the effect of the amendment of the definition
of “judge” in Ontario was to
allow the accused to re-elect without going through the pre-

[Page 251]

vious procedure of appearing before a county or
district court judge. Rather, it was to enable a Supreme Court judge in Ontario to try indictable offences without
a jury.

Counsel for the appellant had to make his case
by finding a necessary implication from ss. 482 and 484. He emphasized the
use of the indefinite article “a” in s. 484 and contrasted other provisions of
the Criminal Code , such as ss. 464 , 429.1  and 492(3) . He also relied on
the words of s. 484(3) (a), requiring a magistrate who commits an accused
for trial to endorse on the information “a statement showing the nature of the
election”. In my opinion, no such implication as would support the appellant’s
position flows from the differences in the wording of s. 482(2)  and (3) .

Section 464 which is in Part XV of the Criminal
Code  and which provides for an election in the same terms as s. 484(2) 
where an accused is before a justice other than a magistrate does not help the
contention of the appellant albeit there is no definition of “judge” in Part
XV. The absence of a definition cannot enlarge the position of an accused vis-à-vis
the Crown, nor can it gloss the words of s. 484(2)  to give the accused the
right to choose the forum. Nor is the contrast of s. 429.1  helpful to his
position. It is an express illustration of a limited situation where the forum
is prescribed. Under s. 429.1, an accused, on electing trial by a court
composed of judge and jury, is to be tried by a court composed of a superior
court judge and jury unless at the time of election he agrees to trial before a
county or district court judge and jury or re-elects under s. 492  for trial
before a juge alone, or, with the assent of the Attorney General, for trial by
a magistrate. Even so s. 429.1  is qualified by reference to the powers of the
Attorney General under s. 498  (i.e. in this context, to require trial by
a court composed of a county or district court judge and jury).

[Page 252]

I do not question the concern of counsel for the
accused that to deny his contention may leave too much power in the
prosecution. However, the Crown has traditionally had the choice which counsel
for the appellant now seeks to deny, and there is little point in trying to
assess where the greater opportunities for abuse lie, whether with the Crown or
with the accused. Certainly, where there are co-accused, each may choose a
different forum, but counsel for the appellant answers this by pointing to
overriding powers of the Attorney General. Be that as it may, the success of
this appeal must rest on finding a necessary implication to support election of
the forum as well as the mode of trial and I am unable to see how such an
implication can be made under the relevant provisions governing and surrounding
election for trial.

I have two other observations. It is true that
s. 507  of the Criminal Code  respecting the preferring of indictments in
Ontario and in other specified provinces does not carry any definition of
“judge” or “court”, there being no definition section in Part XVII. This,
however, does not help the appellant; if anything, it fortifies the choice of
forum that is left open to the prosecution in respect of an accused who has
been put to his election after committal for trial, pursuant to s. 484 .

The second observation concerns the judgment in R.
v. Jory[1] a
judgment of His Honour Judge Graburn, upon which counsel for the appellant
heavily relied. It was a case where the accused had elected trial by a court
composed of judge and jury and the Crown chose to proceed on the charges in the
Supreme Court of Ontario. There were also co-accused involved. When the accused
opted for re-election under s. 492 for trial before a judge alone, an issue
arose whether, having regard to the counts under which the accused was charged,
the re-election could take place before Judge Graburn or had to be made in the
Supreme Court where the indictment had been sent. The fact that Judge Graburn
concluded that he could take the re-elec-

[Page 253]

tion does not, in my view, mean that the accused
could choose the forum. The re-election provisions are special provisions and
do not colour the terms of s. 484.

It is true that Judge Graburn said he would
invoke s. 497(d) if the accused should re-elect trial by judge alone in
the County Court Judges’ Criminal Court and that he would then require him to
be tried with his co-accused in the Supreme Court with a jury. I do not,
however, regard these observations as considered conclusions that would lend
support to the appellant’s contention. They are perhaps a reflection of the
course of practice in such situations. The main question for Judge Graburn was
whether the accused could re-elect before him. His observations about
re-election for trial by judge alone in the County Court Judges’ Criminal Court
are not supported by s. 492(3) nor does his invocation of s. 497(d)
allow him to specify trial in the Supreme Court with a jury. Section 492(3)
speaks only of re-election for trial before a judge alone without specification
of forum and s. 497(d) speaks of discretion to require a trial by a
court composed of a judge and jury, again without specification of the forum.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
NEWFOUNDLAND

Criminal law—R.C.M.P. officer acting as
“prosecutor”—Indictable offence—New trial or acquittal—Criminal Code , ss. 2 ,
236(1) , 426 , 427 , 482 , 483 , 484(2) , 487 , 720 , 721 , 722 , 747 .

The appellant was charged with “breaking and
entering” contrary to the provisions of s. 306(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code . The prosecutor who conducted the trial was a member of the R.C.M.P.
At the close of the Crown’s case, defence counsel put forward a motion for
dismissal on the basis that the Crown was not properly represented. The motion
was eventually dismissed. The accused called no evidence and was found guilty.
The Court of Appeal by a majority dismissed his appeal.

Held (Ritchie
J. dissenting): The appeal is allowed.

Per Laskin C.J.
and Martland, Estey and McIntyre JJ.: It was agreed that the police officer
conducting the proceedings did not come within the definition of “prosecutor”
in s. 2 of the Code. However, as, by reason of the inclusion in the
definition in s. 720 of the word “agents” he did qualify under that
section, the question to be decided is whether or not that definition, in Part
XXIV of the Code, can be applied to the police officer who conducted the
prosecution of this case.

The appellant being charged with an indictable
offence, the procedure applicable to his trial was that provided in Part XVI of
the Code. The fact the accused elected for trial by magistrate under
s. 484(2)  did not remove the proceedings from Part XVI. The fact that
s. 487  directs the magistrate “acting under this part” to take evidence in
accordance with Part XV cannot convert the proceedings into summary conviction
proceedings and thereby change the nature of the offence, nor can it convert
the magistrate into a summary conviction court under Part XXIV with a lesser
jurisdiction than he is specifically given in Part XVI.

[Page 234]

The appellant seeks to have his conviction
set aside and an acquittal entered. The ends of justice will be met here by
directing a new trial, as there was no loss of jurisdiction on the part of the
trial judge, as the accused suffered no prejudice and as he refrained from
advancing his jurisdictional defence until after the Crown had closed its case.

Per Ritchie
J., dissenting: The pre-Confederation practice in the magistrate’s
courts of Newfoundland in
summary trial of indictable offences was that police officers could act as
prosecutors. This practice was so universally accepted as to be recognized as
part of the law of Newfoundland and the terms of Union between Newfoundland and
Canada provided for the continuation of laws in force at the time of Union.
However, the Criminal Code  of Canada came into force in Newfoundland in 1950 and introduced new definitions.

The applicable definition of prosecutor as
found in the Code depends not upon the nature of the charge but on the
nature of the proceedings and it follows that although the charge involves the
commission of an indictable offence, the fact that the evidence was presented
as part of the proceedings in a summary conviction court carries with it the
meaning of prosecutor as defined in Part XXIV of the Code. In any event
the appellant suffered no prejudice as a result of the procedure which was
adopted.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of Newfoundland[1], dismissing an
appeal by the accused from conviction. Appeal allowed, new trial ordered,

the appellant.

the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Martland, Estey
and McIntyre JJ. was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—I have read the reasons for judgment
prepared by my brother Ritchie, but with deference I find myself unable to
agree with

[Page 235]

his disposition of the matter. I am of the
opinion that the Provincial Court judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal
were incorrect in deciding in this matter that no error had been made by
permitting the prosecution of an offence under s. 306(1) (b) of
the Criminal Code  by a police officer, not the informant and not a
member of the bar of the Province of Newfoundland. My brother Ritchie has set
out the relevant facts in the case and has described the historical background
of the practice in the Province
of Newfoundland in this respect. Accordingly, I need not deal further with
these matters.

The Criminal Code  provides two
definitions of the term “prosecutor”. In section 2 “prosecutor” is defined
for application “In this Act” in these terms:

“prosecutor” means the Attorney General or,
where the Attorney General does not intervene, means the person who institutes
proceedings to which this Act applies, and includes counsel acting on behalf of
either of them;

In section 720 of Part XXIV of the Code for
application “In this Part” the term is defined as:

“prosecutor” means an informant or the
Attorney General or their respective counsel or agents;

Section 2 defines as well “counsel” in these
terms:

“counsel” means a barrister or solicitor,
in respect of the matters or things that barristers and solicitors,
respectively, are authorized by the law of the province to do or perform in
relation to legal proceedings;

It was agreed that the police officer conducting
the proceedings in the case at bar did not come within the definition of
s. 2 of the Code. By reason of the inclusion in the definition in
s. 720 of the word “agents” he did qualify under that section. The
question to be decided then is whether or not the definition in Part XXIV of
the Code can be applied to the police officer who conducted the
prosecution of this case.

There is little direct authority on this point
but, in my opinion, an examination of the relevant procedural provisions of the
Criminal Code  leads

[Page 236]

to the conclusion that I have adopted. To begin
with, the Criminal Code  divides all crimes into two broad
classifications, indictable offences and offences punishable on summary
conviction. Some crimes may be either indictable or summary, e.g., offences
under s. 236(1)  of the Criminal Code . In such cases, the decision
as to the method of trial lies in the discretion of the Crown, which may elect
to proceed by indictment or by summary conviction: see R. v. West[2]. It must be borne in mind that this
categorization of offences is made in the Criminal Code  and where so
categorized in the Code—or designated by the Crown in its choice of
procedure in the case of offences which may be either indictable or triable on
summary conviction—such characterization does not change by virtue of the
election of mode of trial made by an accused.

Section 2  of the Criminal Code  defines
two courts for the trial of criminal offences: a “superior court of criminal
jurisdiction” and a “court of criminal jurisdiction”. The superior court of
criminal jurisdiction in the Province of Newfoundland is the Supreme Court of
Newfoundland, and a “court of criminal jurisdiction” is defined in these terms:

(a) a court of general or
quarter sessions of the peace, when presided over by a superior court judge or
a county or district court judge, or in the cities of Montreal and Quebec, by a
municipal judge of the city, as the case may be, or a judge of the sessions of
the peace, and

(b) a magistrate or judge
acting under Part XVI.

Jurisdiction in respect of indictable offences
is given to the superior courts of criminal jurisdiction and courts of criminal
jurisdiction, pursuant to s. 426  and s. 427  of the Criminal Code .

The appellant was charged with an indictable
offence. Therefore the procedure applicable to his trial was that provided for
in Part XVI of the Criminal Code . The offence is not one mentioned

[Page 237]

in s. 427  and is not one over which a
magistrate has exclusive jurisdiction under s. 483 . Accordingly, he was
put to his election under s. 484(2) of the Code and could choose
trial by magistrate without a jury; trial by judge without a jury; or a trial
by a court composed of judge and jury. He chose the first form of trial, i.e.
magistrate without a jury, and thus placed himself before a magistrate
defined in Part XVI of the Code in these terms in s. 482 :

“magistrate” means

(a) a person appointed under
the law of a province, by whatever title he may be designated, who is specially
authorized by the terms of his appointment to exercise the jurisdiction
conferred upon a magistrate by this Part, but does not include two or more
justices of the peace sitting together,

(b) with respect to the Yukon
Territory, a judge of the Supreme Court or a magistrate or deputy magistrate
appointed under an Ordinance of the Territory, and

(c) with respect to the
Northwest Territories, a judge of the Supreme Court or a magistrate or deputy
magistrate appointed under an Ordinance of the Territories.

It is evident from the foregoing that the Criminal
Code  has vested in magistrates authorized to act under Part XVI of the Code
jurisdiction to try indictable offences in addition to those over which a
magistrate has absolute jurisdiction when an accused so elects under the
provisions of s. 484(2) . It is clear as well that the magistrate so acting
is acting under Part XVI of the Code and the offence remains an
indictable offence, notwithstanding election of a more summary form of trial.

Offences triable on summary conviction fall
within Part XXIV of the Code. “Proceedings” under Part XXIV find their
definition is s. 720  in these terms:

“proceedings” means

(a) proceedings in respect of
offences that are declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada or an
enactment made thereunder to be punishable on summary conviction, and

[Page 238]

(b) proceedings where a
justice is authorized by an Act of the Parliament of Canada or an enactment
made thereunder to make an order;

Part XXIV of the Code sets up a court for
the trial of these matters called a Summary Conviction Court. It is defined in
s. 720 , as follows:

“summary conviction court” means a person
who has jurisdiction in the territorial division where the subject-matter of
the proceedings is alleged to have arisen and who

(a) is given jurisdiction
over the proceedings by the enactment under which the proceedings are taken,

(b) is a justice or
magistrate, where the enactment under which the proceedings are taken does not
expressly give jurisdiction to any person or class of persons, or

(c) is a magistrate, where
the enactment under which the proceedings are taken gives jurisdiction in
respect thereof to two or more justices;

This is a court having a different and a much
more limited jurisdiction than that of the superior court of criminal
jurisdiction, or the court of criminal jurisdiction referred to in s. 2 of
the Code in which indictable offences are tried. It was created to deal
with lesser offences than those dealt with under Part XVI and the powers it
exercises are limited by the provisions of Part XXIV. For example, s. 721 
provides for a six-month limitation in the commencement of proceedings;
s. 722  imposes a restriction on the powers of punishment, and to further
illustrate the difference in proceedings under Part XXIV, different appeal
procedures are provided in s. 747  et seq. from those pertaining to
indictable offences tried under Part XVI.

I have been at some pains to illustrate the
difference between proceedings under Part XVI, and those under Part XXIV,
because the judgment of Morgan J.A., one of the majority in the Court of
Appeal, seems to be predicated upon the assumption that the election for trial
by magistrate under s. 484(2)  removed the proceedings from Part XVI and
placed them in a summary conviction court under Part XXIV. He said:

[Page 239]

Once an accused elects to be tried by a
Magistrate under the provisions of Sec. 484, the Magistrate obtains
jurisdiction to hear the matter. The accused is then tried in a “summary
jurisdiction court” and the evidence taken in the same manner as if he were charged
with an offence punishable on summary conviction. Though he is liable to a
greater punishment if convicted.

He therefore considered that the definition of
“prosecutor” in Part XXIV would apply and permit the police officer to
prosecute. He found support for this view in the fact that s. 487  directs
the Part XVI magistrate, conducting a trial of an indictable offence after
election, to take evidence in accordance with Part XV, a similar direction to
that given a magistrate acting under Part XXIV.

I am unable to agree with those conclusions.
Jurisdiction to try indictable offences is specifically given to the superior
courts of criminal jurisdiction and the courts of criminal jurisdiction. The
magistrate mentioned in Part XVI is a different court from that mentioned in
Part XXIV. The fact that s. 487  directs the magistrate “acting under this
part” to take evidence in accordance with Part XV cannot convert the
proceedings into summary conviction proceedings and thereby change the nature
of the offence, nor can it convert the magistrate into a summary conviction
court under Part XXIV with a lesser jurisdiction than he is specifically given
in Part XVI. For the reasons which I have tried to outline, I am of the view
that Part XVI proceedings and Part XXIV proceedings stand upon separate
footings. Indictable offences are not triable under the provisions of Part XXIV
save where the Criminal Code  provides that the offence may be either
indictable or punishable on summary conviction, and the Crown chooses to
proceed by summary conviction. The offence charged here was simply indictable.
It remains so notwithstanding the election and is not triable under Part XXIV
of the Code. It follows then that the definition of “prosecutor” from
that part of the Code can have no application in this case and, in

[Page 240]

my view, the Court of Appeal was in error in so
applying it.

The appellant seeks to have his conviction set
aside and an acquittal entered. It must be observed here that the appellant did
not raise the point under discussion at the opening of the proceedings. He was
represented by counsel and without objection the Crown put in its case. Then
the appellant’s counsel moved to dismiss the charge on the basis that the Crown
was not properly represented. When this motion was refused the appellant chose
to call no evidence and the conviction followed.

In my view, while I am of the opinion that
because of the failure of the Crown to comply with the provisions of the Code
in the conduct of these proceedings the conviction cannot stand, I do not
consider that an acquittal should be ordered. The ends of justice will be met
in this case by directing a new trial. The appellant alleges a loss of
jurisdiction on the part of the trial judge but I cannot accept such a
proposition. The information was valid on its face and not attacked. The trial
judge before whom the election was made had full jurisdiction to take the
election and when the election was made he acquired jurisdiction to hear the
trial. I cannot accept the argument that he lost jurisdiction and rendered any
determination a nullity by what amounts to a procedural error in the conduct of
the case. The appellant has suffered no prejudice here. He has not been
compelled to disclose any defence he may wish to advance. I am averse to
offering encouragement to those who, intending to assert what they consider a
jurisdictional defence, refrain from advancing it until after the Crown has
closed its case and lost any opportunity to correct its proceedings.

I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside
the conviction, and direct a new trial before a magistrate under Part XVI of
the Code, pursuant to the election made by the appellant.

[Page 241]

The following are the reasons delivered by

RITCHIE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland dismissing an appeal
from a judgment rendered at trial by Magistrate Wicks whereby the appellant was
convicted of “breaking and entering” contrary to the provisions of
s. 306(1) (b) of the Criminal Code .

The appeal comes to this Court pursuant to the
provisions of s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  by reason of
the fact that Mr. Justice Gushue delivered himself of lengthy dissenting
reasons for judgment wherein he found that the learned magistrate presiding at
trial erred in allowing a police officer to act as prosecutor and that the
proceedings before him were accordingly vitiated, with the result that the
appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.

The proceedings before the learned magistrate,
except for his reasons for judgment, have not been reproduced in the case on
appeal before this Court and we are accordingly of necessity restricted to the
material contained in the “Statement of Fact” agreed to between the parties.
The information which was laid by Constable Anderson of the R.C.M.P. is dated
May 11, 1977 and the appellant elected trial “by magistrate without a jury” on
June 21, 1977. The ensuing events are best described in the language employed
in the Statement of Fact as follows:

After several postponements with the
consent of the accused, his Counsel and the Prosecutor the matter was set for
trial. An election was made and a plea of not guilty entered. The Prosecutor
who conducted the trial was Corporal Steven McDonald, a member of the Clarenville
detachment of the R.C.M.P. At the close of the Crown’s case, Defence Counsel
put forward a motion for dismissal on the basis that the Crown was not properly
represented. The Magistrate adjourned the hearing and set a date whereby the
Prosecutor was allowed time to prepare an argument on the points involved in
the motion for dismissal.

At a later date the Crown, represented by
Mr. Hurley, from the Provincial Justice Department attended and argued the
Crown’s position. After the Crown presented its argument, the Magistrate again
postponed his decision and a date for his decision was set for October 26,
1977.

[Page 242]

On that date Mr. Hurley again appeared
and judgment against the defence motion was given by the Magistrate in a
lengthy judgment. After the motion was dismissed, the accused called no
evidence and was found guilty. Sentence was imposed.

It is from the conviction that the
appellant appeals this matter.

It should perhaps be pointed out that the record
discloses the judgment of the learned provincial court to have been delivered
on November 4, 1977 and that this is the date upon which the conviction and
sentence were imposed. The grounds of appeal from this conviction to the Court
of Appeal of Newfoundland read as follows:

1. That the Magistrate erred in law in
finding that the Law Society Act R.S.N. 1977 Section 86, sub-paragraph (i) was
intra vires the powers of the Province where it allows a member of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police to prosecute cases in the criminal code which are
indictable offences.

2. That the Magistrate erred in law in
finding the accused guilty of a breach of Section 306(1) (b) of
the Criminal Code  which was prosecuted by a member of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, who was not the informant, and who was not Counsel as defined
under the Criminal Code .

3. That the prosecution of an indictable
offence by a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police violates Section 1(b)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights R.S.C. 1970.

4. Such other grounds as the Court may
allow and which Counsel may argue.

Mr. Justice Gushue’s dissent in the Court
of Appeal was limited to the question of law raised by the second ground. As to
the first ground, the learned dissenting judge made an express finding that he
“would dismiss this ground of appeal”, and the third ground concerning the
relevance of s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights does
not appear to have been argued before the Court of Appeal and was not argued in
this Court.

Before embarking on a consideration of the
second ground, I think it should be observed that the pre-Confederation
practice in the magistrate’s courts of Newfoundland in summary trial of
indictable offences was that police officers, even if

[Page 243]

they were not the informant in the case, could
be heard to present the case for the Crown. This practice, as is pointed out by
all judges of the Court of Appeal, stemmed from the difficulties of
transportation to and from the outports of the Province and the consequent
impracticability involved in having to attach qualified lawyers as Crown
prosecutors in the various magistrate’s courts. It was thus recognized in
Newfoundland before Confederation that prosecutions in summary conviction
courts, whether they concerned summary conviction offences or indictable
offences in respect of which the accused had elected trial by a magistrate,
could legally be prosecuted by a police officer. This practice was so
universally accepted as to be recognized as part of the law of Newfoundland.

With the conclusion of the Terms of Union
between Newfoundland and Canada, provision was made for the continuation of
laws in force at the time of Union. This is made plain from the language of
Term 18(1) as set out in the Schedule to the British North America Act, 1949:

18. (1)
Subject to these Terms, all laws in force in Newfoundland at or immediately
prior to the date of Union shall continue therein as if the Union had not been
made, subject nevertheless to be repealed, abolished, or altered by the
Parliament of Canada or by the Legislature of the Province of Newfoundland
according to the authority of the Parliament or of the Legislature under the
British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946, and all orders, rules, and
regulations made under any such laws shall likewise continue, subject to be
revoked or amended by the body or person that made such orders, rules, or
regulations or the body or person that has power to make such orders, rules, or
regulations after the date of Union, according to their respective authority
under the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946.

I think it is to be accepted that the provisions
of this Term were effective to perpetuate in Newfoundland the laws in force
immediately prior to the date of Union subject however to such laws being
amended or repealed in the manner specified. Amongst the relevant pre‑Confederation
statutes is The Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1930, 1930 (Nfld.), c. 14
relating to the powers and procedures of magistrates in Newfoundland and con-

[Page 244]

taining the following section respecting
summary trials of indictable offences:

107. Where
an indictable offence is under the circumstances in this act mentioned
authorized to be dealt with summarily,—

(1) The procedure shall, until the court
assume the power to deal with such offence summarily, be the same in all respects
as if the offence were to be dealt with throughout as an indictable offence,
but when and so soon as the court assumes the power to deal with such offence
summarily, the procedure shall be the same from and after that period as if the
offence were an offence punishable on summary conviction and not on indictment,
and the provisions of this Act relating to offences punishable on summary
conviction shall apply accordingly; and…

There was no pre-Confederation statute in
Newfoundland in any way curtailing the magistrate’s right to permit a police
officer to appear as a prosecutor before him and this was the practice which
had prevailed from the earliest times.

In 1950, however, the Criminal Code  of
Canada and the Canada Evidence Act  came into force in Newfoundland as of
the date of their proclamation. The Code provides for the repeal of The
Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1930 and statutes amending it and introduces
definitions and procedural provisions for the institution of prosecutions.

The contention of the appellant that the
magistrate erred in permitting a member of the R.C.M.P. who was not an
informant to prosecute this case is based upon acceptance of the argument that
the meaning of “prosecutor” in the case of a trial when the accused is charged
with having committed an indictable offence and has elected to have his trial
take place before a magistrate, must be the meaning assigned to that word by
s. 2  of the Criminal Code  which provides:

“prosecutor” means the Attorney General or,
where the Attorney General does not intervene, means the person who institutes
proceedings to which this Act applies and includes counsel acting on behalf of
either of them.

Under the provisions of this section it
appears to me to be obvious that a prosecution for an indictable offence
conducted in a superior court of

[Page 245]

criminal jurisdiction is required to be
presented by the Attorney General or his “counsel”; other considerations
however apply to the trial of an indictable offence by a magistrate in a
summary conviction court when the accused has elected so to be tried. In such
cases the procedure to be followed by the magistrate in the taking of evidence
is that set forth in s. 736 of the Code which, under subs. (3),
provides:

(3) Where the defendant pleads not guilty
or states that he has cause to show why an order should not be made against
him, as the case may be, the summary conviction court shall proceed with the
trial, and shall take the evidence of witnesses for the prosecutor and the
defendant in accordance with the provisions of Part XV relating to preliminary
inquiries.

As the summary conviction provisions of the Code,
i.e. Part XXIV, apply to the proceedings at the trial, it appears to me
that the definition of “prosecutor” found in that Part, i.e. s. 720 
subs. (1) is the applicable definition for the purposes of this case. That
definition reads:

“prosecutor” means an informant or the
Attorney General or their respective counsel or agents;…

The word “counsel” is defined in s. 2  as
meaning a barrister or solicitor. It is therefore clear that the use of the
word “agents” in s. 720  must contemplate persons other than qualified
lawyers and in my opinion, having regard to all the circumstances, in the
present case it includes police officers.

I share the view expressed by Mr. Justice
Morgan that the applicable definition of “prosecutor” as found in the Code depends
not upon the nature of the charge but on the nature of the proceedings and it
follows that although the charge in the present case involves the commission of
an indictable offence, the fact that the evidence was presented as part of the
proceedings in a summary conviction court carries with it the meaning of
“prosecutor” as defined in the summary conviction provisions of the Criminal
Code  (Part  XXIV ).

It will be seen that I am in general agreement
with the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Morgan but I have not found
it necessary to

[Page 246]

analyze the applicable provisions of the Criminal
Code  as did the members of the Court of Appeal because even if it could be
said that there was error by the magistrate in permitting the constable to
conduct the prosecution, I am satisfied that it was not an error affecting his
jurisdiction or in any way rendering the trial wholly defective. I think this
issue is settled in the reasons for judgment of Chief Justice Furlong where he
says:

I have no doubt that if the trial was
improperly conducted it might well affect the jurisdiction of the tribunal but
this would have to be an impropriety so outrageous as to clearly condemn the
tribunal of failing to discharge its judicial functions with justice.

In this present case there has been no
attempt to strike at the jurisdiction of the tribunal either directly or
indirectly. The only complaint which the Appellant makes is that he was
prosecuted by a person who he says should not have prosecuted him, but that
otherwise the trial was properly conducted.

I can only express my view quite clearly
that even if there were the defects alleged by the Appellant it goes nowhere
near to the position where I could say that the trial was wholly defective.

In the case of R. v. Szoboszloi[3], the Crown case was presented by a
police constable and Mr. Justice Aylesworth of the Court of Appeal of
Ontario had this to say about the objection taken in that case:

…it is said, no counsel appeared and the
only representative with respect to the prosecution was a uniformed and, it is
further said, an armed police constable. That may, as the Magistrate below
observed, be the practice. It may in certain aspects thereof be objectionable.
It may, although we by no means decide that, be even not within the wide
definition of ‘agent’ as applicable to the relevant part of the Code; but
be that as it may, in our view it decidedly does not have the effect of
depriving the Magistrate of jurisdiction or of rendering the proceedings before
him a nullity.

In that case an application for leave to appeal
to this Court was dismissed.

[Page 247]

Having regard to all the above, I am of opinion
that there was no error on the part of the trial magistrate in permitting an
R.C.M.P. officer to conduct the case for the Crown and in any event the
appellant suffered no prejudice as a result of the procedure which was adopted.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Constitutional law—Power of Attorney General
of Canada to institute prosecution for conspiring to import drugs—Application
of decision in Hauser—Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C 1970, c. N-l,
s. 5(1)—Criminal Code , ss. 2 , 115(2) , 423(1) —Interpretation Act, R.S.C
1970, c. I-23, s. 27—British North America Act, ss. 91(27), 92(14).

Criminal law—Procedure—Conspiracy to import
drugs—Indictment laid by Attorney General of Canada—Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-l, s. 5(1)—Criminal Code ,
s. 423(1) .

Respondent was convicted of conspiring to
import drugs in contravention of s. 5(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, thereby
committing a breach of s. 423(1)  of the Criminal Code . The
indictment was preferred by the Attorney General and signed by his agent. The
accused appealed on the ground, inter alia, that the indictment was a
nullity because the Attorney General of Canada did not have the right to prefer
it. The Court of Appeal for Quebec allowed the appeal upon this ground. This judgment was rendered
before the judgment of this Court in R. v. Hauser, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 984,
but respondent argued that this decision was not conclusive because it held
that the Attorney General of Canada could prefer indictments for breaches of
the Narcotic Control Act, while in the case at bar the offence alleged,
that of conspiracy, is a breach of the Criminal Code .

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

[Page 189]

The right of the Attorney General of Canada
to initiate proceedings is incidental to the definition of “Attorney General”
in s. 2  of the Criminal Code . In Hauser, a majority of this
Court found that the Parliament of Canada had the power to authorize the
Attorney General of Canada to prefer indictments for a breach of the Narcotic
Control Act, and it held unanimously that the Parliament of Canada could
authorize the Attorney General of Canada to conduct proceedings instituted at
the instance of the Government of Canada in respect of any breach or conspiracy
to commit a breach of a statute of the Parliament of Canada, other than the Criminal
Code . It is true that in the case at bar the charge against the accused was
that of conspiracy under s. 423  of the Criminal Code , but it is
clear that, had it wished to do so, Parliament could have provided for a
conspiracy to commit a breach of the Narcotic Control Act itself. This
course was not necessary in view of the provision contained in s. 115(2) 
of the Criminal Code . Additionally, s. 27(2) of the Interpretation
Act provides essentially that if Parliament can give the Attorney General
authority to institute proceedings for the enforcement of a federal statute, it
is necessarily incidental that, for the proper enforcement of such an Act, it
can also institute proceedings for a conspiracy to commit a breach of that Act.
There is no sound reason for now reconsidering the judgment in Hauser and
reversing it.

R. v. Hauser, [1979]
1 S.C.R. 984, applied; Cotroni v. Attorney General of Canada, [1976] 1
S.C.R. 219; Attorney General of Canada v. Higbie et al., [1945] S.C.R.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The issue in this appeal is as to
whether or not the Attorney General of Canada has the power to institute a
prosecution against the appellant for having conspired with others to import
drugs in contravention of subs. 5(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. N-1, which provides:

Except as authorized by this Act or the regulations,
no person shall import into Canada or export from Canada any narcotic.

The indictment charged that the appellant:

[TRANSLATION] Between the 22nd day of March
1975 and the 25th day of April 1976 unlawfully did conspire with Michel
Véronneau, Jean-Claude Pomerleau, Paul Pomerleau, Normand Pomerleau, Buddy
Wells, Amedh Hassan Chairi, Robert Barbeau, Claude Ménard, and with persons
unknown to this day to commit an indictable offence, namely to import narcotics
into Canada, namely about 50 pounds of hashish (Cannabis resin) contrary to
section 5(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, chap. N-1,
committing thereby an indictable offence contrary to section 423(1)  of the
Criminal Code .

The indictment was preferred by the Attorney
General for Canada and signed
by his agent. Following a lengthy trial, the appellant was convicted and
sentenced to a term of imprisonment for eight and one-half years.

The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal
for Quebec and, before that
Court, raised as a ground of appeal that the indictment was a nullity because
the Attorney General for Canada
did not have the right to prefer the indictment. It was the appellant’s
contention that only the Attorney General for Quebec had that right. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal upon this
ground, and

[Page 191]

so did not find it necessary to consider the
other grounds of appeal. At the time that the judgment of the Court of Appeal
was rendered, the judgment of this Court in R. v. Hauser[2] had not been delivered.

The right of the Attorney General of Canada to
institute these proceedings depends upon the definition of “Attorney General”
contained in s. 2  of the Criminal Code . That definition is as
follows:

“Attorney General” means the Attorney
General or Solicitor General of a province in which proceedings to which this
Act applies are taken and, with respect to

(a) the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory, and

(b) proceedings instituted at
the instance of the Government of Canada and conducted by or on behalf of that
Government in respect of a violation of or conspiracy to violate any Act of the
Parliament of Canada or a regulation made thereunder other than this Act,

means the Attorney General of Canada and,
except for the purposes of subsections 505(4) and 507(3), includes the
lawful deputy of the said Attorney General, Solicitor General and Attorney
General of Canada;

In the Hauser case, the accused had been
charged on two counts: (1) of possession of cannabis resin for the purpose of
trafficking and (2) of possession of cannabis for the purpose of trafficking.
The indictment had been signed by an agent of the Attorney General of Canada.
It was contended on behalf of the accused that the enactment of para. (b)
of the definition of “Attorney General” was ultra vires of the Parliament
of Canada. The constitutional question was settled by the Chief Justice of this
Court in these terms:

Is it within the competence of the
Parliament of Canada to enact legislation as in Section 2  of the Criminal
Code  to authorize the Attorney General of Canada or his Agent

(1) to prefer indictments for an offence
under the Narcotic Control Act,

(2) to have the conduct of proceedings
instituted at the instance of the Government of Canada in respect of a
violation or conspiracy to violate any Act of the

[Page 192]

Parliament of Canada or regulations made
thereunder other than the Criminal Code ?

(Hereinafter referred to as the “first question”
and the “second question”.)

The submission of the accused, supported by nine
provincial attorneys general, was that the proceedings were criminal in nature
and, therefore, could only be instituted by a provincial attorney general. It
was contended that this limitation of federal power was by reason of
s. 92(14) of the British North America Act (B.N.A. Act) which gave to
the provincial legislatures exclusive power to legislate in relation to the
administration of justice both criminal and civil in the province.

The position taken by the Attorney General of
Canada was that the institution of criminal proceedings was within the power of
the Attorney General of Canada by virtue of s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act
which gave to the federal Parliament power to legislate in relation to
criminal law and procedure in criminal matters. In any event, the proceedings
in question were not brought under the Criminal Code , but were brought
in respect of a violation of a federal statute (the Narcotic Control Act) other
than the Criminal Code , as provided in para. (b) of
the definition of “Attorney General”.

The appeal was heard by seven judges in this
Court. There was a division of opinion with respect to the first question.
Pigeon J., speaking for himself and three other members of the Court, answered
in the affirmative on the ground that the Narcotic Control Act was not
enacted pursuant to s. 91 (27) of the B.N.A. Act (criminal law) but
was enacted under the general residual power in s. 91 (peace, order and
good government). He expressed the view that the constitutional question, as
worded, did not put in issue the broad proposition submitted by the Attorney
General of Canada, i.e. complete federal legislative authority over the
conduct of all criminal proceedings.

Spence J. agreed with the contention of the
Attorney General of Canada as to the interpreta-

[Page 193]

tion of s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act. He
also held that the provincial power under s. 92(14) was limited by the
words “in the province” and did not include the enforcement and prosecution of
breaches of federal statutes. Accordingly, he answered the first question in
the affirmative.

The reasons of the other two members of the
Court were delivered by Dickson J. whose view was that the Narcotic Control
Act was, in pith and substance, criminal law and that, in consequence,
provincial supervisory control was maintained under s. 92(14) of the B.N.A.
Act in respect of the prosecution of offences under the Narcotic Control
Act. He was of the opinion that the first question should be answered in
the negative.

In respect of the answer to the first question,
the disagreement between the reasons of Pigeon J. and Dickson J. was as to
whether the Narcotic Control Act depended for its constitutional
validity upon s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act or upon some other
federal power.

In the result, the issue raised in the
first questions was answered in the affirmative by a majority of five to two.

The second question did not relate specifically,
as did the first question, to the Narcotic Control Act. By its terms it
raised the general question as to whether Parliament had the constitutional
authority to enact para. (b) of the definition of “Attorney
General” in the Criminal Code .

Pigeon J., for himself and three other members
of the Court, answered this question as follows:

Yes, in respect of a violation or
conspiracy to violate any Act of the Parliament of Canada or regulations made
thereunder the constitutional validity of which does not depend upon head 27 of
s. 91 of the British North America Act, no opinion being expressed
whether the competence of the Parliament of Canada extends beyond that point.

Spence J. answered the second question in the
affirmative.

[Page 194]

Dickson J., for himself and another member of
the Court, answered this question as follows:

(2) It is within the competence of the
Parliament of Canada to enact legislation, as in s. 2  of the Criminal
Code , to authorize the Attorney General of Canada, or his agent, to act as
the “Attorney General”, and indeed the only “Attorney General”, in
respect of a violation or conspiracy to violate an Act of Parliament enacted
under any head of power in s. 91 of the British North America Act,
other than head 27 relating to the criminal law power.

The Hauser case has decided that in
respect of the enforcement of federal statutes, whose constitutional validity
does not depend upon s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act, the Attorney
General of Canada has the right to initiate proceedings for a violation or a
conspiracy to violate such statute, and a majority of the Court has decided
that the Narcotic Control Act is such a statute.

The Attorney General of Canada contends that the
judgment in the Hauser case should govern the disposition of this
appeal.

The respondent and the provincial attorneys
general who were interveners contend that the Hauser case is not
conclusive. It was argued that the Hauser case involved an alleged
violation of the Narcotic Control Act and was not concerned with a
conspiracy to violate that Act. It was submitted that the answer given
unanimously to the second question, in so far as it dealt with a conspiracy to
violate, was obiter and without binding effect. The argument is that in
the present case the respondent was charged with having committed a criminal
act in breach of para. 423(1) (d) of the Criminal Code , which
is an offence separate and distinct from the commission of the offence to which
the conspiracy relates. As the offence charged is an offence under the Criminal
Code , the Attorney General of Canada does not have authority to institute
proceedings in respect of it.

I am not in agreement with these contentions.

It is clear that the second question formulated
by the Chief Justice put in issue the power of the Attorney General of Canada
to have the conduct

[Page 195]

of proceedings instituted at the instance of the
Government of Canada in respect of any conspiracy to violate a federal statute
other than the Criminal Code . That question was answered unanimously in
the affirmative in respect of statutes whose validity was not dependent upon
s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act.

The substance of the answer given to the
question is that Parliament can provide for the enforcement of such statutes.
This power includes the institution and carriage of proceedings for that
purpose.

It is true that the charge against the
respondent was for conspiracy under para. 423(1) (d) of the Criminal
Code  but it is clear that, had it wished to do so, Parliament could have
provided for a conspiracy to violate the Act in the Narcotic Control Act itself,
as it has done in para. 239(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act. This
course was not necessary in view of the provision contained in subs. 115(2) of
the Criminal Code . Section 115  provides:

115. (1)
Every one who, without lawful excuse contravenes an Act of the Parliament of
Canada by wilfully doing anything that it forbids or by wilfully omitting to do
anything that it requires to be done is, unless some penalty or punishment is
expressly provided by law, guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for two years.

(2) Any proceedings in respect of a
contravention of or conspiracy to contravene an Act mentioned in subsection (1),
other than this Act, may be instituted at the instance of the Government of
Canada and conducted by or on behalf of that Government.

The provision contained in subs. (2) has the
same effect as if it had been specifically enacted, in substance, in the Narcotic
Control Act. The mere fact that it appears as a general provision in the Criminal
Code  does not affect its constitutional validity.

Reference may also be made to subs. 27(2) of the
Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23:

27. (2) All
the provisions of the Criminal Code  relating to indictable offences
apply to indictable offences created by an enactment, and all the provisions of
the Criminal Code  relating to summary conviction offences apply to all
other offences created by an enactment,

[Page 196]

except to the extent that the enactment
otherwise provides.

“Enactment” is defined as an Act of the
Parliament of Canada, or a regulation.

The essence of the matter is that if Parliament
can give to the Attorney General of Canada authority to institute proceedings
for the enforcement of a federal statute, it is necessarily incidental that,
for the proper enforcement of such an Act, it can also institute proceedings
for a conspiracy to violate that Act.

In considering this issue, I do not agree with the
contention of the respondent that we should consider the charge made against
the respondent of conspiring to import narcotics without reference to the
offence, i.e. the unlawful importation of narcotics, to which the
conspiracy relates. While it is true that conspiracy is, in itself, a crime
distinct from the unlawful act to which it relates, we are entitled, in dealing
with the constitutional issue before us, to give consideration to the nature of
the conspiracy.

The nature of a conspiracy to traffic in
narcotics was considered by this Court in Cotroni v. Attorney General of
Canada[3]. That
case involved the validity of a warrant of committal under the Extradition
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21. The charge against the appellant in the United States was for conspiracy to import
a narcotic drug. It was contended that conspiring to import a narcotic drug was
not listed in Schedule I to the Extradition Act  although certain other
conspiracies were so listed. Extradition crimes were defined in s. 2 of
the Act:

“extradition crime” may mean any crime
that, if committed in Canada, or within Canadian jurisdiction, would be one of
the crimes described in Schedule I; and, in the application of this Act to the
case of any extradition arrangement, “extradition crime” means any crime
described in such arrangement, whether or not it is comprised in that Schedule;

By a Supplementary Convention in 1925, there was
added a classification, “Crimes and offences against the laws for the
suppression of the traffic

[Page 197]

in narcotics”. This convention was an
“extradition arrangement” within the meaning of the definition in s. 2 .
The question in issue was as to whether a conspiracy to import a narcotic was
within the classification defined in the convention. Spence J., who delivered the
judgment of this Court, said, at pp. 222-23:

I am of the opinion that it matters not
whether the particular indictment, had it been laid in Canada, would have been laid under the provisions of the Criminal Code  or
the Narcotic Control Act or in fact any other statute. The test is what
is the essence of the crime charged. I am also of the opinion that the essence
of the crime charged in the indictment by the United States Grand Jury was and
only could be for a crime against the laws for the suppression of the traffic
in narcotics.

It was submitted in argument that the answer to
the second question was merely an opinion and did not have binding effect. The
answer made was in respect of a constitutional issue raised in the proceedings.
It is certainly entitled to the same weight as an answer given to a question
posed in a reference to the Court and, as to that, Rinfret C.J. in Attorney
General of Canada v. Higbie et al.[4], after
referring to a judgment of this Court, said at p. 403:

It is needless to mention here that,
although this was not a judgment in the true sense of the word, but merely what
is sometimes referred to as an opinion made in a Reference to this Court by the
Governor General in Council as provided for by section 55 of the Supreme
Court Act and the special jurisdiction therein given to this Court, we
should regard an opinion of that kind as binding upon this Court and, moreover,
one which, in the particular circumstances and in view of the wide experience
in these matters which must be recognized to Mr. Justice Newcombe, cannot
be held but as having the greatest weight and authority.

Finally, we were urged in argument to reconsider
and reverse our judgment in the Hauser case. That case was decided on
May 1, 1979, after a full argument in which the attorneys general of nine
provinces participated. In my opinion, there is no sound reason for now
reversing it.

[Page 198]

I would allow the appeal and set aside the
judgment of the Court of Appeal. As it appears that the respondent had other
grounds of appeal besides the one considered in this Court and not dealt with
by the Court of Appeal, I would return the case to the Court of Appeal for
consideration of the respondent’s other grounds of appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR NOVA
SCOTIA

Trial—Jury—Jury’s verdict set aside as perverse
and unreasonable—Whether or not trial judge had exceeded his authority in
rendering judgment inconsistent with the jury’s verdict—Judicature Act, 1972
(N.S.), c. 2, s. 31(6)(c)—Rules of Court, Rule 34.09(4).

Appellants’ action to enforce the “Double
Indemnity Accident Rider” provision of a life insurance policy was dismissed by
the trial judge despite the jury’s finding. The insurance company had alleged
that the insured, who died in a traffic accident, had been driving while
legally impaired and therefore while committing a criminal offence contrary to
the insurance policy’s provision providing for double indemnity. The trial
judge accepted the jury’s finding that the death was accidental but set aside
as perverse and unreasonable the conclusion that death had not occurred, in
whole or in part, from the commission of a criminal offence. Notwithstanding
changes effected in the Rules of Court, a majority of the Court of Appeal found
the jury’s verdict to have been properly set aside and rejected the argument
that the trial judge had exceeded his authority in rendering judgment
inconsistent with that verdict.

Held (Ritchie
J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Estey, McIntyre and Chouinard JJ.: Under the current Judicature Act
and Rules, a trial judge sitting with a jury was required to enter judgment
not inconsistent with the jury’s findings. By relying on the trial judge’s
assessment of the evidence and endorsing his verdict, the Court of Appeal
veered away from its proper function in reviewing a jury verdict—determining
whether there was evidence upon which a jury

[Page 139]

could have properly reached its conclusion,
unembarrassed by the contrary position of the trial judge. While not bound to
yield automatic obedience to the jury’s findings, the Court of Appeal,
nevertheless owed them a degree of respect. The jury had not been unresponsive
to the questions put to it and did not refuse to answer questions requiring an
answer. It was open to the jury to conclude the evidence of impairment was not
satisfactory, and to reject it. This was not a case calling for the Court of
Appeal’s interference with the jury’s findings.

Of equal importance was causation: whether or
not there was impairment, and if so, whether or not it resulted in the ensuing
accident and death. Although both issues were “wrapped up” in the same question
put to the jury, the jury’s answer could be taken to cover either or both
issues and was entitled to be regarded in as favourable a light as the evidence
supporting it.

Per Ritchie
J., dissenting: The trial judge was required to “give a judgment in the
proceedings not inconsistent with the answers of the jury”. The Court of
Appeal, however, was not bound by any such rule and, in making the order
appealed from, was exercising its power to make the order which it considered
the appeal to require having regard to the evidence. The correct principles
were applied in that Court’s review both of the actions taken by the trial
judge and of the jury’s finding. The conclusion that Cameron was committing a
criminal offence at the time of his death was not improbable and the
evidence was overwhelmingly in favour of the defendant (respondent). In the
absence of satisfactory reasons justifying the adoption of the extraordinary course
of ignoring concurrent findings in reaching the result, no jury properly
instructed and acting judicially could have given the answers given.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia[1],
dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Hallett J. Appeal allowed.

plaintiffs, appellants.

John M. Barker, for the defendant,
respondent.

[Page 140]

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Estey, McIntyre
and Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—I have had the advantage of
reading the reasons prepared by my brother Ritchie and I agree with him that
the changes in the Nova Scotia Judicature Act, 1972 (N.S.), c. 2 and in
the Rules of Court, especially as reflected in s. 31(6)(c) of the Act and
New Rule 34.09(4) which is in conformity with s. 31(6)(c), had the effect
of limiting the power of a trial judge to enter judgment as he thinks right,
notwithstanding the findings of a jury. As I read the present Judicature Act
and the present Rules, and approving as I do the dissenting opinions of
Hart and Jones JJ.A., a trial judge sitting with a jury is now required to
enter judgment not inconsistent with the jury’s findings.

This is not what the trial judge, Hallett J.,
did in the present case. He entered judgment in direct opposition to the jury’s
finding on the critical issues in the case. The jury was asked the following
questions, numbered 1 and 2(a) and 2(b) and gave its answers as indicated under
the questions:

1. Did the death of the late Gordon Herman
Cameron result directly and independently of all other causes, from bodily
injury caused solely by external, violent and accidental means? Answer Yes or
No.

Answer: Yes.

2. (a) Did the death of the late Gordon
Herman Cameron result, either directly or indirectly, in whole or part, from
committing or attempting to commit a criminal offence? Answer Yes or No.

Answer: No.

2. (b) If your answer to questions number
2(a) is ‘Yes’ state what criminal offence or offences the late Gordon Herman
Cameron was committing or attempting to commit.

Answer: N/A.

The majority of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal,
speaking through MacKeigan C.J.N.S., took the view, wrongly as I have said,
that a trial judge sitting with a jury was still entitled, despite changes in
the Judicature Act and in the Rules, to

[Page 141]

enter such judgment as he thinks right although
it results in setting aside the findings of the jury. In taking this position,
in endorsement of what Hallett J. decided, the Court of Appeal veered away from
its proper function when called upon to review a jury verdict, namely, to see
whether there was evidence upon which a jury could reasonably have reached its
conclusion and to do so unembarrassed by the contrary position of the trial
judge in entering a judgment which sweeps aside the jury’s findings.

I agree, of course, that the changes in the Judicature
Act and in the Rules did not affect the powers of the Court of Appeal. It
certainly was not bound to yield automatic obedience to the jury’s findings
but, at the same time, the jury’s findings were entitled to respect. As Jones
J.A. noted in his dissenting reasons, there was no motion to dismiss the action
for want of evidence. By leaving the case to the jury, the trial judge must
have been of the opinion that there was evidence upon which it could come to a
reasonable conclusion on the two central issues in the case, namely, did the
deceased commit or attempt to commit a criminal offence and, second, did his
death result directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from such conduct.
This is not a case where the jury’s answers were not responsive to the
questions put to it nor is it a case where it refused to answer questions that
required an answer. Had that situation arisen, the judge would have been
warranted in discharging the jury and might have obtained consent to proceed
alone.

The Court of Appeal majority considered the
evidence but it did not review it in the detail exhibited in the dissenting
reasons of Hart J.A. Detailed consideration is not an invariable requirement,
but what is obvious here is that MacKeigan C.J.N.S. accepted the appraisal of
Hallett J. Since it was not for the trial judge to veer from the findings of
the jury, the reliance of the Court of Appeal on his assessment of the evidence
was unfortunate.

[Page 142]

I do not propose to enter upon any extended
consideration of the evidence because that has been adequately done by Hart
J.A. I do wish, however, to refer to what seems to have been the decisive
factor in the conclusion that the deceased Cameron was guilty of a criminal
offence, namely, the alcohol content in his blood. There was evidence that the
blood sample offered in evidence as his blood showed a reading of 370 which, if
true, would, as a probability, have meant that he could not possibly be fit to
drive. There was also some evidence to indicate a mix-up of that sample, said
to be of the blood of the deceased Cameron, with another sample which showed a
reading of 70, that is, within the allowable limit. Furthermore, there was
evidence that Cameron’s driving, minutes before the accident, appeared normal,
and that in conversation he appeared to be in good shape. As a result, it was
open to the jury to conclude that the evidence of impairment was not
satisfactory and to reject it.

Of equal importance was causation. If there was
impairment, did it result in the ensuing accident and the deaths that occurred?
The burden on both of these issues was on the insurer which was resisting the
double indemnity coverage of the deceased Cameron’s life insurance policy by
relying on a limitation which would apply if death resulted, directly or
indirectly, in whole or in part from committing, attempting or provoking an
assault or criminal offence. Both the issue of impairment and the issue of
causation were wrapped up in question 2(a), and I agree with Hart J.A. that it
would have been better to have separated them for answer by the jury. As it
was, the jury’s answer “No” to question 2(a) could be taken to cover either or
both issues. Jury’s findings are, however, entitled to rational appreciation
and to be regarded in as favourable a light as the evidence supporting it.

That there was evidence supporting a “No” answer
to the question whether the accident resulted from alleged impairment is
disclosed in the following summary in the reasons of Hart J.A.:

[Page 143]

Secondly, the jury could properly have
reached the conclusion that the accident happened as a result of the sudden
veering to the left of the truck rather than the theory of the defendant that
placed the Cameron vehicle entirely on its wrong side of the road before the
accident and required it to be returning to its own side of the road when it
collided with the truck. The only thing certain about the evidence appears to
be the slight angle at which the vehicles came in contact, which would be
equally consistent with both theories as to how the accident could have
happened. The jury had before them the evidence of several witnesses who all
indicated that the accident scene was on the Cameron side of the road, and against
this only the evidence of Constable Grimmer who said that the truck had not
crossed the centre line before the impact. The jury had the opportunity of
observing all of these witnesses and deciding which part of the evidence they
would accept. In my opinion it is not for this Court to disagree with their
findings when there is some evidence upon which they could have reached the
conclusion that they did.

I agree with him that this was not a case that
called for interference by a Court of Appeal with the findings of the jury.

In the result, I would allow the appeal, set
aside the judgment of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal and the judgment of
Hallett J. and direct that judgment be entered for the appellants in accordance
with the findings of the jury. The appellants are entitled to their costs
throughout.

The following are the reasons delivered by

RITCHIE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
brought with leave of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia
from a judgment of that Court dismissing an appeal from the judgment given at
trial by Mr. Justice Hallett sitting with a jury, whereby he had dismissed
the action brought by the appellants to enforce the “Double Indemnity Accident
Rider” provision of a $100,000 life insurance policy issued by the respondent
on the life of Gordon H. Cameron, the husband of the appellant, Kathleen
Cameron and father of the other appellants, who was killed in a head-on
collision between his motor vehicle which was operated by him and an
approaching truck.

[Page 144]

The respondent insurer paid the first $100,000
under the main provisions of the insurance policy but denied liability in
respect of the double indemnity accident rider which was attached thereto on
the dual grounds that:

(i) the death of the life insured was not
caused as the result of an accident, and

(ii) that the death resulted either
directly or indirectly from ‘his driving a motor vehicle… having consumed
alcohol in excess of the limitations provided by s. 236(1)  of the Criminal
Code  and that he had therefore committed a criminal offence contrary to the
provisions of that subsection at the time of the collision which resulted
in his death’.

By the “Double Indemnity Accident Rider” the
insurer agreed to pay an additional $100,000 upon receipt of satisfactory proof
that the death of the life insured was caused solely by accident and which
provided also that:

The benefit provided by this rider will not
apply if the life insured’s death shall result either directly or indirectly,
in whole or part from any of the following:

1. Suicide or self-inflicted injuries while
sane or insane.

2. Committing, attempting or provoking an
assault or criminal offense.

In due course, after a lengthy trial before
Mr. Justice Hallett sitting with a jury, the following questions were put
to the jury:

1. Did the death of the late Gordon Herman
Cameron result directly and independently of all other causes, from bodily
injury caused solely by external, violent and accidental means? Answer Yes or
No.

Answer: Yes.

2. (a) Did the death of the late Gordon
Herman Cameron result, either directly or indirectly, in whole or part, from
committing or attempting to commit a criminal offence? Answer Yes or No.

Answer: No.

Following the jury’s findings the appellants’
counsel moved for judgment for $100,000 and costs to be taxed and the
defendant’s counsel

[Page 145]

moved that the finding of the jury on question
2(a) be set aside as being perverse. After reserving his decision on this
motion, the learned trial judge prepared and delivered written reasons for
judgment in which he concluded that the finding on question 2(a) was so plainly
unreasonable and unjust that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and
acting judicially could have reached it and he accordingly set that finding
aside saying:

On a review of the whole of the evidence, I
find that the death of Mr. Cameron resulted, either directly or
indirectly, in whole or part from the commission of a criminal offence; namely,
the offence of driving his motor vehicle with an alcohol content in his blood
in excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood, being an
offence against s. 236(1)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

In conformity with this judgment the appellants’
action was dismissed but in asserting an appeal to the Appeal Division it was
argued that under the Rules of Court in the Province of Nova Scotia the trial
judge was required to “give judgment in the action not inconsistent with the
answers of the jury” and that Mr. Justice Hallett exceeded his authority
in rendering a judgment which was clearly inconsistent with the answer to
question 2(a).

It is clear that prior to the enactment of the Judicature
Act, 1972 (N.S.), c. 2, a trial judge sitting with a jury was free to give
judgment “as he thinks right” notwithstanding a contrary verdict having been
rendered by the jury. This is made clear from the very comprehensive judgment
of Cooper J.A., in Silver’s Garage Limited v. The Town of Bridgewater which
was affirmed in this Court[2] and
also in the case of Manuge v. Dominion Atlantic Railway[3]. The ratio decidendi of the Silver’s
Garage[4] case is
to be found in a judgment of Mr. Justice Cooper, where he said, at
p. 164:

[Page 146]

I am of the opinion that the trial Judge
could review the findings of the jury and give judgment for the Town if upon
such review he came to the conclusion, as in fact he did, that the findings
were such that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting reasonably
could have reached.

Order XXXIV, rule 32 of the rules of the
Supreme Court reads:

“The judge shall, at or after trial, direct
judgment to be entered as he thinks right, and no motion for judgment shall be
necessary.”

The trial Judge also referred to
s. 42(6) of the Judicature Act, 1950. It provides, in part, that
the judge, except in certain actions of which this is not one, may direct the
jury to answer any questions of fact raised by the issues instead of directing
the jury to give either a general or special verdict, that such questions may
be stated to them by the judge and counsel may require the judge to direct the
jury to answer any other questions raised by the issues or necessary to be
answered by the jury to obtain a complete determination of all matters involved
in the action. Clause (c) of s. 42(6) reads:

“(c) The jury shall answer such questions,
and shall not give any verdict, and the judge shall give a judgment in the
action not inconsistent with the answers of the jury to such questions.”

But the opening words of s. 42 are
“Subject to rules of court”. It is my view therefore that rule 32 of Order
XXXIV and the relevant authorities cited by the trial Judge enabled him to take
the course which he did.

This reasoning was adopted by the majority of
the Appeal Division in finding that the verdict of the jury was properly set
aside and therefore dismissing the appeal notwithstanding the changes effected
in the Rules of Court at the time of the enactment of the Judicature Act on
March 1, 1972.

I take it to be established that under The
Judicature Act, 1950, which was in force at the time of the Silver’s
Garage case, a trial judge was free to direct “judgment to be entered as he
thinks right”, but the accident with which we are here concerned occurred in
1977 and the question raised by the present circumstances is whether the
amendments effected by the 1972 statute so altered the rules applicable to
trials with a jury

[Page 147]

that the trial judge is now required to “give
a judgment in the action not inconsistent with the answers of the jury”.

Under the new Act the provisions of what was
previously clause (c) of s. 42(6), which is referred to by
Mr. Justice Cooper were continued unchanged as s. 31(6)(c) and
have also been repeated in Rule 34.09(4) and the former Order XXXIV, Rule 32,
cited above finds its counterpart in Rule 30.09 which is referrable to trials
generally and which provides:

30.09 The court may, at or after the trial,
direct judgment to be entered as it thinks right.

At the time of the Silver’s Garage judgment
it was correct to state that the phrase “subject to the Rules of Court” as it
occurs in s. 42 was enough to support the argument that Order XXXIV, Rule
32, was paramount to the provisions of s. 42(6)(c) and that the
trial judge was accordingly free to enter such judgment as he thought right
notwithstanding the jury’s findings, but under the new statute a new rule has
been added to Rule 34 and as Rule 34.09(4) it reads, in part, as follows:

34.09 …

(4) The jury shall answer any question of
fact without giving a verdict, and the court shall give a judgment in the proceeding
not inconsistent with the answers of the jury.

The provisions of s. 43(2) of the 1972 Judicature
Act provide that:

…the Civil Procedure Rules made by the
Judges of the Supreme Court on the second day of December, 1971, a copy of
which is deposited in the office of the Provincial Secretary are hereby
ratified and confirmed and are declared to be the Civil Procedure Rules of the
Supreme Court and shall have the force of law on and after the first of
March, 1972…

It thus appears to me that while the requirement
for a judge to give judgment “not inconsistent with the answers of the jury”
was subject to the Rules of Court and therefore to Order XXXIV, Rule 32, prior
to 1972 that rule can no longer be accorded precedence because new Rule 34.09
is given the force of law by s. 43 of the new Judicature Act

[Page 148]

and being a Rule of Court itself it can no
longer be treated as subject to Rule 30.09.

I am accordingly in agreement with the
dissenting view expressed by Mr. Justice Hart and Mr. Justice Jones
that the trial judge in the present case was required by Rule 34.09 to “give a
judgment in the proceedings not inconsistent with the answers of the jury”. I
am however of opinion that the Appeal Division was not bound by any such rule.
If it were otherwise it would mean that the jury’s answers were immutable and
immune from review in any court whereas all the judges in the Appeal Division
in the present case engaged in an extensive review of the evidence and of the
jury’s conclusions notwithstanding the dissenting view that Rule 34.09 was
binding on the trial judge. The authority to exercise this appellate
jurisdiction does not appear to have been seriously questioned.

Provision is made for appeals to the Appellate
Division by s. 35(1) of the Judicature Act of Nova Scotia (1972) in
the following terms:

35 (1)
Except where it is otherwise provided by any enactment, an appeal lies to the
Appeal Division from any decision, verdict, judgment or order of the Trial
Division or a Judge thereof whether in Court or in Chambers.

In the course of his dissenting reasons for
judgment in the Appeal Division, Mr. Justice Hart observed:

It is further contended in this appeal that
if the trial judge did not have the authority to set aside the findings of the
jury as being perverse that this Court should do so. By Rule 62.23(1)(b) the
Appeal Division has power to ‘draw inferences of fact and give any judgment,
allow any amendment, or make any order which might have been made by the court
appealed from or which the appeal may require’. [The italics are my
own.]

I agree with this contention and conclude that
in making the order appealed from in this case the Appeal Division was
exercising its power to make

[Page 149]

the order which it considered the appeal to
“require” having regard to the evidence.

I think it must be recognized that this is not
in the true sense an appeal from the verdict of a jury, but rather an appeal
from the conclusions reached by a trial judge and expressed in lengthy reasons
for judgment. We are thus concerned with different findings of fact on almost
all the vital elements of this case; the one made by the jury and the other by
the learned trial judge.

The parties to this appeal are agreed that the
following are the issues before this Court:

1. Did the Learned Trial Judge under the
new Civil Procedure Rules of Nova Scotia have power to give judgment
inconsistent with the answers of the Jury and set aside the Jury finding?

2. If a Trial Judge has power to give
judgment inconsistent with the answers of the Jury did the Learned Trial Judge
in the case at bar apply correct principles in his review of the Jury finding
and in turn did the Court of Appeal apply correct principles in its review of
both the action taken by the Learned Trial Judge and its review of the jury
finding?

3. Apart from 1 and 2 herein was there
evidence upon which the Jury finding can be supported?

As I have indicated, I take the view that the
learned trial judge did not have power to give judgment inconsistent with the
findings of the jury, that no such restriction was binding on the Appeal
Division and that it therefore becomes necessary to consider whether that Court
applied “correct principles in its review of both the action taken by the
learned trial judge and its review of the jury’s finding”.

The principles to be applied by the Appeal
Division are described by Mr. Justice de Grandpré in Vancouver-Fraser
Park District v. Olmstead[5], at pp.
836-9 where he says at p. 838:

[Page 150]

Of course, the principle has been repeated
in many judgments of this Court and it is sufficient at this time to refer to
one other case, namely the classic decision of McCannell v. McLean, [1937]
S.C.R. 341, where Duff C.J. stated the rule that “the verdict of a jury will
not be set aside as against the weight of evidence unless it is so plainly
unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy the Court that no jury reviewing the
evidence as a whole and acting judicially could have reached it”.

The approach adopted by the Appeal Division in
this case is well summarized in the reasons for judgment of Chief Justice
MacKeigan where he said:

We as an appeal court must review the
entire evidence and Mr. Justice Hallett’s decision, with proper respect
for any findings of specific fact or credibility made by him, and with careful
regard to the many points advanced by counsel for the appellant. We must
consider whether we also are compelled to the same overall inference and
conclusion, namely, that the verdict was, using Chief Justice Duffs words, ‘so
plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy the Court that no jury reviewing
the evidence as a whole and acting judicially could have reached it’.

I have reviewed this case with care. I am
unable to detect any reversible error in Mr. Justice Hallett’s
comprehensive decision. I agree with him that the evidence ‘was overwhelmingly
in favour of the defendant’, that the verdict was plainly unreasonable and
unjust, and that the jury did not act judicially in reaching it.

As to the third question, I think it must be
accepted that if the finding of the jury is so plainly unreasonable and unjust
as to satisfy the Court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and
acting judicially could have reached it, then it cannot be said that there was
evidence upon which the jury finding could be supported.

The burden resting on the respondent in the
present case was to satisfy the Court on the balance of probabilities that
Cameron’s death resulted from his committing a criminal offence. It is true
that there were some items in the evidence which if believed by the jury might
sustain a verdict in the appellants’ favour, but it is the

[Page 151]

evidence as a whole which has to be
considered here and the uncontradicted evidence that Cameron’s alcoholic blood
count was 370 while operating his motor vehicle, whereas 80 is the maximum
permitted under s.236(1)  of the Criminal Code , when taken in conjunction
with the evidence of two witnesses who described his condition as consistent
with his having been consuming alcohol immediately before he entered his car,
which evidence is also uncontradicted, cast such a dark shadow over the whole
of the proceedings as to satisfy me that it is more than probable that he was
in breach of s. 236(1)  of the Criminal Code  and therefore
committing a criminal offence when he came to his death. It certainly cannot be
said in my view that such a conclusion is improbable and having regard to the
standard of proof required under the present circumstances, I am, like the
Appeal Division, satisfied that the evidence “was overwhelmingly in favour of
the defendant” (respondent).

As will be seen, I am of opinion that the Appeal
Division applied the correct principle in its review of both the action taken
by the trial judge and of the jury’s finding.

Moreover, as I have said, it is to be borne in
mind that this appeal to the Appeal Division was from the reasons for judgment
of the trial judge rather than from the answers or verdict of the jury and it
will be seen that in reaching his conclusion Chief Justice MacKeigan, on behalf
of the Appeal Division, gave “proper respect to any specific findings of fact
or credibility” made by Hallett J. at the trial.

The conclusion reached by the Appeal Division
rested upon a pure finding of fact and indeed having regard to the fact that
that Court based its determination in such large degree upon its concurrence
with the judge who presided at the trial, I think it can be said that, in a
very real sense, there were concurrent findings of fact supporting the
conclusion reached by Chief Justice MacKeigan. No reason has been advanced to
satisfy me that there is any justification for adopting the extraordinary
course of ignoring such concurrent findings in reaching the result which they
so clearly

[Page 152]

indicated and I am accordingly of opinion that
no jury properly instructed and acting judicially could have given the answer
which was given in the present case to question 2(a) and I would accordingly
dismiss this appeal with costs.

The reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice
Hallett are now conveniently reported in (1978), 88 D.L.R. (3d) 39, and those
of the Appeal Division similarly reported in (1979), 32 N.S.R. (2d) 668.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC.

Criminal low—Refusal of a child to
testify—Conviction for contempt of court—Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C 1970,
c. J-3, ss. 8, 28—Criminal Code , ss. 8 , 9 .

Appellant, who was then fifteen years old,
was called as a witness in the trial of the accused before a judge and twelve
jurors. As a result of his refusal to testify, the judge of the Superior Court,
criminal side, hearing the case, sentenced him to two months’ detention. The
judge had previously dismissed the preliminary objection regarding his
jurisdiction ratione personae: appellant argued that he was a child
within the meaning of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, and that his case
could only be heard by a judge of the Youth Court. The Court of Appeal upheld
the judgment: hence the appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

It was admitted that if the refusal by the
child to testify constituted a Criminal Code  offence, the Youth Court
had sole jurisdiction. However, in the case at bar, no charge was laid against
appellant for a breach of any provision of the Criminal Code  or for any
other offence making him liable to be committed to an industrial school or
juvenile reformatory. Appellant was not prosecuted under s. 8 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act. As he pointed out himself, the judge acted in accordance
with the inherent power of the Court to impose penalties for contempt committed
“in the face” of the Court. In the case at bar, the judge was exercising this
power by imposing a penalty for the refusal by appellant to testify, and the
power may be exercised even with respect to a witness covered by the Juvenile
Delinquents Act.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Quebec,
affirming a conviction for contempt of court by a judge of the Superior Court,
criminal side. Appeal dismissed.

Guy Roy, for the appellant.

Paul Chevalier, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

CHOUINARD J.—Appellant, who was then fifteen
years old, a child within the meaning of the Juvenile Delinquent Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. J-3, was given two months’ detention for contempt of court as a result
of his refusal to testify.

The question is whether the judge of the
Superior Court, criminal side, could impose such a penalty or whether appellant
should have been tried in the Social Welfare Court, now the Youth Court.

Counsel for the appellant submitted the
following summary, which counsel for the respondent described as “scrupulously
in accordance with the facts”:

[TRANSLATION] On November 22, 1976
appellant, Serge Vaillancourt, was convicted of contempt of Court by Jean
Moisan, J.S.C., as a result of his refusal to answer certain questions put to
him by counsel for the prosecution and the judge during his testimony in the
case of Evans Ward.

Mr. Evans Ward was charged with rape and
tried before a judge and twelve jurors in the district of Mingan. Appellant was
called as a witness by the Crown counsel and asked to testify concerning events
involving Mr. Ward. When he appeared in court, appellant answered a number
of questions put by the Crown counsel. However, at some point, appellant refused
to answer any more questions. In view of this situation, Jean Moisan, J.S.C.
cited appellant for contempt of court and deferred the hearing on this contempt
to October 28, 1976, to allow
appellant to obtain counsel.

[Page 71]

On October 28, 1976 appellant appeared
before Jean Moisan J.S.C., accompanied by his counsel, to be tried on the
charge of contempt of court. At this appearance counsel for the appellant
raised a preliminary objection to the honourable trial judge’s jurisdiction
ratione personae. This objection was debated at length and the judgment on the
objection handed down on November 22, 1976.

Finally, on November 22, 1976 the trial
judge rendered judgment on the objection made by counsel for the appellant and
dismissed the Iatter’s arguments regarding his jurisdiction ratione personae.

Following this dismissal appellant was
convicted of contempt of court and representations were made on either side as
to his sentence.

As a result of the representations on
sentencing, appellant was ordered to serve two (2) months in prison, with a
recommendation that this sentence be served at the Foyer Richelieu in the Town
of Hauterive, an institution specializing in youth below the age of eighteen
(18).

Appellant’s argument is that as he is a child
within the meaning of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, his case could only
be heard by a judge of the Youth Court. He maintained that his refusal to
testify constitutes a criminal offence, one that is covered by the definition
of juvenile delinquent. Accordingly, under s. 8(1) of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, and aside from the exception in s. 9  authorizing
referral to the ordinary courts, he can only be tried before the Youth Court.

Section 2(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act defines
juvenile delinquent as follows:

“Juvenile delinquent” means any child who
violates any provision of the Criminal Code  or of any federal or
provincial statute, or of any by-law or ordinance of any municipality, or who
is guilty of sexual immorality or any similar form of vice, or who is liable by
reason of any other act to be committed to an industrial school or juvenile
reformatory under any federal or provincial statute.

Respondent admitted that the Youth Court has
sole jurisdiction if, as appellant maintained, his refusal to testify made him
a “child who violates

[Page 72]

any provision of the Criminal Code …”
within the meaning of this subsection, or in the French version of the same
subsection “un enfant qui commet une infraction à quelqu’une des
dispositions du Code criminel…”.

However, respondent submitted that appellant’s
sentence did not result from a conviction for a Criminal Code  offence,
or any other offence, but from the inherent power of the Court [TRANSLATION]
“to punish any action likely to detract from the respect due to the Court or
interfere with the administration of justice”.

The power enjoyed by a court at common law to
impose a penalty for contempt of court was preserved when, in 1953-54, the Criminal
Code  was amended to abolish common law offences. It is contained in
s. 8  Cr. C., which reads as follows:

8.
Notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act no person shall be
convicted

(a) of an offence at common
law,

(b) of an offence under an
Act of the Parliament of England, or of Great Britain, or of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland, or

(c) of an offence under an Act or
ordinance in force in any province, territory or place before that province,
territory or place became a province of Canada,

but nothing in this section affects
the power, jurisdiction or authority that a court, judge, justice or magistrate
had, immediately before the 1st day of April 1955, to impose punishment for
contempt of court.

As the trial judge observed:

[TRANSLATION] The first point to be noted
from reading this section is that the legislator makes a very clear
distinction between an offence contained in the Criminal Code  or in an Act or
ordinance in force, and the power, jurisdiction or authority of a Court
to impose a penalty for contempt of court. He has accordingly created a very
clear distinction between offences and crimes on the one hand, and the power to
impose a penalty for contempt of court on the other.

There is no question that the refusal to be
sworn or testify constitutes a contempt of court committed “in the face” of the
Court according to the

[Page 73]

wording of the Criminal Code  (s. 9 ). See Re
Gerson, Re Nightingale[1].

There is no question in the case at bar that the
contempt of court was committed “in the face” of the Court.

It is possible that appellant could have been
charged with disobeying an order of the Court under s. 116  Cr.C ., or
with obstructing justice under s. 127 , and that in such a case only the
Youth Court would have had jurisdiction, in accordance with the Juvenile
Delinquents Act. However, it is not necessary to decide this point because
that is not the case.

No charge was laid against appellant for a
breach of any provision of the Criminal Code  or of any federal or
provincial statute, or of any by-law or ordinance of any municipality,… or for
any other offence making him liable to be committed to an industrial school or
juvenile reformatory. Appellant was not prosecuted under s. 8 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act. As he pointed out himself, the judge hearing the case at
bar acted in accordance with the inherent power of the Court to impose
penalties for contempt committed “in the face” of the Court.

In Re Gerson, Re Nightingale, supra, Kerwin
J., as he then was, commenting on ss. 165 and 180 Cr. C., now ss. 116 
and 127  respectively, said for the Court at p. 549:

The argument on this point was that the
applicant could be prosecuted under either of these sections and that
these proceedings being available the right of the Court to punish for a
contempt had been abrogated. Without deciding whether either of these
sections would apply in the circumstances, we are of opinion that even if
that were so it is a necessary incident to every superior Court of justice to
imprison for a contempt of Court committed in the face of it.

This inherent power has been recognized for

[Page 74]

several hundred years. In R. v. Almon[2], Wilmot J. expressed the following
opinion at p. 99:

The power which the Courts in Westminster
Hall have of vindicating their own authority, is coeval with their first
foundation and institution; it is a necessary incident to every court of
Justice, whether of record or not, to fine and imprison for a contempt to the
Court, acted in the face of it, 1 Vent. 1. And the issuing of attachments by
the Supreme Courts of Justice in Westminster Hall, for contempts out of Court,
stands upon the same immemorial usage as supports the whole fabrik of the
common law; it is as much as the “lex terrae”, and within the exception of
Magna Charta, as the issuing any other legal process whatsoever.

In In re Johnson[3], Bowen J. of the British Court of
Queen’s Bench observed at p. 74:

The law has armed the High Court of Justice
with power and imposed on it the duty of preventing brevi manu and by
summary proceedings any attempt to interfere with the administration of justice.

In Morris v. The Crown Office[4], Lord Denning noted at p. 1081:

The phrase “contempt in the face of the
Court” has a quaint old-fashioned ring about it: but the importance of it, is
this: of all places where law and order must be maintained, it is here, in
these courts. The course of Justice must not be deflected or interfered with.
Those who strike at it, strike at the very foundations of our society. To
maintain law and order, the judges have, and must have, power at once to deal
with those who offend against it. It is a great power—a power instantly to
imprison a person without a trial—but it is a necessary power. So necessary
indeed that until recently the judges exercised it without any appeal.

In In the matter of Lewis Duncan[5], Kerwin C.J., speaking for the
Court, said at p. 43:

The objection taken by Mr. Duncan to
our jurisdiction to cite him for contempt has no foundation. By the provisions
of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 529, this Court is a common
law and equity Court of record and its power to cite and, in proper
circumstances, find a barrister guilty of contempt of Court for words uttered
in its presence is beyond question. That

[Page 75]

power has been exercised for many years and
it is not necessary that steps be taken immediately.

And Kerwin C.J. cited the 3rd edition
of Halsbury, vol.8 (1954), at p. 5:

The power to fine and imprison for a
contempt committed in the face of the Court is a necessary incident to every
court of justice.

The Court was referred to two Canadian cases, in
which the power to impose penalties for contempt of court, namely the refusal
to testify, was admitted even with respect to a witness covered by the Juvenile
Delinquents Act.

The first case is that of Daniel Simard v. M.
le juge Anatole Corriveau et al., No. 200‑38‑000‑003-765,
from the Superior Court of Quebec, decided on October 12, 1976. It concerned an
application for certiorari against a decision of a judge of the Court of
Sessions of the Peace who, acting as a justice and presiding over a preliminary
inquiry, sentenced applicant to seven days in prison for refusing to testify.
Dismissing the application, Roberge J. of the Superior Court said, inter
alia:

[TRANSLATION] AS mentioned above, a judge
at a preliminary inquiry has powers to impose punishment, when necessary, and
it matters little whether the recalcitrant witness is a minor or not; to hold
the contrary would be to decide in favour of chaos in the administration of
justice.

The other case is Re B.[6] from which I reproduce the headnote:

The refusal of a witness to testify after
having been sworn may constitute contempt of Court and a superior Court of
record has inherent power to commit such a person for contempt. Where the
witness is a juvenile the fact that the act of refusing to testify may also constitute
an offence under the Criminal Code  which, pursuant to s. 4 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3, must be tried by a Judge of the
juvenile Court does not abrogate from the superior Court’s jurisdiction, which
is preserved by s. 8  of the Criminal Code , to punish the witness
for contempt and the Judge of the superior Court may so deal with the contempt
if he prefers.

[Page 76]

My conclusion is the same. The judge in the case
at bar had the power to impose a penalty for contempt committed “in the face”
of the Court, namely appellant’s refusal to testify.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Constitutional law—Driving while being
disqualified—Sphere of provincial legislation—National effect to provincial
licence suspension—True object and character of enactment—Whether ultra vires
Parliament—British North America Act, 1867, s. 91(27)—Criminal Code , s. 238(3) .

Criminal law—Conviction for driving while
disqualified—Underlying provincial legislation—Suspension or cancellation by
simple administrative or judicial action—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
s. 238(1), (2), (3) as amended by 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93, s. 19(1), (2),
(3)—The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 202, ss. 13, 20(1), 30, 138(4)—The
Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 281, ss. 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10,
as amended by 1973 (Ont.), c. 13, ss. 3, 4, 6,7.

Appellant was convicted in a Provincial Court for driving an automobile
while impaired contrary to s. 234  of the Criminal Code  and for refusing
to take a breath test, contrary to s. 235 of the Code. His driver’s
licence was automatically suspended by administrative action. Appellant was
thereafter charged with driving an automobile while disqualified by reason of
the suspension of his licence to drive a motor vehicle in the Province of Ontario, contrary to
s. 238(3) of the Code. He was convicted in a Provincial Court which held that s. 238(3) 
was intra vires the Parliament of Canada.

In parallel proceedings in R. v. Akey, [1979]
1 M.V.R. 293, the Provincial Court found s. 238(3) to be ultra vires. On a stated case,
the High Court of Ontario

[Page 50]

reversed that decision. The Court of Appeal
in both proceedings found s. 238(3) intra vires.

This Court granted leave to appeal on the
following question: “Did the Court of Appeal err in law in holding that the
enactment of s. 238(3)  of the Criminal Code  was intra vires of
the Parliament of Canada?”

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and s. 238(3)  held ultra vires.

Section 238(3)  takes on two separate characteristics.
Where the suspension of a driver’s licence results from provincial
administrative action in response to a conviction for an offence under the Criminal
Code , it operates to create a new offence under the Code in addition
to the provincial offence of driving while under disqualification. On the other
hand, the suspension or cancellation can result from provincial administrative
or judicial action under a provincial statute, for reasons such as failure to
pay motor vehicle related civil judgments or to make payments to vehicle
accident compensation funds established by the province, failure to pay any
such civil judgments rendered in other provinces or states of the United
States, violation of the rules of the road as declared by provincial statute or
regulation, and violation of provincial schemes relating to the taxation and
licensing of motor vehicles fuel oil. Section 238(3)  then creates a new
punishment under the Code for breach of a provincial law or regulation
without any distinction in the punishment so applied as between the case where
the initial breach was itself a Code offence and the second case where
the breach relates to a provincial regulation. In those cases, the conduct has
nothing to do with the ability to drive and the safety on highways of the
nation. Presently, the section creates an offence to drive anywhere in Canada during a disqualification of one’s
driver’s licence by any province for any reason related or unrelated to the use
of highways and streets.

Parliament cannot invade the proper sphere of
provincial legislatures by adopting the guise of criminal legislation under s.
91(27) of the B.N.A. Act, the ambit of which has been discussed in this
Court in several cases. As Rand J. said in the Lord’s Day case, [1959]
S.C.R. 497, “…criminal acts are those forbidden by law… enacted to serve what
is considered a public interest or to interdict what is deemed a public harm or
evil”. The community interest in safety on roads attracts a proper exercise of
legislative authority in the field of criminal law. But there is no readily
discernible community interest in the criminalization of the administration of
a

[Page 51]

wholesale or retail licensing system. Section
238(3)  is on this aspect wholly inarticulate and there is nothing to sever so
as to preserve what is constitutionally proper.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

ESTEY J.—In this appeal we are concerned with a
challenge to the constitutionality of s. 238(3)  of the Criminal Code  of
Canada, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34. The case arises out of convictions of the
appellant on August 5, 1977 in
a Provincial Court for driving
an automobile while impaired, contrary to s. 234  of the Criminal Code ; and
for refusing to take a breath test, contrary to s. 235 of the Code. Following
these convictions, the appellant’s driver’s licence was automatically suspended
by administrative action pursuant to s. 20(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O.
1970, c. 202. The

 [Page 52]

appellant was thereafter charged with driving an
automobile on August 11, 1979 while disqualified by reason of the suspension of
his licence to drive a motor vehicle in the Province of
 Ontario, contrary to s. 238(3)
of the Code. In the ensuing proceedings in Provincial
 Court, the appellant was convicted, the Court finding
that s. 238(3)  was intra vires the Parliament of Canada.

The same issue arose in the Ontario courts in parallel proceedings in R.
v. Akey[2] where
Judge Clendenning of the Provincial Court found the Code section to be ultra vires; the High
Court of Ontario, on a stated case, reversed this decision in a judgment by
Montgomery J. The Court of Appeal in both proceedings found s. 238(3)  to be intra
vires and accordingly dismissed the appeal by the appellant Boggs from his
conviction on the merits.

In this Court, leave to appeal was granted in
respect of the following question:

Did the Court of Appeal err in law in
holding that the enactment of ss. 238(3)  of the Criminal Code  was intra
vires of the Parliament of Canada?

Section 238(3)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada provides as follows:

Every one who drives a motor vehicle in Canada while he is disqualified or
prohibited from driving a motor vehicle by reason of the legal suspension or
cancellation, in any province, of his permit or licence or of his right to
secure a permit or licence to drive a motor vehicle in that province is guilty
of

(a) an indictable offence and
is liable to imprisonment for two years; or

(b) an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

The statute was enacted in its present form in
1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93, s.
19(2) when Parliament by s. 19(1) and (3) repealed subss. (1) and (2) and subs.
(3.1) of s. 238 and recast subs. (3) in the form set out above. The repealed
sections empowered the Court on a conviction under speci-

 [Page 53]

fied sections of the Code to prohibit the
accused from driving a motor vehicle for such time (within time limits
stipulated in the subsections) and in such places in Canada as the Court may specify. Subsection (3) has been in the Code since
first enacted in 1938 (Can.),
c. 44, s. 16. While this Code provision (s. 238(3) ) has not come
under direct constitutional attack in this Court, the section has been examined
directly or obliquely in connection with other issues. In Provincial
Secretary of P.E.I. v. Egan[3], this
Court found that the repealed subs. (2) authorizing a court to add suspension
of a driving licence to punishment which might otherwise be imposed on a
conviction for driving while intoxicated or while licence is suspended was intra
vires Parliament. Chief Justice Duff found that such a provision (then
s. 285(7)) was constitutional but he had no occasion to pass upon the then
s. 285(8), which is the present subs. (3) of s. 238. The principal issue
related to the effect of s. 285(7) of the Code (that is the
authorization for the Court to impose suspension in addition to other
penalties) on the continuing validity of a Prince
 Edward Island statute which provided for the automatic
suspension of an accused’s driver’s licence upon a conviction for driving a
motor vehicle while intoxicated. The Court concluded that s. 285(7) left the
provincial statute unaffected. This case is of no assistance here where we have
the opposite issue, namely, is Parliament competent to add a criminal
consequence to a provincial licence suspension whatever the reason for that
suspension.

In R. v. Prue and Baril[4] this Court was concerned with the
requirement of mens rea in the proof of an offence under s. 238(3)  and
the majority of the Court found a requirement for proof of intention. No issue
of constitutionality was raised and the Court made no reference to such a
question either in majority or dissent.

 [Page 54]

The section was again before this Court in R.
v. Mansour[5] where
the issue was whether an offence under this Code provision could be
committed where the driving in question was in a place (there a parking lot)
where no provincial licence was required for the operation of a motor vehicle.
The Court expressly noted that no constitutional issue had been raised by the
parties.

Other courts have considered the
constitutionality of s. 238(3) : R. v. Whynacht[6], and R. v. Munro[7]. In the former case the Court,
relying heavily on the Egan case, supra, found subs. (8) (present
subs. (3)) to be valid federal legislation. At least one member of the Court
concluded that since the then subs. (7), quoted above, was found valid in Egan,
supra, then subs. (8) must be valid as it refers to driving during a
disqualification ordered under subs. (7) as well as to any other type of
suspension. Of course, subs. (7) has since been repealed and so now the only
requirement in the Code section is an outstanding provincial
disqualification. Graham J. considered subs. (8) as though it were in two
parts, the first relating to a court ordered disqualification and the second to
a provincial administrative disqualification. He then lumped the two parts
together and put them both under the umbrella of Egan, supra, stating at
pp. 244-5:

The operation of a motor vehicle on the
highway by a driver who is unfit to drive is potentially dangerous; and the
purpose of both parts of s. 285(8) is the same—viz.:—because of such
danger, to prevent an unfit driver from driving on the highway. The main reason
for requiring a driver to be licensed is to ensure that it is not dangerous to
allow him to drive a motor vehicle; and the inference from revocation of his
licence is that he is not a fit person to drive a motor vehicle and that it
would be dangerous to allow him to drive because the revocation must be
presumed to have been for just cause, and in exercise of a proper discretion,
if there is discretion.

 [Page 55]

Sir Joseph Chisholm C.J., speaking for himself
and four other members of the Court, concluded at p. 241:

Parliament was not acting under a guise or
with an indirect purpose. It was making a genuine attempt to amend the criminal
law and to make provision for repressing a growing evil. Subsection (8) is no
more than a further extension of ss.(7), which has already been held to be intra
vires of Parliament.

The accused there had initially been convicted
of driving while intoxicated.

In the Munro case, supra, the
Manitoba Court of Appeal followed the Whynacht decision and found subs.
(3) to be valid partly on the basis that Parliament alone could give a
provincial suspension national effect. Again, the initial conviction was for
driving while impaired.

Before turning to the test of this Code provision
under s. 91(27) (criminal law) of the British North America Act, R.S.C.
1970, Appendix No. 5, it will be helpful to examine the underlying provincial
legislation both in Ontario, the province of suspension in this case, as well
as in some of the other provinces. This is particularly relevant now that subs.
(7) has been repealed (as subs. (1) of s. 238) and likewise because of the
apparent reliance by earlier courts upon the relationship of the
disqualification under provincial law to conduct on the highway. Under Ontario
legislation, a person’s driver’s licence may be suspended by judicial or
administrative action under two different statutes, including at least 21
provisions, ranging from suspension for non-payment of an obligation to a
statutory accident compensation fund to the failure to pay a fine imposed under
various statutes relating to the operation of commercial vehicles and private
vehicles on the highways. This exposure to disqualification extends, where
there is reciprocal legislation, to like indebtedness arising under statutes of
other provinces and the states of the United States of
 America. It is also important to note that since
liability arises vicariously through the operation by another of the owner’s
vehicle by consent, these provisions likewise result in disqualification of the
owner’s licence for reasons unrelated to his operation or ability to operate

[Page 56]

a motor vehicle on the highways of the province.
These disqualifying provisions are found in The Highway Traffic Act, supra, as
well as in The Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act, R.S.O. 1970, c.
281, ss. 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 10, all as amended by 1973 (Ont.), c. 13, ss. 3, 4,
6 and 7.

It is of interest to note that by s. 20(3) of The
Highway Traffic Act, supra, the province gives to the court hearing charges
under certain sections of the Criminal Code , supra, the same power of
licence suspension as was formely found in subs. (1) of s. 238  (repealed in
1973-74-75 (Can.), c. 93, s. 19(1)).

As already stated, an owner of a motor vehicle
under the Ontario statutes (and
in most of the other provinces as well) may be civilly responsible for damage
caused by his or her vehicle when driven by a person authorized to drive it.
Such liability might result in a judgment in a civil court or an order for
payment to the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund of Ontario or a similar fund
established and maintained in other provinces. Failure to pay or to maintain
instalment payments in either case may result in the suspension of the owner’s
driver’s licence by simple administrative action. This in turn would bring into
play s. 238(3) of the Code if such an owner drives a motor vehicle
during such disqualification. See The Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act, R.S.O.
1970, c. 281, as amended by 1973 (Ont.), c. 13, ss. 2 to 5 and s. 9. The same
result can follow when an accident occurs in another province or in a state of
the United States of America
where legislation “similar in effect” to that of Ontario has been adopted. See The Highway Traffic Act, supra, s.
138(4). The provincial statute also provides for automatic suspension following
conviction under a number of sections of the Code relating to criminal
negligence, driving while impaired by drugs or alcohol; and for the increase of
the period of suspension by judicial discretion.

[Page 57]

Most of these provisions are found in various
forms in the statutes of other provinces and nothing is to be gained here by
their recitation. Without detailing the scope of the provincial employment of
the technique of disqualification from driving, one can illustrate the extent
of the practice in the various provinces by a reference to some legislation in
the Province of Alberta. By s.
57(1) of The Motor Vehicle Registration Act, 1975 (2) (Alta.), c. 68, s.
57, as amended by a series of Alberta statutes, the Minister may “suspend or cancel an operator’s
licence… for contravention of… The Fuel Oil Licensing Act, [R.S.A. 1970,
c. 152], or of The Fuel Oil Tax Act, [R.S.A. 1970, c. 153], or of The
Fuel Oil Administration Act, [1978 (Alta.), c. 16], or the regulations
thereunder”. By subs. (c) of s. 57(1), such disqualification may
be imposed “for any other reason appearing to the Minister to be sufficient”. The
Fuel Oil Licensing Act, supra, provides, for example, for a licensing
system of persons engaged in the wholesale or retail distribution or refining
of oil. The statute creates a number of offences relating to unlicensed
operations, failure to fill out and file any forms prescribed by the Act, or to
make the records of the licensee available to the Minister on demand, the
blending of grades of oil without ministerial permission, the sale of fuel oil
below grades as specified by regulation, and a licensee’s failure “to obey any
lawful requirement or order of the Minister”. There are other offences of like
nature established in the statute, including the usual catch-all offence for
the violation of any provision of the Act or of any regulation thereunder (s.
31). The statute authorizes the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make
regulations in respect of fourteen matters enumerated in the statute, plus a
general authority to make regulations “for the better carrying out of the
provisions of this Act” (s. 33(a)). The Fuel Oil Tax Act,
supra, applies a tax on all fuel oil (any petroleum product used in an
internal combustion engine to generate power, other than natural gas) purchased
or brought in to Alberta. A
system for the collection of the tax is detailed in the statute and offences
are established for the violation of various provisions relating to the marking
of exempt gas, filing of returns, non-payment for gas, etc. Section

[Page 58]

17(5) authorizes a magistrate to prohibit the
accused from driving a motor vehicle for a specified period for offences under
the Act. The Fuel Oil Administration Act, supra, provides, in s. 36,
another taxation system with reference to domestic heating oil, farm fuel oil,
and other fuels; and creates similar offences to those established in the two
statutes already examined. By reason of The Motor Vehicle Registration Act,
supra, s. 57, a breach of any such statutes or regulations thereunder,
including non-payment of a tax assessment, may result in a suspension of
licence, and thus s. 238(3) of the Code would come into play.

At least in the case of the Provinces of
Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, the
province has filled in the gap created by the repeal of subs. (1) of s. 238 in
the 1974-75-76 statutes, supra, by authorizing a court, on the
conviction of an offence under the Code relating to the driving of a
motor vehicle, to suspend or cancel the accused’s driver’s licence. See, for
example, the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, s. 82.

A review of the highway legislation of all the
provinces reveals that generally, provision is made in provincial statutes for
the suspension of driver’s licences upon conviction of offences in the Criminal
Code  related to the operation of motor vehicles; for the failure to pay
motor vehicle related civil judgments, or to make like payments to vehicle
accident compensation funds established by the province; and for failure to pay
any such civil judgments rendered in other provinces or states of the United
States with like legislation; for violation of the rules of the road as declared
by provincial statute or regulation; and for the violation of provincial
schemes relating to the taxation and licensing of motor vehicles, fuel oil,
etc. The employment of the device of administrative and judicial
disqualification of the driver’s licence by the provinces has apparently come a
long way

[Page 59]

since the days of Whynacht, supra, where
Graham J. noted that the purpose of the reference in s. 238(3)  (then 285(8)),
was (and I repeat it for emphasis):

…to prevent an unfit driver from driving on
the highway… and the inference from revocation of his licence is that he is not
a fit person to drive a motor vehicle and that it would be dangerous to allow
him to drive because the revocation must be presumed to have been for just
cause… (at p. 245)

It is obvious that a suspension of an owner’s
licence for the non-payment of a judgment arising out of the driving of an
authorized driver, or suspension or revocation by reason of the non-payment of
a fuel oil bill relating to domestic heating oil, have no relationship in
practice or in theory to the owner’s ability to drive and hence to public
safety on the highways of the nation.

The effect of s. 238(3)  takes on two separate
characteristics. Where the suspension of a driver’s licence results from
provincial administrative action in response to a conviction for an offence
under the Criminal Code , supra, s. 238(3) , it operates to create a new
offence under the Code in addition to the provincial offence of driving
while under disqualification. See the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, supra, ss. 13 and 30, or
similar legislation in British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, s. 12(1)(a). Where, however, the
suspension or cancellation results from provincial administrative action, as
for example under the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, supra, s. 138, or by
judicial action under a provincial statute, as for example the Alberta
legislation, supra, s. 238(3)  creates a new punishment under the Code
for breach of the provincial law or regulation without any distinction in
the punishment so applied as between the first case, that is where the initial
breach was itself a Code offence, and the second case, where the breach
relates to a provincial regulation. In either case, the offence is complete
only after the introductory action taken by a provincial authority (or a court)
under a provincial statute, and the breach of the provincially-ordained
suspension, which breach, by s. 238(3) , constitutes an offence under

[Page 60]

the Code. This Court, in considering this
aspect of s. 238(3)  in Mansour, supra, said:

Section 234(1) describes the offence
without reference to any provincial statute or licence requirement. All that is
required is that a person have the care and control of a motor vehicle as
defined in the Code while his ability to drive is impaired as likewise
defined in the Code. In ascertaining the width and breadth of the
offence, it is unnecessary to look beyond the Criminal Code . In contrast, s.
238(3)  has no application unless a province has suspended or cancelled the
accused’s licence or permit to drive. (Emphasis added.) (p. 924)

The issue then is reached, can Parliament
validly exercise its criminal power under s. 91(27) by attaching penal
consequences by means of a Criminal Code  provision (here s. 238(3) ) to a
breach of an order made administratively or judicially under a valid provincial
statute, without any necessary relationship to the conduct that led to such an
order?

Parliament cannot, of course, invade the proper
sphere of the provincial legislature by simply adopting the guise or disguise
of criminal legislation under s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act, supra. As
Lord Atkin stated in A.G.B.C. v. A.G. Canada[8], at pp. 375-6:

The only limitation on the plenary power of
the Dominion to determine what shall or shall not be criminal is the condition
that Parliament shall not in the guise of enacting criminal legislation in
truth and in substance encroach on any of the classes of subjects enumerated in
s. 92. It is no objection that it does in fact affect them. If a genuine attempt
to amend the criminal law, it may obviously affect previously existing civil
rights. The object of an amendment of the criminal law as a rule is to deprive
the citizen of the right to do that which, apart from the amendment, he could
lawfully do. No doubt the plenary power given by s. 91(27) does not deprive the
Provinces of their right under s. 92(15) of affixing penal sanctions to their
own competent legislation. On the other hand, there seems to be nothing to
prevent the Dominion, if it thinks fit in the public interest, from

 [Page 61]

applying the criminal law generally to acts
and omissions which so far are only covered by provincial enactments.

See also In re The Board of Commerce Act,
1919[9], at
pp. 198-9 per Viscount Haldane; and Toronto Electric Commissioners v.
Snider et al.[10],
at p. 408 per Viscount Haldane:

It is obvious that these provisions dealt
with civil rights, and it was not within the power of the Dominion Parliament
to make this otherwise by imposing merely ancilary penalties. The penalties for
breach of the restrictions did not render the statute the less an interference
with civil rights in its pith and substance. The Act is not one which aims at
making striking generally a new crime.

It is to be observed at once that here we have a
situation wherein the province does not seek to subject the citizen to a
quasi-penal punishment in the sense that the fine or imprisonment or other
disadvantage is scaled to the nature of the offence, but rather, at least in
the case where administrative action is taken in response to the non-payment of
a provincial tax or fee under a provincial regulatory scheme, the imposition of
the suspension is directed towards compelling payment of the fee rather than
punishing an offence. Thus, we have the situation described in the opening
sentence of the above excerpt from the judgment of Viscount Haldane. Here, the
Dominion is criminalizing an action which may have been prohibited by the
province only as a coercive measure to bring about the operation of a provincial
plan, be it taxation or regulation.

The ambit of subs. (27) of s. 91 was discussed
in this Court in a succession of three cases: Re Dairy Industry Act
(Margarine Reference)[11];
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company of Canada Limited v. The Queen[12] and Lord’s Day Alliance v. A.G.B.C

 [Page 62]

et al.[13] The meaning of “criminal law” in subs. (27) assumes great importance
because of the overriding interpretative requirement of construing the whole of
ss. 91 and 92 so as to determine the balances and watersheds of jurisdiction of
the plenary spheres of legislative authority in a federal union. Rand J.
considered this as his starting point in the Lord’s Day case, supra, at
pp. 508-9:

Undoubtedly criminal acts are those
forbidden by law, ordinarily at least if not necessarily accompanied by penal
sanctions, enacted to serve what is considered a public interest or to
interdict what is deemed a public harm or evil. In a unitary state the
expression would seem appropriate to most if not all such prohibitions; but in
a federal system distinctions must be made arising from the true object,
purpose, nature or character of each particular enactment.

In the Margarine case, supra, the
Court was determining the true nature and character under the legislative
allocation provisions of ss. 91 and 92 of the federally-imposed ban on the
production and sale of margarine. Rand J., speaking for the Court, at p. 50
stated:

Is the prohibition then enacted with a view
to a public purpose which can support it as being in relation to criminal law?
Public peace, order, security, health, morality: these are the ordinary though
not exclusive ends served by that law, but they do not appear to be the object
of the parliamentary action here

…

The public interest in this regulation lies
obviously in the trade effects: it is annexed to the legislative subject matter
and follows the latter in its allocation to the one or other legislature. But
to use it as a support for the legislation in the aspect of criminal law would
mean that the Dominion under its authority in that field, by forbidding the
manufacture or sale of particular products, could, in what it considered a
sound trade policy, not only interdict a substantial part of the economic life
of one section of Canada but do so for the benefit of that of another. Whatever
the scope of the regulation of inter‑provincial trade, it is hard to
conceive a more insidious form of encroachment on a complementary jurisdiction.

 [Page 63]

This Court found such an enactment could not be
supported by the criminal law head. In the Goodyear case, supra, Rand
J. restated the test at p. 312, and then, referring to the then Code s.
498 (conspiracy to unduly lessen competition), applied the test at p. 313:

Here it is whether the purpose and object
are to provide additional means for suppressing a public evil of the order of
those recognizable by Parliament under head 27.

The recitation of such a general test is easier
than is its application. As has been said in Prue and Baril, supra, it
is not enough for Parliament “to add a sanction, without more, to a violation
of a provincial penal statute” (per Laskin C.J.C. at p. 552); nor is
nation-wide application itself sufficient to pass the test of validity under
head 27 (ibid p. 551); nor is the requirement of mens rea by
itself decisive for such is open to the provinces as well under s. 92(15) of
the B.N.A. Act, supra. The use by Parliament of the general offence
section (s. 115) of the Code to make criminal the breach of all federal
edicts was likewise found wanting by the Chief Justice in MacDonald and
Railquip Enterprises v. Vapour Canada[14] at pp. 145-6:

Assuming that s. 7(e) (as,
indeed, the other subparagraphs of s. 7) proscribes anti-social business
practices, and are thus enforceable under the general criminal sanction of
s. 115  of the Criminal Code  respecting disobedience of a federal
statute, the attempt to mount the civil remedy of s. 53  of the Trade Marks
Act  on the back of the Criminal Code  proves too much, certainly in
this case. The principle which would arise from such a result would provide an
easy passage to valid federal legislation to provide and govern civil relief in
respect of numerous sections of the Criminal Code  and would, in light of
the wide scope of the federal criminal law power, debilitate provincial
legislative authority and the jurisdiction of provincial Courts so as to
transform our constitutional arrangements on legislative power beyond
recognition.

This brings us back to the test in the Margarine
case, supra, and to the real purpose of s. 238(3) of the Code.
This Court found in Mansour, supra, at p. 925:

 [Page 64]

One of the apparent purposes, if not the
principal purpose, behind s. 238(3)  is to give national effect to provincial
licence suspensions, that is to extend extraterritorially the impact of the provincial
suspension action.

and on the next page:

Another purpose of the subsection might be
the addition of criminal sanctions to the provincial penalty for violations of
the driving suspensions.

There may, of course, be a number of purposes
underlying this Code section. Some may be revealed by the nature of the
provincial suspension provisions which we have already examined. Perhaps others
may be revealed by an examination of the consequences of the application of s.
238 to a provincial action under the revocation authorities. All of this leads
one very far away from the original provincial act of suspension in certain
instances. The root difficulty with the Code provision in its present
form comes more sharply into focus if one were to revise the Mansour circumstances
to include a situation where the driving while under suspension occurred in a
second province (that is a province other than the licensor province) which did
not ordain a suspension in the circumstances which arose in the licensing
province: what is the link to criminality in the conduct of the driver in the
second province; and, more acutely, what is the interest of the latter
community in the condemnation of such a driver by means of criminal
proceedings? What is condemned by Parliament as criminal, and thereby
interdicted, in these circumstances? It cannot be the original conduct in the
licensing province in the example just given for such a standard was not in
effect in the place of the alleged driving offence.

Where a state of the United
 States has adopted “like legislation” recognized by
the licensing province but not by the province in which the offence allegedly
occurred, the element of “public purpose… in relation to criminal law” (in the
words of this Court in the Margarine judgment, supra) is
difficult to discern. The isolation of the purpose of subs. (3) of s. 238
becomes more difficult with the repeal of subs. (1) for a combination of an
order under subs. (1) and driving while a licence is suspended under subs. (3)
had a real relationship to criminal law. Furthermore, if the federal prohi-

[Page 65]

bition were limited to suspensions brought about
by a conviction under specified or unspecified Code provisions, the link
to public order and safety would be more apparent. In its current condition,
the section creates an offence to drive anywhere in Canada during a
disqualification of one’s driver’s licence by any province for any reason
related or unrelated to the use of highways and streets.

The potential complications flowing from this
legislation are as inviting of study as they are unproductive in the search for
the correct constitutional classification of s. 238(3) . One last such example:
if the second province, not recognizing the grounds for suspension invoked in
the first province’s statute, were to issue a licence to the suspended driver,
would the exercise of such licence in a third province with reciprocal
recognition by statute of the licences of each of the first and second
provinces, be an offence under s. 238? Much more to the point is the question:
Can it be a valid exercise of the criminal law interest of Parliament to add
penal consequences to a provincial suspension order directed to the more
efficient administration of a provincial taxation scheme? The difficulty is that
there may be circumstances (some of which have already been indicated) where
the community interest in safety on the road attracts a proper exercise of
legislative authority in the field of criminal law. Especially true is the
opposite proposition, namely that there can be no readily discernible community
interest in the criminalization of the administration of a wholesale or retail
licensing system. Unfortunately, s. 238 is, on this aspect, wholly
inarticulate. There is nothing to sever so as to preserve that which may be
constitutionally proper. Nor can the principle of “reading down” be applied as
this would entail a scrutiny in each trial of the original disqualification
procedure, which may not, as in the Akey case, supra, be before
the Court hearing the charge under s. 238(3) .

[Page 66]

This difficulty was recognized by Turcotte
D.C.J. in R. v. Gaehring[15],
at pp. 191-2 (decided when subs. (1) was still in s. 238) where he observed
that driving during the period of suspension of licence ordered by a court as
part of the punishment for an offence against a Code provision or a
provincial statute was a serious matter and “amounts to a contempt of the
decision of the Court”. Later in the judgment the judge observed:

On the other hand, if it had been proved before
me that this was a suspension as a result of a failure to provide proof of
financial responsibility, perhaps I would have taken a different view of the
matter. (at p. 192)

Unfortunately, the Code makes no such
distinction, and as a practical matter, the trial judge will not always be able
to discern the type of conduct which underlay the provincial suspension.

The appellant makes the further submission that
s. 238(3)  must fall as being an unconstitutional interdelegation of legislative
authority by Parliament to the provincial legislature. This is an analysis
which asserts that Parliament has authorized the provincial legislature to
establish any scheme for disqualification of licence certain in the knowledge
that, by an ever-present piggy-back device, the violation of the provincial
suspension will be an offence under the Criminal Code . The submission
may be attractive, but on the view I take of the proper reach of the criminal
power under subs. (27) of s. 91 , it is not necessary to determine this issue.

I therefore conclude that s. 238(3)  is ultra
vires Parliament and the appeal should be allowed and the conviction of the
appellant set aside.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law — Warrant to seize firearms — Owner
of land refusing entry to police officers — Warrant to seize not including
right to search — Criminal Code , s. 105(1) , 618(2) (a) — Interpretation Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, s. 26(2).

The appellant was charged with five counts
including two counts of attempted murder and two counts of intending to cause
bodily harm, all of which arose out of his conduct in defence of his property,
which the City of Prince Rupert had instructed to be demolished, against what
he deemed to be a wrongful intrusion of police officers acting under the
purported authority of a warrant to seize firearms issued under s. 105(1)  of
the Criminal Code .

A verdict of acquittal was entered on behalf
of appellant at a trial held before a judge and a jury in view of the trial
judge's ruling that a warrant to seize did not give police officers a right to
search.

The British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed
the appeal and directed a new trial.

Hence, the appeal to this Court on the
following questions of law: 1. That the Court of Appeal for British Columbia
erred in law in ruling that the learned trial judge was wrong in holding that a
warrant issued by a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia under s. 105 
of the Criminal Code  did not include the right to enter and search for
the items directed to be seized; 2. that the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia erred in law in holding that the learned trial judge was wrong in
charging the jury and instructing them that at the time of the incidents giving
rise to the charges the police officers involved were trespassers on the
appellant's property; 3. that the Court of Appeal for British Columbia erred in
law in ruling that the learned trial judge was wrong in failing to charge the
jury that at all material times the police officers were in the lawful
execution of their duty.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

[page 3]

What is involved here is a long-standing
right of a citizen of this country to the control of his own property,
including the right to determine who shall and who shall not be permitted to
invade it.

All sections of the Criminal Code  are presumably enacted
""in the public interest"". It would be dangerous to hold that private
rights of the individual to the exclusive enjoyment of his own property are to
be subject to invasion by police officers not armed with express authority to
justify their action. The authority to seize specified in that warrant did not
carry with it the right to enter and search.

Section 26(2) of the Interpretation Act is not applicable to
the circumstances for any provision authorizing police officers to search and
enter private property must be phrased in express terms. Such a power which has
not been expressly conferred cannot be supplied by involving the provisions of
the Interpretation Act.

Semayne's case
(1604), 77 E.R. 194, 5 Co. Rep.
91a; Eccles v. Bourque, [1975]
2 S.C.R. 739, referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1]
allowing an appeal against a verdict of acquittal by a judge and a jury. Appeal
allowed.

Jay Clarke, for
the appellant.

W. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., and M. G. A. Angene, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought pursuant to s. 618(2) (a) of the Criminal
Code  from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia whereby
that Court allowed an appeal by the Crown from a verdict of acquittal entered
on behalf of the appellant at a trial held before Mr. Justice Toy sitting with
a jury.

The appellant had been charged with five counts
including two counts of attempted murder and two counts of intending to cause bodily
harm, all of which arose out of his conduct in defence of his property against
what he deemed to be the wrongful intrusion of police officers acting under the
purported authority of a warrant to seize issued under s. 105(1)  of the Criminal
Code.

[page 4]

The circumstances giving rise to this case are
somewhat startling and are described in those paragraphs of Mr. Justice Toy's
instructions to the jury which are now conveniently reported in [1978] 1 W.W.R.
at p. 673 et seq to which more extensive reference will hereafter be
made. I think it convenient, however, to summarize the background which gave
rise to the appellant's actions which form the substance of the allegations
against him.

In the month of January, 1977, the City Council
of the City of Prince Rupert, B.C., for reasons of its own, instructed
employees in its Public Works Department to ""clean up"" the appellant's
property, including the total destruction of a rudimentary shelter which he
called his home and in which he resided. Not surprisingly the appellant was
much incensed at this prospect and he made it widely known that he would not
let the work crew of the city enter on his property and in fact that he would
defend it by all possible means. In due course members of the R.C.M.P. became
apprehensive that the appellant might use firearms or other offensive weapons
to prevent the city work crew from destroying his habitat and as the event
turned out their fears were not without foundation. After taking legal advice
the R.C.M.P. obtained a warrant under the authority of Mr. Justice Hutcheon who
was acting pursuant to s. 105(1)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada as it
then was which provides that:

105. (1) Where, upon application to a court
made by or on behalf of the Attorney General with respect to any person, the
court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that it is
not desirable, in the interests of the safety of that person or of other
persons, that person should own or have in his possession, custody or control a
firearm or other offensive weapon or any ammunition or explosive substance, the
court may issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of any firearm or other
offensive weapon or any ammunition or explosive substance owned by or in the
possession, custody or control of that person.

The warrant granted by Mr. Justice Hutcheon read
as follows:

WHEREAS it appears on
the oaths of Sgt. Gordon McDougal, Leslie Jensen, Sgt. R. E. Fairhurst, Leslie
Yates, and J. C. Ewart, that there are reasonable

[page 5]

grounds for believing that it is not
desirable, in the interests of the safety of Franz Giacomelli Colet or of other
persons, that Franz Giacomelli Colet should own or have in his possession,
custody or control, a firearm or other offensive weapons or any ammunition or
explosive substances;

You are hereby commanded to seize any
firearms or other offensive weapons or any ammunition or explosive substance
owned by or in the possession, custody or control of Franz Giacomelli Colet.
(The italics are my own).

Armed with this warrant
the R.C.M.P. approached the home of the appellant with a view
to searching the premises for firearms or other offensive weapons or explosive
substances. The appellant adhered to the view that the police were without
authority to search his home and he mounted the roof from which he threw some
gasoline at the policemen and otherwise indicated his determination to defend
his property.

In the course of his
instructions to the jury at the trial of the appellant, Mr. Justice Toy made
the ruling to which I have referred and which is more fully reproduced in the
Western Weekly Reports at pp. 673 to 675 to the following effect:

I don't want to keep you unduly; on the other
hand, I promised you I would give you oral reasons for the ruling that I
pre-emptorily made several days ago. I ruled, without giving any reasons, on
23rd November 1977, that the warrant to seize, granted by my brother Hutcheon,
pursuant to s. 105(1) of the Canadian Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, did
not authorize the peace officers in possession of that warrant to enter and
search the accused's property. The senior peace officer, a sergeant of the
R.C.M.P. of Prince Rupert, had solicited the advice of a solicitor retained by
an agent of the Attorney General of the province, and I was satisfied that the
warrant in question had been obtained on proper grounds.

The learned trial judge's
reasons are more fully expressed at pp. 674 and 675 of the report:

The warrant of seizure was, as s. 105(1) 
anticipates, granted on an ex parte basis. Although the warrant was waved at
the accused from a distance he was told that it was a warrant of the Supreme
Court of British Columbia. The sergeant later told the accused it was a warrant
to search—and I italicize the word ""search""—

[page 6]

for firearms, weapons, ammunition and
explosive substances.

I concluded, after anxious consideration,
that the warrant. granted pursuant to s. 105  did not authorize an entry onto
the accused's lands, nor did it authorize the peace officers to search the
accused's lands in the absence of his licence or permission. My reasons for so
holding are as follows:

1. The plain meaning of ""to seize""
does not, by definition or implication, indicate to me a power to enter or to
search.

2. The special procedures in Pt. XIII of the
Criminal Code —specifically ss. 443  and 447 —refer to seizing and searching,
which suggests to me one does not necessarily include the other, nor are they
synonymous.

3. Other sections of
the Criminal Code  that recognize the distinction between searching and seizing
can be found in ss. 353(1)  and 181 .

4. In the 1968-69 session of the Parliament
of Canada, the gun control legislation was substantially altered. At that time,
the present s. 105  was introduced as a new concept; namely, a procedure to
remove from the citizen any weapons he otherwise lawfully possessed on the
grounds that such removal was for his or others' safety: see 1968-69, c. 38, s.
98o.

At the same time, Parliament and presumably
the legislative draftsmen amended the search and seizure authority section of
the Code where such authority is given without a warrant if, on reasonable and
probable grounds, a peace officer believes that an offence is being or has been
committed. Here see former s. 96(1), 1953-54, c. 51, and the amended version,
1968-69, c. 38 98E(1).

It seems to me that Parliament, if it had
intended that the peace officers authorized to seize were to have the
extraordinary powers to search dwelling houses, property and/or persons, such
powers would have been spelled out with particularity at the same time such as
they were in s. 96(1), 1968-69, c. 38.

5. It seems to me on principle that, if a
citizen is to have his rights or freedoms restricted or impaired, the
legislation should clearly delineate the impairment, and restrictive rather
than a broad interpretation should be placed on such legislation.

[page 7]

The verdict of the jury
acquitting the appellant on all counts was delivered in light of these
instructions and the appeal to the Court of Appeal was limited to the following
questions of law:

1. THAT the learned
trial Judge erred in law in ruling that a warrant issued by a Judge of the
Supreme Court of British Columbia under Section 105 of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, Chapter C34 and amendments thereto did not include the right to
enter and search for the items directed to be seized;

2. THAT the learned
trial Judge erred in law in charging the jury and instructing them that at the
time of the incidents giving rise to the charges the police officers were
trespassers on the property;

3. THAT the learned
trial Judge erred in law in failing to charge the jury that at all material
times the police officers were in the lawful execution of their duty;

4. UPON such further
and other grounds as Counsel may advise.

In due course Mr.
Justice Craig delivered the judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in
which he concluded that

In order to give effect to the intent of s.
105(1)  we should hold that authority to seize an offensive weapon (or any other
article referred to in the subsection) includes the right to search for the
article and includes the right to enter on a person's property to make the
search. Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, and
direct a new trial.

The reasons for
judgment of Mr. Justice Craig are now fully reported in 46 C.C.C. (2d) p. 243
and it is from the judgment rendered in conformity with these reasons that the
appellant now appeals on the following three questions of law:

1. THAT the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia erred in law in ruling that the learned trial Judge
was wrong in holding that a warrant issued by a Judge of the Supreme Court of
British Columbia under Section 105  of the Criminal Code  did not include the
right to enter and search for the items directed to be seized;

2. THAT the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia erred in law in holding that the learned trial
Judge was wrong in charging the jury and instructing them that at the

[page 8]

time of the incidents giving rise to the
charges the police officers involved were trespassers on the Appellant's
property;

3. THAT the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia erred in law in ruling that the learned trial Judge was wrong in
failing to charge the jury that at all material times the police officers were
in the lawful execution of their duty.

In the final analysis this appeal raises the all
important question of whether the property rights of the individual can be
invaded otherwise than with specific statutory authority. It is true that the
appellant's place of residence was nothing more than a shack or shelter which
no doubt was considered inappropriate by the City of Prince Rupert, but what is
involved here is the longstanding right of a citizen of this country to the
control and enjoyment of his own property, including the right to determine who
shall and who shall not be permitted to invade it. The common law principle has
been firmly engrafted in our law since Semayne's case[2] in 1604 where it was said ""That the
house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his
defence against injury and violence, as for his repose ..."". This famous
dictum was cited by my brother Dickson in the case of Eccles v. Bourque[3] in which he made an
extensive review of many of the relevant authorities. He was there dealing with
a case of police officers entering private property for the purpose of
effecting an arrest and in so doing he made reference to the limitation of the
extent of the general application of Semayne's case at p. 743 saying:

But there are occasions when the interest of
a private individual in the security of his house must yield to the public
interest, when the public at large has an interest in the process to be
executed. The criminal is not immune from arrest in his own home nor in the home of one of his friends.

And later on the same page he observed:

Thus it will be seen that the broad basic
principle of sanctity of the home is subject to the exception that upon proper
demand the officials of the King may break down doors to arrest.

The italics in the last two quotations are my
own.

[page 9]

This makes it clear that Mr. Justice Dickson was
limiting his remarks to occasions when the house of the individual is entered
against his will by police officers in search of a fugitive from justice whose arrest
they consider to be justified.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in the
present case, Mr. Justice Craig appears to have treated the judgment in Eccles
v. Bourque as supporting the contention that under all the circumstances

It is legislation in the public interest.
This interest is paramount; the rights of the individual are secondary. Surely,
then, the right to seize any of the things mentioned in the subsection must
include the right to search for any of these things.

With the greatest respect for the Court of
Appeal, I do not consider the Eccles case to afford authority for any
such proposition. All sections of the Criminal Code  are presumably
enacted ""in the public interest"" and it would in my view be dangerous
indeed to hold that the private rights of the individual to the exclusive
enjoyment of his own property are to be subject to invasion by police officers
whenever they can be said to be acting in the furtherance of the enforcement of
any section of the Criminal Code  although they are not armed with
express authority to justify their action.

In the very complete analysis of the cases
contained in the judgment of Mr. Justice Dickson, it is noted that whatever the
occasion may be the police are not justified in making an entry unless they
have first announced their presence and demonstrated their authority by stating
a lawful reason for their entry.

In the present case it is to be observed that
although the police officers waved the warrant at the appellant from a
distance, it was not a warrant ""to search the premises"" nor in my
view did the authority to seize specified in that warrant carry with it the
right to enter and search.

In support of the contention that the authority
to seize included authority to search, the respondent drew attention to the
provisions of s. 26 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970 c. I-23, and
in so doing contended that the power to search was a

[page 10]

necessary ingredient of the power ""to
seize"". Section 26(2) of the Interpretation Act reads as follows:

(2) Where power is given to a person, officer
or functionary, to do or enforce the doing of any act or thing, all such powers
shall be deemed to be also given as are necessary to enable the person, officer
or functionary to do or enforce the doing of the act or thing.

As I have indicated, I am of the opinion that
any statutory provision authorizing police officers to invade the property of
others without invitation or permission would be an encroachment on the common
law rights of the property owner and in case of any ambiguity would be subject
to a strict construction in favour of the common law rights of the owner. This
is made plain from the following excerpt from Maxwell on Interpretation of
Statutes, 12th ed., at p. 251 where it is said:

Statutes which encroach on the rights of the
subject, whether as regards person or property, are subject to a strict
construction in the same way as penal Acts. It is a recognised rule that they
should be interpreted, if possible, so as to respect such rights, and if there is any ambiguity the construction which is
in favour of the freedom of the individual should be adopted.

It appears to me to follow than any provision
authorizing police officers to search and enter private property must be
phrased in express terms and the provisions of the Interpretation Act are
not to be considered as clothing police officers by implication with authority
to search when s. 105(1)  and the warrant issued pursuant thereto are limited to
seizure. The extensive number of sections of the Criminal Code  to which
reference was made by the trial judge and which expressly include the dual
authority ""to search"" and ""to seize"" are enough in
themselves to indicate that the deeming provisions of s. 26(2) of the Interpretation
Act are not applicable to the circumstances.

I am satisfied to adopt the reasoning of Mr.
Justice Toy and I share his view that a wide distinction exists between the
meaning of ""to seize"" and that of ""to search"". As Mr.
Justice Toy has pointed out, it is demonstrable that when Parliament sought to
include the right to search in

[page 11]

providing for the authority to seize, it did so
in specific terms and in this regard I adopt the citation of the various
sections of the Criminal Code  to which reference is made in the above
quoted excerpt from the charge to the jury of the learned trial judge. It is my
respectful opinion that if Parliament intended to include the power ""to
search"" in the provisions of s. 105(1) , the failure to do so was a clear
case of legislative oversight, but that power which has not been expressly
conferred cannot be supplied by invoking the provisions of the Interpretation
Act.

In the result, I am of opinion that the police
officers were acting without authority in attempting to enter and search the
appellant's property and they were therefore trespassers.

For all these reasons I would allow this appeal,
set aside the judgment rendered by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia and
restore the verdict of acquittal entered at trial. 

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ALBERTA

Criminal law—Evidence—Charge of illegally
importing heroin—Doubt as to the nature of the substance—Details of preparation
of standard graph unknown by analyst—“Evidence to the contrary” disproved the
effect of analyst’s certificate—Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1,
ss. 5,9—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 as amended, s. 237.

Appeal—Crowns appeal from acquittal limited
to questions of law—Trial judge’s determination as to what procedure the
analyst followed is one of fact—Trial judge’s determination must
prevail—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 605(1)(a).

Appellants were acquitted of illegally
importing a narcotic. The trial judge was not satisfied that the known standard
graph on which the whole analysis was based was prepared properly and, as a
result, he had some doubt as to the nature of the substance alleged to be
heroin. The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and ordered a new trial.

Held: The
appeals should be allowed.

There was evidence upon which the trial judge
could in law entertain a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the suspect
substance. Though a certificate of analysis does create a presumption, the
words “evidence to the contrary” in s. 9 of the Narcotic Control Act should
not be construed so as to confer upon an analyst’s assertions in a certificate
any ultimately greater probative value than when those same assertions are
adduced under oath in court. “Evidence to the contrary” is any evidence which
tends to put in doubt the probative value Parliament has legislatively
conferred upon statements contained in a s. 9 certificate.

APPEALS from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal of Alberta allowing the
Crown’s appeal from the acquittal of the appellants on a charge of importing a
narcotic. Appeals allowed.

Peter B. Gunn, for the appellant Scott D.
Oliver.

Alex Pringle, for the appellant Kirt H.
Oliver.

P.G. Lister, for the appellant William
Henderson.

J.A. Scollin, Q.C., and S.R. Fainstein,
for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—The appellants were charged with, tried
jointly and were acquitted of unlawfully importing a narcotic contrary to
s. 5(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-l, in the
District Court of Alberta, in Edmonton.

The Crown’s appeal of the acquittal to the
Alberta Court of Appeal was allowed (Clement and Prowse JJ.A., Moir J.A., dissenting)
and a new trial ordered.

The three accused are now before this Court as
of right pursuant to the provision of s. 618(2) (a) of the Criminal
Code  of Canada. At trial
the Crown filed certificates of analysis, pursuant to s. 9(1) of the Narcotic
Control Act:

9. (1)
Subject to this section, a certificate of an analyst stating that he has
analyzed or examined a substance and stating the result of his analysis or
examination is admissible in evidence in any prosecution for an offence
mentioned in subsection 7(1), and in the absence of evidence to the
contrary is proof of the statements contained in the certificate without proof
of the signature or the official character of the person appearing to have
signed the certificate.

It will suffice to reproduce here one of the
certificates, the others being essentially identical, any variations being of
no relevance when considering the issues raised by these appeals:

CERTIFICATE
OF ANALYSIS

I, Anthony Paul Sellar of the city of Edmonton in the Province of Alberta, being a person designated as an analyst by the Governor
in Council for the purpose of the Narcotic Control Act, being Chapter N-l of
the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970, as amended, DO HEREBY CERTIFY:

THAT, on the 28th day of January 1977, at Edmonton in the Province
 of Alberta there was produced
to me by Corporal R.J. Williams, Edmonton, Alberta, one sealed brown envelope containing one plastic bag
containing a second plastic bag containing a white powder which bore the
following markings:

(a) On the said envelope:

“RJW

27-1-77

A”

THAT I marked the said envelope:

“APS 77E-566               Jan 28/77”

THAT I performed a chemical analysis on
white powder contained inside the said inner plastic bag, and found it to
contain Diacetylmorphine (heroin).

I FURTHER CERTIFY that this Certificate of
Analysis is true to the best of my skill and knowledge.

Dated this 16th
day of February 1977 at Edmonton in the Province of
Alberta.


 
  
  LAB. FILE NO. 77E-566
  
  
  (signed) A.P. Sellar
  ANALYST
  
 


The appellants with leave of the trial court
cross-examined the analyst. He described the procedure that is generally
followed, which comprises five steps, in the following terms:

The combined effect of the first three
tests was to narrow the identity of the substance but, even taken collectively,
they do not result in a specific test for heroin; and the fourth test is used
to quantify the amount of the suspect substance, and only the fifth test was
specific to the substance analysed; as regards the fifth test, the substance is
placed in a machine which produces a graph.

[Page 243]

What is then done, once this graph is obtained,
was described by the analyst as follows:

Q. Well, I presume when you get a graph out
of that machine, you in fact compare it to another graph from what you would
call a known standard, is that correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And that known standard graph is
obtained where?

A. The samples of material that we use as
standards, are provided to us by the Health Protection Branch in Ottawa, and tests are run on these
particular samples to refer the graphs obtained with literature values to prove
their authenticity.

Then, as regards the procedure followed in the
present case once the graph was obtained, he testified as follows:

Q. Did you do an analysis of the standard
of the graph of which you compared to these?

A. At that time I did not run a standard,
no, not on the infrared test.

Q. To be clear, when you were given, or
obtained, in either case, the graph, the four graphs resulting from the four
infrared tests done in this case, what precisely did you do with them?

A. I compared them to a graph of heroin
that was done prior, of the heroin standard, pardon me, obtained from Ottawa.

Q. Who did that analysis, do you know?

A. No, sir.

Q. You don’t know when it was done?

A. Well, it is done periodically, any time
a new batch comes in. I believe the standard samples, or standard graphs that
are used right now have been run by myself.

Q. Right now?

A. The ones they are using now, yes, sir.

Q. But at this time you don’t know who it
was?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you compare it to anything else? A.
Not at that time, no.

(My underlining.)

[Page 244]

The description by the analyst of the procedure
usually followed is, to me, clear. There is however some ambiguity as to the
procedure in the present case when one considers the passage of the analyst’s
testimony which I have underlined. Indeed one could read that passage, as we
will see did the Court of Appeal, as indicating that what he compared the graph
to was a graph done on heroin in Ottawa and then sent by Ottawa to his
laboratory in Edmonton, and not, as the usual procedure he described, to a
graph prepared in his laboratory in Edmonton on heroin obtained from Ottawa.

The trial judge, in his reasons, said:

In this case we don’t know anything about
the substance that was sent from Ottawa, nor do we know who prepared that standard chart in Edmonton.

…

The Court I think is entitled to look at
the expertise of the analyst and to determine whether or not he in fact
performed his duties properly and that as a result of the tests which he
performed, whether his opinion is correct. Here I think the weakness in the
analysis is in that chart to which the analyst compared the chart from the
substance before the Court. We know nothing about that chart. The witness did
not prepare it, nor did he apparently know who prepared it.

On the basis of that chart I’m satisfied
that the substance is heroin, but the difficulty I have is whether that
original chart was one in fact of heroin and who prepared it and other matters
relating to proof of that standard chart.

The whole analysis, as I understand the
evidence of the analyst, is based upon that standard chart. If that standard
chart is not correct in any way, then obviously the results of the tests are
faulty. Here I’m not suggesting for a moment that the standard chart was
faulty, but what I am saying is that without proof of somebody having prepared
that from the known substance being produced before the Court, then that
standard chart has not been satisfactorily proven before me.

…

The result is that I come to the conclusion
that I have some doubt as to the nature of the substance, and as such the
accused are entitled to be acquitted.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned ambiguity as
to the procedure actually followed, which in my

[Page 245]

opinion is very slight when one reads the
passage in context, a reading of the trial judge’s reasons indicates that the
trial judge resolved the problem, if any, by making two determinations of fact:
one as regards the procedure usually followed in that laboratory, and one as
regards the procedure followed in the present case.

As determined by the trial judge, the procedure
usually followed by the analyst is that the substance obtained from the Health
Protection Branch in Ottawa, and which is expected to be heroin, is run through
the laboratory’s infrared spectrophotometric machine to obtain a graph which is
then compared to known acceptable “literature values” in order to ascertain
that the substance received from Ottawa was in fact heroin and, if so, to then
have a working standard graph from the machine. Once a standard graph is so
obtained, the graphs of suspect substances are then compared to this standard
for the purpose of ascertaining whether the suspect substance is or is not
heroin.

As regards the present case, the judge
determined that what the analyst compared the graph to was a graph the analyst
assumed had been prepared in Edmonton in the usual manner on heroin obtained
from Ottawa, and not, as could have well been the trial judge’s finding when
considering part of the analyst’s testimony, to a graph obtained from Ottawa.

Also, as the witness had not prepared nor had he
overseen the preparation of the standard graph nor did he even know who had
done so, all he could testify to, as a result, was that the graph of the
suspect substance indicated that it was heroin but only if and to the extent
the substance used to prepare the standard graph was itself heroin, a factual prerequisite
he could not personally affirm.

The reliability of the fifth test having been
put in some doubt, there was an attempt on the part of the Crown in the course
of a re-examination to have the expert establish the presence of heroin through
the first four tests:

[Page 246]

Q. Now we have gone into a lot of
similarities, and ups and downs and waves and all the rest of it. I don’t
really follow it too much, I just got a B.A. Maybe you can explain to us all,
like myself, and I may be the only one here that doesn’t understand it, so
perhaps you can explain how you came to the conclusion that it was
diacetylmorphine heroin?

A. By the performance of the tests done.

Q. Well, how did all the tests relate
together, can you explain that?

A. Well, when you start off with a Marquis
Test, the colour test, if you have a purplish colour, it generally indicates
that an opiate may be present, not exclusively, but there would be an opiate
suggested.

The second test would be to run an
ultra-violet spectrophotometric test. In this particular instance with all four
exhibits I did not get a U.V., or ultraviolet scan consistent with heroin. It
was more consistent with caffeine. Because of the presence of caffeine that was
indicated, I then had to isolate the heroin from the compound, and identify it
separate from the caffeine.

Q. So what did you do?

A. This is when I did a column
chromatographic procedure, where I would separate basic drugs, such as heroin,
from neutral drugs, such as caffeine. The basic extract was then examined by
infrared spectrophotometry.

Q. And from your performance of the
test—how often had you used this infrared test before?

A. How many times have I used it?

Q. Yes?

A. I believe that model has been there most
of the time that I have been using infrared, so maybe a couple of years that
that particular model of instrument would be there. So it would be 50 to 100
times both with respect to heroin and with respect to other drugs.

Q. Did you have any difficulty in
interpreting the charts that you obtained?

A. Not with these particular ones, no, sir.

And later on said:

Q. Did you do that with the samples you
have before the Court today?

A. I did compare them to the standard
spectrum, yes.

Q. In your opinion what is the drugs we
have here?

A. Diacetylmorphine heroin was indicated in
all four exhibits.

[Page 247]

Q. Did you have any difficulty coming to
that conclusion?

A. No, sir. Infrared is used by our
laboratory as a confirmation test, but because of the other tests that were
performed prior to the infrared, we have a very great indication that heroin is
indeed present, and we expect it to react the way it did.

Q. So there was no surprise.

A. No, sir.

At best, the conclusion that could be drawn from
the first four tests is the strong probability of the presence of “basic
drugs”, but which could only be said to be heroin once subjected to infrared
spectrophotometry. In passing it should be noted that there was no attempt on
the part of the Crown to obtain an adjournment for the purpose of perfecting
the infrared spectrophotometric test done on the suspect substance which was
being challenged. The Crown, as was its right, preferred relying on the
certificate and to argue a limited interpretation as to what may constitute
“evidence to the contrary”.

In the Court of Appeal all three judges
predicated their opinion on the assumption that what the analyst in Edmonton
compared the graphs of suspect material to was a graph of heroin prepared in
Ottawa. Prowse J.A. then said:

I see no reason why a reference standard
prepared by the Department designated by the Parliament of Canada to administer
the relevant legislation relating to drugs and narcotics should not be accepted
by the Courts, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as a proper
reference standard for determining the nature of a substance falling within
such acts. No attack was made on the standard and no evidence was adduced which
would raise a doubt as to its accuracy. In fact, as soon as the defence
inadvertently strayed into an area where the analyst was about to point out the
difference between a heroin and cocaine chart the questioning abruptly changed
course.

He then concluded that the appeal should be
allowed and a new trial ordered.

Moir J.A. took the view that the Crown was
relying on hearsay:

…as the control graph was made up by some
unknown person in some unidentified department in Ottawa using some
unidentified substance…

and would have dismissed the appeal.

[Page 248]

Clement J.A. dealt with the issue as follows:

No evidence was tendered that the substance
was not heroin or other narcotic falling within the indictment. What must be
examined is the evidence of Sellar to determine whether it can sustain a
reasonable doubt on the accuracy of the prima facie case: that is to
say, did it sufficiently rebut the fact of which the certificate was prima
facie proof, namely that the substance with which the respondents were
charged with importing was a narcotic, viz. heroin.

He then analysed the evidence and concluded:

In the end, Sellar affirmed his conclusion
that the substance he analyzed contained heroin. I find nothing in the evidence
which could support a reasonable doubt on this conclusion. I would allow the
appeal and vacate the acquittal.

I am in agreement with Mr. Justice
Prowse that a new trial must be ordered.

With deference, I do not think that the issue
dealt with by Prowse and Moir JJ.A. in the Court of Appeal arises. Indeed, as
this was an appeal to their Court by the Crown, the issues of law that could be
considered were those that arose from the facts as they had been determined by
the trial judge. The determination as to what procedure the analyst followed is
one of fact and can only be set aside pursuant to an appeal by the Crown when,
as a matter of law, there is no evidence upon which the determination arrived
at could reasonably have been predicated.

Such is not the present case.

As said earlier, the trial judge determined that
the analyst compared his graph to a graph he the analyst assumed had been
prepared in his laboratory; the judges in the Court of Appeal, either because
they thought the trial judge had determined otherwise or because they made
their own determination on that point of fact, dealt with the appeal as if the
analyst had compared his graph of the suspect substance to a graph sent to his
laboratory by Ottawa. The trial judge’s determination, whether we agree with it
or not (and with which in passing I might say I agree), must prevail, as the

[Page 249]

Court of Appeal was, on an appeal by the Crown
from an acquittal, limited to entertaining questions of law alone (s. 605(1)(a)).

As a result the question whether an analyst need
verify a standard of some official character furnished by the government in
Ottawa before relying on it to draw a conclusion with respect to suspect substances
does not arise; and neither arises the question whether evidence that he did
not so verify the Ottawa graph may or may not be, as a question of law,
“evidence to the contrary”, as those words are meant in s. 9 of the Narcotic
Control Act.

Indeed, as said earlier, the trial judge had
determined that what the analyst compared the graph of the suspect substance to
was not, as assumed by the Court of Appeal, a graph prepared in Ottawa, but was
a graph the analyst assumed had been prepared from a substance received from
Ottawa. Having so determined, the judge, at the trial’s end, had before him
evidence tendered by the analyst that his opinion, as stated both in Court and
in his Certificate, was founded on an assumption on the analyst’s part that the
chart had been prepared by someone qualified, having followed acceptable
procedure and on a substance that was in fact heroin.

The issue before the Court of Appeal was whether
there was some evidence upon which the trial judge could in law entertain, as
he did, a reasonable doubt as to the fact that the suspect substance was
heroin. When considering only the analyst’s opinion evidence given in court, in
my opinion there clearly was.

As the Crown had relied on the presumption
enjoyed by the analyst’s certificate, the only remaining question was whether
evidence of the fact that he predicated his certificate on such an assumption
could be “evidence to the contrary”, as those words are intended in s. 9.I
think so.

“Evidence to the contrary” is any evidence which
tends to put in doubt the probative value Parliament has legislatively
conferred upon the statements contained in a s. 9 certificate. This

[Page 250]

evidence may be in regard to the analyst
himself, his qualifications, integrity, or in regard of the procedures he
followed to draw his conclusions. Section 9 has been enacted to dispense with
the calling of experts to testify in cases where the nature of the suspect
substance is not really in issue. Though, at the outset, a certificate does
create a presumption, the words “evidence to the contrary” should not be
construed so as to confer upon an analyst’s assertions in a certificate any
ultimate greater probative value than when those same assertions are adduced
under oath in court.

“Evidence to the contrary”, as regards an
analyst’s conclusions set out in a certificate, as those words are meant in
s. 9, is any evidence upon which a trier of fact could as a matter of law
rest a reasonable doubt as to that analyst’s conclusions had he testified as an
expert witness in court.

By inserting the words “and in the absence of
evidence to the contrary” in s. 9, Parliament has done no more than spell
out, as regards s. 9 certificate evidence, what is in fact the law as
regards opinion evidence adduced in the traditional way, indeed as regards any
evidence, namely, that a trier of fact cannot arbitrarily set aside lawful
evidence, that is, not unless there is some evidence to the contrary upon which
his so doing may, as a matter of law, be predicated.

We have been invited by respondent to consider
numerous pronouncements. by courts and more particularly by this Court
concerning the meaning of the words “evidence to the contrary” in s. 237 
of the Criminal Code , which deals with the analysis of breath, blood or
urine, of motor vehicle drivers.

Those pronouncements are unfortunately of little
help to us in dealing with what we are concerned with here. True one does see
that at s. 237(1)(c) and (c.1) Parliament has used language
analogous to that of s. 9 of the Narcotic Control Act. However,
Parliament has gone much further and spelt throughout s. 237  the
procedures

[Page 251]

to be followed and the types of approved
instruments to be used when proceeding to the taking of samples and the
analysis thereof.

By enacting s. 237  Parliament has set up,
to use the words of my brother Beetz J., in R. v. Moreau[1], at p. 272, an elaborate
legislative scheme which

…contemplates and provides for elements of
positive certainty such as the official approval of certain kinds of
instruments, the designation of analysts and qualified technicians, a maximum
time period between the commission of the alleged offence and the taking of a
breath sample, and the reading by a qualified technician on an approved
instrument of a proportion of alcohol in the blood in excess of a specified
proportion. Once the conditions prescribed or contemplated by this scheme are
fulfilled, a presumption arises against the alleged offender which he can rebut
by tendering “evidence to the contrary”.

Indeed the scheme contemplates all kinds of
evidentiary short cuts and confers upon various sorts of certificates special
probative value which then is further buttressed by presumptions created by the
different scientific analyses; but these presumptions operate only if the
analyst and other persons involved in the process followed the elaborate
procedures, and used the approved apparatus required under s. 237 . As a
result, what may or may not be “evidence to the contrary” under s. 237  of
the Criminal Code  is to be determined in the light of that elaborate
legislative scheme. Under the Narcotic Control Act the expert is in no
way told how to proceed nor is he told to use specifically approved material in
the exercise of his art, if his conclusions are to enjoy special probative
value. What may or may not be “evidence to the contrary” under one or the other
offence must be determined in the light of that difference. The difference of
approach by Parliament to the evidentiary problems under s. 237  of the Criminal
Code  and crimes under the Narcotic Control Act no doubt reflects a
recognition by Parliament of the disparity as to the seriousness between the
two types of offences and the disparity in the consequences of a conviction
under s. 237  of the Criminal Code  (usually a fine and some curtailment
of one’s driving privileges) and that under s. 5 of the

[Page 252]

Narcotic Control Act which carries a possible term of life imprisonment and, in any
event, a minimum sentence of seven years.

I am therefore of the view that there was, as a
matter of law, “evidence to the contrary”, upon which the trial judge could
entertain a doubt as to the probative value of the certificate’s statement that
the substance was heroin; as a result there was, in my view, when considering
all of the evidence, parol and certificate, some evidence upon which the judge
could have, as he did, a reasonable doubt as to that fact and acquit.

I would allow the appeals of all three
appellants, quash the order for a new trial and restore the acquittals.

or not the reasons of the trial judge were adequate to support the conviction.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally
by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The sole issue raised in this
case is whether the reasons of the trial judge, sitting alone on a drug
trafficking charge, were adequate to support the conviction or whether there
was a reversible error in his failure to advert to the danger of acting on
accomplice evidence unless corroborated. Counsel for the appellant concedes
that if the evidence of the accomplice is accepted the conviction was properly
entered.

We are of the opinion that the trial judge’s
reasons, read in the light of the argument of counsel the day before on the
very point in issue, were sufficient to support the conviction, especially
having regard to his acceptance of the evidence of the accomplice, of which
there was, in fact, corroboration.

The appeal accordingly fails and must be
dismissed.

Judgment accordingly.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal
law—Prostitution—Soliciting—Pressing or persistent conduct essential element of
charge—Encounters observed with several unidentified men before undercover
police officer approached—Whether or not pressing or persistent conduct
established—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 195.1.

Both cases concerned the meaning of the word
“solicit” in s. 195.1  of the Criminal Code . Each respondent
approached several men in public places before offering to prostitute herself
to an undercover police officer. Nothing constituting “persistence” passed
between the respondents and the police officers and no evidence of what
respondents said to the men approached before the police officers was
submitted. At trial, the cumulative effect of the previous approaches was held
to establish the element of persistence inherent in the offence of soliciting
but both the County Court and the Court of Appeal overturned this decision. The
issue here was whether the persistent or pressing conduct must be found in the
actual approach to the person alleged to have been solicited or whether it
could be found in repeated earlier approaches to various unknown persons.

Held: The
appeals should be dismissed.

To convict, the Crown had to show both the
offer of services as a prostitute and an element of persistence or pressing
conduct in presenting that offer. This latter element was not established and
evidence that respondent approached others did not supply the deficiency. With
no evidence of what either respondent said in her earlier accostings, it would
be improper to draw the

[Page 607]

inference that she offered herself for
prostitution on each occasion. Even if that inference were to be drawn, there
is no connection between the earlier approaches and the final accosting of the
police officer. Each previous accosting was an independent act directed at an
unidentified individual and unrelated to the final approaches made to the two
police officers.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—There are two separate appeals
before the Court in these proceedings. Each one raises the same point of law
and they were heard together and will be disposed of together. They raise again
the question of the meaning of the word ‘solicit’, as it appears in
s. 195.1  of the Criminal Code , which is reproduced hereunder:

SOLICITING

195.1 Every
person who solicits any person in a public place for the purpose of
prostitution is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

[Page 608]

This section has been considered in the
courts on many occasions. The leading case on the subject, which must govern
our approach to the matter, is Hutt v. The Queen[2]. Spence J., speaking for the majority of
this Court, held that the word ‘solicit’, as used in s. 195.1  of the Criminal
Code , included an element of persistence or pressure. It was decided that
the mere demonstration by a woman of her willingness and availability for
prostitution would not suffice to ground a conviction. In addition, the Crown
would be required to prove that her approach to a prospective customer was
accompanied by pressure or persistent conduct.

The respondent Whitter was charged that:

At the City of Vancouver, Province of
British Columbia, on the 18th day of July, A.D., 1979 [she] unlawfully did
solicit a person in a public place, to wit, the 1000
 Block Granville Street, for the purpose of
prostitution, contrary to the form of the Statute in such case made and
provided.

Between about 9:40 p.m. and 10:02 p.m. on July 18, 1979 she was seen to approach seven men
in the 1000 block Granville Street in Vancouver,
admittedly a public place, and at 10:02 p.m. she spoke to an undercover
officer. During her conversation with the officer she offered to prostitute
herself and was arrested. At trial, the judge held that she had approached the
officer for the purpose of prostitution, and considered that the cumulative
effect of her previous approaches to other men supplied the element of persistence,
called for in Hutt, and made her approach to the police officer a
‘soliciting’ within the meaning of s. 195.1 of the Code. She was
accordingly convicted. Her appeal to the County Court under s. 758 of the Code
succeeded. The learned County Court Judge held, as a matter of law, that to
find a solicitation consideration must be limited to the circumstances of the
approach to the person said to have been solicited. The Crown’s appeal to the
Court of Appeal was dismissed with one dissenting judgment and the appeal to
this Court resulted.

[Page 609]

The respondent Galjot was charged that:

at the City of Vancouver, Province of
British Columbia, on the 21st day of May, A.D. 1979, [she] unlawfully did
solicit a person in a public place, to wit, the 800 block West Georgia Street,
for the purpose of prostitution, contrary to the form of the statute in such
case made and provided.

On May 21, 1979 she was seen to approach seven
males between 8:56 p.m. and 10:53 p.m. At 10:53 p.m. she approached an undercover police officer and
advanced a proposition to him, clearly indicating a willingness and an
availability for prostitution. She too was arrested. Her passage through the
courts paralleled that of Whitter: convicted at trial, acquitted on appeal to
the County Court and at the Court of Appeal.

The same issues arose and were disposed of in
each case. There was no evidence adduced in either case of what may have been
said by the respondents to the various men approached before accosting the
police officers, and there was nothing in either case in what passed between
the respondents and the police officers which would import the element of
persistence or pressure required for a solicitation. In each case the trial
judge drew an inference that the earlier approaches had been for the purpose of
prostitution and then found in such approaches the necessary persistent or
pressing conduct and related it to the approach to the police officers.

The obligation of the Crown to show pressing or
persistent conduct was recognized throughout these proceedings in all courts.
Judicial opinion, however, differed on the question of whether the persistent
or pressing conduct must be found in the actual approach to the person alleged
to have been solicited, or whether it could be found in the repeated earlier
approaches to various unknown persons. The resolution of this question is
central to these appeals because, as noted above, it was common ground that
there was nothing of a pressing or persistent nature, as required by the Hutt
case, in the approaches by the respondents to the police officers.

[Page 610]

Counsel for the Crown contended that in each
case one act of soliciting had been made out by the cumulative effect of a
series of encounters, one of which involved the police officer. He said in his
factum in the Whitter appeal:

It is submitted that a correct statement of
the law is that it was open to the Trial Court Judge to conclude that a series
of events which took place between 9:40 p.m. and 10:02 p.m. disclosed a single
offence of soliciting and that the elemtn [sic] of
“persistence” called for by the Supreme Court of Canada in Hutt vs. The
Queen was provided by the cumulative effect of the various “soft sells”.

This argument had been raised in the Court of
Appeal and rejected by Bull J.A., for the majority, in these terms:

It is plain that it was the respondent’s
encounter and arrangement with the undercover Detective Kajander, and with
respect to which she was arrested, that was the subject matter of the charge.
This is pointed up by the form of the charge that she did solicit “a person”.
If the Crown had intended to cover an offence involving eight different
persons, it should, in elementary fairness, have so said, and then, of course,
open itself to an attack on the validity of the charge.

Counsel for the Crown contended that
consideration of the earlier accostings in deciding whether the offence charged
had been made out did not offend the ‘one transaction’ rule, found in
s. 510  of the Criminal Code , and made applicable to these summary
conviction proceedings by s. 729(1) of the Code. He referred on
this aspect of the matter to several cases, including R. v. Canavan and
Busby[3]; R.
v. Flynn[4]; R.
v. Kisinger and Voszler[5]; R.
v. Zamal et al.[6] and R.
v. Hulan[7], in
support of the proposition that a series of events could be so closely related
in time, place and circumstance that they could form one transaction. He then
contended that it was open to the Court to consider the cumulative effect of
the earlier accostings in deciding whether proof had been made of all elements
of the charge of soliciting.

[Page 611]

Without expressing any view on the cases cited I
agree with Bull J.A., in the Court of Appeal, that the principles therein
enunciated have no application in these appeals. The cases cited, as well as
involving a series of complete offences—which is not the case here—demonstrate
a much closer relationship between the separate incidents than existed in the
present cases. Furthermore, they provide, in my view, no authority for the approach
taken by the Crown as set out above.

To begin with, there is no evidence in the
record of what was said by either respondent in her earlier accostings. One
would be naive to think that she was asking for a match or discussing politics
or other matters of general social concern on these occasions, but there is no
evidence on the point and in such a case, in my view, it would not be proper to
draw an inference against the respondents. The earlier accostings therefore can
afford no assistance in proof of the Crown’s case. Furthermore, even if one
draws an inference that on each prior occasion the respondent offered herself
for prostitution, I cannot see any connection between the earlier approaches
and the final accosting of the police officer. Each of the previous accostings
was an independent act directed at one individual whose identity is unknown;
they were unconnected and not related to the final approaches to the two police
officers. If any one of the men approached by the respondents had been receptive
and accepted the offers made, no doubt the couple would have departed and the
police officer would not have been approached. At the most, the Crown has shown
that the respondents may have been plying their trade energetically, but the
prior accostings were not related to the charge in respect of the police
officers. They may not be described as a series of steps which have a
cumulative effect upon the final accosting. They are more fittingly described
as a series of alternative steps adopted by the respondents in the pursuit of
their trade, but in no way directed to, or connected with, the final approach
to the police officer and, therefore, lacking any capacity to contribute to the
nature of the final approach.

In my view, these cases are clear. The respondents
were charged in the words of the section with

[Page 612]

‘soliciting a person’. From the evidence adduced
it was abundantly clear that that person, in each case, was the police officer
named in the evidence. To convict, the Crown then had to show, in addition to
the offer of her services as a prostitute, an element of persistence or
pressing conduct in the presentation of that offer. This, the Crown admittedly
did not do, and in my view, evidence that she approached others cannot, for the
reasons I have endeavoured to outline, supply the deficiency.

In dissenting from the majority in the Court of
Appeal, McFarlane J.A. expressed the view that on this issue the trial judge
could consider a prostitute’s conduct towards “any number of persons where that
conduct is reasonably connected as to time and place with the offence charged”.
He referred to the history of the legislation which was commented upon by
Spence J. in Hutt, supra, at p. 484, and expressed the view that
the parliamentary intent in enacting s. 195.1  of the Criminal Code  was
to abate the social nuisance and inconvenience caused by the practice of
soliciting for prostitution in public.

It may well be that the parliamentary intention
in this regard in enacting s. 195.1 of the Code was that described
by the learned dissenting judge. For the reasons which I have endeavoured to
express above, however, it is my opinion that the enactment does not give
effect to that intention, and renders compliance with the terms of the
enactment and achievement of any such parliamentary intention impossible. If
change is desirable in this respect, it is my view that legislative action
would be necessary. Accordingly, I would dismiss both appeals.

Appeals dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Weapons offence—Sentencing—Use
of firearm while committing indictable offence—First offence minimum sentence
less than subsequent offence minimum sentence—Prior offence where accused not
in personal possession of weapon occurring before offence created—Sentence to
be imposed—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34, s. 83(1)(a),(d), (2), as
amended.

The issue in this appeal was whether the
consecutive sentence imposed on appellant for use of a firearm while committing
an indictable offence was to be for a minimum one-year term for a first offence
under Criminal Code  s. 83(1) (c) or for a minimum three-year term
for a second or subsequent offence under s. 83(1) (d). Accused’s
earlier conviction for being party to a robbery where a gun had been possessed
and pointed by another person occurred before the enactment of s. 83 .
Appellant appealed the substitution by the Manitoba Court of Appeal of a
three-year minimum term for the one-year minimum term given at trial.

Held: The
Appeal should be dismissed.

Section 83(1) (d) applied to this case.
The words of the section overcame any issue of retroactivity, even
assuming that that issue would otherwise govern. Moreover, the words “in the
course of which he used a firearm” could not be read so restrictively as to
exclude the application of s. 21 where s. 21(1) defined who was a
party to an offence, and s. 21(2) defined who were parties by engaging in
a common unlawful purpose and carrying it out as defined. The Code generally
defines offences in terms of those who commit them and the culpability of a
person, such as a party under s. 21, has never been excluded except where
the definition was

[Page 601]

clearly limited to those committing the offence.
This limitation was not achieved by s. 83(1) (a) or (d).

Paquette v. The
Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 189, distinguished; Kienapple v. The
Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal[1],
allowing an appeal from the sentence imposed at trial and substituting another.
Appeal dismissed.

D.E. Bowman, for the appellant.

J.G.B. Dangerfield, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—Although this appeal has some
affinity with McGuigan v. The Queen, heard immediately before the
present case, it is based on a much narrower and, indeed, on a very special
ground. The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery under Criminal
Code , s. 302 (d) (stealing while armed with an offensive weapon, a
handgun) and also to a charge under s. 83(1)(a) of using a
firearm while committing the indictable offence of robbery. He was sentenced to
a term of four years on the robbery. A question then arose whether the
consecutive sentence prescribed under s. 83(2)  was to be a minimum
one-year term as for a first offence under s. 83(1) (c) or a minimum
three-year as for a second or subsequent offence under s. 83(1) (d)
or by reason of a prior offence committed before the enactment of
s. 83(1) (d).

The issue arose in this way. In 1969, prior to
the enactment of s. 83 (which came into force in 1978), the accused had
been convicted as a party to an offence of robbery in which a gun had been

[Page 602]

possessed and pointed by another person. The
Provincial Court Judge, in sentencing the accused for the offence under
s. 83(1) (a), accepted a defence contention that s. 83(1) (c)
applied and not s. 83(1) (d) and, consequently, sentenced the
accused to a consecutive one‑year term as for a first offence. On appeal
by the Crown, the Manitoba Court of Appeal, speaking through Matas J.A.,
concluded that s. 83(1) (d) applied and substituted a
sentence of three years consecutive to the four-year term for robbery.

Section 83, which it is desirable to set out in
full, reads as follows:

83. (1)
Every one who uses a firearm

(a) while committing or attempting
to commit an indictable offence, or

(b) during his flight after
committing or attempting to commit an indictable offence,

whether or not he causes or means to cause
bodily harm to any person as a result thereof, is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment

(c) in the case of a first offence
under this subsection, except as provided in paragraph (d), for
not more than fourteen years and not less than one year; and

(d) in the case of a second
or subsequent offence under this subsection, or in the case of a first such
offence committed by a person who, prior to the coming into force of this
subsection, was convicted of an indictable offence or an attempt to commit an
indictable offence, in the course of which or during his flight after the
commission or attempted commission of which he used a firearm, for not more
than fourteen years and not less than three years.

(2) A sentence imposed on a person for an
offence under subsection (1) shall be served consecutively to any other
punishment imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same event or
series of events and to any other sentence to which he is subject at the time
the sentence is imposed on him for an offence under subsection (1).

[Page 603]

Counsel for the accused does not raise the Kienapple
defence (Kienapple v. The Queen[2])
of multiple convictions for the same matter or delict, a defence raised in the McGuigan
case. Nor does he contend that on any other ground (and other grounds were
raised in the McGuigan case) the accused could not properly be convicted
under s. 83(1) (a). His sole submission is that s. 83(1) (d)
cannot support the increased sentence imposed by the Manitoba Court of Appeal,
both because it would involve retrospective imposition of punishment (by
analogy to nulla poena sine lege) and because even if s. 83(1) (d)
could apply to an offence involving a firearm committed before the enactment of
s. 83, its application was restricted to a case where the accused had
himself used or possessed a firearm and not where his prior culpability was
only as a party.

Counsel for the accused did not contest the
proposition that if today an accused were found guilty of robbery, involving
use of a firearm, as a party to the offence under Criminal Code , s. 21 
and, subsequently, was again convicted of using a firearm while committing
robbery or convicted as a party to the subsequent offence, he would be liable
to the extended consecutive sentence prescribed by s. 83(1) (d). He
was not conceding the point, however, because he did not have to face it in the
present case. Similarly, he did not have to meet the case of an accused in 1969
having himself used or possessed a firearm while committing robbery.

In counsel’s view, a construction of
s. 83(1) (d) that would apply to the accused would have the effect
of punishing him for his complicity in robbery with a firearm in 1969 when he
could not have known nor ought he to have known that his involvement in 1969 as
a party pursuant to s. 21(2) would expose him years later to an increased
penalty for an offence for which he had already

[Page 604]

been punished or would expose him to an
additional penalty under a subsequently created penal provision.

The question, as both counsel for the Crown and
for the accused made plain, is what does s. 83(1) (d) command. It is
plain to me that s. 83(1) (d) envisages the kind of case which is
now before us. I refer to the following words of that provision:

…in the case of a first such offence
committed by a person who, prior to the coming into force of this subsection,
was convicted of an indictable offence… in the course of which… he used a
firearm…

In their application to the present case they
overcome any issue of retrospectivity urged by the appellant, even assuming
that issue would otherwise govern. Moreover, I am of the opinion that the words
“in the course of which he used a firearm” cannot be read so restrictively as
to exclude the application of s. 21 , defining in s. 21(1) who is a
party to an offence and, under s. 21(2), who are parties by engaging in a
common unlawful purpose and carrying it out as defined in that provision.

The Code generally defines offences in
terms of those who commit them and, save where the definition is clearly
limited to those committing, it has never been applied to exclude culpability
of a person as a party under s. 21 . I do not find that paras. 83(1)(a)
or (d) have this limited effect.

Paquette v. The
Queen[3] concerning
the defence of duress or compulsion under s. 17  of the Criminal Code  is
a different case from the present one. There the Court construed s. 17 , in
its provision of an excuse from culpability, as affording that excuse only in
favour of a person who himself commits an offence under the defined duress or
compulsion. The Court gave a limited construction to s. 17  so as to
exclude reliance on it by a person who was a party by virtue of s. 21 .
Moreover, the defence is not available even to an accused committing an offence
if the offence is robbery or

[Page 605]

murder, as was the Paquette case. In the
result, the accused there had to rely on s. 7(3)  of the Criminal Code  as
providing a common law defence outside of s. 17 , and he succeeded thereon
because of the Court’s conclusion that s. 21(2)  could not implicate him
when the duress or compulsion practised upon him prevented him from forming a
genuine intention to carry out an unlawful purpose with the person who had
exerted the duress or compulsion. I see no correspondence between a limited
exculpatory provision as that found in s. 17  and the exoneration asserted
under s. 83(1) (a) and (d) to relieve a person from
liability, outside of any excuse of duress or compulsion, where he is a party
to an offence under s. 21(1)  or (2) .

I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, s. 4.

Appellants, a married couple, were convicted
of a criminal offence, along with two other persons. At trial, authorized
interceptions of private telephone conversations by the four accused, including
conversations between the husband and wife, were admitted following a ruling in
a voir dire. The Court of Appeal dismissed appellants’ appeals from
these convictions. The issue considered by this Court was whether Debra Lloyd’s
intercepted conversations with her husband should have been excluded because of
the conjoint effect of s. 178.16(5)  of the Criminal Code  and
s. 4(3)  of the Canada Evidence Act . A second issue, dealing
with the right to appeal to this Court arose, did not require determination.

Held (Martland,
McIntyre and Lamer JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed with respect
to Debra Lloyd but dismissed with respect to Brian Lloyd.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Dickson, Estey and Chouinard JJ.: Debra Lloyd’s intercepted
conversations with her husband should have been excluded because of the
conjoint effect of s. 178.16(5)  of the Criminal Code  and
s. 4(3)  of the Canada Evidence Act . The equally authoritative
French version of s. 178.16(5) , and especially the words exemption de
communication, clarified the proper construction to be given the English
version. There is a privilege both in a spouse’s choice to divulge or to refuse
to divulge information conveyed by the

[Page 646]

other spouse, and in the information
conveyed.

Per Ritchie
J.: The issues raised did not materially differ from those in R. v. Jean and
Piesinger and considering the importance of continuity in the development
of the law, the appeal should be disposed of as proposed by Laskin C.J.

Per Beetz J.:
Beetz J. concurred with the conclusions of Laskin C.J.

Per Martland,
McIntyre and Lamer JJ., dissenting: The privilege created by
s. 4(3)  is against compulsory disclosure of marital communications. It is
a testimonial privilege giving a right to withhold evidence, but the
information itself is not privileged. The recipient may disclose the
information irrespective of the wishes of, or the interest of, the spouse.
Section 178.16(5)  consequently could have no application here because no
information which “but for the interception would have been privileged” was
involved.

APPEAL from a judgment of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal[1]
dismissing an appeal from conviction. Appeal in respect of Debra Lloyd allowed,
and appeal in respect of Brian Lloyd dismissed, Martland, McIntyre and Lamer
JJ. dissenting.

K.G. Young and A.H. Silverman, for the
appellants.

Mark M. DeWeerdt, Q.C., and S. David
Frankel, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Dickson, Estey
and Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The appellants, husband and
wife, were indicted along with two others on a charge of conspiracy to traffic
in a narcotic. Pursuant to an authorization granted by Hutcheon J.

[Page 647]

under Criminal Code , s. 178.12(1) ,
private telephone conversations among the four accused, including telephone
conversations between the spouses, were intercepted by the police and were
sought to be adduced in evidence at their trial. The presiding judge, Harding
Co.Ct.J., held a voir dire on the admissibility of the intercepted
conversations, concluded as a result thereof that they were admissible and
subsequently convicted all the accused.

The appellants herein appealed their
convictions, and their appeals were dismissed by a majority of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal (Hinkson and Aikins JJ.A.), Lambert J.A. dissenting.
The case is here based on the latter’s dissent.

Two points were taken by the appellants in the
British Columbia Court of Appeal. They contended, first, that the admissibility
of the intercepted private conversations depended upon a proper authorization,
that an authorization which allowed interception of conversations by or with a
person not named in the authorization although his identity was known at the
time the authorization was granted, would not be a proper one and, second, that
it should be open to the trial Judge to inquire into this (and presumably other
matters going to the validity of the authorization) in considering the
admissibility of the intercepted conversations. Hinkson J.A., who delivered the
majority judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal took the view that
although the trial Judge had held a voir dire, it was not for him to
look behind the authorization; rather, he was required to accept it at face
value. Lambert J.A., in the course of his dissenting reasons, accepted the
trial Judge’s finding of credibility on the voir dire, but concluded
that certain interceptions of conversations between the female appellant Debra
Lloyd and persons other than her husband were not lawfully made. It was his
view that, as a matter of mixed fact and law, Debra Lloyd’s identity was known
in a relevant way when the challenged authorization was granted and, since she
was not named, the particular conversations to which she was a party should not
have been admitted.

[Page 648]

Two issues arose in connection with this matter
at the hearing before this Court. First, the right to appeal to this Court. An
appeal to this Court based on a dissent below must under Criminal Code , s.
618(1) (a), be on a question of law alone, and that is not this case.
Counsel for the appellants urged, however, that there was another question of
law involved, namely whether a trial Judge was entitled or required to permit
examination and cross-examination on the validity of the authorization, that
is, on whether it was issued under the affidavit and other conditions governing
the granting thereof under the Criminal Code . Since in this case a voir
dire had in fact been held, the question raised by counsel does not arise
for decision and this Court concluded that it was better to leave this issue to
be determined in a case where a decision thereon was required. Accordingly,
counsel for the respondent Crown was not called upon to answer the first ground
of appeal.

The second ground raised, and based properly on
a question of law in Lambert J.A.’s dissent, was whether Debra Lloyd’s
intercepted conversations with her husband should have been excluded because of
the conjoint effect of Criminal Code , s. 178.16(5)  and s. 4(3)  of
the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10. These provisions read as
follows:

178.16 …

(5) Any information obtained by an
interception that, but for the interception would have been privileged, remains
privileged and inadmissible as evidence without the consent of the person
enjoying the privilege.

4. …

(3) No husband is compellable to disclose
any communication made to him by his wife during their marriage, and no wife is
compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during
their marriage.

In holding that there was no privilege calling
for protection under s. 178.16(5) , Hinkson J.A. refused to follow the
judgment of the Alberta Appel-

[Page 649]

late Division in R. v. Jean and
Piesinger[2]. It
was, however, followed by Lambert J.A. In the Jean and Piesinger case,
Moir J.A., speaking for the Alberta Appellate Division dealt with the question
of the admissibility of intercepted communications between husband and wife, as
follows: (at p. 352)

I have already set out the relevant portion
of s. 178.16(1)  and (5) . Under subs. (1), as long as the interception was
lawful it would be admissible against either the originator or receiver of it.
However, the question arises as to the effect of subs. (5) when the
conversation is between husband and wife and intended by both of them that they
alone should hear it.

So far as I am aware, the only
conversations to which subs. (5) could apply are between solicitor and client
and husband and wife. The subsection speaks of information that would have
been privileged but for the interception. It seems to me that there was no
information that was ever privileged per se, because if the solicitor and
client or husband and wife were overheard there was no privilege. What really
occurred was that a witness was able to decide whether or not the contents of
certain communications were to be revealed. In a solicitor-and-client
relationship the client could determine whether or not he would permit the
conversation between himself and his lawyer to be revealed. The recipient of
the conversation between spouses could decide if he would reveal the
communication. In both cases, if the party who had the right chose to exercise
it the communication could be said to be privileged.

In my opinion, we must make the same sort
of deductions to make sense of subs. (5) of s. 178.16 of the Code. Parliament
must be taken to have legislated sensibly, and thus we must give subs. (5) a
sensible meaning. To do so, it must be taken to mean that the so-called
“privileged information” is that information that a person has a right not to
reveal. Then, if it is intercepted by a wiretap or by other means dealt with in
Pt. IV. 1 of the Criminal Code , it is inadmissible by reason of subs. (5) of
s. 178.16 . This follows from the philosophy of the “Invasion of Privacy”
legislation, which proceeds on the basis that these two types of information
are private and that if they are disclosed by a lawful intercept the
information cannot be revealed in court.

[Page 650]

Here, the wife had a right not to reveal
what was said to her by her spouse during marriage. The conversation was
overheard on a lawful interception. What was heard cannot be revealed where the
wife does not choose to reveal it. The conversation was, in my respectful
opinion, properly excluded by the learned trial judge on a proper
interpretation of s. 178.16.

An appeal was taken by the Crown from the
judgment of the Alberta Appellate Division and it was dismissed in short oral
reasons delivered at the conclusion of the appellant Crown’s argument. Those
reasons were as follows, as reported in [1980] 1 S.C.R. 400:

We do not need to hear you
Mr. Stevens-Guille. We are not satisfied that we should reverse the
judgment of the Alberta Appellate Division or interfere with the rulings and
conclusions of the trial judge. The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.

An examination of the materials filed on the
appeal shows that the admissibility of conversations between the spouses,
intercepted pursuant to a lawful authorization, was directly in issue. My notes
of the course of argument were to the effect that counsel for the respondents
was told at the conclusion of the Crown’s argument that we did not need to hear
him on the question of the admissibility of the intercepted conversations
because the matter was plainly covered by s. 178.16(5)  of the Criminal
Code  and s. 4(3)  of the Canada Evidence Act .

I should note that the British Columbia Court of
Appeal did not have the advantage of the judgment of this Court in the Jean
and Piesinger case when it delivered judgment in the case now before us.
Its judgment was handed down on February 4, 1980; this Court spoke on the issue
herein on March 19, 1980. The position taken by Hinkson J.A. on the effect of
s. 178.16(5)  does not differ from what was urged upon this Court in the Jean
and Piesinger appeal. He said in his reasons that while there may be a
privilege in a spouse to choose what course to follow, that is to divulge or
refuse to divulge the information conveyed, that does not make the information
privileged. In his words, “it is a privilege attaching to a witness, not to the
information”.

[Page 651]

In my view, even apart from the effect of this
Court’s recent decision in the Jean and Piesinger case, the learned
Justice of Appeal has taken too narrow a view of the conjoint effect of
s. 178.16(5)  and s. 4(3) . The equally authoritative French version of
s. 178.16(5)  adds illumination to the proper approach to or construction
of the English version. The French version reads as
follows:

178.16 …

(5) Tout renseignement obtenu par une
interception et pour lequel, si ce n’était l’interception, il y aurait eu
exemption de communication, demeure couvert par cette exemption et n’est pas
admissible en preuve sans le consentement de la personne jouissant de
l’exemption.

I emphasize the words exemption de
communication.

It was conceded by the Crown and agreed by
counsel for the appellants that if the appeal should succeed on the issue of
admissibility of the intercepted conversations between the spouses, Debra Lloyd
alone should be acquitted.

The result is therefore, that the appeal should
be allowed in respect of Debra Lloyd, the judgment of the Courts below
affecting her should be set aside and an acquittal entered. The appeal of Brian
Lloyd must be dismissed.

The following are the reasons of

RITCHIE J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment prepared for delivery by the Chief Justice in this
appeal and like him I cannot find that the issues here raised differ so
materially from those before the Court in March 1980 in the R. v. Jean and
Piesinger[3] appeal
as to warrant our departing from what was decided in that case.

The importance of continuity in the development
of the law is the overwhelming consideration which persuades me to agree that
this appeal should be disposed of in the manner proposed by the Chief Justice.

[Page 652]

The following are the reasons of

BEETZ J.—I agree with the conclusions of the
Chief Justice.

The reasons of Martland, McIntyre and Lamer JJ.
were delivered by

MCINTYRE J. (dissenting)—I have had the
benefit of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by the Chief Justice. He
has set out the facts and described the issues which were raised in this
appeal. As he has said, the Court did not call upon counsel for the respondent
Crown on the first point concerning the right of the trial judge to permit examination
and cross examination on the validity of the authorization, and accordingly I
will confine my comments to the second point which raised the issue of
privilege for the communications which passed between husband and wife and
which were intercepted by the police. The statutory provisions with which we
are concerned are set out below:

THE CRIMINAL CODE

178.16 …

(5) Any information obtained by an
interception that, but for the interception would have been privileged, remains
privileged and inadmissible as evidence without the consent of the person
enjoying the privilege.

CANADA EVIDENCE ACT 

4. (1) Every
person charged with an offence, and, except as otherwise provided in this
section, the wife or husband, as the case may be, of the person so charged, is
a competent witness for the defence, whether the person so charged is charged
solely or jointly with any other person.

(2) The wife or husband of a person charged
with an offence against section 33 or 34 of the Juvenile Delinquents
Act or with an offence against any of sections 143  to 146 , 148 , 150  to
155 , 157 , 166  to 169 , 175 , 195 , 197 , 200 , 248  to 250 , 255  to 258 , 289,
paragraph 423(1)(c) or an attempt to commit an offence under
section 146  or 155  of the Criminal Code , is a competent and
compellable witness for the prosecution without the consent of the person
charged.

(3) No husband is compellable to disclose
any communication made to him by his wife during their marriage, and no wife is
compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during
their marriage.

[Page 653]

(4) Nothing in this section affects a
case where the wife or husband of a person charged with an offence may at
common law be called as a witness without the consent of that person.

(5) The failure of the person charged, or
of the wife or husband of such person, to testify, shall not be made the
subject of comment by the judge, or by counsel for the prosecution.

The appellants argue that the intent of
s. 178.16(5)  of the Criminal Code  is to preserve privileges which
have been established in the law of evidence. They then say that s. 4(3) 
of the Canada Evidence Act  creates a privilege for communications
between husband and wife made and received during the marriage. The effect of
s. 178.16(5) of the Code is to preserve the privilege,
notwithstanding the interception, so that the content of the communications may
not be used in evidence against the spouses. The respondent argues that no
privilege attaches to the communications by virtue of s. 4(3)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  which creates only an evidentiary or testimonial privilege
appertaining to the spouses and that, as a result, s. 178.16(5) of the Code
does not apply to the communications in question.

This latter view was substantially accepted by
Hinkson J.A. for the majority of the Court of Appeal, who said:

In my view, it is not possible to equate
the privilege attaching to a communication between solicitor and client with
the privilege attaching to the spouse who is the recipient of a matrimonial
communication. In the former case it is the information passing from client to
solicitor, or vice versa, that is privileged. In the latter case the
information conveyed is not privileged; the recipient spouse has a right to
divulge or refuse to divulge the information conveyed. This right to choose
what course to follow may be called a privilege but that does not make the
information privileged in respect of which the right to choose is exercised. In
short, it is a privilege attaching to a witness, not to the information. That distinction,
it seems to me, is pointed up by the specific wording of ss. (5).

And after discussing the solicitor and client
privilege he added:

[Page 654]

No privilege is conferred on a spouse who
makes a matrimonial communication. When a husband speaks to a wife, the
information conveyed by the husband to the wife is not privileged. Rather the
wife has the right to refuse to disclose it. She cannot be compelled to do so,
although she may do so if she is properly called as a competent witness.

At common law as a general rule the wife or
husband of an accused was incompetent to give evidence for the prosecution
except in cases where an offence had been committed against the person or
liberty of the marriage partner: see Halsbury, Laws of England, (4th
ed.) vol. 11, para. 470 (at p. 282). Statutory intervention has
altered the situation in many jurisdictions. In Canada questions of competency,
compellability and privilege with respect to the evidence of husband and wife
where one is charged with a crime are covered in s. 4  of the Canada
Evidence Act  referred to above. Subsection (1) makes both husband and
wife competent as witnesses for the defence. Subsection (2) renders the
husband and the wife both competent and compellable for the prosecution with
respect to the offences enumerated in the subsection. This
subsection standing alone would remove any marital privilege for either
spouse as far as the enumerated offences are concerned, but by the provisions
of subsection (3) a marital privilege is created which provides that
neither spouse is compellable to disclose any communications made by the other
party during marriage. Subsection (4) preserves any pre-existing common
law right to call a spouse as a witness where the other spouse is charged with
an offence, and subsection (5) prohibits comment by the trial judge or
counsel for the prosecution on the failure of an accused or a spouse to give
evidence.

The privilege created by s. 4(3)  is against
compulsory disclosure of marital communications. The spouse, to whom the
communication has been made, however, while he or she may not be compelled to
disclose it, is of course free to do so if he or she wishes. It is evident then
that the privilege, the right to elect whether the communication will

[Page 655]

be disclosed or not, is personal to the
recipient spouse, and it is equally evident from the wording of s. 4  that
the privilege is one pertaining to a spouse giving evidence in Court. In other
words, it is a testimonial privilege giving a right to withhold evidence, but
it cannot be said that the information itself is privileged. It follows then,
in my view, that s. 178.16(5)  cannot have any application here, because no
information which “but for the interception would have been privileged” is
involved.

The section could have application to a
communication between solicitor and client where the solicitor may not disclose
it and, in fact, will not be permitted by the Court to do so. It is of the
nature of any privilege that it may be waived by the person enjoying it. In the
case of the solicitor and client privilege it is the client alone who may do
so. Until he does he retains control of the information and thereby maintains a
privilege in it. It is in this sense that it may be said a privilege attaches
to the information. In the case of s. 4(3)  of the Canada Evidence Act , however,
the communicator has no control over the disclosure of the information and,
therefore, no privilege in it. The recipient may disclose the information
irrespective of the wishes of, or interest of, the spouse.

It will be seen that, in my view, for the
reasons above stated, no privilege such as that mentioned in s. 178.16(5) 
of the Criminal Code  attached to the communications between husband and
wife in this case and the section has no application. I would dismiss the
appeal.

The Chief Justice has referred in his reasons
for judgment to the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
Alberta in R. v. Jean and Piesinger[4].
I am in agreement with him that

[Page 656]

the same point, which has been discussed here,
came before us in that appeal. I am aware that I have arrived at a conclusion
directly opposite to that of the Alberta court expressed in the Piesinger case.
I also recognize that in dealing with that appeal in this Court ([1980] 1
S.C.R. 400) we expressed the view that we were not satisfied that we should
reverse the judgment of the Alberta Appellate Division and we dismissed the
appeal. I do not consider it would be helpful to indulge in discussion as to
whether or not this Court may be said to have approved the Alberta decision in Piesinger,
but I must say that I would not consider it unreasonable if counsel and the
courts thought that we had done so. I will merely add that upon the facts and
argument presented in this case, and on more lengthy reflection, it is my
opinion that the Piesinger case in this Court should not be followed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL OF ALBERTA

Criminal law—Insanity—Psychopathy—Disease of
the mind—Meaning of “appreciating”—Adequacy of charge to jury—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 16, 618(1)(a).

Appellant, whose only defence was insanity,
was convicted of first degree murder at trial. Medical evidence revealed that
he was a psychopath and understood the physical nature and consequences of his
act, though indifferent to such consequences. The trial judge instructed the
jury (1) that psychopathy could be a disease of the mind and (2) on the meaning
of the word “appreciate” in s. 16  of the Criminal Code . On appeal,
the Court dismissed the appeal but substituted a verdict of second degree
murder because the trial judge failed to instruct the jury adequately on the
difference between first and second degree murder. The principal issue to be
determined was the definition of the word “appreciating” and the adequacy of
the trial judge’s charge to the jury in that respect.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

A person appreciates the nature and quality
of an act within the meaning of s. 16  if he knows what he is doing and is
aware of the physical consequences which will result from his acts. The trial
judge correctly instructed the jury that psychopathy could be a disease of the
mind and on the meaning of “appreciating”; and, in view of the evidence of the
medical witnesses, the instruction was adequate.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Alberta[1],
dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Milvain C.J. but substituting a verdict
of second degree murder for a conviction of first degree murder. Appeal
dismissed.

J. Brimacombe, for the appellant.

Paul S. Chrumka, Q.C, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—This appeal against a conviction for
second degree murder involves consideration of the defence of insanity,
particularly of the words in s. 16(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, “incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act or
omission”. The appellant was charged with first degree murder of a woman
taxi-driver whom he had engaged to drive him from Calgary to Banff on
February 23, 1977. His only defence was insanity, there being no question that
he had killed the woman. He was convicted at trial. The Court of Appeal
dismissed his appeal, but a verdict of guilty of second degree murder was
substituted because of the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury
adequately on the difference between first and second degree murder. The
appellant appeals to this Court under s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code , relying on what is asserted to be a dissent on a point of law in the
Court of Appeal, one of the judges being of the opinion that there was
non-direction of the jury, amounting to misdirection, on certain medical
evidence adduced by the appellant relating to his capacity, at the time of the
killing, to appreciate the nature and quality of his act.

Prior to his encounter with his victim the
appellant had been a patient at a mental hospital in Alberta. He was detained there at the pleasure of the Lieutenant Governor,
having been found not guilty, by reason of insanity, upon charges involv-

[Page 619]

ing rape and attempted murder in 1972. On February 23, 1977 he was given a day pass which
permitted him to leave the hospital. He flew to Calgary and at the airport engaged a taxi, driven by his victim, to take
him into the City. En route he inquired about the fare for a trip from Calgary to Banff. Later in the day he made arrangements with the taxi dispatcher to
have the same driver pick him up in Calgary and drive him to Banff. The résumé of events which occurred on the trip is based upon
statements made by the appellant while in custody and confirmed by physical
evidence found by the police and obtained through the autopsy.

When the taxi had reached the vicinity of the Village of Exshaw, some forty miles from Calgary, the appellant directed the driver
to leave the main highway and to proceed to Exshaw. Shortly thereafter, when
she had complied with this direction, he produced a knife and by threats
compelled her to stop and to submit to sexual intercourse against her will. He
then forced her from the car and brutally killed her by delivering several
blows with a large rock to her head, shattering her skull. He trussed up her
body with her hands behind her back and her legs drawn upwards and tied to her
wrists, forced a wooden gag into her mouth, and left her body in the bushes
where it was found some days later on March 1, 1977. Having so disposed of his
victim, he drove off in the taxi, abandoned it a few miles away, and hitchhiked
to Vancouver. Later, he crossed
over to Victoria where he was
arrested on March 3, 1977.

Section 16  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, covering the defence of insanity,
is reproduced hereunder:

16. (1) No
person shall be convicted of an offence in respect of an act or omission on his
part while he was insane.

(2) For the purposes of this section a
person is insane when he is in a state of natural imbecility or has disease of
the mind to an extent that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.

[Page 620]

(3) A person who has specific delusions,
but is in other respects sane, shall not be acquitted on the ground of insanity
unless the delusions caused him to believe in the existence of a state of
things that, if it existed, would have justified or excused his act or
omission.

(4) Every one shall, until the contrary is
proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane.

Argument in this Court centred upon one
principal issue. It was not contended that the appellant lacked capacity to
know that his acts were wrong, in the sense that they were contrary to law.
Little argument was adduced on the question of whether or not the condition of
psychopathy, which according to the medical evidence affected the appellant,
was a disease of the mind within the meaning of s. 16 of the Code. The
principal issue which was argued before the Court concerned the definition of
the word ‘appreciating’ in s. 16  and the adequacy of the trial judge’s
charge in that respect. It was contended that, by his direction relating to the
definition of the word, he had withdrawn, in effect, the defence of insanity
from the jury.

The medical witnesses, five psychiatrists, two
called for the defence and three for the Crown, were all in agreement that the
appellant was a dangerous psychopath with sexually deviant tendencies. Those
called for the defence applied a wide definition of ‘appreciating’, which
involved not only an ability to foresee the physical consequences of one’s acts
but, as well, a capacity to foresee and understand the subjective or emotional
reactions of those affected. They were of the opinion that a psychopath, such
as the appellant, could not be said to have the capacity to appreciate the
nature and quality of his acts. Those called for the Crown, applying a
definition which was limited to a capacity to understand and foresee the
physical consequences of conduct, were of the view that a psychopath, such as
the appellant, would be fully capable of appreciating the nature and quality of
his acts though indifferent to such consequences.

Two questions of significance present themselves
in this case. Was the appellant at the time of the commission of the act which
killed the victim suffering from a disease of the mind within the meaning of
that expression in s. 16 of the Criminal

[Page 621]

Code and, if so,
did the disease of the mind have the effect of depriving him of the capacity to
appreciate the nature and quality of his acts at the time of his attack upon
the deceased? Both of these questions have been the subject of recent
consideration in this Court in Cooper v. The Queen[2]. Dickson J., for the majority of the
Court, dealt extensively with the concept of disease of the mind. It is
unnecessary for me to refer in detail to his discussion of the matter. He
reached the conclusion, at pp. 1159-60, that:

In summary, one might say that in a legal
sense “disease of the mind” embraces any illness, disorder or abnormal
condition which impairs the human mind and its functioning, excluding however,
self-induced states caused by alcohol or drugs, as well as transitory mental
states such as hysteria or concussion. In order to support a defence of
insanity the disease must, of course, be of such intensity as to render the
accused incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the violent act or
of knowing that it is wrong.

and later:

Once the evidence is sufficient to indicate
that an accused suffers from a condition which could in law constitute disease
of the mind, the judge must leave it open to the jury to find, as a matter of
fact, whether the accused had disease of the mind at the time the criminal act
was committed. The more troublesome issue, where a defence of insanity has been
pleaded, concerns the second criterion to be applied in determining criminal
responsibility. As Martin J.A. pointed out in Rabey:

In many, if not most cases involving the
defence of insanity, the question whether the accused suffered from a disease
of the mind is not the critical issue; the pivotal issue is whether a condition
which, admittedly, constitutes a disease of the mind rendered the accused
incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act or knowing that it
was wrong…

The real question in this case, in my view,
is not whether the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind, but
whether he was capable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act. The
second question ought to have been left to the jury in clear terms.

[Page 622]

Dealing with the concept of ‘appreciating’ the
nature and quality of actions, he noted that the word ‘appreciate’ in this
context must, and does, mean more than ‘know’. At page 1162, he adopted the
test which was proposed in the McRuer Report, in these terms:

The test proposed in the McRuer Report, which
I would adopt, (save for deletion of the word “fully” in the fourth line) is
this:

The true test necessarily is, was the
accused person at the very time of the offence—not before or after, but at the
moment of the offence—by reason of disease of the mind, unable fully to
appreciate not only the nature of the act but the natural consequences that
would flow from it? In other words was the accused person, by reason of disease
of the mind, deprived of the mental capacity to foresee and measure the
consequences of the act? …

This question was also dealt with in this Court
in terms consistent with Dickson J.’s disposition in Cooper, supra, in R.
v. Barnier[3]. In
that case the difference in meaning between the words ‘appreciating’ and
‘knowing’ was vital to the resolution of the case. Psychiatrists at trial had
given evidence to the effect that after considering the judgment of this Court
in Schwartz v. The Queen[4], they
found the accused sane whereas they had originally considered him to be insane
within the meaning of s. 16 of the Code. This change of view was
based on their understanding of the Schwartz case and what they took to
be its holding that the two words were synonymous. The trial judge, adopting
the same view, had charged the jury to the effect that in s. 16  of the Criminal
Code  the words ‘appreciating’ and ‘knowing’ meant the same thing. In
speaking for this Court in Barnier, Estey J. dealt with this situation
in these terms, at p. 1137:

In the ordinary usage of these words in the
language, therefore, it would appear that to appreciate embraces the act of
knowing but the converse is not necessarily true. This lies behind the comment
in Black’s Legal Dictionary, 4th ed., 1951, at p. 130:

Appreciate may be synonymous with “know” or
“understand.”

[Page 623]

The verb “know” has a positive connotation
requiring a bare awareness, the act of receiving information without more. The
act of appreciating, on the other hand, is a second stage in a mental process
requiring the analysis of knowledge or experience in one manner or another. It
is therefore clear on the plain meaning of the section that Parliament
intended that for a person to be insane within the statutory definition, he
must be incapable firstly of appreciating in the analytical sense the nature
and quality of the act or of knowing in the positive sense that his act was
wrong. With these processes, of course, the Schwartz case was in no way
concerned. The psychiatrists, in preparing for trial, either misconstrued the
judgment and thereby the definition contained in s. 16 , or the judgment
was misconstrued for them in their preparation for testimony before the
tribunal, and it matters not which is the case.

I adopt these words and repeat them here for
emphasis. To be capable of ‘appreciating’ the nature and quality of his acts,
an accused person must have the capacity to know what he is doing; in the case
at bar, for example, to know that he was hitting the woman on the head with the
rock, with great force, and in addition he must have the capacity to estimate
and to understand the physical consequences which would flow from his act, in
this case that he was causing physical injury which could result in death.

In his charge to the jury on the question of
disease of the mind, the trial judge had this to say:

I am satisfied that psychopathy, in its
very general sense, because from what the psychiatrists have told us is a
pretty broad and generalized term in describing a condition known to the
doctors of psychiatry, that psychopathy, in at least some of its forms, could
be a disease of the mind which would qualify under the section and if it
is of the nature that qualifies, it has to have with it those two attributes of
the incapacity, or one of the two attributes, either incapacity of appreciating
the nature and quality of the act, or of knowing that the act was wrong. It is
not required that both those conditions be met, one of them is sufficient. They
might have the incapacity to appreciate and yet know that the act was wrong and
they would come under the provisions of the statute.

There was overwhelming evidence that the
appellant was a psychopath. There was medical evidence that supported the trial
judge’s conclusion that psychopathy could be a disease of the mind. It

[Page 624]

was in these circumstances for the trial judge,
as a matter of law, to decide whether psychopathy was or could be within the
definition of a disease of the mind under s. 16 . I take it from the words
he used, which are referred to above, that he reached the conclusion that it
could so qualify and he, therefore, made no error in leaving it to the jury,
whose function it then became to consider the evidence and decide whether, as a
matter of fact, the appellant was a psychopath.

On the more important question, whether or not
the appellant was capable of appreciating the nature and quality of his acts or
knowing that they were wrong, concerning as it does the actual mental condition
of the appellant and being determinative of his criminal responsibility, he
said:

Now, both of them [the defence
psychiatrists] tell us that by and large that if he were stopped step by step
that he would know what he was doing, he would realize that he was having
sexual intercourse, he would realize that he was pointing a knife, he would
realize that he was tying up, he would realize that he was hitting with a rock
but that he would not have an appreciation of all of the consequences that flow
from that act and that they say because of his psychopathic condition he would
be incapable of so appreciating.

Now, there is no doubt that as a matter of
law their definition of “appreciate” is not the one to be accepted within the
realm of the law because you and I, either fortunately or unfortunately, I do
not know which it is, we are bound to take the law as it is and as it has been
defined by courts from time to time.

We do not embark on excursions that lead us
into a field where we would say well, we think the law ought to be this or it
ought to be that, or we would like to see it this way or that way, we take it
as it is and the construction that should be placed on those words “appreciate
the nature and quality of the act” and particularly using in it that is the
case the word “appreciate”.

It has been defined, not in specific terms
as you are going to read it in the dictionary but it has been defined and I
tell you that nature and quality of the act is confined to an appreciation of
the physical character of what he was doing. Now, the physical character of the
act would be the physical character or, as I say, the act of intercourse, the
act of the knife, the act of the blows with a rock, the act of tying, the act
of gagging, the act of leaving in the condition that this woman was left, that
is those physical things and you might say rather this

[Page 625]

simply, if he had an appreciative
awareness of striking with a stone that it might cause death or injury, that
has brought us within the meaning of this section, regardless of what his
emotional attributes might be, or regardless of what the emotional effect would
be on the victim, one does not say that it changes the physical nature of the
act one bit. If it does or does not frighten the victim, if it does or does
not please the accused, whether it excites him or horrifies him, it is neither
here nor there. It is a knowledge or an awareness and appreciation of the
physical nature of the act, or combination of acts that matter.

This of course leaves us in a field where
we do not need to go out into a wide field of esoteric heric [sic] speculation
and search to find out what somebody felt or what somebody’s emotions were, or
what the individual reaction might be, it is a question of whether or not there
was an appreciation of the physical nature of what was being done. [Emphasis
added]

I draw special attention to the emphasized
portion of the trial judge’s remarks in order to show that, though in the
earlier part of that paragraph he had said: “…I tell you that nature and
quality of the act is confined to an appreciation of the physical character of
what he was doing”, he did not limit the application of the word ‘appreciate’
to the mere physical character of actions but included, as well, reference to
the consequences which flowed from them.

This direction was attacked because it was
asserted that it involved the adoption of an incorrect and too limited
definition of the word ‘appreciate’. It will be observed that the trial judge’s
direction limited the scope of the term to the physical consequences. In this I
consider he was right. In the emphasized portion of the extract from the charge
reproduced above the trial judge, in my view, correctly stated the position in
a manner consistent with the views expressed by Dickson J., for the majority of
this Court, in Cooper, supra, and Estey J. for the Court in Barnier,
supra. On this point, I find it helpful to refer to the words of Martin
J.A., speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal, in R. v. Simpson[5], at p. 355.

[Page 626]

Emotional disturbance caused by disease of
the mind may be so severe as to deprive the accused of the use of his
understanding at the time of the act, rendering him incapable of appreciating
the nature and quality of the act or of knowing that it was wrong, and thus exempting
him from liability under s. 16(2) of the Code: see Reference
re Regina v. Gorecki (No. 2) (a judgment of this Court released on
September 14, 1976, not yet reported (since reported 32 C.C.C. (2d) 135, 14
O.R. (2d) 218)). I do not, however, read the psychiatric evidence to be that
the accused was by reason of emotional turmoil produced by disease of the mind
incapable of understanding or realizing what he was doing, but rather that he
lacked normal emotions and was therefore incapable of experiencing normal
feelings concerning the acts, assuming he committed them.

While I am of the view that s. 16(2)
exempts from liability an accused who by reason of disease of the mind has no
real understanding of the nature, character and consequences of the act at the
time of its commission, I do not think the exemption provided by the
section extends to one who has the necessary understanding of the nature,
character and consequences of the act, but merely lacks appropriate feelings
for the victim or lacks feelings of remorse or guilt for what he has done, even
though such lack of feeling stems from “disease of the mind”. Appreciation of
the nature and quality of the act does not import a requirement that the act be
accompanied by appropriate feeling about the effect of the act on other people:
see Willgoss v. The Queen (1960), 105 C.L.R. 295; R. v. Leech (1972),
10 C.C.C. (2d) 149, 21 C.R.N.S. 1, [1973] 1 W.W.R. 744; R. v. Craig (1974),
22 C.C.C. (2d) 212, [1975] 2 W.W.R. 314 (affirmed 28 C.C.C. (2d) 311). No doubt
the absence of such feelings is a common characteristic of many persons who
engage in repeated and serious criminal conduct.

I respectfully adopt the reasoning of Martin
J.A. as a statement on this question consistent with the authorities in this
Court. I am of the view that the trial judge correctly instructed the jury on
the meaning to be applied to the word ‘appreciating’ in this context and that
no reversible error was made upon this point.

It was further argued that the trial judge
failed in his charge to review and put before the jury

[Page 627]

certain parts of the medical evidence given by
defence psychiatrists to the effect that, even accepting what I take to be the
correct interpretation of the word ‘appreciating’, the appellant did not have
the capacity to appreciate the nature and quality of his acts. This omission,
it was said, coupled with the adoption of the limited definition of
‘appreciating’, had the effect of withdrawing for all practical purposes the
defence of insanity from the jury. It was this asserted failure which led to
the dissent in the Court of Appeal and which was, in the opinion of the
dissenting judge, a non-direction amounting to a misdirection. Certain extracts
from the evidence of the defence psychiatrists support the proposition that the
appellant lacked the capacity to appreciate even the physical consequences of
his acts. The trial judge made no specific reference to these comments in his
review of the evidence. I am not persuaded, however, that the omission, if
omission it was, can be said to have been a non-direction amounting to a
misdirection. The trial had been concerned almost entirely with medical
evidence adduced by the Crown and the defence. The medical witnesses gave a
great deal of evidence and were extensively cross-examined. Much examination
and cross-examination concerned this narrow question of the meaning of the word
‘appreciate’, and it is fair to say that the essential dividing line between
the medical evidence for the defence and that of the Crown was on this issue.
Psychiatrists called by the defence based their opinions principally upon an
extended meaning of the word ‘appreciate’, while the Crown witnesses based
their views on the more narrow definition referred to in the authorities cited
earlier. Counsel in their addresses dealt with this question and the real issue
for decision presented itself on this basis. In my opinion, the evidence of the
various medical witnesses was before the jury and had been extensively reviewed
and covered in cross-examination and argument, and the fact that specific
reference was not made by the trial judge to the passages above mentioned
cannot have, in my opinion, the character attributed to it in the dissenting
judgment in the Court of Appeal. For the foregoing reasons, and for the reasons
of the majority in the Court of Appeal with which I am in substantial
agreement, I would

[Page 628]

dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Common assault
charge—Non-appearance of informant—Refusal of Crown’s request for
adjournment—Charge dismissed—New information sworn in identical terms to first
information—Plea of autrefois acquit—Whether plea available in respect of
summary conviction offence—Order of dismissal does not supplant right to raise
plea—No requirement for trial “on the merits”—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, ss. 734, 743(1), (2).

Accused was charged with common assault. He
pleaded not guilty and the matter was adjourned for trial. At the trial the
Crown applied for an adjournment as the complainant was not present. The
application was refused. As the Crown called no evidence, the charge was dismissed
and the accused was discharged.

A week later, the complainant swore a new
information in terms identical to the first information. When the matter came
on before another provincial court judge, the accused entered a plea of autrefois
acquit and the charge was dismissed. In a Crown appeal by way of stated
case, it was held that the plea was available in respect of a summary
conviction offence and that it was applicable in the present case. The Crown
took a further, unsuccessful appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Alberta and finally sought leave to appeal to this Court. Leave was
granted on the following grounds: 1. That the Appellate Division erred in law
in holding that an order of dismissal issued pursuant to s. 743  of the Criminal
Code  does not supplant the common law right to raise the special plea of autrefois
acquit in a summary conviction court. 2. That the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court erred in law in holding that the information was dealt with on
the merits.

[Page 381]

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

As to the plea of autrefois acquit at
common law, the formal status of the plea and the pleading and procedural
technicalities of an earlier day should not stand in the way of an accused
raising as a defence the fact that he has been previously acquitted of the
offence with which he now stands charged. The proper procedure in summary
conviction matters is not to raise the special plea of autrefois acquit, but
simply to enter a general plea of not guilty embracing the concept of res
judicata. Technically, such a general plea is not one of autrefois
acquit but as stated in Flatman v. Light, [1946] 1 K.B. 414 at
p. 419, “…that does not matter”. The court gives effect to the broad
maxim, nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa. The charge has been
dismissed by a court of competent jurisdiction and the accused shall not be
charged again with the same matter.

The submission that the special pleas
authorized in Part XVII (ss. 534-537) of the Criminal Code , headed
“Procedure by Indictment”, are not available in respect of summary conviction
offences, provision for which is contained in Part XXIV, failed. Something akin
to the plea of autrefois acquit was available at common law to a
defendant accused of an offence punishable by summary conviction. That being
so, it would take language other than that found in ss. 534  to 537  to manifest
an intent on the part of Parliament to take away such defence.

Under s. 734, the Code provides
that where, as here, the defendant appears for the trial and the prosecutor
does not appear, the summary conviction court may dismiss the information.
Under s. 743, it is then open to the defendant to request the court to
draw up an order of dismissal, a certified copy of which, without further proof,
is a bar to any subsequent proceedings against him in respect of the same
cause. However, the failure of the defendant in the present case to obtain a
certificate was not fatal to his position. Section 743 is intended to
supplement, and not to supplant, common law rights. It is in aid, rather than
in derogation, of those rights. The certificate affords a mechanism, borrowed
from English statute law of some antiquity, facilitating proof of dismissal of
an information. The granting of a certificate is in the nature of an
administrative act recording the judgment of the summary conviction court. It
is not a judicial act.

[Page 382]

With respect to the second ground upon which
leave to appeal was granted, should the accused avail himself of the
certificate provided for in s. 743(1), subs. (2) bars any subsequent
proceedings in respect of the same cause, without reference to the events
giving rise to the dismissal. In principle, there is no reason why a different
situation ought to prevail where the defendant has not obtained the certified
copy. Nor, in principle, is it easy to distinguish between the situation where
the Crown leads evidence which fails to make out a case for the defendant to
answer and the situation where, as here, no evidence is led. So long as the
case has proceeded to a verdict and a dismissal, that should be sufficient.

The term “on the merits” does nothing to
further the test for the application of the bis vexari maxim. There is
no basis, in the Code or in the common law, for any superadded requirement
that there must be a trial “on the merits”. That phrase merely serves to
emphasize the general requirement that the previous dismissal must have been
made by a court of competent jurisdiction, whose proceedings were free from
jurisdictional error and which rendered judgment on the charge.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1],
dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Laycraft J. in an appeal by way of
stated case from a

[Page 383]

decision of Stevenson Prov. J. accepting a plea of autrefois
acquit on a summary conviction offence and dismissing the information
against the accused. Appeal dismissed.

Paul Chrumka, Q.C., and Miss Donna J.
Martinson, for the appellant.

Marlin Moore, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—Two questions of considerable
practical importance emerge in this appeal: Can an accused raise the special
plea of autrefois acquit in a summary conviction court? If so, is the
plea available when in the earlier proceeding the charge is dismissed following
non‑appearance of the informant and refusal of an adjournment? Judicial
authority and textbook opinion have been divided on both issues. Thus far, the
respondent Riddle has succeeded in three Courts in Alberta.

Judicial History

Riddle was charged with common assault. He
pleaded not guilty and the matter was adjourned for trial. On the appointed
date, a provincial judge endorsed the information: “Accused here. I prefer not
to hear this case. Trial October 22/75 at 10.00 a.m. by consent.”

On October 22, Riddle appeared with his counsel,
and the proceedings were as follows:


 
  
  Mr. Duncan:
  (appearing for the Crown)
  
  
  Sir, this matter is set for trial
  this morning. I believe the Crown witness is here on this. Is
  Mr. DeBruin in the courtroom? Mr. Cairn? Is Mr. DeBruin here
  today? Sir, it appears that the informant, the complainant in this case is
  not present. The Crown would make an application for an adjournment at this
  time.
  
 


[Page 384]


 
  
  The Court:
  
  
  What is the position of the Defence?
  
 
 
  
  Mr. Daines:
  (appearing for the accused)
  
  
  Your Honour, we are here and prepared
  to proceed. We were prepared to proceed on the last occasion when this was
  set down for trial and at that time the case wasn’t reached before Judge
  Harvie. There were too many cases on. I wish to state I think it should be
  dismissed at this point because we are prepared to proceed.
  
 
 
  
  The Court:
  
  
  Is there any explanation why the
  witness is not present?
  
 
 
  
  Mr. Duncan:
  
  
  No information at all, sir, why he is
  not here.
  
 
 
  
  The Court:
  
  
  I would not grant an adjournment. I
  would ask the Crown to call evidence. Is the Crown in a position to do so?
  
 
 
  
  Mr. Duncan:
  
  
  No, sir, the Crown is calling no
  evidence.
  
 
 
  
  The Court:
  
  
  I would dismiss the charge and
  discharge the accused.
  
 
 
  
  Mr. Daines:
  
  
  Thank you, your honour.
  
 


A week later, the complainant swore a new
information in terms identical to the first information. When the matter came
on before another provincial court judge, Riddle entered a plea of autrefois
acquit and the charge was dismissed. A Crown appeal by stated case was
heard by Laycraft J., who in a carefully considered judgment held that the plea
was available in respect of a summary conviction offence and that it was
applicable in the present case. The Crown took a further, unsuccessful appeal
to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and finally sought
leave to appeal to this Court. Leave was granted on the following grounds:

1. That the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta erred in law in holding that an order of dismis-

[Page 385]

sal issued pursuant to Section 743  of the Criminal
Code  does not supplant the common law right to raise the special plea of autrefois
acquit in a summary conviction court.

2. That the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta erred in law in holding that the Information was dealt
with on the merits.

The Plea of autrefois acquit at Common
Law

One of the fundamental rules of the criminal law
is expressed in the maxim, nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadam causa, no
person shall be placed in jeopardy twice for the same matter. By the special
plea of autrefois acquit, founded upon that maxim, the accused says
simply that he has been previously acquitted of the offence with which he is
now charged; that offence is res judicata, i.e. it has passed into a
matter adjudged. A second prosecution is, therefore, not open. In the case at
bar, the respondent says that the assault alleged in the first information has
become converted into res judicata or judgment.

The classic statement of the principle is found
in Hawkins’ Pleas of the Crown (1726), Bk. II, c. 35, p. 368:

That a man shall not be brought into danger
of his life for one and the same offence more than once. From whence it is
generally taken, by all the Books, as an undoubted consequence, that where a
man is once found not guilty on an indictment or appeal free from error,
and well commenced before any court which hath jurisdiction of the cause, he
may by the common law in all cases whatsoever plead such acquittal in bar of
any subsequent indictment or appeal for the same crime.

In short, when a criminal charge has been once
adjudicated by a court having jurisdiction, the adjudication is final and will
be an answer to a later information founded on the same ground of complaint.

Through a series of cases, the Appellate
Division of the Alberta Supreme Court has elaborated its

[Page 386]

views on the availability of autrefois acquit
in summary conviction matters and the extent of that plea: R. v. Blair
and Karashowsky[2]; R.
v. Canadian Pacific Ltd.[3]; and
this case. These decisions have effectively overturned the earlier decision of
the Alberta Appeal Court in R. v. Cooper[4].
The views reflected in the more recent decisions appear to find support in
British Columbia and Ontario in R. v. Ross[5] and R. v. Davis and Lakehead Bag
Co.[6] at
p. 311 (dicta of Wilson J.A.), as well as in Prince Edward Island, R.
v. O’Connell[7]. The
judgment of Morrow J., of the Northwest Territories Territorial Court, in R.
v. Firth[8], and of
Nicholson J. in the Prince Edward Island Supreme Court in R. v. Kinch[9] give further weight to the judgment here
under appeal. A contrary view was held in R. v. Osborne[10].

Here the Crown appellant relies upon the cases
of Cooper and Osborne. In Osborne, Limerick J.A. laid
emphasis upon the historic availability of the plea of autrefois acquit in
respect of indictable offences and not in summary conviction matters. Those
involved in summary conviction courts “were not expected to have the nicety of
legal perception to comprehend the legal concepts involved” in such pleas and,
instead, more general powers of dismissal were confided to Justices of the
Peace. Such powers were unnecessary in indictable matters, where the special
pleas and the participation of the Attorney General assured greater control
over the process. Limerick J.A. then finds further support for this distinction
in the presence of ss. 535 to 537 in the “Procedure by Indictment” part of the Criminal
Code  and an absence of corresponding provisions in Part XXIV. In the
result, he held that the intention of Parliament was “to replace those special
pleas in summary conviction cases with the statutory relief

[Page 387]

afforded by s. 743 of Code.”

With respect, it would seem that those finding autrefois
acquit not available in summary conviction cases at common law give to that
term its narrow and specialized meaning. Professor Friedland in his book, Double
Jeopardy (1969), describes the special pleas at pp. 113-4, noting the
need for a formal record of the former judgment, carefully engrossed on
parchment. Supported by the older case of Weymss v. Hopkins[11] and the more recent case of Flatman v.
Light[12],
Friedland continues:

The special pleas are not strictly
appropriate for cases tried by courts of summary jurisdiction, but the same
result is reached by giving effect to the maxim Nemo debet bis vexari pro
una et eadem causa.

A technical approach was rejected by Lord
Goddard in Flatman and such a narrow approach was dismissed by Blackburn
J. in Weymss in these words:

I think the fact that the jurisdiction of
the justices is created by statute makes no difference. Where the conviction is
by a Court of competent jurisdiction, it matters not whether the conviction is
by a summary proceeding before justices or by trial before a jury. (p. 38)

Further down the same page, Blackburn J. makes
reference to the availability of a certificate “freeing [a person] from further
proceedings, civil or criminal, for the same cause”, which goes further than
the common law, but states explicitly that “in this case we must rely upon the
common law”, and this is in relation to a summary conviction matter.

[Page 388]

In his perceptive article, “Res Judicata in
the Criminal Law” (1961), 3 Melbourne U.L. Rev. 101, Professor Howard states at
p.112:

At the present day the distinction between
courts of summary jurisdiction and superior courts occasions no difficulty.
Although it is pedantically true that an autrefois plea can be made only
to an indictment, there never has been any real doubt that an equivalent
objection can be set up in summary proceedings.

In Paley on Summary Convictions (9th ed.,
1926) at p. 367, the “bis vexari” maxim is stated to be of general
application to civil and criminal proceedings, to actions, orders, summary
convictions and indictments. The text continues:

Consequently, at common law a former
conviction or acquittal, whether on a criminal summary proceeding or an
indictment, will be an answer to an information of a criminal nature before
justices founded on the same facts.

Fullerton J.A. in R. v. Badiuk[13] seems to have been in no doubt that the
plea of autrefois acquit was available at common law to a defendant
proceeded against by way of summary conviction:

Counsel for the Crown contends that the
plea of autrefois acquit is only available to a defendant in the case of
a prosecution by indictment. Both the pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois
convict are founded upon the maxim “nemo debet bis vexari pro una et
eadem causa” and at common law were always available to a defendant whether
proceeded against by way of summary conviction or upon indictment. See Paley
on Summary Convictions, 9th ed., p. 367; Stone’s Justices Manual, 1927,
p. 180. (p. 66)

In Tremeear’s Annotated Criminal Code (6th
ed., 1964) at p. 1531, the author, on the authority of Weymss v.
Hopkins, states:

The general rule is that where a person has
been convicted and punished for an offence by a court of competent jurisdiction,
transit in rem judicatam, i.e. the conviction is a bar to all further
proceedings for the same offence, and he must not be punished again for the
same matter. This applies not only to indictable offences, but also to courts
whose jurisdiction is entirely

[Page 389]

statutory: Weymss v. Hopkins (1875),
L.R. 10 Q.B. 378 (C.A.).

and at p. 1532:

It is doubtful if the plea of autrefois is
applicable to proceedings before justices, because of the special rules as to
raising such a plea. It is probably more correct to say that what a court of
summary jurisdiction must do is to give effect to the maxim nemo debet bis
vexari pro una et eadem causa: Flatman v. Light, [1946] K.B. 414, per Lord
Goddard, C.J.; cf. In re Deserted Wives’ Maintenance Act; In re Wilson, [1948]
1 W.W.R. 680 (B.C.); Burns v. Gan (1955), 112 C.C.C. 395 (Ont.).

Crankshaw’s Criminal Code of Canada (7th ed., 1959) p. 748, is to the same effect.

The formal status of the plea of autrefois
acquit and the pleading and procedural technicalities of an earlier day
should not stand in the way of an accused raising as a defence the fact that he
has been previously acquitted of the offence with which he now stands charged.
The proper procedure in summary conviction matters is not to raise the special
plea of autrefois acquit, but simply to enter a general plea of not
guilty embracing the concept of res judicata. Technically, such a
general plea is not one of autrefois acquit but, as Lord Goddard was
moved to say in Flatman v. Light, supra at p. 419, “…that does not
matter”. The court gives effect to the broad maxim, nemo debet bis vexari
pro una et eadem causa. The charge has been dismissed by a court of
competent jurisdiction and the accused shall not be charged again with the same
matter.

Criminal Code Provisions

The foregoing discussion has been concerned with
the plea of autrefois acquit at common law. What concerns the Court in
large measure in this appeal, however, are special statutory provisions found
in the Criminal Code  and their effect. I turn then to the Code.

The first reference should be to ss. 534 to 537
inclusive, coupled with s. 502. Section 535(1) provides specifically that
an accused may plead the

[Page 390]

special plea of (a) autrefois acquit, (b)
autrefois convict, and (c) pardon. The Code provides
further that the pleas shall be disposed of by the judge without a jury before
the accused is called upon to plead further. Sections 534 to 537 are found in
Part XVII of the Code, headed “Procedure by Indictment”, and this has
given rise to the argument that the special pleas are not available in respect
of summary conviction offences, provision for which is contained in Part XXIV
of the Code.

1 do not think this submission can prevail.
Something akin to the plea of autrefois acquit was available at common
law to a defendant accused of an offence punishable by summary conviction. That
being so, it would take language other than that found in ss. 534 to 537 to
manifest an intent on the part of Parliament to take away such defence. The Code
does not contain all the criminal law and Part XXIV does not contain all of
the law relating to summary convictions. No authority is needed for the
proposition that common law rights are not to be held to be taken away or
affected by statute unless such an intent is made manifest by clear language or
necessary implication. In the absence of irreconcilable conflict, full effect
should be given to both common law and statute. Section 7(3) of the Code expressly
continues in force every rule and principle of the common law that renders any
circumstance a defence to a charge, except in so far as altered by, or
inconsistent with, the Code or any other act of Parliament. Thus, while
the special plea of autrefois acquit is not mentioned in the summary
conviction provisions of the Code, one would have to take an unduly
technical and narrow interpretation of that objection and ignore the common law
of Flatman and Weymss in order to accept the position urged by
the Crown.

Part XXIV of the Code contains two
sections, 734 and 743, which, for ease of reference, I will set out below:

[Page 391]

734. Where, in proceedings to which this
Part applies, the defendant appears for the trial and the prosecutor, having
had due notice does not appear, the summary conviction court may dismiss the
information or may adjourn the trial to some other time upon such terms as it
considers proper.

743. (1) Where the summary conviction court
dismisses an information it may, if requested by the defendant, draw up an
order of dismissal, and shall give to the defendant a certified copy of the
order of dismissal.

(2) A copy of an order of dismissal,
certified in accordance with subsection (1) is, without further proof, a
bar to any subsequent proceedings against the defendant in respect of the same cause.

The Code is clear in providing that
where, as here, the defendant appears for the trial and the prosecutor does not
appear, the summary conviction court may dismiss the information. It is then
open to the defendant to request the court to draw up an order of dismissal, a
certified copy of which, without further proof, is a bar to any subsequent
proceedings against him in respect of the same cause. No certificate was
requested in the present case. It is the position of the Crown that failure to
obtain a certificate is fatal to the position of the defendant. The Crown
relies on the argument, reflected in the first question upon which leave to
appeal was granted, that s. 743  supplants the common law right to raise
the special plea of autrefois acquit in a summary conviction court. The
effect of the argument is that a successful defendant must obtain a certificate
of dismissal at the time of trial, failing which he has no protection from a
second information. Nothing in the language of the Code leads to that
conclusion. Section 743  is intended in my view to supplement, and not to
supplant, common law rights. It is in aid, rather than in derogation, of those
rights. The certificate affords a mechanism, borrowed from English statute law
of some antiquity, facilitating proof of dismissal of an information.

Section 743  only deals with an order of
dismissal and the effect of a certified copy of that order. It is, at the very
least, implicit in that section that every dismissal for failure of the
prosecutor to appear will be a bar to subsequent proceedings. As

[Page 392]

Friedland points out in his book, at p. 57,
that section can hardly be a “complete code applicable to summary
proceedings in place of the special pleas spelled out for indictable offences…
because, for one reason, no provision is made for a previous conviction”. In
that author’s view, with which I agree, all that s. 743  does “is to allow
the accused to prove his defence by means of a certified copy of the order of
dismissal—a procedure which would probably not be available to him at common
law”. In R. v. Cooper, supra, the narrow, and in my opinion mistaken,
view was taken that the pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois
convict were retained only in respect of a trial upon indictment and that,
in summary conviction matters, the only method of raising the question of res
judicata was by recourse to s. 743 .

With respect to the failure of a defendant to
obtain a certified copy of a certificate of dismissal, it is worth noting that
in The Queen v. Hutchins[14], Lush
J., speaking of a certificate of dismissal under s. 14 of 11 & 12
Vict:, c. 43, said, p. 65:

Now I am of opinion that the first decision
was binding on the local board. It is true that the appellant had not obtained
a written certificate of dismissal, but that is not of the essence. I take the
written certificate to be an artificial but convenient mode of proving the
dismissal provided by the Act, but not necessary to the validity of the
decision pronounced. I should compare it to the convenient mode of proving a
previous conviction by a certificate signed by the clerk of assize. Here the
notebook of the magistrates was produced shewing the summons, the names of the
parties, the nature of the complaint, the hearing, and the decision that the
summons was dismissed on the ground that the street in question was a highway.

The policy of Parliament seems plain. An
information may be dismissed on non-appearance of the prosecutor, and the
defendant is then in a position to obtain a certificate securing him from
further proceedings for the same offence. The granting of a certificate is in
the nature of an administrative act recording the judgment of the summary con-

[Page 393]

viction court. It is not a
judicial act, as Lord Campbell C.J. said in Hancock v. Somes[15], the headnote of which case reads:

The granting a certificate of dismissal,
under section 27. of the 9 Geo. 4. c.31, is a ministerial, and not a
judicial act; and a magistrate having heard a charge of assault and dismissed
such charge, on either of the grounds stated in that section, is bound to grant
a certificate, stating the fact of such dismissal.

Such certificate, though not applied for
and not drawn up in the presence of the parties, is a good defence, under
section 28, to an action for the assault.

Finally, on this point, I agree with Haddad
J.A., of the Alberta Appellate Division, as to the “effectiveness and
convenience afforded by a certificate of dismissal” and with his view that
s. 743  imposes no limitation as to the time for drawing up the order of
dismissal. With respect, I disagree with the opinion of Limerick J.A.,
expressed in R. v. Myshrall[16], that
request for an order of dismissal must be made at trial as the magistrate, functus
officio, cannot draw up or certify an order of dismissal thereafter. A rule
limiting the protection of s. 743  to those who request at trial that an
order of dismissal be drawn up would work a grave hardship on the many
defendants who appear without counsel and are ignorant of s. 743 of the Code.

On the Merits

In some circumstances, it may be difficult to
say whether the defendant has, indeed, been “bis vexatus”; for example,
where an information has been withdrawn or dismissed on technical grounds, or,
the Crown contends, as in the case at bar, where there was no disposition “on
the merits”. It will be recalled that the second question upon which leave to
appeal was granted raises the issue of whether the information was dealt with
“on the merits”.

I am not at all certain of what is meant by the
term “on the merits”, or indeed whether the ter-

[Page 394]

minology of “on the merits” furthers in any way
our understanding of the effect of the dismissal of an information. Section 734
specifically empowers the summary conviction court to dismiss upon
non-appearance of the prosecutor. Again we face Cooper and Osborne. Johnson
J.A. in the former case held that “on the merits” necessarily meant after a
“trial”, i.e. by the terms of s. 739, after the court “had heard
the prosecutor, defendant and witnesses” and “after considering the matter”.
Section 739 reads:

When the summary conviction court has heard
the prosecutor, defendant and witnesses it shall, after considering the matter,
convict the defendant or make an order against him or dismiss the information,
as the case may be.

Section 736(3) reads:

Where the defendant pleads not guilty or
states that he has cause to show why an order should not be made against him,
as the case may be, the summary conviction court shall proceed with the trial,
and shall take the evidence of witnesses for the prosecutor and the defendant
in accordance with the provision of Part XV relating to preliminary inquiries.

Section 735(1) reads:

Where the prosecutor and defendant appear,
the summary conviction court shall proceed to hold the trial.

Limerick J.A. in Osborne relied upon
s. 736(3) and the language there of “proceed with the trial” after the
taking of plea, so that:

the trial commences only after the plea has
been taken and initiates with the calling of the first witness or the
introduction of other evidence. The accused is not in jeopardy until all the
evidence of the prosecution has been adduced, the defence has closed its case
and the case is ready to go to the jury or Judge for decision. (p. 410)

Yet, one need only point to s. 735, prior
to any reference to plea, where subs. (1) states: “Where the prosecutor and
defendant appear, the summary conviction court shall proceed to hold the
trial.”

[Page 395]

In Blair and Karashowsky, supra, Clement
J.A. took a view differing from that expressed in Osborne. Mr. Justice
Clement first registered a caveat about the pitfalls of the term “on the
merits”, and then added at p. 53:

When the prisoner has pled, the formalities
are completed, the case is before the Court, the prisoner is in jeopardy, and what
arises thereafter is a matter of the conduct of the trial.

The words of Maule J. in Tunnicliffe v. Tedd[17] at p. 998 are then applicable:

In an ordinary court of oyer and terminer,
if the defendant appears and pleads, he has an undoubted right to have the
matter determined. When the complaint is ripe for hearing, and the defendant is
ready to take his trial, if the prosecutor alleges nothing against him, or
merely something that is unsubstantial, then the magistrates are bound to find
the charge not proved, and to give a certificate accordingly.

Reference might also be made to R. v. Stokes[18], where effect was given to a certificate
of dismissal obtained in a case where no evidence was given for the
prosecution, and an adjournment was refused upon an erroneous view of the
magistrate’s power to adjourn.

In R. v. Church Knowle[19], Coleridge J. held that quashing because
respondents declined going into their case amounted to a decision on the
merits. He said, at p. 551:

Quashing an order for want of form is
different from quashing it merely because the merits are not gone into. If the
order is discharged because the respondents do not choose to enter into their
case, that is a quashing on the merits.

In R. v. Ross, supra, Bull J.A. at pp.
486-7 speaks to like effect:

But it is an entirely different situation
where, after a trial has been started in the sense that an accused has pleaded
and is before the Court, the charge is dismissed whether because there is no
evidence adduced or only

[Page 396]

insufficient or inadequate evidence adduced
by the Crown. I can see no real difference. The charge has not been put aside
or taken away; it has been dismissed and the accused, in my view, is entitled
to a certificate of acquittal.

Returning to Double Jeopardy, Friedland
at p. 54 states his view unequivocally:

If a court exercises its discretion not to
adjourn or to permit the charge to be withdrawn, the resulting dismissal or
acquittal should bar further proceedings. A dismissal in such circumstances
should not differ from a dismissal brought about by the prosecutor deliberately
offering no evidence.

There follows (pp. 57-59) an illuminating
discussion of the origin of the unfortunate phrase “on the merits”. In
nineteenth century England, justices were given power to issue “certificates of
dismissal” with respect to common assaults and batteries. These certificates
served to release the accused “from all further or other Proceedings, Civil or
Criminal, for the same Cause”, an extraordinary legislative provision. In a
couple of cases, (Tunnicliffe v. Tedd, supra, and Vaughton v.
Bradshaw[20]) the
prosecutor chose to drop the criminal proceedings in favour of a civil suit,
yet the certificate barred such a suit. Accordingly, the provision was amended
in 1861 with the addition of the words ‘“upon the merits”. The full effect of
the amendment was made clear in Reed v. Nutt[21], where Lord Coleridge C.J. said,
p. 674, “…the later statute requires a more complete and substantial
hearing of the charge than the earlier one did…”. Despite the absence of such
language in the Code, the post-1861 cases were relied upon in imposing
an “upon the merits” test in decisions like R. v. Commodore Hotel (Windsor)
Ltd.[22], and Burns
v. Gan[23], both
of which are called in aid here by the Crown. The statutory language upon which
Reed v. Nutt rested (24 & 25 Vict. c. 100, s. 44) read: “If the
justices, upon the hearing of any such case of assault or battery upon
the merits…

[Page 397]

shall deem the offence not to be proved…”.
(Emphasis added.)

In R. v. Hatherley[24] (leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada refused, [1971] S.C.R. xi), the Ontario Court of Appeal held (p.
243):

On a subsequent charge in which the serial
number of the saw in question was changed, a plea of autrefois acquit was
accepted, and it is the acceptance of that plea which forms the subject-matter
of this appeal. We think the plea was properly substantiated and that the
appeal fails. We think the accused, once a plea had been entered, was in
jeopardy and that if the Crown elected not then to call any evidence, the
disposition by acquittal was a disposition on the merits of the case.

In the case of Haynes v. Davis[25], an information was preferred against the
appellant for having sold milk which was deficient in natural fat. When the
case came on for hearing the magistrate was informed that no certificate of
analysis had been served with the summons in pursuance of the applicable
legislation, whereupon he dismissed the summons. No evidence of the facts was
given. A second summons was then taken out in respect of the same alleged
offence. The Court held (Lush J. dissenting) that the appellant had been in
peril of being convicted on the first summons and, therefore, entitled to plead
autrefois acquit to the second summons. Ridley J. said, p. 335:

I think he was in peril and therefore that
he was entitled to plead autrefois acquit. The magistrate had
jurisdiction unless objection was taken at the proper time to the informality,
and unless that objection was taken there was a possibility, and indeed a probability,
that the magistrate would proceed to a decision and convict the appellant. The
appellant was thus in peril. It is not quite correct to say, although it is
rather an attractive phrase, that there must have been an acquittal upon the
merits in order that there may be a good plea of autrefois acquit, In
whatever way a person obtains an acquittal, whether it be by the verdict of a
jury on the merits or by

[Page 398]

some ruling on a point of law without the
case going to the jury, he is entitled to protection from further proceedings.
Once there is an acquittal he cannot be tried again for the same offence.

Avory J. had this to say, at p. 337:

I agree, but I prefer to rest my judgment
upon the one ground that the plea of res judicata or autrefois acquit
depends for its validity upon this one question, whether the accused on the
former occasion was in peril of being convicted of the same offence. If he was,
the plea of autrefois acquit is good.

and

The question whether the one or the other
is in peril is to be ascertained by inquiring whether the magistrate had
jurisdiction to deal with the offence.

In my view, a criminal trial commences and an
accused is normally in jeopardy from the moment issue is joined before a judge
having jurisdiction and the prosecution is called upon to present its case in
court. The person accused continues in jeopardy until final determination of
the matter by rendering of the verdict.

Should the accused avail himself of the
certificate provided for in s. 743(1), subs. (2) bars any subsequent
proceedings in respect of the same cause, without reference to the events
giving rise to the dismissal. In principle, there is no reason why a different
situation ought to prevail where the defendant has not obtained the certified
copy. Nor, in principle, is it easy to distinguish between the situation where
the Crown leads evidence which fails to make out a case for the defendant to
answer and the situation where, as here, no evidence is led. So long as the
case has proceeded to a verdict and a dismissal, that should be sufficient. See
R. v. Ecker and Fry[26], at
p. 3, where Chief Justice Latchford said, in a passage adopted by
Taschereau J. in Welch v. R.[27], at
p. 417:

This Court was of opinion that “in jeopardy
twice”—the bis vexari of the legal maxim—has not the meaning of
subjection twice to a trial for the same offence except in cases where the
first trial has been concluded by an adjudication or judgment declaring the
accused acquit-

[Page 399]

ted or convicted. Not otherwise could the
plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict prevail.

The term “on the merits” does nothing to further
the test for the application of the bis vexari maxim. There is no basis,
in the Code or in the common law, for any super-added requirement that
there must be a trial “on the merits”. That phrase merely serves to emphasize
the general requirement that the previous dismissal must have been made by a
court of competent jurisdiction, whose proceedings were free from
jurisdictional error and which rendered judgment on the charge.

Speaking generally, it is not readily apparent
why the Crown should have the right to decline to adduce evidence in support of
its charge and then assert the irrelevance of a dismissal consequent thereon,
or why the Crown should be enabled to avoid the effect of refusal of an
adjournment by declining to lead evidence and laying a fresh information
following dismissal of the first charge. It is the intent of the Code that
summary conviction matters be disposed of with despatch. No good purpose is
served by introducing unwarranted complexities into what are, or should be,
simple and straight-forward and expeditious procedures.

In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Three persons convicted on
charge of murder—Joint trial—Errors by trial judge with respect to use of
extrajudicial statements of accused—Overwhelming evidence implicating
appellant—Application of provisions of Criminal Code , s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

The appellant was one of three persons
charged and convicted of the non-capital murder of David Perry in the City of Winnipeg after a trial by judge and jury
and all of whom were thereupon sentenced to life imprisonment. The conviction
was confirmed by a majority of the Manitoba Court of Appeal; O’Sullivan J.A.
dissenting would have ordered new and separate trials. The appellant then
appealed to this Court pursuant to s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  on the basis of a dissent in the Court of Appeal on a question of law.

The certificate of the Court of Appeal set
out 12 grounds of dissent, the first three of which were as follows: “1. The
learned trial judge erred in inviting the jury to compare and contrast the
confessions of the appellant with the confessions of his co-accused, to test
the validity of the confessions of the appellant. 2. The learned trial judge
erred in inviting the jury to consider the statements of the appellant’s
co-accused, which were inadmissible as against the appellant, in considering
the credibility of the appellant. 3. The learned trial judge erred in
permitting the appellant to be asked, during his cross-examination, to comment
on the veracity of his co-accused in connection with their confessions and to
comment on the veracity of other witnesses.”

The majority reasons in the Court of Appeal
came to the same conclusion as the dissent with respect to the first three
grounds of dissent but applied s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code and
dismissed the appeal.

Held (Laskin
C.J., Spence and Estey JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: Having regard to the
overwhelming evidence

[Page 322]

implicating the appellant in the murder of
which he was convicted, the Court of Appeal was satisfied that this was a case
in which, in spite of the errors of the trial judge referred to in the
judgments below, there was no “substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice” and
the provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code were
properly applicable. There was no error in law in the majority judgment of the
Court of Appeal.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Estey JJ., dissenting: The use of the confessions by
the co-accused against the appellant was a fundamental violation of the rule
against the admission of hearsay evidence and a gross exception to or expansion
of the exception from the general prohibition which is unrecognized in the law.
(Schmidt v. R., [1945] S.C.R. 438.)

The jury was not protected against misuse of
the extrajudicial statements by proper instructions, but conversely was invited
to analyse each statement in the light of the contents of the other two
statements as though each were evidence against the appellant. In this appeal,
it was evident from hindsight that the problem of misuse of confessions would
have been avoided by separate trials. But the exposure of the question to
hindsight was not the answer. There was nothing to indicate any error on the
part of the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion on the question of
separate or joint trials. The problem began with the improper use of the
statements of the co-accused in the cross-examination of the appellant,
continued in improper addresses to the jury, and culminated in instructions to
the jury by the trial judge concerning the comparison of the various statements
made by the co-accused.

A serious and fundamental error of law was
committed, and one could not be certain that in the absence of this repeated
error a jury properly instructed would necessarily have reached the same
conclusion with reference to the appellant. Therefore, in these circumstances,
and on the basis of past decisions of this Court on the question of the proper
application of the curative powers granted under s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  (or its predecessor), that subsection could
not be invoked and the conviction therefore should not stand. Dissent on the
issue of the application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) in an appellate court
is dissent on a question of law which can therefore be reviewed by this Court.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Manitoba[1],
dismissing, by a majority, appeals by the appellant and two others from their
conviction of non-capital murder. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J., Spence and
Estey JJ. dissenting.

D’Arcy McCaffrey, Q.C., for the
appellant.

J.G. Dangerfield, for the respondent.

The reasons of Laskin C.J. and Spence and Estey
JJ. were delivered by

ESTEY J. (dissenting)—The appellant was
one of three persons charged and convicted of the non-capital murder of David Perry
in the City of Winnipeg after a trial by judge and jury and all of whom were
thereupon sentenced to life imprisonment. The conviction was confirmed on
appeal by a majority of the Manitoba Court of Appeal (reasons given by Freedman
C.J.M., concurred in by Guy, Monnin and Matas JJ.A.; O’Sullivan J.A. dissenting
would have ordered new and separate trials). The other two persons charged and
convicted who have not appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeal were Kizyma
and Puffer. The appellant McFall now appeals to this Court pursuant to
s. 618(1) (a) on the basis of a dissent in the Court of Appeal on a
question of law.

The certificate of the Court of Appeal sets out
the grounds of dissent:

1. The learned trial judge erred in inviting the
jury to compare and contrast the confessions of the appellant with the
confessions of his co-accused, to test the validity of the confessions of the
appellant.

2. The learned trial judge erred in inviting the
jury to consider the statements of the appellant’s co-accused, which were
inadmissible as against

[Page 324]

the appellant, in considering the credibility of
the appellant.

3. The learned trial judge erred in permitting
the appellant to be asked, during his cross‑examination, to comment on
the veracity of his co-accused in connection with their confessions and to
comment on the veracity of other witnesses.

4. The learned trial judge erred in failing to
instruct the jury that, where two or more persons conspire together to commit
robbery and to use violence in the course of the robbery, and death results
from the use of violence by one or more of the co-conspirator(s), a conspirator
is guilty of murder only if the bodily harm that resulted in death was of a
type that was within the scope of the common enterprise.

5. The learned trial judge erred in refusing a
motion for the severance of the trials.

6. The learned trial judge erred in failing to
rule inadmissible the extra-judicial statement made by the accused, McFall.

7. The learned trial Judge erred in excluding
from the jury the theory of the defence of the appellant, that the deceased was
a homosexual and that the deceased had invited one of the co-accused to his
room to engage in homosexual activity, for which the co-accused was to be paid.

8. The learned trial Judge erred in failing to
instruct the jury properly on the meaning of the word “steal” in the criminal
law.

9. The learned trial Judge erred in failing to
instruct the jury properly on the meaning of the word “wilfully.”

10. The learned trial Judge erred in admitting
evidence of appellant’s previous bad character in the form of a conversation
relating to appellant’s previous dealings with homosexuals.

11. The learned trial judge erred in failing to
instruct the jury that they could believe the

[Page 325]

accused guilty of some crime other than murder
or manslaughter, such as aggravated assault.

12. The Section 613(1) (b)(iii) of the
Criminal Code  should not be applied in order to dismiss the appeal.

The majority reasons in the Court of Appeal came
to the same conclusion as the dissent with respect to the first three grounds
of dissent but applied s. 613(1) (b)(iii) and dismissed the appeal.
The Chief Justice expressed his views on these errors in this way:

Growing out of the contention just considered is
a submission that there was error in the course of the trial in Crown counsel
using the statements of Puffer and Kizyma in the cross‑examination of
McFall. I agree that there was error. If Puffer’s statement is not admissible
against McFall he should not be confronted with it on cross-examination. So too
with Kizyma’s statement. To me this looks too much like getting in the back
door what one can’t get in through the front door. But what was the effect of
the error? As I read the evidence no prejudice to the accused resulted from the
course taken. Indeed it enabled McFall to whittle down, or at least to try to
whittle down, some of the damaging assertions contained not only in his
statement but in those of the others.

There is also a contention that Crown counsel
erred in inviting the jury to make a comparison between the statement of the
three accused—thus asking them to compare admissible evidence with inadmissible
evidence. I agree that the course taken was wrong. But the learned trial Judge
in his charge to the jury made it plain that (1) the addresses of counsel were
not evidence and were not to be treated as such; (2) the jury were to take
their law from him alone; (3) the case of each accused was to be considered and
judged separately from the others; and (4) the statement to the police of each
accused was not evidence against the other two

[Page 326]

accused and was not to be treated as such. That
in my view would very much lessen, if indeed it did not entirely eliminate, the
possible damaging effect of Crown counsel’s suggestion.

…

That there were errors in the trial—some above
referred to, others more minor in character—I do not deny. A perfect record
rarely emerges in a criminal trial. But the learned trial Judge’s handling of
the trial was scrupulously fair. Such error as crept in did not, in my view,
result in any “substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice”. Applying the
provisions of Sec. 613(1) (b)(iii) I would dismiss the appeal.

O’Sullivan J.A., discussing the three individual
extra-judicial statements by the co-accused which were introduced in evidence
by the Crown, stated:

These confessions, while partly implicating
their authors, all offered explanations which if accepted by a jury might
reduce the author’s participation to something less than murder. Each
confession sought to throw a large share of the blame on the other accused.

…

…Crown counsel adopted at the trial a course of
action which, although on reflection it was extraordinary, was acquiesced in by
the presiding judge and by counsel for each of the accused. Crown counsel took
the three confessions and he compared and contrasted them. He did so through a
cross-examination of the accused McFall who took the witness stand after his
confession had been ruled voluntary. He did so in the course of a detailed
speech to the jury. He invited the jury to look at each statement side by side
with the other confessions and to infer from them—from their similarities and
from their differences—and from their consist-

[Page 327]

ency or inconsistency with the physical facts—to
infer from them what happened on the night in question.

…

In my opinion, it was a serious error for Crown
counsel to invite the jury thus to compare and contrast the confessions.

…

Having come to the conclusion that there were a
number of serious errors in the course of the trial, I am satisfied that the
verdict is not one that twelve persons properly instructed would necessarily
have come to.

It is apparent that these extrajudicial
statements made by the three accused were the subject of extensive use in
cross-examination of the accused, were mentioned in addresses to the jury by
both counsel for the co-accused and the Crown, and by the Court in charging the
jury. In all these instances, these three statements were compared and
cross-checked so that the statements of the co-accused were repeatedly
presented as though admissible against the appellant for any and all purposes
in the same manner as his own statement. The impact on the jury was heightened
by the fact that the appellant alone of the three accused entered the witness
box and as will be seen from the excerpts quoted below, counsel for the
co-accused Kizyma and Crown counsel put to the appellant the statements of the
two co-accused and challenged the appellant for explanation of differences
between the three statements. The following are excerpts from the
cross-examination of the appellant by counsel for one of the co-accused:

Q. When you entered the room with
Mr. Puffer, didn’t you say ‘We’re with the R.C.M.P. Special Police.’?

A. No, Sir.

Q. Mr. Kizyma said you said that.

A. I never said it.

Q. Mr. Kizyma said you said, ‘We heard
that you brought some heroin to Winnipeg.’?

A. I never said that.

[Page 328]

Q. David said ‘no’.

A. I never heard.

Q. So Mr. Kizyma is lying again?

A. Uh-huh.

Q. Then Mr. Kizyma said you slapped
him and told him he did.

A. I never touched him.

Q. Mr. Kizyma is lying again?

A. (no reply.)

THE COURT: The witness is not answering
your question.

MR. SCHWARTZWALD: I think he had.

THE COURT: I don’t think he did. You are
reading statements that are intended to be questions and not getting an answer.

Q. So Mr. Kizyma is lying when he said
you slapped Mr. Perry and told him that he did bring drugs to Winnipeg?

A. I suppose so he’s lying.

Q. In Mr. Kizyma’s statement he says
he put the pillow on Mr. Perry?

A. Yes.

Q. He’s not lying there, is he?

A. No.

The following is an excerpt from the
cross-examination of the appellant by the Crown Attorney:

Q. I want to refer you to Mr. Puffer’s
statement. As a matter of fact I am suggesting to you what Mr. Puffer said
is accurate, “I went to Allwyn and said, ‘There’s no money.’” Do you remember
Mr. Puffer saying that?

A. No, sir.

Q. “By this time they—Mark and Allwyn were
wrestling David on the floor.” Wasn’t that the truth?

A. No, sir.

Q. So you say that part of
Mr. Puffer’s statement is not true?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. “Mark and Allwyn were wrestling David on
the floor.”, is not true?

A. No, sir.

Q. All right, let us go back to the
statement again. “While I was doing this Kerry went through his suits in the
closet looking for money.” Isn’t that right?

A. No, sir.

[Page 329]

Q. It’s not right?

A. No, sir.

Q. Mr. Kizyma in his statement,
Exhibit 67, said, “Meanwhile Allwyn was saying ‘We’re R.C.M.P. Special
Police.’” You were telling him you were the R.C.M.P. Heroin Squad and he went
on to say about you slapping.

A. No sir, he did not do that.

Q. Then further on in Kizyma’s statement,
“Then he went to get up and I pushed him over the bed, and he landed on the
floor on the other side.” Is that statement true?

A. That I pushed him?

Q. Kizyma said he pushed him.

A. Yes, that was when we entered the room.

Q. “Then he went to get up and I” referring
to Mr. Kizyma, “pushed him over the bed, and he landed on the floor on the
other side.”; is that true?

A. I don’t know where he landed.

Q. He pushed him over the bed?

A. He pushed him, yes.

Q. You told us that already.

A. Yes.

Q. The next sentence in Kizyma’s statement,
“Then Tom,” Mr. Puffer, “came back into the room and I” which means
Kizyma, “went looking for money. I opened the closet door to see if there was
any money inside there but I did not touch none of his suits or his clothing.”;
isn’t that the truth?

A. It might be.

Q. When you say in your statement, again
coming back so we know where we are standing right after the phone was put back
on the hook, “While I was doing this Kerry went through his suits in the closet
looking for money.” That’s the truth, isn’t it?

A. No.

Q. You said Kizyma’s statement might be
true but yours is wrong?

A. If he said he done it, then he done it.

…

Q. False. In Kizyma’s letter, Exhibit 68,
the one he wrote to his parents says, “And I said I couldn’t find any money.
And the guy said he left his wallet in the vault downstairs in the hotel front

[Page 330]

desk.” What do you have to say about that?
Is that true?

A. I don’t know if it is true or not.

THE COURT: What exhibit was that?

MR. NOZICK: I referred to the letter,
Exhibit 68, the one written by Mr. Kizyma to his parents.

BY MR. NOZICK:

Q. You say virtually the same thing in your
statement, don’t you?

A. Yes.

Q. You cannot say whether it was true or
not?

A. He read my statement too.

Q. That is in your statement you gave to
the police, didn’t you?

A. Yes.

Q. Referring you to Mr. Puffer’s
statement, Exhibit 50, and I will read it in context, “Allwyn and Mark were
talking to David. I went to Allwyn and said there’s no money…”; do you recall
that?

A. I recall his coming to me and saying
that.

Q. “By this time they—Mark and Allwyn were
wrestling David on the floor. Allwyn told me to tie his feet and gave me a
belt. I remember tying his feet. Then one of them said ‘Let’s go.’” is that
right?

A. Yes.

Q. You are the one, I suggest to you, that
handed the belt to Mr. Puffer and told Mr. Puffer to tie his feet?

A. No, sir.

Q. So that part of Mr. Puffer’s
statement is not true?

A. If I told Mr. Puffer to jump in the
fire, would he jump in the fire?

Q. I don’t know. He’s your friend.

A. I don’t think he would.

THE COURT: There were several comments put
to the witness in that statement, Mr. Nozick more important than would he
do this or that. I think the witness should be given a more specific
opportunity to refer to your part of the question taken from Puffer’s statement
that suggested that Allwyn gave him the belt and told him to tie his feet.

MR. NOZICK: TO be more specific I tried not
to take the statement out of context.

[Page 331]

BY MR. NOZICK:

Q. I am taking a statement and suggesting
it is true from Mr. Puffer’s statement, “Allwyn told me to tie his feet
and gave me a belt—I remember tying his feet.”; what do you have to say about
that statement?

A. It’s not true.

Q. Then going back to your statement, which
you deny, “Jason was tying his feet with his belt and Kerry was hitting him in
the face and he tied his hands with something behind his back.”; what do you
have to say about that statement?

A. I never told him to tie his hands behind
his back. I asked the police how was his hands tied and they told me.

Q. I am suggesting to you, Mr. McFall,
you were the one that was really quarterbacking this whole scene. You were the
one that was telling everybody else what to do?

A. No, sir.

Q. I am going to read you part of
Mr. Kizyma’s statement, Exhibit 67, and I want you to tell me whether you
agree or disagree with what Mr. Kizyma told the police in this statement,
Exhibit 67. Remember I read you the part, “I opened the closet door to see if
there was any money inside there but I didn’t touch none of his suits or his
clothing.” Do you remember when I asked you that before?

A. Yes.

Q. You told me that might be true, was that
your answer?

A. Yes.

Q. Then it goes on in the next sentence,
“When I came back into the room Tom had David against the wall and Tom threw
him on the ground and punched him.”; do you remember that?

A. No, sir.

Q. He went on, “He went on the ground then
Allwyn was holding him down …”; do you remember that?

A. No, sir.

Q. “And he” referring to you, “told me to
grab his arms, then Allwyn passed Tom the belt and Allwyn said Tie his feet.’”;
do you remember that?

A. No, sir.

[Page 332]

Q. You deny that?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. “David was just laying there and was
saying ‘Oh my God.’”; do you remember that?

A. No, sir.

Q. You don’t remember Mr. Perry
saying, “Oh, my God.”?

A. No, sir.

Q. You don’t remember that?

A. No, sir.

Q. “Then Allwyn passed me the” that is
Mr. Kizyma, “the coffee pot cord and told me to tie his hands up.”; isn’t
that right?

A. No, sir.

Q. “We were going to leave the room then
and Allwyn said ‘Gag him.’”; isn’t that right?

A. No, sir.

Q. You did not say, “Gag him.”?

A. No, sir.

Q. Wasn’t your idea to have Mr. Puffer
tie David Perry’s feet with a belt?

A. No, sir.

Q. It was not your idea to have
Mr. Kizyma tie Mr. Perry’s hands behind his back with the coffee pot
cord?

A. No, sir.

Q. It was not your idea to gag Mr. Perry?

A. No, sir.

Q. You did not play any part in this?

A. No, sir.

Q. Just going back to Mr. Kizyma’s
statement again, Exhibit 67, “So I couldn’t find nothing to gag him with so I
used a pillow and someone threw me his sweater.”; do you remember that?

A. Do I remember hearing or seeing?

Q. Do you remember hearing and seeing?
Mr. Kizyma said this and you tell me if this is true, “So I couldn’t find
nothing to gag with him so I used a pillow and someone threw me his sweater.
Meanwhile Tom and Allwyn were watching …”; is that true?

A. I was out of the room by that time.

Q. So you were not watching Mr. Kizyma
tie the pillow to the face of David Perry?

[Page 333]

A. No, sir.

Q. With the sweater?

A. No, sir.

Q. I am suggesting to you that it was you
that threw the sweater that was used to tie the pillow up, to Mr. Kizyma?

A. No, sir.

Q. Your statement says, “I said ‘Let’s go.’
and Kerry said ‘Wait a minute’ and he tied a pillow to his face.”; what about
that?

A. I don’t remember that.

Q. After this happened in 2701 Northstar
Inn, you left?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Mr. McFall, you recall yesterday I
was asking you whether certain passages in Mr. Kizyma’s statement, or
Mr. Puffer’s statement were true?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember that’s where we were
yesterday. Now I refer you to Mr. Kizyma’s statement which is Exhibit 67,
page 3. Mr. Kizyma says, “Allwyn said to Tom, ‘Look for money.’ Tom ran
around the room looking for money but couldn’t find any.” Now, do you recall
that? Is that correct?

A. I recall you saying it yesterday, yes.

Q. Do you recall that happening in the
room?

A. No, sir.

Q. Do you recall saying to Puffer, “Look
for money.”?

A. No, sir.

Q. Do you recall Puffer running around the
room looking for money?

A. No, sir.

Q. I refer you to Mr. Puffer’s
statement, Exhibit 50, where he says at Page 3, “We walked in and Allwyn or
Mark said ‘Search for money.’ So here I am looking in the drawers and that.” Do
you recall that happening?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you say, “Look for money.”?

A. No, sir.

Q. Or search for money?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did Kizyma say, “Search for money.”?

A. No, sir.

[Page 334]

Q. Do you recall Mr. Puffer looking in
the drawers?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you throw the mattress on top of
Mr. Perry?

A. No, sir.

Q. Again, I refer you to Exhibit 67,
Mr. Kizyma’s statement.

THE COURT: Would you slow down when you are
referring to these various statements, please, Mr. Nozick. I’m having
trouble with all the documents that are here, finding the exhibit first and
then the place you’re referring to.

MR. NOZICK: Yes. Perhaps I should give the
page number. It might be of some assistance.

BY MR. NOZICK:

Q. At page 4 of Mr. Kizyma’s
statement, Mr. Kizyma said, “Then Allwyn threw the mattress over him, then
we all left the room.” Do you remember that happening?

A. No, sir.

Q. And in his letter to you he says, “Okay,
we all agreed to roll him.” Do you remember that statement in the letter?

A. Yes.

Q. That was correct, wasn’t it?

A. Pardon me?

Q. That was correct, wasn’t it?

A. No, sir.

Q. No. And he told you in his letter, “I’m
willing to say you didn’t do nothing but Tom’s got to work this out himself.”
Do you remember that in the letter?

A. Yes.

Q. So it appeared from the letter that was
written to you, or the letter that was sent to you, that Mr. Kizyma was
going to try and cover up for you?

A. I wouldn’t say he was trying to cover
up.

Q. No?

A. I never asked him to cover up.

Q. Well, he says in his letter, “Okay, I’m
the one that’s going to get the time. Now, Tom, he should get a little time.
Now you—I’m going to try and cover up for you. In other words, I’m going to say
you didn’t do fuck all.” Do you remember that?

A. That’s in the letter. It also says in
the letter which I didn’t.

Q. Pardon?

[Page 335]

A. It also says which I didn’t.

Q. Exhibit 67, please. Page 4, my lord, of
Exhibit 67. Mr. Kizyma made this statement and I want you to tell me if
you agree with it: “Before we left the room, Allwyn took the ashtray and
smashed his glasses.” Do you agree with that?

A. Pardon me?

Q. “Before we left the room Allwyn took the
ashtray and smashed his glasses.”

A. I don’t really recall taking an ashtray
and smashing anybody’s glasses.

Q. And then he says, “Tom hit him in the
head with his fist pretty hard.” Do you remember that?

A. He might have done it.

Q. Well, wasn’t that when you were talking
about waving your hand, “You know that you hit him. Why don’t you admit it?”
And he said, “All right. So I hit him but only once.”

A. The only time I knew that Tom hit him
was when he was talking in the Fort Garry Courts.

Q. I notice in Exhibit 70 that Mr. Kizyma
starts his letter off as follows: “Allwyn, I will write that letter to your
parents but I want to straighten a couple of things out first.” That would seem
to indicate that you had had a conversation?

A. Yes, I did, yes.

Q. A conversation about covering up for
yourself?

A. No, sir.

Crown counsel in his address to the jury recited
the three statements of the accused and invited the jury to compare them one to
the other thereby to discern the truth. The habit thus formed infected the
charge to the jury as well. The learned trial judge included the following
summary of the appellant’s testimony in his charge:

He says that Perry was not unconscious; he was
talking. He denies that he said that they were from the R.C.M.P. or suggesting
that Perry bought heroin; says where those statements appear in Kizyma’s
statement, Kizyma is lying.

[Page 336]

He says he didn’t slap Mr. Perry and if
Kizyma says that, Kizyma is lying. He says Kizyma is not lying, however, where
he said about putting the pillow on. He agreed that his statement to the
police, that is, McFall’s statement to the police, was correct to a certain
extent.

…

He said, No, it’s not true if Kerry said they
were going to the Mardi Gras.

…

Said what Puffer said in his statement that
“Mark and he, Allwyn, were wrestling David on the floor” was not true. He said
yes, he did smash the glasses. He didn’t know why; yes, he used the ashtray to
smash the glasses. He did put the phone on the hook. He said he didn’t remember
seeing Puffer do anything; that he doesn’t remember saying to the police that
Jason jumped on the man and was holding him by the throat. He says it’s not
true that Kerry went through the suits looking for money; denies Kizyma’s
statement saying that he’d slapped the deceased. He said with respect to his
own statement it’s not true. He didn’t say it.

…

Referred to Puffer’s statement, he said, “No, I
did not tell him to tie his feet and hand him the belt.” He denies what Kizyma
says in his statement that he was telling others to do this and that. He denies
he passed the cord for tying the arms. He denies that he said, “Gag him.” He
said, no, it was not his idea to have Kerry tie him and gag him. He said it’s
not true that he was watching Kizyma tie the pillow to his face. He says, no,
he did not throw the sweater to Kizyma.

…

In the latter part of his cross examination he
was referred to a portion of Kizyma’s statement. He says, “No, I don’t really
recall taking the ashtray and smashing anybody’s glasses.”

[Page 337]

The learned trial judge discussed the three
statements made by the three co-accused, in his charge as follows:

As you recall it was originally my intention to
remove from the statements the names of other accused mentioned in the
statements, however, as those names have been used to a large extent in the
examination and cross examination of McFall, it is now necessary to leave the
names in the statements so that you can make a comparison of what McFall has
denied with some of the suggestions in those other statements. If the names had
not been referred to or if none of the accused had testified, removal of the
names would have made it easier for you to exclude all inadmissible evidence
from your mind. All I can now do is urge you again in reading the statements to
remember, for example if Kizyma says that Puffer did something or other, you
may consider that evidence with respect to Kizyma because it may indicate his
knowledge of what was going on but you can not use that evidence against
Puffer. That is just one example to indicate and to caution you, again, that
evidence in the statements is evidence against the person who made the
statement and not against any other accused.

I say the only exception to that general rule is
that you may look at names in other statements with respect to McFall in
company with what he said in the stand in trying to decide on his general
truthfulness or credibility.

The Court then invited the jury to examine these
statements in accordance with his instructions:

I now wish to review briefly the statement of each
accused as much for the manner of the way I suggest you look at them as
anything else.

You take McFall’s statement to see what he says
he did and nothing else.

[Page 338]

Such use of the statements by the co-accused
against the appellant was, of course, an error of law, a fundamental violation
of the rule against the admission of hearsay evidence and a gross exception to
or expansion of the exception from the general prohibition which is
unrecognized in the law. (Schmidt v. The King)[2]. A succinct condemnation of such use of
extrajudicial statements by co-accused was made by Brennan J. in Bruton v.
U.S.[3], at
p. 135:

Such a context is presented here, where the
powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands
accused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the
jury in a joint trial. Not only are the incriminations devastating to the
defendant but their credibility is inevitably suspect, a fact recognized when
accomplices do take the stand and the jury is instructed to weigh their
testimony carefully given the recognized motivation to shift blame onto others.
The unreliability of such evidence is intolerably compounded when the alleged
accomplice, as here, does not testify and cannot be tested by cross-examination.

Here of course the jury was not protected
against misuse of these statements by proper instructions, but conversely was
invited to analyse each statement in the light of the contents of the other two
statements as though each were evidence against the appellant. This leads one
naturally to query the wisdom of joint trials where the existence of such
statements made by all the co-accused is known in advance. The economies and
the efficiencies of joint trials and the advantage of minimizing inconsistent
and unsatisfactory verdicts which expose the law and the courts to criticism by
the public, attract the trial courts to the undertaking of joint trials in such
circumstances. In doing so, the court takes on the added and heavy burden of
complete and proper instruction to the jury on the precise limits of the
evidence admissible against each of the accused, and hence the limited use to
which these statements may be put. This burden is discharged only by the
clearest instruction to the jury that only the statement made by the accused
himself is admissible

[Page 339]

against him, and his statement in turn is
inadmissible against his co-accused. There is in these circumstances a constant
risk because any instruction short of the foregoing will jeopardize and may
destroy any chance of a fair and proper trial. Professor Glanville Williams has
commented on the practice of joint trials:

One wonders whether judges do not welcome
the fact that the joint trial offers an escape from the rigid rules of
evidence.

(Glanville Williams, Proof of Guilt, (3rd
ed.) 1968, p. 249)

The relaxation referred to is of course the
admissibility in the joint trial of all statements of all accused. The rule of
evidence perhaps referred to as “rigid” in the above quotation is the prohibition
against the use of an extra-judicial statement against persons other than the
maker. Joint trials of course do not reduce the application of this rule. The
learned author continues:

The theory of the joint trial is that even
though evidence may be given in the course of the trial that is in law
admissible against one defendant only, justice is done by the judge directing
the jury to erase this evidence from their minds in considering the other
defendants. The simple faith that the jury are able to follow this direction,
compartmentalising their minds in respect of each of the accused, is curiously
inconsistent with the effort made by other rules of law to prevent the jury
coming to know of evidence that may be misleading. If the justification of part
of the law of evidence is that the jury cannot be trusted to hear certain types
of evidence, they do not become trustworthy merely because there is also
another defendant in the dock. (p. 249)

Recognizing all the risks of the practice of
joint trials, the law gives to the trial judge the discretion of determining in
the circumstances of each case whether a joint trial may be undertaken. Unless
there be a clear indication that such discretion has been exercised on some
wrong notion or in the face of circumstances which made the prospect of a fair

[Page 340]

trial unlikely, an appellate tribunal will not
interfere. In this appeal, it is evident from hindsight that the problem of
misuse of confessions would have been avoided by separate trials. But the
exposure of the question to hindsight is not the answer. The law contemplates a
joint trial in these circumstances and has prescribed the proper mode of
instructing the jury in accordance with the applicable law of evidence.
Whatever error may have ensued, nothing appears from the record to indicate any
error on the part of the learned trial judge in the exercise of his discretion
on the question of separate or joint trials. Indeed, the trial judge did
instruct the jury at one point that a statement made by an accused to public
authority was not to be taken into account when dealing with the case of a
co-accused who was not the maker of the statement in question. The problem
began with the improper use of the statements of the co-accused in the
cross-examination of the appellant, continued in improper addresses to the
jury, and culminated in instructions to the jury by the trial judge concerning
the comparison of the various statements made by the co-accused. The Chief
Justice, speaking for the majority of the Court below with respect to the
decision of Hamilton J. not to sever the trials, stated: “In my view there were
no adequate grounds for such interference in the present case,” and I with
respect agree with this conclusion.

We are then left with the conflict below as to
the application of the curative powers of s. 613(1) (b)(iii). This
Court has had occasion in the past to consider its position when faced with an
appeal from a decision in the Court of Appeal below on the question of the
proper application of the powers granted under s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code  (or its predecessor). In Brooks v. The King[4], this Court declined to apply the curative
powers in what is now s. 613(1) (b)(iii), and set aside a dismissal
of appeal by the Court of Appeal of Ontario who had applied the section in

[Page 341]

dismissing an appeal from conviction. See also Stein
v. The King[5], where
this Court again affirmed the power to consider the correctness of the
application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) (s. 1014(2) as it then was) of the
Criminal Code  in the Court of Appeal.

The issue next came before this Court in Lizotte
v. The King[6] where
this Court unanimously allowed an appeal, rejected the application of
s. 613(1) (b)(iii), and directed a new trial. Cartwright J., as he
then was, writing on behalf of the Court, stated at p. 137:

The view that this court exercises its own
judgment as to whether or not it can be said that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred, I think, appears not only from the two
cases last cited but also from Boulianne v. The King, [1931] S.C.R. 621,
and Schmidt v. The King, [1945] S.C.R. 438, in both of which this court
gave effect to the argument that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
had occurred, and dismissed the appeals, and from Chap-delaine v. The King, [1934]
S.C.R. 53, in which this court allowed the appeal, refusing to give effect to
the argument that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred.

In the course of his judgment His Lordship
considered the question of the jurisdiction of this Court with respect to this
section:

One further argument requires
consideration. At the conclusion of his able argument Mr. Dorion submitted
that the jurisdiction of this court in criminal matters being limited to
questions of law and the court appealed from having held that notwithstanding
certain errors in law at the trial there was no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice and that the appeal should be dismissed under the
provisions of section 1014(2)  of the Criminal Code , such decision
cannot be reviewed in this court. It is argued that in reaching the decision to
apply section 1014(2)  the Court of Appeal must of necessity have examined
and weighed the evidence and that consequently such decision is one of fact or
of mixed fact and law and, therefore, not subject to review in this court. It
is urged that the appeal must be dismissed even if this court should be of
opinion that any or all of the points of law argued before us are well taken.

[Page 342]

I do not think that this argument is
entitled to prevail. In the case at bar it might perhaps be disposed of by
pointing out that in my opinion there were serious errors in matter of law at
the trial which the Court of Appeal did not regard as being errors at all; but
even had the Court of Appeal found the existence of all the errors in law which
in my view did occur and nonetheless dismissed the appeal pursuant to
section 1014(2) , I do not think that this court would be without
jurisdiction.

Counsel were not able to refer us to any
reported case in which the argument put forward by Mr. Dorion appears to
have been considered. Its importance is obvious. If given effect it would have
the result that in any case in which a Court of Appeal dismisses an appeal
because in its view, in spite of error in law at the trial, no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred this court could not
entertain, or at all events could not allow, an appeal from such judgment no
matter how grave, in the view of this court, was the error complained of. (pp.
133-4)

In Brown v. The Queen[7] Cartwright J. in giving the majority
judgment on behalf of himself and Locke and Martland JJ.A., refused to follow
the Court of Appeal of Alberta in applying s. 613(1) (b)(iii), but
rather allowed the appeal and directed a new trial. Fauteux J., as he then was,
dissented as he found: “No miscarriage of justice or substantial wrong resulted
therefrom.” Taschereau J. as he then was, also dissented on the ground that he
could find no conflict between the majority judgment and that of the minority
below “on questions of law”. It is not entirely clear whether this dissent is
based upon a disagreement with Cartwright J. when he stated:

With the greatest respect to those who
entertain a different view, it appears to me that when one judge holds that a
passage in the charge to the jury is material and fatally misleading and
another judge holds that the same passage is irrelevant they are in
disagreement on a point of law. (p. 378);

or whether it is a reference to a difference in
the Court below as to the application of what is now s. 613(1) (b)(iii).
In any case, it is clear that the

[Page 343]

majority reversed the Court below on the issue
of the application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

In Colpitts v. The Queen[8], the appeal before this Court was
from a decision of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal where the majority
affirmed a conviction upon the application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
notwithstanding the failure of the trial judge to put the theory of the defence
adequately to the jury. This Court, in reversing the disposition of the Court
of Appeal, declined to apply the section. Spence J., with whom the balance of
the majority concurred, stated with reference to Lizotte v. The King, supra:

In Lizotte v. The King, supra, Cartwright
J. giving the judgment for the Court, held that it was within the jurisdiction
of this Court to allow an appeal and refuse to apply the provisions of the
present s. 592(1)(b)(iii) despite the fact that the Court of Appeal
in the province had dismissed the appeal from the conviction upon the
application of the said subsection. (p. 755)

The dissenting justices would have applied what
is now s. 613(1) (b)(iii) for the reasons given by the majority in
the Court of Appeal. There can be no doubt therefore that all members of the
Court considered the issue of the application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
to be a question of law.

It may be said that the foregoing authorities
are inconsistent with the result reached in The King v. Décary[9].The Court was there concerned with what is
now s. 613(1) (a)(i) and concluded that the dissent in the Court of
Appeal on the question as to whether the verdict was unreasonable was not a
question of law but was rather a question of mixed fact and law. The issue
raised by the two subsections in s. 613 is of course quite different
and in my view the judgment in Décary, supra, is of no assistance in
determining the nature of the point raised in dissent with reference to
s. 613(1) (b)(iii) on this appeal. Similarly, Rozon v. The King[10] was dealing with the issues arising
upon the substitution of a verdict by a court in place of that

[Page 344]

reached by a jury, and the dissent in the Court
of Appeal related to the applicability of a section not related to the
present s. 613.

Finally, we come to Pearson v. the Queen[11], where the majority of the Court of Appeal
dismissed an appeal from conviction notwithstanding a finding of improper
admission of a statement by the accused. The dissent was on the application of
what is now s. 613 in those circumstances. This Court affirmed the
conviction on the basis that the dissent below was founded upon a question as
to whether the sufficiency of evidence supporting the conviction was a question
of fact. Kerwin C.J. stated at p. 372:

There was no dissent on any ground of law
dealt with by the dissenting judge and upon which there was a disagreement in
the Appellate Division and therefore this Court is without jurisdiction: The
King v. Décary [supra]; Rozon v. The King [supra].

The Chief Justice reached this conclusion in a
very short judgment in which no reference is made to any contention that the
applicability of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) is not a question of law and no
consideration was given to the earlier cases of Brook, supra and Stein,
supra. In reaching his conclusion the following excerpt from the dissent in
the Court of Appeal was set forth:

I do not think that the remaining evidence
conclusively establishes the guilt of the accused. I would accordingly quash
the conviction and direct a new trial, (p. 371)

The majority judgment of the Court of Appeal
stated with reference to the evidence remaining after the disputed statement
was set aside:

It is our opinion that quite apart from
this statement there is ample evidence in the sales of grain by him to prove
the offence of theft as charged, and that no injustice has been done to the
accused in the verdict of guilty. Therefore, without arriving at any decision
on the question of admissibility of the statement, we dismiss the appeal, and
affirm the conviction. (p. 31)

The judgment in Pearson v. The Queen, supra, does
not therefore, in my view, squarely deal with

[Page 345]

the issue of jurisdiction now before us. I
therefore conclude from the foregoing line of authorities decided in this Court
since 1927 that the Supreme Court has consistently held the view that it has
jurisdiction to consider the application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) as a
question of law, and that on such an appeal it is open to the Court to reverse
the application or denial of application of this provision of the Code in
the Court below.

This brings the review of the authorities in
this Court down to the judgments of this Court in Dunlop and Sylvester v.
The Queen (pronounced May 31, 1979, and unreported[12]). The Manitoba Court of Appeal had
confirmed a conviction of the accused by the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code. The dissent in the Court of Appeal would have directed a
new trial by reason of an improper direction of the trial judge with respect to
s. 21(1) and s. 21(2) of the Code and would not have applied
s. 613(1) (b)(iii) to either of the errors of law relating to subss.
(1) and (2) of s. 21.

The disposition in this Court of the Dunlop
and Sylvester appeal, supra, was not on the basis of the application
of s. 613 but rather on the basis that it was the error in the jury charge
with respect to s. 21(1), which, in the view of Dickson J., was an error
of law. With respect to this issue Dickson J. refused to invoke s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
in order to allow the conviction to stand. The dissent in this Court dealt
principally with the treatment accorded s. 21(1) by the trial judge in his
instructions to the jury.

Martland J., with whom two justices concurred,
dissented firstly on the ground that the charge under s. 21(1) was
justified from the evidence. In reference to the third ground of appeal which
was that “s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  should not be
applied in order to dismiss the appeal”, Martland J. stated:

I do not think that the third ground constitutes
a dissent on a question of law. Paragraph (iii) of subs. 613(1)(b) gives
to a court of appeal a discretionary power to dismiss an appeal from
conviction, even where there has been a wrong

[Page 346]

decision by a trial court on a question of law
if there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice resulting from
that error. A disagreement by a dissenting judge regarding the exercise of that
discretion is not a dissent on a question of law.

Pratte J. (with whom Beetz J. concurred) joined
with Dickson J. in the disposition of the appeal on the ground that the learned
trial judge had failed to respond to a question posed by the jury with
reference to the meaning of a provision in the Criminal Code . However,
with reference to the s. 613  issue, Pratte J. stated:

The difference of opinion in the Court of
Appeal was solely as to the application of subpara. 613(1)(b)(iii) to
such error [the legality of the charge with reference to s. 21(2)] and I
agree with my brother Martland that this is not a dissent on a question of law.

By reason of these factors, the role and the
interpretation of s. 613 was peripheral and the characterization of that
section in law formed no part of the ratio decidendi of the
majority. Therefore, in the disposition of the appeal now before the Court, I
do not feel bound by the comments in the Dunlop and Sylvester case, supra,
with reference to s. 613. I am strengthened in that view by the fact
that in neither of the judgments to which the references to s. 613 were
made was there any citation of authority or discussion of the above
authorities.

For the reasons stated above with reference to
the misuse of the extrajudicial statements by the co-accused throughout the
trial, first on the cross-examination of the appellant, later in the address of
the prosecution to the jury, and finally in the instructions given by the
learned trial judge to the jury, I have concluded that a serious and
fundamental error of law was committed, and that one cannot be certain that in
the absence of this repeated error a jury properly instructed would necessarily
have reached the same conclusion with reference to the appellant. Section
613(1) (b)(iii) cannot therefore be invoked in these circumstances and
the conviction therefore cannot stand.

In light of my opinion that there must be a new
trial, I do not deal with other evidential issues

[Page 347]

which arose at trial and in the dissent of
O’Sullivan J.A. in the Court of Appeal. I do agree with the interpretation
given by the majority in the Court of Appeal to the decision of this Court in R.
v. Trinneer[13].

I therefore would allow the appeal, set aside
the judgment in the Court of Appeal, quash the conviction of the appellant
McFall, and direct a new trial.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon,
Dickson, Beetz and Pratte JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment prepared for delivery by my brother Estey, but I am
nevertheless not persuaded that this appeal should be allowed. Having regard to
the overwhelming evidence implicating the appellant in the murder of which he
was convicted, the Court of Appeal was satisfied that this was a case in which,
in spite of the errors of the trial judge referred to in the judgments below,
there was no “substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice” and the provisions
of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  were properly
applicable. In my view there was no error in law in the judgment, rendered on
behalf of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba by Chief Justice Freedman, with
which Guy, Monnin and Matas JJ. agreed.

I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEWFOUNDLAND, APPEAL DIVISION

Criminal law—Motor
vehicles—Breathalyzer—Amendment to Code—Breath samples—Whether provision for
“samples” rather than “sample” retroactive—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, ss. 235, 236, 237—Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975, 1974-75-76, (Can.),
c. 93.

Statutes—Amendment—Motor
vehicles—Breathalyzer—Breath samples—Whether provision for “samples” rather
than “sample” retroactive—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34, ss. 235, 236,
237—Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93.

In June 1976, an information was laid by the
R.C.M.P. in Newfoundland against the appellant viz. that he had on April
22, 1976, at St. John’s District, Newfoundland, care or control of a motor
vehicle while having a blood alcohol level in excess of 80 mg. of alcohol in
100 ml. of blood contrary to s. 236  of the Criminal Code . Following
a trial on August 3, 1976 and on May 5, 1977, the appellant was convicted on the latter date. The magistrate had
received in evidence a certificate under s. 237(1)(f) of the Code
in force on April 22, 1976, stating that on the date in question a
sample of appellant’s breath had been received into a Borkenstein
Breathalyzer and indicated a blood alcohol level in excess of the prescribed limit.
The question of law stated was whether the magistrate erred in law in ruling
that the amendments to the Code enacted by the Criminal Law Amendment
Act, 1975, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93, proclaimed May 7, 1976, requiring that
more than one breath sample be received into the breathalyzer and analyzed did
not apply retrospectively to proof of a charge arising on April 22, 1976. While
Noel J. answered the question in the negative and dismissed the appeal, the
Appeal Division reversed and quashed the conviction.

[Page 222]

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Per Pigeon,
Dickson, Beetz, Pratte and Mclntyre JJ.: The amendments in question were
primarily designed to give police officers the right to require more than one
sample of breath from a person suspected of a breach of ss. 234  or 236 . A
comparison of s. 235 as it was before and after amendment indicates that
the amendment related to substantive law. Taking the amendment to s. 235
together with the other amendments it is clear that the prospective character of
s. 235 is determinative of the construction to be placed on the new
s. 237 which cannot be taken to refer to samples that could not have been
legally demanded at the time and that the new s. 237 was intended to apply
only when at least two samples of breath have been legally demanded and
obtained. Further it is apparent that the new s. 237 could not in fact
operate retrospectively. There was no reason to believe that Parliament
intended, when passing the amendments, to allow for an interval during which the
prosecution of offences already committed would be frustrated because the rules
in ss. 235 and 237 would not be available for the enforcement of s. 236 .
Also the statutory rule in s. 36(d) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. I-23, modified the common law by prescribing that the retroactive
operation of procedural enactments shall not be absolute but will take place
only to the extent that the new rules of procedure may be adapted to the
proceedings taken in respect of a matter that has occurred before the new rules
came into effect. Thus the new procedure will not apply retrospectively if or
to the extent that it cannot be adapted. Here the new procedure could not be
adapted and could not apply to a sample taken under the old s. 235. Both s. 36
and the common law therefore constitute insurmountable obstacles to the
conclusion reached by the Appeal Division.

Per Ritchie
and Estey JJ., dissenting: The circumstances in this appeal were that
the appellant was apprehended on April 22, 1976, and required to furnish a
sample of his breath under s. 235 of the Code as it then provided.
The sample indicated a blood alcohol content in excess of the prescribed limit
and had the appellant been charged and tried on the day following his
apprehension, the sample so procured would have constituted prima facie evidence
of his blood content at the time of his apprehension. No information, however,
was laid until June 1, by which time the amendments to the Code had been
proclaimed as law. Not only was the laying of the information delayed but the
trial did not

[Page 223]

commence until August 3, 1976 whereupon it
was adjourned and not concluded until May 5, 1977. The rules of evidence as to
the effect of such a certificate had been amended three months before the trial
commenced and a year before it concluded. The issue turned on whether the
amendment was to be regarded as penal or merely a change in the method of
proof. Morgan J.A. in the Appeal Division rightly concluded that Howard
Smith Paper Mills v. The Queen, [1957] S.C.R. 403 applied. Here as in that
case the amendment neither created an offence nor took away a defence. The only
change was in the mode of proof requiring that before the rebuttable
presumption could arise more than one sample was required. It was Parliament’s
view that a double sampling was necessary to convict and this intention of
Parliament was known in the form of an effective law prior to the laying of the
charge. Different considerations might well have applied had the charge been
laid prior to the date of the amendment.

RITCHIE J. (dissenting)—This is an
appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland allowing an
appeal by the accused from a decision rendered by Mr. Justice Noel in
answering in the negative a query posed by Magistrate Luther arising out of a
case stated by him in relation to the effect of the amendments to s. 237 
of the Criminal Code  of Canada, which were enacted by the Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93, s. 18, requiring that
more than one sample of the breath of a person suspected of a breach of
s. 236 of the Code be received into a breathalizer and analysed by
a technician whose certificate under the above amendment must be based on the
analysis of more than one sample in order to qualify as prima facie evidence
of its contents.

The case stated by Magistrate Luther is in the
following terms:

STATED
CASE

…I do hereby state and sign the following
case for the opinion of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland.

FACTS

1. On the 21st (sic)* day of June, A.D.
1976, an information was laid under oath before a Justice of the Peace in and
for the Province of Newfoundland by Constable D.C. White of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police for ‘that Mohamed Mustapha Ali (DB: 2 NOV 46) of 360 Empire
Avenue, St. John’s, Nfld. on the 22nd day of APR. A.D. 1976, at
St. John’s District, Newfoundland, did unlawfully have the care or control
of a motor vehicle having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion
thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of
blood, thereby committing an offence punishable on summary conviction, contrary
to Section 236  of the Criminal Code  of Canada’.

2. On the 5th day of May, A.D. 1977,
following a trial on the 3rd day of August, A.D. 1976 and the 5th day of
May, A.D. 1977, during which I received in evidence from Constable D.C. White
and marked as an Exhibit ‘D.C.W.1’a Certificate as described in Section
237(1) (f) of the Criminal Code  in force on the 22nd day of April, A.D. 1976,
which Certificate

[Page 225]

stated inter alia that on the date
specified in the Information, namely the 22nd day of April, A.D. 1976, ‘a
sample’ of the breath of the said Mohamed Mustapha Ali, Appellant, was received
into a Borkenstein Breathalyzer Model 900A following which a qualified
technician found that the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the said
Mohamed Mustapha Ali, Appellant, exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood, the said Mohamed Mustapha Ali was convicted by me as
charged in the Information referred to in paragraph 1 of the within Statement
of Facts.

QUESTION
OF LAW

1. Did I err in law in ruling that the
amendments to Section 237  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, enacted by the
Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975, Statutes of Canada 1974‑75-76, Chapter
93, proclaimed in force on the 7th day of May, A.D. 1976 requiring that more
than one sample of the breath of a person suspected of a breach of Section 236 
of the Criminal Code  of Canada be received into a Borkenstein Breathalyzer and
analyzed by a qualified technician within the meaning of the Criminal Code , do
not apply retrospectively to proof of a charge contrary to Section 236  of the
Criminal Code  of Canada arising on the 22nd day of April, A.D. 1976.

DATED at St. John’s this 17th day of May, A.D.
1977.

*should be “1st”.

As the stated case indicates, the circumstances
in the present appeal were that the accused was apprehended on April 22, 1976
in charge of his motor vehicle at which time he was required to furnish a
sample of his breath to the police in an approved breathalizer in accordance
with the provisions of s. 235  of the Criminal Code  as it then
provided. The certificate furnished after analysis of this sample indicated an
alcohol content in the blood of more than 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood and had Mr. Ali been charged and tried on the day
following his apprehension, the sample so procured would have constituted prima
facie evidence of his blood content at the time of his apprehension. No
information, however, was laid against the respondent until June 1st, of the
same year, and in the intervening period the amendment to s. 237  of the Criminal
Code  referred to above was proclaimed as law.

[Page 226]

The effect of the amendment to s. 237  of
the Criminal Code  is discussed in the reasons for judgment of this Court
in R. v. Noble[3], where
it is said, at p. 634:

It is contended on behalf of the appellant
that the combined effect of ss. 235  and 237  of the Criminal Code  as amended
by the Criminal Code Amendment Act 1975, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93, is
that the certificate of a qualified technician based on the analysis of only
one sample of breath, constitutes of itself evidence of the blood
alcohol content of a person charged under s. 236  at the time of the
alleged offence.

I have no doubt that, before the amendment
above referred to, such a certificate was sufficient to create a rebuttable
presumption as to the blood alcohol content of the blood of such a person but
the question here at issue is whether the amendment has had the effect of
requiring the certificate to be based on the analysis of two or more such
samples before it can be acceptable as evidence of its contents without further
proof.

And in concluding the Court said:

…what is at issue here is whether or not a
technician’s certificate based on the analysis of only one sample is, of
itself, without further proof, prima facie evidence of the statements
contained in it and this must depend on whether the rebuttable presumption
accorded to such a certificate by s. 237 , before the amendment, subsists
under the section as amended or whether the new wording requires that the
certificate be based upon two or more analyses before it can be accepted
without further proof of its contents.

The effect of s. 237  both before and
after the amendment is to establish the conditions under which the certificate
of a qualified technician is admissible, without further evidence, as proof of
the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused. These provisions are
obviously designed to assist the Crown in proving its case, and as they serve
to restrict the normal rights of the accused to cross-examination and saddle
him with the burden of proving that the certificate does not accurately reflect
his blood alcohol content at the time of the alleged offence, they are to be
strictly construed and, where ambiguous, interpreted in favour of the accused.

In the present case, not only was the laying of
the information against the respondent delayed for the period which I have
mentioned, but the trial did not commence until August 3, 1976, where-

[Page 227]

upon it appears to have then adjourned and was
not concluded until May 5, 1977. The rules of evidence respecting the effect to
be given to such a certificate as constituting prima facie proof of its
contents had, however, been amended three months before the trial commenced and
a year before it was concluded.

Unlike the case of Noble, the offence in
the present case was allegedly committed before the amendment to s. 237 
had been enacted, but the information was laid and the trial held subsequent
thereto, and the question to be determined is whether a trial held after the
amendment was proclaimed was to be governed by the statutory rules as to proof
which were then in force or whether effect was to be given to the provisions of
a statute which had long since been repealed. It is important to keep in mind
the fact that the amendment in question in no way made any material alteration
in the offence created by s. 236  with which the accused is charged. The
amendment was concerned exclusively with the method of proof and the nature of
the presumption created by the production of the technician’s certificate,
although the penalty was increased.

The proposed amendment had received Royal Assent
on March 30, 1976, but it was
not proclaimed until May 7, 1976, and it is therefore apparent that the Crown
was alerted to the nature of the impending amendment at the time when the
offence was allegedly committed in April. As I have pointed out, no information
was laid until June 1, 1976,
and no trial commenced until the 3rd of August of the same year. There is
nothing in the stated case to indicate the date at which the technician’s
certificate was tendered in evidence and as far as the record is concerned it
may have been at any time up to May 1977; but in any event, it was tendered in
the course of a trial which was governed by the rules of evidence created and
established by the amendment to s. 237 .

The issue raised by this appeal turns upon
whether the amendment in question can be considered as penal in nature or
whether its only effect is to change the method of proof. In this regard I
agree with the passage from the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Morgan
in which he

[Page 228]

concludes that the present circumstances are
governed by the judgment of this Court in Howard Smith Paper Mills v. The
Queen[4]. Mr. Justice
Morgan put the matter thus:

An example of a procedural alteration that
was construed as retrospective may be found in Howard Smith Paper Mills v.
The Queen (1957) 118 C.C.C 321. In that case one of the questions the
Supreme Court of Canada was asked to consider was whether Sec. 41 of the
Combines Investigation Act R.S.C. 1952 Ch. 314 as enacted by 1949 (Second
Session) Ch. 12 section 3 and as amended by 1952 (Can.) c. 39, S8 was
applicable in a prosecution for breaches of that Act which occurred before the
repeal of that section and its reenactment in a slightly different form.
In his reasons for judgment Cartwright J. at p. 337 held that Sec. 41 was
retrospective for the following reasons:

While s. 41 makes a revolutionary
change in the law of evidence, it creates no offence, it takes away no defence,
it does not render criminal any course of conduct which was not already so
declared before its enactment, it does not alter the character or legal effect
of any transaction already entered into; it deals with a matter of evidence
only and, in my opinion, the learned trial Judge was right in holding that it
applied to the trial of the charge before him. (See 1957 S.C.R. 403 at 420.)

These reasons are equally applicable in the
construction of the section with which we are here concerned.

In the present case the appellant contended that
by giving effect to the provisions of the amended section as controlling a
trial which took place after the amendment in relation to an offence alleged to
have been committed prior to its enactment, the Court of Appeal was according
retrospective effect to a penal statute and in this regard reliance was placed
on the reasons for judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. LeSarge[5], in which case the Court was
considering the effect of amendments to the Protection of Privacy Act, 1973-74
(Can.), c. 50, and finding them to be penal in character, ruled against any
retrospective effect being given to them. In the course of the reasons for
judgment which he delivered on behalf of the Court in that case,
Mr. Justice Houlden observed at p. 395:

[Page 229]

There is a well-established principle of
statutory interpretation that penal legislation is ordinarily not to be given a
retrospective effect: 36 Hals., 3rd ed., p. 425, para. 645. On the
other hand, there is an equally well-established principle of statutory
interpretation that a statute which deals with matters of procedure only is
ordinarily to be given a retrospective application: Maxwell, Interpretation
of Statutes, 12th ed. (1969), p. 222. In the present case, the Protection
of Privacy Act does not deal with procedural matters only. Rather,
it creates three new substantive offences, namely: wilful interception of a
private conversation (s. 178.11(1)); possessing, selling or purchasing a device
for surreptitious interception of a private communication (s. 178.18(1)); and
wilful disclosure of information obtained by interception of a private
communication (s. 178.2(1)). Section 178.16 is so inextricably bound up with
the substantive provisions of the Protection of Privacy Act that, in my
opinion, it cannot be given a retrospective operation.

In the present case, as in the case of Howard
Smith the amendment has created “no offence, it takes away no defence, it
does not render criminal any course of conduct which was not already so
declared before its enactment” and I am satisfied that the only change effected
by the amendment was a change in the mode of proof so that the rebuttable
presumption created by the production of a technician’s certificate did not
arise unless more than one sample had been analysed, whereas before the
amendment a technician’s certificate based on only one sample was sufficient to
raise a presumption as to proof of its contents.

The case of R. v. MacGregor[6], was cited on behalf of the Crown as
authority for the contention that the amendment to s. 237  was prospective
and in this regard Mr. Justice Clement, speaking for the majority of the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta observed:

Thus, the three sections operate
together. Section 236  has not been altered in any aspect relevant here, and the
certificate was effective proof, at the time the charge was laid, of the
commission of the offence. Sections 235  and 237  have been altered only to
require more than one sample to be given and dealt with. I cannot discern in
the amendments any intention of Parliament to obliterate the statutory evidence
proving commission of the

[Page 230]

offence, which was effective for the
purpose at the time. In my opinion, the amendments are prospective in
operation, not intended to frustrate the prosecution of offences already committed.
In this I find support in R. v. LeSarge (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 388. I
would dismiss the appeal.

[The italics are my own]

Apart altogether from the complicated
considerations of the correct categorization of this statute as being either
procedural or substantive, there is a much more direct approach to the issue
raised here. Parliament has evidently amended s. 237  by replacing the
right to prove certain matters by one breath sample analysis with an obligation
on the enforcement authorities to make two breath sample analyses as the basis
of proof. It is obvious that in the view of Parliament, the exposure of the
citizen to conviction of a serious criminal offence should not be based on the
risks of error flowing from a single test. Rather it was Parliament’s view that
a double sampling was necessary to complete the process of conviction. This
Parliament had announced in the form of an effective law prior to the laying of
the charge against the respondent. Thus the prosecution, in proving the charge,
must conform to the statute as it existed at the time the charge was laid.
Otherwise the accused is not, in the view of Parliament, to be found guilty of
the offence as charged. Against this clear result brought about by the action
of Parliament prior to the laying of the charge against the appellant, the
subtleties of the Interpretation Act provisions relating to repealed and
amended statutes are of no avail. The guilt or innocence of the accused under
these circumstances must flow directly from the plain meaning of the Code provision
as it existed when the prosecution laid the charge.

Different considerations might well apply if the
charge in the present case had been laid before the date of the amendment, but
as I have pointed out, the information was in fact not laid until three

[Page 231]

weeks after the amendment had been proclaimed
and this circumstance, in my view, serves to distinguish the present case from
that of R. v. MacGregor which in turn was based on the case of R. v.
Bourassa[7].

As I have indicated, I am of opinion that the
amendment here in question was procedural and evidentiary and carried no penal
consequences such as those referred to in the case of R. v. LeSarge.

In view of all the above, I would dismiss this
appeal.

The judgment of Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz, Pratte
and Mclntyre JJ. was delivered by

PRATTE J.—The facts of the case and the question
of law that arises therefrom are as set out in the case that was stated by His
Honour Magistrate Luther for the opinion of the Trial Division of the Supreme
Court of Newfoundland pursuant to s. 762  of the Criminal Code :

FACTS

1. On the 21st day [should read 1st] of
June, A.D. 1976, an information was laid under oath before a Justice of the
Peace in and for the Province of Newfoundland by Constable D.C. White of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police for “that Mohamed Mustapha Ali (DB: 2 NOV 46) of
360 Empire Avenue, St. John’s, Nfld. on the 22nd day of APR. A.D. 1976, at
St. John’s District, Newfoundland, did unlawfully have the care or control
of a motor vehicle having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the
proportion thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood, thereby committing an offence punishable on summary
conviction, contrary to Section 236  of the Criminal Code  of Canada”.

2. On the 5th day of May, A.D. 1977,
following a trial on the 3rd day of August, A.D. 1976 and the 5th day of May,
A.D. 1977, during which I received in evidence from Constable D.C. White and
marked as an Exhibit “D.C.W. 1” a Certificate as described in Section 237(1) (f)
of the Criminal Code  in force on the 22nd day of April, A.D. 1976, which
Certificate stated inter alia that on the date specified in the
Information, namely the 22nd day of April, A.D. 1976, “a sample” of the breath
of the said Mohamed Mustapha Ali, Appellant, was received into a Borken-

[Page 232]

stein Breathalyzer Model 900A following
which a qualified technician found that the proportion of alcohol in the blood
of the said Mohamed Mustapha Ali, Appellant, exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol
in 100 millilitres of blood, the said Mohamed Mustapha Ali was convicted by me
as charged in the Information referred to in paragraph 1 of the within
Statement of Facts.

QUESTION
OF LAW

1. Did I err in law in ruling that the
amendments to Section 237  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, enacted by the
Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975, Statutes of Canada 1974‑75-76, Chapter
93, proclaimed in force the 7th day of May, A.D. 1976 requiring that more than
one sample of the breath of a person suspected of a breach of Section 236  of
the Criminal Code  of Canada be received into a Borkenstein Breathalyzer and
analyzed by a qualified technician within the meaning of the Criminal Code , do
not apply retrospectively to proof of a charge contrary to Section 236  of the
Criminal Code  of Canada arising on the 22nd day of April, A.D. 1976.

By the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975 (Can.),
(23-24-25 Eliz. II, c. 93, “The Amendment Act”) many provisions of the Criminal
Code  were amended or replaced, including ss. 235 , 236  and 237  which are
companion provisions relating to the offence created by s. 236 of driving
a motor vehicle with more than a specified proportion of alcohol in the blood.

The amendments to s, 235 were primarily designed
to give police officers the right to require more than one sample of breath
from a person suspected of a breach of ss. 234  or 236 ; prior to the amendments,
only one sample could be required from a person suspected of having committed
the offence described in s. 234.

Section 236  is the main substantive provision;
it is creative of the offence and while it was amended by the Amendment Act,
it is common ground that the amendments are of no moment for the purpose of
this case.

Section 237  deals essentially with the
conditions under which a certificate of a qualified technician shall constitute
prima facie evidence of its contents as to the proportion of alcohol in
the blood of an

[Page 233]

accused; prior to the amendment, the analysis of
only one sample of breath was a sufficient basis for such a certificate; since
the amendment, the certificate must be based upon not less than two samples
before it may be accepted without further proof of its contents. (See R. v.
Noble[8].)

The Amendment Act was assented to on
March 30, 1976 and it provided that it was to come into force on a day or days
to be fixed by proclamation.

The amendments to ss. 235  and 237  that are
relevant here came into force on April 26, 1976 and May 7, 1976 respectively.

The offence with which the respondent was
charged was allegedly committed on April 22, 1976, after the passing of the Amendment
Act and before the relevant amendments came into effect; however, these
amendments had been proclaimed in force when the charge was laid and when the
trial took place.

The question to be determined is whether the
amendment to s. 237 of the Code requiring that a certificate be
based on not less than two samples of breath (rather than one) is applicable to
an offence against s. 236  that was committed when only one sample was
required, where the charge was laid and the trial took place after the
amendment had come into effect.

His Honour Magistrate Luther, before whom the
trial took place, held that the amendments to s. 237  did not apply
retrospectively and he convicted the respondent of the offence with which he
was charged.

The conviction was appealed to the Supreme Court
of Newfoundland, Trial Division, upon the stated case and the appeal was
dismissed by judgment dated September 8, 1977 (Noel J.).

This judgment was appealed (with leave) to the
Supreme Court of Newfoundland, Court of Appeal, which by a unanimous decision
of February 8, 1978, allowed the appeal, answered the

[Page 234]

question in the affirmative and consequently
quashed the conviction.

The basis of this decision of the Court of
Appeal is found in the following passages of the reasons of Chief Justice
Furlong and of Morgan J.A.; Chief Justice Furlong said:

The nature of the offence with which the
appellant was charged has not been altered by the amendment. The nature of the
evidence which is required to sustain the charge has been varied. Thus it is
impossible to regard the amendment as anything other than procedural in
character. This then brings into operation the exception to the general rule
against retrospection; there is nothing in the amending statute to limit its
applicability to future offences, and I am satisfied that it applies to
offences against S. 236  whenever they occurred.

Morgan J.A., whose reasons were concurred in by
Gushue J.A., expressed the same view as follows:

In my view Sec. 237  is worded generally so
as to operate retrospectively as well as prospectively. It is a procedural
provision providing for the admissibility of evidence before a Court when the
matter is heard. It applies to future hearings after the amending
sections are proclaimed in force and it applies even though the hearing is
in respect of matters that arose before the sections were proclaimed in
force.

The decision of the Court of Appeal is attacked
on several grounds which may be summarized as follows: (a) the relevant
amendments to s. 237 of the Code are not purely procedural in
character and should not therefore, in the absence of any adequate indication
by Parliament, be construed to operate retrospectively and (b) even if the
relevant amendments to s. 237  were purely procedural in character, they
should not be construed to operate retrospectively because Parliament has
clearly expressed its intent to the contrary.

I propose to deal first with this second ground
of attack, assuming therefore—but without deciding—that the Court of Appeal was
correct when it characterized the amendments to s. 237  as purely
procedural.

[Page 235]

It is not in dispute that the rule as to the
retrospective operation of procedural statutes is not absolute; it is only a
guide that is intended to assist in the determination of the true intent of
Parliament which is the main objective of statutory construction. This
presumption in favour of the retrospective operation of procedural enactments
must therefore yield to the contrary intent of Parliament; a procedural statute
shall not be construed retrospectively when Parliament has expressed its
intention to the contrary (see Moon v. Durden[9], per Parke B., at pp. 42 and 43; Kimbray
v. Draper[10], per
Blackburn J., as he then was, at pp. 162 and 163; Republic of Costa Rica v.
Erlanger[11], per
Mellish L.J. at p. 69; Gardner v. Lucas[12], per Lord Blackburn at p. 603.

Given the assumption afore-mentioned, the simple
question for determination is whether Parliament has indicated its intent that
the amendments to s. 237  should operate prospectively only. The language
used by Parliament should first be examined.

The relevant parts of s. 237  as they
existed before (“the old s. 237 ”) and after (“the new s. 237 ”) the Amendment
Act are reproduced hereafter side by side with the amended portions being
emphasized for ease of comparison:

It is apparent that the construction of par. (c)
above cannot be determined without regard to subs. 235(1) to which it refers
specifically. The text of this subsection, both before (“the old s. 235 ”)
and after (“the new s. 235 ”) the Amendment Act is given hereafter
with the amendments being underlined for ease of comparison:

  of his breath suitable to enable an analysis to be made in order to determine

  he may, by demand made to that person forthwith or as soon as
  practicable, require him to provide then or as soon thereafter as is
  practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion of a qualified
  technician referred to in subsection 237(6) are necessary to enable a
  proper analysis to be made in order to determine the proportion, if any, of
  alcohol in his blood, and to accompany the peace officer for the purpose of
  enabling such samples to be taken.
  
 


This amendment clearly related to substantive
law; it gave police officers the right to demand more than one sample of breath
so as to enable a proper analysis to be made and made it an offence for a
suspect to refuse to give more than one sample of breath; before the amendment,
only one suitable sample of breath could be demanded; thus, a person could,
without committing an offence, refuse to give more than one sample. It is also
clear that this amendment by its very nature may only apply prospectively; the
requirement that the samples of breath be taken “forthwith” or within a
prescribed time frame makes it a physical impossibility to give any
retrospective effect to the new s. 235  Cr.c. (see Hickson v.
Darlow[13];
Upper Canada College v. Smith[14], per
Duff J., at p. 422; R. v. LeSarge[15],
per Houlden J.A., at p. 396).

The new s. 237  applies to samples of breath
taken under the new s. 235 ; this is clear from the opening part of par. (c)
which refers to “samples of the breath of the accused… pursuant to a demand
made under subsection 235(1)”. Under the old s. 235 , there could not
be a demand for “samples” of breath, only for one sample. It follows that the
prospective character of the new s. 235  is determinative of the
construction to be

[Page 239]

placed in that regard upon the new s. 237 ;
it cannot be taken to refer to samples of breath that could not be legally
demanded at the time of the offence. Also, the other amendments to the old
s. 237  make it abundantly clear that the new s. 237  is intended to
apply only when at least two samples of breath have been demanded and obtained
which was not legally permissible under the old s. 235 .

Furthermore, it is apparent that the new
s. 237  cannot in fact operate retrospectively. When only one sample of
breath has been taken because only one was required and could be demanded at
the time, the law cannot make it possible for two samples to have been taken.
The retrospective operation of the new s. 237  which has been adopted by
the Court of Appeal would effectively result in neither the new nor the old
section being operative during the period when the new s. 237  is
supposedly intended to operate retrospectively. This can hardly have been the
result that was intended by Parliament. Ever since the new offence now
described in s. 236  was created in 1969 by the Criminal Law Amendment
Act, (1968-69 (Can.), c. 38, s. 16), a special procedure has been
available so as to ensure the effective investigation and punishment of this
offence. It is indeed apparent that s. 236  cannot, in practice, be
effectively enforced in the absence of provisions similar to those now found in
ss. 235  and 237 . I have no reason to believe that Parliament intended, when passing
the Amendment Act to allow for an interval during which the prosecution
of offences already committed would be frustrated because the rules contained
in ss. 235  and 237  would not be available for the enforcement of s. 236  (R.
v. MacGregor[16], per
Clement J.A., at p. 406).

Another fundamental objection to the validity of
the decision of the Court of Appeal rests on the rule of construction expressed
in s. 36(d) of the Interpretation Act, (R.S.C. 1970,
c. I-23), which reads as follows:

[Page 240]

36. Where an enactment (in this
section called the “former enactment”) is repealed and another enactment
(in this section called the “new enactment”) is substituted therefor,

…

(d) the procedure established
by the new enactment shall be followed as far as it can be adapted thereto in
the recovery or enforcement of penalties and forfeitures incurred, and in the
enforcement of rights, existing or accruing under the former enactment or in a
proceeding in relation to matters that have happened before the repeal;

This statutory rule of construction is a
modification of the common law rule; it imposes restrictions on what would
otherwise be the retrospective operation, in the absence of any contrary
intent, of procedural statutes. It prescribes that the retrospective operation of
procedural enactments shall not be absolute, but will take place only to the
extent that the new rules of procedure may be adapted to the proceedings taken
in respect of the matter that has occurred before the new rules came into
effect; this clearly means that the new procedure shall not apply
retrospectively if or to the extent that it cannot be adapted. Here the new
s. 237  requires two samples of breath while the old s. 237  allowed
for only one. Clearly, the new procedure cannot be adapted; therefore, it does
not apply to a sample of breath taken pursuant to the old s. 235 . This
result would obtain under s. 36 even though, contrary to what I have said
above, s. 237  were, under the rules of the common law, to be regarded as
being retrospective in operation. Section 36 thus constitutes, in my opinion,
an insurmountable obstacle to the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal.

We are in the situation where a procedural
statute has been repealed and no new rule of procedure substituted for the old
one “in relation to matters that have happened before the repeal”. This is
precisely a case for the application of s. 35 of the Interpretation Act
which, generally, abrogates the common law rule “that, when an act of
parliament is repealed, it must be considered (except as to transactions past
and closed) as if it

[Page 241]

had never existed” Surtees v. Ellison[17], per Lord Tenterden at
p. 752). This section reads in part as follows:

35. Where an enactment is repealed in whole
or in part, the repeal does not

…

(b) affect the previous
operation of the enactment so repealed or anything duly done or suffered
thereunder;

(c) affect any right,
privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred
under the enactment so repealed;

(d) affect any offence committed
against or a violation of the provisions of the enactment so repealed, or any
penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred under the enactment so repealed; or

(e) affect any investigation,
legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation,
liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment;

and an investigation, legal proceeding or
remedy as described in paragraph (e) may be instituted, continued
or enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if the
enactment had not been so repealed.

Subparagraphs (b) and (e),
together with the concluding part of this section, are particularly relevant
here. The saving clause contained in the last paragraph permits legal
proceedings to be instituted and continued as if there had been no repeal; I
have no doubt that it covers the procedure to be followed in respect to such
proceeding. Otherwise, the clause would hardly have any practical meaning.
Also, subpara. (b) serves to continue the effect of the
certificate of analysis that was sought to be introduced into evidence by the
Crown under the old s. 237 . This certificate of analysis was in respect of
one sample of breath given pursuant to the old s. 235 ; it was given when
the old s. 237  was still in force and it is conceded that it would be
admissible evidence if this section had not been amended. It is also
undisputable that the only object of this certificate, when it was given prior
to the amended sections coming into force, was to serve as prima facie evidence
of the facts stated therein in connection with a charge

[Page 242]

that might be laid under ss. 234  or 236 . Such a
certificate would certainly be “affected” if because of the repeal of the
section under which it was validly given it were deprived of all evidentiary
value and would thus cease to have any usefulness at all. Section 35(b)
is precisely intended to prevent such an undesirable result.

In support of the decision of the Court of
Appeal, respondent has argued that Parliament’s intention to give a retrospective
effect to the new s. 237  was evidenced by the fact that the Amendment
Act did not come into effect upon its passing, but only as from the day or
days it was proclaimed in force. Reference was made to the English decision of R.
v. The Leeds and Bradford Railway Company[18],
where Lord Campbell C.J., said at p. 346:

If it had been enacted that the provisions
of the statute should come into operation immediately, I should have said that
there was a hardship in their being construed retrospectively, and I should not
have been willing so to construe them. But, here, the Act receiving the Royal
assent on 14th August, sect. 38 directs that it “shall commence and take
effect from the 2d day of October in the year of our Lord 1848.” That
seems to be an intimation by the Legislature that they mean to give a time,
whether long or short, within which bygone matters of complaint may be brought
before justices, and the limitation avoided.

It should be observed that this decision was
criticized by Rolfe B. in Moon v. Durden (supra), at pp.
33 and following. In Re Athlumney[19],
Wright J. said at p. 553:

…One exception to the general rule has
sometimes been suggested, namely, that where, as here, the commencement of the
operation of an Act is suspended for a time, this is an indication that no
further restriction upon retrospective operation is intended. But this
exception seems never to have been suggested except in relation to statutes
affecting procedure, such as Statutes of Limitation, and even in relation to
them it is questioned in Moon v. Durden, (supra). Moreover,
ss. 6 and 8 of this Act have been held not to be retrospective,
notwithstanding, though without reference to this suspensory clause: see Re
Raison, ((1891) 63 L.T. 709) and Reg. v. Griffiths ([1891] 2 Q.B.
145).

[Page 243]

I know of no modern case that deals
authoritatively with this issue and the existence of the rule, let alone its
ambit, has been questioned by modern text book writers. According to Craies (On
Statute Law, 7th ed., p. 395) the result of the court decisions is
that the rule “cannot be accepted as an undoubted rule of construction”. In
Odger’s Construction of Deeds and Statutes, 5th ed., p. 291, it is
stated that “the rule is at least doubtful”, and in Maxwell On
Interpretation of Statutes, 12th ed., p. 227, one reads “that the
exception, if it does exist, is not of any wide application”.

It would therefore appear to be unwise to treat
the test suggested by Lord Campbell as a well established canon of
construction. Furthermore, I fail to see how this rule, if it existed, could be
so rigid as to apply to a situation that affords so many clear indications of a
contrary intent on the part of Parliament.

Respondent also relied heavily on the decision
of this Court in Howard Smith Paper Mills Ltd. v. The Queen[20], where it was held that s. 41
of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, as enacted
by 1949 (2nd Session), c. 12, s. 3, was procedural in character. Such
determination having been made, the question did not arise, evidently because
of the nature of the enactment, as to whether s. 41, although procedural
in character, should nevertheless be construed prospectively because of the
manifested intent of Parliament. The decision of our Court in Howard Smith does
not bear at all on the question I have discussed so far and given the
assumption that I have made as to the procedural character of s. 237 , I
fail to see how it can afford any assistance to the respondent.

Being of the view that the appeal should succeed
even if the new s. 237  were to be regarded as procedural in character, I
do not find it necessary to express any opinion as to the validity of the first
ground of attack advanced by appellant against the decision of the Court of
Appeal.

[Page 244]

I am therefore of the opinion that the question
of law expressed in the stated case should be answered in the negative; it
follows that the appeal should be allowed, the decision of the Court of Appeal
set aside and the conviction pronounced against the respondent on May 5, 1977
by His Honour Magistrate Donald Luther restored. In accordance with the terms
of the order granting leave, the costs of the respondent in this Court are to
be borne by the appellant.

Appeal allowed, conviction restored,

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Murder—Evidence as to
confessions by the accused—Witness of dishonourable repute—Witness originally
supporting accused’s alibi—Charge to the jury—Whether amounting to
misdirection—Whether inconsistent with jury’s obligation to consider all the
evidence—Criminal Code , s. 613(1)  (b).

The appellant and Robert Urbanick were
charged with murder. At trial Urbanick was acquitted and the appellant
convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. The deceased was discovered shot
twice in the head and lying in the back of his pick-up truck. At trial the
principal witness was Nadine Deveau who claimed to have heard the appellant
plotting the murder with the wife of the deceased. She testified inter alia that
the appellant had told her that the victim “died like a dog” and had also said
“I shot him”. Deveau had originally supported an alibi for appellant but some
eight or nine months later revealed to the police what she testified to in
Court. Considerable defence evidence was led to discredit her, a young woman of
unsavory repute, with a criminal record, a history of alcoholism and drug
addiction and the reputation of being a liar. The issue on final appeal was
limited to consideration of the question on which leave to appeal was granted:
whether the Court of Appeal had erred in dismissing the appeal notwithstanding
the following direction in the charge of the trial judge in relation to the
evidence of Nadine Deveau “…if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
what she says is true, then you must act upon that; it is your duty to act, and
in my view you have no alternative but to find, if you believe her beyond a
reasonable doubt, that French was guilty of killing Landers.” The issue was not
raised in the Courts below.

It was argued with force that the real
question was not whether the jury believed Deveau but whether they believed
that the confessions which she attributed to the

[Page 159]

appellant were true. The case of Rustad v.
The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 555, was relied upon.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Rustad is
distinguishable from the present case. There was here no discrepancy between
the method of killing described in the confession and the cause of death and
while there was some evidence of intoxication at the time shortly after the
killing, when the appellant allegedly said to Deveau that he had shot the
deceased, the jury was not sufficiently impressed by it to reduce the verdict
to one of manslaughter. Further there was no evidence of intoxication at the
time of the appellant’s last inculpatory statement some days later. Nor was
there evidence to suggest as was the case in Rustad that the appellant
was lying when he made the statements. If Deveau was not lying the conversation
relating to the murder plot tended to corroborate the confessions. Having
regard to all the circumstances, including the whole tenor of the defence,
which was one of alibi, the direction in issue did not amount to a
misdirection.

Rustad v. The
Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 555 distinguished.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] dismissing an
appeal by the accused from his conviction on a charge of murder.

Clayton C. Ruby and Dianne L. Martin, for
the appellant.

David Watt, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

BEETZ J.—This is an appeal brought with leave of
this Court from a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal which affirmed the
conviction of the appellant entered at trial before Mr. Justice Griffiths
sitting with a jury.

The appellant and Robert Urbanick had been
charged with committing the murder of one Kenneth Landers on August 9, 1975. At
their joint trial, Urbanick was acquitted and the appellant was convicted and
sentenced to life imprisonment.

[Page 160]

The Court of Appeal gave a detailed account of
the facts in its judgment now conveniently reported in (1978), 37 C.C.C. (2d)
201. For the purpose of this appeal, it will suffice to summarize the facts as
follows.

The deceased was discovered by the police on August 10, 1975, lying in the back of his pick‑up
truck. He had been shot twice in the head.

At trial, the principal Crown witness was a
woman by the name of Nadine Deveau. She claimed to have overheard the appellant
plotting the murder with the wife of the deceased on the very day of the
murder: the deceased was an informer and also, according to Nadine Deveau, his
wife was prepared to share with the killer the product of an insurance policy
on her husband’s life. It was the evidence of Nadine Deveau that, on the
evening of August 9, 1975, the appellant told her that Landers “died like a
dog”. She stated that the appellant had also said: “I shot him”. She further
testified that at a later date when she had told the appellant that
Mrs. Landers was not serious about what had happened and had no idea she
would have to pay money, the appellant had replied: “She bloody better remember
it”.

Nadine Deveau had originally supported an alibi
for the appellant but some eight or nine months later she revealed to the
police what she testified to in Court. She stated she did not tell the truth
earlier to the police because she feared for her life and the life of her
child.

Considerable evidence was led by the defence to
discredit Nadine Deveau, a young woman of unsavory repute with a criminal
record, a history of alcoholism and drug addiction, and the reputation of being
a liar.

Leave to appeal was granted upon the following
question of law:

Did the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario
err in dismissing the appeal of the Applicant notwithstanding the following
direction contained in the charge of the learned trial judge in relation to the
evidence of Nadine Deveau:

[Page 161]

....if you are satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that what she says is true, then you must act upon that; it is
your duty to act, and in my view you have no alternative but to find, if you
believe her beyond a reasonable doubt, that French was guilty of killing
Landers.

We are limited to a consideration of this
question. It was not raised in the Court of Appeal; nor had the specific
direction contained in the learned trial judge’s charge and now in issue been
objected to at trial.

The following excerpts from the charge to the
jury indicate the context in which the language which is now in question was
employed by the learned trial judge:

Now, in this case, the Crown’s case against
both accused rests very substantially on the evidence of Nadine Deveau, as to
conversations she alleges she had with each of the accused. Other than that,
there is no direct evidence, as I recall it, against Urbanick; and as against
Thomas French, the evidence is, in addition to Nadine Deveau’s testimony,
almost wholly circumstantial…

…

Now, the theory of the defence of Thomas
French is as follows:

The Crown’s case rests on the foundation
provided by Nadine Deveau’s evidence. She is a self-confessed persistent liar,
thief and drug addict, who originally gave the police an alibi for Tom French,
and only many months later, in suspicious circumstances, accused Tom French.
Because of her character and her propensity to lie, and because of her
involvement in crime, it would be dangerous to convict on her evidence. No one
who knows her would believe her under oath, and in any event, look to the
evidence as regards the story of the original plot to murder Ken Landers; she
is supported by no one and contradicted by Mrs. Landers…

...

Members of the Jury, the whole case really
depends on what you think of Nadine Deveau’s evidence insofar as it
incriminates one or the other of the accused. Obviously she is a key witness.
If you do not believe her, or you are in doubt, then that is the end of it. The
Crown asked you to believe her; he said she testified for five hours and she
stood up well. She honestly admitted things during her cross-examination that
were incriminating, for example, that she was wearing a stolen dress that could
not otherwise have been proven.

[Page 162]

He suggests it took courage for her to
testify; you must consider the threats to her. The Crown scoffs at the
suggestion she was giving evidence just to avoid what would be a fairly minor
conviction for her, conviction for driving while impaired on two occasions, he
said it is incredible for you to believe to avoid conviction on those two minor
charges, she is prepared to face the risk and to expose herself, as she has.

…

Now, Defence counsel attacks her
credibility. They say she is an admitted thief, she lied about when she had
last used drugs, even though she admitted she had been on drugs, but she
deliberately lied as to when she had last been on them; she lied about whether
she is using drugs currently. It is obvious she had recently been on marijuana,
according to the evidence. She lied to the doctor when she was admitted to
hospital, and they submit that her lies and the inconsistencies in her story
make her evidence very suspect.

…

The fact is, members of the jury, she is,
as I have said, the most crucial witness in this case; and even if she were an
independent person, I would direct you in strong terms that you must scrutinize
her evidence most carefully, but because she is a person with a criminal record
and of ill repute, admittedly ill repute, then you should be even more careful
in weighing her evidence which is uncorroborated or unsupported so far as the
statements to her are concerned. Members of the Jury, even people with criminal
records and people who are on drugs and people who have a bad reputation, are
capable of telling the truth. If you assess this girl, on the basis of what you
saw of her, as a truthful witness, if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that what she says is true, then, you must act upon that; it is your duty
to act, and in my view you have no alternative but to find, if you believe her
beyond a reasonable doubt, that French was guilty of killing Landers.

…

The whole case against Thomas French rests
on the evidence of Nadine Deveau, plus some circumstantial evidence, his
admission that he was at the Landers’ place at about nine o’clock, at about a
time when men came in and Landers was taken away. That is it.

It was argued with force that the real question
was not whether the jury believed the evidence of

[Page 163]

Nadine Deveau but whether they believed that the
confessions which she attributed to the appellant were true. The case of Rustad
v. The Queen[2] was
relied upon.

In Rustad, the appellant had been charged
with the non-capital murder of her mother-in-law and convicted of manslaughter.
The only direct evidence connecting the appellant with the death was an alleged
confession made to a friend and three alleged statements made to another
friend. The appellant was intoxicated when she made the confession and the
statements, and there was an inconsistency between the method of killing
described in the confession and the cause of death as revealed by medical
evidence. It was held by Ritchie J., speaking for the majority, at p. 563,
that:

the charge to the jury should…have
contained specific direction to the effect that the truth of the appellant’s
alleged admission was to be considered in light of this discrepancy and in
light also of the appellant’s intoxication at the time when the admission was
alleged to have been made.

In the case at bar, there is no discrepancy
between the method of killing described in the alleged confession and the cause
of death; the appellant is reported to have said: “I shot him” and in fact the
victim was shot. While there is evidence of intoxication at the time when the
appellant allegedly said to Nadine Deveau that he had shot Kenneth Landers,
(which would have been shortly after the actual killing), the jury was not
sufficiently impressed by it to reduce the verdict to one of manslaughter.
Furthermore, there is no evidence that the appellant was intoxicated when he is
reported to have made his last inculpatory statement to Nadine Deveau some days
after the date of the murder. Moreover, there is no evidence tending to
suggest, as was the case in Rustad, that the appellant was lying when he
made the incriminating statements. Finally, if Nadine Deveau was not lying,
then the conversation relating to the murder plot tended to corroborate the
confessions.

For these reasons, I am of the opinion that Rustad
is clearly distinguishable and that the

[Page 164]

learned trial judge was under no duty to warn
the jury that the accused might have been lying when he confessed to Nadine
Deveau.

On the other hand, it is argued that the learned
trial judge has gone too far in telling the jury that if they believed the
witness Deveau, they had no alternative but to find the appellant guilty of
killing Landers: such direction might have prevented the consideration of the
possibility that the appellant was lying when he made the incriminating
statements to Nadine Deveau. But this possibility was purely theoretical in the
context of the case. The appellant testified. His defence was an alibi. As for
the incriminating statements, he simply and flatly denied having made them but
neither he in his testimony nor his counsel before the jury ever suggested
that, if he had made them, they were untrue. The whole tenor of the defence was
that Nadine Deveau was the liar, not the accused. The record discloses no
evidence tending to show that the appellant lied if he made the incriminating
statements and there is accordingly no basis from which the argument might
derive substance or reality.

Given those circumstances, I cannot be persuaded
that the direction in issue amounted to a misdirection. But even if the learned
trial judge did err, I am nevertheless satisfied when the charge is read as a
whole that this is a case in which no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice resulted from the error and the provisions of s. 613 (1) (b) of
the Criminal Code  should be applied.

It was also submitted that the direction in
issue was inconsistent with the jury’s obligation to consider all the evidence.
But the learned trial judge repeatedly instructed the jury to consider all of
the evidence and his instructions as a whole.

officer—New trial ordered—Non-applicability of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code .

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1],

first degree murder. Appeal allowed.

H.E. Wolch and H. Leonoff, for the
appellant.

J.G. Dangerfield, Q.C., and S.J. Whitley,
for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally
by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—We are all of the opinion
that, in the circumstances of this case, there should be a new trial for
failure to hold a voir dire on a statement allegedly made by the accused
to a police officer which, admittedly, related to a crucial point in the trial
and could well have made the difference between first and second degree murder.
We reaffirm the judgment of this Court in Erven v. The Queen[2]. This is not a case for applying
s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .

It becomes unnecessary, therefore, to deal with
the second point raised by the appellant respecting the introduction of new
evidence.

In the result, the appeal is allowed, the
judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal is set aside,

[Page 367]

and the conviction is quashed and a new trial is
directed.

Judgment accordingly.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Murder—Indecent assault—Mental
elements—Specific intent—Defence of drunkenness—Underlying offence—Possession
or use of weapon during the commission or attempted commission of indecent
assault—Charge to the jury—Whether deficiency in the trial judge’s charge
caused a prejudice to the accused or a miscarriage of justice—Criminal Code ,
ss. 212 (a), 213 .

The appellant was convicted of first degree
murder before a judge and jury, under s. 213  (d) of the Criminal
Code , where the underlying offence, during the commission of which death
was caused, was indecent assault on a female. He accompanied her to her
apartment and he remembered that when she opened a drawer in the kitchen where
there were knives there was a bright glare or flash of light. That was the last
thing he remembered until he was walking in the street. The police had found
the partially undressed body of Mary McKenna in her bedroom with one hundred
and thirty-two knife wounds.

He raised drunkenness as a defence and from
expert evidence adduced as to the blood alcohol levels that could have been
attained by the appellant, considering the amount he recalled drinking, the
jury would have been able to infer that the appellant was highly intoxicated
during the evening.

His appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed. The main points of
significance raised on appeal by leave of this Court are embraced in the
following questions: 1. What are the mental elements which must be shown for a
conviction of murder under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code ? 2.
Can evidence of drunkenness be taken into consideration in determining whether
the mental elements required for a conviction of murder under s. 213 (d)
of the Criminal Code  have been shown? 3. Was there error in the
trial judge’s charge on the applicability of the defence of drunkenness, as it
could apply to a charge of murder under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code ?

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 957]

Subsection (d) of subs. 213 of
the Criminal Code  differs significantly from subss. (a), (b)
and (c) of that section. No mental element is required under
subs. (d) beyond the minimal intent to use or to have a weapon.
To ascertain the mental elements required for the establishment of criminal
liability under s. 213(d) of the Code, it is necessary to
consider the mental elements of the underlying offence, the commission of which
calls the section into play, in this case indecent assault. The mental
elements for murder under s. 213 (d) cannot be less than those required
for the commission of the underlying offence which invokes the section.

Section 213(d) requires
the commission or attempted commission of the underlying offence, but does not
itself provide for any further intent. In such case, the mental element
required for a conviction of murder must be found in the intent to commit the
underlying offence, here an indecent assault. The problem in this case arises
because the underlying offence is one which requires only a basic or general
intent and in respect of which when standing alone the defence of a drunkenness
would not apply. The trial judge ought to have instructed the jury that if
having considered the evidence including that of intoxication, they doubted the
appellant’s mental capacity to form the intent required for the completion of
the indecent assault because of his state of intoxication, murder would have
not been proved. If they were satisfied that the appellant had done the
killing, it would be manslaughter. The statement of the Lord Chancellor in Beard’s
case, [1920] A.C. 479, supports the proposition that the underlying offence
in constructive murder must have been consciously committed. If s. 213(d)
did not require proof of such conscious commission, it would be providing
for a conviction of murder in the absence of any mental element or intent.

As to the option of manslaughter, it was
clearly left to the jury in respect of murder under s. 212 of the Code. While
it could have been made in more explicit terms in respect of s. 213(d),
no reversible error occurred in this connection.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court
of Appeal[1],
dismissing an appeal by appellant from his conviction on a charge of murder
following a trial by judge and jury. Appeal dismissed.

Morris Manning, Q.C., for the appellant.

Douglas J. Ewart, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—This appeal raises questions
regarding the applicability of the defence of drunkenness to a charge of first
degree murder, under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code , where
the underlying offence, during the commission of which the death was caused,
was indecent assault on a female. The appellant was convicted of first degree
murder before a judge and jury, and his appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed. This appeal is taken
by leave of this Court.

On the evening of September 20, 1976, the police
entered the apartment of the deceased Mary McKenna and found her body in the
bedroom, lying face down upon the floor. The body was clothed only in panties,
pantyhose and brassiere. The straps of the brassiere were pulled down, but it
was still hooked in the back. Medical evidence determined that she had died as
a result of shock and hemorrhage due to one hundred and thirty-two stab wounds,
eighteen of which occurred after death. A blood‑stained dress was found
by the body. It had thirty cuts or holes from which it could have been inferred
by the jury that some, but not all, stab wounds were received while she wore
the dress and that the dress was removed during the progress of the assault.
Three kitchen knives and one knife-blade, some bent and bearing blood stains of
Group ‘B’, the group of the deceased, were found in the apartment. The time of
death could not be determined medically but a

[Page 959]

woman who occupied the apartment below the
deceased gave evidence that at about 2:45 a.m. on September 19 she heard a female crying out: “No, stop it,
don’t…,” and also a male voice. She could not distinguish any words spoken by
the male voice. A thumb print matching that of the appellant was found on a
saucer in the apartment.

The appellant, aged twenty-nine, was an
alcoholic. He had spent the afternoon of September 18 drinking with some
friends. In the evening he went with them to the Maple Leaf Ballroom in Toronto, and there continued drinking in
the bar. Later, after dancing a while, he introduced a woman to some of his
friends as Mary. The friends then went their separate ways.

One Karas, a member of the group who went to the
dancehall with the appellant, said that the appellant telephoned him at his
home about 2:45 a.m. the next morning saying that he was outside a tavern
called The Jolly Miller on Yonge Street near York Mills Avenue. He asked if he could sleep at Karas’ home. Karas met the appellant
with his car and picked him up. He noted that the appellant was then wearing a
jacket but no shirt. He said he had ripped his shirt “walking and climbing a
fence” and had discarded it. Karas estimated that The Jolly Miller was two and
one-half to three miles from 120 Broadway, the deceased’s address. At Karas’
home the appellant said he had ‘picked up’ a girl at the Maple Leaf Ballroom.
It may be noted here that there was evidence given by a friend of the deceased that
she had gone to the dance at the ballroom that evening with the deceased.

On October 8, 1976, the appellant, who had
then gone to Edmonton, went to
a hospital and told a nurse to have him arrested for killing a woman in Toronto. The Edmonton police after inquiries in Toronto released the appellant, whom they had temporarily detained, because
the Toronto police had no
record of a killing at the address given by the appellant which was not that of
the deceased.

[Page 960]

The appellant returned to Toronto and, on November 3, 1976, while
drinking with a friend, said he had killed the girl at the Maple Leaf Ballroom.
Later he telephoned the Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital in Toronto at about 9:00 p.m. and told the
switchboard operator: “I am a killer, I killed someone and I want to talk to
someone.” He made two further calls repeating his statements. A police
constable named Fisher who was on duty at the hospital heard the third
conversation. On that occasion arrangements were made to have the appellant see
one of the doctors. At 11:30 p.m. the appellant was driven to the hospital where he spoke with
Constable Fisher and a Doctor Slezak. He said: “I think I have murdered a Mary
McKinnon.” In reply to questions, he said he had met her at the Maple Leaf
Ballroom and, “I want a top psychiatrist with me when I say this.” The police
officer said that Dr. Slezak was a psychiatrist and the appellant then
continued:

She invited me to her apartment. She went
to the kitchen. She opened the drawer, she had knives, kitchen knives. I was
standing by the wall. When she opened the drawer there was a flash. I picked up
a knife and followed her, I was a robot. I stuck it in her. She fell into the
bedroom.

He continued, saying: “I want to speak to a
psychiatrist about the fact when she opened the drawer, about the flash.” He
remembered walking down Yonge Street, apparently on his way home, and said that he had no blood on his
hands. He described how he had heard news broadcasts the next day and later he
read about the killing. Two other officers arrived at about that time and the
appellant made further statements. He said:

I want to talk about the drawer in the
kitchen. I was drunk. My feet was giving out from me. This girl said Roman
you’re drunk. You should leave. The drawer thing drives me nuts. I don’t know
why she opened the drawer.

It was a flash that hit me, saw the knives,
she was getting ready for bed. I went to the bar, had a couple of vodka, she
opened the drawer in the kitchen. I read in the newspaper she was stabbed twenty-six
times and

[Page 961]

throat was cut. I think this is what
happened, put this in your book. I want to find out why I did it, that was the
major thing when she opened the drawer, I turned robot, waves from outer space,
I took a knife, put it to my side. I remember so vivid, I walked home, York
Mills near Jolly Miller. She looked at me, I lifted up my hand, I struck her. I
walked out of the kitchen with object in my hand. She was standing in the
doorway, maybe bedroom. I followed her, struck her, yelled my name ‘Roman’. I
was a robot, I made sure I had no blood on me.

On Saturday, November 6, 1976, the police had a
further conversation with the appellant in which he referred to earlier
incriminating statements as fantasy. He was then cautioned and he gave a
lengthy statement which is summarized, as follows:

The Appellant went with his friends from
Karas’ house to the Maple Leaf Ballroom, arriving at around 10:00 p.m. He danced with a number of girls, and
left alone, around 12:00 midnight. He recalled walking and being around YongeSt. and York Mills; he
thought he recalled seeing the Jolly Miller. He remembered reading the sign.

He recalled walking on YongeSt. and missing
a bus; the only thing he remembered after that was walking down Bathurst Street and opening the front door
of his house.

On Monday night he heard on the radio that
a woman had been murdered. On Tuesday he read an account of the killing in the
newspaper. The newspaper account stated where the victim lived, gave her name
and age, and also showed a picture of her.

The C.B.C. News on television had a film
clip which showed part of the bedroom and living‑room in the deceased’s
apartment.

Another article in the newspaper said that
she had not been sexually molested and that she was in her night clothes. The
newspaper account said the victim had been stabbed twenty-six times, and her
throat was cut.

A friend of his had committed himself to
the Lakeshore Hospital and this
is what he thought “triggered” his going to the hospital. He started his “murder
routine” that day with Seymour Grosser. He remembered telling Seymour about “doing the girl in” from the
Maple Leaf.

[Page 962]

He phoned four times to the hospital and
said he was a murderer, and the girl wanted to put him through to a doctor.

He was merely playing a role when he told
the officers at the hospital about killing a girl.

Upon being reminded by Staff-Sergeant
Newsome that he had told the officers how he had stabbed the girl, and where,
the Appellant said: “I recall the Jolly Miller, the waves from outer space. I
don’t know. I should have been given a typewriter. I could have written a
200-page film script.”

After he had signed this statement the appellant
gave the police his fingerprints. He was arrested and cautioned on a charge of
first degree murder. He was then told that his fingerprints matched the print
which had been found on a saucer in the deceased’s apartment. To this he
replied: “That’s incredible. That’s incredible. I am convinced now that I did
do it.” He then said, “What is first degree murder?” The police officer
answered: “First degree murder is when a female person is killed while being
sexually attacked or an attempt is made to sexually attack her.” The appellant
replied: “I didn’t sexually violate her.” It may be noted here that medical
evidence indicated that no sexual intercourse with the deceased had occurred.
The police officer then asked the appellant if he wished to tell him anything
about the matter, to which the appellant replied: “Give me a couple of minutes,
that fingerprint has got my head going.” Shortly afterwards, he gave a second
statement, which can be summarized in this fashion:

He could not understand why it was first
degree murder, because she was not sexually molested. He met a girl at the
Maple Leaf Ballroom. They had talked for about an hour. She said she was
looking for a meaningful relationship, and he told her that he was looking for
the same thing. He suggested going to her place. She wanted to go to his place,
but he talked her into going to her place. Before leaving he had two more
“shots” of vodka. They flagged a cab; he didn’t know where they were going; she
gave the directions.

[Page 963]

They talked, he couldn’t say for how long;
she made coffee. She was preparing to go to bed, and hinting that he should
leave. He was sitting on a couch in the livingroom. The next thing he
remembered, they were both in the kitchen, perhaps she was washing something.
She opened a kitchen drawer to get something. He saw some knives, and she left
the kitchen. He took one of the knives and followed her out of the kitchen
towards the door of the closet at the end of the hall, where the bathroom is.
He struck out at her with the knife. His hand “sort of went into a pump
action”; he stabbed her in the side, the stomach and the chest. They sort of
fell into the bedroom. He continued to stab her until she lay motionless.

Something happened in the kitchen when she
opened the drawer with the knives. The opening of the drawer “triggered off”
something. There was “sort of a flash of light” and a glare; something weird
which he just did not understand. It was as if he “was transferred from a human
being into a robot”. When his hand reached for the knife, he felt no motion,
and it was “as if (he) had no senses”. It was as if he “was obeying some sort
of command”.

He held the knife in his hand “and like a
robot” his “hand just reached out and plunged into her”. His hand “just became
like a pump”. She called out his name when they fell into the bedroom. The
first knife that he used broke in the bedroom. He got up, went to the kitchen,
got another knife, returned to the bedroom and repeated the process. He did not
know what happened to that knife, but he went to the kitchen and got a third
knife. He continued to stab her with the third knife; she was motionless by
this time. He got up; he felt “weird”. He had nothing against her; she was a
good person. He could not understand why this happened. He took the knives with
him and “got rid of them” in a sewer and some garbage cans in the area.

He didn’t know where he was and wandered
around. He thought there was some blood on his hands. He was walking in
circles, and made his way to YongeSt. and York Mills. He walked home from there.

He awoke the next morning about 11:30 with a feeling that he had stabbed someone
the night before. He said to himself that it wasn’t possible; maybe it is one
of these guilt feelings. He was hoping that the images he had in his mind were
just a nightmare. He read the newspapers, and listened to the news, and felt relieved

[Page 964]

when there was nothing mentioned. On
Monday, he heard on the radio that they had found a body; when it was announced
that it was the body of a man, he felt relieved because in his “flashbacks” it
was a woman. He froze when there was a further announcement that they had found
the body of a woman on Mount Pleasant and Eglinton. In a way, “the guilt came back”, but he felt relieved
because he was positive that the woman lived on Sheppard, between Bathurst and Yonge. On Tuesday, there was a
picture of the woman in the paper; the article said her age was 37, but the
woman told him her age was 31.

The name Mary stuck in his mind and that
bothered him. On Tuesday night there was a news broadcast which showed the
apartment where the body was found. It was a basement apartment, and he had
recalled entering an elevator in the apartment building, and either going down
or up. It was announced that she had been at the Maple Leaf Ballroom, and his
“guilt feeling overtook” him that it was probably him.

A composite picture of the suspect was
published on Thursday. The picture didn’t look at all like him and, after
seeing the picture he felt that he didn’t do it; that it was a product of his
imagination, and he began to convince himself that he didn’t do it. He had to
do this because of the intolerable struggle between his feeling of guilt and
his feeling that he wasn’t guilty. The “guilt” finally overtook him, and he
went to the hospital to surrender, but after questioning by detectives, they
let him go. He began to think that maybe he didn’t do it. The one thing that
would convince him was his fingerprints, and that’s why he voluntarily gave
them. That was the last piece of evidence that he needed.

When asked for an explanation as to why
more than one knife was used, he replied: “I think one knife broke and the
other one bent”. He agreed to go to the apartment with the detectives and show
them where the “incident” occurred, and then said, “although everything adds
up, I don’t feel 100% guilty”.

The appellant gave evidence at trial. He said he
was intoxicated when he went to the Maple Leaf Ballroom, and he drank more
after his arrival. He met a woman and he agreed to leave the ballroom and go to
her apartment. All he could remember was standing in a room which must have
been the kitchen. He was about to leave. His knees buckled, a drawer opened,
there was a bright glare or flash

[Page 965]

of light. That was the last thing he remembered
until he was walking on York Mills Road and saw The Jolly Miller’ sign. He remembered phoning Karas. He
said, on awakening the next morning, he had no feeling that he was responsible
for the death but he felt he must have done something wrong. He explained the
events in Edmonton as
“drunkenness”. He told the police on November 6 that the deceased was not
sexually molested because he had read that in the newspaper. He said the
statement of November 6 was what he recalled up to the point when he mentioned
that he and the girl spoke together. Thereafter, he said that he was creating a
script. He was speculating on what might have happened. His statement resulted
from facts which he recalled, speculation based on news reports he had read and
heard, information which he said was manipulated into his mind by the police,
and his own habit of dramatization.

Expert evidence was adduced as to the blood
alcohol levels that could have been attained by the appellant on the assumption
that he had consumed the large amounts of alcohol he claimed, and on the effect
such consumption would have on his physical activity, mental capacity and
judgment. The evidence was such that the jury would be able to infer that the
appellant was highly intoxicated during that evening. This evidence was
reviewed fairly by the trial judge in his charge to the jury and needs no
further recitation here.

The matters in issue in this appeal were
expressed differently by opposing counsel in their factums. The main points of
significance raised and argued before this Court are embraced in the following
questions:

1. What are the mental elements which must be
shown for a conviction of murder under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code ?

2. Can evidence of drunkenness be taken into
consideration in determining whether the mental elements required for a
conviction of murder under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  have
been shown?

[Page 966]

3. Was there error in the trial judge’s charge
on the applicability of the defence of drunkenness, as it could apply to a
charge of murder under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code ?

Before dealing with the mental elements required
for conviction under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code , the
positions of the parties to this appeal must be understood. At trial the Crown
took the position that the appellant had committed a murder under s. 212(a)
of the Code, in that he stabbed the deceased with intent to kill or with
intent to cause bodily harm which he knew would be likely to cause death and
was reckless whether it ensued or not. Alternatively, if the jury had doubts on
the appellant’s ability to form the required intents under s. 212(a) of
the Code, it was argued that he would be guilty of murder under s. 213 (d),
having used a weapon during the commission of an indecent assault and thereby
caused a death, irrespective of his intent. The Crown also took the position
that a conviction under either section would amount to first degree
murder, by virtue of s. 214(5)(b) of the Code, because death was
caused by the use of a weapon while committing an indecent assault.

No objection was taken before this Court to the
trial judge’s charge in respect of 212(a) of the Criminal Code . The
principal submissions of the appellant turned on the application of the defence
of drunkenness to a charge of murder based on s. 213 (d). An examination
of the mental elements required for a conviction under that section must
be made. Section 213 of the Code is reproduced in its entirety.

213.
Culpable homicide is murder where a person causes the death of a human being
while committing or attempting to commit high treason or treason or an offence
mentioned in section 52 (sabotage), 76 (piratical acts), 76.1 (hijacking
an aircraft), 132 or subsection 133(1) or sections 134 to 136 (escape
or rescue from prison or lawful custody), 143 or 145 (rape or attempt to commit
rape), 149 or 156 (indecent assault), subsection 246(2) (resisting lawful
arrest), 247 (kidnapping and forcible confinement), 302 (robbery), 306
(breaking and entering) or 389 or 390 (arson), whether or not the

[Page 967]

person means to cause death to any human
being and whether or not he knows that death is likely to be caused to any
human being, if

(a) he means to cause bodily
harm for the purpose of

(i) facilitating the commission of the
offence, or 

(ii) facilitating his flight after
committing or attempting to commit the offence,

and the death ensues from the bodily harm;

(b) he administers a
stupefying or overpowering thing for a purpose mentioned in paragraph (a),
and the death ensues therefrom;

(c) he wilfully stops, by any means,
the breath of a human being for a purpose mentioned in paragraph (a),
and the death ensues therefrom; or

(d) he uses a weapon or has
it upon his person

(i) during or at the time he commits or
attempts to commit the offence, or

(ii) during or at the time of his flight
after committing or attempting to commit the offence,

and the death ensues as a consequence.

It is apparent at once that s. 213 (d)
of the Criminal Code  differs significantly from subss. (a),
(b), and (c) of that section. Each of subss. (a),
(b), and (c) requires proof of a mental element
to procure a conviction of murder: in subs. (a), an intent to cause
bodily harm for the purpose of facilitating the commission of the underlying
offence, or facilitating flight after the commission or attempted commission of
the offence; in subs. (b), the administration of a stupefying or
overpowering thing for a purpose mentioned in subs. (a); in subs,
(c), the wilful stopping of the breath of a human being for a purpose
mentioned in subs. (a). Subsection (d) differs
from the others in that it requires only possession or use of a weapon during
the commission or attempted commission of the underlying offence, or during or
at the time of the flight after committing or attempting the commission of the
offence. No mental element is required under subs. (d) beyond the
minimal intent to use or to have a weapon. The subsection applies,
irrespective of any intent to cause death or any knowledge of its likelihood,
where an accused, while armed, is shown to have committed or attempted the
commission of one of the offences named in the section. It therefore becomes
necessary in ascer-

[Page 968]

taining the mental elements required for the
establishment of criminal liability, under s. 213(d) of the Code,
to consider the mental elements of the underlying offence, the commission
of which calls the section into play, in this case indecent assault. This
I consider to be so, for reasons which I will develop later, because in my
opinion the mental elements for murder under s. 213 (d) cannot be
less than those required for the commission of the underlying offence which
invokes the section.

The law has been settled that an indecent
assault is an assault that is committed in circumstances of indecency, or as
sometimes described, an assault with acts of indecency. What acts are indecent
and what circumstances will have that character are questions of fact that will
have to be decided in each case, but the determination of those questions will
depend upon an objective view of the facts and circumstances in relation to the
actual assault, and not upon the mental state of the accused. This view has
been expressed in R. v. Resener[2], in
the British Columbia Court of Appeal, a case which reviewed various authorities
on the subject, and which was referred to with approval by Pigeon J. in this
Court in Leary v. The Queen[3], at
p. 57. This was, as well, the view expressed by Martin J.A. for the Ontario
Court of Appeal. In dealing with this case, he said:

The definition of “indecent assault”, which
has long been accepted in England, is an assault accompanied by circumstances
of indecency on the part of the accused towards the person assaulted: see R.
v. Leeson (1968), 52 Cr. App. 185 at p. 187.

In my view, the Canadian and the English
law do not differ in this respect. In R. v. Louie Chong (1914), 23
C.C.C. 250, the Appellant seized hold of the complainant and offered her money
for “an immoral purpose”. It was contended on behalf of the Appellant in that
case, that an indecent assault is not committed unless the act constituting the
assault is itself indecent in its nature; that all that the Appellant did was
to take hold of the complainant, and the words used by him did not import
indecency into the act. This Court, in affirming the conviction, held that an
act which is ambiguous may be interpreted by the surrounding circumstances and
the

[Page 969]

words used by the accused. Middleton, J.,
speaking for the Court, said at p. 251:—

“It is in each case a question of fact
whether the thing which was done, in the circumstances in which it was done,
was done indecently…”

and later:

In any event, the judgment of the Court of
Appeal of British Columbia in R. v. Resener, supra, holding that a
specific intent to assault indecently is not a necessary element of indecent
assault was cited with approval by Pigeon J., delivering the majority judgment
of the Supreme Court of Canada in Leary v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R.
29, at p. 57, and we must now take the law in this respect to be settled.

The only intent required for indecent
assault is the general or basic intent to do the act which, in the
circumstances in which it was done, in fact, constitutes an indecent assault. I
accept the submission of Mr. Ewart for the Crown, that if the Appellant
removed the deceased’s dress against her will, that act was capable of being an
indecent assault, irrespective of the Appellant’s purpose.

It must follow, therefore, that the mental
element or intents which must be shown before a conviction of murder under s.
213 (d) can be obtained, where the underlying offence relied upon by the
Crown is indecent assault, is the basic intent to do the acts which,
objectively viewed, amount to the indecent assault coupled with the basic or
general intent to possess, and in this case to use, a weapon.

The second principal issue concerns the
relevance of evidence of intoxication to the question of whether the Crown had
established the existence of the mental element or intents required for a
conviction of murder under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code . Contending
that such evidence was relevant, counsel for the appellant put his argument on
the basis that indecent assault was an offence of specific intent and
accordingly the jury should have been charged in respect of murder under s.
213 (d), as they had been under s. 212 (a), to the effect that if
the evidence of intoxication left the jury in doubt as to the capacity of the
appellant to

[Page 970]

form the intent to commit an indecent assault,
murder would not be shown and they could then convict of manslaughter, if
otherwise satisfied that the appellant had caused the death. The effect of the
charge given here, it was said, was to eliminate consideration of drunkenness
under s. 213 (d) and deprive the jury of the option to bring in a
verdict of guilt on lesser offence of manslaughter. Counsel for the Crown
argued that the evidence of intoxication could not be relevant to a charge
under s. 213(d) of the Code, because the defence of
drunkenness could have application only in respect of offences of specific
intent.

In view of the recent decision of this Court in Leary,
supra, on this branch of the argument it is not necessary to canvass at any
length the various authorities on the general application of the defence of
drunkenness. Speaking for the majority of the Court (Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.), Pigeon J. said, at p. 57:

In my view, rape is a crime involving only
general intention as distinguished from a specific intention and is therefore a
crime in which the defence of drunkenness can have no application.

He reviewed the authorities including Director
of Public Prosecutions v. Beard[4],
Director of Public Prosecutions v. Majewski[5]
and R. v. George[6] and
settled the law on this point. The effect of this decision, in my opinion, is
to confirm the long-established rule that the defence of drunkenness is
available only in cases involving offences requiring proof of a specific intent
on the part of the accused. Where an accused person is so affected by
intoxication that he is deprived of the mental capacity to form the specific
intent required, an essential element of the offence is absent. Because
indecent assault is an offence of general or basic

[Page 971]

intent, the defence of drunkenness cannot apply
where a person is charged with that offence.

The appellant argued in the alternative that
even accepting the proposition that indecent assault ordinarily requires only
proof of a general or basic intent, when the offence is relied upon by the
Crown to justify a conviction of murder under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code , different considerations arise and evidence of drunkenness is
relevant to the issue of guilt under that section. Martin J.A., in the Court of
Appeal, described the submission in these words:

Mr. Manning’s final submission on this
branch of his argument is much more cogent. It is this: Accepting the law to be
that voluntary or self-induced intoxication cannot negative the general intent,
which constitutes the only mental element required for indecent assault, the
rule is one of policy which has no application to the offence of first degree
murder where, as here, proof that the accused committed an indecent assault on
the victim is essential to constitute the crime of murder.

It must be borne in mind that in this case the
appellant was charged, not with indecent assault, but with first degree murder.
The indecent assault must be proved as an essential element of the crime
charged, but it is only the underlying offence that brings into operation the
provisions of s. 213 (d), which makes the subsequent death murder,
the offence with which this case is concerned.

In very early times, murder was simply the
killing of a human being and no proof of any particular intention was required.
This stark concept, however, soon became softened and to procure a conviction
for murder it became necessary to show, not only a killing, but in addition a
mental element referred to as ‘malice aforethought’. This expression, at least
in modern usage, is misleading, but it has come to be a comprehensive term to
describe the various forms of mens rea or the various mental elements
which must be present to justify a conviction for murder. The term is dealt
with in Kenny’s Outlines of Criminal Law (1902), at p. 132:

[Page 972]

(5) Malice aforethought. The
preceding elements in the definition of murder are common to all forms of
criminal homicide; but this fifth point is the distinctive attribute of those
homicides that are murderous. When, as we have seen, the legislature determined
to take away the “benefit of clergy” from the most heinous cases of homicide,
it adopted the already familiar notion of “malice aforethought” (malitia
praecogitata) as the degree of wickedness which should deprive a homicidal
“clerk” of his ancient right to escape capital punishment. The phrase is still
retained in the modern law of murder; but both the words in it have lost their
original meanings. For the forensic experience of successive generations
brought into view many cases of homicide in which there had been no
premeditated desire for the death of the person slain, yet which seemed heinous
enough to deserve the full penalties of murder. These accordingly, one after
another, were brought within the definition of that offence by a wide judicial
construction of its language. Hence a modern student may fairly regard the
phrase “malice aforethought” as now a mere arbitrary symbol. It still remains a
convenient comprehensive term for including all the very various forms of mens
rea which are so heinous that a homicide produced by any of them will be a
murder.

Similar statements are to be found in the
writings of both early and modern writers on the common law. See, for example,
Stephen’s Commentaries (2d) Vol. 4, at p. 143; Blackstone’s Commentaries
on the Law of England, 4 B1. Comm. 198; and the words of Glanville
Williams, Textbook of Criminal Law (1978), at p. 204:

How is murder defined?

The classic definition of murder is that of
Sir Edward (Chief Justice) Coke, though its antiquated wording requires careful
glossing.

‘Murder is when a man. . .awfully killeth…
any reasonable creature in rerum natura under the king’s peace, with
malice aforethought, either expressed by the party, or implied by law, so as
the party wounded, or hurt, etc. die of the wound, or hurt, etc. within a year
and a day after the same.’

‘Any reasonable creature’ means any human
being (a demented person being protected), and ‘in rerum natural (in
being) excludes the unborn child. ‘Under the king’s peace’ covers everyone
except the enemy killed in operations of war.

How are murder and manslaughter
distinguished?

[Page 973]

The requirements for both are the same
except in respect of the fault element and mitigating circumstances. Murder
requires, positively, the mental element traditionally known as ‘malice
aforethought’, and, negatively, the absence of certain mitigating circumstances
that would turn the case into one of manslaughter.

This principle has been carried forward into the
law of Canada: see R. v.
Graves[7], where
Graham, E.J., of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division, referred to
malice aforethought in these words, at p. 44:

The meaning of “malice aforethought” in its
legal sense may be learned from the report of the eminent commissioners who
prepared the Draft Code of England, from which the Canadian Criminal Code is
copied, viz., Lord Blackburn, and Barry, Lush, and Fitzjames Stephen, JJ.

Page 23:— “The present law may, we think,
be stated with sufficient exactness for our present purpose somewhat as
follows: Murder is culpable homicide by any act done with malice aforethought.
Malice aforethought is a common name for all the following states of mind:—

“(a) An intent preceding the act to
kill or to do serious bodily injury to the person killed, or to any other
person.

“(b) Knowledge that the act done is
likely to produce such consequences, whether coupled with an intention to
produce them or not.

(c) An intent to commit any felony.

“(d) An intent to resist an officer
of justice in the execution of his duty.”

At page 15 of their report they said: “We
have avoided the use of the word ‘malice’ throughout the Draft Code, because
there is a considerable difference between its popular and its legal meaning.
For example, the expression ‘malice aforethought’ in reference to murder has
received judicial interpretation which makes its use positively misleading.”

The concept of ‘malice aforethought’ has been
greatly broadened in modern times. A conviction of murder may now depend upon
the proof of various intents, other than the simple intent to kill.
Nevertheless, the law has consistently required that murder be an offence of
specific intent. The

[Page 974]

specific intents have generally been clearly
described in Canada in statutory form and an unlawful killing without proof of
the existence of the required specific intent has always been characterized as
manslaughter. Murder has been set aside, in a sense, from other crimes and the
law has always required proof of certain mental elements which, in the words
quoted from Kenny above, include “all the various forms of mens rea which
are so heinous that a homicide produced by any of them will be murder”. It is
with this consideration in mind that we must approach the Crown argument, in
this case, to the effect that a conviction of first degree murder could be
found in the absence of proof of any such mental element under s. 213 (d)
of the Criminal Code .

On all the authorities, the mental element—the
malice aforethought of ancient usage—must always be demonstrated in order to
procure a conviction of murder. While I recognize, of course, that Parliament
could remove this requirement, I cannot accept the view that by the enactment
of s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  it has effected such a
fundamental change in the law. It has been observed that a conviction of murder
under s. 213 (a), (b), or (c) depends upon the
commission or attempted commission of an underlying offence and, as well, upon
the existence of the further specific intents mentioned in the
subsection and recited above. Section 213 (d) requires
the commission or attempted commission of an underlying offence, but does not itself
provide for any further intent or ulterior purpose. Therefore the mental
element required for a conviction of murder must be found, in the case of a
murder charged under s. 213 (d), in the intent to commit the
underlying offence. For this purpose it must be shown that the appellant
intended to commit an indecent assault, and in this case that would require
proof that the appellant intended to do the acts which, objectively viewed,
constituted the indecent assault, and that he intended in the commission of the
assault to possess and use a weapon, i.e. a knife.

[Page 975]

Where the underlying offence relied upon by the
Crown is one requiring proof of a specific intent, no question would arise as
to the application of the defence of drunkenness. In such circumstances where
evidence of drunkenness adduced at trial justifies the putting of the defence,
the jury should be directed in accordance with the well-established rules
deriving from Beard’s case, supra, and accepted and approved in
this Court in such authorities as MacAskill v. The King[8], Perrault v. The Queen[9] and Leary v. The Queen, supra; to
the effect that if the evidence left them in doubt as to the capacity of the
accused to form the specific intent required, they would find the accused not
guilty of murder, but they could convict of manslaughter if satisfied that the
killing was unlawful. The problem faced in this case arises because, as is
pointed out above, the underlying offence is one which standing alone requires
only a basic or general intent. In such circumstances, can the defence of
drunkenness be called in aid by the appellant? Martin J.A., in the Court of
Appeal, was of the view that the defence was available. He said:

It is plain from the trial judge’s
observation to counsel during the objections to his charge, that he considered
that the effect of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Leary v.
The Queen, supra, was that drunkenness could not negative the general
intent that suffices for indecent assault, even in the context of that offence
as an ingredient of murder under s. 213 (d). I am, with deference,
unable to accept that view. If the Appellant because of intoxication, was not
conscious of what he was doing, the minimum requirement of criminal liability
for murder under 213(d) was lacking and, as I view the evidence,
the jury should have been so instructed.

I agree with that proposition. The appellant in
this case faced a charge of first degree murder. The jury ought to have been
told by the trial judge that, if having considered the evidence including that
of intoxication they doubted the appellant’s mental capacity to form the intent
required for the completion of the indecent assault because of his state of
intoxication, murder would not have been proved. The result, assuming that the
jury was

[Page 976]

satisfied that the appellant had done the
killing, would be an unlawful killing without the requisite intent for murder
or, in other words, manslaughter.

This approach, in my view, is consistent with
the authorities. Beard’s case limited the defence of drunkenness to
offences requiring a specific intent, and this was accepted as well by a
majority of this Court in Leary but, in my opinion, the Lord Chancellor
in Beard’s case did not go so far as to say that in a case where a conviction
for murder depended upon proof of a second or underlying offence the
unconscious commission of that underlying offence, whatever intent may have
been required for its completion, would suffice to make a subsequent killing
murder. He said, at p. 504:

My lords, drunkenness in this case could be
no defence unless it could be established that Beard at the time of committing
the rape was so drunk that he was incapable of forming the intent to commit it,
which was not in fact, and manifestly, having regard to the evidence, could not
be contended. For in the present case the death resulted from two acts or from
a succession of acts, the rape and the act of violence causing suffocation.
These acts cannot be regarded separately and independently of each other. The
capacity of the mind of the prisoner to form the felonious intent which murder
involves is in other words to be explored in relation to the ravishment; and
not in relation merely to the violent acts which gave effect to the ravishment
(Emphasis added.)

These words have been said to have extended the
defence of drunkenness to offences of general intent. In my view, they do not
have that effect. They, nonetheless, support the proposition that the
underlying offence in constructive murder must have been consciously committed.
In Majewski, Lord Russell of Killowen dealt with these words, at p. 172.
He said in reference to them:

In my opinion these passages do not
indicate an opinion that rape is a crime of special intent. All that is meant
is that conscious rape is required to supply ‘the felonious intent which murder
involves’. For the crime of murder special or particular intent is always
required for the necessary malice aforethought. This may be intent to kill or
intent to cause grevious bodily harm: or in a

[Page 977]

case such as Beard of
constructive malice, this required the special intent consciously to commit the
violent felony of rape in the course and furtherance of which the act of
violence causing death took place. Beard therefore,
in my opinion does not suggest that rape is a crime of special or particular
intent. (Emphasis added.)

It will be seen at once that Lord Birkenhead
would have the accused’s capacity to form the felonious intent considered in
relation to the ravishment, i.e. the underlying offence and not the
violent act which led to the death. From this, I take it, he was of the view
that even in a case of rape which involves only a basic intent the mental
capacity of the accused was a matter for investigation where the rape was to form
the basis of a charge of murder. Furthermore, Lord Russell spoke of the
requirement of the commission of a ‘conscious rape’ in order to warrant a
conviction upon the graver offence of murder which ensued as a result of the
felonious assault. The application of s. 213(d) of the Code cannot
result in a conviction for murder unless the accused person is shown to have
been committing or attempting to commit one of the offences mentioned in the
section. The duty is therefore put upon the Crown to prove the commission or
attempt with all its mental elements as a necessary part of the proof of murder
in order to meet the requirement noted by Lord Russell of proof of the
conscious commission of the underlying offence. If the section did not
require proof of such conscious commission or conscious attempted commission of
one of the offences, it would be providing for a conviction of murder in the
absence of any mental element or intent, or in ancient usage ‘malice
aforethought’ and, to use the words of Martin J.A. in the Court of Appeal… in
the absence of proof of even “the minimum requirement of criminal liability”.
This principle was in the mind of Taschereau J. (as he then was) when he said
in this Court in R. v. King[10], at
p. 749, referring to a charge of impaired driving:

[Page 978]

I entirely disagree with the proposition of
the Crown that whether the accused knew he was impaired or not he must be found
guilty, and that under s. 223  Cr.C ., no mental element has to be considered,
and that the mere fact of impairment is sufficient to create the offence.

It is my view that there can be no actus
reus unless it is the result of a willing mind at liberty to make a
definite choice or decision, or in other words, there must be a willpower to do
an act whether the accused knew or not that it was prohibited by law.

It follows from the foregoing that, like Martin
J.A. in the Ontario Court of Appeal, I am of the opinion that the rule of law
to the effect that voluntary or self-induced intoxication cannot negative a
general intent constituting the only mental element required for an indecent
assault does not apply to the offence of murder where the conviction rests upon
proof of the offence of indecent assault. This conclusion rests upon the
proposition that the appellant was not charged with indecent assault, an
offence in respect of which the defence of drunkenness would not have assisted
him. He was charged with murder, an offence which cannot be complete without
the proof of some mental element which, in a charge of murder resting upon
proof of an underlying offence, as in s. 213(d) of the Code, substitutes
for the specific intent ordinarily required for murder. In this case proof of
such mental element or intent can only be made by proof of an intent to commit
an indecent assault and to use the knife in the commission of the assault.

The third issue, which arises from the earlier
points discussed, is whether there was error in the trial judge’s charge on the
applicability of the defence of drunkenness under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code . Dealing with this question, the trial judge said:

The question of drunkenness to a degree to
render the assailant incapable of forming the specific intents to which I
earlier referred is irrelevant. The issue of drunkenness would only be relevant
if the assailant was so intoxicated as to be unable to form the intent to use
the knife and to form an indecent purpose.

[Page 979]

If you found that he used the knife and had
an indecent purpose, it is hard to conceive how anyone could use a knife and
have an indecent purpose, without having sufficient intellectual capacity to do
so. However, I leave that with you.

Later, the jury returned to the courtroom with a
question, which is reproduced hereunder from exhibit 75 at trial:

We require clarification of the definition
of murder—re first, second and manslaughter with and without the involvement of
alcohol. We would like to have these definitions in writing for further use in
the jury room for our deliberations. Signed, ‘W. Collins’.

The trial judge answered with a restatement of
the law on the points raised. Dealing with the effect of drunkenness, he said:

Now, to come to the third description of
murder, or legal definition of murder, and it is only applicable if the Crown
has satisfied you, beyond reasonable doubt, that the killing occurred in the
course of the commission of the offence of indecent assault. So that
description [sic] of definition of murder is that culpable homicide, the
original concept that I mentioned to you, culpable homicide is murder where a
person causes the death of a human being while committing an indecent assault,
whether or not the person means to cause death to any human being, and whether
or not he knows that death is likely to be caused to any human being if he uses
a weapon during or at the time he commits or attempts to commit the indecent
assault, and the death ensues as a consequence.

Unless you are satisfied, beyond reasonable
doubt, that the assault was for an indecent or sexual purpose, this
section simply doesn’t apply. So if you are convinced, beyond reasonable
doubt, that there was a sexual or indecent purpose, then the killing under this
definition of murder is murder, regardless of whether or not there was an
intent to kill, or an intent to do bodily harm known to be likely to cause
death.

So the law says that when there is a
killing, in carrying out of an indecent assault, that intention is irrelevant;
that it isn’t necessary; it isn’t an essential ingredient of the offence of
murder. And seeing that there is no specific intent required, most of what I
said to you about alcohol is completely irrelevant, and doesn’t have to be
considered, except if a jury was of the view that the person was so drunk that
he was unable to

[Page 980]

form the intention to use a knife, or to
form an indecent or sexual purpose.

And then, after some comments regarding the
necessity of proof of indecent assault to justify a conviction of murder, he
said:

But if you are satisfied, beyond reasonable
doubt, that there was an indecent assault (that is, a sexual or indecent
purpose connected with the assault), then alcohol plays virtually no part,
except in those very limited circumstances that I mentioned.

The jury was later recalled and the trial judge
gave further instructions on the defence of drunkenness, as it applied to the
concept of murder under s. 212 (a) of the Criminal Code , but these
directions are not in issue here.

It will be seen that in the charge he told the
jury the issue of drunkenness would only be relevant if the intoxication
reached the point where the appellant was unable to form the intent to use the
knife and to form an indecent purpose. In his recharge, he referred at one
point to the necessity for a sexual or indecent purpose and later told the jury
that no specific intent was required in this case and, therefore, evidence of
alcohol was completely irrelevant. It will be seen at once that there are
significant inconsistencies in his direction. To begin with, it is error to say
that an indecent assault is one carried out for an indecent purpose. No such
purpose need be shown—if the accused has carried out the acts which,
objectively viewed, constitute the indecent assault. To say later that no
specific intent is required is correct, but nevertheless confusing, considering
the earlier words. In my view, the trial judge should have directed the jury on
s. 212 (a) as he did, and thereafter he should have told the jury that
for a conviction of murder under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code  they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant at
the time of the killing was in the course of committing an indecent assault
upon the deceased, and upon this issue they could consider evidence of
drunkenness. If such evidence left them with a reasonable doubt as to the capacity
of the appellant, because of drunkenness, to form that minimal intent necessary
for the indecent assault, i.e. to possess himself of and to use a weapon
and do the acts which constituted the

[Page 981]

indecent assault they could not convict of
murder, but if otherwise satisfied that the accused had done the killing, they
should convict of manslaughter. It follows then, in my view, that the trial
judge was in error in dealing with the issue of drunkenness in relation to s. 213 (d),
and it remains for us to consider whether the error was such that it led to
a miscarriage of justice or any prejudice to the appellant. We have to decide,
assuming that the trial judge’s direction was not correct in law—and to use the
words of Martin J.A. in the Court of Appeal—: “whether the instruction that the
trial judge gave was in the particular circumstances an equivalent or adequate
instruction”.

In approaching this question, it should be
observed at once that the trial judge, in defining an indecent assault, seems
to have agreed with the submission of counsel for the defence that an indecent
assault was an assault for an indecent or a sexual purpose. He said:

An assault becomes an indecent assault if
it is made for an indecent or sexual purpose. Therefore, the Crown must prove,
beyond reasonable doubt, that the attack upon Miss McKenna was made for a
sexual or indecent purpose. It is a question of fact for you to decide whether
or not the attack which took place upon her was for an indecent or sexual
purpose. You must consider all of the circumstances to decide this, and,
remember, you must give the accused the benefit of any reasonable doubt upon
this issue, as well as all other issues in the case.

If this definition were accepted in law, it
would mean that a conviction for an indecent assault would require proof and a
finding by the jury of the formulation of a sexual or indecent purpose. This
imposes a standard of proof upon the Crown going far beyond what the law
requires. It has been shown above that all that is required for proof of the
offence is proof that the accused did the acts which, objectively viewed,
constituted the indecent assault.

[Page 982]

In explaining the difference between first and
second degree murder, the trial judge said:

The Criminal Code  provides that
murder is first degree murder in respect of a person when the death is caused
by that person while committing an offence of indecent assault. I do not intend
to repeat what I said earlier about indecent assault. If you have found that
the accused has committed the offence of murder, and you are satisfied, beyond
reasonable doubt, that he committed that murder while committing the offence of
indecent assault on Mary McKenna, you must find him guilty of first degree
murder.

If, on the other hand, you have found that
he committed the offence of murder but are not satisfied, beyond reasonable
doubt, that he did so while committing the offence of indecent assault upon
her, you must find him guilty of second degree murder.

It is thus apparent that the jury had been told
that a finding of first degree murder was dependent upon a finding that the
appellant had committed an indecent assault upon the deceased. They had been
told, as well, that only drunkenness rendering the appellant unable to form the
intent to use the knife and to carry out the assault would be relevant in this
issue. They, nevertheless, found a conviction of first degree murder and upon
the application of a test more favourable to the appellant than the law
required. Such a finding makes it clear that the jury was satisfied that all
the elements of indecent assault, including the mental capacity of the
appellant, were proved and I am satisfied that there was no prejudice to the
appellant or miscarriage of justice as a result of any deficiency in the charge
on the issue of drunkenness. It was argued on this point that the trial judge
failed to leave to the jury the option to convict of manslaughter, instead of
murder, if satisfied of the unlawful killing and not satisfied that the
requisite intent for murder had been shown. This option was clearly left to the
jury in respect of murder under s. 212  of the Criminal Code , and not
completely eliminated under s. 213 (d). The judge said:

Members of the jury, if you are satisfied,
beyond reasonable doubt, that the Crown has proved all of the essential
elements contained in any one of those three

[Page 983]

definitions of murder, it is your duty to
find that he has committed the offence of murder.

If you have found that the accused killed
Miss McKenna, you are prevented by law from giving him a complete acquittal.
The least offence of which he can be convicted is manslaughter.

If you have not been satisfied, beyond
reasonable doubt, that the assailant killed Miss McKenna while indecently
assaulting her, you must disregard the third definition of murder that I gave
you.

While the option of manslaughter in respect of
s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  could have been left to the
jury in more explicit terms, in this case the fact that the jury delivered its
verdict of first degree murder indicates that, even applying a test more
favourable to the accused than required by law, they were of the view that the
appellant was capable of the conscious commission of the act and, therefore, no
occasion arose for the consideration of the alternative manslaughter verdict.
The jury had been told that the only way they could convict of first degree
murder was to find the appellant had committed an indecent assault. They were
told, as well, to apply in that determination a test which left out of account
the possibility of any unconscious commission of the assault. In my view, no
reversible error occurred in this connection.

A final point taken by the appellant was set out
in his factum in these terms:

Whether in murder in the commission of an
offence under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  the Crown
must prove two separate criminal acts being (1) the ‘offence’ in this case
indecent assault; and (2) a separate homicidal act causing death.

It was submitted that, for a conviction under s.
213 (d) of the Criminal Code , the Crown must show two
separate acts which in this case would consist of an indecent assault and a
further act which caused the death. The proposition thus advanced was that
causing the death by the act of assault itself would not be sufficient.
Reliance was

[Page 984]

placed for this argument on R. v. Tennant and
Naccarato[11]and R.
v. DeWolfe[12].

I do not consider that either of the two cases
supports the argument and I am unable to find any merit in it. In my opinion,
it confuses the language of s. 212 (c) of the Criminal Code —which
does not require two separate acts but rather a separate unlawful purpose going
beyond the actual act causing death—with the quite different language of s.
213 (d). Section 212(c) of the Code provides
that where a person “for an unlawful object” does anything he knows or ought to
know is likely to cause death, and thereby causes death to a human being, he is
guilty of murder. It is clear, and the cases referred to above hold, as do
others, that there must be an unlawful purpose, other than the killing by the
accused, in the pursuit of which the death occurs by the act of the accused.
Section 213(d) of the Code imposes no such
requirement. Its plain language provides that culpable homicide is murder when
a person causes the death of a human being while committing or attempting to
commit indecent assault, if he uses a weapon or has it upon his person during
or at the time he commits or attempts to commit the offence, or during or at
the time of his flight after committing or attempting to commit the offence,
and death ensues as a consequence. The cases decided under s. 212 (c),
dealing with the requirement of an unlawful purpose during the pursuit of which
a death occurs, can have no application to s. 213 (d) which
requires no such unlawful purpose. For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss
the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Procedure—Committal for
trial—Preferred indictment—Extraordinary remedies to quash committal—Criminal
Code , ss. 507 , 507.1 .

Criminal law—Preliminary hearing—Charge of
second degree murder—Committal for trial for an offence other than the offence
set out in the information—Criminal Code , ss. 463 , 464 , 469 , 473 , 474 , 475 ,
504 , 511 ,589 .

The respondent was committed for trial by a
Provincial Court Judge on a charge of first degree murder at the end of a
preliminary hearing which had been proceeding on the basis of an information
charging the respondent with the offence of second degree murder. On
August 14, 1978, the crown attorney signed an indictment which was lodged
with the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Ontario. On August 18, 1978 before the indictment was
preferred before a trial court, the respondent challenged the committal for
trial by way of an application for habeas corpus with certiorari in
aid. Dupont J., of the Supreme Court of Ontario, dismissed the respondent’s
application but the Court of Appeal set aside the order committing the
respondent for trial on first degree murder and remitted the matter to the
Provincial Court Judge to commit for trial on a charge of second degree murder,
if so advised. The Crown’s appeal to this Court raised two questions: (i) does
an indictment constitute a bar to an accused’s application for habeas corpus
with certiorari in aid challenging his committal for trial and, if
so, at what point does it constitute a bar, and (ii) does a judge conducting a
preliminary inquiry have jurisdiction to commit an accused for trial on the
offence of first degree murder when the information charges the accused with
the offence of second degree murder.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

As to the first question, the Court of Appeal
concluded correctly that at some point the indictment became the operative
document in the criminal process. After presentment of the indictment, the
accused is free to

[Page 986]

move to quash the indictment by motion made
in the trial court but he can no longer attack the regularity of the committal
for trial by certiorari. When an indictment is preferred pursuant so s.
507  without the intervention of the grand jury, there are not separate acts of
preferral of a bill of indictment, and presentment of an indictment. There is
but one act, that act being the placing by the appropriate authority of “an
indictment in writing setting forth the offence” before the trial court. This
act constitutes the commencement of the trial and is a combination of the steps
of preferral and presentment. The simple act of signing and filing the
indictment with the court clerk does not constitute preferment of the
indictment sufficient to bar the right of the accused to challenge his
committal order by way of certiorari. If the simple act of filing were
to be determinative, the accused would be left in the position where his right
to move to quash his committal for trial due to irregularities in the
preliminary inquiry would depend upon the decision of the prosecutor as to the
appropriate moment for filing the indictment. An indictment based upon a
committal for trial without the intervention of a grand jury is not “preferred”
against an accused until it is lodged with the trial court at the opening of
the accused’s trial, with a court ready to proceed with the trial. The mere
presence of the indictment, and of the accused, before the judge in the Assignment Court are not sufficient to
deprive the accused of his right to move to quash his committal. An indictment
is preferred when it is before a court empowered to dispose of the case. In
this case the indictment was never before a trial court constituted to dispose
of the case and it did not bar the respondent’s right to challenge his
committal for trial.

As to the second issue, the inquiry of the
judge presiding a preliminary hearing must be limited to ‘charges’ in
informations outstanding against the accused at the time of the inquiry. If the
scope of the preliminary inquiry were extended beyond actual ‘charges’ to
include rumour or accusations, the basic principles of criminal law would be
subverted. Even if s. 475(1)  of the Criminal Code  gives the power
to the justice to commit “for trial” without imposing any express limitation on
this power, this section must be read in the context of the preceding
sections and the general scheme of Part XV of the Code. Logically,
the power to commit cannot be larger than the power to inquire. Had Parliament
wished to confer on a magistrate the power to commit an accused for any offence
disclosed by the evidence, it could easily have done so in

[Page 987]

clear terms. There is no authority, express
or implied, in the Code to commit for trial on other offences disclosed
by the evidence, whether these offences are related or unrelated to the
original charge, unless it is an included offence.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal
from the dismissal of an application for habeas corpus with certiorari
in aid to quash the committal for trial of the accused on a charge of first
degree murder. Appeal dismissed.

David H. Doherty, for the appellant.

Donald B. Bayne and Alan D. Gold, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—Two questions fall to be decided in
the present appeal: (i) does an indictment constitute a bar to an accused’s
application for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid challenging
his committal for trial and, if so, at what point does it constitute a bar, and
(ii) does a judge conducting a preliminary inquiry have jurisdiction to commit
an accused for trial on the offence of first degree

[Page 988]

murder when the information charges the accused
with the offence of second degree murder.

I

The respondent, Richard Ferdinand Chabot, was
charged in an information that on or about the 27th day of January 1978 at the
City of Ottawa he did
unlawfully kill one Dwayne Weldon Nichol, contrary to the form of the Criminal
Code , s. 214 . A preliminary inquiry proceeded in Ottawa before a judge of the Provincial Court (Criminal Division). Evidence was heard on each of three days. The
Crown concluded its case on the second day and the accused elected to call
evidence. On the third day defence counsel for the first time advanced the
proposition that the information charged the offence of second degree murder
and not first degree murder. Defence counsel was correct, of course, as s. 511
of the Code provides that no person shall be convicted for the offence
of first degree murder unless in the indictment charging the offence he is
specifically charged with that offence. The information did not specifically
charge first degree murder and therefore s. 214(7)  applied: all murder that is
not first degree murder is second degree murder.

Counsel for the Crown advised the court that it
had come as somewhat as a surprise to him that the preliminary hearing had been
proceeding on the basis of an information which did not specifically charge
first degree murder. He nonetheless requested a committal on the more serious
charge. The Court indicated that the defence could call further evidence if so
advised. Defence counsel declined the offer. On August 14, 1978, the judge
concluded he had jurisdiction and committed the respondent for trial on the
charge of first degree murder. The same day the crown attorney signed an
indictment charging the respondent with that offence. The indictment was lodged
with the registrar of the Supreme Court of Ontario at Ottawa.

By notice of motion dated August 18, 1978, returnable September 5, 1978, counsel
for the respondent challenged the committal for trial by

[Page 989]

way of an application for habeas corpus with
certiorari in aid.

On August 21, 1978, the respondent and his
counsel appeared before a judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario in what is
referred to in Ontario as “Assignment Court”, with a view to setting a
date for trial. The presiding judge had the indictment before him and endorsed
it to indicate when trial would commence. Trial did not proceed on the day
assigned. Since the initial appearance the indictment has been dealt with by
various judges of the Supreme Court of Ontario on six
 Assignment Court occasions. The respondent has never
appeared on a fixed trial date; there is no suggestion in the endorsements on
the indictment that he was ever arraigned or asked to plead to the indictment.

The respondent’s application for habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid came before Mr. Justice Dupont on
October 19, 1978 and was dismissed. The judge held that the power to commit for
a more serious offence was supported by a series of cases which suggested that
an accused could be committed for any criminal charge revealed by the evidence.
Though none of the cases specifically authorized committal upon a more serious
charge the power existed, in the opinion of Mr. Justice Dupont, at least
where such other offence is “related” to the initial charge. While the power of
a magistrate to commit for offences other than those specified in the
information was not expressly authorized in the Code, such power was
conferred by “necessary implication”: Doyle v. The Queen[2].

The respondent launched an appeal. The Court of
Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the order committing the respondent for
trial on first degree murder and remitted the matter to the Provincial Court
Judge to commit for trial on a charge of second degree murder, if so advised.
The Court raised, proprio motu, the point as to whether it was open to
the accused to attack his committal for trial once the indictment had been
lodged.

[Page 990]

Brooke J.A., speaking for the Court, held that
the indictment becomes the operative document only when it is “presented” to
the Court and, in the circumstances, presentment had not occurred; the mere
filing of the indictment did not operate as a bar to the accused’s application
for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid.

On the substantive question, the Court held that
the Provincial Court Judge could not commit on any charge disclosed by the
evidence, but only a) upon the offence charged; b) on an included offence, or
c) on an offence which the evidence disclosed the accused probably committed in
the course of the alleged commission of the offence charged, but only where the
evidence is not sufficient to put the accused on trial on the charge as laid.
Brooke J.A. held there was no authority to commit an accused for an offence
more serious than that specified in the information.

The Crown, with leave of this Court, now
appeals.

II

The Indictment as a bar

Does the existence of an indictment at some
point operate as a bar to an attack, by way of habeas corpus with certiorari
in aid, upon the validity of the committal for trial; if so, at what
point does it become a bar?

The Court of Appeal concluded, I think
correctly, that at some point the indictment becomes the operative document in
the criminal process. At that point, the indictment provides a “fresh starting
point”. The indictment in effect becomes the foundation upon which the further
proceedings are built. After presentment of the indictment, the accused is free
to move to quash the indictment by motion made in the trial court but he can no
longer attack the regularity of the committal for trial by certiorari.

[Page 991]

The Crown relies generally on a line of
authority developed during the period when the grand jury was still common in Canada. Under that system anyone, including
the attorney general, could prefer a bill of indictment before the grand jury.
The law did not require any notice to be given to an accused nor was it
necessary to obtain prior authorization before preferring the indictment. The
grand jury would proceed to hear evidence from the witnesses whose names were
endorsed on the back of the indictment. If the jury found that a prima facie
case had been made out, they would return a true bill against the accused,
and the foreman would endorse upon the indictment the words, “a true bill”. If
the jury thought no such case had been made out, the foreman would endorse upon
the indictment the words “no true bill”.

The public return of the bill in open court was
termed the ‘presentment’ of the indictment. When, under the earlier procedure,
an indictment had been presented, the trial of the accused upon the indictment
could then proceed, notwithstanding any irregularities in the proceedings
before the magistrate, these last mentioned proceedings forming no part of the
trial or the indictment: R. v. Nyczyk[3].
See R. v. Botting[4]; Ex
p. Salajko[5]; R.
v. Morin[6]; R.
v. Seguin[7] and Tremeear’s Annotated Criminal Code (6th Ed.) 836.

In nine of the provinces, including Ontario, there is no longer any grand jury;
the attorney general or his agent may now prefer an indictment to the court
following a preliminary inquiry (s. 507(2) of the Code). This new
procedure has raised the problem of the application of the jurisprudence
developed under the grand jury regime. Specifically, at what point can it be
said that an indictment brought under s. 507(2) is ‘presented’ to the court?
When does the indictment become

[Page 992]

the operative document closing the door to a
challenge, by certiorari, to the committal?

I agree with counsel for the Crown that where an
indictment is preferred pursuant to s. 507  without the intervention of the
grand jury, there are not separate acts of preferral of a bill of indictment,
and presentment of an indictment. There is but one act, that act being the
placing by the appropriate authority of “an indictment in writing setting forth
the offence” before the trial court. This act constitutes the commencement of
the trial and is a combination of the steps of preferral and presentment.

The Courts have spoken with less than complete
unison as to the precise moment at which the indictment becomes the operative
document in the proceedings. Broadly speaking, two views emerge from the
authorities. The first is that expressed by Jessup J.A. in the case of R. v.
Elliott[8]. In
that case, in contrast to the instant case, the Crown was arguing that an
indictment was not ‘preferred’ until the accused had actually been arraigned on
the charge. Jessup J.A. dealt with the submission in these words.

It is the result of my view of what
actually transpired at the trial that it is unnecessary to determine the
precise moment at which an indictment must be deemed to be preferred within the
meaning of s. 478. In R. v. Jun Goon et al. (1916),
25 C.C.C. 415, 28 D.L.R. 374, 22 B.C.R. 381 sub nom. Jun Goon, Martin J.A., expressed the view that it is the reading of
the charge to the accused by the clerk which constitutes the preferring of an
indictment as well as the first part of the arraignment, the second part of
which consists in asking the accused whether he is guilty or not. However, I
think it is clear that preferment occurs at an earlier time in proceedings
under ss. 486 and 487. If it were necessary to decide the point I would prefer
the view that an indictment is preferred when it is delivered into the custody
of a Court constituted to try the accused. (p. 106) (Emphasis added.)

This dictum was followd by J. Holland J. in Re
Newstead and Dollan and The Queen (unreported decision of the Ontario High
Court, October 30,

[Page 993]

1979). In that case, the Crown had preferred two
indictments against two accused. The accused had appeared before a trial judge
on a fixed trial date on two occasions but each time the proceedings had been
adjourned. Subsequently, Holland J. heard applications to quash the committals
for trial. He dismissed the applications on the ground that the indictments had
been before a trial court constituted to try the accused and thus it was no
longer open to the accused to challenge the committal for trial directly.

The other view that has emerged on the question
is slightly different. In addition to requiring that the indictment be before a
court ready to try the accused, this approach requires that the indictment actually
shall have been read to the accused and a plea taken before the indictment
becomes the operative document. In Re Beeds and The Queen[9], Disberry J. heard an application to
quash a committal for trial after an indictment had been signed by the attorney
general and filed with the court. Disberry J. concluded that the signing and
filing of the indictment were only administrative acts which did not alter the
right of the accused to challenge his committal. He stated:

I find, following these authorities that
indictments are “preferred” in Court and during the arraignment of the accused
which precedes the commencement of the trial: R. v. Wakeling, Ex. p. Block, [1966]
1 C.C.C. 90 at pp. 93 et seq., 52 W.W.R. 548 sub nom Block v.
Schauerte. It is done by the Clerk reading the indictment to the accused
followed by the question: “How say you, Are you Guilty or Not Guilty”, (p. 470)

This approach was endorsed by the Court of
Appeal of the Province of Alberta in R. v. Philbin and Henderson[10]. In R. v. Deol, Gill and Randev[11] it was held that an indictment had
been preferred when signed, handed to the clerk, and read to the accused.

[Page 994]

Other authorities which have had occasion to
consider the question have not expressed any decided view on the precise moment
at which it can be said that an indictment has been ‘preferred’, but have held
that the simple act of signing the indictment and filing it with the clerk of
the court cannot constitute preferment. One such case is Re Joly and The
Queen[12], a
decision of Mr. Justice Krever of the Ontario High Court. In that case an
indictment had been signed and filed with the Court but no further action had
been taken by the Crown. Krever J. rejected the submission that the accused
could no longer challenge his right to committal:

The first matter to be dealt with is
Mr. Macdougall’s submission that I have no jurisdiction to entertain this
motion because an indictment has now been signed by an Assistant Crown Attorney
as agent for the Attorney General and the applicant is now facing trial under
that indictment and not the order of warrant of committal of the learned
Provincial Court Judge. I do not accept that submission. I do not think
that Ex parte Salajko (1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 368, and Re Stewart et
al. and The Queen (No. 2) (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 281, when read
together, given the issues those cases actually dealt with, fairly give rise to
the proposition that the jurisdiction of a Supreme Court Judge to entertain the
important remedy of habeas corpus is removed simply by the Crown
Attorney’s signing an indictment before the accused, who moves with reasonable
speed after his committal, has in fact served his notice of motion. In this
situation the race cannot be to the swifter. (p. 539) (Emphasis added.)

To the same effect is the judgment of Freedman
J., as he was then, in R. v. Sednyk[13].
In this case the accused sought to quash his committal for trial after the
indictment had been signed and filed. He was to be arraigned on the indictment
in two days time. Freedman J. stated that “notwithstanding the existence of the
indictment, the accused was entitled to bring the present motion” (p. 342). He
proceeded to review the evidence and eventually set aside the committal order
of the provincial court judge.

[Page 995] 

In R. v. Harrigan and Graham[14] (appeal dismissed for want of
jurisdiction[15]),
Mr. Justice Henry of the Supreme Court of Ontario noted the distinction
between s. 505 of the Code (preferral of a bill of indictment before the
grand jury of any court constituted with a grand jury) and s. 507 , with which
we are concerned, where there is no grand jury, saying at p. 64:

While s. 507 bears striking similarities to
s. 505 of the Code (with which I am concerned) it is to be noted that in
provinces where there is provision for a grand jury a bill of indictment is
preferred before the grand jury and the latter presents the indictment to the
court.

There is a distinction between the two
subsections in that where there is no grand jury the indictment is
preferred in the court at the opening of the trial and the accused is thereupon
arraigned whereas under s. 505 the bill of indictment is preferred before the
grand jury before the trial commences and in practice in the absence of the
accused. It is not a part of the trial.

This review of the authorities yields the
following three propositions:

1. The simple act of signing and filing the
indictment with the court clerk does not constitute preferment of the
indictment sufficient to bar the right of the accused to challenge his commital
order.

2. Preferment of the indictment may
occur when the indictment is before a trial court constituted to try the
accused (R. v. Elliott, supra).

3. Alternatively, preferment may
occur when the indictment is read to the accused in open court and he is asked
to plead to the charge (Re Beeds, supra).

This ambiguity in the authorities was not
entirely resolved by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the present case.
The relevant passage in the judgment of Brooke J.A. reads: 

In my opinion the right of the accused to
move against his committal for trial by way of habeas corpus with certiorari
in aid was not affected by the unilateral act of simply signing and filing
a form of indictment in the office of the registrar of the Court. It is only
when the indictment has been presented to the Court that the accused is
indicted and this means more than simply

[Page 996] 

filing an indictment in the office of the
registrar. This was and is the effect of the procedure where there is a grand
jury and I think that parliament intended that the procedure in provinces where
there is no grand jury should be substantially the same. It was for this reason
that parliament equated “presentment” and “preferring” in s. 503  of the Criminal
Code .

Perhaps the grand jury added a safeguard to
the interest of the accused, and so with the abolition of the grand jury it is
much fairer to the accused that there be no technical obstructions to his
challenging his committal for trial down to the time that he may be called upon
to answer the indictment.

Brooke J.A. clearly endorses “proposition 1”
above to the effect that the simple act of filing the indictment cannot affect
the rights of the accused. It is less certain which of propositions 2 or 3 he
accepts.

Following the hearing of this appeal, the Court,
with a view to determining whether any uniform practice prevailed, requested
the attorneys general of the various provinces and of the federal government to
provide information as to the procedures normally followed within their
respective jurisdictions with regard to the drafting and filing of indictments.
The last of such reports containing such information has now come to hand. One
can only conclude upon reading the reports that no uniform practice prevails.
Procedures differ as between provinces and indeed, at times from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction within the provinces and even within a single jurisdiction.
This is not surprising. In the absence of statutory or other directives it is
natural and proper that practices and procedures should develop to meet local
needs and conditions.

In very general terms the normal procedure
appears to be the following:

a) The indictment is usually prepared almost
immediately after the committal for trial and is at once filed with the clerk
of the relevant court; it should be noted, however, that in some jurisdictions
it is never filed; in others, an unsigned copy of the indictment is filed and
the indictment is not signed until the opening of trial.

[Page 997]

b) the accused may or may not be informed when
the indictment is filed with the court. A number of the provinces indicated
that, as a courtesy, a copy of the indictment is mailed to the accused or his
counsel, but British Columbia, Quebec and a number of federal prosecutors
indicated that they did not inform the accused when the indictment is filed.

c) in general, the indictment is first placed
before the court in which the trial is to be held on the actual trial date
itself. At this time the accused is arraigned and a formal plea is entered, but
this practice is not uniform and some jurisdictions have a separate
“arraignment date” at which time the accused is asked to plead to the charge.

d) in a very limited number of jurisdictions an
assignment court is held for the purpose of fixing trial dates.

I regard this evidence as relevant to the
question of the point at which the indictment can be said to have been
‘preferred’. In particular, I regard it as confirming “proposition 1” derived
from analysis of the case law—the simple act of filing an indictment with a
clerk could not operate as a bar to the rights of an accused to challenge his
committal by way of certiorari. As I have indicated, in many
jurisdictions there is no formal procedure for informing the accused as to when
the indictment has been filed with the court. The reports show, unmistakably to
my mind, that, across the country, neither crown counsel nor defence counsel
have considered the mere filing of the indictment to be material.

If the simple act of filing were to be
determinative, the accused would be left in the position where his right to
move to quash his committal for trial due to irregularities in the preliminary
inquiry would depend upon the decision of the prosecutor as to the appropriate
moment for filing the indictment. The right to challenge committal for trial by
prerogative writ would be fleeting indeed. Witness the present case. In the
language of Mr. Justice Krever in Joly, the race would be to the

[Page 998]

swifter. The accused’s remedy should not be left
to the whim of the Crown. I can see little justification for raising technical
obstructions to the right of an accused to attack by prerogative writ his
committal for trial, down to the time when he may be called upon to answer the
indictment.

This leaves a choice between proposition 2 and
proposition 3 as to the point at which the indictment has been ‘preferred’. I
would observe, however, that regardless of which proposition is selected, the
result will be that the respondent in this case would not be precluded from
challenging his committal. There is no suggestion that the indictment has ever
been before a trial court constituted and ready to try him nor has he ever been
arraigned and pleaded to the indictment.

I turn for a moment to s. 507.1(1) which reads:

507.1(1) Where an indictment has been
presented to a court, a judge of the court, if he considers it necessary, may
issue

a) a summons addressed to the accused, or

b) a warrant for the arrest of the accused
to compel the accused to attend before him to answer the charge described in
the indictment.

Crown counsel did not take the point during
argument but it should, I think, be noted that in the French version of the Code,
the opening words of s. 507.1(1) read: “Après le dépot de l’acte
d’accusation…”. Although the French version may be thought to support the
argument that the indictment is presented to the Court when it is deposited or
filed, and thereafter follow sequentially a summons or warrant to compel
attendance and then a trial, I would reject the argument. Section 507.1(1)
is of recent origin. Enacted recently (1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93, s. 59), its purpose, I think, was to provide
statutory authority for compelling attendance by an accused, following
indictment, see Ex. p. McGrath[16]. If it
had been enacted for some other purpose, such as to impose an obligation to
file, the result of which would foreclose challenge to committal for trial, one
would

[Page 999]

have expected this to be spelled out in clearer
language, accompanied by some obligation on the part of the Crown to give
notice to the accused.

It might be thought that the question as to
whether the indictment is preferred when it is before a trial court, or when
the accused has actually been arraigned on the charge, is of purely academic
interest. The general practice, subject to exceptions is that the accused is
arraigned when he appears at trial. In the interests of clarity, however, I
would hold that an indictment based upon a committal for trial without the
intervention of a grand jury is not “preferred” against an accused until it is
lodged with the trial court at the opening of the accused’s trial, with a court
ready to proceed with the trial.

In the days of the grand jury, presentment did
not include the step of reading the indictment in the presence of the accused
and seeking his plea. Presentment was a unilateral act performed in the
accused’s absence by an accusatorial body. I think it is not unimportant to
note that presentment was made in open court by the grand jury to a judge of
the trial court. True, presentment was not to a judge constituted with a petit
jury to try the case. The Crown contends that the placing of an indictment
before a judge in Assignment Court constitutes presentment, with respect, I
disagree. Such judge is not, as I understand the practice, constituted as a
court to try the accused. I agree with Anderson J. when he said in R. v.
Hansen (unreported judgment of the Ontario High Court, March 11, 1980) “it
seems to me excessively technical to say that the mere presence of the
indictment and of the accused, before the judge in the Assignment Court and the
Practice Court are sufficient to deprive the accused of his right to move to
quash his committal. An indictment is preferred when it is before a court
empowered to dispose of the case”.

[Page 1000]

It follows that in this case the indictment was
never before a trial court constituted to dispose of the case and it did not
bar the respondent’s right to challenge his committal for trial.

III

Committal on First Degree Murder

How wide is the scope of a provincial court
judge’s power to commit for trial at a preliminary inquiry? Can the judge
commit for any charge disclosed by the evidence at the hearing? Alternatively,
can he commit only for charges that are ‘related’ to the charge specified in
the information? Can he commit only for the actual offence charged in the
information or an included offence?

Preliminary inquiries have a long history,
dating back at least to the statutes of Philip and Mary in 1554 and perhaps
earlier. By 1 & 2 Phil. & Mary, c. 13, (1554), it was enacted that,
when any person arrested for manslaughter or felony, being bailable by the law,
is brought before two justices they are “to take the examination of the said
prisoner and information of him that brings him of the fact and circumstances
thereof”. This Act, extended the following year, continued until the year 1826
when it was further extended to misdemeanours. It survived until replaced in
1849 by 11 & 12 Vict., c. 42, known as Sir John Jervis’s Act. It is
this latter Act which has guided much of the practice of preliminary inquiries
in Canada.

As Sir James Stephen points out in his History
of the Criminal Law of England, vol. 1, at p. 221, under the procedure
established in the sixteenth century, the magistrate acted the part of a public
prosecutor. The accused person was examined. He was to be fully questioned as
to all the circumstances connected with his supposed offence. Under the
procedure of the nineteenth century he could be asked no questions at all,
though he was invited to make any statement he pleased, being

[Page 1001]

cautioned that it might be taken down and might
be given in evidence against him. The object of the earlier statute, Stephen
says, was to expose and detect a man assumed to be guilty. In the later statute,
the subject was a full inquiry into his guilt or innocence.

It is important to note that the inquiry under
11 & 12 Vict. is broader than that envisaged by our Criminal Code . The
English statute contemplates committal, at the end of the inquiry, for “any
indictable offence”. Many of the Canadian cases appear to treat the preliminary
inquiry as though it were governed by 11 & 12 Vict., c. 42 rather than the
Canadian Criminal Code.

One of the early Canadian authorities is R.
v. Mooney[17] in
which Madore J. held that since there was no law prohibiting a justice from
committing an accused for trial on charges other than those specified in the
information, that the judge had such power.

Another early authority is R. v. Philips[18] a decision of Boyd, C. of the Ontario
High Court. Relying upon R. v. Brown[19],
the judge held that “the scope of the (preliminary) inquiry may be enlarged
and matters touched upon beyond the scope of the original charge”.

This line of authority has been followed on
numerous occasions in Canada. Some of these cases which have discussed the
issues include the following: R. v. Beaudoin[20]; Re Shumiatcher[21]; R. v. Botting[22]; Re Carriere, Preet and Davidson[23]; R. v. Monkman[24]; Eusler and Budovitch and The Queen[25].

[Page 1002] 

Brooke J.A. in the present case reviewed these
cases. He pointed out, quite rightly in my view, that none of them engaged in a
comprehensive review of the relevant Criminal Code  provisions. They
proceeded either on the footing that a magistrate had such power because it was
not expressly denied him by the Code; or on the basis that the power to
commit had been recognized by the British case of Brown. The cases which
purport to apply Brown to the Canadian scene are, at best, of dubious
authority.

It is critical, as it seems to me, to commence
the inquiry with an analysis of the provisions of the Code. If the power
to commit for trial on offences other than those specified in the information
exists, such power must be found in the Code, either expressly or by
necessary inplication. This is evident from the opinion of Mr. Justice
Ritchie in Doyle v. The Queen, supra, at p. 602, where he stated:

Whatever inherent powers may be possessed
by a superior court judge in controlling the process of his own Court, it is my
opinion that the powers and functions of a magistrate acting under the Criminal
Code  are circumscribed by the provisions of that statute and must be found
to have been thereby conferred either expressly or by necessary implication.

It is conceded by the Crown that nowhere is a
power to commit for a greater offence expressly conferred by the Code. The
question therefore becomes, is it manifest that Parliament conferred such power
by necessary implication?

Provincial Court Judge Bordeleau founded his
decision on s. 463 of the Code. This section provides:

463. Where
an accused who is charged with an indictable offence is before a justice, the
justice shall, in accordance with this Part, inquire into that charge and any
other charge against that person. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 449.

Judge Bordeleau held that the words “and any
other charge against that person” gave him the power to commit the accused for
first degree murder.

[Page 1003]

Dupont J., in the Ontario High Court, concurred
with the result but disagreed with the interpretation of s. 463 . Dupont J.’s
opinion was that s. 463  did not purport to deal with preliminary inquiries at
all, and thus could not be the authority for a committal. In his opinion,
authority for holding a preliminary inquiry is found in s. 464(4) which reads
in part as follows:

Where an accused does not elect to be tried
by a magistrate, the justice shall hold a preliminary inquiry into the charge…

Dupont J. noted that s. 464(4) speaks of an
inquiry into “the charge”, as opposed to s. 463  which speaks of an inquiry into
“that charge and any other charge”. He held, however, this difference in
wording did not mean that the provincial court judge could only commit for
trial on “the charge”; the power to commit for other offences could be derived
by ‘necessary implication’ from the Code.

In the Court of Appeal, Brooke J.A. disagreed
both with the interpretation of ss. 463 and 464(4) and with the result reached
by Dupont J. Brooke J.A. stated that s. 464(4) only dealt with a preliminary
inquiry in circumstances where the accused had a right of election to be tried
by other than a magistrate. Thus s. 463 must deal with the scope of the
preliminary inquiry; otherwise, “there is no authority in the Criminal Code  for
the holding of the preliminary inquiry in a charge such as the one before the
Court in this case”.

Brooke J.A. did not accept the view that s. 463
entitled the judge to inquire into and commit on any offence which might be
disclosed by the evidence; in his opinion the words “any other charge” in s.
463 refer to “charge or charges in other informations outstanding against him
at the time. These charges are specific and are the limit of the inquiry”. He
went on to hold, as I have indicated earlier, that this entitled the judge to
commit for an included offence or, in some circumstances, for a ‘related
offence’, but not for an offence more serious than that laid out in the
information. Accordingly, he quashed the committal for trial on first degree
murder.

[Page 1004]

The word “charge” is not defined in the Code.
In In re Criminal Code[26] this
Court considered the Criminal Code Amendment Act 1907, (Can.), c. 8 and
in particular s. 873A, in very similar terms to present s. 507(1).
Section 873A read:

873A. In the provinces of Saskatchewan and
Alberta, it shall not be necessary to prefer any bill of indictment before a
grand jury, but it shall be sufficient that the trial of any person charged
with a criminal offence be commenced by a formal charge in writing setting
forth as in an indictment the offence with which he is charged.

Idington J. said, p. 448:

It deals only with the case of “the trial
of any person charged with a criminal offence”. How charged? Is it confined to
those who have been judicially so charged, by virtue of the provisions of the
law for committing the accused for trial?

How can it mean aught else? The word
“charged” is the apt one to designate a person accused and in charge. Doubtless
it has another meaning, but it may well be argued that it is in this restricted
sense that the Act applies it.

In R. v. D’Eyncourt[27], Field J. at p. 119 said:

I am of the opinion that the word ‘charged’
[in the Metropolitan Police Courts Act 1839, s. 29 (repealed; see now Police
(Property) Act 1897, s. 1(1))] must be read in its known legal sense, namely,
the solemn act of calling before a magistrate an accused person and stating, in
his hearing, in order that he may defend himself, what is the accusation
against him.

In Stirland v. Director of Public
Prosecutions[28], it
was held that “charged” for the purposes of the Criminal Evidence Act (1898)
(U.K.), c. 36, s. (f) meant accused before a court and in Arnell v.
Harris[29], “person
charged” was taken to mean at least accused of some felony or misdemeanour.
Black’s Law Dictionary (5th ed.) defines “charge”, for the purposes of
the criminal law, as “Accusation of a crime by a formal complaint, information

[Page 1005] 

or indictment”, and in Jowitts Dictionary of
English Law (2nd ed.) the word is given the following meaning, among
others, “to prefer an accusation against anyone”.

It is contended by the Crown that when s. 463 of
the Code speaks of inquiry into “that charge” reference is made to the
formal written charge but when the section speaks of “any other charge
against that person” the word “charge” takes on another meaning namely, “any
other allegation which arises during the course of the inquiry. This allegation
may arise out of the evidence and need not be in existence at the outset of the
inquiry”. I quote from the Crown factum. Although occasionally it is necessary
to give a word a somewhat different meaning in different parts of an enactment
it would be strange, it seems to me, to give a word different meanings in the
same section of an enactment and indeed on the same line of the section.
As the Supreme Court of the United States observed in United States v.
Patterson[30] (at
p. 68) a criminal charge, strictly speaking, exists only when a formal
written complaint has been made against the accused and a prosecution
initiated. “In the eyes of the law a person is charged with crime only when he
is called upon in a legal proceeding to answer to such a charge.”

There is another aspect of the Crown’s argument
which gives concern. Although a preliminary hearing is not a trial it must be
conducted in a judicial manner (Patterson v. The Queen[31] (at p. 412). The rules of evidence
relating to relevancy apply to preliminary hearings in the same manner as to
trials. I would question the relevance, and therefore the admissibility, of
evidence relating to a charge other than that formally spelled out in the
information.

[Page 1006]

The argument is advanced that the combined
effect of ss. 473 and 474 of the Code is to provide that a justice may
hear evidence relating to a charge or charges different from those set forth in
the information. These sections read as follows:

473. The
validity of any proceeding at or subsequent to a preliminary inquiry is not
affected by

(a) any irregularity or
defect in the substance or form of the summons or warrant,

(b) any variance between the
charge set out in the summons or warrant and the charge set out in the
information, or

(c) any variance between the charge
set out in the summons, warrant or information and the evidence adduced by the
prosecution at the inquiry.

474. Where
it appears to the justice that the accused has been deceived or misled by any
irregularity, defect or variance mentioned in section 473 , he may adjourn
the inquiry and may remand the accused or grant him interim release in
accordance with Part XIV.

Although the argument has considerable force, I
do not think it is tenable when one has regard to the other sections of
Part XV of the Code. The “Variance” of which s. 473 (c) speaks
must, I think, be regarded as a variance in respect of such matters as names,
places, dates, and the like. The sweep of ss. 473  and 474  is limited. In my
view it is not such as to authorize an inquiry at large into not only the
offence specifically charged but also all information charges in respect of
which the Crown may choose to lead evidence. An accusation does not exist in
latent form. A person is charged or he is not. The charge or charges into which
a justice may inquire must be in existence at the time the preliminary inquiry
commences. See also Salhany, Canadian Criminal Procedure (3rd ed.) at p.
100: Pursuant to the authority conveyed by s. 463 “The justice before whom the
accused is brought must inquire into any charge pending against the
accused”. (Emphasis added.)

Emphasis on ‘the charge’ is repeated through
Part XV of the Code. Section 465(1)(h) provides:

[Page 1007]

A justice acting under this Part may grant
or refuse permission to the prosecutor or his counsel to address him in
support of the charge, by way of opening or summing up or by way of reply
upon any evidence that is given on behalf of the accused;

This provision only makes sense if one assumes
that the inquiry must be limited to ‘the charge’ in the information; otherwise
one is faced with the anomalous situation that the court would be entitled to
inquire into other matters but crown counsel could only address the court with
respect to ‘the charge’.

Section 469(1) provides, in part:

When the evidence of the witnesses called
on the part of the prosecution has been taken down and, where required by this
Part, has been read, the justice shall address the accused as follows or to the
like effect:

“Having heard the evidence, do you wish to
say anything in answer to the charge?...”

Again, this section is only intelligible if
one assumes that the scope of the inquiry is limited to ‘the charge’ as laid in
the information; otherwise one would have a situation in which an accused would
be asked to answer ‘the charge’ when in reality he was in danger of being
committed for another offence; the caution in s. 469(1) would serve only to
confuse and mislead.

I do not think that, in this case, anything
turns upon whether s. 463 purports to deal with a preliminary inquiry or merely
with an initial mandatory inquiry by the justice after the accused has been
arrested, directed at determining whether the charge is one over which the
justice had absolute jurisdiction. On either view, I agree with the Court of
Appeal that such an inquiry must be limited to ‘charges’ in informations
outstanding against the accused at the time of the inquiry. As Brooke J.A.
pointed out, this view is consistent with basic principles of criminal law
which require that a warrant should issue for arrest on a specific charge, that
the arrest should be executed on that basis, and that the charge be specified
with particularity in the information so that the accused

[Page 1008]

knows the charge against him and what he has to
meet. If the scope of the preliminary inquiry were extended beyond actual
‘charges’ to include rumour or accusations, these basic principles of our law
would be subverted. A preliminary inquiry is not, and should not become, an
inquisition into any and all misdeeds of the accused, whether “charged” against
him or not.

The power to commit the accused for trial is
found in s. 475(1)  which provides:

475. (1)
When all the evidence has been taken by the justice he shall,

(a) if in his opinion the
evidence is sufficient to put the accused on trial,

(i) commit the accused for trial, or

(ii) order the accused, where it is a
corporation, to stand trial in the court having criminal jurisdiction; or

(b) discharge the accused, if
in his opinion upon the whole of the evidence no sufficient case is made out to
put the accused on trial.

Crown counsel properly observes that this
section gives the power to the justice to commit “for trial” without
imposing any express limitation on this power. However, I think the
section must be read in the context of the preceding sections and the
general scheme of Part XV of the Code. Logically, the power to
commit cannot be larger than the power to inquire. If the justice is entitled
to inquire into the ‘charge’ then he must commit on that charge or not at all.

Had Parliament wished to confer on a magistrate
the power to commit an accused for any offence disclosed by the evidence, it
could easily have done so in clear terms. The failure to specify such a power
in s. 475  is not due to inadvertence. Later sections dealing with the
power of the Crown to prefer an indictment expressly contemplate such power. In
s. 496 (2)(b), for example, it is provided that the attorney general, in
certain circumstances, may prefer an indictment which includes counts “relating
to offences disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry…”.

[Page 1009]

A similar provision is included in s. 504 , which
deals with procedure before a court constituted with a grand jury. Parliament
clearly adverted to a power such as is argued for by the Crown in the present
case. Parliament chose expressly to provide such power in ss. 496  and 504 . No
such power was intended under s. 475 .

I conclude, therefore, that a justice conducting
a preliminary inquiry may inquire into, and commit only on, the charge
specified in the information or informations. This includes any ‘included
offences’ since included offences necessarily form part of the original charge:
s. 589(1)  of the Criminal Code .

The Ontario Court of Appeal went on to consider
another question; whether the accused could be committed for trial on a
‘related charge’ I have never been too clear as to what is comprehended by the
phrase “related charge”. The Court of Appeal cited R. v. Monkman, supra. Here
the accused had been charged with assault causing bodily harm but at the
preliminary inquiry these charges were dismissed and the accused was committed
on a charge of criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle. On
appeal, it was held that the committal was justified since, on the particular
facts of the case, the charge of criminal negligence was ‘related’ to the
charge of assault causing bodily harm. Mr. Justice Brooke’s conclusion on
the point was that the accused could be committed for “an offence which the
evidence discloses the accused probably committed in the course of the alleged
commission of the offence with which he is charged but only where the evidence
is not sufficient to put the accused on trial on the charge as laid”. Such a
conclusion was said to flow “by necessary implication” from the relevant
provisions of the Criminal Code . With great respect, I cannot perceive
how the distinction sought to be made can be said to flow from the provisions
of the Code.

It seems to me that once it is determined that
the justice may commit on “the charge” and not on “other offences disclosed by
the evidence”, the logical conclusion is that the justice may commit on ‘the
charge’ and nothing else. Simply put, there

[Page 1010]

is no authority, express or implied, in the Code
to commit for trial on other offences disclosed by the evidence, whether
these offences are ‘related’ or ‘unrelated’ to the original charge. I would
hold that a justice holding a preliminary inquiry can only commit for the
charge as laid in the information or informations and included offences.

I would dismiss the appeal and remit the matter
back to the provincial court judge to commit for trial on the charge of second
degree murder, if so advised.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Police officer suspecting
accused might be impaired driver—Demand for breath sample for road-side
testing—Refusal to comply without presence of lawyer—Accused at no time
“detained” within meaning of Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44,
s. 2(c)—No reasonable excuse for failure to comply—Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, s. 234.1(2).

The appellant was charged that he failed to
comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer under s. 234.1 (2)  of
the Criminal Code  and was convicted by a Provincial
 Court judge. The appellant then appealed his
conviction to the District Court of Alberta and his appeal was allowed and the
conviction quashed. On appeal by the Crown, the Alberta Court of Appeal allowed
the appeal and restored the conviction and sentence of the Court of first
instance. The appellant then appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal
to this Court.

The accused had been driving his car in an erratic
manner and was stopped by a peace officer. After asking the accused to perform
some sobriety tests, and suspecting that he might be an impaired driver, the
officer read him the road-side test demand to provide a breath sample into an
approved screening device. The appellant appeared to understand the demand, but
was continually asking questions. The appellant then refused to provide a
sample of his breath, stating that he wanted his lawyer present on the street
before he did any tests. The peace officer thereafter wrote out an appearance
notice for impaired driving and refusing to provide a breath sample into the
road-side testing device, and the appellant was permitted to leave with a
companion who drove his motor vehicle.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The submission that when the appellant
brought his vehicle to a stop in compliance with a signal from the

[Page 472]

peace officer and during the time when the
peace officer, with the appellant’s ready co‑operation, subjected him to
certain sobriety tests and subsequently read him the “road‑side tester
demand to provide a breath sample”, the appellant was being “detained” within
the meaning of s. 2(c) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, and
that this detention afforded him “reasonable excuse” for refusing to comply
with the demand to provide a breath sample within the meaning of
s. 234.1(1)  of the Criminal Code  could not be accepted.

The words “detain” and “detention” as they
are used in s. 2(c) of the Bill of Rights connote
some form of compulsory restraint. The language of s. 2(c)(iii)
which guarantees to a person “the remedy of habeas corpus for the
determination of the validity of his detention and for his release if the
detention is not lawful” clearly contemplates that any person “detained” within
the meaning of the section is one who has been detained by due process of
law. This construction is supported by reference to ss. 28(2) (b), 30 ,
136 (a), 248  and 250  of the Criminal Code  where the words “to
detain” are consistently used in association with actual physical restraint. In
the present case, the appellant, after he had co-operated in furnishing the
preliminary sobriety tests, was allowed to go away and he was at no time
detained.

The appellant was not a person who had while
“arrested or detained” been deprived of the right to “retain counsel without
delay”, and there was no reasonable excuse for his failure to comply with the
demand made to him by the peace officer.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta allowing an appeal from
a judgment of McFayden J., in the District Court, and restoring the conviction
entered against the appellant by His Honour Judge Forbes in the Provincial
Judges Court on a charge that the appellant

“… on or about the 17th day of September 1977 at
the City of Edmonton in the Province of Alberta, without reasonable excuse, did
unlawfully fail to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer under
s. 234.1(2)  of the Criminal Code ”

At the trial before Judge Forbes it was admitted
on behalf of the appellant that the facts read into the record by the Crown
constituted the whole of the evidence in this case. In view of the fact that
each case involving the construction and effect to be given to s. 234.1(2) 
and s. 235  of the Criminal Code  is dependent on the particular
facts giving rise to the alleged offence, I think it desirable that the
admitted evidence should be reproduced in full. The following statement of
facts was read into the record in accordance with the agreement of counsel:

Your Honour, at approximately 3:55 a.m.,
Sergeant Tidridge noted a 1977 Volaré, red over black, travel south on 50th
Street; and as it turned east onto 114th Avenue, it nearly ran over the
southeast curb. The vehicle straightened out; and then Sergeant Tidridge paid
particular attention to it as it travelled east on 114th
 Avenue. It was seen that the vehicle had a distinct
weave inasmuch as it moved from side to side a complete vehicle width. It took
approximately a 100 feet to accomplish this weave; and as it did so, it moved
completely to the left of the unmarked center line and then to the right,
almost striking cars parked at the south curb, 114th
 Avenue. Sergeant Tidridge applied the interior red
light of the police vehicle, and noted that, although the vehicle reacted
almost immediately, it took a long time to finally come to a halt, spending
some time edging along the

[Page 474]

curb before finally coming to this stop.

Sergeant Tidridge approached the driver’s door
and the accused stepped from the vehicle, staggering slightly as he did so. On
closer checking, Sergeant Tidridge noted his breath smelled strongly of an
intoxicating liquor; beer, as a matter of fact. He was asked whether he was
drinking: He denied it; produced his documents plus one credit card; did this
without too much difficulty. He was not exactly sure of where he was, but he
was not lost. He was driving a friend home.

Sergeant Tidridge asked the accused to perform
some sobriety tests, the first one being the balance test; and he had to sort
of jog to keep his balance. Walking was fair: Asked him to walk ten paces; some
slight sway from normal. Turning wasn’t done. Finger to nose touch, finger to
nose test: he did quite well. The tests were carried out on a dry, paved road
surface. His attitude was co-operative. Speech was noted to be slurred.

Sergeant Tidridge felt that the accused might be
an impaired driver and he was read the road‑side tester demand to provide
a breath sample into a road-side approved testing device. He appeared to
understand but was continually asking questions. Sergeant Tidridge explained
the best he could. He, in essence, refused, saying he wanted his lawyer present
on the street before he did any tests. Sergeant Tidridge wrote out an
appearance notice for impaired driving and requested that the accused sign the
same and indicated that it was an offence not to do so, and that he was merely
signing a receipt of receiving an appearance notice. He declined to sign the
appearance notice; as a result, Sergeant Tidridge just gave him the appearance
notice without having it signed. And in view of the fact that there was a
companion of the accused that was sober, he was allowed to go.

All this took place in the City of Edmonton, in
the Province of Alberta. The vehicle was

[Page 475]

checked and found to be, as one would expect
with a 1977 vehicle, in excellent condition. It was left in the care of the
friend.

That’s the facts, Your Honour.

The defence rested upon the effect to be given
to s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code  in light of s. 2(c)(ii)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights. Section 2 of that enactment reads in
part as follows:

2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is
expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate
notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied
as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation,
abridgment or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized
and declared, and in particular, no law of Canada shall be construed or applied
so as to…

(c) deprive a person who has been
arrested or detained…

(ii) of the right to retain and instruct
counsel without delay, or

(iii) of the remedy by way of habeas
corpus for the determination of the validity of his detention and for his
release if the detention is not lawful;

Section 234.1  subs. (2) under which the
appellant is charged in the present case is to be read in the context of
s. 234.1  subs. (1). These subsections read as follows:

234.1(1) Where a peace officer reasonably
suspects that a person who is driving a motor vehicle or who has the care or
control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, has alcohol in his
body, he may, by demand made to that person, require him to provide forthwith
such a sample of his breath as in the opinion of the peace officer is necessary
to enable a proper analysis of his breath to be made by means of an approved
road-side screening device and, where necessary, to accompany the peace officer
for the purpose of enabling such a sample of his breath to be taken.

(2) Every one who, without reasonable
excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer
under subsection (1) is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence
punishable on summary conviction and is liable

(a) for a first offence, to a
fine of not more than two thousand dollars and not less than fifty dollars or
to imprisonment for six months or to both;

[Page 476]

(b) for a second offence, to
imprisonment for not more than one year and not less than fourteen days; and

(c) for each subsequent offence, to
imprisonment for not more than two years and not less than three months.

As Mr. Justice Clement said in the course
of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the Appeal
Division:

Section 234.1  has an operational
relationship to s. 235  and is cast in a similar language mold. The
relevant cases on the latter section require examination for such
assistance as they may afford.

In fact the penalty provisions (subs. (2)) of
the two sections are identical and the essential difference between the
two sections is that s. 234.1  provides procedure requiring the driver
of a motor vehicle to provide breath samples for analysis in a roadside
screening device, whereas in s. 235  the procedure relates to the
furnishing of a sample for analysis by a qualified technician. For the purposes
of the present appeal I share the view of Mr. Justice Clement that the
cases which have been decided in relation to s. 235  are relevant for
consideration here.

The contention advanced on behalf of the
appellant, and supported by the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge
was that when the appellant brought his vehicle to a stop in compliance with a
signal from the peace officer and during the time when the peace officer, with
the appellant’s ready co-operation, subjected him to certain sobriety tests and
subsequently read him the “road-side tester demand to provide a breath sample”,
the appellant was being “detained” within the meaning of s. 2(c) of
the Bill of Rights, and that this detention afforded him “reasonable
excuse” for refusing to comply with the demand to provide a breath sample
within the meaning of s. 234.1(1)  of the Criminal Code .

The main issues raised by the appellant’s
defence are:

(1) Did the circumstances in which he refused to
supply a sample of his breath to the peace officer afford him a “reasonable

[Page 477]

excuse” for such refusal within the meaning of
s. 234.1 (1)  of the Criminal code ?

(2) Was he at any time “arrested or detained” by
the peace officer within the meaning of s. 2(c)(ii) of the Bill
of Rights?

In support of the contention that the
circumstances here afforded a “reasonable excuse” to the appellant for his
refusal to comply with the peace officer’s request for a sample of his breath,
reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in Brownridge v. The
Queen[2], where
it was held that the denial of the right to retain and instruct counsel without
delay to an accused person who is under arrest and in jail afforded that person
reasonable excuse for refusing to comply with the demand made pursuant to
s. 235(2).

It will be readily appreciated that the
circumstances of the Brownridge case are startlingly different from
those disclosed by the statement of facts read into the record in the present
case. In the case of Brownridge he had been arrested and was being held in the
police cells at the time when his request to instruct counsel was refused,
whereas in the present case the appellant, having complied with the peace
officer’s “sobriety tests” was allowed to go away and was not thereafter
detained. The difference between the two cases constitutes a striking example
of the following proposition stated by Freedman J.A., as he then was, in R.
v. Ballegeer[3], at
p. 355, where he said:

There may be cases in which a debatable
question arises as to whether the accused’s right of communicating with his
lawyer was unduly delayed or hampered by the police. Such a question would have
to be resolved upon its particular facts, with due regard to matters of time,
place, availability of means of communication, and the like. This, however, is
not such a case; in my view no debatable question arises.

[Page 478]

The case of Hogan v. The Queen[4] to which reference was also made in
the Courts below, like Brownridge, is clearly distinguishable from the
present case. There the initial demand for a sample of breath was made on the
highway and it was only after the accused had complied with the peace officer’s
request to accompany him to the police station that the accused stated that he
wanted to see his lawyer before giving the breath sample. In the result the
sample was given upon the constable advising the accused that he had no right
to see anybody before giving it. Under these circumstances, the evidence of the
result of the breath test was admitted at trial.

In support of the contention that the appellant
was “arrested” or “detained” within the meaning of s. 2(c) of
the Bill of Rights when he refused to comply with the peace officer’s
demand, reliance is placed on behalf of the appellant on the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in R. v. MacDonald[5], where MacDonald J.A. stated at
p. 356:

Parliament in using the words “arrested or
detained” in s. 2(c) of the Canadian Bill of Rights contemplated
different situations because although arrest includes detention, detention does
not necessarily include arrest.

It appears to me to be obvious that the word
“detention” does not necessarily include arrest, but the words “detain”
and “detention” as they are used in s. 2(c) of the Bill
of Rights, in my opinion, connote some form of compulsory restraint and I
think that the language of s. 2(c) (iii) which guarantees to
a person “the remedy of habeas corpus for the determination of the
validity of his detention and for his release if the detention is not lawful”,
clearly contemplates that any person “detained” within the meaning of the
section is one who has been detained by due process of law. This
construction is supported by reference to ss. 28(2) (b), 30 , 136 (a),
248  and 250  of the Criminal Code  where the words “to detain” are
consistently used in association with actual physical restraint.

[Page 479]

I agree with the Court of Appeal that the
following observations made by Pigeon J. in the Brownridge case are
pertinent to s. 234.1(1)  and to the facts disclosed in this case.
Notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Justice Pigeon spoke in the course of a
dissenting opinion, I do not think that this statement is in any way in
variance to the principle to which I have just referred. Mr. Justice
Pigeon said, at pp. 943 and 944:

The legal situation of a person who, on
request, accompanies a peace officer for the purpose of having a breath test
taken is not different from that of a driver who is required to allow his
brakes to be inspected or to proceed to a weighing machine under s. 39(6)
or s. 78(3) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1970, c.202. Such a
person is under a duty to submit to the test. If he goes away, or attempts to
go away, to avoid the test, he may be arrested and charged but this does not
mean that he is under arrest until this happens. He is merely obeying
directions that police officers are entitled to issue. Motorists cannot
reasonably expect to be allowed to seek legal advice before complying with such
orders. Police officers are fully justified in treating as a definitive refusal
a refusal to comply until legal advice is obtained.

Does s. 2(c) (ii) of the
Bill of Rights alter the common law situation with respect to motorists
requested to submit to a test required by the Criminal Code  as opposed
to tests required by provincial legislation? I do not think so. The provision
under consideration applies to “a person who has been arrested or detained”.
Such is not, it appears to me, the legal situation of one who has been required
“to accompany” a peace officer for the purpose of having a breath test taken.
The test may well be negative and, in such a case, it would be quite wrong to
say that this person was arrested or detained and then released. Detained means
held in custody as is apparent from such provision as s. 15 of the Immigration
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.I-2.

The observations of Macdonald J.A. in R. v.
MacDonald, supra, are to be read in light of the fact that in the result he
allowed the Crown’s appeal and made the following statement at p. 358:

In the case at bar it is my opinion that the
right of the respondent to retain and instruct counsel was not abridged
or infringed. In order for such right to be

[Page 480]

abridged or infringed some overt act would
appear to be required and indeed, contemplated by the Canadian Bill of
Rights. No such overt act existed here. What occurred was that although the
right to retain and instruct counsel was not abridged or infringed, the
respondent was unable to exercise the right due to his inability to make
contact with any of the three lawyers he telephoned. It must also be remembered
that before refusing to comply with the demand given him by Constable
Brown he apparently abandoned his efforts and hence his request to contact
counsel and advised Constable Brown that for the reason, inter alia, that
he had been unsuccessful in contacting any of the three lawyers he had tried to
reach by telephone that he was not in effect going to comply with the demand.

In the present case after the appellant had
co-operated in furnishing the preliminary sobriety tests he was allowed to go
away, and as I have indicated, I am of opinion that he was at no time detained.

In view of all the above, I have concluded that
the appellant was not a person who had, while “arrested or detained” been
deprived of the right to “retain and instruct counsel without delay” and I am
unable to find any reasonable excuse for his failure to comply with the demand
made to him by the peace officer.

I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

Criminal law—Murder—Admissibility of
evidence—Hearsay—Statements made by the deceased—Statements not part of res
gestae—Duty of trial judge—Adequacy of charge.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland,

and ordering a new trial. Appeal dismissed.

M. Francis O’Dea and J. Burke, for the
appellant.

John P. Byrne, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally
by

MARTLAND J.—The submissions made by counsel for
the appellant have not persuaded us to reverse the judgment of the Court of
Appeal. The charge to the jury in this case was wholly unsatisfactory for the
reasons given by Gushue J.A., in the Court of Appeal.

Some comment should be made regarding the
admissibility of the evidence of the appellant as to the threats which the
appellant says were made by the deceased to commit suicide by taking an
overdose of sleeping pills. The appellant testifies that these threats were
made in December 1974, February 1975, on another unspecified date, and on the
date of her death, October 21, 1975. We agree with the Court of Appeal that
evidence regarding the alleged threat made on the date of the death of the
deceased was admissible. However, the trial judge had a duty to warn the jury
as to the risk involved in accepting this evidence when given by the accused.
The three alleged threats made earlier

[Page 1015]

were not a part of the res gestae, and,
in relation to the circumstances of this case, the mental condition of the
deceased at the time when they were said to have been made was not an issue
before the Court.

The appeal is dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL

Prisons Censorship of prisoners' mail — Right of prison
inmates to communicate in confidence with their solicitors — Solicitor-client
privilege — Inmate failing to establish entitlement to a declaration —
Penitentiary Service Regulations, SOR/62-90 — Canadian Bill of Rights,
1960(Can.), c. 44, ss. 1(b), (d), 2(c)(ii).

The appellant, imprisoned at Millhaven Institution,
commenced an action in the Federal Court of Canada for a declaration that
""properly identified items of correspondence directed to and received from
his solicitor shall henceforth be regarded as privileged corre­spondence and
shall be forwarded to their respective destinations unopened"". The action
was dismissed and on appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal the pleadings were
amended to request a declaration "" ... that hence-forth all properly
identified items of solicitor-client correspondence should be forwarded to
their respective destinations unopened"". The appeal failed, and at the
opening of the appeal in this Court counsel for the appellant moved to
substitute, for the prayer for relief in the statement of claim, a declaration
that the order of the Director of Millhaven Institution that the appellant's
mail be opened and read ""insofar as it has been applied to mail
originating from his solicitor David Cole, and to mail written by the Plaintiff
to his solicitor David Cole, is not authorized by law"".

In accordance with the Penitentiary Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. P-6, and Regulations thereunder, an institutional head of a
penitentiary may order censorship of inmate corre­spondence to the extent
considered necessary or desirable for the rehabilitation of the inmate or the
security of the institution. The main ground upon which the appellant rested
his case was solicitor-client privilege.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 822]

Contrary to the views expressed by the Court below,
the important issues raised in this case should not be determined by the
particular form of wording employed in the prayer for relief, or on the basis
that the question is hypothetical.

There could be no doubt that there was a real, and
not a hypothetical, dispute between the parties. The declaration sought was a
direct and present challenge to the censorship order of the Director of
Millhaven Institute. That order, so long as it continues, from the past through
the present and into the future, is in contro­versy. The fact that a
declaration today cannot cure past ills, or may affect future rights, cannot of
itself, deprive 'the remedy of its potential utility in resolving the dispute
over the Director's continuing order. Once one accepts that the dispute is real
and that the granting of judg­ment is discretionary, then the only further
issue is whether the declaration is capable of having any practi­cal effect in
resolving the issues in the case. The deter­mination of the right of prison
inmates to correspond, freely and in confidence with their solicitors, is of
great practical importance, although, admittedly, any such determination
relates to correspondence not yet written. However poorly framed the prayer for
relief may be, even as twice amended, the present claim was clearly directed to
the procedures for handling prison mail and the invocation in relation thereto
of solicitor-client privilege.

Recent case law has taken the traditional doctrine of
solicitor-client privilege and placed it on a new plane. Privilege is no longer
regarded merely as a rule of evidence which acts as a shield to prevent
privileged materials from being tendered in evidence in a court room. The
courts, unwilling to so restrict the concept, have extended its application
well beyond those limits. However, while there is no question that the Canadian
courts have been moving towards a broader concept of solicitor-client
privilege, the concept has not been stretched far enough to save the
appellant's case. Although there has been a move away from treating
solicitor-client privilege as a rule of evidence that can only be asserted at
the time the privileged material is sought to be introduced as evidence, the
move from rigid temporal restrictions has not gone as far as the appellant
contends. The appellant's suggestion that privilege has come to be recognized
as a ""fundamental principle"", more properly characterized as a
""rule of property"", was not accepted. Without the evidentiary
connection, which the law now requires, the privilege cannot be invoked.

[Page 823]

The statutory disciplinary régime, described in this
case, does not derogate from the common law doctrine of solicitor and client
privilege, as presently conceived, but the appellant was seeking in this appeal
something well beyond the limits of the privilege, even as amplified in modern
cases.

In aid of his main submission, appellant argued
faintly that the Penitentiary Service Regulations and Com­missioner's Directive
should not be construed and applied so as to abrogate, abridge, or infringe any
of the rights or freedom recognized in the Canadian Bill of Rights by s. 1(b)
(the right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of
the law), 1(d) (freedom of speech) and 2(c)(ii) (the right of a person arrested
or detained to retain and instruct counsel without delay). This argument also
failed.

One could depart from the current concept of
privilege and approach the case on the broader basis that (i) the right to
communicate in confidence with one's legal adviser is a fundamental civil and
legal right, founded upon the unique relationship of solicitor and client, and
(ii) a person confined to prison retains all of his civil rights, other than
those expressly or impliedly taken from him by law. In that context, the Court
was faced with the interpretation of the Penitentiary Service Regulations and
Commissioner's Directive No. 219.

It was submitted there are three alternative
interpre­tations of the scope of Regulations 2.17 and 2.18 which may govern the
extent of the authority of the institutional head in dealing with an envelope
which appears to have originated from a solicitor, or to be addressed to a
solicitor, in circumstances where the institutional head has reason to believe
that the unrestricted and unexam­ined passage of mail to or from the particular
inmate in question represents a danger to the safety and security of the
institution. The third such interpretation was as follows: ""he may order
that the envelope be subject to opening and examination to the minimum extent
neces­sary to establish whether it is properly the subject of solicitor-client
privilege"". This alternative represents that interpretation of the scope
of the Regulations which permits to an inmate the maximum opportunity to com­municate
with his solicitor through the mails that is consistent with the requirement to
maintain the safety and security of the institution.

The ""minimum extent necessary to establish
whether it is properly the subject of solicitor-client privilege"" should
be interpreted in such manner that (i) the contents of an envelope may be
inspected for contraband;

[Page 824]

(ii) in limited circumstances, the communication may
be read to ensure that it, in fact, contains a confidential communication
between solicitor and client written for the purpose of seeking or giving legal
advice; (iii) the letter should only be read if there are reasonable and
probable grounds for believing the contrary, and then only to the extent
necessary to determine the bona fides of the communication; (iv) the authorized
penitentiary official who examines the envelope, upon ascertaining that the
envelope contains nothing in breach of security, is under a duty at law to
maintain the confidentiality of the communication.

Per Estey J.: As to the above item (iii) in the
catalogue of considerations in the interpretation of the expression
""minimum extent necessary to establish whether it is properly the subject
of solicitor-client privilege"", any procedure adopted with reference to
the scrutiny of letters passing from solicitor to client should, wherever
reasonably possible, recognize the solicitor-client privilege long established
in the law.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon,
Dickson, Beetz, Pratte and McIn­tyre JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—This case concerns the censorship of prisoners' mail
and the right of an inmate of a federal penitentiary to communicate in
confidence with his solicitor. The appellant, imprisoned at Millhaven
Institution, commenced an action in the Federal Court for a declaration that
""properly identified items of correspondence directed to and received from
his solicitor shall henceforth be regarded as privileged correspondence and
shall be forwarded to their respective destinations uno­pened"".

I 

Prison Disciplinary Regime

The penitentiary authorities rely upon the following statutes and
Regulations as authorizing restrictions upon the personal correspondence of
prison inmates. Section 660(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
provides that a sen­tence of imprisonment shall be served in accordance with
the enactments and rules that govern the institution to which the prisoner is
sentenced. Sec­tion 29(1) of the Penitentiary Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-6,
empowers the Governor in Council to make regulations for the custody,
treatment, training, employment, and discipline of inmates, and, gener­ally,
for carrying into effect the purposes and provisions of the Penitentiary Act.
Section 29(3) authorizes the Commissioner of Penitentiaries to make rules,
known as Commissioner's directives, for the custody, treatment, training,
employment, and discipline of inmates, and the good government of
penitentiaries.

Pursuant to the foregoing, Penitentiary Service Regulations
SOR/62-90, were passed, which pro-vide in part, as follows:

[Page 826]

Institutional Heads

1.12(1) The institutional head is responsible for the
direction of his staff, the organization, safety and security of his
institution and the correctional training of all inmates confined therein.

Visiting and Correspondence

2.17 The visiting and correspondence privileges that may, in
accordance with directives, be permit­ted to inmates shall be such as are, in
all the circumstances, calculated to assist in the refor­mation and
rehabilitation of the inmate.

Censorship

2.18 In so far as practicable the censorship of corre­spondence
shall be avoided and the privacy of visits shall be maintained, but nothing
herein shall be deemed to limit the authority of the Commissioner to direct or
the institutional head to order censorship of correspondence or supervision of
visiting to the extent considered necessary or desirable for the reformation
and rehabilitation of inmates or the security of the institution.

It will be observed then that the Regulations, the validity of
which are not challenged by the appellant, expressly recognize the authority of
the institutional head of a penitentiary to order censorship of inmate
correspondence to the extent con­sidered necessary or desirable for the
security of the institution. These Regulations are implemented by
Commissioner's Directive No. 219 (as amended following the date of issuance of
the statement of claim in these proceedings, but prior to the date of trial).
The following paragraphs are pertinent to the present inquiry:

Directive

5. a. Penitentiary staff shall promote and facilitate
correspondence between inmates and their families, friends, and other
individuals and agencies who can be expected to make a contribution to the
inmate's rehabilitation within the institution and to assist in his subsequent
and eventual return to the community.

c. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 14 every inmate
shall be permitted to correspond with any

[Page 827]

person, and shall be responsible for the contents of every
article of correspondence of which he is the author. There shall be no
restriction to the number of letters sent or received by inmates, unless it is
evident that there is mass production.

Paragraph 5 d. makes provision for inspection for contraband, in
these terms:

d. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 8, every item of
correspondence to or from an inmate may be opened by institutional authorities
for inspec­tion for contraband.

Censorship, dealt with in para. 7, is defined as any examination
(other than for the express purpose of searching for contraband) and includes
the read­ing, reproducing, extracting, or withdrawing of inmate correspondence.
Paragraph 7 b. makes the point that censorship in any form is to be avoided,
but reserves to the Commissioner of Penitentiaries and to the Institutional
Director the authority to censor for one of two purposes, the rehabilitation of
the inmate, or the security of the institution. Paragraph 7 b. reads:

Censorship of correspondence in any form shall be avoided,
but nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the authority of the Commissioner
to direct, or the Institutional Director to order, censorship of correspondence
in any form, to the extent considered necessary or desirable for the
rehabilitation of the inmate or the security of the institution. (PSR 2.18).
Any form of censorship shall be undertaken only with the approval of the
Institutional Director.

The Directive seeks to maintain the confidentiality of the
contents of correspondence. Paragraph 7 c. states that only authorized staff
shall be allowed to read inmate mail, when necessary, and further provides that
no comments, other than those required for official duties, shall be made to
other members of the staff on the contents of the correspondence.

Paragraph 8 of Directive 219 speaks of ""privileged
correspondence"", defined as ""properly iden­tified and addressed items
directed to and received from"" any of a lengthy list of persons including,
among others, members of the Senate, members of the House of Commons, members
of provincial

[Page 828]

legislatures, and provincial ombudsmen. Conspic­uous is the
absence of any reference to inmates' legal representatives. Privileged
correspondence is forwarded to the addressee unopened with the proviso that in
exceptional cases, where institutional staff suspect contraband in such
privileged correspondence, the Commissioner's approval shall be obtained before
it is opened. Paragraph 8 clearly countenances the maintenance of uncensored
channels of mail for complaints and grievances. But the restricted listing of
destinations assures that the channels through which grievances pass are
limited to internal procedures (Solicitor Gener­al, Commissioner of
Penitentiaries, Correctional Investigator) or political outlets (Members of Par­liament
and Senators). Lawyers are mentioned in paragraph 10 c. of Directive No. 219,
""Use of Telephone and Telegraph"", which reads:

c. In urgent cases where lawyers call their inmate clients,
and wish to communicate privately with them, the institutional authorities
shall ask the lawyer to leave his name and telephone number and, following
verification of the lawyer's identity, a call shall originate from the
institution.

For the purposes of trial, an agreed statement of facts was
filed. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the statement are in the following terms:

4. Pursuant to section 6 paragraph (b) [s. 7(b), as
amended,] of Directive No. 219, John Dowsett, Director of Millhaven Institution
has ordered that William (Billy) Solosky's mail be opened and read. This order
has been applied to mail originating from his solicitor David Cole.

5. William (Billy) Solosky's mail is being read because it
is John Dowsett's opinion that William (Billy) Solosky's conduct, activities
and attitude cause him to believe that attention should be paid to his incoming
and outgoing correspondence. Those letters which are deemed to be significant
with respect to the security of the institution are being brought to the
attention of John Dowsett.

Paragraph 5 of the statement of defence clarifies any obscurity
in para. 5 of the agreed statement of facts. The statement of defence reads
""The secu­rity of the Millhaven Institution has required that the
Plaintiff's mail be opened.""

[Page 829]

II 

Judicial History

Mr. Justice Addy, at trial, was of the view that solicitor and
client privilege, upon which the appellant founds his case, can only be claimed
document by document and that each document is privileged only to the extent it
meets the criteria which would support the privilege. Whether a letter does, in
fact, contain a privileged communication cannot be determined until it has been
opened and read. There is no logical nor legal justification for per­mitting
correspondence which appears to have emanated from, or to be addressed to, a
solicitor to enjoy any special aura of protection. Mr. Justice Addy relied upon
these propositions in dismissing the appellant's action, with costs. He
buttressed his conclusion by the argument that in this situa­tion it would be
too easy for a person to obtain envelopes and letterheads bearing the name and
title of a real or fictitious solicitor, and equally as easy for a prisoner to
camouflage the true identity of an addressee.

The appellant appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal. In that
Court, his counsel amended the pleadings to request a declaration "" ...
that hence-forth all properly identified items of solicitor-client
correspondence should be forwarded to their respective destinations
unopened"". The revised form of declaration differs little from that appear­ing
in the amended statement of claim. Both are defective, at least to this extent—it
is not every item of correspondence passing between solicitor and client to
which privilege attaches, for only those in which the client seeks the advice
of counsel in his professional capacity, or in which counsel gives advice, are
protected. That a privilege may not encompass all solicitor and client
communica­tions is clearly illustrated by the correspondence exhibited in the
present case. Some of the letters concerned the appellant's parole review.
Others merely contained criticism of the administration, information about
other inmates, and prison gossip. One letter enclosed a second letter with the
request that the second letter be forwarded to a named magazine for
publication.

[Page 830]

The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that a
declaration that all corre­spondence between the appellant and his solicitor be
declared privileged would extend considerably the ambit of the solicitor-client
privilege as it is generally known and understood. To grant the declaration
sought would be to give to the appel­lant an extension of the privilege
afforded to the ordinary citizen. As a second ground for rejecting the appeal,
the Court held that by issuing an order relating to correspondence not yet
written, the court would be granting relief on the basis of purely hypothetical
issues, and in futuro. Assum­ing jurisdiction, the case was not one where
jurisdiction should be asserted.

III 

Declaratory Relief

At the opening of the appeal in this Court, counsel for the
appellant moved to substitute, for the prayer for relief in the statement of
claim, a declaration that the order of the Director of Millhaven Institution
that the appellant's mail be opened and read ""insofar as it has been
applied to mail originating from his solicitor David Cole, and to mail written
by the Plaintiff to his solicitor David Cole, is not authorized by law"".
The amended form of prayer seems to have been conceived with a view to meeting
the point, taken by the Federal Court of Appeal, that the relief earlier sought
would relate to letters not yet written.

With great respect for the views expressed in the Federal Court
of Appeal, I do not think that the important issues raised in these proceedings
should be determined by the particular form of wording employed in the prayer
for relief, or on the basis that the question is hypothetical.

Declaratory relief is a remedy neither constrained by form nor
bounded by substantive content, which avails persons sharing a legal
relationship, in respect of which a 'real issue' concerning the relative
interests of each has been raised and falls to be determined.

The principles which guide the court in exercis­ing jurisdiction
to grant declarations have been

[Page 831]

stated time and again. In the early case of Russian Commercial
and Industrial Bank v. British Bank for Foreign Trade Ltd.[2],
in which parties to a contract sought assistance in construing it, the Court
affirmed that declarations can be granted where real, rather than fictitious or
academic, issues are raised. Lord Dunedin set out this test (at p. 448):

The question must be a real and not a theoretical question,
the person raising it must have a real interest to raise it, he must be able to
secure a proper contradic­tor, that is to say, someone presently existing who
has a true interest to oppose the declaration sought.

In Pyx Granite Co. Ltd. v. Ministry of Housing and Local
Government[3], (rev'd
[1960] A.C. 260, on other grounds), Lord Denning described the declaration in
these general terms (p. 571):

.. if a substantial question exists which one person has a
real interest to raise, and the other to oppose, then the court has a
discretion to resolve it by a declaration, which it will exercise if there is good
reason for so doing.

The jurisdiction of the court to grant declaratory relief was
again stated, in the broadest language, in Pharmaceutical Society of Great
Britain v. Dickson[4], a case
in which the applicant sought a declaration that a proposed motion of the phar­maceutical
society, if passed, would be ultra vires its objects and in unreasonable
restraint of trade. In the course of his judgment, Lord Upjohn stated, at p.
433:

A person whose freedom of action is challenged can always
come to the court to have his rights and position clarified, subject always, of
course, to the right of the court in exercise of its judicial discretion to
refuse relief in the circumstances of the case.

In the instant case, Mellstrom v. Garner[5],
was cited in the Federal Court of Appeal in support of

[Page 832]

the proposition that courts will not grant declara­tions
regarding the future. There, a chartered accountant and former partner of the
defendant sought a declaration as to the true construction of the agreement by
which the partnership had been dissolved. The plaintiff asked whether, having
regard to a clause in the agreement, he would be in breach were he to solicit
clients or business of the 'continuing partners'. Karminski L.J. held that
declarations concerning the future ought to be approached with considerable
reserve. Since nei­ther the plaintiff nor the defendants had broken the
provisions of the clause in question, nor sought to do so, there was no useful
purpose to be gained in granting the declaration. The application was
dismissed. That is a very different case from the present one.

As Hudson suggests in his article, ""Declaratory Judgments in
Theoretical Cases: The Reality of the Dispute"" (1977), 3 Dal.L.J. 706:

The declaratory action is discretionary and the two factors
which will influence the court in the exercise of its discretion are the
utility of the remedy, if granted, and whether, if it is granted, it will
settle the questions at issue between the parties.

The first factor is directed to the ""reality of the
dispute"". It is clear that a declaration will not normally be granted when
the dispute is over and has become academic, or where the dispute has yet to
arise and may not arise. As Hudson stresses, however, one must distinguish, on
the one hand, between a declaration that concerns ""future"" rights and
""hypothetical"" rights, and, on the other hand, a declaration that may
be ""immediately available"" when it determines the rights of the
parties at the time of the decision together with the necessary implications
and consequences of these rights, known as future rights. (p. 710)

Here there can be no doubt that there is a real and not a
hypothetical, dispute between the parties. The declaration sought is a direct
and present challenge to the censorship order of the Director of

[Page 833]

Millhaven Institute. That order, so long as it con­tinues, from
the past through the present and into the future, is in controversy. The fact
that a declaration today cannot cure past ills, or may affect future rights,
cannot of itself, deprive the remedy of its potential utility in resolving the
dispute over the Director's continuing order.

Once one accepts that the dispute is real and that the granting
of judgment is discretionary, then the only further issue is whether the
declara­tion is capable of having any practical effect in resolving the issues
in the case.

The determination of the right of prison inmates to correspond,
freely and in confidence with their solicitors, is of great practical
importance, although, admittedly, any such determination relates to
correspondence not yet written.

However poorly framed the prayer for relief may be, even as twice
amended, the present claim is clearly directed to the procedures for handling
prison mail and the invocation in relation thereto of solicitor-client
privilege. It is not directed to the characterization of specific and
individual items of correspondence. If the appellant is entitled to a
declaration, it is within this Court's discretion to settle the wording of the
declaration: see de Smith, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (3rd ed.
1973, p. 431). Further, s. 50 of the Supreme Court Act allows the Court to make
amendments neces­sary to a determination of the ""real issue"", without
application by the parties.

IV 

Solicitor-Client Privilege

As I have indicated, the main ground upon which the appellant
rests his case is solicitor-client privilege. The concept of privileged
communica­tions between a solicitor and his client has long been recognized as
fundamental to the due administration of justice. As Jackett C.J. aptly

[Page 834]

stated in Re Director of Investigation and Research and Shell
Canada Ltd.[6], at pp.
78-9:

... the protection, civil and criminal, afforded to the
individual by our law is dependent upon his having the aid and guidance of
those skilled in the law untrammelled by any apprehension that the full and
frank disclosure by him of all his facts and thoughts to his legal advisor
might somehow become available to third persons so as to be used against him.

The history of the privilege can be traced to the reign of Elizabeth
I (see Berd v. Lovelace[7] and
Dennis v. Codrington[8]). It
stemmed from respect for the 'oath and honour' of the lawyer, dutybound to
guard closely the secrets of his client, and was restricted in operation to an
exemption from testimonial compulsion. Thereafter, in stages, privi­lege was
extended to include communications exchanged during other litigation, those
made in contemplation of litigation, and finally, any consultation for legal
advice, whether Iitigious or not. The classic statement of the policy grounding
the privilege was given by Brougham L.C. in Greenough v. Gaskell[9],
at p. 620:

The foundation of this rule is not difficult to discover. It
is not (as has sometimes been said) on account of any particular importance
which the law attributes to the business of legal professors, or any particular
disposition to afford them protection (though certainly it may not be very easy
to discover why a like privilege has been refused to others, and especially to
medical advisers).

But it is out of regard to the interests of justice, which
cannot be upholden, and to the administration of justice, which cannot go on
without the aid of men skilled in jurisprudence, in the practice of the courts,
and in those matters affecting rights and obligations which form the subject of
all judicial proceedings. If the privilege did not exist at all, every one
would be thrown upon his own legal resources. Deprived of all professional
assistance, a man would not venture to consult any skilful person, or would
only dare to tell his counsellor half his case.

[Page 835]

The rationale was put this way by Jessel M.R. in Anderson v. Bank
of British Columbia[10], at p.
649:

The object and meaning of the rule is this: that as, by
reason of the complexity and difficulty of our law, litigation can only be
properly conducted by professional men, it is absolutely necessary that a man,
in order to prosecute his rights or to defend himself from an improper claim,
should have resource to the assistance of professional lawyers, and it being so
absolutely neces­sary, it is equally necessary, to use a vulgar phrase, that he
should be able to make a clean breast of it to the gentleman whom he consults
with a view to the prosecu­tion of his claim, or the substantiating of his
defence against the claim of others; that he should be able to place
unrestricted and unbounded confidence in the professional agent, and that the
communications he so makes to him should be kept secret, unless with his
consent (for it is his privilege, and not the privilege of the confidential
agent), that he should be enabled properly to conduct his litigation.

Wigmore [8 Wigmore, Evidence (McNaughton rev. 1961) para. 2292]
framed the modern principle of privilege for solicitor-client communications,
as follows:

Where legal advice of any kind is sought from a professional
legal adviser in his capacity as such, the com­munications relating to the
purpose made in confidence by the client are at his instance permanently
protected from disclosures by himself or by the legal adviser, except the
protection be waived.

There are exceptions to the privilege. The privilege does not
apply to communications in which legal advice is neither sought nor offered,
that is to say, where the lawyer is not contacted in his professional capacity.
Also, where the communica­tion is not intended to be confidential, privilege will
not attach, O'Shea v. Woods[11], at p.
289. More significantly, if a client seeks guidance from a lawyer in order to
facilitate the commission of a crime or a fraud, the communication will not be
privileged and it is immaterial whether the lawyer is an unwitting dupe or
knowing participant. The classic case is R. v. Cox and Railton[12],
in which Stephen J. had this to say (p. 167): ""A communication

[Page 836]

in furtherance of a criminal purpose does not 'come in the
ordinary scope of professional employment'.""

Recent case law has taken the traditional doctrine of privilege
and placed it on a new plane. Privilege is no longer regarded merely as a rule
of evidence which acts as a shield to prevent privileged materials from being
tendered in evidence in a court room. The courts, unwilling to so restrict the
concept, have extended its application well beyond those limits. See Re
Director of Investiga­tion and Research and Canada Safeway Ltd.[13];
Re Director of Investigation and Research and Shell Canada Ltd., supra; Re
Presswood et al. and International Chemalloy Corp.[14];
Re Borden and Elliot and The Queen[15],
(affirmed on other grounds[16]; Re BX
Development Inc. and The Queen[17]; Re B
and The Queen[18].

While there is no question that the Canadian courts have been
moving towards a broader con­cept of solicitor-client privilege, I do not think
the concept has been stretched far enough to save the appellant's case.
Although there has been a move away from treating solicitor-client privilege as
a rule of evidence that can only be asserted at the time the privileged
material is sought to be intro­duced as evidence, the move from rigid temporal
restrictions has not gone as far as the appellant contends. In the factum of
the appellant, it is suggested that the privilege has come to be recog­nized as
a ""fundamental principle"", more properly characterized as a ""rule
of property"". The cases cited in support of this proposition, however, all
involved search warrants that caught documents to which the privilege
unquestionably attached. In those cases, such as Re Borden & Elliot and The
Queen, supra, the search warrant led to the seizure of documents believed
""to afford evidence."" If privilege were to attach to the documents,
then such material could not afford evidence at trial and hence the evidentiary
connection remained.

[Page 837]

The judgments can be rationalized as merely shift­ing the time at
which the privilege can be asserted. As the comment by Kasting in (1978), 24
McGill L.J. 115, ""Recent Developments in the Law of Solicitor-Client
Privilege"" suggests, the shift away from the strict
rule-of-evidence-at-trial approach has taken place by logical extensions.
Chassé, in his annotation at (1977), 36 C.R.N.S. 349, The Solicitor-Client
Privilege and Search Warrants, asserts that the privilege is being looked upon
""as more akin to a rule of property rather than merely as a rule of
evidence"" (p. 350), but the privilege, in my view, is not yet near a rule
of property. That is what the privilege must become if the appellant is to
succeed.

There is no suggestion in the materials in the case at bar that
the authorities intend to employ the letters or extracts obtained therefrom as
evi­dence in any proceeding of any kind. Much as one might well wish to
analogize from the search warrant cases to the censorship order here impugned,
as a form of blanket search warrant upon appellant's mail, the order cannot be
charac­terized as being directed to obtaining or affording evidence in any
proceeding. Without the evidenti­ary connection, which the law now requires,
the appellant cannot invoke the privilege.

As Mr. Justice Addy notes, privilege can only be claimed document
by document, with each docu­ment being required to meet the criteria for the
privilege—(i) a communication between solicitor and client; (ii) which entails
the seeking or giving of legal advice; and (iii) which is intended to be
confidential by the parties. To make the decision as to whether the privilege
attaches, the letters must be read by the judge, which requires, at a minimum,
that the documents be under the jurisdiction of a court. Finally, the privilege
is aimed at improper use or disclosure, and not at merely opening.

The complication in this case flows from the unique position of
the inmate. His mail is opened

[Page 838]

and read, not with a view to its use in a proceed­ing, but by
reason of the exigencies of institutional security. All of this occurs within
prison walls and far from a court or quasi-judicial tribunal. It is difficult
to see how the privilege can be engaged, unless one wishes totally to transform
the privilege into a rule of property, bereft of an evidentiary basis.

In my view, the statutory disciplinary régime, which I have
earlier described, does not derogate from the common law doctrine of solicitor
and client privilege, as presently conceived, but the appellant is seeking in
this appeal something well beyond the limits of the privilege, even as
amplified in modern cases.

V

In aid of his main submission, resting upon privilege, counsel
for the appellant argued faintly that the Penitentiary Service Regulations and
Commissioner's Directive should not be construed and applied so as to abrogate,
abridge, or infringe any of the rights or freedoms recognized in the Canadian
Bill of Rights by s. 1(b) (the right of the individual to equality before the
law and the pro­tection of the law), 1(d) (freedom of speech) and 2(c)(ii) (the
right of a person arrested or detained to retain and instruct counsel without
delay). The authorities relied upon by counsel were, in the main, breathalyzer
cases dealing with the right of a motorist to communicate with his counsel in
private and without delay. These, and other cases cited, give little assistance
to the resolution of the issue now before the Court, due to the difference in
factual context and relevant considerations. The question in this case is
whether the appellant's right to retain and instruct counsel is incompatible
with the right of prison authorities to prevent threat to the security of the
institution. In my view, there is no such incompatibility provided the exercise
of authority is not greater than is neces­sary to support the security
interest. This, as I read it, is precisely the effect of para. 7b. of Directive
219.

[Page 839]

With respect to s. 1(b) of the Bill, it has been held by this
Court that equality before the law does not require ""that all federal
statutes must apply to all individuals in the same manner. Legislation dealing
with a particular class of people is valid if it is enacted for the purpose of
achieving a valid federal objective"": Martland J., giving the unanimous
reasons of this Court in Prata v. Min­ister of Manpower and Immigration[19],
at p. 382.

It is difficult to attack the validity of Peniten­tiary Service
Regulation 2.18 or Directive 219 with a freedom of speech argument, having
regard to the will of Parliament, as reflected in the Peni­tentiary Act and in
the Penitentiary Service Regu­lations, which preserves a limited right of
censorship by penitentiary authorities in the interests of security and, at the
same time, affords inmates a right to communicate freely through uncensored
channels with members of Parliament and provincial legislatures, and the many
persons listed in para. 8 of Directive 219.

VI

One may depart from the current concept of privilege and approach
the case on the broader basis that (i) the right to communicate in confi­dence
with one's legal adviser is a fundamental civil and legal right, founded upon
the unique relationship of solicitor and client, and (ii) a person confined to
prison retains all of his civil rights, other than those expressly or impliedly
taken from him by law.

In that context, the Court is faced with the interpretation of
the Penitentiary Service Regula­tions and Commissioner's Directive No. 219. Sec­tion
2.18 of the Regulations, as earlier noted, undoubtedly reserves the authority
of the institu­tional head to order censorship of correspondence to the extent
considered necessary or desirable for the security of the institution. As a
general rule, I do not think it is open to the courts to question the judgment
of the institutional head as to what may, or may not, be necessary in order to
maintain

[Page 840]

security within a penitentiary. On the other hand, it is to be
noted that Penitentiary Service Regula­tion 2.18 and Commissioner's Directive
No. 219 speak in general terms, in their reference to the reading of
correspondence and to other forms of censorship, without express mention of
solicitor-client correspondence. The right to privacy in solicitor-client
correspondence has not been expressly taken away by the language of the
Regulations and the Directive.

Most prisons are sufficiently remote that the mail constitutes
the prime means of communica­tion to an inmate's solicitor. Nothing is more
likely to have a ""chilling"" effect upon the frank and free exchange
and disclosure of confidences, which should characterize the relationship
between inmate and counsel, than knowledge that what has been written will be
read by some third person, and perhaps used against the inmate at a later date.
I do not understand counsel for the Crown to dispute the importance of these
considerations.

The result, as I see it, is that the Court is placed in the
position of having to balance the public interest in maintaining the safety and
security of a penal institution, its staff and its inmates, with the interest represented
by insulating the solicitor-client relationship. Even giving full recognition
to the right of an inmate to correspond freely with his legal adviser, and the
need for minimum deroga­tion therefrom, the scale must ultimately come down in
favour of the public interest. But the interference must be no greater than is
essential to the maintenance of security and the rehabilitation of the inmate.

The difficulty is in ensuring that the correspon­dence between
the inmate and his solicitor, wheth­er within the doctrine of solicitor-client
privilege or not, is not cloaking the passage of drugs, weapons, or escape
plans. There must be some mechanism for verification of authenticity. That
seems to be generally accepted. Yet, no one has so far suggested what third
party mechanism might be adopted, or by what authority the courts could impose
such a mechanism upon penitentiary authorities.

[Page 841]

Counsel for the Crown submits there are three alternative
interpretations of the scope of Regulations 2.17 and 2.18 which may govern the
extent of the authority of the institutional head in dealing with an envelope
which appears to have originated from a solicitor, or to be addressed to a
solicitor, in circumstances where the institutional head has reason to believe that
the unrestricted and unex­amined passage of mail to or from the particular
inmate in question represents a danger to the safety and security of the
institution:

(a) he may nonetheless permit the letter to be delivered
unopened and unexamined to the inmate;

(b) he may suspend the inmate's privilege to receive mail,
in respect of that letter, pursuant to sections 2.17 and 2.18 of the Penitentiary
Service Regulations.

(c) he may order that the envelope be subject to open­ing
and examination to the minimum extent neces­sary to establish whether it is
properly the subject of solicitor-client privilege.

Counsel contends that to interpret the Regulations as requiring
the first of these alternatives is to leave the institutional head without the
author­ity he requires to control the potential passage of contraband, or of
correspondence which may endanger the safety of the institution, under the
guise of confidential communications passing be­tween inmate and solicitor. I
agree. I would also reject the second as providing no solution. I agree that
the third alternative represents that interpre­tation of the scope of the
Regulations which per­mits to an inmate the maximum opportunity to communicate
with his solicitor through the mails that is consistent with the requirement to
maintain the safety and security of the institution.

In my view, the ""minimum extent necessary to establish
whether it is properly the subject of solicitor-client privilege"" should
be interpreted in such manner that (i) the contents of an envelope may be
inspected for contraband; (ii) in limited circumstances, the communication may
be read to ensure that it, in fact, contains a confidential communication
between solicitor and client written for the purpose of seeking or giving legal
advice; (iii) the letter should only be read if there are reasonable and
probable grounds for believing the contrary, and then only to the extent
necessary

[Page 842]

to determine the bona fides of the communication; (iv) the
authorized penitentiary official who exam­ines the envelope, upon ascertaining
that the envelope contains nothing in breach of security, is under a duty at
law to maintain the confidentiality of the communication. Paragraph 7c. of
Directive 219 underlines this point.

The appellant has failed to establish entitlement to a
declaration in any of the three forms he has advanced in these proceedings. The
appeal must be dismissed. The respondent is entitled to costs in this Court.

The following are the reasons delivered by

ESTEY J.—I have had the opportunity of read­ing the reasons for
judgment of my brother Dickson and I concur therein. I only wish to add to item
(iii) in his catalogue of considerations in the interpretation of the
expression ""minimum extent necessary to establish whether it is properly
the subject of solicitor-client privilege"". Item (iii) reads as follows:

(iii) the letter only should be read if there are reasonable
and probable grounds for believing the contrary, and then only to the extent
necessary to confirm the bona fides of the communication;

In my respectful view, any procedure adopted with reference to
the scrutiny of letters passing from solicitor to client should, wherever
reasonably possible, recognize the solicitor-client privilege long established
in the law. Any mechanics adopted for their examination should, subject only to
special circumstances indicating an overriding necessity for intervention by
the authorities, safeguard com­munications flowing under the protection of the
privilege so as to ensure that the privilege is left in a practical, workable
condition; for example, a covering letter from a solicitor forwarding a sealed
communication which the solicitor states to be a communication of legal advice
should ordinarily shield the enclosure from examination by the authorities. I
would dispose of the appeal as proposed by Dickson J.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Conspiracy to defraud the
public—Evidence—Unauthorized wiretap—Admissibility—Ex post facto
consent—Criminal Code , ss. 178.11(2) (a), 178.16(1) , 338(1) , 423(1) (d).

Evidence—Wiretap—Unauthorized
interception—Ex post facto consent—Criminal Code , ss. 178.11(2) (a), 178.16(1) ,
338(1) , 423(1) (d).

Appellant, with others, was charged with
conspiracy to defraud the public of money or valuable securities through a deceitful
distribution of the shares of Somed Mines Limited contrary to s. 423(1) (d)
and s. 338(1)  of the Criminal Code . The Crown tendered wiretap evidence
of private conversations between appellant and three other conspirators, B., S.
and L., who had originally been co-accused. The Crown relied on the express
consents of these three individuals to render the evidence admissible under s.
178.16(1)(b) of the Code. No attempt was made to prove that the
wiretaps were judicially authorized. The consents had been obtained only four
days prior to appellant’s trial and long after the interceptions had been made.
Subsequent to giving their consent, B., S. and L. pleaded guilty to the charge
of conspiracy to defraud. Each was fined and placed on probation. It was a term
of the probation order that they be available for appellant’s trial. All three
gave evidence but each testified under cross-examination that the fear of jail
was the governing factor in his decision to consent to the admission of the
wiretap evidence. The trial judge ruled that the consents rendered the evidence
admissible and appellant was convicted. His appeal to the Ontario Court of
Appeal was dismissed without written or recorded reasons. On further appeal,
appellant raised three points: first, that a consent under s. 178.16(1) (b)
must, to be effective, be obtained prior to the interception; second, that
evidence of interceptions not lawfully made and rendered admissible only by a
consent or consents under s. 178.16(1) (b) could be admissible only
against a consenter and third, that any consent must be

[Page 962]

freely given and not induced by any promise
or threat by the Crown.

Held (Laskin
C.J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz, Estey, Pratte and Mclntyre JJ.: While a
consent to admission in evidence under s. 178.11(2) (a) must precede the
interception, the consent under s. 178.16(1) (b) serves a different
purpose, namely, to permit the use in evidence of an interception unlawfully
made, i.e. without consent. In the case of s. 178.16(1) (b),
the consent therefore can be procured after the interception and up to the time
that the evidence is tendered.

The second point raised has not previously
been dealt with in this Court but was dealt with, and correctly so, in R. v.
Demeter (1975), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 321 (Ont. H.C.), which rejected the
proposition that the evidence could be received only against the consenter. As
there stated, the words of s. 178.16 are unambiguous. It is not appropriate to
introduce unnecessary words into the section which are not required to
clarify any ambiguity.

Finally, while the consent must be given
voluntarily, in the sense of not being the result of cærcion, and must be the
conscious act of the consenter, the consent will not be vitiated because the
motives for it may be selfish or even reprehensible. The requirements governing
the admission of confessions do not apply to the consents here, under s.
178.16(1) (b) where the consenter is consenting to the use of tapes or
other recordings which have been previously recorded and which he cannot
change. This is very different from agreeing to make a statement which could be
invented or to giving evidence in futuro which could be coloured in the
hope of reward or benefit.

Per Laskin
C.J., dissenting: A common law rule that has long prevailed in Canada is that evidence relevant to the
issues in a criminal matter is admissible even if illegally obtained. The issue
here, however, is the admissibility of evidence of illegally intercepted private
conversations in the face of a statutory code for the protection of privacy.
The majority of this Court have here held that s. 178.16(1)(b) of the Code
must be taken to embrace ex post facto consent where the
interception was originally unlawful, since s. 178.16(1) (a) removes the
exclusion where the interception was originally lawful, thus applying the rule
of construction that

[Page 963]

redundancy is not generally to be
countenanced when assessing parts of a statute or of a single section, and that
the various words must be given subject matter. On the assumption that the
words “lawfully made” in s. 178.16(1) (a) cover both judicial
authorization and prior consent to an interception (an assumption challenged in
the dissent in Goldman v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 976), it is
difficult to escape the conclusion that to give subject matter to s. 178.16(1) (b)
it must be taken to envisage ex post facto consents. Whether such a
consent makes the illegally intercepted evidence admissible against anyone
other than the consenter is more questionable. The case should nonetheless be
disposed of by ordering a new trial on another ground, namely, the inducement
to give the ex post facto consent by a promise of leniency which
excluded imprisonment and which was redeemed. Such a situation is
indistinguishable from the rule in confession cases even though here the
conversation is already at hand and is not itself induced. There is no
difference in principle between a promise of benefit to obtain an inculpatory
statement and a promise of benefit to make the fruits of an illegal
interception admissible by extracting a consent on the faith of the promise.
Indeed the situation here is more compelling for the rule which should be
applied because this is a case of saving one’s own skin at the expense of
another who is powerless, if a different rule is adopted, to maintain the
privacy of what he believed to be a private conversation.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing without
written or recorded reasons an appeal from a conviction, based on the evidence
of illegally intercepted conversations, for conspiracy to defraud through a
deceitful distribution of shares. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. dissenting.

[Page 964]

C.R. Thomson, Q.C., and R.G. MacKenzie,
for the appellant.

Douglas C. Hunt, for the respondent.

The following are the reasons delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—A common
law rule that has long prevailed in this country is that evidence which is
relevant to the issues in a criminal trial is admissible although obtained
illegally as by the commission of an offence. The rule has prevailed under the
majority decision of this Court in R. v. Wray[1] against the attempted exercise of
discretion by a trial judge to exclude evidence obtained by very disreputable
means. It has prevailed, under the majority decision of this Court in Hogan
v. The Queen[2], against
the imperatives of the Canadian Bill of Rights. What is in issue here is
the admissibility of evidence of illegally intercepted private conversations in
the face of a statutory code for the protection of privacy. The common law rule
is said to have been embedded in a statutory provision under which the
illegally obtained evidence becomes admissible against an accused upon the ex
post facto consent of others who are, moreover, moved to give their consent
by a Crown promise of benefit, that being not to be imprisoned upon a plea of
guilty to a conspiracy to defraud with which they were charged along with the
accused. In the present case, the promise was kept when these co-accused, dealt
with separately, were fined and put on probation, one of the terms being that
they testify at accused’s trial. This they did.

It is unfortunate that the conviction of the
accused after trial by jury, based on the evidence of the illegally intercepted
conversations, was affirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal without written or
recorded reasons. The present case is the first to reach this Court on the
facts which I have recited. It raises for me some fundamental questions
referable to the construction and application of the statutory language in
which privacy is dealt with under the Criminal Code , and referable also
to the need for clearer or more precise drafting of provisions which now
appear,

[Page 965]

under the reasons of Mclntyre J. endorsed by the
other members of the Court, to have given carte blanche to the
prosecution not only to ignore illegality in the interception of private
conversations (since the likelihood of prosecution is remote), but also to cure
inadmissibility by promises of benefit to parties to the conversations if they
would consent to their use against an accused with whom the conversations were
carried on.

The provisions of the Criminal Code  respecting
protection of privacy start with s. 178.1  and are headed “Invasion of Privacy:
Interception of Communications”. For present purposes I need only refer to the
relevant provisions of ss. 178.11  and 178.16  as they were at the material time.
They are as follows:

178.11 (1) Every one who, by means of
electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device, wilfully intercepts a
private communication is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to
imprisonment for five years.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to

(a) a person who has the consent to
intercept, express or implied, of the originator of the private communication
or of the person intended by the originator thereof to receive it;

(b) a person who intercepts a
private communication in accordance with an authorization or any person who in
good faith aids in any way a person whom he has reasonable and probable grounds
to believe is acting with any such authorization;

…

178.16 (1) A private communication that has
been intercepted and evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of
information acquired by interception of a private communication are both inadmissible
as evidence against the originator thereof or the person intended by the
originator thereof to receive it unless

(a) the interception was lawfully
made; or

(b) the originator of the private
communication or the person intended by the originator thereof to receive it
has expressly consented to the admission thereof.

It is the fact that no previous consent, as is
stipulated by s. 178.11(2) (a), was obtained for the interceptions in
this case nor was any evidence adduced to show that judicial authorization was

[Page 966]

previously sought as envisaged by s. 178.11(2) (b).
The submission of the Crown, accepted below and by Mclntyre J., is that the
exclusion declared by the opening words of s. 178.16(1)  is removed in this case
under s. 178.16(1) (b) which must be taken to embrace ex post facto consent
where the interception was originally unlawful since s. 178.16(1) (a)
removes the exclusion where the interception was originally lawful. The rule of
construction that is applied is that redundancy is not generally to be
countenanced when assessing parts of a statute or of a single section, and the
various words must be given subject matter.

On the assumption that the words “lawfully made”
in s. 178.16(1) (a) cover both judicial authorization and prior consent to
an interception (an assumption which I challenge in my reasons in Goldman v.
The Queen[3], issued
concurrently with those in this case) it is difficult to escape the conclusion
that to give subject matter to s. 178.16(1) (b) it must be taken to
envisage ex post facto consents. It is to me more questionable, however,
whether such a consent makes the evidence of the illegally intercepted
conversation admissible against anyone other than the person consenting. It is
one thing to immunize a person from liability under s. 178.11(2) (a) where he
has the prior consent to intercept either from the originator or intended
recipient of the communication or conversation. It is a different thing, a more
serious departure from the policy to give protection to private communications,
to permit A. to make an illegally intercepted communication between him and B.
admissible against the latter by A.’s ex post facto consent.

Nonetheless, I would dispose of this case by
ordering a new trial on another ground, namely, the inducement to give ex
post facto consent by a promise of leniency which excluded imprisonment and
which was redeemed. I cannot distinguish such a situation from the rule in
confession cases even though here the intercepted conversation is

[Page 967]

already at hand and is not itself induced by a
previous promise of benefit or threat or advantage. I do not think there is any
difference in principle between a promise of benefit to obtain an inculpatory
statement and a promise of benefit to make the fruits of an illegal
interception admissible by extracting a consent on the faith of the promise.
The situation here is more compelling for the rule I would apply because this
is not a case of inculpating oneself but of saving one’s own skin at the
expense of another who is powerless, if a different rule is adopted, to insist
on any right to maintain the privacy of what he believed to be a private
conversation.

In my opinion, the issue of voluntariness of a
consent to an interception or to the admissibility in evidence of an intercepted
communication bears a relation to the issue of voluntariness as it arises in
confession cases. It is true that in the statements of the rationale of
voluntariness in the confession cases emphasis was laid on the trustworthiness
of the inculpatory statement in the light of the inducement to make it: see Boudreau
v. The King[4], at p.
269. The likelihood of falsity as the ground of exclusion is also seen in this
Court’s judgment in Attorney General for Quebec v. Begin[5]. However, the law has advanced beyond this
(although trustworthiness remains a factor), as is evident from the Chadbourn
revision of 1970 of 3 Wigmore on Evidence (1970), s. 822, at pp.
329-336. The original edition of Wigmore had emphasized trustworthiness alone
and it found favour in Canadian courts, but even there other factors were
appreciated such as (to use the words of Rand J. In re Validity of
Section 92(4) of The Vehicles Act 1957 (Sask.)[6], at p. 619, referring to Wigmore and to the analogous rule against
self-incrimination) “inevitable abuse and the concomitant moral deterioration
in methods of obtaining evidence and in the general administration of justice
in criminal matters”. See also Dixon C.J. in

[Page 968]

McDermott v. The
King[7], at p.
513. Certainly, if trustworthiness was alone relevant, then in the present case
there could be no doubt that the confession rule would be irrelevant on the
issue of voluntariness when the interception had been made (albeit illegally)
before consent to admission in evidence was obtained by the promise of benefit.

The advance of other rationales than truth or
falsity in the American cases, e.g. the control of illegal police
methods in the inducement of a confession, owes much to the due process clause
of the United States constitution: see Rogers v. Richmond[8], at p. 540; Jackson v. Denno[9], at p. 385. They suggest a similar
adaptation of the due process clause of the Canadian Bill of Rights, but
I do not see the need here to rest entirely on this because I hold the view
that where, as here, we are dealing with statutory procedures, unfairness or
impropriety in effecting an interception or in making an intercepted
communication admissible in evidence is as relevant a rationale as reliability
of the evidence.

I do not regard it as necessary that a person
who acts at the behest of the public or prosecution, on a promise of benefit to
him, be shown to be one in authority when he originates a private communication
to be intercepted by the police or consents ex post facto to the
admission in evidence of an illegally intercepted communication with the
accused. In this respect, I would not apply the confession rules to the present
case. What does concern me is that the accused is made an innocent pawn in the
loss of his expectation of privacy. I am of the opinion that the statutory
policy of protection of privacy demands, in view of the vulnerability of an
accused’s position at the hands of a confederate, pressed into police service,
that a strict view be taken of the voluntary character of

[Page 969]

the confederate’s conduct in destroying an
accused’s expectation of privacy.

There are American cases which take a different
view, namely, that a mere promise of leniency is not enough to vitiate consent
to an interception unless there has been undue pressure to procure it: see United
States v. Silva[10], at p.
146; United States v. Baker[11],
at p. 503; United States v. Osser[12], at p. 730. These were cases relating to
prior consent to arrange for an interception and not like the situation here
which concerns ex post facto consent. However, the principle, if
adopted, is as applicable to the one situation as to the other. Whether on the
facts here there can be said to have been overbearing pressure is doubtful,
especially in light of the fact that the consentors gave evidence at the trial.
Nonetheless, I adhere to the stricter view which would exclude the evidence of
the intercepted communication because of the initiative of the police in
obtaining the consents, especially at a time when the consentors were as much
under charge as the accused.

I agree with what was said by Hamilton J. of the
Manitoba Queen’s Bench in R. v. Dass[13] that the onus is on the Crown to prove
that the consent was voluntary and that, as Duff C.J.C. indicated in Walker v. The King[14], this
means that there is an absence of fear of prejudice or hope of advantage held
out by persons in authority. This was not met in the present case. The Dass case
went to the Manitoba Court of Appeal on another point: see [1979] 4 W.W.R. 97
and leave to appeal here was refused on December 13, 1979.

I would, accordingly, allow the appeal, set
aside the conviction and order a new trial.

[Page 970]

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon,
Dickson, Beetz, Estey, Pratte and Mclntyre JJ. was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—The appellant, along with eight
other persons, was charged with conspiracy to defraud the public of money or
valuable securities through a deceitful distribution of the shares of Somed
Mines Limited contrary to s. 423(1) (d) and s. 338(1)  of the Criminal
Code . At his trial before judge and jury, the Crown tendered wiretap
evidence of private conversations between the appellant and three other
conspirators who had originally been co-accused, namely, Bader, Smith and
Lindzon. The Crown relied on the express consents of these three individuals to
render this evidence admissible under s. 178.16(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code . No attempt was made to prove that the wiretaps were judicially
authorized.

The consents in question had been obtained from
Smith, Bader and Lindzon on March 4 and 5, 1976, only four days before the
commencement of the appellant’s trial on March 8 and long after the
interceptions had been made. The three co-accused attended at R.C.M.P.
Headquarters in Toronto in
order to hear tape recordings of interceptions of telephone conversations made
from July to September of 1974. Before hearing the tapes, each man, acting upon
counsel’s advice, signed a consent to the use in evidence of any intercepted
conversation in which he had participated. Prior to this date, they had been
supplied with transcripts of the conversations. On March 5, the three attended
in Provincial Court and each
pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiring to defraud the public. Each was
fined and placed on probation. It was a term of the probation order that they
be available to testify at the appellant’s trial. They did appear at the trial
and in giving evidence each reaffirmed his consent under oath in his evidence
on the voir dire to determine the admissibility of the interceptions.
Each testified under cross-examination that the fear of going to jail was the
governing factor in his decision to consent to the admission of the wiretap
evidence, and each agreed that he would not have so consented in the absence of
an understanding with

[Page 971]

counsel for the Crown that imprisonment would
not be sought upon his conviction.

The trial judge ruled that the consents rendered
the wiretap evidence admissible and the appellant was convicted. An appeal to
the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed without written or recorded reasons.
Both parties agreed that if the wiretap evidence had not been admitted, it
would be impossible to say with any degree of certainty whether a jury would
have convicted or acquitted the appellant. This agreement was reached to suggest
that the proper relief in the event of a successful appeal would be a new
trial.

In the hearing before us the appellant raised
three points. He contended that a consent under s. 178.16(1) (b) must, in
order to be effective, be obtained prior to the interception; that evidence of
interceptions not lawfully made and rendered admissible only by a consent or
consents under s. 178.16(1) (b) could be admissible against a consenter
only and not other parties; that any consent must be freely given and not induced
by any promise or threat by the Crown.

I now turn to the first point taken by the
appellant that the consent referred to in s. 178.16(1) (b) must be
obtained by the Crown before the interception is made. Section 178.11 of
the Code deals with the electronic interception of private
communications and the parts relevant to this point are set out hereunder:

178.11 (1) Every one who, by means of
electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device, wilfully intercepts a
private communication is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to
imprisonment for five years.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to

(a) a person who has the consent to
intercept, express or implied, of the originator of the private communication
or of the person intended by the originator thereof to receive it;

(b) a person who intercepts a
private communication in accordance with an authorization or any person

[Page 972]

who in good faith aids in any way a person
whom he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe is acting with any such
authorization;

Section 178.16, as it then read, deals with
the admissibility of evidence obtained by electronic interception of private
communications and the relevant parts are set out hereunder:

178.16 (1) A private communication that has
been intercepted and evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of
information acquired by interception of a private communication are both
inadmissible as evidence against the originator thereof or the person intended
by the originator thereof to receive it unless

(a) the interception was lawfully
made; or

(b) the originator of the lawful
communication or the person intended by the originator thereof to receive it
has expressly consented to the admission thereof.

In my opinion, this argument is based upon a failure
to distinguish between the consent to intercept referred to in s. 178.11(2) (a)
and the consent to admit in evidence under s. 178.16(1) (b). The consent
to intercept under s. 178.11(2) (a), if it is to be effective to render
an interception lawful, must plainly precede the interception. When it has been
given and the interception completed, it has performed its role. No further
consent is needed for the admission in evidence because the interception has
been lawfully made: see judgment in Goldman v. The Queen[15] delivered concurrently herewith. The
consent to admission in evidence under s. 178.16(1) (b) serves a
fundamentally different purpose. It is to permit the use in evidence of an
interception made without authorization or consent and hence unlawfully made
and otherwise inadmissible. It can be procured at any time after the
interception and up to the time the evidence is tendered at trial.

The second point taken by the appellant raised
the following questions. Assuming a valid consent to the introduction of
evidence by the originator of the communication or by the intended receiver,
against whom may the evidence be received? In the case at bar, we have three
persons who had been either originators or recipients of private

[Page 973]

communications which were relevant to the issues
in the case involving themselves and the appellant. In return for their
cooperation with the Crown, which included the giving of consents to the
admission of the evidence, they received lenient treatment upon their pleas of
guilty and were thus removed from the proceedings. The appellant argued that
ordinary justice and sound legal principle required that evidence made
admissible by consent in this manner should be admitted only against the
consenter or consenters and not against other parties to the private
communications. In the circumstances of this case, acceptance of this
proposition would exclude the evidence entirely. To permit the evidence to be
introduced against a non‑consenter, it was said, would make the
admissibility of evidence against an accused dependent not upon the application
of rules of law but upon the whim of a co-accused or, as here, a person no
longer a party to the proceedings. To admit evidence against one party upon the
consent of another in this manner would deprive an accused of a protection the
law has given him against the use of evidence at his trial obtained by unlawful
interception.

This question has not been dealt with in this
Court and there is little reported authority upon the point. We were referred
to the case of R. v. Demeter[16]
at p. 330, where Grant J. dealt with a similar submission and rejected the
argument that the evidence could be received only against the consenter. In my
opinion, he dealt with the matter correctly. He pointed out that the words of
s. 178.16 are unambiguous and it is not necessary, in order to give them
effect, to read the section as if it included the word “respectively”
after “originator thereof” or “the person intended to receive it” so that the
section would read:

178.16 (1) A private communication that has
been intercepted and evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of
information acquired by interception of a private communication are both
inadmissible as evidence against the originator thereof or the person intended
by the originator thereof, respectively, to receive it unless

[Page 974]

(a)…

(b) the originator of the private
communication or the person intended by the originator thereof, respectively,
to receive if has expressly consented to the admission thereof.

(The emphasis is my own.)

To do so would be to introduce unnecessary words
into the section which are not required to clarify any ambiguity. It may
be observed that the approach adopted by Grant J. in the Demeter case is
the one largely adopted in American jurisdictions, admittedly upon a different
statutory and constitutional base: see United States of America v. James
Ryan, United States of America v. Adrian Wilson, United States of
America v. Bernard Zeldin[17], United
States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit; United States of America v. John
Elbert Ransom et al.[18],
United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit; United States Court of
America v. Frank John Bonanno[19],
United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, and generally The Law of
Electronic Surveillance, James G. Carr, with specific reference to p. 90,
para. 3.05.

Finally, the appellant argued that any consent
of the nature involved here must be a bona fide and freely given consent
and not induced by promised benefits or compelled by threats. It was said that
the consent should meet the same test of admissibility as that which applies to
a statement made by an accused person to police officers after arrest. I cannot
accept this conclusion. The consent must, in my opinion, be given voluntarily in
the sense that it may not be the result of coercion. It must be the conscious
act of the consenter freely performed for reasons of his own which appear to
him to be sufficient. The consent will not be vitiated, however, because the
motives for it may be selfish or even reprehensible. I am not persuaded by the
argument that the requirements governing the admission of confessions by
accused persons should apply where the validity of a consent under s.
178.16(1) (b) of the Criminal Code  is examined. In such a case,
very different considerations apply.

[Page 975]

The consenter is consenting to the use in
evidence of tapes or other recordings which have been previously recorded and
which he cannot change. He is not agreeing to make a statement which he could
invent nor to give evidence in futuro which he could colour in the hope
of reward or benefit. The nature of the evidence which will be admitted as a
result of his consent is already fixed and determined and cannot be affected by
the circumstances of the consent: see Goldman v. The Queen, supra. I
would dismiss the appeal.

I observe, in conclusion, that I feel compelled
to reach this result by the plain terms of the statute. I have sympathy for the
contention that Parliament, in enacting provisions for the protection of a
right to privacy, should not be taken to have intended this result, allowing,
as it does, the unilateral destruction of any such right by one party to a
protected conversation. The parliamentary intention, however, must be found in
the words Parliament employed. In my view, they are intractable.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law — Appellants convicted of conspiring to traffic
in heroin — Subsequent declarations by prin­cipal Crown witness asserting his
trial evidence untrue — Refusal of Court of Appeal to admit this new evidence —
No error in law on part of Court of Appeal — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, s. 610(1)(d).

This was an appeal against the refusal of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal to admit fresh evidence in the appeal of the
appellants Palmer against their convic­tion in the Supreme Court of British
Columbia before Macfarlane J. sitting without a jury upon an indictment
charging a conspiracy to traffic in heroin. A separate appeal relying on the
same grounds was taken by Thomas Maxwell Duncan, John Albert Smith and Robert
Porter who were named conspirators in the same indictment with the Palmers and
who were convicted at the same trial. (See [1980] 1 S.C.R. 783.)

One of the important witnesses called for the Crown,
both at the preliminary hearing and at the trial, was one Ford, an admitted
heroin trafficker and a disreputable character with a criminal record. His
evidence was accepted by the trial judge and clearly played a signifi­cant part
in the result. After the trial, Ford, in a series of declarations, asserted
that his trial evidence was untrue, that it had been fabricated in its
entirety, and that he had been influenced by threats and inducements, including
the promise of payments of money, by the police. When this material came into
the hands of the legal advisers of the appellants, they applied in the Court of
Appeal, under s. 610(1) (d) of the Criminal Code , to adduce this new
evidence in affidavit form. The application was dismissed by the Court of
Appeal and the appeals of all the appellants, which raised other grounds of
appeal as well, were dismissed. The present appeal was taken by leave of this
Court upon two points as follows:

[Page 760]

1. Did the Court of Appeal of British Columbia err in
refusing to allow the appellants to adduce fresh evi­dence before it based on
the affidavits and statements of the principal Crown witness Frederick Thomas
Ford who received $25,000 from the police ""in payment for services""
about a week after the trial judg­ment herein?

2. Did the trial judge err in rejecting the
testimony of the appellant Douglas Garnet Palmer with respect to three
incidents concerning the observed movements of Frederick Thomas Ford on July
18, 1972, November 8, 1972 and January 23, 1973, when the said Ford gave no
evidence on those incidents and the appellant Palmer was not cross-examined
thereon, and did the Court of Appeal err in not quashing the convictions
accordingly?

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

Parliament has given the Court of Appeal a broad
discretion in s. 610(1) (d). The overriding consideration must be in the words
of the enactment ""the interests of justice"" and it would not serve
the interests of justice to permit any witness by simply repudiating or
changing his trial evidence to reopen trials at will to the general detriment
of the administration of justice. Applications of this nature have been
frequent and courts of appeal in various provinces have pronounced upon them.
The following principles have emerged: (1) The evidence should generally not be
admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided
that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case
as in civil cases. (2) The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears
upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial, (3) The evidence
must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief. (4) It
must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence
adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result. The approach thus
taken follows that of this Court in McMartin v. The Queen, [1964] S.C.R.
484.

In the present case it was evident that the Court of
Appeal applied the test of credibility and found the evidence tendered as to
the validity of Ford's trial evidence to be wholly unworthy of belief. It
therefore refused the motion and in so doing made no error in law which would
warrant interference by this Court. Also, although it might not be necessary to
do so in view of this conclusion, the view was expressed that the Court of
Appeal was fully justified in reaching the conclusion it

[Page 761]

did upon a consideration of all the evidence adduced
on the motion before it and the evidence appearing in the trial transcripts.

With respect to the matter of affording protection
to witnesses, in cases where the courts are, after careful examination,
satisfied that only reasonable and neces­sary protection has been provided and
that no prejudice or miscarriage of justice has resulted in consequence, they
should not draw unfavourable inferences against the Crown, by reason only of
this expenditure of public funds.

As to the second point raised in the appeal, the
trial judge, as stated by McFarlane J.A. for the Court below, gave a careful
explanation for his acceptance of the story of Ford and rejecting that of
Douglas Palmer. The finding against the credibility of Palmer was made upon
much more than the evidence of the three events in question. It was based upon
a consideration of the whole of the evidence including the full examination and
cross-examination of Palmer.

R. v. Stewart (1972), 8 C.C.C. (2d) 137; R.
v. Foster (1977), 8 A.R. l; R. v. McDonald, [1970] 3 C.C.C. 426;
R. v. Demeter (1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 417; McMartin v. The
Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 484, referred to.

APPEAL against the refusal of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia to admit fresh evi­dence in the appeal of the appellants Palmer
against their conviction in the Supreme Court of British Columbia before
Macfarlane J. sitting without a jury upon an indictment charging a conspiracy
to traffic in heroin. Appeal dismissed.

Harry Walsh, Q. C., for the appellants.

Mark M. de Weerdt, Q.C., for the respondent. The judgment
of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—This is an appeal against the refusal of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal to admit fresh evidence in the appeal of the appel­lants
Palmer against their conviction in the Supreme Court of British Columbia before
Mac­farlane J. sitting without a jury upon an indictment charging a conspiracy
to traffic in heroin. A separate appeal relying on the same grounds was taken
by Thomas Maxwell Duncan, John Albert

[Page 762]

Smith and Robert Porter who were named con­spirators in the same
indictment with the Palmers and who were convicted at the same trial. Although
the appeals were heard together, these reasons will deal with the Palmers only.

The indictment dated November 24th, 1975, charged in count 1 a
conspiracy to traffic in heroin between the 1st day of February 1969 and the
30th day of April 1975. This count is the only one in issue on this appeal. A
preliminary hearing commenced in February of 1975, after a postponement from
September 1974, because the witness Ford, of whom much more will be said, had
then absented himself. The trial, which lasted several weeks, commenced on
January 12, 1976. The appellants were found guilty on March 23, 1976.

One of the important witnesses called for the Crown, both at the
preliminary hearing and at the trial, was Frederick Ford, referred to above, an
admitted heroin trafficker and a disreputable character with a criminal record.
His evidence was accepted by the trial judge and clearly played a significant
part in the result. After the trial, Ford, in a series of declarations,
asserted that his trial evidence was untrue, that it had been fabricated in its
entirety, and that he had been influenced by threats and inducements, including
the promise of payments of money, by the police. When this material came into
the hands of the legal advisers of the appellants, they applied in the Court of
Appeal to adduce this new evidence in affidavit form. The application was
dismissed by the Court of Appeal and the appeals of all the appellants, which
raised other grounds of appeal as well, were dismissed. This appeal is taken by
leave of this Court upon two points which are set out hereunder:

1. Did the Court of Appeal of British Columbia err in
refusing to allow the appellants to adduce fresh evidence before it based on
the affidavits and state­ments of the principal Crown witness Frederick Thomas
Ford who received $25,000.00 from the police ""in payment for
services"" about a week after the trial judgment herein?

[Page 763]

2. Did the trial Judge err in rejecting the testimony of the
appellant Douglas Garnet Palmer with respect to three incidents concerning the
observed move­ments of Frederick Thomas Ford on July 18, 1972, November 8, 1972
and January 23, 1973 when the said Ford gave no evidence on those incidents and
the appellant Palmer was not cross-examined there—on, and did the Court of
Appeal err in not quashing the convictions accordingly?

The principal point argued in this Court was point 1. It will, of
course, be seen at once that this point raises no question as to the conduct of
the trial and attacks no determination made by the trial judge. The sole issue
raised relates to the disposition made by the Court of Appeal.

Ford gave evidence both at the preliminary hearing and at the
trial that in June of 1971 he had approached Douglas Palmer, whom he had known
for some fifteen years, and asked for a job in the drug business. After some
delay, he was introduced into the business and he worked with the Palmers in
the trafficking of heroin during the period covered by the indictment. He said
that on numerous occasions he had received bulk heroin from Douglas Palmer. It
was then his task, with the assistance of others, to put the heroin into
gelatin capsules and bundles of the capsules, into glass containers and to bury
the containers at locations, particulars of which he would give to Palmer. As
the heroin was sold, Palmer, or others under his direction, were thus enabled
to direct purchasers to the hidden heroin to complete the sales. During this
period, Ford was paid for his services by Douglas Palmer.

Ford said that during the summer of 1972 he had employed his
nephew to plant out caches of heroin for him. The nephew was caught by the
police and Ford was able, by giving the police information which led to the
arrest of one of his associates named DeRuiter, to procure the release of his
nephew and have the prosecution dropped. It seems that it was this contact with
the police which led Ford at or about that time to furnish information
concerning the activities of the Palmers to the police.

Ford said that he received a call from Douglas Palmer on January
20, 1973, in which he was

[Page 764]

instructed to get together all the heroin in his possession and
to meet another member of the organization for the purpose of getting rid of
the heroin all at once so a purchase of newer stock could be made. In
compliance with these instruc­tions, the heroin was disposed of at night by
throwing it from a moving car in a garbage bag. When this was completed, Ford
reported to Palmer who told him that he was fired. He gave evidence at trial of
the conversation which passed between them on this occasion in these words:

A. Well, I said ""What do you mean?"" He said,
""Well, I found out that you are the one that set up De Ruiter for the
bust"" he said, ""So you are fired."" And I just said, you know,
""I don't know what you are talking about."" And then I said,
""Well, what about my money you owe me?"" and he said, ""You are
not getting any money."" And I said, ""Well, you know, you owe me the
money"" and he said, ""Tough"", you know.

Q. How much money did he owe you at that time? A. Oh, 12,500
or something.

Q. Did you ever receive that from him? A. No.

Q. Was there any further conversation on that occa­sion when
he terminated your services?

A. Well, other than ""If I ever find out for sure it was
you ..."", you know, that's all. Other than that. I am lucky to be alive,
that's all.

Q. I am sorry, would you speak up?

A. He said that I am lucky to be alive. If he finds out for
sure that it's me that set up DeRuiter, I am in big trouble.

Ford continued trafficking independently until on January 6,
1975, he was shot in the street near his home. A police officer, one Steer, a
member of the Vancouver City Police and not connected with the investigation of
this case, attended at the scene of the shooting and had a conversation with
Ford just before he was taken to hospital. Steer asked ""Who shot
you?"". Ford replied ""Pick up Doug Palmer"". The officer then said
""Did Palmer shoot you?"". Ford said ""Just pick up Doug
Palmer"". Ford was taken to hospital and while still in the emergency
section had another conversation with a

[Page 765]

Vancouver police officer named Caros. The ver­sion given by the
police officer follows:

CAROS: ""Who shot you?"" 

FORD: ""I don't know.""

CAROS: ""You mentioned a man at the scene of the
shooting.""

FORD: ""Yes, Doug Palmer. He didn't do it, he's too
chicken. He hired someone.""

CAROS: ""Why did he do it?""

FORD: ""Guess he didn't like me."" 

CAROS: ""How many men involved?"" 

FORD: ""One.""

CAROS: ""Did he have two guns?"" 

FORD: ""Yes.""

CAROS: ""Did you see a car?""

FORD: ""No.""

CARDS: ""What did he look like?""

FORD: ""He had a dark mask, a toque and a dark coat
on.""

CARDS: ""Did you know him?""

FORD: ""No.""

I consider it significant that moments after the shooting Ford
identified Palmer as either his assailant or the instigator of the attack. The
cir­cumstances of the shooting, the earlier dismissal from the organization
coupled with the disagreement about money, furnish a motive for Ford's later
conduct.

After Ford's dismissal by Palmer, he agreed to testify for the
Crown. The precise date of such agreement is unclear. He gave evidence at the
preliminary hearing and at the trial, and on each occasion his evidence was
essentially the same. He. was cross-examined closely on both occasions. He
admitted that in return for his agreement to give evidence against Douglas
Palmer, and for the actual giving of the evidence, he had been prom­ised
immunity from prosecution on certain charges which were outstanding against him
and protec­tion for himself and his family. To that end he said he had been
paid an allowance of $1,200 per month up to the time of the trial. He said the

[Page 766]

police had agreed as well to provide for relocation and
maintenance expenses after the trial for himself and his family until they were
reestablished in life and secure from danger.

The defence was a flat denial by Palmer of any involvement with
drugs and with Ford. It was asserted that Ford's evidence was completely
fabricated.

At the outset of the appeal, in which various other grounds were
raised, the appellants moved under s. 610(1) (d) of the Criminal Code  to
have the Court receive evidence in the form of declara­tions from Douglas
Palmer, Donald Palmer, Edith Twaddell and Thomas Ford. Section 610(1)(d) of the
Criminal Code is set out hereunder:

610. (1) For the purposes of an appeal under this Part the
court of appeal may, where it considers it in the interests of justice,

(d) receive the evidence, if tendered, of any witness,
including the appellant, who is a competent but not compellable witness;

On this motion, the Court of Appeal had before it the various
declarations referred to above and in addition affidavits in reply from Crown
counsel and several police officers including affidavits from officers of the
Vancouver Police Force con­cerning the words spoken by Ford after the shoot­ing
incident. Upon a consideration of this material, the Court refused the motion
and disposed of the other grounds raised and dismissed the appeal.

The argument in this Court centered on the declarations made by
Ford and the Crown affida­vits in reply. The declaration of Edith Twaddell is
of no significance and requires no further mention. The other declarations
produced in support of the motion are largely explanatory of the events lead­ing
to the production of Ford's documents. Ford made four declarations dated,
respectively, April 20, 1976, May 21, 1976, October 7, 1976, and October 13,
1976. In his first declaration, he said that he received $25,000 in cash from
the R.C.M.P. in April 1976 for services rendered which he described as
testifying in the Palmer drug conspiracy trial. He exhibited a receipt to the

[Page 767]

declaration prepared by the R.C.M.P. which he had signed. It was
on a printed form acknowledg­ing the receipt of $25,000 from R.C.M.P. Inspec­tor
Eyman. The printed words ""Payment in full for services rendered"" had
been struck out and the words ""Payment for services"" had been written
in.

In his second declaration, he referred to and verified a hand
written statement which he had signed dated May 21, 1976, in these terms:

May 21, 1976. To whom it may concern

Any evidence I gave at the Douglas Palmer trial in 1976 was
not of my own free will. I was pressured into saying what I said and also
promised payment of $60,000 dollars. I never had any drug dealings with Doug
Palmer, Don Palmer, Tom Duncan or Jake Smith. Any drug dealings I had were on
my own and had nothing whatsoever to do with the above mentioned names. In
April 1976 I rec. $25,000 Cash from the R.C.M.P.

Fred Ford

Also I had dealings with Roy Twaddell and he asked me to
introduce him to Doug Palmer and I said I knew nothing about him and as far as
I know he only dealt with me in drugs until he went to jail. Fred Ford.

Witnessed: J. Wood

J. B. Clarke

In his third declaration dated October 7, 1976, he swore to the
truth of another statement he had prepared and which bears date October 7,
1976, and which is in these terms:

Oct. 7/1976

To whom it may concern.

My name is Frederick Thomas Ford of Vane. B.C. Everything I
am about to write in this statement is the truth and I am writing it of my own
free will without any threats or inducements from anyone! I started deal­ing in
Heroin (drugs) in 1972. My nephew worked for me burying drugs and got caught, I
went to the police and made a deal to turn someone in if they gave him a stay
of proceedings (which they did). I talked with R.C.M.P. Staff Sgt. Jim Locker.
He asked me if I knew a person named Doug Palmer, I said Yes and he said we

[Page 768]

want him for dealing in drugs and we will let you deal in
drugs without getting caught if you can help us nail Doug Palmer. I didn't
really know a thing about Doug Palmer but I saw an easy way for me to stay on
the street and make money. I kept telling them different stories about Palmer
none of them true! In Jan. 1975 I was shot in front of my home 3475 Triumph St.
The R.C.M.P. (Neil McKay) came and saw me at the hospital he said it was a
hired killer paid for by Doug Palmer. I knew this was not so but in order for
me to get their protection I played along with what they said. In Feb. or Mar.
1975 I went to a Preliminary hearing concerning a drug case against Doug Palmer
and some assoc. I got up on the stand and made up a bunch of lies only because
I didn't want to go to jail also I was promised a large cash settlement new
I.D. and transpor­tation to anywhere I wanted to go. Naturally I would not turn
this down.

The R.C.M.P. kept me and provided myself and family with
$1200.00 per month to live on. In Jan. 1976. They took me to the Plaza 500
Hotel on 12th Ave Vane. There Staff Sgt. Almrud, Neil McKay and other R.C.M.P.
officers kept harrassing me and threatening me to get on the stand and say some
things about Doug Palmer. By then I was in so deep I had to go along. Niel
McKay said he could not tell me personally how much I would get but he told
Corp. Hoivik to tell me I would get $60,000 some I.D. and relokate me. The
Prosecutor Art McLennan and Neil McKay came to see me and threatened me with
all kinds of charges if I did not give evidence at the trial of Doug Palmer.
They said make sure I brought up Doug Palmer's name any chance I got. So I gave
the same evidence was before (All Lies) After the trial they took me and my
family to Victoria B.C. At the end of April 1976 they took me to there office
on Heather St. and offered me $25,000 so I said no. Finally I went to the Bank
of Commerce (Main Branch) Hastings St. with Inspector Elman and got $25,000. He
said I would have to wait for the other $35,000 and take it up with Neil McKay
when he got back from holidays. I'm still waiting! In regards to ""Roy
Twaddell"" I sold him drugs for months and months. He owed me $2,000 I had
him beat tip to make him pay me. It was the day after that I was shot. I
believe he had it done! There is no proof, but I heard through the grape vine
it was him! He couldn't possibly have been getting drugs from anyone else as he
had no money. I had to give him credit every time he got heroin off of me. I
believe like me he was scared and promised lots of things

[Page 769]

to induce him to take the stand against Doug Palmer. The
Police (R.C.M.P.) told me time and again they would do anything to nail Doug
Palmer.

This Statement is all true—

His final declaration dated October 13, 1976, contains serious
charges against the police and Crown counsel. It takes the form of answers to a
series of questions put to him in writing by solici­tors acting for the
appellants in the matter. The questions were not leading in nature, they merely
directed Ford's attention to matters and incidents that he had apparently
raised. Since the answers are contained in the declaration, and provide such
evidence as the declaration is capable of giving, I have omitted the questions.
I reproduce the decla­ration hereunder:

CANADA 

PROVINCE OF 

BRITISH COLUMBIA

IN THE MATTER OF FREDERICK THOMAS FORD AND DONALD PALMER, DOUGLAS
GARNET PALMER, THOMAS DUNCAN, JOHN ALBERT SMITH, ROBERT PORTER AND CLIFFORD
LUTHALA

TO WIT:

I, FREDERICK THOMAS FORD, of the City of Vancou­ver, in the
Province of British Columbia, DO SOLEMNLY DECLARE:

1) I think I met Twaddell late 1973 or early 1974. Sold him
drugs of and on for 1 yr. Was introduced to him through Oscar Hansen on the
1900 Turner St. I sold him drugs on credit!

2) Neil McKay and Art Mclennan [Crown counsel] came to the
Plaza 500 Hotel in January 1976 and told me I had better testify at Doug
Palmer's trial or I would have so many charges against me I would never see day
light. Also they said you'll be killed as soon as you get in the Pen (jail).
Also they said to use Doug P. name every chance I got!

[Page 770]

3) They said not to mention money promised only to answer
that I would be relocated elsewhere not to elaborate any further. This was said
to me many times.

4) They came to me in Jan. 1976, at Plaza 500 and showed me
pictures of Doug P., his brother, Roy Dorn, Tom Duncan, and many others and the
same thing as before. Kept insisting I take stand and give evidence against
Doug P. They said they really wanted him.

5) It was in 1975 Jan. I was shot! They put me into
protective custody. I was really scared! I would have done or said almost
anything at that point. They said they would pay me $25,000 and relocate me. I
agreed! They are—Neil McKay and Art Mclennan.

6) Stayed at Plaza 500 1 wk. before and 1 wk. after.
Corporal Art Hoivik was instructed to make sure I read transcripts and to
memorize. He read me questions and I answered them.

7) Neil McKay came to see me after and kept on insisting I
testify or I would be charged with many charges. He kept saying Doug P. had me
shot and it was my only way to get even.

8) My nerves were shot. So the R.C.M.P. on Neil McKay's
orders went to a doctor and get me sleeping pills (I was taking 3 at once) also
I had codine pills 1 wk. before and 1 wk. after trial.

9) Same as question (2).

10) I had 2 robbery and poss. jewellery against me they said
these would be dropped. But if I did not testify I would be charged with a lot
more than that!

11) Art Mclennan came to see me 2 or three times at Plaza
500. He also said I had no choice but to testify at Doug P. trial. He said you
will make money and be clear of all charges. If you don't testify you will have
many charges against you.

12) Neil McKay and Art Mclennan both told me I would be paid
the date after I gave my evidence!

13) After I gave my evidence Neil McKay Art Hoivik and other
R.C.M.P. officers were in room with me. They all said we have got Palmer for
sure now.

14) While at Plaza 500 I told Staff Sgt. Almrud I would not
testify for $25,000. He said how much do you

[Page 771]

want? I said $60,000. He( said I do not have the author­ity
to authorize it, I'll be back later with answer. He came back a couple of hours
later and said okay you can have $60,000 if you give evidence, Art Hoivik was
there at the time. He also told me Neil McKay said $60,000 but for me not to
mention money on stand.

15) Neil McKay told Corp. Hoivik to tell me about money as
if he told me himself and was asked directly on stand about money and me he
would have to answer truthfully, but if someone else told me he could say I
never talked with Mr. Ford regarding any monies.

16) Same as No. (14).

17) Art Mclennan gave the transcripts to Neil McKay and he
gave them to me. They both said to read trans. and to be more specific!

18) Neil McKay Art Mclennan and every R.C.M.P. officer I
came in contact with kept saying I should testify against D. Palmer.

19) As I've said before—I was in 24 hr. contact with
R.C.M.P. they all kept at me to testify and nail D. Palmer.

20) Went to Heather St. as it is main office. Inspector
Ehman was there. He took me to Main Branch of C. Imperial Commerce on Hastings.
Signed money draft and I was paid right in Bank. Cash and travellers cheques. I
told him I was to get $60,000 not $25,000. He said he was not aware of this but
to take it up with Neil McKay and Inspector White when they returned from
holidays in 2 wks. Which I did. They said they were sorry but Ottawa would not
pay anymore than $25,000. I'm still waiting for my other $35,000.00.

21) Met White after I was shot. He said in his office that
any deals I was to make would be through Neil McKay.

22) Have telephoned Art Mclellan and he said he told
R.C.M.P. to pay me the other $35,000. He can't understand why they haven't kept
up there part of bargain!

23) Whenever I refer to D. Palmer or Doug P. in this
statutory declaration I am in fact referring to Douglas Palmer.

AND I make this solemn declaration, conscientiously
believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same

[Page 772]

force and effect as if made under oath and by virtue of the
""Canada Evidence Act "".

DECLARED before me at the City of Vancouver, in the Province
of British Columbia, this 13th day of October, A.D. 1976,

In reply to this motion, the Crown filed exten­sive material.
Arthur MacLennan, Crown counsel, denied, in his affidavit, all improprieties
alleged by Ford. He swore that he saw Ford in the Plaza Hotel only once. They
had an interview lasting three or four minutes during which he showed Ford some
photographs and left a transcript of Ford's evidence taken at the preliminary
hearing so any mistakes could be corrected. He explained his actions regarding money
in paras. 6, 7 and 8 in these words:

6. THAT I at no time, nor did Sgt. McKay at any time in my
presence, say to Ford that he would receive $25,000.00 or any sum whatsoever,
nor that Ford would be paid the day after he gave his evidence, or at any time;

7. THAT in or about the month of May 1976, Ford telephoned
me to request that I assist him in obtaining a further $35,000.00 from the RCM
Police. At that time I had become aware that Ford had already received
$25,000.00 in lieu of the relocation arrangements to which he had testified at
the trial. I told Ford that notwithstanding he had himself elected after the
trial to receive $25,000.00 instead of the relocation he had been promised, I
had already tried to get for him some additional money because I felt he might
come to harm if he remained in the Vancouver vicinity; that a lump sum payment
totalling $60,000.00 was perhaps not excessive to keep him out of danger until
he could establish himself elsewhere. I also informed Ford on that occasion
that a superintendent of the RCM Police had refused to recommend payment of any
further money as considered Ford's insistence on a further payment to be close
to blackmail. Ford replied that he would never try to blackmail the RCMP; that
he had already given his evidence and was not about to change that;

[Page 773]

8. THAT I never at any time told Ford I could not understand
why the RCMP had not ""kept up their part of the bargain;""

The various police officers mentioned by Ford in his declarations
denied any impropriety in their affidavits. They denied any harassing of Ford
or the putting of any pressures upon him. From their affidavits the Crown
position is made clear. There was an arrangement with Ford that he would give
evidence against the Palmers. At the preliminary hearing as at the trial Ford
admitted the particu­lars of this arrangement. A condition of the arrangement
was that the police would provide protection, and maintenance payments in the
amount of $1,200 a month, until the trial was over. Thereafter provision would
be made for the main­tenance and relocation of Ford and his family, as well as
for their protection until he could reestab­lish himself elsewhere. The
payments made for relocation would have included travelling and moving expenses
and, if necessary, a down payment on a new house. Pursuant to this arrangement,
Ford gave evidence at the preliminary and no difficulties arose until just
before the trial.

According to the police affidavits, at that time Ford seemed to
have changed his mind. He decid­ed that he wanted a cash payment rather than
relocation expenses as agreed. He requested a sum in the neighbourhood of
$50,000 and indicated that he would go to England to live after the trial and
from this cash payment he would cover his own expenses. The police officers who
were responsible for the immediate custody and protec­tion of Ford agreed to
take the matter up with superior officers and, in discussions between
themselves, considered that a $60,000 payment would not be unreasonable in the
circumstances. This figure would presumably have replaced all pay­ments for
maintenance, moving and relocation expenses until Ford was reestablished after
trial and what could be required for a down payment on a house. It is not clear
from the evidence what recommendations were made to superior officers on this
subject but the Crown, after the trial, was prepared to pay only $25,000. This
payment was arranged by R.C.M.P. Inspector Eyman who met

[Page 774]

Ford, took him to the bank, procured $25,000 by cashing a cheque,
and gave it to Ford in cash and travellers cheques. At the time of payment, he
procured the receipt from Ford exhibited to Ford's first declaration. The Crown
submits that Ford, dissatisfied by the payment of $25,000, and no doubt
influenced by fear as well, has changed his story.

The Court of Appeal, when dealing with the motion, had before it
in addition to the materials already referred to some fifty-four volumes of
evidence from the preliminary hearing and the trial and therefore had a much
greater knowledge of the evidence than could be drawn from the brief summary I
have set out above. In dealing with the motion, McFarlane J. A., speaking for
the Court, said:

Section 610(1) provides that for the purposes of an appeal
under Part XVIII of the Code the Court of Appeal may, if it considers it in the
interests of justice, receive the evidence of any witness. Parliament has here
given the Court a broad discretion to be exercised having regard to its view of
the interests of justice. In my opinion it would not serve the interests of
justice to receive the tendered evidence of Ford and Twaddell because it is
simply not capable of belief. I am satisfied that it is untrue and that any
intelligent adult would reject it as wholly untrustworthy. Moreover, the trial
Judge was well aware of the weaknesses in the testimony of Ford and Twaddell.
He had not found them to be honourable, upright witnesses but he accepted
testimony which they gave because it was consistent with, and in harmony with,
other testimony placed before him. He found the testimony, not the witnesses,
to be credible. In my opinion the tendered evidence if adduced before the trial
Judge or other tribunal of fact could not possibly affect the verdict. This
view is in accord with the decision of this Court in R. v. Stewart (1972),
8 C.C.C. (2d) 137.

I have considered the judgments of the Supreme Court of
Canada in McMartin v. The Queen [1964] S.C.R. 484 and Horsburgh v.
The Queen [1967] S.C.R. 746. I find nothing in those judgments which
requires me to accept this evidence. With particular reference to the latter
judgment, I should add that I do not reject the evidence of Ford on the ground
that he testified and was cross-examined at the trial.

[Page 775]

Parliament has given the Court of Appeal a broad discretion in s.
610(1)(d). The overriding consideration must be in the words of the enactment
""the interests of justice"" and it would not serve the interests of
justice to permit any witness by simply repudiating or changing his trial evi­dence
to reopen trials at will to the general detri­ment of the administration of
justice. Applications of this nature have been frequent and courts of appeal in
various provinces have pronounced upon them—see for example Regina v.
Stewart[1];
Regina v. Foster[2];
Regina v. McDonald[3];
Regina v. Demeter[4]. From
these and other cases, many of which are referred to in the above authorities,
the following principles have emerged:

(1) The evidence should generally not be admit­ted if, by due
diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general
principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases:
see McMartin v. The Queen[5].

(2) The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon
a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.

(3) The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is
reasonably capable of belief, and

(4) It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when
taken with the other evi­dence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected
the result.

The leading case on the application of s. 610(1) of the Criminal
Code is McMartin v. The Queen, supra. Ritchie J., for the Court, made it
clear that while the rules applicable to the introduction of new evidence in
the Court of Appeal in civil cases should not be applied with the same force in
criminal matters, it was not in the best interests of justice that evidence
should be so admitted as a matter of course. Special grounds must be shown to
justify the exercise of this power by the appellate

[Page 776]

court. He considered that special grounds existed because of the
nature of the evidence sought to be adduced and he considered that it should
not be refused admission because of any supposed lack of diligence in procuring
the evi­dence for trial. The test he applied on this question was expressed in
these terms at p. 493:

With the greatest respect, it appears to me that the
evidence tendered by the appellant on such an applica­tion as this is not to be
judged and rejected on the ground that it ""does not disprove the verdict
as found by the jury"" or that it fails to discharge the burden of proving
that the appellant was incapable of planning and deliberation, or that it does
not rebut inferences which appear to have been drawn by the jury. It is enough,
in my view, if the proposed evidence is of sufficient strength that it might
reasonably affect the verdict of a jury.

The evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.

In my view, the approach taken in the authori­ties cited above
follows that of this Court in McMartin. The evidence in question in the
case at bar was not available at trial and it would be, if received, relevant
to the issue of guilt on the part of the Palmers. The evidence sought to be
intro­duced in McMartin was evidence of an expert opinion not of matters
of fact and therefore no issue of credibility in the ordinary sense arose. It
is clear, however, that in dealing with matters of fact a consideration of
whether, in the words of Ritchie J., the evidence possessed sufficient strength
that ""it might reasonably affect the verdict of the jury"" involves a
consideration of its credibility as well as its probative force if presented to
the trier of fact.

Because the evidence was not available at trial and because it
bears on a decisive issue, the inqui­ry in this case is limited to two
questions. Firstly, is the evidence possessed of sufficient credibility that it
might reasonably have been believed by the trier of fact? If the answer is no
that ends the matter but if yes the second question presents itself in this
form. If presented to the trier of fact and

[Page 777]

believed, would the evidence possess such strength or probative
force that it might, taken with the other evidence adduced, have affected the
result? If the answer to the second question is yes, the motion to adduce new
evidence would have to succeed and a new trial be directed at which the
evidence could be introduced.

It is evident that the Court of Appeal applied the test of
credibility and found the evidence ten­dered as to the validity of Ford's trial
evidence to be wholly unworthy of belief. It therefore refused the motion and
in so doing made no error in law which would warrant interference by this
Court. While it may not be necessary to do so in view of this conclusion, I
express the view that the Court of Appeal was fully justified in reaching the
conclusion it did upon a consideration of all the evidence adduced on the
motion before it and the evidence appearing in the trial transcripts.

It was argued for the appellants that Ford's trial evidence was
totally fabricated as a result of police pressures and inducements. In his
declarations, Ford says that he was frightened and under pres­sure and
accordingly when the time for the preliminary hearing came he merely got in the
witness box and made up a bunch of lies. It should be noted, however, that at
the trial, almost a year later, he gave the same evidence and, despite
strenuous cross-examination on both occasions, no assertion is made that there
was any significant difference in the evidence. The accurate repetition of
extemporaneous inventions after such a long interval would be a remarkable
performance on Ford's part under any circumstances but, when one adds the fact
that the trial judge considered that his evidence was in harmony with the
general picture of events which emerged from the evidence of many other
witnesses, it becomes impossible to believe that the evidence was fabricated on
the spur of t e moment. Furthermore, it should be observed that the
modification of the financial arrangements with Ford occurred, according to
Ford's own declaration, after the preliminary hear­ing where he had given
evidence and before the

[Page 778]

trial when, it is conceded, he repeated it. It is impossible to
believe that the nature of his evi­dence given at trial was affected by the
payment or promise of money. Considering the suggestion that this arrangement
was undisclosed and that the trial judge could therefore have been misled in
his assessment of Ford's credibility, reference may be made to a passage in his
reasons for judgment where he said:

Ford testifies that the police promised to protect him and
his family if he gave evidence on behalf of the Crown, and that they have
fulfilled this promise by paying for the cost of relocating him and his family,
and of maintaining them since February 1975. The cost of such maintenance said
to have been $l,200 a month.

A careful review of the police evidence drawn from the affidavits
filed confirms the version of the agreement made with Ford which he himself
described in evidence at the trial. The police con­tention that Ford changed
his mind shortly before the trial and wanted cash in lieu of unspecified
relocation expenses is confirmed, at least in part, by Ford's later acceptance
of the sum of $25,000 and his insistence upon more. It seems clear that he
abandoned the original arrangement in favour of a sum of money as contended by
the police. It was argued that the police had offered $60,000 when all that
Ford had sought was $50,000. The police affidavits confirm that Ford requested
a sum in the neighbourhood of $50,000. It also appears from the affidavits that
the police officers themselves said, after some discussion between themselves,
that they would recommend $60,000 to their superior officers. When it is
considered that this payment was to be in lieu of all other provision for Ford
after the trial and that it would serve to cover all the expenses involved in
mainte­nance for Ford and his family including travel and relocation expenses
and even a possible down payment on a new house, it does not seem an unrea­sonable
amount.

The manner of payment of the $25,000 to Ford, which involved no
secrecy and was done openly by cheque, negates improper motives on the part of
the police. The use of the words ""services ren­dered"" and
""services"" on the receipt has, in my

[Page 779]

opinion, no sinister significance. It is evident that these words
were employed to describe the arrangement here discussed. In my opinion, the
rejection of Ford's evidence by the Court of Appeal was amply justified.

I cannot leave this part of the case without making some general
remarks upon the situation it reveals. There can be no doubt that from time to
time the interests of justice will require that Crown witnesses in criminal
cases be protected. Their lives and the lives of their families and the safety
of their property may be endangered. In such cases the use of public funds to
provide the necessary protection will not be improper. When the need arises,
the form of protection and the amount and method of the disbursement of moneys
will vary widely and it is impossible to predict the precise form the required
protection will take.

The dangers inherent in this situation are obvi­ous. On the one
hand, interference with witnesses cannot be tolerated because the integrity of
the entire judicial process depends upon the ability of parties to causes in
the courts to call witnesses who can give their evidence free from fears and
exter­nal pressures, secure in the knowledge that neither they nor the members
of their families will suffer in retaliation. On the other hand, the courts
must be astute to see that no steps are taken, in afford­ing protection to
witnesses, which would influence evidence against the accused or in any way
preju­dice the trial or lead to a miscarriage of justice. However, in cases
where the courts are, after careful examination, satisfied that only reasonable
and necessary protection has been provided and that no prejudice or miscarriage
of justice has resulted in consequence, they should not draw unfavourable
inferences against the Crown, by reason only of this expenditure of public
funds.

It must be recognized that when cases of this nature arise,
charges of bribery of witnesses will, from time to time, be made. It is for
this reason that the courts must be on guard to detect and to deal severely
with any attempt to influence or corrupt witnesses. The courts must discharge
this duty with the greatest care to ensure that while no impropriety upon the
part of the Crown will be

[Page 780]

permitted, the provision of reasonable and neces­sary protection
for witnesses is not a prohibited practice. In the United States, there are
statutory provisions expressly contemplating such expendi­ture under the
authority of the Attorney General.

I now turn to the second point raised in this appeal. There was
evidence at trial, resulting from police surveillance, that Ford and Douglas
Palmer met on three separate occasions. It was presumably led to afford some
evidence of association between them. On July 18, 1972, Ford was seen to leave
a car and walk up Palmer's driveway then return to the car in three or four
minutes and depart. Ford, in giving evidence in chief, was not asked about this
incident and he was not cross-examined about it. Palmer disclaimed any
knowledge of Ford's visit. On November 8, 1972, Palmer was seen travelling in
Ford's automobile as a passenger with Ford driving. Ford was not exam­ined or
cross-examined on this incident. Palmer said that he had been waiting at a bus stop
near his home because he was going to pick up a truck which was under repair
and Ford happened by in his car and gave him a lift. The event he said was not
prearranged. On January 23, 1973, at 11:30 p.m., Ford was observed leaving his
automobile from which he went down a driveway to Palmer's house and spoke to
Douglas Palmer for a few minutes then returned to his car and left. Ford, as
before, gave no evidence relating to this event and was not cross-examined upon
it. Palmer said that Ford had come to his house and offered to sell some tires
at a reasonable price and Palmer had merely sent him away. Palmer was not
cross-examined on his evidence relating to the three meetings.

The trial judge found that Palmer was not a credible witness and
indicated that he was not willing to accept his testimony on important mat­ters.
In dealing with this question, he made refer­ence to these incidents as well as
much other evidence. Counsel for Palmer objects to this on the basis that
Palmer's version of what occurred on these occasions stands uncontroverted and,
particularly in view of the Crown's failure to examine Ford upon these matters,
it is argued that the trial

[Page 781]

judge should have accepted Palmer's version of events and not
drawn inferences adverse to him. The point was summarized in the appellants'
factum in these words:

It is submitted that the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia erred in concluding that it was not necessary for the prosecution to
have examined Ford in-chief with respect to the three incidents and that it was
not neces­sary to cross-examine the Appellant Douglas Garnet Palmer when he
testified with respect to the said three incidents. Had the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia found that the learned trial Judge had erred in rejecting the
testimony of Douglas Garnet Palmer with respect to the said three incidents
then the basis for the learned trial Judge's acceptance of Ford's testimony
would have disappeared and the Court of Appeal would then have quashed the
convictions against the Appellants.

In dealing with this argument in the Court of Appeal, McFarlane
J.A. said for the Court:

The second ground of appeal argued was that the trial Judge
should have found that the evidence of Douglas Palmer raised at least a
reasonable doubt of his guilt. With particular reference to the three occasions
to which I have just referred, it was said that Palmer's evidence was not
shaken in cross-examination and it is suggested he was not specifically
questioned about one or two of them. Reference was made to Browne v. Dunn (1894)
The Reports 67 and to Rex v. Hart (1932) 23 C.A.R. 202. I respectfully
agree with the observation of Lord Morris in the former case at page 79:

I therefore wish it to be understood that I would not concur
in ruling that it was necessary in order to impeach a witnesses' credit, that
you should take him through the story which he had told, giving him notice by
questions that you impeached his credit.

In my opinion the effect to be given to the absence or
brevity of cross-examination depends upon the circum­stances of each case.
There can be no general or absolute rule. It is a matter of weight to be
decided by the tribunal of fact, vide: Sam v. Canadian Pacific
Limited (1976) 63 D.L.R. (3d) 294 and cases cited there by
Robertson, J.A. at 315-7. In the present case Douglas Palmer was cross-examined
extensively. It seems to me the circumstances are such that it must have been
foreseen his credit would be attacked if he testified to his innocence. In any
event, this was made plain when he was cross-examined. The trial Judge gave a
careful explanation for his acceptance of the story of Ford and

[Page 782]

rejecting that of Douglas Palmer. I cannot give effect to this
ground of appeal.

I am in full agreement with these words and I do not consider it
necessary to add to them save to emphasize that the finding against the
credibility of Palmer was made upon much more than the evidence of these three
events. It was based upon a consideration of the whole of the evidence includ­ing
the full examination and cross-examination of Palmer. I would dismiss the
appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN

Criminal law—Application for writ of habeas
corpus ad subjiciendum—Court of Appeal reducing sentences of imprisonment to
terms of less than two years—Sentences imposed on appellant made before
expiration of sentence of imprisonment in a penitentiary—Warrants of committal
directing imprisonment in a correctional institution result of administrative
error—Appellant properly convicted and sentenced, and required to serve his
sentences in a penitentiary—Criminal Code , s. 659(2) .

APPEAL pursuant to s. 719(3)  of the Criminal Code  from
a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan which dismissed the
appellant’s appeal from the judgment of Sirois J. who refused the appellant’s
application for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum. Appeal
dismissed.

No one appearing for the appellant.

Eric A. Bowie, for the respondent.

THE COURT—This is an appeal pursuant to subs.
719(3) of the Criminal Code  of Canada from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan which dismissed the
appellant’s appeal from the judgment of Sirois J. who refused the appellant’s
application for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum.

As the result of a number of sentences and
releases commencing in January 1974, the appellant was released from the
Penitentiary on June 14, 1978, on mandatory supervision. That mandatory
supervision was to end on September 21, 1978. Instead, it was suspended on September l, 1978, and he was retaken
into custody on September 6, 1978. His mandatory supervision was revoked on September 8, 1978.

[Page 809]

On September 6, 1978, at Camrose, Alberta,
the appellant pleaded guilty and was convicted of two offences under the Criminal
Code , for each of which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two
years, the two to be served concurrently. The two warrants of committal order
that the accused be imprisoned in a penitentiary. On September 27, 1978, he was
again convicted in Alberta of
an offence under the Criminal Code . He was then sentenced to serve nine
months consecutive to the two sentences above-mentioned, but the warrant of
committal mentioned imprisonment in a provincial correctional institution.

In the result the appellant was committed to the
Saskatchewan Penitentiary.

These three sentences were all appealed by the
appellant to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. On January 17, 1979, that Court set aside all three
sentences and substituted in their place the following three sentences:

(a) two years less one day;

(b) two years less one day concurrent;

(c) nine months concurrent with the other
sentences.

To allow him to appear in person before the
Alberta Court of Appeal the appellant was on January 5, 1979, taken to the Fort
Saskatchewan Correctional Institution.

Following the decision of the Appellate Division
made January 17, 1979, the
appellant was returned to the Saskatchewan Penitentiary where he has since
remained.

However, the three warrants of committal of the
Appellate Division stated on their face that:

…on the 17th day of January, A.D. 1979, it
was adjudged that the Appellant for his offence be imprisoned in any
Correctional Institution in the said Province.

The appellant submits that he is improperly
detained in the Saskatchewan Penitentiary because these warrants of committal,
issued after the judgment of the Appellate Division by the

[Page 810]

Deputy Registrar, stated that “it was adjudged
that the appellant for his offence be imprisoned in any Correctional
Institution in the said Province”, i.e. Alberta, and directed the keeper of such Institution to imprison him there.
His contention is that in view of these warrants his detention in the
Saskatchewan Penitentiary is not lawful.

The Crown relies on the provisions of subs.
659(2). The sentences imposed on the appellant in Alberta were made before the expiration of his sentence of imprisonment in
the penitentiary.

Subsections (1) and (2) of s. 659 of
the Criminal Code provide as follows:

659. (1) Except where otherwise provided, a
person who is sentenced to imprisonment for

(a) life,

(b) a term of two years or
more, or

(c) two or more terms of less than
two years each that are to be served one after the other and that, in the
aggregate, amount to two years or more,

shall be sentenced to imprisonment in a
penitentiary.

(2) Where a person who is sentenced to
imprisonment in a penitentiary is, before the expiration of that sentence,
sentenced to imprisonment for a term of less than two years, he shall be
sentenced to and shall serve that term in a penitentiary, but if the previous
sentence of imprisonment in a penitentiary is set aside, he shall serve that
term in accordance with subsection (3).

The Court was concerned as to whether the
judgments of the Appellate Division had, in the words of the warrants, adjudged
that the appellant be imprisoned in a Correctional Institution in Alberta. At the request of the Court,
counsel for the Crown obtained and provided copies of the Court’s judgments.
There is no such direction. The judgments allow the appeals against sentence
and substitute new sentences for those imposed at trial, as previously
described.

In view of these circumstances, it appears that
the form of the warrants of committal directing imprisonment in a Correctional
Institute in Alberta were the result of an administrative error and are
defective in that respect.

[Page 811]

In the result, the appellant was properly
convicted and sentenced and, in the light of subs. 659(2), is required to serve
his sentences in a penitentiary. He is not unlawfully detained in the
Saskatchewan Penitentiary.

The appeal is therefore dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Murder—Non-capital
murder—Defences—Provocation not raised by defence—Duty of trial judge to
instruct jury as to provocation—Failure of trial judge to instruct on influence
of drugs or alcohol—Refusal by Court of Appeal of motion to adduce fresh
evidence—Discretion of Court of Appeal—Criminal Code , ss. 215 , 610 ,

Criminal law—Jury—Evidence—Readback to jury
after commencement of deliberations—Error in permitting readback of direct
examination only—Qualifying evidence not read back—Criminal Code , s.
613 (l)(b)(iii).

The appeal is against a conviction for
non-capital murder and comes to the Supreme Court of Canada by virtue of s.
618(1)(a) on two grounds raised in dissent in the Court of Appeal.
First, that the learned trial judge’s failure to direct the jury that, if there
was a wrongful act or insult sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the
power of self-control, they should consider the influence of drugs on the
accused in deciding whether in fact he was or might have been responding to
provocation was non-direction amounting to misdirection, and, second, it could
not be said in the circumstances that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice resulted therefrom. Leave to appeal was also given to allege error on
the trial judge’s part in failing to instruct the jury on the law as to the
treatment of accomplices’ evidence; and in failing to respond to the jury’s
request to have the evidence of a witness read back after they had commenced
their deliberations; and further that the Court of Appeal erred in its
dismissal of a motion to adduce fresh evidence, pursuant to s. 610 , on the
hearing of the appeal.

Held (Laskin
C.J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Pigeon,
Dickson, Beetz, Estey, Pratte and McIntyre JJ.: At trial appellant relied upon
self-defence. The

[Page 1009]

defence of provocation was not argued and
defence counsel did not ask the trial judge to direct the jury upon it. The
defence relied on the description of events given by the appellant to support
the self-defence theory. The trial judge however considered that there was
evidence to support the defence of provocation under s. 215  of the Criminal
Code  and put that defence to the jury. Appellant did not raise the defence
of provocation and at no time did he say that he had been provoked into violent
action by the words and conduct of the deceased. In fact, his description of
events went far to negate any suggestion of provocation. His evidence was of an
attack, to which he reacted not on the sudden, but by defending himself; he
considered that the deceased was reaching for a gun and, in fear of his life,
he shot and killed him. Both Courts below considered, however, that there was
some evidence of provocation which required the putting of that charge on
provocation to the jury and, of course, when a direction is put it should be
put correctly. Where there is evidence of intoxication of an accused by drugs
or alcohol, and the defence of provocation is raised, the jury must be directed
that they are entitled to consider and should consider what effect such
intoxication might have had upon the accused. They should be told to consider
whether his power of self-control had been affected to the point where he might
be deprived, in whole or in part, of his normal ability to restrain himself in
circumstances which could amount to provocation. In this case, on application
of the test in Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739, the
judge’s error was not fatal to the conviction.

Per Laskin
C.J., dissenting: It is not necessary to deal with any point raised by
the appellant save that relating to the issue of provocation and the relation
of intoxication and drug-taking to it. Although provocation was not raised by
the appellant at his trial, the judge acted upon the long established rule of
our criminal law of putting to the jury any relevant issue revealed by the
evidence, even if the accused did not raise it. In doing so, his instruction
fell short of what the jury was entitled to have in order to come to a
conclusion of fact whether the accused was guilty of manslaughter only or of
murder. While the evidence of provocation may have appeared slim to the Court
of Appeal, it was not the function of that Court to weigh it and usurp the role
of the jury. Indeed, it was recognized by the majority in that Court that even
if the jury was in reasonable doubt on the issue of provocation, a matter on
which it should have been charged and was not, the accused was entitled to the

[Page 1010]

benefit of that doubt and to have the charge
reduced to manslaughter.

As to the application by the majority in the
Court of Appeal of s. 613 (l)(b)(iii), this section should not be
applied to cure a defective charge on an issue touching culpability, once it is
concluded that there is evidence on that issue fit to go to the jury.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] dismissing an
appeal against a conviction for non-capital murder. Appeal dismissed, Laskin
C.J. dissenting.

Clayton Ruby and Dianne L. Martin, for
the appellant.

David H. Doherty, for the respondent.

The following are the reasons delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—The
appellant was convicted on February 18, 1974, after trial before Callon J. and
a jury, of the non-capital murder of one Paul Patterson. He appealed to the
Ontario Court of Appeal by a notice of appeal dated October 17, 1975 and
expanded his grounds of appeal by a supplementary notice of appeal given on
January 28, 1977. On February 9, 1977, he gave notice of motion to adduce fresh evidence before the Court
of Appeal, pursuant to s. 610(1)  of the Criminal Code . That Court
disposed of the motion by the following endorsement on the notice thereof:

The majority of the Court are of the view
that no proper case had been made for the exercise of their discretion

[Page 1011]

to receive fresh evidence; Madam Justice
Wilson is of the contrary view and would have heard the evidence.

The majority of the Court consisted of Dubin and
Martin JJ.A. and, on the merits of the appeal, they concluded, in reasons
delivered by Martin J.A. on December 1, 1977, that the appeal must be
dismissed, Wilson J.A. dissenting.

There were errors of law committed by the trial
judge in his charge to the jury which Martin J.A. pointed out, but he applied
s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , being satisfied that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the errors; that
they were, to borrow an expression used elsewhere, harmless errors. In her
dissent, Wilson J.A. dealt with only one of the points canvassed by the
majority, finding it unnecessary to deal with any of the others. It was, in her
opinion, sufficient ground to set aside the conviction and order a new trial
because of the non-direction amounting to misdirection, on provocation. It was
put weakly to the jury and with a misstatement of the evidence relevant to that
issue and was also, to all intents and purposes, thereafter withdrawn from the
jury. She rejected the Crown’s contention and the view of the majority of the
Court of Appeal that the misdirection was covered by s. 613(1) (b)(iii),
being of the opinion that it was open to a properly instructed jury to bring in
a verdict of manslaughter or to conclude that they were not satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused did not act in response to provocation.

An appeal as of right, founded on Wilson J.A.’s
dissent, was brought to this Court and, in addition, the appellant obtained
leave on February 20, 1978, to
argue other points of appeal in law put before the Court below and, as well, to
challenge the refusal of that Court to admit fresh evidence. Counsel for the
appellant urged this Court to receive the evidence under its power to do so
given by s. 623(1)  of the Criminal Code .

[Page 1012]

In my view of this case, I do not find it
necessary to deal with any point raised by the appellant save that relating to
the issue of provocation and the relation of intoxication and drug-taking to
it. Although provocation was not raised by the accused at his trial, the
presiding Judge acted upon the long established rule of our criminal law of
putting to the jury any relevant issue revealed by the evidence, even if the
accused did not raise it. Thus, the trial Judge put provocation to the jury,
being of the opinion that there was some evidence to support it. However, in so
doing, his instruction to the jury fell short of what the jury was entitled to
have in order to come to a conclusion of fact whether the accused was guilty of
manslaughter only and not of murder. In the Court of Appeal, Martin J.A.
although seemingly hesitatingly, proceeded on the basis of there being evidence
of provocation to go to the jury. He found that the trial Judge had failed to
instruct the jury properly on that issue. The following passages in the reasons
of the learned Justice of Appeal indicate where the failure lay:

The final ground of appeal arises out of
the charge with respect to provocation, in that the trial judge did not
instruct the jury that if there was a wrongful act or insult sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self control, it was proper and
necessary for the jury in deciding whether the accused was actually deprived of
his power of self control, to consider his condition with respect to
drunkenness. See R. v. Haight (1977), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 168. My Brother
Dubin, during the argument of this ground of appeal, also pointed out that the
trial judge’s charge did not expressly relate the principle of reasonable doubt
to the defence of provocation. See Linney v. The Queen (1977), 32 C.C.C.
(2d) 294.

…

…the trial judge did not emphasize, as he
might have, the requirement that the wrongful act or insult be of such a nature
as to deprive an “ordinary” person of the power of self‑control, in order
for the defence of provocation to be available; nor did he withdraw from the
jury’s consideration the appellant’s condition with respect to intoxication on
the issue whether he was actually deprived of the power of self-control. I also
note that the trial judge was in error when he stated that the evidence of the
accused was that the deceased called him “a two-bit nigger punk”, since the
accused in his evi-

[Page 1013]

dence did not say that he heard these words.
This error, however, inured to the benefit of the appellant.

The failure of the trial judge, however, to
instruct the jury that they were entitled to consider the appellant’s condition
with respect to intoxication on the issue whether he was deprived of his power
of self-control, in the event they considered that there was a wrongful act or
insult sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control,
constituted non-direction and it, therefore, becomes necessary to examine this
error in the context of the trial to determine whether it resulted in a
substantial wrong or a miscarriage of justice.

I should point out, as was done by Madam Justice
Wilson in her dissent, that although the accused did not say that he heard the
provocative words “two-bit nigger punk”, he did not deny hearing them, a
feature which distinguishes this case from Parnerkar v. The Queen[2]. The fact that the trial Judge
mis-stated the evidence in saying that the accused testified that the deceased
called him a “two-bit nigger punk” (this evidence came from the Crown witness
Catherine Dwyer) was regarded by Martin J.A. as enuring to the benefit of the
accused. Even so, it does not detract from the duty of the trial Judge to give
proper direction to the jury.

However slim the evidence of provocation may
have appeared to the majority of the Court of Appeal, it was not their function
to weigh it and thus usurp the role of the jury. Indeed, the majority
recognized that even if the jury was in reasonable doubt on the issue of
provocation—a matter on which it should have been charged and was not—the
accused was entitled to the benefit thereof and to have the charge of murder
reduced to manslaughter.

I refrain from any fuller discussion of the
facts and the law respecting provocation, being content to adopt what was said
on that question by Madam Justice Wilson.

This brings me to the question whether it was
proper for the majority to apply s. 613(1) (b)(iii) to cure the
deficiencies in the trial Judge’s charge. Such an application was denied in Linney
v. The Queen[3], but
Martin J.A. was of the opinion that

[Page 1014]

this was because the evidence of provocation was
strong in that case as contrasted with the weak evidence here. This does not
appear to me to be a justifiable distinction, especially when in Linney the
only defect in the charge to the jury which constituted reversible error was
the trial Judge’s failure to relate reasonable doubt to provocation. Here there
were other defects in the charge, already noted above, but, apart from this, I
cannot be persuaded that it is ever proper to apply s. 613(1) (b)(iii) to
cure a defective charge on an issue touching culpability, once it is concluded
that there is evidence on that issue fit to go to the jury.

In my opinion, the appeal should be allowed and
a new trial ordered. One of the distressing features of this case is the length
of time it has taken to bring it here. I have pointed to the date of the
alleged offence, November 2, 1972, the date of conviction, February 18, 1974,
the date October 17, 1975 (showing a long delay) of the notice of appeal to the
Court of Appeal and I have referred to the lapse of more than a year before a
supplementary notice of appeal was filed on January 28, 1977. My surmise is
that legal aid proceedings accounted for some of the delay in the appeal
process below. More expedition should be expected both from counsel and from
legal aid in criminal matters.

The judgment of Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz, Estey,
Pratte and McIntyre was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—The appellant appeals against his
conviction for non-capital murder on February18, 1974, at Windsor, Ontario. His appeal to the Ontario
Court of Appeal was dismissed on December 1, 1977, Dubin and Martin JJ.A., (Wilson J.A. dissenting). This appeal
comes before this Court by virtue of s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  upon two grounds raised in the dissenting judgment of Wilson J.A.
which are set out hereunder:

[Page 1015]

1. That the learned trial judge’s failure
to direct the jury that, if there was a wrongful act or insult sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, they should consider
the influence of drugs on the accused in deciding whether in fact he was or
might have been responding to provocation was non-direction amounting to misdirection
and,

2. It could not be said in the
circumstances that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice resulted
therefrom,

and on broader terms by leave granted February
20, 1978.

The broader grounds allege that the trial judge
erred in that he did not instruct the jury on the law relating to the treatment
of accomplices’ evidence; that there was error in responding to the jury’s
request to have the evidence of a witness read back after they had commenced
their deliberations; and that the Court of Appeal was in error in dismissing
the appellant’s motion to adduce fresh evidence pursuant to s. 610  of the Criminal
Code  on the hearing of the appeal.

The facts are well set out in the judgment of
Martin J.A. for the majority of the Court of Appeal. On November 1, 1972, several people gathered in the
apartment in Windsor of one Thornton. Thornton was said to be a dealer in drugs and his apartment was frequently
used as a drug house or resort of drug users. A variety of illicit drugs was
used on that occasion. All or most of those present used marijuana,
barbiturates, amphetamines and heroin in varying amounts and combinations. A
principal Crown witness named Catherine Dwyer arrived at about 7:00 p.m. with a
young sister aged seventeen. Thornton, Philip Cloutier, and John Baylis were
there upon her arrival. The appellant arrived about 8:00 p.m. He was known to Dwyer who had met
him on previous visits to Thornton’s apartment. Shortly after arrival, the appellant produced a
revolver which he began to clean. About one-half hour later, Larry Lamont,
described by Dwyer as the appellant’s partner, arrived. At about 11:00 p.m.,
Dwyer and her sister left the apartment and at this time, Patterson, the
deceased, arrived. Dwyer said she heard the appellant say “He didn’t like damn

[Page 1016]

Yankees”. He was apparently referring to the
deceased who lived in Detroit.

Miss Dwyer returned to Thornton’s apartment about 1:00 a.m. on November 2nd. Her sister wanted to use the bedroom of the
apartment to do her school homework. When Dwyer and her sister entered the
bedroom they found the appellant who, according to Dwyer, was “stoned”, that
is, severely intoxicated from barbiturates. He wanted to use a phone which was
in the room but was unable to dial the number. Dwyer dialed it for him but he
was apparently unable to complete a conversation, dozing off to sleep and
generally appearing to be in a near comatose condition. Dwyer then went to the
den in the apartment with the appellant, leaving her sister in the bedroom. The
appellant left the den and entered the dining room where the deceased and one
Margaret Rau were sitting at the table. The appellant called the deceased a
“two-bit dope peddlar” and spoke words to the effect that “I am a better drug
dealer than you are”. Dwyer said that the appellant seemed aggressive and that
the deceased appeared to be trying to “keep Olbey, the appellant, cool” and to
avoid “harassing him in any way”. The appellant left shortly and went into the
den. Dwyer then went into the kitchen to wash dirty dishes. She returned to the
den shortly and spoke with the appellant. She said he was still very stoned.

About 2:00 a.m. Thornton and Margaret Rau left
to get some food. On their return the food was eaten in the dining room. Then
Dwyer commenced to clean up. She was in the kitchen doing dishes when she heard
the deceased call the appellant a “two-bit punk” or “a two-bit nigger punk”.
She heard a chair falling and she stepped back so she could see into the dining
room. She said that she saw the appellant holding a gun pointing it at the
deceased. The deceased and the appellant were about eight feet apart and she
saw the appellant

[Page 1017]

fire a shot. It seemed to spin the deceased
around so he was facing the appellant. The deceased clutched his stomach and
started walking or staggering towards the appellant. The appellant took a
couple of steps back and fired a second time. The deceased turned completely
around and fell to the floor upon his back. The appellant then fired a third
shot at the deceased while he lay on the floor. Dwyer estimated that all three
shots were fired within a period of five to six seconds. She said that the
shooting took place about 3:00 a.m. and she also swore that there was an interval of four or five
minutes between the time the deceased made the insulting remark or remarks to
the appellant and the time she observed the first shot being fired. In
cross-examination, she said that the outward signs of drug intoxication she had
observed on the appellant at about 1:00 a.m. had diminished by 3:00 a.m. In answer to a question from the bench
regarding the appellant’s condition between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m., she said “from what I could see
he was very much in control of what he was doing”. She also said the deceased
called the appellant a “two-bit nigger punk” after being “harassed” by the
appellant. She said the appellant appeared to be the aggressor. She said she
was normal by 2:00 a.m. but admitted that in the evening she had smoked five or
six marijuana cigarettes sharing them with others present and that she had
taken “three valiums” over an eight-hour period.

There can be no doubt that the deceased died
almost immediately from bullet wounds. After the shooting, again according to
Dwyer, the appellant said that “nobody is calling anybody” in response to a
suggestion that an ambulance be called and, that he tore the telephone cord
from the wall. He said if he went to jail he had friends who would “take care
of these people. Dwyer considered this a threat uttered to enforce silence.

After some discussion, the body was put into the
deceased’s car and it was taken to an open field in the nearby countryside. A
fruitless attempt was made to burn the car with the appellant’s body in it.
Lamont then attempted to deface the body by beating it with a tire iron. The
body was then left

[Page 1018]

in the car where it was eventually found.
Baylis, who was called as a Crown witness, followed in another vehicle, the car
which carried the body and he brought Lamont and the appellant back to Windsor. They remained at Baylis’s
apartment the remainder of the night before going their separate ways the
following day. Dwyer remained in Thornton’s apartment until about noon the next day when she was arrested by
the police. She explained her waiting there by saying that she had been told to
clean up and remove blood stains, which she did in fear of retaliation by the
appellant.

The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf.
He said that he had met the deceased once before in another dope house. He had
seen the deceased carrying a gun on that occasion. During the month of October,
before the killing, friends had told him that the deceased had accepted a
contract to kill him. He denied that he was a drug dealer. He said that he had
received threats over the telephone. He said that he had been shot in the
spring of 1972, before he met the deceased, and that the house in which he
rented accommodation had burned down about two weeks before the killing. He
considered all these circumstances suspicious and he had purchased a gun for
his protection. He had taken barbiturates earlier in the day on December 1st
before going to the Thornton
apartment. He had developed, he said, a tolerance to barbiturates and required
them to function normally. He was “high” when he went to Thornton’s apartment. He said that he saw
the deceased sitting at the dining room table and that the deceased said “You
didn’t burn in the house but you are about to burn in hell”. The deceased added
that “if he was smart” he would “get his little punk ass out of town”. The
appellant replied “No two-bit Yankee dope dealer is going to run me out of
town”. He described the killing by saying that someone had called him into the
dining room. He got into an argument with the deceased. The deceased came
towards him. He was afraid of the deceased because of his size and he punched
at him. The deceased grabbed him. During the scuffle, the deceased tried to put
a bear hug on him. He pushed the deceased back towards the bathroom. The
deceased then said “I am going to kill you punk” and started reaching inside
his sweater. The appellant then shot him believing

[Page 1019]

that the deceased was reaching for a weapon. The
deceased, with his hand still in the sweater, continued to come towards him.
The appellant shot again. He said he didn’t know how many times he pulled the
trigger. He said he was “really stoned”. He then said he frisked the deceased
for a weapon and discovered he didn’t have one.

It will be seen at once that the appellant’s
version is fundamentally different from that of Dwyer. It will also be seen
that his account of the shooting described in great detail, despite his
assertion that he was “really stoned”, a killing in self-defence not one in
response to sudden provocation.

At trial, the appellant relied upon
self-defence. The defence of provocation was not argued and counsel for the
appellant did not ask the trial judge to direct the jury upon it. The defence
relied upon the description of events given by the appellant to support the
self-defence theory. The trial judge, in charging the jury, considered that
there was evidence which would support the defence of provocation under s. 215 
of the Criminal Code . He therefore put that defence to the jury
notwithstanding that the defence had not been put upon that footing.

The first ground of appeal arises from the
refusal of the Court of Appeal to receive new evidence upon the hearing of the
appeal. The appellant’s counsel moved to introduce new evidence at the outset
of the appeal. The notice of motion sought to have the court hear the evidence
of Gerald Tuck, who had been counsel for the appellant at trial; Dr. Eugene
Leblanc, an official of the Department of Health of the Province of Ontario,
concerning the effect of drug use on human behaviour; and Margaret Rau, a woman
who had been present in the Thornton apartment when the killing occurred. The
application was made under s. 610(1)  which is reproduced hereunder:

610. (1) For the purposes of an appeal
under this Part, the court of appeal may, where it considers it in the
interests of justice,

[Page 1020]

(a) order the production of any
writing, exhibit, or other thing connected with the proceedings;

(b) order any witness who
would have been a compellable witness at the trial, whether or not he was
called at the trial,

(i) to attend and be examined before the
court of appeal, or

(ii) to be examined in the manner provided
by rules of court before a judge of the court of appeal, or before any officer
of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or other person appointed by the
court of appeal for the purpose;

(c) admit, as evidence, an
examination that is taken under subparagraph (b)(ii);

(d) receive the evidence, if
tendered, of any witness, including the appellant, who is a competent but not
compellable witness;

(e) order that any question
arising on the appeal that

(i) involves prolonged examination of
writings or accounts, or scientific or local investigation, and

(ii) cannot in the opinion of the court of
appeal conveniently be inquired into before the court of appeal,

be referred for inquiry and report, in the
manner provided by rules of court, to a special commissioner appointed by the
court of appeal; and

(f) act upon the report of a
commissioner who is appointed under paragraph (e) in so far as the court of
appeal thinks fit to do so.

The Court of Appeal dealt with this motion in a
summary way. The motion was dismissed and the notice endorsed with the
following words: 

The majority of the court are of the view
that no proper case had been made for the exercise of their discretion to
review fresh evidence; Madam Justice Wilson is of the contrary view and would
have heard the evidence.

The affidavits filed by the appellant’s counsel
at trial showed he had applied for an adjournment of the trial which commenced
on February 11, 1974, to enable him to consult with and engage a psychiatrist
to give evidence for the defence on the issue of the ability of the appellant
to form an intent to kill or to cause bodily harm. He was refused the
adjournment and he had to rely at trial on the evidence of Dwyer, adverse as
she was, to form any basis for a defence based on the appelants mental
capacity. To repair this deficiency,

[Page 1021]

he sought to have the evidence of Dr. Leblanc
introduced before the Court of Appeal. An examination of Dr. Leblanc’s
affidavit indicates that his evidence would go largely in contradiction of the
evidence of Dwyer as to the mental capacity of the appellant on the issue of
provocation. As such, it would be principally concerned with discrediting Dwyer’s
evidence. The affidavit of Margaret Rau also contradicts Dwyer’s evidence in
several particulars. In it she deposes that the deceased was looking for a
fight and was the aggressive party but that she did not see the actual
shooting. Her name was on the back of the indictment as a witness but she was
not called by the Crown. She had been called at the preliminary hearing by the
defence. Counsel swore in his affidavit that he had endeavoured to locate her
during the trial but was unable to find her. He did not, however, ask for the
assistance of the court in finding her nor did he indicate to the court that he
wished to call her. Counsel at trial, on February 11, 1974, had been counsel
for the appellant at his preliminary hearing on December 10, 1973, and had
presumably received his instructions well before that date and had had
sufficient time to prepare for the defence. I am not of the opinion that the
Court of Appeal made any error in the exercise of its discretion under s. 610 
of the Criminal Code  and I would not give effect to this ground of
appeal.

The evidence sought to be introduced in this
motion does not meet the requirements established by this court in such
authorities as McMartin v. The Queen[4].

The appellant argues that the defence of
provocation was improperly dealt with by the trial judge in his direction to
the jury and by the majority of the Court of Appeal. This ground of appeal was
expressed in the appellant’s factum in these words:

Did the majority for the Court of Appeal
for the Province of Ontario err in

(1) finding that the failure of the learned
trial judge to instruct the jury that they should take into consideration the
evidence of the appellant’s intoxication in assessing whether he acted on the
sudden

[Page 1022]

and as a result of provocation was not a
miscarriage of justice?

It will be recalled that the appellant did not
raise the defence of provocation at trial but relied on self-defence. It may be
observed here that at no time did the appellant say that he had been provoked
into violent action by the words and conduct of the deceased. In fact, his
description of events goes far to negate any suggestion of provocation. His
evidence reveals an attack, described clearly and with some detail, to which he
reacted, not on the sudden, but by defending himself. When, according to his
evidence, he saw the deceased put his hand inside his sweater, he considered
that the deceased was reaching for a gun and, in fear of his life, he shot and
killed him. This describes a calculated and rational series of defensive acts,
not a sudden reaction in the heat of passion. Nevertheless, the trial judge and
the Court of Appeal considered there was some evidence of provocation which
required the putting of that charge to the jury. I have read the evidence with
care and find it difficult to reach a conclusion that there was any evidence of
a wrongful act or insult of such nature as to be sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control. Further, I was unable to find any
evidence that the accused acted on the sudden before his passion cooled.
However, since the direction was put, it should have been put correctly. Martin
J.A., for the majority of the Court of Appeal, after making some minor
criticisms of the charge on this point, said:

The failure of the trial judge, however, to
instruct the jury that they were entitled to consider the appellant’s condition
with respect to intoxication on the issue whether he was deprived of his power
of self-control, in the event they considered that there was a wrongful act or
insult sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control,
constituted non-direction and it, therefore, becomes necessary to examine this
error in the context of the trial to determine whether it resulted in a substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice.

Wilson J.A., while agreeing that there was error
in the charge on this point, disagreed with the majority conclusion that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice resulted. The majority’s

[Page 1023]

finding on this point was the basis of the
appellant’s attack.

It is clear that where the defence of
provocation is put to the jury in circumstances where there is evidence of
intoxication by drugs or alcohol of the defendant, the jury must be directed
that they are entitled to consider and should consider what effect such
intoxication, if they find it to exist, might have upon the accused. They
should be told to consider whether his power of self-control had been affected
to the point where he might be deprived, in whole or in part, of his normal
ability to restrain himself in circumstances which could amount to provocation.
Failure to charge upon this issue is misdirection and has been so regarded in
such cases as R. v. Harms[5] and
Taylor v. The King[6]. The
point is well summarized by Martin J.A. in R. v. Haight[7], at p. 173:

The Supreme Court of Canada in Taylor v. The King (1947), 89 C.C.C. 209,
[1948] 1 D.L.R. 545, [1947] S.C.R. 462, held that on a charge of murder
where the defence of provocation is advanced, intoxication may be considered by
the jury in the second branch of the inquiry, that is, whether the accused was
actually deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he had
received. I refer particularly to the judgment of Kellock, J. (with whom
Taschereau, J., concurred), at pp. 223-5, and the judgment of Estey, J., at p.
229. That case has been frequently applied by provincial appellate Courts. I
refer only to some of those cases: R. v. Ouellette (1950), 98 C.C.C.
153, 10 C.R. 397, [1950] 2 W.W.R. 875; R. v. Swanson (1950), 96 C.C.C.
227, 10 C.R. 81, [1950] 1 W.W.R. 1001; and Abel v. The Queen (1955), 115
C.C.C. 119, 23 C.R. 163, [1956] Que. Q.B. 89, and more recently by this Court
in R. v. Tennant and Nacaratto (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 80, 7 0.R. (2d)
687, 31 C.R.N.S. 1.

Defence counsel requested the trial Judge
to charge the jury in accordance with the principles enunciated in Taylor v. The King, supra. The application by defence counsel was vigorously opposed by Crown
counsel (who I hasten to add was not Mr. Watt), and as a result the trial
Judge did not instruct the jury that in deciding whether the accused was
actually deprived of his power of self-control, they should take into
consideration the

[Page 1024]

amount of liquor that he had consumed. We
are all of the view that he erred in failing to direct the jury in accordance
with the request that was made to him.

The trial judge was then in error in this
respect and it must be considered whether the Court of Appeal was correct in
applying the provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  to
dismiss the appeal on the basis that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred.

I am in agreement with the majority of the Court
of Appeal in their application of that section. In this case, there was little
if any evidence to support the proposition that provocation had been given.
There was no evidence from the appellant himself that he had been provoked and
no assertion from him that he had responded on the sudden before his passion
cooled. In fact, the evidence on this point revealed a lapse of time of four or
five minutes from the time of the alleged insult to the firing of the first
shot. He said he acted in self-defence. The evidence is all against
provocation. Furthermore, as pointed out by Martin J.A., any evidence which
could have supported the defence of provocation was bound up so closely with
his evidence of the assault against him that when it was rejected by the jury,
as it clearly was, there was no remaining basis for the defence of provocation.
As I have indicated, I doubt that the appellant was entitled to have the issue
of provocation go to the jury in this case. However, the direction in respect
of this defence given by the trial judge did not have an adverse effect upon
the appellant’s position. The omission by the trial judge to deal with the
evidence of intoxication is, in my opinion, not fatal to the conviction. In
applying the test in Colpitis v. The Queen[8], I am of the opinion that the result
would not have been affected by reference to the evidence of the appellant’s
intoxication. This ground of appeal must fail.

I come now to the argument that both Baylis and
Dwyer, as accessories after the fact, were accomplices and that the jury should
have been instructed on the danger of convicting on their evidence in the
absence of corroboration. As men-

[Page 1025]

tioned by Martin J.A., there was an abundance of
evidence that Baylis was an accomplice as an accessory after the fact in that
he assisted the appellant in the attempted disposal and concealment of the body
and provided food, clothing and shelter for the appellant after the event.
Counsel for the Crown conceded in the Court of Appeal that this issue, at least
with respect to Baylis, should have been left to the jury. The evidence with
respect to Dwyer was by no means as clear and I doubt if there was any which
could fairly be said to support the proposition that she was an accomplice as
an accessory after the fact. She was in no way connected with the killing and
the only evidence which could support a conclusion that she was an accessory
after the fact related to her cleaning up the blood stains after the body had
been removed from the premises. However, for the purpose of resolving this
point, I am prepared to assume that there was some evidence in her case which
could have gone to the jury on this issue. Nevertheless, even on that
assumption, I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice resulted because of the omission of
any such direction. As far as Baylis is concerned, his evidence did not go to
the actual killing. If he had never been called, or if the jury had disbelieved
every word he said, it would not affect the weight of the Crown evidence as to
the actual killing. As to events which occurred after the killing, of which he
did give evidence, his evidence dealt only with the disposal and concealment of
the body and with other peripheral matters which were not denied by the defence
and which added little or nothing to the Crown’s case. The omission of the
charge in respect of Baylis would not have affected the outcome of the case. As
to the witness Dwyer, her evidence was of vital concern to the Crown’s case but
her involvement as an accessory was tenuous and not connected with her evidence
of the killing.

I agree with Martin J.A. when he said in this
connection:

I am completely satisfied that any defect
in the judge’s charge because of his failure to leave with the jury the issue
whether Miss Dwyer was an accomplice was not a substantial wrong to the accused
and did not result in a miscarriage of justice.

[Page 1026]

This ground of appeal must also fail.

I now turn to the final ground of appeal. The
appellant alleges that the trial judge erred in dealing with the request of the
jury to have some evidence read back after they had commenced deliberation and,
that the Court of Appeal erred in considering that the trial judge’s handling
of this matter did not result in any substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice. The problem arose in this way. The jury retired to consider its
verdict at 1:22 p.m. After hearing counsel regarding certain objections to the
charge, the jury was called back at 1:58 p.m. and the trial judge gave
them further instructions to which no objection is taken here. The jury then
retired for a second time at 2:00 p.m. At 3:02 p.m., the jury returned to the
courtroom and upon that occasion the following occurred: 

HIS LORDSHIP: Gentlemen?

THE FOREMAN: Yes, my lord, we have a
question to rehear the testimony by the accused as well as Catherine Dwyer.

HIS LORDSHIP: What? All the evidence?

THE FOREMAN: The salient points.

HIS LORDSHIP: We do not want to retry it.
How much of her evidence do you want?

THE FOREMAN: The portion relating to Olbey’s
actions in the latter part of the evening, sir.

HIS LORDSHIP: You say the latter part of
the evening. Are you speaking of after 2:00 o’clock, or so?

THE FOREMAN: No, sir. I think from
approximately 12:30 on.

HIS LORDSHIP: 12:30. Do you want all of her
evidence from the time she returned when she said about 1:00 a.m.?

THE FOREMAN: Yes, sir.

HIS LORDSHIP: You want all of her evidence
read, examination and cross-examination, all of her evidence read?

THE FOREMAN: I think, sir, that in view of
the fact that there seems to be a bit of doubt—

HIS LORDSHIP: No. Just answer my question.
Do you want all of it read?

THE FOREMAN: Yes.

His LORDSHIP: I may say that not often is
the evidence read back to you; I am going to accede since one of the counsel
said that the evidence could be read back.

[Page 1027]

Normally, we do not have the evidence read
back and have the case retried, but we will.

Mr. Reporter, would you turn up the
evidence of Catherine Dwyer to the point where she said that she got to
Thornton’s house about 1:00 a.m.

The court reporter commenced reading back
evidence and stopped reading at 3:27 p.m. It is not clear from the transcript
itself why he stopped, but up to that point he had read back evidence filling
ten pages of the transcript which was reproduced before us.

The jury returned at 5:04 and required further
direction on the question of intoxication as it relates to homocide. In answer
to questions put to the trial judge, the foreman said the jury was not
concerned with provocation, merely intoxication. He asked the judge, “Just as
you read it from the law book”. The judge then charged the jury with respect to
drunkenness and the jury retired at 5:07. Neither counsel objected to this
charge. The jury returned at 5:18 and gave their verdict convicting the
appellant of murder.

Counsel for the appellant contended that the
trial judge was in error in allowing only part of the evidence of Dwyer to be
read back. He contended that when part of a witness’s evidence is reread all
the cross-examination or qualifying evidence should also be read so that the
evidence will be put in its proper relation to the whole of the case and so
that the evidence will not be isolated and given more emphasis and significance
than it should have.

I am in agreement with this proposition, as was
Martin J.A. in the Court of Appeal. He said:

I accept, of course, the proposition that
where the jury requests that the evidence of a witness be read back, it is
incumbent on the trial judge not to allow the jury to hear a part only of the
evidence of the witness without also hearing those portions of the evidence of
the witness, whether given in-chief or in cross-examination, which weaken or
qualify the part read, even though the jury indicates that it does not wish to
hear any more of the witness’ evidence. Otherwise, the jury is not hearing

[Page 1028]

the evidence of the witness, but only an
incomplete, or even an inaccurate account of his or her testimony.

This view is well supported in the authorities:
see R. v. Wydryk and Wilkie[9], R.
v. Bell Christiansen, Coolen and MacDonald[10],
R. v. Stewart and Johnson[11], R.
v. Smith, Sauvé and George[12].

It is necessary to examine what occurred in this
case. The transcript does not make clear why the reading back of the evidence
of Dwyer ceased. By agreement, an affidavit dated February 14, 1977, of
one Terrance Corcoran, who was the Supreme Court reporter involved in the
trial, was produced. Counsel for the appellant was allowed to cross-examine on
the affidavit and counsel for the Crown re-examined. The affidavit is
reproduced hereunder:

AFFIDAVIT

I Terrance Corcoran, a duly qualified
Supreme Court Reporter, make oath and say as follows:

1. That I was the Official Court Reporter
during the trial of the matter before the Honourable Mr. Justice Callon in
Windsor, Ontario in February of 1974;

2. That on Monday, the 14th day of
February, 1977, I was asked by the Crown Attorney to refer to my original notes
in the matter;

3. That I was asked in particular to refer
to any notes I might have as to what occurred when the jury returned to the
Courtroom and requested that certain evidence be read back to them;

4. That I complied with this request and
found that my notes indicated that after I had re-read to the jury the portion
of the examination-in-chief of the Crown witness C. Dwyer as it appears in Vol.
6 at pages 1192 to 1202 of the Transcript, the jury foreman indicated that the
jury did not wish to hear any more, and that it was not necessary to have the
remainder of the witness C. Dwyer’s evidence, nor the evidence of the Appellant
read back to them;

5. That after this indication was given by
the jury foreman, no further evidence was re-read to them;

6. And that this indication by the jury was
inadvertently omitted from the original transcript. The remark did not in fact
get transcribed as I was in the witness box reading the evidence at the time
the remarks were made.

[Page 1029]

DATED at Toronto, this 14th day of
February, 1977.

SWORN before me in the Judicial District of
York in the Regional Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto on this 14th day of
February, 1977.

(sgd.)
Terrance M. Corcoran

(sgd.) Doherty—A Commissioner, etc.

The cross-examination did not affect the
affidavit and it is evident that the jury, having heard part of the evidence
reread, were satisfied with what they had heard and did not feel the need for
further reading. The jury, in the result, had reread to them only a portion of
the evidence of Dwyer consisting of part of her examination in-chief by Crown
counsel. They did not request more. No cross-examination on this evidence was
reread and no qualifying evidence from Dwyer or other witnesses was read. What
was read was, from the Crown point of view, vital. It concerned Dwyer’s
description of the killing and forms the heart of the Crown’s case.

There can be no doubt that the trial judge was
in error in this matter. It would have been a relatively small matter to have
the cross-examination of Dwyer on this part of her testimony read back.
Furthermore, it would have been a simple matter to have read back Olbey’s
description of the killing or at least to have reminded the jury and recalled
to their minds its essential features. It must, therefore, be considered if
this error prejudiced the appellant by improperly influencing the jury’s
verdict, thereby resulting in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

To begin with, there was never any question as
to the fact that the appellant did the killing. The only question raised was as
to the nature of the killing. That is, did the appellant kill in self-defence
or, as later left by the trial judge to the jury, under provocation? Any
emphasis on Dwyer’s evidence merely identifying the appellant as the killer
could not, therefore, prejudice him. Her description of events excluded
self-defence and was indeed vital to the Crown’s case but I agree with Martin
J.A. that in cross-examination her evidence was not shaken. Furthermore, the
reading back of her cross-examination would, in

[Page 1030]

many respects have merely been a reiteration of
her description of the killing and I cannot think that this would have advanced
the appellant’s cause. Furthermore, the defence of self‑defence had been
fairly put to the jury by the trial judge. They had been warned that they
should consider the whole case and that if the evidence of the appellant raised
a doubt in their minds they should acquit. Considering the whole of the
evidence, the nature of the killing, and all the surrounding circumstances,
including the significant fact that the jury did not wish to hear further
testimony—the question which had arisen in their minds having been apparently
answered—it is my opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
resulted from the error of the trial judge in this respect.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Jury trial—Bodily harm with
intent to wound—Possession of a weapon, an automobile jack—Included
offence—Poll of jury—Response of juror—Ambiguity of response—Whether proper
course followed by judge—Unanimous verdict finally given.

Appellant indicted on two counts—of causing
bodily harm with intent to wound and of having possession of a weapon, namely
an automobile jack, for a purpose dangerous to the public peace—was tried
before a jury. On count 1 he was found not guilty but guilty of the included
offence of assault causing bodily harm. He was found guilty on count 2. His
appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed without written reasons.

Appellant’s grounds of appeal are based on what
transpired when the jury was polled after rendering the verdict of guilty. As
to count 1, the third juror polled began her response “Not guilty of 1…” The
Court then attempted to clarify the question being asked of her. She then
reiterated “Not guilty to the first one. Somebody can explain.” After a further
brief dialogue the jury retired while the judge heard submissions from counsel.
Thereafter the jury returned and the judge spoke to the juror in question; the
jury again retired and later returned with a unanimous verdict. Appellant’s
case was in essence that the trial judge acted improperly in following the
course adopted after the poll, at which point it was questionable whether the
verdict given by the foreman was in fact unanimous.

Held (Dickson and
Estey JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and Mclntyre JJ.: The duty of the trial judge in such a
situation is that he should carefully assure himself that there is no
misapprehension on the part of the jury as to the effect of their verdict and
that they concur in the decision. In

[Page 870]

order to succeed on the present appeal
appellant must show that the trial judge failed in that duty. The judge here
took steps to satisfy himself, in asking the jury to retire, then hearing the
submissions by counsel, and by enquiring of the juror as to her understanding
of the matter and receiving the answer that she understood. There was no error
of law on the part of the trial judge. The juror’s answers though convoluted
were adequate to show that she appreciated the difference between count 1 and
the included offence but had difficulty in explaining. The trial judge saw and
heard the juror and exercised his discretion.

The further ground raised, that the recharge of
the trial judge on the question of a unanimous verdict could have caused a
juror reasonably to conclude that a jury did not have a right to disagree was
not justified. Considered in context the reinstruction was no more than a
request that the jury again consider the issue as to whether or not they were
indeed unanimous, and whether the verdict was a true one.

Finally, there was no error on the part of
the judge in failing to have the jury polled on count 2. Such polling is not a
legal requirement. A request to poll is usually allowed where doubt as to
unanimity appears to exist. At the request of counsel the jury was polled on
count 1 but no request was made as to count 2 and there was no indication that
the juror was in doubt as to her verdict on that count.

Per Dickson
and Estey JJ., dissenting: The only issue is whether or not on the
record as revealed in the transcript the appellant was indeed found guilty by a
court composed of a judge and a jury which was properly charged and delivered
its unanimous verdict according to law. The difficulty arises in the juror’s
initial response. She said the accused was not guilty to “the first one”;
presumably the first charge. What was not clear was whether the juror meant not
guilty to the charge and any lesser included offences or to the charge only.
There was further ambiguity in her second response, i.e., whether or not
her reference to “the second” referred to the second charge or to a lesser
included offence in the first charge. Further, comments by counsel indicated a
common impression by both counsel that the juror did not understand the first
charge and any lesser included offences. Notwithstanding this state of affairs
as revealed on the record as between counsel and Court and juror and Court the
judge proceeded to address the jurors not as to the charges concerning which
juror had revealed at least

[Page 871]

some misunderstanding but rather on the need
for a unanimous verdict. It was for the appellate tribunal to determine if the
circumstances revealed by the record demanded that the presiding justice
reinstruct the jury on those points of law which seemed to be raised by the
juror and on any pertinent segments of the evidence. In this case it seems that
the judge did not adequately respond to the needs of the juror and there should
therefore be a new trial.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing without
written reasons an appeal from convictions of assault causing bodily harm and
of possession of a weapon dangerous to the public peace. Appeal dismissed,
Dickson and Estey JJ. dissenting.

A.Z. Kerekes, for the appellant.

W.J. Blacklock, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and Mclntyre JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The appellant was indicted on two
counts, that he:

1. …at the City of Windsor in the County of
Essex, on or about the 22nd day of August, 1975, with intent to wound Brian
Maskery did cause bodily harm to the said Brian Maskery, contrary to the Criminal
Code  of Canada;

2. …at the City of Windsor in the County of
Essex, on or about the 22nd day of August, 1975, did have in his possession a
weapon, to wit: an automobile jack, for a purpose dangerous to the public
peace, contrary to the Criminal Code  of Canada.

He was tried before a jury. On count 1, he was
found not guilty of the offence charged, but guilty of the included offence of
assault causing bodily harm. He was found guilty oil count 2.

His appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed
without written reasons. He appeals, with leave, to this Court.

[Page 872]

The appellant’s grounds of appeal are based upon
what transpired when the jury was polled after the verdict of guilty had been
rendered. I quote the relevant portions of the transcript:

THE CLERK: The jurors are all present Your
Honour. Members of the jury have you agreed upon your verdict.
Mr. Foreman, do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty as
charged. Count No. 1.

THE FOREMAN: Not guilty as charged, but
guilty of the included offence of assault causing bodily harm.

THE CLERK: And count No. 2.

THE FOREMAN: Guilty as charged.

THE CLERK: Members of the jury harken to
your verdict as the court hath recorded it. You say the prisoner at the bar is
not guilty as charged on Count No. 1, but guilty of assault causing bodily harm
and guilty as charged on count No. 2. So say you all?

THE JURY: Yes.

THE COURT: Mr. Cottrell would you like
the jury to be polled.

MR. COTTRELL: I would like to poll the
jury Your Honour.

THE CLERK: Members of the jury as I call
your name, would you answer guilty of assault causing bodily harm on count No.
1 or not guilty if your verdict be not guilty.

1ST JUROR—Guilty of assault causing bodily
harm.

2ND JUROR—Guilty of assault causing bodily
harm.

3RD JUROR—Not Guilty of 1—

THE COURT: Mrs. Sfalcin, you are being
asked if on the first count in the indictment you found the accused not guilty
of the original count, but guilty of the included offence of assault causing
bodily harm.

3RD JUROR—Not Guilty to the first one.
Somebody can explain.

MR. COTTRELL: With respect Your Honour
really, perhaps this particular juror may have had some difficulty
understanding.

3RD JUROR—I can understand for the second,
not the first one.

THE COURT: Mrs. Sfalcin, would you
stand please.

[Page 873]

(Juror stands)

THE COURT: Did you understand the evidence
Mrs. Sfalcin?

3RD JUROR—I understand, but when they said,
not the first thing, really try to do something, guilty not, but just to scare
the man, in the second line of the No. 2 and the Bl say not—

THE COURT: Did you understand, did you
understand the different verdicts that I read out for the jury?

3RD JUROR—Yes. Is not the first one really
try to do something but the second try to scare the—(interposing)

THE COURT: Ladies and Gentlemen, I am going
to ask you to retire to the jury room for a few minutes.

NOTE: Jury retires to the jury room.

The trial judge then heard submissions from
counsel, which included the following:

MR. COTTRELL: With respect Your
Honour, not intending any disrespect for that particular juror, but it appears
from the conversation we had up to this point, she doesn’t understand. What she
said, she called it A and B and has a difficulty of explaining it. I think
there is a serious doubt whether she understood the evidence, obviously she is
having—again with no disrespect to her, she is having difficulty explaining her
position.

THE COURT: She is having difficulty in
expressing herself no question about that. I am very concerned about her, if
she fully understood the evidence as it was stated, and fully understood the
distinction between the original charge and the included offence.

Following the completion of the submissions by
counsel, the jury returned and the judge spoke to Mrs. Sfalcin and to the
jury, as follows:

THE COURT: Mrs. Sfalcin, I am just
going to ask you one question, I don’t want to get into any discussion with
you. I just want you to answer the question that I will ask. Did you understand
clearly, the evidence that was given in this trial?

THE JUROR: Yes.

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, as I explained to you at the outset, it is necessary that this verdict be
unanimous. I want to make it clear that everyone has agreed on the verdict that
you will render to insure that there is a true verdict. I am going to ask you
to bear with me, and to retire to the jury room for another fifteen minutes, at
which time if you feel that

[Page 874]

there is a complete unanimity amongst you,
with reference to the verdict, you will come back and render the verdict again.

A further submission was made by counsel for the
accused at the end of which the judge said:

. It is my view that the situation that
confronts this court is that I am not satisfied that the verdict of the jury is
unanimous, as I feel that I am entitled to require the jury to return to the
jury room to consider the question that is before them, and to arrive at a
unanimous verdict, if that is possible, and that is what I intend.

The jury returned later and the transcript
reads:

THE CLERK: Members of the jury have you
agreed upon your verdict. Mr. Foreman, do you find the prisoner at the bar
guilty or not guilty as charged on count No. 1.

THE FOREMAN: We find, not guilty as
charged, but guilty of the included offence of assault causing bodily harm, and
count No. 2 guilty as charged. And it is unanimous.

THE COURT: Mr. Cottrell, do you wish
to have the jury polled.

MR. COTTRELL: Yes Your Honour.

THE CLERK: Members of the jury, as I call
your name would you please answer guilty if your verdict be guilty, or not
guilty as charged but guilty of assault causing bodily harm or not guilty.

ALL THE JURORS SAID: Not guilty as charged,
but guilty of an offence assault causing bodily harm.

THE COURT: Ladies and Gentlemen of the
Jury, I wish to thank you for the kind attention you have paid to the evidence
in this case. I must say that on the evidence as I have heard it, I do agree
with your verdict that you have arrived at. Thank you again for taking part in
the administration of justice in the country. You are free to retire.

The appellant has raised a number of grounds but
the principal ones are, in essence, that the trial judge acted improperly in
following the course which he adopted after the difficulty arose in respect of
the answer made by Mrs. Sfalcin, hereinafter referred to as “the juror”,
to the Clerk when the jury was polled. At that point it was questionable
whether the verdict of guilty in

[Page 875]

respect of the offence of assault causing bodily
harm, which had been delivered by the foreman, was, in fact, unanimous.

The duty of the trial judge in such a situation
was stated many years ago by Chief Justice Macaulay in R. v. Ford[1], at p. 217:

That a jury may correct their verdict, or
that any of them may withhold assent and express dissent therefrom at any time
before it is finally entered and confirmed, is clear from numerous authorities;
and the judge presiding over a criminal court cannot be too cautious in being
assured that, when a result so serious to the party accused as a verdict of
guilty is arrived at, all the jury understand the effect and concur in the
decision; and if at any moment, before it is too late, anything occurs to
excite suspicion on this subject, he should carefully assure himself that there
is no misapprehension in the matter.

The task of the trial judge is stated in this
passage as being that he should carefully assure himself that there is no
misapprehension in the matter. This statement was adopted by McFarlane, J.A.,
in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in R. v. Bryan[2],
at p. 344.

That case involved an appeal by the Crown
following an acquittal on a charge of indecent assault. When asked by the Clerk
if the jury had arrived at a verdict, the foreman stated that they had and that
the verdict was not guilty. The Clerk then asked if that was the verdict of all
of them, and to rise to indicate that they were unanimous. A member of the jury
stated “I’m not”, but then arose with the rest of the jurors. The trial judge
held that the verdict had been given. The Crown appealed on the basis that the
trial judge had erred in holding that a verdict had been given when one juror
had stated that she was not in agreement with the verdict. The appeal was dismissed.

McFarlane, J.A., after referring to the
statement in the Ford case, went on to say that there are no rules to
bind the judge as to how he should

[Page 876]

assure himself that there is no misapprehension
in the matter. In that case it was pointed out that the jury could have been
polled, but that procedure was not required by law. McFarlane, J.A.,
continued as follows, at pp. 344-45:

I think that in order to succeed on this
appeal the Crown must satisfy this Court that the learned trial judge failed to
so assure himself. I find no assistance in determining this question from the
report made to this Court under Code, s. 588 [am. 1960-61, c. 44,
s. 10; 1968-69, c. 38, s. 58] in which the learned trial Judge says that
he accepted the verdict:

…but upon reflection, I feel that I ought
not to have done so: it would have been better, probably, to have sent the jury
back for further deliberation.

The fact that on reflection the Judge feels
another course might probably have been better does not show that in accepting
the verdict, as he did, he had failed at the time to be satisfied in his own
mind that the doubt about unanimity was resolved. It may be significant that
the verdict was rendered on February 13, 1969, and that the learned Judge’s
report is dated March 11, 1970.

Counsel for the respondent has pointed out,
quite properly, that Crown counsel at the trial remained silent and did not
suggest a poll or any other procedure. In my view, this conduct of Crown
counsel is not conclusive, but it does indicate to me that counsel too was of
the opinion that the jurywoman who said “I’m not” had, by standing with the
other jurors and by her demeanour given her assent to the verdict of acquittal.
It is impossible to rely on speculation as to her gestures and facial expression
after she had risen and was standing with the other jurors. These were observed
by the learned trial Judge and are not disclosed by the written record.

The learned Judge’s remark, “Well, I’m
afraid the verdict has been given” is important. It was made after some
interval of time. I do not know how long or how short. The words, “I’m afraid”
are equivocal. I do not think I should infer from them that there remained a
doubt in the Judge’s mind that the verdict was unanimous, especially as they
are followed immediately by the unequivocal statement “the verdict has been
given”.

The matter is not entirely free from doubt,
but on the whole, I am not persuaded the Judge failed to assure himself that
the doubt raised by the jurywoman’s remark was not really removed by her
subsequent conduct. On that view the appeal of the Crown should be dismissed.

[Page 877]

In order to succeed on the present appeal, the
appellant must show that the trial judge failed to assure himself that there
was no misapprehension in the matter. In the present case, unlike the Bryan case,
the trial judge did take steps in order to satisfy himself. He asked the jury
to retire and then heard submissions by counsel. Before the jury retired he had
received the juror’s statement, in answer to his question, that she understood
the evidence.

Near the beginning of the discussion with
counsel, the judge stated that the juror had difficulty in expressing herself
and that he was concerned as to whether she understood the evidence and fully
understood the distinction between the original charge and the included
offence. He proceeded to hear the submissions of both counsel. Counsel for the
appellant contended that the juror did not comprehend the charges and that she
had difficulty in understanding the evidence.

The Court then rose and the trial judge had an
opportunity to consider the situation. That situation was that he had clearly
told the jury in his charge that if the Crown had not proved to their
satisfaction the element of intent to wound, or if they had a reasonable doubt
on that point, they must consider whether the appellant had committed an
assault causing bodily harm. He clearly defined that offence. The jury had
returned a verdict of guilty of that offence, but the juror’s answer on the poll
raised a question as to her concurrence in that verdict.

The jury was recalled. The juror was asked again
whether she clearly understood the evidence and she answered “yes”. He then
instructed the jury that everyone had to agree if there was to be a true
verdict. The jury retired. Counsel for the appellant made further submissions.
The judge then said:

It is my view that the situation that
confronts this court is that I am not satisfied that the verdict of the jury is
unanimous, as I feel that I am entitled to require the jury to retire to the
jury room to consider the question that is before them, and to arrive at a
unanimous verdict, if that is possible, and that is what I intend.

[Page 878]

The jury returned later with a verdict of guilty
of the included offence of assault causing bodily harm. They also found the
accused guilty on Count 2. The jury was polled on the finding in relation to
Count 1 and confirmed the verdict.

In my opinion there was no error of law on the
part of the trial judge in adopting the course of procedure which he followed.
He took the steps which, in his discretion, he deemed necessary to assure
himself that the jury was rendering a unanimous verdict of guilt in respect of
the included offence. After considering the submissions of counsel, he decided
that it was not necessary to recharge the jury regarding the included offence.
This was his decision to make. The jury had already been properly charged on
that issue. The juror’s answers, though convoluted, did show that she appreciated
the difference between the offence charged in Count 1 and the included offence,
but had difficulty in explaining.

Not guilty to the first one. Somebody can
explain.

Is not the first one really try to do
something but the second try to scare.

To me this discloses that she did not find the
appellant guilty of Count 1, as charged, but did not clearly indicate a finding
of guilt of the included offence although she attempted to distinguish it from
the first Count.

The trial judge saw and heard the juror and
could reach a conclusion as to the necessity for a recharge on the law to the
whole jury. After careful thought he exercised his discretion. In making the
decision which he did, I do not find any error in law on his part.

This was the unanimous view of the Court of
Appeal.

Another ground of appeal raised on behalf of the
appellant is that the recharge of the trial judge on the question of a
unanimous verdict could have caused a juror reasonably to conclude that the
jury did not have a right to disagree.

In my opinion the trial judge’s recharge as to
unanimity cannot be said to have that effect.

[Page 879]

Considered in the context of the events which
led up to this recharge, and in light of the trial judge’s comments in his
initial charge, the re-instruction can be seen as no more than a request that
the jury again consider the issue as to whether or not they were unanimous in
their verdict in order to ensure that the verdict rendered was a true verdict
in accordance with their duty as jurors. The trial judge had already made it
clear to the jury, in his initial comments to them, that they had the right to
disagree.

It was further contended that there was error in
law on the part of the trial judge in failing to have the jury polled with
respect to Count 2. The polling of the jury after rendering its verdict is not
a legal requirement (R. v. Recalla[3]).
A request to poll is usually allowed where doubt as to unanimity appears to
exist. At the request of counsel for the appellant the jury was polled as to
Count 1. No additional request was made for a poll in respect of Count 2. There
was no indication that the juror was in doubt as to her verdict on Count 2.

For these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal
should be dismissed.

The reasons of Dickson and Estey JJ. were
delivered by

ESTEY J. (dissenting)—I have had the
opportunity of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Martland in this
appeal and for reasons which I will now set out I must respectfully come to a
different result. Martland J. has set out the principal portions of the
evidence dealing with the issue with which we are here concerned as well as the
charges upon which the appellant was tried and found guilty.

The only issue, of course, is whether or not on
the record as revealed in the transcript, the appellant has indeed been found
guilty by a court composed of a judge and a jury which was properly charged and
delivered its unanimous verdict according to law.

[Page 880]

The difficulty arose when, at the request of
defence counsel, the jury was polled. In the course of the polling of the third
juror, Mrs. Sfalcin, made the following responses:

3RD JUROR—Not Guilty of 1—

THE COURT: Mrs. Sfalcin, you are being
asked if on the first count in the indictment you found the accused not guilty
of the original count, but guilty of the included offence of assault causing
bodily harm.

3RD JUROR—Not Guilty to the first one.
Somebody can explain.

MR. COTTRELL: With respect Your Honour
really, perhaps this particular juror may have had some difficulty
understanding.

3RD JUROR—I can understand for the second,
not the first one.

THE COURT: Mrs. Sfalcin, would you
stand please.

(Juror stands)

THE COURT: Did you understand the evidence
Mrs. Sfalcin?

3RD JUROR—I understand, but when they said,
not the first thing, really try to do something, guilty not, but just to scare
the man, in the second line of the No. 2 and the Bl say not—

THE COURT: Did you understand, did you
understand the different verdicts that I read out for the jury?

3RD JUROR—Yes. Is not the first one really
try to do something but the second try to scare the—(interposing)

Following this exchange the jury was directed to
retire and a discussion ensued between Court and counsel. Upon the return of
the jury the following exchange took place:

THE COURT: Mrs. Sfalcin, I am just
going to ask you one question, I don’t want to get into any discussion with
you. I just want you to answer the question that I will ask. Did you understand
clearly, the evidence that was given in this trial?

THE JUROR: Yes.

We are therefore concerned with whether or
not the presiding justice responded according to the tenets of criminal law to
the comments or answers given by the third juror. The difficulty arises in the
juror’s initial response. First of all she said that the accused was not guilty
“to the first one”. Presumably this means the first

[Page 881]

charge but does not indicate whether the
juror means not guilty to the charge and any lesser included offences or the
charge only. She did twice state one way or another that the accused was not
guilty of the first one.

Her second response presumably dealt with
the second charge which she apparently professed to understand. In so stating,
however, she said in as many words that she could not understand the first
“one.” The ambiguity arising from this comment of course relates to whether or
not she refers to the second charge or a lesser included offence in the first
charge when she refers to “the second.” The problem becomes more serious when
one tries to discern a meaning from her final comments. The difficulty of
ascertaining the true meaning of the juror’s response was either caused or
greatly increased by the Clerk of the Court when, in addressing the jury on the
poll, he confined his question entirely to the first count. In the first
instance, the Clerk’s words to the jury were:

THE CLERK: Members of the jury as I call
your name, would you answer guilty of assault causing bodily harm on count No.
1 or not guilty if your verdict be not guilty.

On the second occasion the Clerk spoke as
follows:

THE CLERK: Members of the jury, as I call
your name would you please answer guilty if your verdict be guilty, or not
guilty as charged but guilty of assault causing bodily harm or not guilty.

ALL THE JURORS SAID: Not guilty as charged,
but guilty of an offence assault causing bodily harm.

Thus it appears that the jurors were never
polled on count no. 2.

It is interesting to note the response of both
Court and counsel to the unexpected response by juror no. 3 to the polling by
the Clerk. In the absence of the jury, the following discussion occurred:

MR. COTTRELL [counsel for the
accused]: With respect Your Honour, not intending any disrespect for that
particular juror, but it appears from the conversation we had up to this point,
she doesn’t understand. What she said, she called it A and B and has a
difficulty of explaining it. I think there is a serious doubt whether she
understood the evidence, obviously she is having—again with no disrespect to
her, she is having difficulty explaining her position.

[Page 882]

THE COURT: She is having difficulty in
expressing herself no question about that. I am very concerned about her, if
she fully understood the evidence as it was stated, and fully understood the
distinction between the original charge and the included offence. (underlining
added)

MR. COTTRELL: She indicated sir, I
believe, the first one meant to try and kill him and the second one was to
scare him. I believe she said that B meant to scare, that certainly is not
assault bodily harm, it is not an element of assault bodily harm. I think we
have to be concerned whether she understood the evidence, as she certainly does
not understand the charge itself on count one.

THE COURT: Mr. Hunter.

MR. HUNTER [counsel for the Crown]:
She stated quite clearly she understood the evidence. I think she stated quite
clearly, there is doubt in her mind that the accused is guilty of count No. 2.
I think she indicated that he was guilty of count No. 2.

THE COURT: Count No. 2 is not the included
offence.

MR. HUNTER: I understood her to say
that, she went along with count No. 2.

THE COURT: But we are concerned with count
No. 1. That was my understanding, she has not been asked about count No. 2.

MR. HUNTER: In that case it is a
question of whether he is not guilty of count No. 1 as charged, but guilty of
the included offence of count No. 1, or is she referring to count No. 2.

THE COURT: I don’t know what she is
referring to. (Underlining added.)

MR. HUNTER: Perhaps if we can go into
that a little more, she realises there is an included offence in count No. 1.

THE COURT: I don’t want to cross-examine
her in what she means, this is a difficulty obviously, since the jury has
returned, at least it must have been the impression amongst the other jurors,
that they have reached a unanimous verdict. It places the court in a difficult
position to start asking her questions.

MR. HUNTER: Well, Your Honour, when
the jury is brought back in, I would ask that perhaps you will explain the
included offence in count No. 1 again, and ask the jury to return again sir.

THE COURT: Thank you Mr. Hunter.
Mr. Cottrell.

MR. COTTRELL: With all respect to
Mr. Hunter, it appears that they have come to a verdict, and have come

[Page 883]

in and said not guilty of the main offence
in count No. 1, but guilty of assault causing bodily harm. They performed a
function, and on being polled, that particular juror has indicated to the
court, she said, not guilty of one, because that means to kill him, and No. 2
or B that means to scare him.

THE COURT: I didn’t hear her say that means
to kill him. I heard her say that means to scare him.

MR. COTTRELL: I believe she said Count
1, the main charge of wounding or to try and kill him, I would say that from
what she said before Your Honour, before you retired the jury the second time,
it appears she has no comprehension of the charges. Coupled with the fact again
with no dis-respect of that particular juror, she obviously has a difficulty in
communicating in the English language. There is also that substantial
possibility, she may have had difficulty understanding the evidence. I think
that is a reasonable problem before the court, giving that the conversation
that Your Honour has had with her a few minutes ago, I can’t say for sure—I
believe the reporter could verify that, when she first started to explain, I
believe she used the word to the effect not guilty, that means trying to kill
him, but guilty of either two or B, because that means just to scare him. That
might indicate she is saying not guilty completely of count 1, but guilty of
count 2.

The foregoing comments by counsel and like
comments as revealed on the record which were made after the discourse between
juror and Court indicate a common impression by both counsel that the juror did
not understand the first charge and any lesser included offences.
Notwithstanding this state of affairs as revealed by discussion between counsel
and the Court, and indeed between juror no. 3 and the Court, the learned trial
judge proceeded to address the jurors not with respect to the charges
concerning which the juror had obviously revealed at least some
misunderstanding, but rather on the need for a unanimous verdict.

It is the treatment by the trial judge of the
situation which arose from the foregoing interchanges which must determine
whether or not there has been in law a unanimous verdict of the jury on the
charges. In examining the record at trial in such circumstances, an appellate
tribunal must be constantly aware of the advantage enjoyed by the trial judge
in seeing the juror in question

[Page 884]

and in measuring his or her reaction to the
questions put by the Court. On the other hand, the right of the defendant to a
fair trial in every phase and aspect of the proceedings in the courtroom is
paramount, and however inadvertent a remark, observation or a direction may be,
if it is open to an inference which places the authenticity of the juror’s
determination in doubt, then the appellate tribunal may not, in my view, assume
that the mind of the juror has been unequivocally reflected in the juror’s
response to the poll.

There are numerous situations in which a juror’s
conduct may frustrate the attempt by the Court to obtain a clear and unanimous
verdict from the jury. For example, if a juror is found not to understand
English the verdict must be set aside. See Ras Behari Lal et al. v. The
King-Emperor[4]. A
somewhat similar circumstance arose in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Ellison (February 9, 1976, unreported), where a juror, upon being
polled, said “Guilty, Your Honour—but with some doubt”. In response to a
request by the trial judge as to whether the juror meant guilty or not guilty,
the juror replied “Guilty Your Honour”. The Court went on to record the verdict
of the jury as being “guilty”. The Court of Appeal directed a new trial being
of the opinion that the trial judge should not have accepted the verdict of the
jury in such a circumstance without further enquiries. Kelly J.A., speaking for
the Court, stated:

In some cases the matter may be resolved by
a simple enquiry from the trial Judge to the jury. It is not desirable,
however, that the trial Judge should enter into dialogue with the members of
the jury. It is preferable that the trial Judge re-instruct the jury on those
points upon which he has reason to believe there may have been misunderstanding
of his earlier instruction and send the jury back to reconsider the evidence in
the light of the re-instruction.

It is apparent that one alternative source of
confusion in the mind of the juror was the relationship to the first count and
charges included therein. The unsettled state of her mind as revealed by her
comments in the course of the polling operation called for the presiding
justice, in my view, to

[Page 885]

re-instruct the jury in the manner suggested in
the Ellison case, supra. The learned trial judge on the other
hand proceeded to refresh the memory of the jurors on the need to be unanimous
in their verdict. I find nothing in the juror’s comments, however, which would
indicate any confusion on the subject of the need for unanimity. Indeed,
Mrs. Sfalcin, in her comments, indicates quite the contrary in one
possible interpretation, i.e., that there is not unanimity in at least one
phase of one count of the charges. It may well be that a jury reporting its decision
in a civil tribunal might, under similar circumstances, be able to retire and
come in with a verdict beyond challenge. In the criminal arena where the
liberty of a subject is at stake, such latitude is not traditionally found in
the law. The tribunal in question consists of a court comprising the jury and
the presiding justice. The jury as the ultimate tribunal of fact must pronounce
its verdict precisely in the manner prescribed by law. Here there is a serious
question as to whether the jury has pronounced a unanimous verdict in respect
of each of the two charges. In such a circumstance, what is the role of the
appellate tribunal? As I have mentioned, the opportunity of the trial judge to
observe the demeanour of the juror is not given to the appellate tribunal.
Furthermore, of necessity, latitude must be given to the presiding justice in
the manner of communication with the jury. What is not, however, in my view,
open to the appellate tribunal is the right to speculate as to what the juror
intended when communicating his or her vote on the verdict when being polled.
At that stage I adopt the views expressed in the Ellison case, supra.
On principle, the appellate tribunal must determine whether or not the
circumstances as revealed by the record demanded that the presiding justice
re-instruct the jury on those points of law which seem to be raised by the
juror’s comments, and on any segments of the evidence which may be related
thereto. It is, of course, a function in the nature of a recharge normally
called for by counsel for prosecution or defence. In some circumstances no
doubt, the briefest re-assertion or repetition of the explanation given as to
the law applicable to the charges in question will suffice. In the
circumstances revealed by this record it is my view that the learned trial

judge did not adequately respond to the needs of
the juror as revealed by her comments and I therefore would direct a new trial.

[Page 886]

Having come to such a conclusion, it is not
necessary to deal at length with the challenge advanced by the appellant
concerning the recharge on the question of unanimity. If I were called upon to
do so, I would, with respect, adopt the comments of my brother Martland. The
duty incumbent upon the instructing judge when dealing with the necessity for
unanimity has been fully dealt with by this Court on earlier occasions (Hébert
v. The Queen[5];
Harrison v. The Queen[6] and
Latour v. The King[7]) and
to review these cases once again would add nothing to the law.

I am assisted in reaching this conclusion with
respect to the charge concerning unanimity by the fact that the learned trial
judge, in his initial charge, dealt with the subject fully, fairly and
accurately, and in his general observations anticipated the possibility of a
recharge and instructed the jury to consider the charge and any recharge as an
entire instruction, or in his words, to consider “the totality of the charge”.

Counsel for the appellant made reference to s.
573  of the Criminal Code  which makes provision for the discharge of a juror
for “illness or other reasonable cause”. This section is prefaced “Where
in the course of a trial…”. Here the difficulty arose after these proceedings
had come down to the last act, the recording of the jury’s verdict. The
appellant, however, did not go so far as to submit that difficulty in
communicating a verdict by a juror during a poll would amount to “reasonable
cause” for the discharge of a juror by a judge under the section. This Code provision
does not, in my view, provide the solution in these circumstances.

Finally, it is said by the appellants that the
reference by the learned trial judge in his final comments to the jury: “I am
going to ask you to bear with me and to retire to the jury room for

[Page 887]

another 15 minutes...” imposed a time element
upon the jury. Such a practice was condemned in R. v. McKenna[8] and in R. v. Davidson[9]. In the proceedings now before the
Court, however, the reference to time cannot reasonably be construed as
imposing a limit on any deliberations which the jury might wish then to
undertake. Rather, it was couched in terms of the overriding concern of the
trial judge with the issue of unanimity with which I have dealt. I would not,
if it were required in disposing of this appeal, come to any conclusion
different to my brother Martland with respect to this aspect of the appeal.

For the reasons set out above, I would therefore
allow the appeal, set aside the conviction entered at the trial court, and
direct a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Issue estoppel—Acquittal of
murder of robbery victim—Subsequent contradictory statement under
oath—Conviction of robbery—Conviction for making contradictory statements in
judicial proceedings—Criminal Code ss. 124, 302(c).

Appellant was acquitted on a charge of
non-capital murder of the victim of a robbery. Some four years thereafter,
appellant, while under investigation for other offences, made statements to the
police that he had attempted to steal from the murdered person and had shot him
when he resisted. Appellant was then charged with robbery and with perjury in
denying under oath at the murder trial that he had shot the victim. He pleaded
guilty to both charges but was discharged on the latter, the Provincial Judge
holding that the Crown could not relitigate the shooting in view of the
acquittal of murder. The Crown some six months later preferred an indictment
for perjury (contrary to s. 121) and for making contradictory statements in
judicial proceedings (contrary to s. 124). The main question in this appeal was
whether appellant might invoke issue estoppel in respect of the two charges of
which he was convicted, the s. 124 conviction and the robbery conviction.

Held: The
appeals should be dismissed.

Issue estoppel is part of the criminal law of
  Canada. The question before the Court is not therefore whether issue estoppel
is recognized but whether it has any application to the convictions here on the
relevant facts. The gist of the charge under s. 124 is making the contradictory
statement with intent to mislead the Court at the murder trial. Appellant is
not placed in double jeopardy because he cannot be retried for murder and it is
enough for him to rely in that respect on autrefois acquit. It was his
subsequent admission under oath that he lied at the trial that added a new
element and gave

[Page 799]

rise to a situation outside the ambit of the
trial for murder. While it was contended that the fact of the later contrary
admission could not give rise to a contradiction of a jury verdict, which must
be regarded as conclusively true, and therefore that the later admission could
not be “an intent to mislead the Court” there is here a question of policy.
Unless it can be said that the subsequent prosecution is an attempt by the
Crown to retry the accused, the preferable policy is to exclude issue estoppel
especially where the contradictory statements consist of admissions of the
accused himself. The charge of robbery and the conviction thereon raise related
but also different considerations. Reliance on issue estoppel should not be
foreclosed simply because appellant pleaded guilty. Robbery is not however an
included offence on a charge of murder and appellant was not put in jeopardy of
a conviction of robbery when he was tried for murder. The point argued here was
that, on any view of the facts, the killer and robber were one and the same
person and since appellant was acquitted of the killing he could not be guilty
of the robbery. The trial judge’s charge however left to the jury not only
whether the appellant himself killed while intending to rob but also whether he
was associated with another in a common intention to rob and whether in that
connection the other person did the killing in a situation that appellant knew
or should have known that the killing would be a probable consequence of the
robbery. It does not follow that appellant’s acquittal of murder necessarily
meant that he was not a party to the robbery. The possibility or even the
probability that the jury found in appellant’s favour is not enough. A finding
on the relevant issue must be the only rational explanation of the jury.

APPEALS from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1]
dismissing appeals from con-

[Page 800]

victions under ss. 124 and 302(c) of
the Criminal Code. Appeals dismissed.

Claude Thomson, Q.C, and Gavin MacKenzie,
for the appellant.

Edward Then and Miss Michael A.
MacDonald, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The main question in this
appeal, which is here by leave of this Court, is whether the appellant may
invoke issue estoppel in respect of two charges of which he was convicted,
namely, giving contradictory evidence in different judicial proceedings,
contrary to s. 124 of the Criminal Code, and robbery, contrary to s. 302(c)
of the Criminal Code. These charges and the convictions thereon followed
his acquittal on a charge of non-capital murder of the victim of the robbery,
one Morris Mayzel.

The appellant gave evidence at his trial for
murder and, being asked directly “Did you shoot Morris Mayzel?”, he answered,
“No, I did not”. The appellant was associated in a robbery scheme with one
Edward McDonald who testified for the Crown. Gushue’s evidence was that he did
not enter the victim’s tailor shop but rather that he withdrew from the scheme
and that it was McDonald who entered the tailor shop alone. McDonald testified
that it was he who withdrew and that Gushue had entered the tailor shop where
the proprietor was shot and killed. I am not concerned here to elaborate on the
evidence given at the trial for murder. I add merely that there was evidence
that after the killing, Gushue sold a revolver which, according to expert
evidence, was the murder weapon. Gushue maintained that he got it from McDonald
after the killing of Mayzel.

About four years after his acquittal, the
appelant accused, while under investigation for other offences, made statements
to the police that he had attempted to steal from Mayzel and had shot

[Page 801]

him when he resisted. A few months later Gushue pleaded
guilty to a charge of robbery of Mayzel. At the same time he was charged with
perjury in denying under oath at the murder trial that he had shot Mayzel. He
pleaded guilty to that charge as well, but the Provincial Judge after hearing
the facts, ordered that a plea of not guilty be entered and proceeded to hold a
preliminary inquiry at which Gushue testified on a voir dire as to the
admissibility of his statements to the police. When asked about the statements,
he said that the statements that he had shot Mayzel were true. The Provincial
Judge nonetheless discharged Gushue, holding that the Crown could not
relitigate the issue of the shooting in view of the acquittal of murder.

Six months later the Crown applied for and
obtained the consent of a County Court Judge to prefer an indictment against
Gushue for perjury, contrary to s. 121 of the Criminal Code and for
making contradictory statements in judicial proceedings contrary to s. 124. The
perjury charge was based on the accused’s evidence at the murder trial that he
did not shoot Mayzel. The charge of making contradictory statements in judicial
proceedings was based on Gushue’s denial at his murder trial that he had shot
Mayzel and his assertion on the voir dire at the subsequent preliminary
inquiry on the charge of perjury that his statements to the police that he shot
Mayzel were true.

At his trial on these charges before Graburn
County Court Judge and a jury, the judge directed the jury to acquit the
accused of perjury because, in view of the finding of the jury on the trial for
murder, a second jury would have to make a contrary finding and it was
precluded from doing so. The accused was, however, found guilty of the charge
under s. 124.

Appeals were launched by the Crown against the
acquittal of perjury and by the accused against his convictions of robbery on
his plea of guilty and against his conviction of the charge under s. 124.
Martin J.A., who spoke for a five-judge Court of

[Page 802]

Appeal, affirmed the convictions of the accused;
and, although of the opinion on the Crown’s appeal that the prior acquittal of
murder did not preclude conviction of perjury at that trial, and that a new
trial would therefore be in order, he concluded that in view of the conviction
under s. 124, a conviction of perjury would be contrary to the principle laid
down by this Court in Kienapple v. The Queen[2]. The appeal from the
acquittal of perjury was thereupon dismissed and that matter is not before this
Court.

As to the two convictions which are here, and
the assertion of the accused that they are properly met by issue estoppel, I
think it desirable to say at the outset that issue estoppel is part of the
criminal law of Canada, and I would affirm the position of this Court in the
matter, as expressed in McDonald v. The Queen[3] and Wright, McDermott and
Feeley v. The Queen[4].
The Court accepted the statement of law of the availability of issue estoppel
in criminal proceedings made by the Privy Council in Sambasivam v. Public
Prosecutor, Federation of Malaya[5].

There are thin but nonetheless discernible lines
between issue estoppel and inconsistent verdicts and double jeopardy. I prefer
to take Sealfon v. United States[6]
as involving a recognition of issue estoppel in the criminal law by the Supreme
Court of the United States, rather than as resting merely on double jeopardy,
that is on an attempt by the prosecution to re-try an accused of an offence of
which he had previously been acquitted. So too, there is recognition of issue
estoppel by the High Court of Australia in Mraz v. The Queen (No. 2)[7], even though it may be urged
that it rests on inconsistent verdicts. In so far as the House of Lords in the
recent case of Director of Public

[Page 803]

Prosecutions v. Humphrys[8] denied that issue estoppel
could be raised in criminal proceedings, it does not commend itself to me. I
prefer, as compatible with the view taken by this Court, the obiter acceptance
of issue estoppel in the earlier House of Lords’ judgment in Connelly v.
Director of Public Prosecutions[9].
I think it important to note, however, that on the assumed acceptance of issue
estoppel in criminal proceedings, the House of Lords in the Humphrys case
saw a prosecution for perjury as an exception on the policy ground that
although an accused cannot be re-tried for an offence of which he has been
acquitted, he is not to be permitted to escape the consequences of having
testified falsely at his trial.

The question before this Court is, therefore,
not whether issue estoppel is recognized in Canadian criminal law but whether, as
in the McDonald case and in the Wright, McDermott and Feeley case,
it has any application to the two convictions of the accused in this case on
the relevant facts. There is always, of course, an initial difficulty in giving
effect to a plea of issue estoppel where it is directed to the verdict of a
jury which consists either of a bare finding of guilty or one of not guilty.
How can it be ascertained on what issue or issues the finding rested for the
purpose of foreclosing a relitigation of that issue or those issues in a
subsequent criminal prosecution?

Counsel for the accused conceded that there
cannot be any scrutiny of the evidence to determine what issues were before the
jury. A surer guide may be found in the charge of the trial judge. There were,
however, several issues left to the jury and not only the issue whether Gushue
alone shot Mayzel in the course of a robbery. Martin J.A., in the Court of
Appeal, gave the following summary of the charge:

The judge who presided over the trial of
Gushue for the murder of Mayzel instructed the jury that if Gushue fired the
shot which killed Mayzel while committing the

[Page 804]

offence of robbery, he was guilty of murder
or, alternatively, he was guilty of murder if he and McDonald formed a common
intention to rob Mayzel and to assist each other in the robbery, and in
carrying out the common intention McDonald killed Mayzel and Gushue knew or
ought to have known that the killing of Mayzel would be a probable
consequence of the carrying out or attempting to carry out the proposed
robbery. I observe that this latter direction was more favourable to Gushue
than the direction to which by law he was entitled, as it was not necessary in
the circumstances in order to find him guilty of murder that the jury should
find that he knew or ought to have known that the killing of Mayzel was a
probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose to rob him.

If the jury followed the instruction which
they were given by the trial judge (as I think we must assume they did), they
may have acquitted Gushue either because:

(a) they found that he had withdrawn from
the plan to rob Mayzel, or entertained a reasonable doubt on the question, or

(b) although they were satisfied that
Gushue was a party to the robbery, they entertained a reasonable doubt whether
McDonald rather than Gushue, killed Mayzel, and whether Gushue knew or ought to
have known that the killing of Mayzel by McDonald was a probable consequence of
the common intention to commit robbery.

I draw particular attention to the misdirection
in favour of the accused, imposing as it did a larger burden on the Crown than
was warranted in law. Counsel for the accused invoked the Mraz case, supra,
and especially the judgment of Chief Justice Dixon, at p. 68, where that
learned judge said the following:

…It is nothing to the point that the
verdict may have been the result of a misdirection of the judge and that owing
to the misdirection the jury may have found the verdict without understanding
or intending what as a matter of law is its necessary meaning or its legal
consequences. The law which gives effect to issue estoppels is not concerned
with the correctness or incorrectness of the finding which amounts to an
estoppel, still less with the processes of reasoning by which the finding was
reached in fact; it does not matter that the finding may be thought to be due
to the jury having been put upon the wrong track by some direction of the
presiding judge or to the jury having got on the wrong track unaided. It is
enough that an issue or issues have been distinctly raised and found. Once that
is done, then, so

[Page 805]

long as the finding stands, if there be any
subsequent litigation between the same parties, no allegations legally
inconsistent with the finding may be made by one of them against the other. Res
judicata pro veritate accipitur… And, as has already been said, this
applies in pleas of the Crown.

It was the further contention of counsel for the
accused that the acquittal of murder was a positive determination that Gushue
did not kill Mayzel, that there was no evidence that Gushue was a party to a
killing by McDonald and, consequently, it was wrong to leave it to a second
jury on the charge under s. 124 to second guess the jury that acquitted him of
murder. It was submitted that if this was allowed, it would mean that a
collateral attack could be made on jury verdicts, that the policy of finality
of jury verdicts which are not appealed would be circumvented and that the
accused would lose the benefit of the presumption of innocence.

I do not think that these submissions are
telling in favour of the application of issue estoppel in respect of the charge
under s. 124. The gist of the charge under that provision is making the
contradictory statement with intent to mislead the Court, that is at the murder
trial. The accused is not placed in double jeopardy because he cannot be
retried for murder; indeed, it is enough for him to rely on autrefois
acquit. The surfacing of his subsequent admission under oath that he lied
at the trial for murder adds a new element and gives rise to a situation
outside of the ambit of the trial for murder. It was contended, however, that
the logic of the situation is in favour of the accused, that the jury finding
that the accused did not kill Mayzel must be regarded as conclusively true, and
the fact of the later contrary admission cannot give rise to a contradiction
and there could not, therefore, be an intent to mislead the Court.

Logical as this submission may appear to be,
what we have to resolve here is a question of policy based on the premise that
issue estoppel cannot be founded on false evidence where the falsity is
disclosed by subsequent evidence not available at the trial from which issue
estoppel is alleged to arise. In my view, unless it can be said that the

[Page 806]

subsequent prosecution is an attempt by the
Crown to re-try the accused—and that is not the case here—the preferable policy
is to exclude issue estoppel, especially when the contradictory statements on
which the charge under s. 124 is founded consist of admissions of the accused
himself.

In the result, I agree with Martin J.A. that the
conviction of the accused under s. 124 should be affirmed.

The charge of robbery and the conviction thereon
raise related but also different considerations. I would not in this case
foreclose reliance on issue estoppel simply because the accused pleaded guilty
to the charge of robbery. It must be noted, however, that robbery is not an
included offence on a charge of murder (see s. 589(3) of the Criminal Code),
and hence the accused, as Martin J.A. pointed out, was not put in jeopardy of a
conviction of robbery when he was tried for murder. What was urged by counsel
for the accused was that, on any view of the facts, the killer and robber of
Mayzel were one and the same person, and since the accused was acquitted of the
killing he could not be guilty of robbery. The accused’s evidence that he did
not enter the tailor shop must have been accepted by the jury, so it was
contended, in order to acquit him of the killing and, correlatively, this
excluded any possibility of his implication in the robbery.

However, the trial judge’s charge to the jury
left to them not only the issue whether the accused himself killed Mayzel while
intending to rob him. He also left to them the issue whether he was associated
with McDonald in a common intention to rob Mayzel and to assist each other in
carrying it out and whether in that connection McDonald killed Mayzel and
Gushue knew or ought to have known that the killing would be a probable
consequence of carrying out or attempting to carry out the robbery. Accepting
for present purposes that the misdirection on this point, to which I referred
earlier, is no bar to issue estoppel, it does not follow that the accused’s
acquittal of murder, which could have been by reason of the misdirec-

[Page 807]

tion, necessarily meant that he was not a party
to the robbery.

I am of opinion that the question of issue
estoppel in respect of the robbery conviction is put to rest by the following
statement, which I adopt, in Friedland, Double Jeopardy (1969), at
p.134:

... The possibility or even the probability
that the jury found in the accused’s favour on a particular issue is not
enough. A finding on the relevant issue must be the only rational explanation
of the verdict of the jury.

The point has already been made that the accused
could not have been convicted of robbery on his trial for murder. Moreover, it
is not the same conduct that is involved in the charge of robbery as in the
charge of murder under the alternative direction to the jury given by the trial
judge. In the circumstances, I do not think it is correct to say that the
accused was being subjected to a second prosecution for a different aspect of
the same conduct which was necessarily involved in his trial for murder. I
agree, therefore, with Martin J.A. that the contentions on behalf of the
accused in respect of the robbery conviction fail.

In the result, the appeals are dismissed.

Appeals dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Conspiracy to possess
counterfeit money—Evidence—Admissibility—Conversations recorded by consent of
one party—Proof of consent—Consenter not a witness—Criminal Code , ss. 178.1 ,
178.11(2) (a), 178.16(1) —Protection of Privacy Act, 1973‑74 (Can.), c. 50.

Evidence—Interception—Conversations
intercepted by consent—Direct conversation—Telephone
conversation—Admissibility—Voluntariness of consent—Proof of consent—Criminal
Code , ss. 178.1 , 178.11(2) (a), 178.16(1) —Protection of Privacy Act, 1973-74 (Can.), c. 50.

Appellant Goldman was acquitted on a charge
of conspiracy with one Cremascoli (now deceased), one Dwyer, and others
unknown, to possess counterfeit American money. The Crown case depended on the
admission in evidence of recordings made by police of two conversations on May
20, 1976 between Dwyer and appellant. The first was a telephone conversation
and the second a direct conversation during which Dwyer was fitted with a
concealed device and from which transmissions were recorded by the police who
were some distance away. Dwyer, arrested in the U.S., was found to be in possession of counterfeit U.S. money and to avoid serious punishment
agreed to assist the police. He was brought to Canada and gave a consent in writing to the interception of his
conversations with Goldman. After completing his part in the matter he returned
to the U.S. and has not since
been seen by agents of the Crown. Dwyer was not called as a witness at the
trial and after a lengthy voir dire the trial judge refused to admit the
evidence. The judge concluded that Dwyer had given bona fide consent to
the interception but also that the interceptions having been made without
judicial authority were not lawfully made within s. 178.16(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  and therefore, that since Dwyer’s consent did not include a consent to
the admission of evidence under s. 178.16(1) (b), the evi-

[Page 977]

dence was excluded. The Court of Appeal however
accepted the trial judge’s finding as to the nature of Dwyer’s consent, but
held that such consent made the interception lawful and that the evidence was
admissible under s. 178.16(1) (a). A new trial was accordingly ordered.

Held (Laskin
C.J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz, Estey, Pratte and Mclntyre JJ.: In addition to
its submissions on the points raised by the appellant the Crown argued that the
intercepted conversations were not private communications within the meaning of
s. 178.1  of the Criminal Code  because Dwyer, who originated them, had
consented to and knew of the interception and that accordingly Part IV.1 of the
Code did not apply and the conversations were admissible under the common
law rules of evidence. The point was not argued at trial and not decided by the
Court of Appeal which relied on other grounds for its decision. Once under the
definition of “private communication”, it is the originator’s state of mind
that is decisive. If Dwyer was the sole originator of the communications then
they were not private within the terms of the Protection of Privacy Act and
they would not be subject to the terms of Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code . There
is however the distinction that the Code speaks of a “private
communication” and not of a “private conversation”. It would be an over
simplification to say that, in the case of a telephone conversation, the
“originator of the private communication” is the person who made the call; or
that in the case of a direct conversation the originator was either the
arranger of the meeting or the person who made the first remark. Conversation
is the broader term and includes an interchange of a series of communications.
It is consistent with the scheme of Part IV.1 to consider that the originator
of a private communication (under s. 178.1 ) is the person who makes the remark
or series of remarks which the Crown seeks to adduce in evidence. Such a
person, speaking with a reasonable expectation of privacy, who makes statements
in an electronically intercepted conversation, has, as the originator of them,
the protection of the privacy provisions of the Criminal Code . The
admissibility of the statements at any subsequent trial will depend on Part
IV.1 of the Code. To the extent that the conversations in this appeal
were originated by the appellant they were private under the Act.

While there had been no judicial
authorization for the interceptions and the Crown relied solely on a consent to
intercept under s. 178.11(2) (a), it is clear, first, that

[Page 978]

prior to the passing of the Protection of
Privacy Act interceptions such as these were lawful and further that the
only Criminal Code  provision which could render them unlawful is
s. 178.11(1). Subsection (2) of s. 178.11  excepts from the strictures
of subs. (1) an interception by consent. A consent interception under s.
178.11(2)  is thus unaffected by subs. (1) and remains lawful. The interceptions
here, if made with a valid consent, would be lawful under s. 178.16(1)  and
evidence thereof admissible.

The courts below did not err in their
determination of what constituted consent. Consent must be voluntary (i.e. free
from coercion) and made knowingly, with an awareness of the significance of the
consent. On the evidence here the consent was valid and legally effective.

Finally the admission of the signed consent
of Dwyer did not contravene the hearsay rule—Dwyer not having been called to
give evidence at the trial. The consent in question [under s. 178.11(2) (a)]
may be express or implied and on the evidence the Crown properly discharged the
onus upon it and raised a clear implication of consent.

Per Laskin
C.J., dissenting: In Rosen v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
961, the point was made in dissent that the ex post facto consent given
in that case to make conversations with the accused admissible against him,
being procured by the Crown by a promise of benefit, was not voluntary. If that
dissent was right on this point, the present case is a fortiori. Once an
improper inducement is established any confession that follows is tainted and
inadmissible in evidence. Such a fundamental question as the voluntariness of a
consent cannot be avoided by calling it a question of fact. The confession
cases do not support the position that notwithstanding a threat or fear of
prejudice, or promise of benefit or advantage, there may still be a finding of
voluntariness as being one of fact. The proper construction of the definition
of “private communication” and the meaning of “originator” should be left open.

[Page 979]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] allowing an appeal
against an acquittal on a charge of conspiracy, with others, to pass
counterfeit money. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. dissenting.

Earl J. Levy, Q.C., for the appellant.

David Watt, for the respondent.

The following are the reasons delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—In my
reasons in Rosen v. The Queen[2], which
are being issued concurrently with the reasons that now follow in this case, I
took the point, as a decisive ground for ordering a new trial, the the ex
post facto consent given in the Rosen case to make conversations
with the accused admissible against him, being procured by the Crown by a
promise of benefit, was not voluntary. The conversations were, therefore, not
admissible. If I was right on this point in the Rosen case then, in the
present case, it is a fortiori.

Whereas in Rosen there was an illegally
intercepted communication and the ex post facto consent was intended to
make it admissible in evidence, here the promise of leniency to one Dwyer (who
was found in possession of counterfeit bills) preceded the recording of any
conversation with the appellant Goldman. In reliance on the promise of
leniency, Dwyer proceeded to co-operate with the police who, having his written
consent, intercepted a telephone conversation and also a face-to-face
conversation during which Dwyer wore a concealed body pack. The distinction
taken by my brother Mclntyre (in refusing to adapt the confession rule to
privacy cases) between an inculpatory statement induced by a promise of benefit
held out by a person in authority and an already intercepted communication does
not apply in the present case.

[Page 980]

True, there may be a formal similarity in the
two situations, but where the promise of benefit or fear of prejudice, as the
case may be, induces a person in Dwyer’s position to initiate a private
communication with an accused which is going to be intercepted by the police,
there is the likelihood of leading the accused into damaging statements in order
to redeem the promise of benefit or avoid any likely prejudice. It must be
remembered that in this case Dwyer, after completing his assignment for the
police, went back to the United States and was not available to give evidence at Goldman’s trial.

To repeat, if I was correct in Rosen, the
present case is a fortiori. Moreover, I am unable to appreciate how such
a fundamental question as the voluntariness of a consent can be avoided by
calling it a question of fact. The confession cases do not, in my opinion,
support the position that notwithstanding a threat or fear of prejudice, or
promise of benefit of advantage, there may still be a finding of voluntariness
as being one of fact. Once an improper inducement is established, any
confession that follows is tainted and is inadmissible in evidence: see
Kaufman, Admissibility of Confessions (2nd ed. 1973), c. 5, at pp. 70 et
seq.

Although this is enough to dispose of the
present case (in which I would set aside the order for a new trial by the
Ontario Court of Appeal and restore the acquittal at trial), there are other
important questions here which merit canvass. In Rosen, I was content to
proceed on the assumption that the phrase “lawfully made” in s. 178.16(1) (a)
covered both judicially authorized interceptions and interceptions made with
prior consent, leaving s. 178.16(1) (b) as a provision envisaging ex
post facto consent to admission in evidence of an interception that was
originally illegal. I am not prepared to rest on this assumption in this case.
In my opinion, there is at least ambiguity in the words “lawfully made”, and
good ground for resolving it in favour of the policy of protection of privacy.

[Page 981]

The present Criminal Code  provisions with
which we are concerned originated in the Protection of Privacy Act, 1973-1974
(Can.), c. 50, an Act which not only added a new Part IV.1 to the Criminal
Code  under the heading “Invasion of Privacy”, but as well a new
Part I.1 to the Crown Liability Act, also headed “Invasion of
Privacy” and also amended the Official Secrets Act to authorize the
Solicitor General to issue warrants for intercepting communications where
evidence under oath satisfied him that the interception was necessary for the
prevention or detection of subversive activity or necessary to safeguard the
security of Canada. The amendment went on to specify the contents of a warrant
so issued.

It is by no means clear to me that prior to the
passing of the Protection of Privacy Act interceptions such as those
made here were lawful. They were at least civil trespasses or invasions of
privacy, although, in line with the common law, the fruits of the interceptions
were, if relevant to an issue in a criminal trial, admissible in evidence. If
the words “lawfully made” in s. 178.16(1) (a) mean simply not prohibited
by law then, of course, they would cover interceptions made with prior consent
as well as those made through judicial authorization.

I set out here the relevant provisions of the Criminal
Code  which give perspective to the view that I hold of the words “lawfully
made”. They are as follows:

178.1 In this Part,

“authorization” means an authorization to
intercept a private communication given under section 178.13 or
subsection 178.15(2);

“private communication” means any oral
communication or any telecommunication made under circumstances in which it is
reasonable for the originator thereof to expect that it will not be intercepted
by any person other than the person intended by the originator thereof to
receive it;

[Page 982]

178.11 (1) Every one who, by means of an
electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device, wilfully intercepts a
private communication is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to
imprisonment for five years.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to

(a) a person who has the consent to
intercept, express or implied, of the originator of the private communication
or of the person intended by the originator thereof to receive it;

(b) a person who intercepts a
private communication in accordance with an authorization or any person who in
good faith aids in any way a person whom he has reasonable and probable grounds
to believe is acting with any such authorization;

(c) a person engaged in providing a
telephone, telegraph or other communication service to the public who intercepts
a private communication,

(i) if such interception is necessary for
the purpose of providing such service,

(ii) in the course of service observing or
random monitoring necessary for the purpose of mechanical or service quality
control checks, or

(iii) if such interception is necessary to
protect the person’s rights or property directly related to providing such
service; or

(d) an officer or servant of Her
Majesty in right of Canada in
respect of a private communication intercepted by him in the course of random
monitoring that is necessarily incidental to radio frequency spectrum
management in Canada.

(3) Where a private communication is
originated by more than one person or is intended by the originator thereof to
be received by more than one person, a consent to the interception thereof by
any one of such persons is sufficient for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a),
subsection 178.16(1)  and subsection 178.2(1) .

178.12 An application for an authorization
shall be made ex parte and in writing to a judge of a superior court of
criminal jurisdiction, or a judge as defined in section 482 and shall be
signed by the Attorney General of the province in which the application is made
or the Solicitor General of Canada or an agent specially designated in writing
for the purposes of this section by

(a) the Solicitor General of Canada personally, if the offence under
investigation is one in respect of which proceedings, if any, may be instituted
at the instance

[Page 983]

of the Government of Canada and conducted
by or on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada, or

(b) the Attorney General of a
province personally, in respect of any other offence in that province,

and shall be accompanied by an affidavit
which may be sworn on the information and belief of a peace officer or public
officer deposing to the following matters, namely:

(c) the facts relied upon to justify
the belief that an authorization should be given together with particulars of
the offence;

(d) the type of private
communication proposed to be intercepted;

(e) the names and addresses, if
known, of all persons, the interception of whose private communications there
are reasonable and probable grounds to believe may assist the investigation of
the offence, and if not known, a general description of the place at which
private communications are proposed to be intercepted or, if a general
description of that place cannot be given, a general description of the manner
of interception proposed to be used;

(f) the period for which the
authorization is requested; and

(g) whether other investigative
procedures have been tried and have failed or why it appears they are unlikely
to succeed or that the urgency of the matter is such that it would be
impractical to carry out the investigation of the offence using only other investigative
procedures. 1973, c. 50, s. 2. 

178.13 (1) An authorization may be given if
the judge to whom the application is made is satisfied that it would be in the
best interests of the administration of justice to do so and that

(a) other investigative procedures
have been tried and have failed;

(b) other investigative procedures
are unlikely to succeed; and

(c) the urgency of the matter is
such that it would be impractical to carry out the investigation of the offence
using only other investigative procedures.

(2) An authorization shall

(a) state the offence in respect of
which private communications may be intercepted;

(b) state the type of private
communication that may be intercepted;

[Page 984]

(c) state the identity of the
persons, if known, whose private communications are to be intercepted and where
the identity of such persons is not known, generally describe the place at
which private communications may be intercepted or, if a general description of
that place cannot be given, generally describe the manner of interception that
may be used;

(d) contain such terms and
conditions as the judge considers advisable in the public interest; and

(e) be valid for the period, not
exceeding thirty days, set forth therein.

…

178.15 (1) Notwithstanding section 178.12,
an application for an authorization may be made ex parte to a judge of a
superior court of criminal jurisdiction, or a judge as defined in
section 482, designated from time to time by the Chief Justice, by a peace
officer specially designated in writing for the purposes of this
section by

(a) the Solicitor General of Canada,
if the offence is one in respect of which proceedings, if any, may be
instituted by the Government of Canada and conducted by or on behalf of the
Attorney General of Canada, or

(b) the Attorney General of a
province, in respect of any other offence in the province,

if the urgency of the situation requires
interception of private communications to commence before an authorization
could, with reasonable diligence, be obtained under section 178.13.

(2) Where the judge to whom an application
is made pursuant to subsection (1) is satisfied that the urgency of the
situation requires that interception of private communications commence before
an authorization could, with reasonable diligence, be obtained pursuant to
section 178.13, he may, on such terms and conditions, if any, as he
considers advisable, give an authorization in writing for a period of up to
thirty-six hours.

(3) For the purposes of section 178.16
only, an interception of a private communication in accordance with an
authorization given pursuant to this section shall be deemed not to have
been lawfully made unless the judge who gave the authorization or, if such
judge is unable to act, a judge of the same jurisdiction, certifies that if the
application for the authorization had been made to him pursuant to
section 178.12 he would have given the authorization.

…

178.16 (1) A private communication that has
been intercepted and evidence obtained directly or indirectly

[Page 985]

as a result of information acquired by
interception of a private communication are both inadmissible as evidence
against the originator thereof or the person intended by the originator thereof
to receive it unless

(a) the interception was lawfully
made; or

(b) the originator of the private
communication or the person intended by the originator thereof to receive it
has expressly consented to the admission thereof.

(2) Where in any proceedings the judge is
of the opinion that any private communication or any other evidence that is
inadmissible pursuant to subsection (1)

(a) is relevant, and

(b) is inadmissible by reason only
of a defect of form or an irregularity in procedure, not being a substantive
defect or irregularity, in the application for or the giving of the
authorization under which such private communication was intercepted or by
means of which such evidence was obtained, or

(c) that, in the case of evidence,
other than the private communication itself, to exclude it as evidence may
result in justice not being done.

he may, notwithstanding
subsection (1), admit such private communication or evidence as evidence
in such proceedings.

…

(4) A private communication that has been
lawfully intercepted shall not be received in evidence unless the party intending
to adduce it has given to the accused reasonable notice of his intention
together with

(a) a transcript of the private
communication, where it will be adduced in the form of a recording, or a
statement setting forth full particulars of the private communication, where
evidence of the private communication will be given viva voce; and

(b) a statement respecting the time,
place and date of the private communication and the parties thereto, if known.

…

I refer also to provisions of the Crown
Liability Act as added by the Protection of Privacy Act, these
being,

7.1 In this Part,

“authorization” means an authorization to
intercept a private communication given under section 178.13  of the Criminal
Code ;

…

[Page 986]

7.2 (1) Subject to subsection (2), where
a servant of the Crown, by means of an electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or
other device, intentionally intercepts a private communication, in the course
of his employment, the Crown is liable for all loss or damage caused by or
attributable to such interception, and for punitive damages in an amount not
exceeding $5,000, to each person who incurred such loss or damage.

(2) The Crown is not liable under
subsection (1) for loss or damage or punitive damages referred to therein
where the interception complained of

(a) was lawfully made;

(b) was made with the consent,
express or implied, of the originator of the private communication or of the
person intended by the originator thereof to receive it; or

(c) was made by an officer or
servant of the Crown in the course of random monitoring that is necessarily
incidental to radio frequency spectrum management in Canada.

…

The tort liability imposed upon the Crown by s.
7.2(1) above parallels the criminal liability imposed by s. 178.11(1)  of the Criminal
Code , but in each case there are qualifying or saving provisions found in
s. 7.2(2)  and s. 178.11(2)  respectively. The qualification of tort liability
under s. 7.2(2) (a) where the interception was “lawfully made”
necessarily excludes express or implied consent to an interception since this
is provided for under s. 7.2(2) (b), being in the same wording as s.
178.11(1) (b) of the Criminal Code . So too, s. 7.2(2) (c) is
a particular saving provision which again limits the meaning of “lawfully made”
in s. 7.2(2) (a). It appears to me to follow that the words “lawfully
made” refer to a judicial authorization, having regard to the fact that
“authorization” is defined in s. 7.1 of the amended Crown Liability Act by
reference to the definition of this word in s. 178.13  of the Criminal Code . The
way in which the Criminal Code  amendments and those in the Crown
Liability Act are tied together strongly supports the conclusion that the
same construction should be placed upon the words “lawfully made” in both
statutes.

[Page 987]

Even if reference is had to the Criminal Code 
amendments alone, their context under the Protection of Privacy Act points
to a difference between interceptions that, because of judicial authorization,
are “lawfully made” and those that are made with consent. This difference is
reflected in s. 178.15(3) as well as in s. 178.16(2)(b). Thus, s.
178.15(3) opens with the words “For the purposes of s. 178.16 only, an
interception of a private communication in accordance with an authorization
given pursuant to this section shall be deemed not to have been lawfully
made unless.”, and the provisions of s. 178.16(2)(b) referring to
defects in form of an authorization, are consistent with the view that
“lawfully made” refers to judicial authorization. They cannot have any
application to interceptions under s. 178.11(2) (a) or to those permitted
for the limited purposes of s. 178.11(2) (c) and (d). Again, the
notice provisions of s. 178.16(4) bear a similarity to the information that
must be included in an authorization under s. 178.13  and thus reinforce my view
that s. 178.16(1) (a) applies only to judicial authorization of an
interception.

In my opinion, s. 178.16, in the light of the
elaborate controls set up under ss. 178.11 to 178.14 was designed to protect
privacy of communication by altering the common law rule as to admission of
illegally obtained evidence, so that even if collaboration with the police
resulted under s. 178.11(2) (a), this did not ipso facto make the
evidence obtained by a consensual interception admissible without a further
consent under s. 178.16(1) (b). I do not agree that the legislation under
examination is sufficiently clear to warrant the conclusion that a consent
under s. 178.11(2) (a) dispenses with any further consent in relation to
admissibility. Indeed, s. 178.16(2) reinforces this position.

In principle, I see a vast difference between a
judicial authorization for an interception which, at the same time, would make
its fruits admissible in evidence and a prior consent by a private person to

[Page 988]

an interception destroying another’s expected
privacy. Of course, Parliament could prescribe that for the purpose of
admissibility in evidence both situations be treated the same way. It has not,
however, done so with the clarity that should be present to enable A., by
consenting to an interception of private communications with B., to make those
communications admissible without more against B. It is not only that one may
distinguish the positive words “lawfully made” from the excepting terms of s. 178.11(2) (a)
(framed in the negative), but there are the other indications of a difference
running through the various sections that I have quoted, sufficient to
establish an ambiguity in s. 178.16(1) (a) and to support subject matter
in a requirement of a further consent under s. 178.16(1) (b).

The two points I have taken are enough to
dispose of this case and I leave for consideration on another occasion the
admissibility in evidence of Dwyer’s signed consent when he himself was not
available as a witness. Again, I leave open the question of the proper
constitution of the definition of “private communication”, especially in
respect of the meaning of “originator”.

As I have previously indicated, I would allow
the appeal, set aside the order of the Ontario Court of Appeal and restore the
acquittal at trial.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon,
Dickson, Beetz, Estey, Pratte and Mclntyre JJ. was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—This is an appeal from the judgment
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which allowed a Crown appeal against the
acquittal of the appellant, sometimes referred to hereafter as Goldman, on a
charge of conspiracy with one Cremascoli (now deceased), one Dwyer, and others
unknown, to possess counterfeit American money. The Crown’s case depended upon
the admission in evidence of recordings made by the police of two conversations
between the appellant and Dwyer on May 20, 1976. The first was a telephone
conversation, and the second a direct conversation between Dwyer and the
appellant during which Dwyer was fitted with a concealed body pack,
transmissions

[Page 989]

from which were recorded by the police who were
some distance away.

Dwyer was arrested in the United States and
found to be in possession of counterfeit United States money. To avoid serious
punishment, he agreed to assist the police. He was brought to Canada and gave a
consent in writing to the interception of his conversations with Goldman. After
completing his part in the matter, he returned to the United States and has
since not been seen by agents of the Crown. There is evidence, however, that he
has been interviewed by representatives of the appellant.

The Crown tendered the evidence of intercepted
conversations at Goldman’s trial and a voir dire lasting some six days
was held to determine the admissibility of such evidence. Dwyer was not called
as a witness. The trial judge refused to admit the evidence. He considered that
Dwyer had given a bona fide consent to the interception of the communications
with Goldman free from any police coercion even though Dwyer was not present in
court to give evidence before him. However, he also concluded that the
interceptions, having been made without any judicial authorization, were not
lawfully made within the meaning of s. 178.16(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code . He therefore concluded that they could not be admitted in evidence
and, since Dwyer’s consent to the interception did not include a consent to the
admission of the evidence under s. 178.16(1) (b), it was excluded. The
Crown adduced no other evidence except to prove the circumstances relating to
the arrest of Dwyer and an acquittal resulted.

The Court of Appeal adopted a different view. It
accepted the trial judge’s finding as to the nature of the consent given by
Dwyer, but it went further and held that the giving of such consent made the
interception lawful. The evidence was therefore held to be admissible under s.
178.16(1) (a). The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered.

[Page 990]

The appellant raised several grounds of appeal
in this Court. To summarize, it was contended that the Court of Appeal was
wrong in holding that an interception of a private communication is lawfully
made under s. 178.16(1) (a) when made by a consent under s. 178.11(2) (a)
and without judicial authorization; that it was wrong in its determination of
what constitutes a valid consent under s. 178.11(2) (a) of the Criminal
Code ; that it was wrong in holding that Dwyer did in fact consent to the
interception; and that it was wrong in admitting in evidence a form of consent
signed by Dwyer when he gave no evidence at trial. The Crown, in addition to
its submissions on the points raised by the appellant, argued that the
intercepted conversations were not private communications within the meaning of
s. 178.1  of the Criminal Code  because Dwyer, who originated them, had
consented to and knew of the interception and consequently had no reasonable
belief that the conversations would not be intercepted. Therefore, it was said,
Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  did not apply and the conversations were
admissible under common law rules of evidence. This point was not argued at
trial. It was raised in the Court of Appeal but not decided because the court
relied upon other grounds for its decision. Because of its importance in the
case, I propose to deal with it at the outset.

Section 178.1  defines a “private
communication” in these terms:

“private communication” means any oral
communication or any telecommunication made under circumstances in which it is
reasonable for the originator thereof to expect that it will not be intercepted
by any person other than the person intended by the originator thereof to
receive it;

Prior to the coming into effect of the Protection
of Privacy Act in 1974 which amended the Criminal Code  by the
addition of Part IV.1, an intercepted communication of the kind described above
was admissible in evidence, subject to established common law rules of
evidence, without the statutory restrictions now found in Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code  (ss. 178.1  and 178.11  to 178.22  inclusive). One effect of Part IV.1
was to break

[Page 991]

new ground and impose restrictions upon the
admission of such evidence. Section 178.11  is reproduced hereunder:

178.11 (1) Every one who, by means of an
electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device, wilfully intercepts a
private communication is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to
imprisonment for five years.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to

(a) a person who has the consent to
intercept, express or implied, of the originator of the private communication
or of the person intended by the originator thereof to receive it;

(b) a person who intercepts a
private communication in accordance with an authorization or any person who in
good faith aids in any way a person whom he has reasonable and probable grounds
to believe is acting with any such authorization;

(c) a person engaged in providing a
telephone, telegraph or other communication service to the public who
intercepts a private communication,

(i) if such interception is necessary for
the purpose of providing such service,

(ii) in the course of service observing or
random monitoring necessary for the purpose of mechanical or service quality
control checks, or

(iii) if such interception is necessary to
protect the person’s rights or property directly related to providing such
service; or

(d) an officer or servant of Her
Majesty in right of Canada in respect of a private communication intercepted by
him in the course of random monitoring that is necessarily incidental to radio
frequency spectrum management in Canada.

(3) Where a private communication is
originated by more than one person or is intended by the originator thereof to
be received by more than one person, a consent to the interception thereof by
any one of such persons is sufficient for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a),
subsection 178.16(1)  and subsection 178.2(1) .

The facts, so far as they relate to this point,
may be shortly stated. On May 20, 1976, in Toronto, at about 8:00 a.m., Dwyer
in the presence of police officers made a telephone call to Goldman. A device
had been installed upon the telephone which enabled the recording of this
conversation. This

[Page 992]

fact was, of course, known to Dwyer but unknown
to Goldman. By this time Dwyer had agreed to co-operate with the police and to
assist in the investigation. The same day, a body pack transmission device was
concealed upon Dwyer’s person by the police with Dwyer’s consent. Dwyer then
went to Goldman’s office where he met and had a fifteen minute conversation
with him. By means of the concealed body pack, the police, who were some
distance away, were able to receive and record the conversation. Prior to the
phone call and the meeting with the appellant, Dwyer had signed a form of
consent to the interception of his conversations with the appellant.

For the purpose of dealing with this branch of
the case, it is not necessary to consider whether the consent on the part of
Dwyer was a valid and effective consent or whether the written consent was
properly admissible in evidence. These questions will be dealt with later. It
is sufficient to observe that it was abundantly clear that, during both the
telephone conversation and the personal conversation which followed, Dwyer was
fully aware that the police were intercepting and recording the words spoken.
Dwyer then had no reasonable expectation that the conversations would not be
intercepted. It must be accepted as well that the appellant was unaware of any
interception. There is no evidence to suggest that he was aware of Dwyer’s
involvement with the police. It is a reasonable assumption, which I make for
the purpose of this argument, that Goldman did have a reasonable expectation
that the conversation would not be intercepted, in other words, that it would
be a private communication.

It will be observed at once that under the
definition of “private communication” it is the originator’s state of mind that
is decisive. It follows, in my opinion, that if Dwyer was the sole originator
of the communications they were not private communications within the meaning
of the Act. They would not be subject to the terms of Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code . The appellant’s state of mind on the question would seem to be of no
significance. It should also be observed, however, that the definition in the Criminal
Code  speaks of a “private communication” and not of a “private

[Page 993]

conversation”. It falls for the court to
determine whether there is any difference in the two words, for if there is and
if a conversation is made up of a series of communications given and received
by each of the participants the problem is more difficult. The conversation
would have to be broken down into its several component communications and
those communications originated by Dwyer would not be subject to Part IV.1 of
the Criminal Code  and would be admissible at common law as if Part IV.1
had not been enacted. Those originated by Goldman, who was innocent of
knowledge of the police role in the matter, would be subject to the provisions
of Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  and their admissibility against him
would be determinable under the provisions of that part of the Criminal
Code . The extent of the applicability of Part IV.1 must therefore be
determined.

Where one is considering a telephone
conversation, it would be tempting to say that the originator of the private
communication is the person who made the call. It would be equally possible to
consider the originator to be the person who spoke first regardless of who made
the call. When considering a direct conversation, one could consider as the
originator of the entire conversation either the arranger of the meeting at
which the conversation took place or the person who made the first remark. The
adoption of such arbitrary tests, however, involves, in my view, an
oversimplification. There has been little Canadian authority on this point and
none which binds this Court. This is the first occasion when it has fallen for
decision here. In R. v. Miller & Thomas (No. 1)[3], it seems to have been considered that the
originator of a private telephone conversation was the person who made the
call. In an unreported case in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, R. v.
Jasicek, McKay J., in making a ruling on the admissibility of certain
evidence during the course of the trial, rejected the argument that a
conversation must be broken down into its separate communications. He
considered it would involve a “strained and unrealistic interpretation of clear
words in the statute”. In R. v. Zoell, in the Saskatchewan Court
of

[Page 994]

Appeal, April 4, 1977 (as yet unreported), a
case dealing with a charge of possession of an electromagnetic device for
scanning radio broadcasts contrary to s. 178.18(1)  of the Criminal Code , the
question arose whether police broadcasts made by police with the knowledge of a
high probability of unauthorized interception were private communications. Some
inferential support may be found for the separate communication argument in the
words of Culliton C.J.S. where he said:

It is to be noted that the criterion to be
applied in determining what constitutes a “private communication” is an
objective one. That test relates only to what is in the mind of the sender. In
the present case the test is simply this. In the circumstances, as shown by the
evidence, under which oral radio communications are regularly made by the
Regina City Police over the assigned radio frequency, can it be said, that
the sender of such communications can reasonably expect that they will not be
intercepted by any person other than the persons intended to receive them?
(Emphasis added.)

The purpose, it has been frequently said, of
Part IV.1 of the Code was to protect the right to privacy. It may be
more realistic to say that the purpose or effect of Part IV.1 has been to
regulate the method of breach of any such right. That the right may be subject
to frequent lawful breach is clear from the scheme of Part IV.1 but the courts
must be astute to limit breaches to the extent provided by the Code. With
that thought in mind, it must be observed that Part IV.1 applies to the
electronic interception of private communications not private conversations. In
such judicial comment as I have been able to find, the courts have generally
seemed to consider that communication in this context is synonymous with
conversation. Accepting this view, they have simply said that he who starts the
conversation is the originator. It is evident that the determination of the
originator of any given communication must be made upon a construction of the
words of the Code.

It is elementary to say that the courts must
discern and apply the legislative intent when construing the statutes. The
intent must be found upon an examination of the words employed in the enactment
for it is the intent which the legislature

[Page 995]

expressed which must have effect. It is for this
reason that the meaning of statutory language must be examined and on occasions
fine distinctions must be made. In my view, the difference between the word
conversation and the word communication is, in the context of this statutory
provision, significant. A communication involves the passing of thoughts,
ideas, words or information from one person to another. Conversation is a
broader term and it would include, as all conversations do, an interchange of a
series of separate communications. It is consistent with the scheme of Part
IV.1, in my view, to consider that the originator of a private communication
within the meaning of s. 178.1  is the person who makes the remark or series of
remarks which the Crown seeks to adduce in evidence. If a person, with a
reasonable expectation of privacy, speaking in an electronically intercepted
conversation makes statements which the Crown seeks to use against him, he has,
in my view, as the originator of those statements, the protection of the
privacy provisions of the Criminal Code  because those statements
constitute private communications upon his part and their admissibility at any
subsequent trial will depend upon the provisions of Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code . I do not find this a strained or unrealistic interpretation of the
words of the statute. In fact, where a police officer or police agent
participates in a conversation with a suspect knowing that it is being
intercepted electronically and hears the suspect make hoped for inculpatory
statements of importance to the Crown’s case, I am unable to consider the
police officer to be the originator of the very statement or statements he was
seeking to obtain.

It follows from what I have said that the Act
applies here to those statements in the telephone conversation and personal
conversation between Dwyer and the appellant which were originated by the
appellant. To the extent that the conversations were so originated the
communications were private communications under the Act and the Act applies to
them.

I now turn to the other points taken in argument
on behalf of the appellant. It was contended that the Court of Appeal was in
error when it held that

[Page 996]

the interceptions were admissible in evidence
under the provisions of s. 178.16(1) (a) as being lawfully made when there had
been no judicial authorization for the making of the interceptions and the
Crown relied solely on a consent to intercept under s. 178.11(2) (a).

Section 178.11  is reproduced above and the
relevant parts of s. 178.16 as they then stood are reproduced hereunder:

178.16 (1) A private communication that has
been intercepted and evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of
information acquired by interception of a private communication are both
inadmissible as evidence against the originator thereof or the person intended
by the originator thereof to receive it unless

(a) the interception was lawfully
made; or

(b) the originator of the private
communication or the person intended by the originator thereof to receive it
has expressly consented to the admission thereof.

In dealing with this point Brooke J.A. for the
Court of Appeal said:

With the greatest deference I do not agree
with the conclusion that the tape recordings were inadmissible in evidence as
the interception was not lawfully made within the meaning of s. 178.16. Like
some others, the learned trial judge interpreted the judgment of this Court in R.
v. LaSarge (1976), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 388, as holding that to be
lawfully made and admissible under s. 178.16 an interception must be made
pursuant to an authorization provided for in Part IV of the Code. In my
opinion, this is not the effect of that decision. In both the judgments of
Houlden, J.A. and that of Martin, J.A., it is clear that consent was not in
issue there but that in the circumstances of the case to be lawfully made the
interception required an authorization.

Section 178.16 provides for the
admissibility in evidence of an interception of a private communication in two
circumstances. The evidence of the interception is admissible, first, if the
interception was lawfully made and, second, evidence of all other interceptions
is admissible with the consent specified in s. 178.16(1) (b). An
interception of a private communication is lawfully made if one of the parties
to it consented to the interception. Prior to the passing of Part IV there was
no protection against the person to whom one chose to speak consenting to
another listening in. Part IV proceeds on the same basis. This Court in R.
v. Douglas (1977), 33 C.C.C.

[Page 997]

(2d) 395 affirmed the admissibility in
evidence of an interception made with consent of a party to it who was an
undercover agent when no authorization covered the interception (see Zuber,
J.A., pp. 400-401). In my opinion an interception is lawfully made if made
under circumstances enumerated by s. 178.11(2) .

I am in full agreement with Brooke J.A. in his
comments above quoted and I agree with him that R. v. LaSarge[4] is not authority for the proposition that
the words “lawfully made” in s. 178.16(1) (a) mean only an
interception made by judicial authorization. Section 178.11(1)  makes it an
indictable offence to intercept a private communication by means of the devices
described and in subs. (2) provides that subs. (1) which created the offence
will not apply to a person who has the consent, express or implied, of the
originator of the private communication or of the person intended to receive
it. This consent is a consent to interception and its effect is to preserve
from illegality, in other words to render lawful, an interception of a private
communication made with consent. It is important to note as well that the
consent may be express or implied and may be given by either the originator of
the private communication or the intended recipient. Section 178.16 is
complementary to s. 178.11 . It deals with admissibility of evidence which
has been obtained by interceptions of private communications. It provides that
an intercepted private communication is inadmissible as evidence against its
originator or the person intended to receive it unless it was lawfully made or
unless the originator or the person intended to receive it has expressly
consented to the admission. The Crown does not allege that any such consent as
that envisaged in s. 178.16(1) (b) was given in the case at bar.
Therefore, that subsection is not relevant to the case. However, it is
worthwhile to note that the 178.16(1)(b) consent differs from the
consent in s. 178.11(2) (a) in that it is a consent to admit evidence not
to intercept. The Crown’s position here is simply this, by virtue of Dwyer’s
consent given under s. 178.11(2) (a), the interceptions were lawfully
made within the meaning of s. 178.16(1) (a) and evidence thereof was
admissible

[Page 998]

notwithstanding the absence of any further
consent under s. 178.16(1) (b).

The appellant contended that the words “lawfully
made” in s. 178.16(1) (a) referred only to an interception made under a
judicial authorization under s. 178.11(2) (a). To support this position,
he referred to the amendments to the Crown Liability Act which were also
made in the Protection of Privacy Act in s. 7.2 part of which is
reproduced hereunder:

7.2 (1) Subject to subsection (2),
where a servant of the Crown, by means of an electromagnetic, acoustic,
mechanical or other device, intentionally intercepts a private communication,
in the course of his employment, the Crown is liable for all loss or damage
caused by or attributable to such interception, and for punitive damages in an
amount not exceeding $5,000 to each person who incurred such loss or damage.

(2) The Crown is not liable under
subsection (1) for loss or damage or punitive damages referred to therein
where the interception complained of

(a) was lawfully made;

(b) was made with the consent,
express or implied, of the originator of the private communication or of the
person intended by the originator thereof to receive it;

…

It will be seen that subs. 7.2(1) creates
“tortious liability” upon the Crown for intentional interception of private
communications and subs. (2) relieves against such liability where (a) the
interception has been lawfully made, and (b) when it is made with consent. It
was argued that this enactment established a difference between an interception
lawfully made and one made by consent so that the words “lawfully made” would
not include an interception made by consent. This distinction, it was said,
should be preserved throughout the entire Protection of Privacy Act with
the result that an interception “lawfully made” within the meaning of s.
178.16(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  should not include an
interception made by consent under s. 178.11(2) (a) of the Criminal
Code .

[Page 999]

I am not prepared to accept this argument by
analogy. It was said that well established canons of construction dictated that
words should receive a uniform meaning when used repeatedly in the same statute
or in one in para materia. Following this principle, it was said, the
separate parts of the Protection of Privacy Act which amended the Criminal
Code , the Crown Liability Act and the Official Secrets Act, respectively,
should be construed as a unified whole, providing one body of law applying to
the separate situations covered by the separate Acts which were amended. I have
no quarrel with the general proposition thus expressed but, in my view, it has
no application here. Canons of construction find their principal use where
there is ambiguity. They must not be employed, however, to twist and torture
the plain meaning of words. Furthermore, it is not every inconsistency or
contradiction in a statute which will justify reliance on artificial rules of
construction in order to find a meaning which would not otherwise be clearly
apparent and which would be contradictory to a clear expression of intent.
Whatever questions may arise in attempting to reconcile the alleged differences
between the Criminal Code  amendments made in the Protection of
Privacy Act and the amendments there made to the Crown Liability Act, it
is perfectly clear that prior to the passing of the Protection of Privacy
Act interceptions such as those in question here were lawful. It is equally
clear that the only provision in the Criminal Code  which could render
such interceptions unlawful is s. 178.11(1) . It is also clear that subs. (2) of
s. 178.11  excepts from the strictures of subs. (1) an interception by consent.
It follows then unmistakably that a consent interception under s. 178.11(2)  is
unaffected by subs. (1) and remains lawful. Therefore the interception here, if
made with a valid consent, would be lawfully made within the meaning of s.
178.16(1) (a) and evidence thereof would be admissible.

The second and third points argued by the
appellant may be dealt with together and they will require some more detailed
reference to the evidence. It was argued that the Court of Appeal and

[Page 1000]

the trial judge were in error in their
determination of what constituted a consent under s. 178.11(2) (a)
and in the further finding that Dwyer in fact gave a valid consent.

Dwyer was arrested in Florida on May 17, 1976.
He had been caught while trying to pass a counterfeit fifty dollar American
bill in a retail store. A search made of his person on his arrest revealed that
he was then carrying three more fifty dollar counterfeit bills and two
conterfeit ten dollar bills, all American. He was questioned by the American
authorities. He directed the police to a restaurant where a woman friend of his
gave to the police a further quantity of American counterfeit notes to a face
value of four thousand one hundred and ninety dollars. Dwyer was released the
same day on his own recognizance in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars
with no deposit. He appeared as required the following day before a U.S.
magistrate and was released on his own recognizance in the amount of five
thousand dollars without deposit, Dwyer agreed to co-operate with the police in
the matter and that day flew to Toronto with the American police officers. From
the evidence of American police, it was clear that Dwyer had been questioned at
length after his arrest as had his woman friend. They had been told of possible
charges they would face which could involve maximum sentences of imprisonment
for fifteen years. In the result, Dwyer pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted
uttering of counterfeit money. His plea was taken in the magistrate’s chambers
and he was released on probation. No charges were preferred against his woman
friend but the officer acknowledged that they were “held in abeyance”. The
officers denied that any threats or inducements were employed in the matter.

Dwyer was interrogated by the police on his
arrival in Toronto. A police officer, one Constable Sayers of the Toronto
police, described how the interceptions were made. He interviewed Dwyer about
8.00 p.m. on May 19, 1976. He said he explained the consent form which he
presented to Dwyer and Dwyer signed it. This form is exhibit 11 and is in these
words:

CONSENT

I, Michael Dwyer, of the Municipality of Toronto,
in the County of York, in the Province of Ontario, hereby expressly consent to
the interception by means of an electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other
device of any private communications to which I am a party either as an
originator or intended recipient by officers of Metropolitan Toronto Police and
such other persons as may be necessary to assist them in the interception of
the abovementioned private communications from this date until the
investigation is concluded.

Laverne M. Sayers, P.C. 2999

He then installed a voice transmitter on Dwyer’s
back. It was concealed by Dwyer’s clothing. The officer then posted himself at
the rear of the location described as the Bermuda Tavern. There he recorded
transmissions from Dwyer’s body pack of a conversation of some three hours’
duration from the interior of the tavern. The results of this adventure did not
satisfy the police. There was some dissatisfaction expressed by them with
Dwyer’s performance and a second attempt was made on May 20, 1976.

On this occasion, and I am again relying largely
on the evidence of Sayers, at 8:00 a.m. Sayers put

[Page 1002]

an electronic device on the telephone of one of
the senior police officers in the police building. This device enabled the
interception of conversation on this telephone. Dwyer, in the presence of
various police officers, then made a call on the telephone so equipped to Goldman.
At about 12:30 p.m. the same day, Sayers outfitted Dwyer again with a concealed
body pack voice transmitter. He than went to the vicinity of 1240 Bay Street in
Toronto where Goldman’s office was situated and from the transmissions from
Dwyer’s body pack he recorded a conversation of about fifteen minutes’ duration
between Dwyer and Goldman. The tapes and transcripts made of the interceptions
of the call by Dwyer on the telephone from the police office and the
conversation between Dwyer and Goldman at 1240 Bay Street are those which the
Crown adduced in evidence.

During this period, that is, from the time of
the arrest of Dwyer to the conclusion of his activities in Toronto, he was
subjected to detailed questioning by the police. The police said that he was
co-operative, that he was not threatened or offered special inducements, but it
is clear that in return for his co-operation he was leniently dealt with and
his woman friend was not prosecuted. The police officers were closely
cross-examined and certain conflicting evidence was brought out. However, the
trial judge who heard the evidence and saw the witnesses over a period of some
six days said:

Fundamental to this aspect of the Crown’s
argument is the issue of consent, one of the principal issues upon which
counsel have joined. Did Dwyer consent to the interception and if so, was that
consent real and valid? Considerable evidence was given from which Dwyer’s
attitude and his state of mind may be assessed during the course of preparatory
steps taken for the interception as well as during and following the
interception. Each officer who had any significant contact with Dwyer at these
critical times appears to have given evidence. I have been satisfied by the
Crown that there is no evidence to support Mr. Levy’s suggestion that
Dwyer’s consent was the result of actual or threatened force, coercion, duress
or any similar conduct on the part of the authorities.

Dwyer was a person of some recorded
criminal reputation and was found in constructive possession of a

[Page 1003]

substantial amount of counterfeit money. In
the result, he was prosecuted upon a relatively minor offence, was released
upon his personal bond without restriction. He was sentenced in Judges’
Chambers, a procedure acknowledged as extraordinary by one of the American
officers who testified. He received what might be interpreted as a sanction
inappropriately lenient to both his conduct and his previous criminal record.
The prosecution of his woman companion was held in abeyance. No charges were
contemplated in Ontario. The evidence contains vague but unmistakeable
reference to some form of agreement in which leniency was to be exchanged for
Dwyer’s cooperation.

The only reasonable inference on all of the
evidence is that Dwyer was in fact persuaded by promise of leniency to
cooperate with the police in the interception.

And later:

I am accordingly prepared to find that the
Crown has satisfied me that Dwyer in fact gave real and valid consent to the
interception although undoubtly persuaded to do so by promises of leniency
given him by the police.

It is evident that the trial judge understood
the importance of the issue before him. It is evident as well that he was not
blind to the fact that Dwyer co-operated with the police out of selfish motives
in exchange for leniency but he nevertheless considered that an effective and
acceptable consent had been given. I am not prepared, on my reading of the
evidence, to disturb that finding.

The Court of Appeal, while differing in the
result because of its interpretation of s. 178.16  of the Criminal Code , was
also of this view. Brooke J.A. said:

Turning first to Mr. Levy’s submission
that the trial judge erred in making his finding that Dwyer gave a real and
valid consent. It is important to recognize, that in cases such as this one,
where the person who would normally be the principal witness was not present,
and gave no evidence, while the issue and degree of proof remain the same,
extra caution is required by the Court in testing the evidence presented. After
all, the only witnesses were police witnesses whose conduct was very much in
issue and it remained unchallenged, save as tested by cross-examination. In
this case Mr. Levy quite correctly refers to the finding by the learned
trial judge,

[Page 1004]

that Dwyer was undoubtedly persuaded to
consent to the interception by promises of leniency by the police as a finding
against the credibility of police witnesses who repeatedly stated that Dwyer
had been promised nothing. Mr. Levy refers to the significant instance in
Toronto where Dwyer had lied to the police and led them to a false meet which
was quite the contrary to co-operation. He draws our attention to the fact that
for some unstated reason Dwyer then became sincere in his co-operation after
police accusations of deceit and an attempt to use them. Counsel submits that
there must at least have been coercion or something more than mere promises of
leniency. He contends that one finding against the credibility of police
witnesses should cast doubt on the whole affair.

Considering all of the evidence and
proceeding with the caution I have referred to, I find no reason to say the
learned trial judge was wrong on the evidence before him in making the finding
that he did. It is clear from the beginning that Dwyer set out to co-operate
and achieve his freedom with the least punishment possible. His co-operation
was the means through which he sought to minimize the seriousness of his
position that he knew could attract a very heavy penalty. The evidence of the
events which took place in Florida is consistent only with this view.

He continued, after referring with approval to
the words of Stark J. in R. v. Rosen[5], at p. 569, where that judge expressed the
view that consents of this nature given upon the advice of counsel were not
vitiated by motives of self-interest and said:

I think the passage quoted was apt and the
view expressed correct. The consent anticipated by the statute is a real
consent. It is not consent exhorted by coercion but rather free from coercion given
by a party with knowledge of the circumstances and appreciation of his
position. Only such a consent could have been contemplated by Parliament to
exempt the wilful interception of private communications from the criminal
offence created by s. 178. Only such a consent could have been contemplated by
Parliament as a condition of admissibility in evidence of the interception of
the private communication. The onus is on the Crown to prove consent beyond a
reasonable doubt as a condition precedent to admissibility.

[Page 1005]

I see no reason on this evidence to doubt
the judgment of the learned trial judge and to hold that what was co-operation
as a result of promises of leniency became co-operation as a result of coercion
following Dwyer’s efforts to deceive the police in Toronto. His attempt failed.
They told him so and no doubt were angered by his conduct but that is not
coercion. Significantly, his purpose did not change and so he co-operated. He
consented. He agreed to dupe his alleged confederate into a discussion so that
the police could listen in and record what was said. That was enough.

He considered the consent valid and effective.

I am in agreement with this disposition of the
issue of consent. The consent given under s. 178.11(2) (a) must be
voluntary in the sense that it is free from coercion. It must be made knowingly
in that the consentor must be aware of what he is doing and aware of the
significance of his act and the use which the police may be able to make of the
consent. The test to be applied in considering the admissibility of a statement
or confession made by an accused person in custody to police officers or others
in a position of authority is not applicable here. The word “voluntary” in the
sense in which it applies to a consent to intercept or to admit evidence under
Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  should not be considered in the
restricted sense of the rule in the Ibrahim[6] case. A consent under s. 178.11(2) (a)
is a valid and effective consent if it is the conscious act of the consentor
doing what he intends to do for reasons which he considers sufficient. If the
consent he gives is the one he intended to give and if he gives it as a result
of his own decision and not under external coercion the fact that his motives
for so doing are selfish and even reprehensible by certain standards will not
vitiate it. In my opinion, on the evidence adduced in this case, the consent
was a valid consent and was legally effective for its intended purpose, that
is, the procuring of admissible evidence for use in Goldman’s trial.

[Page 1006]

The word coercion requires some definition in
this context. The consent must not be procured by intimidating conduct or by
force or threats of force by the police, but coercion in the sense in which the
word applies here does not arise merely because the consent is given because of
promised or expected leniency or immunity from prosecution. Inducements of this
nature or compulsion resulting from threats of prosecution would render
inadmissible a confession or statement made by an accused person to those in
authority because the confession or statement could be affected or influenced
by the inducement or compulsion. Different considerations arise, however, where
a consent of the kind under consideration here is involved. I refer to Rosen
v. The Queen[7] where
the question was considered and where I said for the Court:

In such a case, very different
considerations apply. The consenter is consenting to the use in evidence of
tapes or other recordings which have been previously recorded and which he
cannot change. He is not agreeing to make a statement which he could invent nor
to give evidence in futuro which he could colour in the hope of reward
or benefit. The nature of the evidence which will be admitted as a result of
his consent is already fixed and determined and cannot be affected by the
circumstances of the consent.

The final point taken by the appellant was that
the trial judge and the Court of Appeal erred in admitting the signed consent
of Dwyer into evidence because it contravened the hearsay rule—Dwyer not having
been called at trial to give evidence. Brooke J.A. for the Court of Appeal saw
no merit upon this point and disposed of it with these words

But he also gave his consent in writing.
His consent was an issue of fact in these proceedings and could be proved like
any other fact in issue. I think the evidence of P.C. Sayers and others was
admissible to prove the fact that Dwyer had consented and that he signed the
consent above set out. That evidence was not hearsay as is contended by
Mr. Levy.

[Page 1007]

While I am inclined to agree with that
statement, I do not consider it necessary to deal with the point. It will be
observed that the consent referred to in s. 178.11(2) (a) may be express
or implied. As I understand the argument of Crown counsel, he did not place his
case upon a specific consent under the section. His argument was that there was
an implied consent which would suffice to render the intercepts admissible. On
all the evidence, it seems clear to me that the Crown discharged the onus upon
it and raised on the evidence a clear implication of consent.

In summary then, it is my opinion that while the
provisions of Part IV.1 apply to the conversations between Dwyer and Goldman
for the reasons given earlier, the effect of s. 178.16(1) (a) is to
deprive the appellant of any protection in the circumstances of this case. I
would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Non-capital murder—Defence of
insanity not pleaded but put to the jury by trial judge—“Disease of the
mind”—“Appreciating the nature and quality of an act or omission”—Charge to the
jury—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 16, 613, 618(1)(a).

The appellant, an out-patient at the Hamilton Psychiatric Hospital, was charged
with the murder of Denise Hobbs, an in-patient at the same institution. After a
party at the hospital, the appellant unsuccessfully attempted to have sexual
intercourse with the victim then choked her. Appellant had a lengthy
psychiatric history. The defence of insanity was not raised at the trial. A
psychiatrist was called by the defence to seek to establish that the accused
did not have the capacity to form an intention to kill. In answer to a question
put by the trial judge the psychiatrist testified that he did not think that
the accused was suffering with a disease of the mind. None the less, the trial
judge dealt with this issue of insanity in her charge to the jury. The jury
found the appellant guilty of non-capital murder and he was sentenced to life
imprisonment. An appeal was dismissed without written reasons, Dubin J.A.
dissenting on the grounds that there was misdirection and non-direction
amounting to misdirection in the trial judge’s charge to the jury on the
defence of insanity. The appellant then appealed to this Court pursuant to s.
618(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  on the basis of a dissent in the
Court of Appeal on a question of law.

Held (Martland
and Pratte JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Dickson, Beetz, Estey and McIntyre JJ.: Section 16  of the Criminal
Code  does not set out a test of insanity but, rather, the criteria to be
taken into account in determining criminal responsibility. The question raised
by this appeal is whether there was evidence upon which a properly charged jury
could conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that the appel-

[Page 1151]

ty. The second is that there was
non-direction, amounting to misdirection, in failing to relate the evidence of
the psychiatrist on the issue as to whether the appellant was able to
appreciate the nature and quality of the act. As to the first criticism, the trial
judge did not treat the opinion of the psychiatrist that the accused was not
suffering from a disease of the mind as determinative. The jury was told that
if there was other evidence on this issue they were entitled to weigh it. There
was no evidence to show a state of natural imbecility. As to the second
criticism, it is desirable to stress the fact that the appellant elected not to
raise the question of insanity: The trial judge cannot be criticized for not
relating the evidence given in relation to another issue, to an issue which had
not been raised at trial. The evidence does not establish an incapacity to
appreciate the nature and quality of the appellant’s act. The onus of proving
that he was not sane rested upon the appellant.

There was no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice. The Court of Appeal was entitled to dismiss the appeal of the
accused under ss. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], dismissing, by a
majority, the appeal by the appellant from his conviction of non-capital
murder. Appeal allowed, Martland and Pratte JJ. dissenting.

Alan D. Gold, for the appellant.

Edward F. Then, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Dickson, Beetz,
Estey and McIntyre JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—Issues fundamental to the design and
range of the “insanity defence” and to notions of responsibility in our
criminal justice system are before the Court in this appeal.

[Page 1152]

The case opens up the broad and difficult
question of the obligation of a trial judge to charge on insanity in
circumstances where an accused has a lengthy psychiatric history, but the
medical evidence is that he does not suffer from “disease of the mind”.

The appellant, Gary Albert Cooper, was charged
with the murder of one Denise Hobbs, at the time an in-patient at the Hamilton Psychiatric Hospital. The appellant was an out-patient at the same institution. There
was evidence that the appellant had been drinking during the day of October 8,
1975. That evening he arrived at a regularly scheduled dance held at a nearby
church for patients of the hospital and there met Denise Hobbs with whom he was
acquainted. At his invitation, the two left the dance to seek a bottle of pop
and cigarettes. Ultimately, after an unsuccessful attempt at sexual
intercourse, the appellant choked the deceased. The cause of death was
asphyxiation by strangulation.

At trial, counsel for the defence directed
argument to raising a doubt on the issue of intent and did not plead the
“defence” of insanity. None the less, the trial judge, Madame Justice Van Camp,
charged the jury on insanity, though in a manner vigorously challenged in this
appeal. The jury found the appellant guilty of non-capital murder and an appeal
was dismissed without written reasons, Dubin J.A. dissenting. At a later date
Mr. Justice Dubin delivered lengthy reasons in dissent.

Section 16  of the Criminal Code  does
not set out a test of insanity but, rather the criteria to be taken into
account in determining criminal responsibility. The section reads:

16. (1) No person shall be convicted of an
offence in respect of an act or omission on his part while he was insane.

(2) For the purposes of this section a
person is insane when he is in a state of natural imbecility or has disease of
the mind to an extent that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.

[Page 1153]

(3) A person who has specific delusions,
but is in other respects sane, shall not be acquitted on the ground of insanity
unless the delusions caused him to believe in the existence of a state of
things that, if it existed, would have justified or excused his act or
omission.

(4) Every one shall, until the contrary is
proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane.

The question raised by this appeal is whether
there was evidence from which a properly charged jury could conclude, on a
balance of probabilities, that the appellant had disease of the mind to an
extent that rendered him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of
the act of which he was charged, or of knowing that it was wrong. “Wrong” means
legally wrong: Schwartz v. The Queen[2].
Before turning to the evidence adduced at trial, it will be convenient to
consider this question at some length, for it raises two distinct legal issues
fundamental to our defence of insanity under s. 16(2). First, the meaning to be
ascribed to the phrase “disease of the mind”, and second, the interpretation to
be given the words “incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an
act”.

I

Disease of the Mind

Let me say by way of commencement that, to date,
the phrase “disease of the mind” has proven intractable, and has eluded
satisfactory definition by both medical and legal disciplines. It is not a term
of art in either law or psychiatry. Indeed, Glanville Williams (Textbook of
Criminal Law at p. 592) says that the phrase is no longer in medical use.
“It is a mere working concept, a mere abstraction, like sin.” (Wily &
Stallworthy, Mental Abnormality and the Law (1962) at p. 20.) Although
the term expresses a legal concept and a finding is made according to a legal
test, psychiatric knowledge is directly linked to the legal conclusion, for
medical testimony forms part of the evidence on which the trier of fact must
reach its decision. But medical and legal perspectives differ. The divergence
in the two philosophies is identified

[Page 1154]

by Jerome Hall in “Psychiatry and Criminal
Responsibility” (1956) 65 Yale L.J. 761 at p. 764:

“…we can easily perceive the perspective
that psychiatry, and especially psycho‑analysis, draws from them (the
sciences). Since it purports to the rigorously scientific, it takes a
determinist position. Its view of human nature is expressed in terms of drives
and dispositions which, like mechanical forces, operate in accordance with the
universal laws of causation…

Its view (the criminal law) of human nature
asserts the reality of free choice and rejects the thesis that the conduct of
normal adults is a mere expression of imperious psychological necessity”.

Even medical experts are not given to agreement
when asked to define “disease of the mind”. In “The Concept of Mental Disease
in Criminal Law Insanity Tests” (1965-66) 33 U. Chic. L.R. 229, H.
Fingarette illustrates the diversity in approach taken by psychiatric
authorities in the quest for a definition of mental disease. He cites the
following medical views, at p. 232-3:

(1) There is no such medical entity as
mental disease, or we would do well not to use the phrase.

(2) Mental disease is psychosis but not
neurosis.

(3) Mental disease is any significant and
substantial mental disturbance, or is any condition at all which is authoritatively
dealt with by the psychiatrist or physician treating mental conditions.

(4) Mental disease means substantial social
maladaptation or incompetence or both as judged by legal criteria.

(5) Mental disease is the failure to
realize one’s nature, capacities or true self.

He observes, at p. 238, that in spite of the
inability of medical science to assist the law in reaching or agreeing upon a
precise definition, the law is responsive to its different needs:

Nevertheless, it is crucial for our
purposes to realize that the whole affair is initiated for legal purposes, that
the definition is authoritatively formulated by lawmakers,

[Page 1155]

and that the fundamental grounds justifying
the enterprise are largely non-medical.

In R. v. Kemp[3], an oft-cited decision, the primary issue
was whether arteriosclerosis came within the meaning of “disease of the mind”.
Devlin J. agreed that there was an absence of medical opinion as to the
categories of malfunction properly to be termed “diseases of the mind”, and rejected
the idea that for legal purposes, a distinction should be made between diseases
physical and mental in origin. In his view, arteriosclerosis is a disease of
the mind and can provide a defence to a criminal charge. He reviewed the
relationship between medical evidence and the legal conclusions to be drawn
therefrom:

...Doctors’ personal views, of course, are
not binding on me. I have to interpret the rules according to the ordinary
principles of interpretation, but I derive help from their interpretations
inasmuch as they illustrate the nature of the disease and the matters which
from the medical point of view have to be considered in determining whether or
not it is a disease of the mind, (at p. 406)

In Bratty v. A.-G. for Northern Ireland[4], Lord Denning agreed that the question of
whether an accused suffers from a disease of the mind is properly resolved by
the judge. He acknowledged that “the major mental diseases, which the doctors
call psychoses are clearly diseases of the mind”, and that “any mental disorder
which has manifested itseft in violence and is prone to recur is a disease of
the mind”. (at p. 412)

In the Report of the Royal Commission on
Capital Punishment (Eng.) (1949-1953), one finds a useful
contribution to the discussion of what is meant by the phrases “mental disease”
and “disease of the mind”. The Report reads at p. 73:

…For us, therefore, mental disease is only
one part of mental disorders of all kinds, and broadly corresponds to what are
often called major diseases of the mind, or psychoses; although it may also
arise in cases, such as those of epilepsy and cerebral tumour, which are not
ordinarily regarded by doctors as psychotic. Among the psychoses are the
conditions known as schizophrenia,

[Page 1156]

manic-depressive psychoses, and organic
disease of the brain. Other conditions, not included under this term, are the
minor forms of mental disorder—the neurotic reactions, such as neurasthenia,
anxiety states and hysteria—and the disorders of development of the
personality—psychopathic personality. We are aware that this classification
will not be unconditionally endorsed by all psychiatrists, and that some would
prefer to include under the term “disease of the mind” even the minor
abnormalities we have referred to. We believe, however, that the nature of the
distinction we have drawn will be clear to them, and will be acceptable to them
as the basis for a discussion of criminal responsibility.

The classification advanced was arbitrary and
recognized as being one which would not be acceptable to all psychiatrists. The
passage cited makes it abundantly clear that “disease of the mind” can mean
different things to different psychiatrists. To some, for example, it may
include such things as neurasthenia, anxiety states, hysteria, and psychopathic
personality. Others would exclude such disorders from the definition. It is
equally manifest that in law some mental states may be recognized as possibly
being within the definition, although, medically speaking, a psychiatrist might
not so regard them. Hardening of the arteries is one example (R. v. Kemp,
supra); psychomotor epilepsy (R. v. O’Brien[5]) is another. Thus to pose to a psychiatrist
the bald question “Is D suffering from a disease of the mind?” and require a
bald “yes” or “no” response really tells nothing because one is left in the
dark as to the legal criteria applied.

Support for a broad and liberal legal
construction of the words “disease of the mind” will be found in the writings
of the renowned jurist, formerly Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Owen Dixon,
who wrote:

The reason why it is required that the
defect of reason should be “from disease of the mind”, in the classic phrase
used by Sir Nicholas Tindal, seems to me no more than to exclude drunkenness,
conditions of intense passion and other transient states attributable either to
the fault or to the nature of man. In the advice delivered by Sir Nicholas
Tindal no doubt the words “disease of

[Page 1157]

the mind” were chosen because it was
considered that they had the widest possible meaning. He would hardly have
supposed it possible that the expression would be treated as one containing
words of the law to be weighed like diamonds. I have taken it to include, as
well as all forms of physical or material change or deterioration, every
recognizable disorder or derangement of the understanding whether or not its
nature, in our present state of knowledge, is capable of explanation or
determination. (A Legacy of Hadfield, M’Naghten and Maclean, (1957) 31 A.L.J. 255 at 260). (Emphasis added.)

To the learned authors of Smith & Hogan Criminal
Law (4th Ed) (1978) “It seems that any disease which produces a malfunction
is a disease of the mind”. (at p. 164)

Recently, in Canada, the Ontario Court of Appeal contributed judicial direction in this
area of the law, in the cases of R. v. Rabey[6] and R. v. Simpson[7], both of which were decided subsequent to
the trial of the appellant. Judgment in Rabey postdates the decision of
the Court of Appeal in the case at bar and is presently on appeal to this Court
on an issue unrelated to those raised herein. Mr. Justice Martin, who
wrote for the Court in both Rabey and Simpson, was not among the
members of the Court who heard the Cooper appeal.

Simpson has
greater significance for the present appeal. There, the accused appealed the
finding of not guilty by reason of insanity on two charges of attempted murder.
The facts, which indicate two incidents of stabbing, are not remarkable. As
framed by Martin J.A., the issue was whether a personality disorder is a disease
of the mind within the meaning of s. 16 of the Code. He held that,
notwithstanding the psychiatric evidence, the question raised must be resolved
as a question of law. But the legal position, as I understand it, is properly
expressed in the following passage:

The term “disease of the mind” is a legal
concept, although it includes a medical component, and what is meant by that
term is a question of law for the judge… It is the function of the psychiatrist
to describe the

[Page 1158]

accused’s mental condition and how it is
considered from the medical point of view. It is for the judge to decide
whether the condition described is comprehended by the term “disease of the
mind”. (at p. 349-50)

As a matter of practice, the trial judge can
permit the psychiatrist to be asked directly whether or not the condition in
question constitutes a disease of the mind. Concerning the controversy over the
classification of a “psychopathic personality”, Martin J.A. found implicit
recognition in Canadian and British authorities for the proposition that such a
disorder can constitute a disease.

The general principles, not in issue on the
further appeal to this Court, were reiterated by Mr. Justice Martin in R.
v. Rabey. Disease of the mind is a legal term. It is within the province of
the judge to determine what mental conditions are within the meaning of that
phrase and whether there is any evidence that an accused suffers from an
abnormal mental condition comprehended by that term. More importantly, he held
that if there is any evidence the accused did suffer such a disease in legal
terms, the question of fact must be left with the jury.

I think Mr. Justice Dubin correctly
characterizes the decision in Simpson as holding that “personality
disorder” has been recognized as “being capable of constituting a ‘disease of
the mind,”. I share his view that “there is no reason to give a narrow or
limited interpretation to the term ‘disease of the mind,”. Admittedly, in Simpson,
both of the psychiatrists stated that the personality disorder there in
question did or could constitute a disease of the mind. While Martin J.A. in
that case had little difficulty finding evidence that the appellant suffered
from a “disease of the mind”, the case foundered upon the second segment of s.
16(2). It should also be kept in mind that Simpson presented an odd
situation in which the Crown successfully raised the insanity defence against
the wishes of the accused, who appealed the verdict of not guilty by reason of
insanity.

What is interesting in these two cases for our
purposes is the maintenance of a clear distinction

[Page 1159]

between the weight to be given medical opinions
expressed in evidence, however relevant, and the task of the trial judge to
form an independent conclusion as to whether the mental condition falls within
the legal concept.

In summary, one might say that in a legal sense
“disease of the mind” embraces any illness, disorder or abnormal condition
which impairs the human mind and its functioning, excluding however,
self-induced states caused by alcohol or drugs, as well as transitory mental
states such as hysteria or concussion. In order to support a defence of
insanity the disease must, of course, be of such intensity as to render the
accused incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the violent act or
of knowing that it is wrong.

Underlying all of this discussion is the concept
of responsibility and the notion that an accused is not legally responsible for
acts resulting from mental disease or mental defect. The principle was
expressed long ago in Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 1 (2d ed. 1724) where
it is said:

The Guilt of offending against any Law
whatsoever, necessarily supposing a wilful Disobedience can never justly be
imputed to those, who are either uncapable of understanding it, or of
conforming themselves to it…(at p. 1)

With great respect, in the case at bar the trial
judge, in her charge to the jury, which I will discuss shortly, fell into error
in that she confused the legal issue of whether the appellant’s disorder could
constitute disease of the mind with the factual issue of whether the appellant
was suffering from disease of the mind at the relevant time. Once the evidence
is sufficient to indicate that an accused suffers from a condition which could
in law constitute disease of the mind, the judge must leave it open to the jury
to find, as a matter of fact, whether the accused had disease of the mind at
the time the criminal act was committed. The more troublesome issue, where a
defence of insanity has been pleaded, concerns the second criterion to be
applied in determining criminal responsibility. As Martin J.A. pointed out in Rabey:

[Page 1160]

In many, if not most cases involving the
defence of insanity, the question whether the accused suffered from a disease of
the mind is not the critical issue; the pivotal issue is whether a condition
which, admittedly, constitutes a disease of the mind rendered the accused
incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act or knowing that it
was wrong. (at p. 474)

The real question in this case, in my view, is
not whether the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind, but whether
he was capable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act. The second
question ought to have been left to the jury in clear terms.

II

Appreciate

In contrast to the position in England under the M’Naghten rules, where
the words used are “knows the nature and quality of his act”, s. 16 of the Code
uses the phrase “appreciating the nature and quality of an act or
omission”. The two are not synonymous. The draftsman of the Code, as
originally enacted, made a deliberate change in language from the common law
rule in order to broaden the legal and medical considerations bearing upon the
mental state of the accused and to make it clear that cognition was not to be
the sole criterion. Emotional, as well as intellectual, awareness of the
significance of the conduct, is in issue. The Report of the Royal Commission
on Law of Insanity as a Defence in Criminal Cases (McRuer Report) (Canada,
Queen’s Printer, 1956) contains a useful discussion on the point:

The word “appreciating”, not being a word
that is synonymous with “knowing”, requires far-reaching legal and medical
consideration when discussing Canadian law. It had its origin in the Stephen
Draft Code. Not infrequently judicial reference is made to the New Oxford
Dictionary for the definition of words used in Canadian statutes. The New
Oxford Dictionary gives five different uses of the word “appreciate”, depending
on the context. The one applicable to this statute is

“2. To estimate aright, to perceive the
full force of.

[Page 1161]

b. esp. to be sensitive to, or sensible of,
any delicate impression or distinction.

Until the truth of any thing…be
appreciated, its error, if any, cannot be detected.”

An examination of the civil law of England
and Canada shows that there is an important difference between “know” or
“knowledge” on the one hand and “appreciate” or “appreciation” on the other
when used and applied to a given set of circumstances. This is best illustrated
by the principles of law underlying those cases in which the maxim volenti
non fit injuria is involved. There is a clear distinction between mere
knowledge of the risk and appreciation of both the risk and the danger. (at p.
12)

To “know” the nature and quality of an act may
mean merely to be aware of the physical act, while to “appreciate” may involve
estimation and understanding of the consequences of that act. In the case of
the appellant, as an example, in using his hands to choke the deceased, he may
well have known the nature and quality of that physical act of choking. It is
entirely different to suggest, however, that in performing the physical act of
choking, he was able to appreciate its nature and quality in the sense of being
aware that it could lead to or result in her death. In the opinion of the
medical expert who testified at the trial, the appellant could have been
capable of intending bodily harm and of choking the girl, but not of having
intended her death.

Our Code postulates an independent test,
requiring a level of understanding of the act which is more than mere knowledge
that it is taking place; in short, a capacity to apprehend the nature of the
act and its consequences. The position in law is well expressed in the McRuer
Report at p. 12:

Under the Canadian statute law a disease of
the mind that renders the accused person incapable of an appreciation of the
nature and quality of the act must necessarily involve more than mere knowledge
that the act is being committed, there must be an appreciation of the factors
involved in the act and a mental capacity to measure and foresee the
consequences of the violent conduct.

[Page 1162]

It should be noted that the issue of
appreciation of the nature and quality of the act was not before this Court in Schwartz
v. The Queen (supra). The sole issue was the meaning of the word “wrong”.
The decision in Schwartz should not be taken as authority for the
proposition that “appreciating” the nature and quality of an act is synonymous
with “knowing” the physical character of that act.

The test proposed in the McRuer Report, which
I would adopt, (save for deletion of the word “fully” in the fourth line) is
this:

The true test necessarily is, was the
accused person at the very time of the offence—not before or after, but at the
moment of the offence—by reason of disease of the mind, unable fully to
appreciate not only the nature of the act but the natural consequences that
would flow from it? In other words was the accused person, by reason of disease
of the mind, deprived of the mental capacity to foresee and measure the
consequences of the act? (at p. 13)

The legally relevant time is the time when the
act was committed.

In R. v. O’Brien (supra) Ritchie J.A.
referred to the McRuer Report and stated at pp. 301-2: “If an accused
person is to be deprived of the protection of s. 16 , he must, at the time of
committing the offence, have had an appreciation of the factors involved in
his act and the mental capacity to measure and foresee the consequences of it.”
(His emphasis.)

In the Simpson decision, Martin J.A.
offered the view that s. 16(2) exempts from liability an accused who, due to a
disease of the mind, has no real understanding of the nature, character and
consequences of the act at the time of its commission. I agree. With respect, I
accept the view that the first branch of the test, in employing the word
“appreciates”, imports an additional requirement to mere knowledge of the
physical quality of the act. The requirement, unique to Canada, is that of perception, an ability
to perceive the consequences, impact, and results of a physical act. An accused
may be aware of the physical character of his action (i.e., in choking) without
necessarily having the capacity to appreciate that, in nature and quality, that
act will result in the death of a

[Page 1163]

human being. This is simply a restatement,
specific to the defence of insanity, of the principle that mens rea, or
intention as to the consequences of an act, is a requisite element in the
commission of a crime.

III

Evidence—non-medical

It will now be convenient to turn to the
evidence because, as I understand him, counsel for the Crown concedes that if
there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury on the question of insanity,
the trial judge failed to deal adequately with insanity in her charge and
effectively withdrew the insanity defence from the jury.

It is important to observe, at the outset, that
the trial judge did charge the jury on insanity although, as I have stated, the
defence was not raised by the appellant’s counsel. The judge felt the evidence
sufficient to warrant an instruction to the jury on the issue, whatever the
posture of defence counsel. In my opinion, she was correct in doing so, having
regard to the evidence upon this issue, which I will now endeavour to
summarize.

The Crown adduced evidence that before 7:00 p.m.
on the night in question, a resident nursing assistant present at the church
where the dance was being held, addressed the appellant upon his arrival. The appellant
had a “faraway”, “dazed”, “blank” look in his eyes and appeared unresponsive.
The appellant’s father testified that he received a phone call at approximately
8:15 p.m. from his son, who
seemed excited and out of breath. The appellant, trying to speak quickly, was
having difficulty “getting his words out”. He told his father, “Hello dad, how
are you doing? Dad I just killed somebody…on James
 Street mountain steps… I was coming down the steps and
thought somebody was following me… I jumped over the railing… I jumped out and
grabbed hold of them”. In response to the question (“is he dead?”) the
appellant said, “Yes. I felt for a heartbeat and a pulse. I dragged her out in
the bushes”.

[Page 1164]

Constable Slote of the Hamilton Police Force
testified that he received a call at 8:39 p.m. from the appellant, who attested
to having “just seen a murder”. The conversation was recorded on the police
dispatcher:

I seen somebody kill a girl. I don’t know
if he dragged her in the bushes or not… I was just coming down the James Street
stairs and I heard a screams (sic), I don’t know, I’d just turned around and
seen somebody grab some girl and drag her into the bushes… I don’t know, you
know, if she’s dead or alive or what.

Slote considered it a crank call, as there was a
lack of emotion in the caller’s voice. A police cruiser despatched to the phone
booth and thereafter to Cooper’s apartment, was unable to locate the appellant.

The deceased was discovered the following
morning, October 9, in the bushes near the James Street steps. Her upper body
and part of her face were covered by her jacket and her brassiere, unfastened,
was in place. Her slacks, also unfastened, were about her hips. Soil and leaves
adhered to her back. There was no evidence of sexual intercourse. However, she
had been undressed and an attempt made to redress her. There was no evidence of
struggle and the deceased was neither battered nor badly bruised. Her
strangulation was by hand, without the use of a rope or weapon.

At 11:35 a.m. that morning, the appellant was
apprehended and detained by police officers until 12:10 p.m., at which time an
interrogation commenced. At the time he was true to his story of having seen a
murder committed by another person. To both officers in attendance, the appellant
appeared mentally slow and spoke slowly.

The officers left the appellant to continue the
investigation and returned to the interview at 7:25 p.m. Upon confronting him
with additional facts and indicating that he would be charged with murder, the
appellant said, “Hold it. Hold it. I didn’t mean to kill her”. The appellant
offered to give a full statement (which I have paraphrased, except where in
quotes):

I went to the church and bumped into Denise
Hobbs. “...we went for a walk down the James Street stairs

[Page 1165]

then I kissed her then she wanted to go
back up then I grabbed her around the throat and choked her with my hands. Then
I got scared and tried to feel for a pulse or something and got none so I ran
downstairs for a phone booth.

...we were in the bushes standing up, I
kissed her and I grabbed her around the throat and choked her I was afraid
she would go back and tell them I was kissing her.” (Emphasis added)

The appellant did testify at trial. Defence
counsel attempted to establish a lack of intention to commit the murder,
supported by the evidence of the appellant’s intoxication and susceptibility to
abnormal behavior.

The appellant was 31 years of age. His father,
Albert Cooper, testified that as a young boy the appellant was subject to
seizures, convulsions and sudden mood changes—he would quickly become very
excited for no apparent reason, and then quickly calm down. Often the appellant
would seem to be “far away” and “his mind was elsewhere”. Sometimes he would
have blackouts and fall down. He heard things which were not there to be heard.
His condition worsened as he got older. The appellant was first seen by
psychiatrists at age seven. At age ten or twelve, he was treated for auditory
hallucinations. He experienced a great deal of difficulty at school and at age
16 had progressed only as far as the 5th grade at a trade school. He held a
series of menial jobs from which he was discharged after short periods of time.
In his testimony, the appellant stated that he had been admitted to the Hamilton
Psychiatric Hospital in 1965 (it was in fact in 1962) and remained until 1971,
after which time he was an outpatient and still had contact with the doctors at
the hospital. He married in April, 1972 (he had met his wife at the
Psychiatric hospital) and had two children. He returned to the hospital for a
period of fifteen days in 1974.

IV

Evidence—medical

Medical evidence relating to the appellant’s
mental and behavioral problems is offered in the

[Page 1166]

testimony of Dr. Sim. I think it useful to break
down his evidence, reorganized slightly from the sequence in which it was given
at trial, as follows:

(a) General history—

The hospital records indicated that the
appellant was first seen at age seven, as he was failing at school and
exhibited disturbing behavior. A condition of borderline mental deficiency was
diagnosed at that time. He was re-examined at age eight and described as being
wild, hyperactive and having a poor sense of reality. At ten, an abnormal EEG
reading was discovered upon examination for his problem of narcolepsy (sleep
seizures). At eleven, further IQ testing disclosed borderline deficiency and at
age twelve, the appellant was treated by a psychiatrist for mental confusion
and auditory hallucinations. He was admitted to the Hamilton Psychiatric
Hospital as a young man and diagnosed as “without psychosis—borderline
intelligence”. In 1965 his condition was described as “psychosis with mental
deficiency”. Dr. Sim described psychosis in this way:

“Psychosis, basically, involves a break with
reality in which the person may or may not be confused, and have other symptoms
like hallucinations of his hearing, seeing, tasting, or smelling, feeling
things that are not actually around, or can have such symptoms as delusions.
And delusion is usually described as a false belief which cannot be changed by
persuasion and/or reason.”

In 1965 there was a bizarre episode wherein the
appellant was reported to have swallowed part of a lighter, his belt buckle,
buttons from his clothing and a zipper from his trousers. In 1967 he swallowed
part of a disassembled cigarette lighter. In 1967 he was re-diagnosed as
“mental deficiency without psychosis”. Since, he has also been described
medically as having “personality disorder, anti-social type with borderline mental
retardation”. Other evidence indicated that the appel-

[Page 1167]

lant was released from the hospital in 1971 and
returned subsequently in 1974 for a period of 15 days.

(b) Electroencephalogram—

Dr. Sim reviewed the medical history of abnormal
brainwave patterns (electrical discharges from the brain). All such tests (from
March 1962 to June 1974) showed generalized abnormality, and in one or two of
the EEG tests, there was abnormality in brainwaves from the temporal lobe.
However, the EEG tests were suggestive, at most of an “epileptic diathesis”
(tendency or propensity to epilepsy, without necessarily resulting in
seizures). Dr. Sim could only say that it is possible that Cooper could
experience epileptic seizures.

(c) Intelligence—

The appellant’s intellectual ability was
measured on a number of occasions according to the full-scale intelligence
quotient. His IQ ranged from 69 to 79, and was usually between 71 and 79. The
normal IQ reading is in the region of 90 to 110. In Dr. Sim’s opinion, the appellant
is of borderline intelligence (i.e., bordering on retardation or classification
as an “outright mentally defective person”). The change-over is at an IQ of 70.
To quote the doctor:

“…in summary (that) we are dealing with a
male who has shown evidence of breaking with reality in the past. He has a long
history of unstable, aggressive and inadequate behavior. He was unable to
adjust at school, academically, socially, economically, in his marriage. He has
some brainwave abnormalities which could more readily make this man more
irritable and aggressive by alcohol than a person without these abnormalities.
He is also of limited intelligence, having a borderline to high-grade defective
level of IQ. Putting all this together, and bringing the stress—the fact that
he was under stress financially and so forth, plus the alcohol and under the
circumstances which are described as having occurred at the time, it would be
my opinion that he would be in such a state of clouded consciousness that he
would not be able to form the intent to kill.”

[Page 1168]

Dr. Sim agreed with the diagnosis of other
psychiatrists of March 26, 1976, that the appellant had “personality disorder,
mixed type, showing schizoid, anti-social, explosive and inadequate features,
borderline mental retardation”. However, on direct examination, Dr. Sim was of
the view that at the time of the killing, the appellant was not suffering from
psychosis and in response to a question posed by the judge, he answered that at
the time of the offence, the appellant was not suffering from a disease
of the mind.

(d) Intention—

Dr. Sim expressed the opinion that although the
appellant probably knew he was causing bodily harm, he was incapable of forming
an intent to kill, and he could not have known that any harm he was causing
might result in death.

At the conclusion of Dr. Sim’s evidence, the
following questions were asked and answers given:

HER LADYSHIP: Dr. Sim, there are two
questions in my mind arising from the evidence that I would like to put to you
for your assistance, if possible.

THE WITNESS: Yes, My Lady?

HER LADYSHIP: The first one is, can you
tell me whether the accused had a disease of the mind?

THE WITNESS: In my opinion, My Lady, at the
time of the alleged offence, I do not think that this man was suffering with a
disease of the mind.

HER LADYSHIP: The second question is this:
I think you said that he had the capacity to form the intent to cause harm?

THE WITNESS: Yes.

HER LADYSHIP: If he had the capacity to
form that intent, would he have the capacity to know that any harm he might
intend would be likely to cause death?

THE WITNESS: No; I do not think that he had
the capacity to know that any harm he was causing might result in death.

V

The charge

The charge on insanity was sketchy in the
extreme. It was introduced with these words:

[Page 1169]

However, I do have to consider one further
defence with you. I would prefer not to, but, as I look at it, it seems to me
that the question will be in your minds and so I must discuss with you the
question of insanity.

and concluded with these words:

With that evidence before you, again it
would seem to me impossible for you to bring in a finding of not guilty by
reason of insanity, but the evidence is yours to consider and it is your
finding.

In the course of the charge on insanity the
following was said:

The reason I have been reluctant to put
this before you but have considered I should is that the evidence of Dr. Sim
was that this man did not have a disease of the mind. However, if there is
other evidence before you, you are entitled to weigh the evidence of Dr. Sim
with the other evidence. The other evidence that you had was the evidence of
his father as to the nature of the convulsions, the mood changes, the far-away
looks, the low I.Q., the rapid speech, the blackouts, the falls, the hearing of
things throughout his early life.

Crown counsel, commenting upon the charge,
objected that it was unnecessary to put the insanity defence to the jury as
that defence was not available to the accused. The judge replied:

I do agree that the charge on insanity was
sparse; little attention was drawn to the evidence. I considered that it had to
be put before the jury. I had hoped that by indicating that the evidence was so
weak that it would not form a major part of their concern.

At the time of sentencing, counsel for the
accused said:

In light of that, My Lady, I think his
problem is more a psychiatric one than a penal system is geared to handle, and
I ask Your Ladyship not to make a recommendation, or, I should say, an order,
beyond the minimum period of ten years.

The judge replied:

I would agree that this is a matter in
which, if there is any provision for psychiatric help, it should be obtained,
and I will endeavour to make such a recommendation.

[Page 1170]

VI

Conclusions

In my opinion, there was evidence sufficient to
require the judge to fully instruct the jury on the issue of insanity. The
judge was of the opinion that that issue should go to the jury. With respect,
the trial judge erred:

(1) in treating Dr. Sim’s reply to the judge’s
isolated question as virtually determinative of the issue of whether the
appellant had a “disease of the mind”. Although in practice it is often
convenient to do so, in strictness a medical witness is not entitled to state
that a particular condition is or is not a disease of the mind, since this is a
legal question. Mental disease is not purely a matter of psychiatric
definition. It is for the jury and not for medical men, of whatever eminence,
to determine the issue. R. v. Rivett[8],
at 94. The entire psychiatric history, if accepted by the jury, was such as
would have entitled the jury to hold that the accused suffered from a disease
of the mind within its legal meaning, regardless of whether one isolates the
personality disorder. Personality disorders such as the appellant displayed at
various stages of his life can constitute a disease of the mind. The real
question before the jury was the extent to which the accused’s appreciation of
the nature and quality of his act was impaired. Included in the evidence on
this point was the evidence of Dr. Sim that the appellant lacked the capacity
to form the intent to cause death;

(2) in failing to review adequately the evidence
bearing upon the insanity issue and in failing to relate the evidence of the
accused’s capacity to intend certain acts to the issue of insanity. The judge
did not analyze the evidence of Dr. Sim or the other evidence as it may have
related to the defence of insanity on the issue of whether the appellant
appreciated the nature and quality of his act. Failure before the jury on the
issues of

[Page 1171]

intent and intoxication did not preclude success
on the issue of insanity. The insanity question should have been put to the
jury in such a way as to ensure their due appreciation of the value of the
evidence. R. v. Laycock[9];

(3) in concluding this portion of the charge in
language which to all intents withdrew from the jury the essential
determination of fact which it was its province to decide. If the issue was to
go to the jury, then, in fairness to the accused, a much more careful charge
was warranted. The issue should have been clearly left with the jury to decide.
On a matter of such importance and having regard to the strong evidence of
personality disorder, s. 613 of the Code should not be applied in this
case.

Before concluding, I should state that
Mr. Justice Dubin discussed at some length “natural imbecility”. I have
refrained from doing so as I believe the present appeal can be decided without
broaching that aspect of the case.

I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.

The following are the reasons delivered by

MARTLAND J. (dissenting)—The appellant
was charged with the murder of Denise Hobbs at the City of Hamilton on October
8, 1975. The fact that he caused her death is not in issue.

At the time of the offence, Denise Hobbs was an
in-patient at the Hamilton Psychiatric Hospital. The appellant was an
out-patient. On the evening in question, he was attending a social function for
hospital patients were he met the deceased whom he had known casually. He had
been drinking during the course of the day. They left the group, at his
suggestion at about 7 p.m., and went to a store where the deceased purchased a
soft drink. Then they walked for about fifteen minutes to an area below the
James Street mountain steps.

[Page 1172]

The appellant asked the deceased to remove her
clothing, which she did. He attempted unsuccessfully to have sexual intercourse
with her. He then grabbed her around the throat and choked her. He reached for
her pulse and found none. The cause of death was asphyxiation by strangulation.

He telephoned his father at about 8 p.m. and
said “Dad, I just killed somebody on the James Street Mountain steps”. He
stated that he was going down the steps, thought someone was following him,
jumped over the railing, then “jumped and grabbed hold of them”. He told his
father that he had checked for a pulse, then “dragged her out in the bushes”.

At about 8:39 p.m., he telephoned the police and
said:

I seen somebody kill a girl. I don’t know
if he dragged her in the bushes or not… I was just coming down the James Street
stairs and I heard a screams (sic), I don’t know, I’d just turned around
and seen somebody grab some girl and drag her into the bushes… I don’t know,
you know, if she’s dead or alive or what.

The body of the deceased was found at the
location described by the appellant. Her clothing was in a state of disarray,
consistent with her having been unclothed and partially reclothed. When
initially questioned by the police, the appellant said he had witnessed a man
attacking a girl, but some hours later in a statement to the police he admitted
having caused her death.

The appellant was thirty-one years of age. He
had a long history of psychiatric treatment, beginning at the age of seven. He
was sporadically under psychiatric care from that age until he was seventeen.
During the years from 1965 to 1971, he was a patient in a mental hospital. He
was readmitted for a period of fifteen days in 1974. In the period from 1971 to
the date of the offence, when he was not an in-patient, he was under
out-patient care.

The defence of insanity was not raised at the
trial. Instead, it was sought to establish through the evidence of a
psychiatrist, Dr. Sim, that the appellant did not have the capacity to
form an

[Page 1173]

intention to kill. Neither counsel for the
appellant nor counsel for the Crown questioned Dr. Sim in relation to the
defence of insanity. Dr. Sim’s evidence was directed solely to the
question of the appellant’s capacity to form an intention to kill. He was not
asked by either counsel whether the appellant was in a state of natural
imbecility or whether his personality disorder was a disease of the mind, or
whether his disorder rendered him incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of his act, or of knowing that the act was wrong.

The following are extracts from Dr. Sim’s
evidence regarding the capacity of the appellant to form the intent to kill:

Q. Did he have the capacity to form the
intent to cause some harm or bodily harm to an individual?

A. Yes; I think he knew, really, that, or
probably knew that.

Q. He had that capacity?

A. Yes.

Q. And in fact didn’t he have the capacity
to form the intent to choke?

A. To choke, yes; but not to kill, the
result.

Q. With all due respect, doctor, you have
admitted that you feel that he had the capacity to form the intent to choke,
yet you say you don’t think he had the capacity to form the intent to kill?

A. I am talking about choke, cutting off
the airway; not to go all the way to death, though.

Q. I accept that distinction. I accept
“choke” means to cut off the airway, to deprive the person of a certain amount
of air but not enough to kill; whereas, “to kill” is to kill?

A. Yes.

Q. I put it to you, aren’t you really
splitting hairs, Dr. Sim, when you say the accused had the capacity to
form the intent to choke, to cut off the airway of an individual, yet didn’t
have the capacity to form the intent to kill?

A. I don’t think so.

…

Q. He did have the capacity to form the
intent to choke, or cut off the airways, but you are saying he didn’t have the
capacity to go all the way; is that correct?

[Page 1174]

A. I think so. I think it boils down that I
think he probably knew he was doing her some harm, but I don’t think he
intended to kill her.

Q. It is the capacity you should be
directed to, doctor.

HER LADYSHIP: Yes, Dr. Sim. If I may
interject, you are not permitted to give your opinion as to whether he intended
to kill; you may only give an opinion as to whether he had the capacity.

THE WITNESS: I am sorry; yes. That is what
I meant; I am sorry.

MR. TAKACH: YOU were talking about
capacity, in any event.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

Q. What I am asking is, what is the
difference in the two capacities?

A. I think you have to be more aware to
have capacity to take life than you do to just put your hands around a person’s
throat and to do them some harm, and be aware of doing some harm.

Q Isn’t this really splitting hairs; aren’t
the issues very fine? Will you go that far with me?

A. Yes, I will.

Q. It is a very fine distinction, will you
not agree?

A. Yes, I think so.

Following the examination, cross-examination and
re-examination of Dr. Sim, he was asked by the trial judge whether the
accused had a disease of the mind, to which his answer was:

In my opinion, My Lady, at the time of the
alleged offence, I do not think that this man was suffering with a disease of
the mind.

In her charge to the jury, the trial judge
carefully reviewed the evidence of Dr. Sim in relation to the appellant’s
capacity to form an intent to kill. Later in her charge, of her own volition,
she proceeded to deal with the question of insanity. Her reason for so doing is
stated as follows:

However, I do have to consider one further
defence with you. I would prefer not to, but as I look at it, it seems to me
that the question will be in your minds and so I must discuss with you the
question of insanity.

[Page 1175]

She then proceeded to instruct the jury with
respect to the law as to the defence of insanity. She went on to say:

The reason I have been reluctant to put
this before you but have considered I should is that the evidence of
Dr. Sim was that this man did not have a disease of the mind. However, if
there is other evidence before you, you are entitled to weigh the evidence of
Dr. Sim with the other evidence. The other evidence that you had was the
evidence of his father as to the nature of the convulsions, the mood changes,
the far-away looks, the low I.Q., the rapid speech, the blackouts, the falls,
the hearing of things throughout his early life.

Now, what you must look to is whether he
was insane at the time of the commission of the offence; not before it and not
after it. There is the evidence of the lack of emotion when he phoned the
police, although it is to be contrasted with the emotion of the phone call to
his father. There is the evidence of the lack of intelligence, the low I.Q.;
there is the evidence of Dr. Sim, apart from disease of the mind, but that
evidence again, it seemed to me, did not show the alternative to a disease of
the mind (namely, a state of natural imbecility), because that evidence, as I
heard it, was that this man’s status was much higher than that; that this man
was on the borderline of mental deficiency; that he would have been mentally
defective at one time when that low reading was given, but that the reading
that he had before him at the time, he would have had to say that he was of
borderline intelligence, and he accepted another alternative definition;
namely, borderline mental retardation.

With that evidence before you, again it
would seem to me impossible for you to bring in a finding of not guilty by
reason of insanity, but the evidence is yours to consider and it is your
finding.

No objection of any kind was made on behalf of
the appellant to the judge’s charge on the issue of insanity and no request was
made for further instruction to the jury in relation to that defence.

The jury returned a verdict of guilty.

The first notice of appeal to the Court of
Appeal for Ontario raised no issue as to the charge to the jury on the matter
of insanity. In a supplementary notice of appeal filed two months later, it was

[Page 1176]

alleged that “the learned trial judge erred in
law in withdrawing the defence of insanity”.

The appellant’s appeal was dismissed by a
majority decision of the Court of Appeal without written reasons. There was a
dissent by Dubin J.A., who filed written reasons later. The formal judgment
states the ground of dissent as being “that there was misdirection and non‑direction
amounting to misdirection in the learned trial judge’s charge to the jury on
the defence of insanity”.

Section 16  of the Criminal Code , which
deals with the defence of insanity, provides as follows:

16. (1) No person shall be convicted of an
offence in respect of an act or omission on his part while he was insane.

(2) For the purposes of this section a
person is insane when he is in a state of natural imbecility or has disease of
the mind to an extent that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.

(3) A person who has specific delusions,
but is in other respects sane, shall not be acquitted on the ground of insanity
unless the delusions caused him to believe in the existence of a state of
things that, if it existed, would have justified or excused his act or
omission.

(4) Every one shall, until the contrary is
proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane.

There are two main criticisms of the charge to
the jury in the dissenting reasons. The first is that there was misdirection,
or non-direction amounting to misdirection, on the issue as to whether the
accused was suffering from a disease of the mind or natural imbecility. The
second is that there was non-direction, amounting to misdirection, in failing
to relate the evidence of Dr. Sim on the issue as to whether the appellant
was able to appreciate the nature and quality of the act.

As to the first criticism, it is said that the
trial judge had treated as virtually determinative the opinion expressed by
Dr. Sim that the appellant was not suffering from a disease of the mind.

[Page 1177]

While the trial judge, whose own question had
evoked Dr. Sim’s opinion, obviously regarded that opinion as being of
great weight, she did not treat it as determinative because, had she so
regarded that opinion, she would not have put the issue of insanity before the
jury. I have cited from the charge the passage in which she expressed
reluctance to put the issue to the jury in the light of Dr. Sim’s
evidence, but, none the less, she went on to tell the jury that if there was
other evidence they were entitled to weigh it.

I agree with the trial judge’s expressed
conclusion that there was no evidence to show a state of natural imbecility.
Dr. Sim’s evidence does not support the existence of such a state.

As to the second criticism that the trial judge
did not relate Dr. Sim’s evidence to the issue as to whether the appellant
was able to appreciate the nature and quality of the act, it is desirable to
stress again the fact that the appellant elected not to raise the question of
insanity and, accordingly, evidence relating to that matter was not adduced.
Dr. Sim was never asked whether, in his opinion, the appellant was capable
of appreciating the nature and quality of his act. The trial judge is
criticized for not relating his evidence, given in relation to another issue,
i.e. the ability of the appellant to form an intent to kill, to an issue which
had not been raised at the trial.

I have already cited the evidence of
Dr. Sim that in his opinion the appellant had the capacity to form the
intent to choke the deceased, i.e. to cut off the airway. He said that the
appellant probably knew he was doing her harm, but “I don’t think he intended
to kill her”.

The distinction made by Dr. Sim between the
capacity to form an intent to kill and the capacity to form the intent to choke
and thus do bodily harm is one of considerable subtlety and Dr. Sim
himself admitted that it was “very fine”. I have doubts as to its validity and
the fact that, in the face of this evidence, the jury convicted the appellant
is some indication that they had similar doubts. But even if that distinction
can be drawn

[Page 1178]

in respect of the issue of intent, it is not, in
my opinion, of assistance as evidence of absence of capacity to appreciate the
nature and quality of the appellant’s act.

Reliance is placed, in the dissenting reasons,
on two passages in Dr. Sim’s evidence as showing that in his opinion the
appellant was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his act. One
of these I have already cited. The other was an answer given to a question by
the trial judge. They are as follows:

Q. What I am asking is, what is the
difference in the two capacities?

A. I think you have to be more aware to
have capacity to take life than you do to just put your hands around a person’s
throat and to do them some harm, and be aware of doing some harm.

…

HER LADYSHIP: The second question is this:
I think you said that he had the capacity to form the intent to cause harm?

THE WITNESS: Yes.

HER LADYSHIP: If he had the capacity to
form that intent, would he have the capacity to know that any harm that he
might intend would be likely to cause death?

THE WITNESS: No; I do not think that he had
the capacity to know that any harm he was causing might result in death.

Both of these passages, as well as the rest of
Dr. Sim’s evidence, were related solely to the issue of intent.
Section 16  of the Criminal Code  is not concerned with intent. It
can only come into operation after it has been determined that an offence has
been committed. Subsection (1) provides that no person shall be convicted
of an offence in respect of an act on his part while he was insane. The “act”
in question here was the choking of the deceased. Subsection (2) provides
that a person is insane if he has a disease of the mind to an extent that
renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an “act”. This
subsection also provides that a person is insane if he did not know that
an act or omission was wrong, but that provision is not relied upon by the
appellant in this case.

[Page 1179]

Dr. Sim’s evidence is that the appellant
had the capacity to form an intent to choke, that he knew that choking entailed
cutting off air and that it involved causing bodily harm. Thus he knew the
nature and quality of the act which he committed. In my opinion, the fact that
Dr. Sim was of the view that the appellant lacked the capacity to know
that the harm which he was consciously inflicting might result in death does
not bring him within the protection afforded by subs. 16(1). He appreciated the
nature of his act, i.e. choking the deceased and he also appreciated the
quality of his act, i.e. the cutting off of her airway.

The only other evidence having relevance to the
question of the appellant’s capability to appreciate the nature and quality of
his act is that of the appellant himself. He did not testify that he did not
appreciate the nature and quality of his act. In giving evidence at trial, he
professed to have no recollection of the strangulation. He said that he had
kissed the deceased, that she had removed her clothes, that they both laid on
the ground, but that he was unsuccessful in having sexual intercourse with her.
They both got up, but he said he could not recall what happened next. He could
not remember putting his hands on her neck, but could recall her going limp and
falling.

The appellant was able to give a complete and
detailed account of his activities both before and after the death of the
deceased. It is only the very narrow time span of the actual strangulation
which he alleged he could not recall.

As previously noted, after the death of the
deceased, the appellant telephoned his father and said that he had just killed
somebody. After his arrest, he gave a statement to the police and had no
difficulty in recalling what had occurred. The following portion of the
statement relates to the events leading up to the death and immediately after:

...There was a dance going on, or getting
ready for a dance then I didn’t stay I came outside and I bumped into Denise
Hobbs, she was talking to a patient, a guy

[Page 1180]

named Dennis. Then I asked Denise Hobbs if
she wanted to go for a walk and she said yes and we went for a walk down the
James Street stairs then I kissed her then I (sic) she wanted to go back
up then I grabbed her around the throat and choked her with my hands. Then I
got scared and tried to feel for a pulse or something and got none so I ran
downstairs for a phone booth.

Question. How did she get in the bushes? We
were in the bushes standing up, I kissed her then I grabbed her around the
throat and choked her I was afraid she would go back and tell them I was
kissing her.

It was admitted that this statement was made
voluntarily.

The evidence of the appellant does not establish
an incapacity to appreciate the nature and quality of the appellant’s act. His
evidence as to lack of memory of the strangulation is inconsistent with his
voluntary statement to the police, with some of his other testimony and with
his actions after the event.

The onus of proving that the appellant was not
sane at the time he killed the deceased rested upon him. The appellant did not
seek to adduce evidence to fulfill that onus, because the defence of insanity
was never raised at the trial. The psychiatrist whom he called as a witness
testified that he did not have a disease of the mind.

The trial judge was obviously in doubt as to
whether to charge the jury on the defence of insanity, but elected to do so.
She charged the jury on the law applicable to that offence and no objection was
taken by counsel for the appellant in respect of that charge.

The chief complaint against the charge is that
there was a failure to relate the evidence of Dr. Sim to the question of
the appellant’s capacity to appreciate the nature and quality of the act. But
for the reasons already outlined, such a review would have had to point out
that, according to Dr. Sim, the appellant did appreciate that he was
choking the deceased, cutting off the airway and that he was causing bodily
harm. The verdict given by the jury on the main issue of guilt is some

[Page 1181]

indication that they did not accept
Dr. Sim’s “very fine” distinction between capacity to form the intent to
choke and capacity to form the intent to kill.

In the light of all these circumstances, it is
my opinion that, even if the jury had been charged in the manner suggested in
the dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal, the verdict of the jury would
necessarily have been the same. There has been no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice and the Court of Appeal was properly entitled to dismiss
the appellant’s appeal from conviction under subs. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the
Criminal Code .

PRATTE J. (dissenting)—I would dismiss

Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 676(1) (a).

 

                   The accused was
involved in an accident and was charged with two counts of dangerous driving
causing death and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm.  The
accused had been driving to work and was late.  As he approached the
intersection of a major highway, he looked, thought the highway was clear, came
to a ""rolling stop"" at the stop sign and proceeded onto the highway. 
His vehicle collided with another vehicle, severely injuring the driver
and killing the two passengers.  At trial, the accused was acquitted.  The
trial judge found that he was clearly negligent, but that he was not guilty of
the offences charged.  The Crown appealed under s. 676(1)  of the Criminal
Code  and the majority of the Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal
and ordered a new trial. Under s. 676(1), the jurisdiction of
the Court of Appeal was limited to a question of law alone.  After
reviewing the evidence and the facts as found by the trial judge, the
majority concluded that the trial judge had erred in law by failing to
consider all relevant evidence and by failing to ask herself whether the manner
of the accused's driving considered in its totality amounted to dangerous
driving.  The majority relied on passages taken from R. v. B. (G.),
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 57, which identify three grounds which may constitute an error
of law by a trial judge in assessing the facts as they apply to the law: 
(1) an acquittal based on an erroneous conclusion of reasonable doubt
constitutes a question of law where the trial judge has erred as to the legal
effect of undisputed or found facts rather than the inferences to be drawn from
such facts; (2) a question of law may also arise when the trial judge
misdirects himself with respect to the relevant evidence or (3) when he failed
to consider the evidence in its totality.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be allowed and
the acquittal restored.

 

                   While both the
majority and minority proceeded on the basis that the trial judge did not err
in law in respect of the principles relating to the definition of dangerous
driving, the majority concluded that the trial judge erred in her application
of those principles to the facts of the case.  The three principles relied
upon by the majority, however, did not justify the setting aside of the
acquittal in this case.  First, this was not a case of undisputed facts to
which a correct interpretation of the law could be applied so as to yield a
different result.  The majority disagreed with the facts to which the trial
judge directed herself and with her inferences from those facts.  Second, there
was no misdirection in respect of any legal principle.  The trial judge
referred to the evidence which in her opinion was important.  This was part of
the weighing process, and stressing one item over another was not the result of
the misapplication of any legal principle.  Third, there is no basis for
concluding that the trial judge failed to consider the evidence in its totality
in arriving at the ultimate result.  In sum, the majority of the Court of
Appeal had a different theory of the facts and the inferences that could be
drawn from those facts.  While the majority's view of the facts might be
preferable, this was a matter for the trial judge to determine and, absent an
error of law, the Court of Appeal should not have interfered.

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

                   Sopinka
J. -- The appellant,
Kevin Martie Morin, was charged with two counts of dangerous driving causing
death and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, under
ss. 249(4)  and 249(3)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 
respectively.  The charges arose out of an accident which occurred at
approximately 7:30 a.m. on February 28, 1990, near Spruce Grove, Alberta, at
the intersection of Campsite Road, a secondary highway, and Highway 16X, a four
lane divided highway.

 

                   The appellant was
driving a Ford Bronco southbound on Campsite Road.  The intersection where the
collision occurred is controlled by a stop sign for vehicles entering Highway
16X from Campsite Road.  The appellant was driving to work and was late.  He
looked as he approached Highway 16X and thought the westbound portion of
Highway 16X was clear.  He came to a ""rolling stop"" at the stop sign
and proceeded to enter Highway 16X.  Unfortunately his vehicle collided with a
white Dodge three quarter ton pick‑up truck being driven by Mr. René
Laflamme westbound in the right-hand lane.  No evasive action was taken by
either driver and a severe impact resulted.  The pick‑up truck driven by
Mr. Laflamme rolled sideways after being struck.  Mr. Laflamme was
seriously injured and the two passengers in his vehicle, John Guy Sauvé and
Paul Guy Lalonde, were fatally injured after being thrown from the vehicle.

 

                   At the time of the
collision, the sun was just rising.  Considerable evidence was led as to the
effect that this may have had on the appellant's ability to see oncoming
traffic.

 

                   The trial judge
found the appellant to be negligent, but not guilty of the offences charged on
the basis that the ""necessary criminal element"" required for a
conviction for dangerous driving under the Criminal Code  was not present
in his conduct.  The majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set
aside the acquittal and directed a new trial on all three charges:  (1991), 117
A.R. 36, 2 W.A.C. 36, 30 M.V.R. (2d) 92.  The appeal to this Court is as of
right pursuant to s. 691(2) (a) of the Criminal Code .

 

Judgments Below

 

Alberta Court of Queen's Bench

 

                   Foster J. commenced
by describing the events of the morning on which the collision occurred.  She
found that the appellant ""looked as he approached Highway 16X, thought the
westbound portion was clear, came to a rolling stop at the stop sign, and
proceeded"".  She reviewed the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Schmidt
who had been travelling immediately behind the appellant's vehicle on Campsite
Road for some distance.  The Schmidts saw the appellant come to a rolling stop
as he approached the stop sign.  They then saw the appellant proceed onto the
highway and saw the collision occur.

 

                   The trial judge
indicated that considerable evidence had been adduced as to what effect the sun
may have had on the appellant's ability to see.  Mr. Schmidt, who was
driving immediately behind the appellant, said the sun did affect him in that
it made him look more than once for traffic on Highway 16X.  There were three
westbound vehicles on Highway 16X.  Mrs. Schmidt, a passenger, did not see
the vehicle that was struck until the point of collision; however, she saw the
two vehicles which were following it.

 

                   The trial judge
made the following findings:

 

                   I
find the accused as he approached Highway 16X believed that he had a clear view
and believed that the westbound portion of the highway was free of traffic.  He
was wrong.  Whether he failed to see the vehicles because of the sun, the
glare, the dawn lighting, the colour of the vehicles, or any combination of
these, I do not know.  He was clearly negligent.  Charges could no doubt have
been laid against him under the Highway Traffic Act; but I do not, in these
circumstances, see the necessary criminal element in his conduct required for a
conviction of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code .

 

The charges were therefore dismissed.

 

Alberta Court of Appeal (1991), 30 M.V.R. (2d) 92

 

                   Fraser J.A.
(Laycraft C.J.A. concurring)

 

                   The Crown appealed
the appellant's acquittal pursuant to s. 676(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  on the basis that the trial judge had erred in law.  After reviewing
the evidence and the facts as found by Foster J., Fraser J.A. (now Chief
Justice of the Court of Appeal of Alberta) concluded that the trial judge had
committed such an error.  In her view, Foster J. failed to consider relevant
evidence, in particular, to what extent the appellant's failure to stop at the
stop sign contributed to the accident.  She stated that although Foster J. dealt
with the effect of the sun as the appellant approached the intersection,
she did not address whether the location of the sun would have affected his
vision had he chosen to stop at the intersection.  She noted that based on the
appellant's own statement, he was aware that the sun was affecting his
visibility and yet knowing this, he proceeded without stopping onto a major
four lane divided highway.  Under these circumstances, she considered it open
to the trial judge to have concluded that the appellant's driving was such as
to constitute dangerous driving.

 

                   Fraser J.A. thus
concluded that by failing to consider all relevant evidence and by failing to
ask herself whether the manner of the appellant's driving considered in its
totality amounted to dangerous driving, the trial judge had erred in law.  She
stated in part:

 

(1)""...
it was open to the trial Judge to have inferred that the sun would not have
presented a visibility problem had Morin stopped and looked to the east along
the highway before leaving the stop sign.  This issue was not addressed by the
trial Judge"" (p. 96).

 

(2)The
trial judge failed to consider the evidence in its totality.  Accordingly, the
trial judge failed to appreciate or disregarded material evidence.  Under these
circumstances, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the appellant's
driving was such as to constitute dangerous driving.

 

                   In support of this
conclusion, Her Ladyship relied on the following passages from R. v. B. (G.),
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 57, at pp. 71, 72 and 77:

 

                   An
acquittal based on an erroneous conclusion of reasonable doubt constitutes a
question of law where the trial judge has erred as to the legal effect of
undisputed or found facts rather than the inferences to be drawn from such
facts.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   A
question of law may also arise, it seems to me, when the trial judge misdirects
himself or herself with respect to the relevant evidence.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   A
review of the trial judge's decision in this case makes it clear that he failed
to consider the evidence in its totality.  This was the result of misdirection
and brought the matter within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.

 

                   Foisy J.A.
(dissenting)

 

                   Foisy J.A. set out
the two arguments made by the Crown, namely, that the learned trial judge erred
in law (a) in failing to apply the proper test to the offence of dangerous
driving, and (b) in failing to appreciate or in completely disregarding
relevant evidence.  In dealing with the first ground, he noted that the trial
judge found that the appellant was ""clearly negligent"".  In order to
appreciate exactly what Foster J. meant by these words, Foisy J.A. reproduced
the entire trial judgment.  He noted that just before rendering her decision,
the legal elements which must be proven by the Crown on the charge of dangerous
driving were reviewed extensively before the trial judge, and that she was
referred to the decisions of Peda v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 905, R.
v. Binus, [1966] 4 C.C.C. 193 (Ont. C.A.), and R. v. Fotti (1978),
45 C.C.C. (2d) 353 (Man. C.A.), aff'd [1980] 1 S.C.R. 589, among others.  Foisy
J.A. concluded that the trial judge was aware of the principles involved.  Her
judgment was to be interpreted as meaning that the Crown had simply not proven
dangerous driving beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

                   With respect to the
second ground of appeal, Foisy J.A. concluded that the trial judge had not
failed to appreciate nor had she disregarded relevant evidence.  He stated that
it was not useful to dwell upon what might have happened had the appellant
stopped at the stop sign and taken a more careful look.  He reviewed the facts
and concluded that the driving came close to constituting dangerous driving;
however, he was not prepared to disturb the trial judge's finding that the
offence of dangerous driving was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

                   Foisy J.A. would
therefore have dismissed the appeal.

A Question of Law Alone

 

                   The jurisdiction of
the Court of Appeal herein was limited to a question of law alone.  Both the
majority and minority proceeded on the basis that the trial judge did not err
in law in respect of the principles relating to the definition of dangerous
driving.  The majority concluded, however, that the trial judge erred in her
application of those principles to the facts of the case.  In this regard the
majority relied on the passages referred to above in R. v. B. (G.), supra,
which identify three grounds which may constitute an error of law by the trial
judge in assessing the facts as they apply to the law.

 

(1)  Legal Effect of
Undisputed Facts

 

                   If a trial judge
finds all the facts necessary to reach a conclusion in law and in order to
reach that conclusion the facts can simply be accepted as found, a Court of
Appeal can disagree with the conclusion reached without trespassing on the fact‑finding
function of the trial judge.  The disagreement is with respect to the law and
not the facts nor inferences to be drawn from the facts.  The same reasoning
applies if the facts are accepted or not in dispute.  In this situation, the
court can arrive at the correct conclusion in law without ordering a new trial
because factual issues have been settled.  Examples of this type of error of
law can be found in Belyea v. The King, [1932] S.C.R. 279, Ciglen v.
The Queen, [1970] S.C.R. 804, Poitras v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R.
649,  Johnson v. The Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 160, and Fotti v. The
Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 589.

 

(2)  Misdirection as to
Evidence

 

                   R. v. B. (G.), supra, proceeded on the basis
(conceded by the Crown at p. 72) that failure by the trial judge to direct
himself to all the evidence is only a question of law if based on legal
misdirection.  In this regard, reliance on Harper v. The Queen, [1982] 1
S.C.R. 2, must be treated with caution.  In that case the appeal was from
conviction and the trial judge treated as irrelevant the evidence of several
witnesses without an adverse finding with respect to their credibility.  This
was held to be an error of law by this Court.  See Estey J. at p. 14. 
That decision must be applied in light of the principle that in an appeal from
conviction, the Court of Appeal has the duty of reviewing the evidence in order
to determine whether the conviction is unreasonable and cannot be supported by
the evidence.  In an appeal from acquittal, the Court of Appeal has no such
power.  See Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Ltd. v. The Queen, [1969]
S.C.R. 221.

 

                   Failure to
appreciate the evidence cannot amount to an error of law unless the failure is
based on a misapprehension of some legal principle.  Any statement to the
contrary in R. v. B. (G.) must be considered in light of the assumption
made by Wilson J. that the statement to this effect by Marshall J.A. in R.
v. Roman (1987), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Nfld. C.A.) was correct.  That
assumption was incorrect by reason of the fact that this Court, differently
constituted, had reversed Roman prior to the decision in R. v. B.
(G.).  See [1989] 1 S.C.R. 230.  Nevertheless, R. v. B. (G.) was
correctly decided on the basis of a misdirection in law.  As pointed out in the
concurring reasons of McLachlin J., the trial judge erred in law in respect of
the issue of time.  This error affected his overall assessment of the
evidence.  This error was noted as well by Wilson J. and must be taken as the
basis for her judgment.

 

(3)  Totality

 

                   In R. v. Morin,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, we decided that the trial judge erred in instructing the
jury that they should examine individual pieces of evidence and subject them
piecemeal to the criminal standard.  We held that the criminal standard was to
be applied to the ultimate issue and not in the weighing of individual pieces
of evidence.  With respect to the weighing of evidence, the manner in which the
jury assessed individual pieces of evidence was not a question of law in respect
of which the trial judge was required to instruct the jury.  The basic
requirement was that the jury was to be instructed that they must consider the
whole of the evidence and determine on that basis whether the guilt of the
accused had been established beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Morin, supra,
at pp. 361‑62.

 

                   A jury does not
record its deliberations, and its assessment of individual pieces of evidence
is not known.  On the other hand, a trial judge will frequently record in his
or her reasons the process by which the decision is reached, or at least some
of it.  There is, however, no obligation in law on a trial judge to record all
or any specific part of the process of deliberation on the facts.  To apply Morin,
supra, as a basis of review of a trial judge's findings of fact whenever
the reasons for judgment fail to deal with a particular piece of evidence, or
the inference from such evidence would require a trial judge to record each
piece of evidence and his or her assessment of it.  This would be a
misapplication of Morin to the trial process when the trial is by judge
alone.  A trial judge must consider all of the evidence in relation to the
ultimate issue but unless the reasons demonstrate that this was not done, the
failure to record the fact of it having been done is not a proper basis for
concluding that there was error in law in this respect.

 

Application to This Case

 

                   In my opinion, none
of the principles outlined above entitled the majority of the Court of Appeal
to reverse the acquittal in this case.  First, this was not a case of
undisputed facts to which a correct interpretation of the law could be applied
so as to  yield a different result.  The majority disagreed with the facts to
which the trial judge directed herself and with her inferences from those
facts.  This is evident from the observations of the majority that ""it was
open to the trial Judge"" to take a different view of the facts.  It is
also evident from the fact that a new trial was ordered.  A new trial would not
have been necessary if all necessary findings of fact had been made.

 

                   Second, there was
no misdirection in respect of any legal principle.  The trial judge referred to
the evidence which in her opinion was important.  This was part of the weighing
process, and stressing one item over another was not the result of the
misapplication of any legal principle.  Finally, there is no basis for
concluding that the trial judge failed to consider the evidence in its totality
in arriving at the ultimate result.  In summary, the majority of the Court of
Appeal had a different theory of the facts and the inferences that could be
drawn from those facts.  While I might agree that the majority's view of the
facts is preferable, this was a matter for the trial judge to determine and,
absent an error of law, the Court of Appeal should not have interfered.  In
accordance with the order made at the conclusion of the appeal, the appeal is
allowed and the acquittal restored.

acquittal restored.

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 
 The charge 
 
The appellant was charged with two offences as follows:
DAC 15869/96
 
You,
 
Gunasegeran s/o Pavadaisamy, m/36 yrs
 
NRIC No S1350216A
 
are charged that you, on or about 30 June 1994, at a place in Singapore, did cheat, to wit, by deceiving one Tomoyuki Suzuki into believing that you would transfer on or about 30 June 1994 the ownership of a certain property, to wit, a motor-car bearing registration no EG 2037 G, to the said Tomoyuki Suzuki and by such manner of deception you dishonestly induced the said Tomoyuki Suzuki to deliver a sum of $60,568 to you, being the purchase price of the said property inclusive of the transfer of ownership, an act which he would not have done had he not been so deceived and you have thereby committed an offence under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
And
 
DAC 15870/96
 
You,
 
Gunasegeran s/o Pavadaisamy, m/36 yrs
 
NRIC No S1350216A
 
are charged that you, sometime in the month of June 1995, at ESH Credit Pte Ltd, 11 East Coast Road #02-30, Odeon Katong Shopping Complex, Singapore, did fraudulently use as genuine the following documents:
1 ESH Credit Pte Ltd `Hire Purchase Act, Cap 125, Second Schedule, Summary of Financial Obligations under Proposed Hire Purchase Agreement` dated 2 June 1995; 
2 Notice of Hire-Purchase undated; 
3 ESH Credit Pte Ltd `Application for Hire Purchase/Bill of Sale` undated; and 
4 ESH Credit Pte Ltd `Hire Purchase Agreement` dated 2 June 1995, all purporting to be signed by one Tomoyuki Suzuki, knowing or having reason to believe the same to be forged and you have thereby committed an offence under s 471 and punishable under s 465 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 2.The appellant claimed trial on both counts. The district judge convicted him on both charges and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of six months for each offence, both of which were to run concurrently. The appellant appealed against the decision of the judge. I dismissed the appeal and at the same time enhanced the sentence on the first charge to one of 12 months` imprisonment, to run concurrently with the sentence for the second charge, which I left untouched. I now give my reasons.
 3.
 The case for the prosecution 
 
The prosecution called eight witnesses, including the complainant, Tomoyuki Suzuki (PW1) himself, who alleged that the appellant had cheated him as well as forged certain documents using his signature. Their case thus relied heavily on the evidence given by him. In addition, their other main witness was Yvonne Lim (PW2), the officer of ESH Credit Pte Ltd (ESH) who dealt with the appellant and PW1. The prosecution alleged that the appellant had, without the consent of PW1, remortgaged to ESH a car, which he had originally sold to PW1, in return for a loan. They alleged that the appellant had fraudulently used forged documents to obtain this loan from ESH for his own benefit.
 4.The case for the prosecution was as follows: PW1 was a Japanese national working as a project manager in Singapore. He came to work in Singapore sometime in early May 1994. A month later, in June 1994, he decided to buy a car. He was introduced to the appellant, who at that time was the mechanic of his company. The appellant showed him a secondhand 1977 model Mercedes Benz (the car). PW1 test drove the car, was happy with it, and after some bargaining with the appellant, agreed on a price of $60,000 for its purchase. A few days later, the appellant faxed PW1 a letter containing the details of the car and the terms of purchase. This letter stated the total price payable, including the transfer fee and insurance for the car. The total amount came out to be $60,568.
 5.PW1 paid the appellant for the car on 30 June 1994. The car was thus delivered to him together with a receipt acknowledging payment. After this transaction, the appellant informed PW1 that the car would be transferred into his name immediately. But before this could be done, PW1`s passport, driving licence and employment pass were needed. PW1 gave these documents to the appellant. PW1 also asked about the `red book` for the car, but was told by the appellant that the `red book` system was no longer in use in Singapore. It has since been established that this `red book` referred to the log book for the car. PW1 was not informed that, at that time when he bought the car, it was still under a hire-purchase scheme taken out by the appellant some time ago. As far as he was concerned, he did not feel that there was anything amiss. He had paid for the carand now had possession of it. Further, there was a receipt given to him by the appellant, something which he thought would prove that he was the rightful owner of the car. He therefore expected the appellant to effect the transfer of the car to his name immediately.
 6.It was only in June 1995, almost a year later, when a friend of PW1 told him that every car should have a log book. According to his friend, without a log book, there would be difficulty selling the car in the future. At that material time, PW1 still had no idea that the log book his friend was talking about was actually the `red book` which he had asked the appellant for previously. Nevertheless, he called the appellant and asked for the return of the car`s log book. The appellant agreed. PW1 pestered the appellant several times, but each time the appellant came up with a different excuse for not producing the log book.
 7.In September 1995, nearly 15 months after PW1 had purchased the car, he went personally to the appellant`s office. It appeared that PW1 was upset at the continual delay and the reluctance of the appellant to return the log book. It was only then, accordingly to PW1, that the appellant confessed for the first time that he had borrowed some money using the log book. PW1 testified that the appellant told him that his partner had absconded with the money which he paid for the car and which was meant to repay a loan which the appellant had borrowed. The appellant then promised that he would personally settle the loan and return PW1 the car`s log book. PW1 gave him one month to do so. To keep the appellant to his promise, an undertaking was signed by him in favour of PW1.
 8.The log book was never returned to PW1. Sometime in February 1996, the car was suddenly towed away. PW1 was told by the person who came to tow away his car that the car was being taken away because he had failed to repay his loan. PW1 thereupon made a police report at the police station claiming that he had been cheated by the appellant.
 9.Upon his return to his office later that same afternoon, he telephoned ESH, the hire purchase company on whose instructions the car was being towed away. He spoke to Yvonne, subsequently identified as PW2 in the trial below. PW2 faxed PW1 some documents which showed that ESH had a right to the car and referred PW1 to some signatures which were supposed to be his. PW1 protested that he had not signed those documents. At that moment, he realised for the first time that his name had been forged to obtain a loan for the car. Subsequently, PW1 called the appellant, who said he would settle the loan. On 11 March 1996, PW1 asked the appellant for another undertaking that he would settle the loan . The appellant agreed. However, after a series of faxes between the two of them as to this undertaking, it was still not signed as the amount owing to ESH was not known. Two days later, upset that the appellant had continually done nothing, PW1 called the appellant to accompany him to ESH`s office to settle the loan.
 10.At ESH`s premises, PW1 was shown the documents relating to the hire purchase of the car. He insisted that he had not signed any of the documents which authorised the remortgage of the car in return for a loan being granted. PW1 was also shown the log book, where he saw his name, although he failed to see when the car was transferred into his name. Accordingly to PW2, while at ESH`soffices, the appellant told PW1 that he had been cheated by his partner. His partner had taken out a loan for the car on behalf of PW1 without anyone`s knowledge. The appellant thus asked PW1 for time to settle the loan. He paid four instalments there and then, representing repayment up to the ninth instalment, in addition to the repossession fees and storage fees. As for the remaining outstanding amount, at the appellant`s request, PW1 gave him a further grace period of six months to settle it. This was despite ESH`s insistence that the full loan should be repaid. PW2 also testified that PW1 was told that, if he wanted the car back, he had to sign an undertaking confirming that the signatures on the hire purchase forms which he alleged to be forged were his. PW1, anxious to get back his car, agreed. The appellant also signed an undertaking that he would settle the ESH outstandings within six months. This was done in the presence of PW2. The car was then released to PW1. The judge noted that, at the commencement of the trial, the log book of the car was still in the possession of ESH.
 11.As for the testimony of PW2, other than what occurred when PW1 and the appellant went to ESH`s premises on 13 March 1996, her evidence related to the request for the loan for PW1`s car. She stated that a car broker, Gana Prakasam (PW7), had approached ESH for a car loan sometime in May 1995. It was ESH`s normal procedure and practice that PW7 take out the loan forms or documents for his customer to sign. Blank forms were therefore given to PW7 to obtain the relevant customer`s signature. Having obtained PW1`s signature, PW7 brought back to ESH the identity card of the appellant, the ex-owner of the car, and PW1`s passport, driving licence, work permit card and valid insurance certificate. PW2 further admitted she signed as a witness to the execution of the loan by PW1 even though she had neither seen him nor witnessed his execution of the documents. The loan was subsequently approved, but, due to a discrepancy between the loan quantum purportedly requested by PW1 and the settlement sum required to discharge the hire purchase loan originally taken out by the appellant, the loan could not be released immediately. After some delay, the loan by ESH was disbursed by a payment to Yong Trading Co Pte Ltd (Yong Trading), the original hire purchase company, to settle the appellant`s original hire purchase loan. The log book was released to ESH and the car transferred to PW1`s name. This was on 2 June 1995. PW2 also testified that, when she was processing the loan documents, she had compared PW1`s signatures in the loan documents to those in his passports and they had matched.
 12.In early 1996, default was made in the repayment of the loan instalments. ESH therefore took the necessary steps to repossess the car in February 1996. It was then that PW1 called ESH and protested that he had not taken out any loan using his car. PW1 subsequently visited PW2 at ESH`s premises when the appellant agreed to settle the loan on behalf of PW1. In September 1996, the appellant stopped paying the remaining outstanding loan to ESH. At the start of the trial in the lower courts, the amount outstanding was $7,031.
 13.The prosecution brought in Ng Gek Kwee (PW 3), the Department of Scientific Services (DSS) officer who compared the signatures on the ESH loan forms and the specimen signatures which PW1 had provided. Her evidence was that there were significant differences in the size, slant, formation and relative alignment of letters between PW1`s specimen signatures and his signatures on theESH loan forms. In her opinion, PW1`s signatures on the ESH loan forms were forged, even though the specimen signatures of PW1 were given some 12 to 18 months after the ESH documents had been executed.
 14.Yong Khoon Fah (PW4) was the prosecution`s fourth witness. He was the director of Yong Trading, the finance company from which the appellant had obtained a hire purchase loan to purchase the car which he subsequently sold to PW1. PW4 told the court that the appellant had obtained a $30,000 loan repayable in 48 monthly instalments in June 1993 to purchase the car. The appellant was not a good paymaster and frequently defaulted on his payments. In 1994, the company even had to repossess the car twice in three months. When ESH disbursed PW1`s loan to Yong Trading to settle the appellant`s outstanding balances with them, Yong Trading was about to repossess the car for a third time due to further arrears in the appellant`s hire purchase instalments.
 15.Lee Keng Gin and Rajendran Krishnasamy, PW5 and PW6 respectively, were former partners of the appellant in his car repair workshop, Tropicana Motor Workshop. As for PW5, he became a partner in May 1993. He invested a total of $90,000 in the workshop before deregistering himself as a partner in September 1994 as the business was not profitable. The appellant had signed a document stating that he would repay PW5 for the capital he put into the workshop. Although he was a senior dealer with a securities firm by occupation, he visited the workshop frequently and observed that both business and turnover were good. He was however told that there was a debt collection problem. He did not know that anyone had misappropriated any moneys from the workshop, nor did he know of any worker called Ramachandran, the person whom the appellant blamed for misappropriating the money which PW1 had paid for the car.
 16.As for PW6, he confirmed that he and PW5 were partners. While PW5 was a sleeping partner, he helped with errands in the workshop. Again, he confirmed there was no one called Ramachandran working in the workshop. He also did hear about the appellant selling a Mercedes Benz to a friend. As far as he knew, this was not uncommon as he knew the appellant bought and sold cars from time to time.
 17.PW7 was Gana Prakasam, the car broker who arranged for the ESH loan for PW1 on the appellant`s instructions. He gave evidence and confirmed that the appellant was his personal friend. In May 1995, the appellant told him that one of his customers, namely PW1, wanted a car loan. He thus brought the loan forms to the appellant`s workshop in Bukit Merah. He was supposed to meet PW1, but PW1 never turned up. He therefore left the forms with the appellant after waiting for more than an hour. A few days later, when he went back to collect the forms, they had already been signed. He also collected the appellant`s identity card and PW1`s passport and other relevant documentation. Since PW1 was a foreigner, the appellant agreed, according to ESH`s regulations, to be his guarantor for the loan. Subsequently, he handed the documents to ESH and the loan was consequently approved and disbursed. After that, he returned the documents to the appellant. All this while, he never saw PW1.
 18.Finally, there was Staff Sergeant Zainal Adam (PW8), the investigation officer. He denied the appellant`s contentions that PW1 did not wish to proceed with his complaint against the appellant, or that it was he himself who had pursuedthe prosecution against the appellant because the appellant had lodged a complaint against him. He also disagreed that the appellant had been co-operative in the investigations.
 19.
 The defence`s submission of no case to answer 
 
At the close of the prosecution case, counsel for the appellant submitted there was no case to answer on both charges. It was argued that the elements of the offences under ss 420 and 471 of the Penal Code had not been made out. As for the first charge, it was argued that there was no fraudulent intention to deceive PW1 on the part of the appellant. In fact, if anyone had committed an offence, it was Ramachandran, the person whom the appellant alleged had misappropriated the money for the car. In any event, the appellant`s immediate representation as regards the immediate transfer of the car was made after the moneys for the car had been paid by PW1. Thus PW1 was never induced to hand over $60,568 to the appellant.
 20.In relation to the second charge, counsel for the appellant submitted that there was no evidence that the signatures of PW1 on the ESH loan documents were forged. The court was urged to disregard PW3`s evidence. Further, the appellant did not and could not have known that the signatures of PW1 in the loan documents were forged. The documents had passed through three other individuals, namely PW2, PW7 and Ramachandran, all of whom had accepted them as genuine. Even PW1 had admitted to the authenticity of his signatures on ESH`s loan documents by verifying them in the presence of PW2.
 21.The judge dismissed the submissions by the appellant`s counsel. Having regard to the law in this area, she reminded herself that all she had to do was to satisfy herself that some evidence, not being inherently incredible, had been adduced in respect of each of the ingredients of the charge against the appellant: 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
; [1980_1981] SLR 73.
 22.On the prosecution`s first charge, assuming PW1`s evidence was true, his evidence was that when he bought the car and paid the appellant, the transfer of the ownership of the car would be made to him. In the judge`s mind, although the appellant only told PW1 that he would transfer the car into PW1`s name after he had paid for it, he never meant what he said. The judge felt that the appellant`s conduct gave rise to a justifiable suspicion that he had intended to cheat PW1 and in fact did so. First, he failed to disclose that the car was still under hire purchase in the appellant`s name. In other words, before the transfer of the car could be effected, this hire purchase loan must be repaid back, otherwise PW1 could never obtain full ownership of the car. Then, the appellant lied when he told PW1 there was no `red book` system for the transfer of the car. In any event, PW1 did not get the ownership of the car until almost a year later, and this was when ESH granted PW1 a loan using his car as a mortgage. PW1 was kept in the dark and had no knowledge of this loan. The judge therefore held that a prima facie case for cheating under s 420 had been made out.
 23.As for the prosecution`s second charge, the judge held that there was direct evidence from both PW1 and PW3 that the signatures of ESH`s loan documents had been forged. The judge was also of the opinion that the appellant knew orought to have known that PW1`s signatures on the ESH loan forms were forged, since he had told PW1 so in the presence of PW2 in ESH`s premises. Further, the circumstances in which the loan documents were signed were suspect. Again, she felt that a prima facie charge had been made out.
 24.The judge therefore satisfied herself that there was a case to answer on both charges. She thus called the appellant to enter on his defence on both counts.
 25.
 The defence 
 
The appellant`s defence against the two charges was straightforward. In essence, he pushed all the blame on to his worker, one Ramachandran, whom he said he had given the money PW1 paid for the car to. It was Ramachandran who subsequently misappropriated the money, and the appellant had nothing to do with it. Further, he alleged that Ramachandran had, without his knowledge, forged PW1`s signatures in order to obtain a loan from ESH.
 26.The defence of the appellant proceeded along the following lines: the appellant was introduced to PW1 sometime in June 1994. PW1 wanted to buy a car, and the appellant brought a Mercedes Benz to show him. It was not established at that time whether PW1 was told the car belonged to the appellant or not. After test driving the car, they agreed orally on a price of $60,000. That same day, the appellant faxed PW1 a letter setting out the details of the car and the terms of the purchase. The appellant also claimed he faxed another letter containing the details of the car in the car`s log book. PW1 made no mention of this second fax at all.
 27.At his request, the car was delivered to PW1 a week before payment. According to the appellant, he was paid $25,000 in cash and $35,000 by cheque, with an additional $568 in cash for effecting the transfer and insurance. $413 was then returned to PW1, when it was made known to the appellant that he wanted to take out his own insurance. The appellant then stated that he also asked for PW1`s passport, work permit and driving licence in order to effect the transfer. He claimed that he made it known to PW1 that the car was still under hire purchase, thus he needed about a week before the transfer could be sorted out.
 28.The next day, the appellant called Yong Trading to check on his outstanding balances on the hire purchase of the car. He was told that it was somewhere in the region of $24,000. Consequently, a few days later, he gave instructions to his worker, Ramachandran, to go to Yong Trading to settle his outstanding debts in exchange for the car log book. He stated that he gave $25,000 in cash to Ramachandran to carry out these instructions. The appellant also testified that it was his specific instruction that Ramachandran was to see PW1 after that, to get him to sign the transfer form before going to ROV to formally effect the transfer. As to why he did not carry out these things himself, the appellant explained that his partnership had just been dissolved and he was quite busy. He claimed Ramachandran was the only person he could rely on. While he could not remember exactly when he hired Ramachandran, he knew that the latter was a Malaysian. It was his evidence that Ramachandran was originally hired as an apprentice mechanic but as he could not perform his work properly, he was subsequently employed as a driver.
 29.Ramachandran did not return that day, and it was only when PW1 called a week later that the appellant claimed he realised what had happened. He confessed to PW1 that he had handed part of the money PW1 paid to his driver but his driver had disappeared and not reported for work. Ramachandran finally showed up two weeks later and told the appellant that he had spent all the money which the latter had entrusted to him. At a loss, the appellant called PW1 and asked for time to settle the matter. Although PW1 had paid another $35,000 by cheque, the appellant had spent all of it on upgrading works on his workshop and services he had carried out on the car sold to PW1. Since it was his fault, the appellant promised to continue the remaining hire purchase payments to Yong Trading. In the meantime, PW1`s passports and other documents were returned to him.
 30.It was only after some time that PW1 finally called the appellant again. This time, however, it was to pester him for the log book. As the car was still under hire purchase and therefore still in the appellant`s name, the appellant stated in his evidence that he suggested that the only solution was to take out a remortgage on the same car. By doing so, the hire purchase payments would be settled using the loan from the car. The car would then be transferred to PW1`s name. In addition, the appellant promised to pay the monthly instalments for the loan on behalf of PW1. According to the appellant, PW1 agreed to this proposal. The appellant therefore took the initiative and asked PW7 to arrange for the car loan. He also arranged for PW1 to come to his workshop to meet PW7 to execute the loan. For reasons which were not explained before the court, PW1 never turned up. PW7 therefore left the loan documents with the appellant. The appellant stated he then called PW1 and told him that Ramachandran would bring the loan documents for him to sign. The appellant instructed Ramachandran to do the same. Ramachandran subsequently came back with the documents duly signed.
 31.PW7 came to collect the documents some time later. As he had promised to pay the monthly instalments for PW1, the appellant therefore also asked PW7 to address all the correspondence in respect of the loan to him.
 32.Some time later, PW1 telephoned the appellant again. He told the appellant the car had to be sent for inspection and the log book was needed. The appellant claimed he did repairs worth some $1,500 on the car for free and arranged for the inspection of the car. To reassure PW1, he also gave an undertaking to PW1.
 33.The appellant defaulted of the payment of the ESH loan and in February 1996, the car was towed away. PW1 therefore asked the appellant to accompany him to ESH, as it was PW1`s evidence that he had no idea what was going on. It was only then, as the appellant claimed, that he realised PW1 was denying that the signatures on the ESH loan documents were his. However, he neither protested nor said anything, since he was caught by surprise at the sudden turn of events. PW1 subsequently confirmed the signatures were genuine and the appellant gave a new undertaking that he would settle the ESH loan in full in six months. At the same time, PW1 agreed he would withdraw the police report he made earlier on the appellant. However, PW8 refused to allow PW1 to do so. When the appellant contacted PW8 later, he claimed PW8 was abusive to him.
 34.Finally, when the matter was being investigated, PW8 recorded a statement from the appellant. The appellant admitted that everything went smoothly.However, when the appellant then refused to sign the statement, he claimed PW8 threatened to send him to the lock-up. All these allegations were flatly denied by PW8.
 35.
 The trial judge`s decision 
 
The judge, after a careful and detailed consideration of the evidence, came to the conclusion that the appellant had indeed cheated PW1 in the sale and purchase of the car and had further forged PW1`s signatures on the ESH loan documents to obtain a loan for his benefit at the expense of PW1. In particular, she found PW1 and PW2 truthful witnesses whereas the evidence of the appellant was littered with inconsistencies and lies. She therefore convicted the appellant on both charges.
 36.On the offence of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code, the judge held that the appellant had induced PW1 to deliver a sum of $60,568 to him. She held that defence counsel`s argument that there was no inducement because the appellant only told PW1 the transfer of the car would be made after he had paid for it was too narrow a view to take. It was her view that the totality of the evidence pointed to the conclusion that the PW1 had paid the appellant in the belief that he would get ownership of the car. The fact that the appellant only told PW1 that he would transfer the car after it was sold to PW1 was inconsequential. As to the dishonesty element of the charge, the judge was also satisfied that the appellant had the intention to do so. The conduct of the appellant and the circumstances of the case suggested the appellant had planned to cheat and in fact cheated PW1. As the judge summarised (at [para ] 74):
The whole conduct of the [appellant] was shrouded in dishonesty, and the irresistible inference was that the [appellant] did not have any intention of promptly transferring the car to PW1 upon receipt of the purchase moneys. The [appellant] had schemed from the start to take advantage of PW 1`s trust and ignorance of the local system of transfers of cars to obtain for himself the benefit of the full use if the purchase monies without having to effect an immediate discharge [of] his own hire purchase indebtedness.
 37.As to the second offence of forgery under s 471 of the Penal Code, again the judge came to the conclusion that it was proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had committed the offence. She accepted PW1`s evidence that he had not signed the ESH loan documents. Further, there was expert evidence to support the prosecution`s claim that the signatures were not genuine but had been forged. She was also convinced the appellant knew that the loan documents were forged but nevertheless fraudulently used those same documents to take out a loan which benefited no one but himself. The elements of the second offence were thus made out.
 38.
 The appeal 
 
The appellant contended that the judge erred when she convicted him of the respective charges for which he was charged. In any event, even if the charges against the appellant were made out, they did not warrant the sentences given.
 39.For the sake of convenience and clarity, I shall consider each charge separately, since they both relate to separate incidents.
 40.
 The first charge 
 
The relevant parts of s 420 reads:
Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, ... shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to a fine.
 41.As to the definition of `cheat`, s 415 of the same Act states:
Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind reputation or property, is said to `cheat`.
 42.In my view, in order to find that an offence has been committed under s 420, read together with s 415, three elements of the offence must be satisfied. First, the victim must be deceived. To put it another way, deception must have been practised on the victim. This is to state the obvious, as this is the whole basis for a charge being brought against the deceiving party.
 43.Secondly, there must have been an inducement such that the victim delivered any property to any person. There is no requirement that this inducement must necessarily be oral, although in most cases that would usually be the case. There is also no need for this inducement to be express, as compared to it being inferred. As an example, the deceiving party need not specifically induce the victim to deliver some property (eg by saying or doing something specifically such that the victim was induced), if it could reasonably be inferred from the surrounding circumstances that this was clearly what the deceiving party was seeking to do (ie if the totality of the actions of the deceiving party pointed to him trying to induce the victim to deliver some property, even though any particular act of the deceiving party, when taken alone, may not amount to an inducement enough to induce the victim to deliver up some property). Further, this inducement must lead to the delivery of the property. If there was delivery of some property but no inducement by the deceiving party, then it can hardly be said that there was any form of cheating, even if the deceiving party had the intention to cheat. The whole purpose of s 420 lies in the protection of innocent parties against being cheated by unscrupulous persons. Thus, if the deceiving party failed to do anything which the innocent party relied on, such that he or she delivered some property, this would hardly be considered to be cheating. In addition, there is no requirement that the property delivered must belong to the victim (see 
 PP v Kalpanath Singh 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 564
) nor must the property be delivered to the person who deceived the victim. In my opinion, the wording of s 420 was not meant to be so narrow that there could only be cheating when the victim delivers property to the deceiving and dishonest party through his inducement. Similarly, in 
 Seaward v PP 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 369
, I held that the inducement need not be the sole or even main reason for the delivery of the property by the deceived party. So long as the deceiving party`s deception played some part in inducing the victim to deliver some property, this element in the offence would be satisfied. As to what constituted property, it is not in dispute that money for the purposes of cheating amounted to property.
 44.Finally, there must be a dishonest or fraudulent intention on the part of the deceiving person to induce the victim to deliver the property (ie to cheat) before the offence could be made out. This would constitute the mens rea for the offence, and relates substantially to the definition of `cheating` as in s 415.
 45.Counsel for the appellant, arguing on behalf of the appellant in relation to the first charge, ran his appeal on the following grounds. First, he contended that the prosecution`s evidence from PW1 failed to show that the appellant had displayed any fraudulent or dishonest intention when PW1 paid him $60,568 for the purchase of the car. Next, he contended that there was no inducement to PW1 such that PW1 was influenced to deliver his money to the appellant based on that inducement. If anything, the appellant was only guilty of a mere breach of the terms under the agreement between PW1 and the appellant as to the sale and purchase of the car. This breach related to the appellant failing to transfer the car to PW1`s name as agreed. Thus, it was contended that the appellant could not be guilty of the offence as charged, just because he had failed to carry out a term of this agreement between PW1 and himself.
 46.I deal with the second issue first, namely, that there was no inducement exercised by the appellant on PW1 which caused PW1 to deliver the money for the purchase of the car. In this respect, I found that the appellant`s contentions to be without merit. In my opinion, there is no doubt that the circumstances surrounding the sale and purchase of the car between the appellant and PW1, albeit not on any specific particular day, pointed to the appellant inducing PW1 to pay for the car, and at the same time or thereabouts, not intending to transfer the ownership of the car to PW1`s name. It is on this basis that PW1 was cheated. Counsel for the appellant argued that the offence against the appellant was not made out because the act of deception exercised on PW1, as stated in the charge, pointed to PW1 being led to believe that the ownership of the car would be transferred to him after he had paid for it on 30 June 1994. Therefore, there could not have been any deception practised on PW1 such that he was induced by the appellant to part with his money.
 47.In this respect, it is pertinent to note the reasoning of the judge in the trial below. She held that the appellant`s counsel`s view was to narrow. In my judgment, the judge was perfectly right in construing the charge and considering the evidence before her in this manner. As far as the act of deception was concerned, it related not to the appellant`s specific oral representations to PW1 on 30 June 1994 that he would transfer the car into the latter`s name after PW1 had paid for it but rather to PW1`s belief that he would own the car after he had paid for it. To construe the offence in any other way would be to restrict its scope to a narrow extent which I do not think was ever intended by Parliament. In fact, should the appellant`s contention be adopted, the ambit of the offence would reach the point of impracticability. I could not accept the notion that the inducement in the present instance must be the appellant`s oral representations to PW1 that he would transfer the car after PW1 paid for it, when it was clear that PW1 and the appellant conducted themselves in the whole transaction for the sale and purchase of the car with a view that PW1 would be the sole and rightful owner of the car after he had paid for it. A practical and realistic approach has to be taken here. To put it another way, the appellant`s deception had to be looked at in totality rather than as an isolated event of the appellant`s oral representations to PW1 that dayon 30 June 1994. This could be the only sensible approach and when that was done, the only irresistible conclusion which could be drawn was that the appellant was guilty of inducing PW1 to part with his money with the intention of cheating him. As the judge helpfully observed, the appellant and PW1 had all along proceeded on the basis that PW1 would be the sole legal owner of the car after he bought it. This was evidenced not only by the fax he sent to PW1 regarding the details of the car together with the payment particulars but also by PW1`s evidence that the transfer of the car would be made soon after payment. PW1 also gave evidence that he expected to become the owner of the car upon payment of the cash price, an event which unfortunately did not materialise until almost a year later. It mattered not whether the appellant represented to PW1 when he would transfer the car into PW1`s name. A little common sense would show that this was obvious once PW1 paid for the car. The crucial fact was that PW1 was led to believe, and he conducted himself in a like manner, that he would be the owner of the car once he paid for it. It was therefore only right that the whole transaction between the appellant and PW1 be taken into account to ascertain the inducement which made PW 1 deliver a sum of $60,568 to the appellant. As to the oral representations that the car would be transferred into PW1`s name on 30 June 1994, I agreed with the judge`s conclusion that this was nothing more than a simple assurance to PW1 that he would be registered as the legal owner of the car. Likewise for the request by the appellant for PW1`s passport and other documents to effect the transfer. All the subsequent events after the payment by PW1 for the car confirmed that there was an understanding on the part of PW1, led by the appellant`s actions, that the car was to be transferred into PW1`s name when he paid for it. When the appellant failed to do so immediately after payment without any reasonable excuse, the offence crystallised. This was on 30 June 1994. Thus the act of payment constituted the offence. The prosecution was therefore correct when it charged that the appellant cheated PW1 on 30 June 1994 (ie the appellant was charged that he `on or about the 30th day of June 1994 _ did cheat`). There was no scope for the argument that the failure of the appellant to effect the transfer only amounted to a mere breach of the terms of the agreement between PW1 and the appellant. The prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that PW1 bought the car under the impression given to him by the appellant that he would be the sole owner of the car after he paid for it.
 48.I then came to counsel`s second objection in relation to the s 420 offence committed by the appellant. Counsel argued that there was nothing in the complaint or the evidence of PW1 which showed that the appellant displayed any dishonest or fraudulent intention to deceive PW1. He argued that such dishonesty or fraud, if present, should be assessed before or at the time PW1 parted with his money. In the present case, when PW1 paid the appellant, there was nothing to suggest that the appellant had intended not to transfer the car into PW1`s name, thus he was not guilty of either dishonest or fraudulent intention on his part.
 49.I found this contention completely untenable. In my judgment, the actions of the appellant before PW1 handed over the money for the car had to be construed in conjunction with the actions of the appellant after the car had been sold. In other words, while the appellant`s dishonest or fraudulent intentions had to be considered before PW1 was induced to part with his property, such intentions could also be inferred with the aid of subsequent events which occurred after PW1had parted with his money. Although the acts and intentions of the appellant before PW1 had paid for the car were unhelpful, in that they could not be used specifically to show that the appellant was dishonest or fraudulent, an analysis of the appellant`s subsequent actions could and should be considered to shed light on the appellant`s intentions in this respect. In fact, these subsequent actions confirmed the appellant`s dishonesty. For example, using the present case as a scenario, if the appellant pretended to act honestly before he sold the car to PW1, but after it was sold refused to transfer the car into PW1`s name, then, on the basis that only the appellant`s actions and intentions before the car was sold could be taken into account, the appellant could never be guilty of cheating under s 420, since he had acted as if he was honest at all times before the sale of the car. On the other hand, if his actions could be considered post-sale of the car, then it could be inferred that he had the dishonest or fraudulent intention to deceive PW1, but that he acted honestly before that so as to get PW1 to buy the car.
 50.In the circumstances, the judge was perfectly entitled to come to her conclusion that the facts of the case, taken as a whole before and after the sale of the car to PW1, pointed to the appellant having a dishonest intention to deceive PW1. The judge made mention of her reasoning in this respect, which I found particularly helpful and I respectfully repeat it. First, she noted that the appellant lied when PW1 asked about the `red book` for the car. There was no dispute that this `red book` was the car`s log book, an essential document for older cars which recorded the ownership of these cars. Then, there was the failure by the appellant to disclose that the car was still under hire purchase and the transfer of the car could not be effected until such outstanding payments under the hire purchase scheme for the car had been fully paid. In fact, the appellant hid this fact from PW1 as long as he could, and it was only a year later, after much pestering by PW1 about the log book for the car, that the appellant confessed about the hire purchase taken out on the car. The appellant`s assurances that he could effect the transfer of the car immediately therefore turned out to be untrue. Further, and even more significantly, the appellant took no steps, after PW1 had bought the car, to discharge his hire purchase obligations to Yong Trading. The transfer was finally effected in June 1995, a year after PW1 had bought the car, and this was done through another loan taken out using forged signatures of PW1.
 51.In view of what I have set out above, I therefore found no merit in the appellant`s appeal. I accepted fully the judge`s assessment of the appellant and his evidence, which was that he should not be believed in what he said. Here was a foreign national which the appellant took advantage of through the former`s lack of knowledge of the systems of car buying and selling in Singapore. The appellant abused his position when PW1 trusted him. Such behaviour should not be tolerated. Accordingly, I dismissed the appellant`s appeal in relation to the first charge.
 52.
 The second charge 
 
I then came to the second charge under s 471 of the Penal Code which reads:
Whoever fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine any document which he knows or has reason to believe to be a forged document, shall be punished in the same manner asif he had forged such document.
 53.This section speaks for itself. For the appellant to be found guilty of the offence of forgery under s 471, four elements must be satisfied. They are: . that the documents in question were forged; that the appellant used such a document; that the appellant used it as a genuine one; and that the appellant knew or had reason to believe that the document was a forged one.
 54.Should any one of the above elements not be satisfied, then the offence of forgery as stated under s 471 would not be made out. The learned judge in the district court found that the appellant`s actions had satisfied these four limbs. The appellant contended that the judge was wrong. I propose to consider these four limbs separately, for the determination of this issue in the appellant`s appeal.
 55.
 a The documents in question were forged 
 
Counsel for the appellant disputed the fact that the documents in question, the ESH loan documents, were forged. While he felt inclined to accept the opinions of PW3, the expert witness who testified that the signatures on the loan documents were not those of PW1`s, nevertheless he argued that a reasonable doubt existed due to the fact that PW1 had signed an undertaking in the presence of PW2 that the signatures in the loan documents were his. He also argued that this undertaking was not produced before PW3 for verification. Hence, PW3`s testimony should not be totally accepted.
 56.With respect, I did not agree. During the trial below, both PW1 and PW3 gave evidence that the loan documents were forged. Further, PW1`s evidence was consistent with the fact that he did not know that a loan had been taken out with ESH using his car. I was unable, just as the judge in the court below failed to do, to find a single hint that PW1`s testimony in this respect should not be believed. PW1 contacted ESH as soon as he knew that his car was being repossessed. He asked for a copy of the loan documents, and this evidence was confirmed by PW2. When he received the documents, he promptly denied signing them. Further, the appellant somewhat contradicted himself when he told PW2 and her boss that the loan documents were forged by his partner. If the appellant had no knowledge that the documents were forged, I would have thought he would have insisted so, instead of pushing the blame to his partner. In any event, the judge noted that both PW2 and PW3 were independent witnesses who had nothing to gain from giving their evidence. In my view, this added weight to their testimony. I am therefore convinced that the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the documents were forged. There was not only direct evidence given by PW1 and PW3 that this was so, but this was supported by circumstantial evidence as well. For example, the execution of the loan documents was concluded in circumstances which gave rise to some degree of suspicion. PW7 gave evidence that he had never met PW1, and PW2 also confirmed that the first time she saw PW1 was when he came to their premises in March 1996. The appellant`s defence was that his worker, Ramachandran, played him out and fooled him in the process. But there was no evidence as to the existence of this worker whom the appellantwas alleged to have employed. Further, as the learned judge observed, the appellant was continually contradicting himself. He made numerous mistakes as to the name of this worker, and often referred to him as a partner, when the prosecution had already established beyond any dispute that there were no other partners other than PW5 and PW6. All this evidence went to show that the appellant was indeed trying to hide something, and this cast doubt over his insistence that he never knew that the loan documents were forged until PW1 found out about it in February 1996. The appellant claimed PW1 approved of the loan, but not once had he confirmed with PW1 that this was actually the case after the documents had been signed.
 57.As for appellant counsel`s emphasis on the undertaking PW1 signed to verify the authenticity of his signatures on the loan documents, PW1 himself had already provided a perfectly logical and acceptable explanation for it. As PW2 stated, ESH insisted that PW1 sign an undertaking that the signatures contained in the loan documents were his before his car could be released. It could be seen from his evidence that PW1 was frustrated and exasperated. He tried hard to explain that he had not signed the loan documents in question and had already paid for the car. It was obvious that he could not understand why buying a car in Singapore was so much trouble. In his desperation to get back his car, he therefore signed the undertaking, not realising in his naivet_ that it could be used against him at trial. After all, he was a foreign national who trusted the appellant. The judge was therefore right in disregarding the undertaking signed by him and I approve of her findings in its entirety.
 58.
 b The appellant used such a document 
 
Unfortunately, and somewhat surprisingly, there was no direct evidence which could show that the appellant used the loan documents. However, in my judgment, the circumstances of the present case more than allowed for such an inference to be drawn. In this respect, it is essential to look at the facts which led to the execution and approval of the loan. The appellant told PW7 that a customer of his wanted to take out a loan. PW7 thus arranged to meet with PW1. Somehow, this meeting was never successful. The appellant then took it upon himself, allegedly with Ramachandran`s assistance, to procure PW1`s signature. He did so and when he returned the documents to PW7 for the latter to take out the loan, he asked PW7 to direct all correspondence to him. When the loan was granted, it was used to pay off his outstanding hire purchase balances. The appellant even paid for the monthly instalments for the loan. He thus benefited from the approval of the loan. It was not in dispute that at no time did PW1 come into the picture. I thus had my doubts that PW1 had approved and executed the loan documents when he gained absolutely nothing from it. In particular, I found it extremely hard to believe that PW1 would be so generous. He had already paid for the car and there was no indication that he needed the loan from ESH for any purpose. If anything, it was the appellant who needed the money from the loan. The loan benefited the appellant wholly. In my view therefore, a clear inference could be drawn from the facts of the case that the appellant had used the documents for his own benefit.
 59.
 c The appellant used the documents as a genuine one 
 
Having concluded that the appellant used the loan documents to benefit himself, the only question to answer in this respect is whether the appellant knew, at the time he used those documents, that they were a fraud, but that he nevertheless used them as genuine documents.
 60.I was of the view that this question could be answered in the positive. If one takes a close look at the conduct of the appellant from the sale of the car in 1994 to the car being repossessed by ESH in February 1996, there is no doubt that the appellant forged the loan documents but used them as genuine documents to obtain a loan for his own benefit. While he maintained at all times that he did not realise that the loan documents were forged, he could not explain why PW1 had claimed and protested that he did not sign the loan documents. The judge came to the conclusion, on a close evaluation of the appellant`s evidence, that the appellant`s testimony was fraught with inconsistencies and should not be believed. I found her detailed evaluation of the appellant`s demeanour particularly enlightening. She gave a precise and yet concise account of why she thought the appellant`s should not be believed, some of which I have already adopted in my reasoning in the preceding paragraphs. I thus treated the appellant`s explanations that he did not know the loan documents were forged with suspicion. After all, the appellant obtained the loan documents from PW7 for PW1 to sign. It was not disputed that the appellant, with the occasional entrance of PW7 and PW2, handled the execution of the loan from start to finish. PW1 denied signing the documents, after which the appellant conveniently pushed the blame to his worker. However, when he was asked to provide details about this worker, he could not do so. He even claimed he lost this worker`s address because it was stored in a computer which was somewhat unfortunately erased when his workshop was hit by lightning. Assuming the appellant`s explanation to be true, I found it hard to imagine that anyone could be as unlucky as he was, for he was not only played out by PW1 when PW1 denied signing the documents but also by his worker Ramachandran, who absconded with his money and forged loan documents, albeit for his own benefit. These coincidences were too close for comfort. In my judgment, the appellant had forged the documents and used them.
 60.Before I leave this issue, there is just one point which I need to address. When ESH approved the loan documents in 1995, PW1`s passport and his other documents were produced. Counsel for the appellant argued that, by virtue of this, PW1 had agreed to execute the loan. When questioned, PW1 could not shed any light on this question.
 62.I think that the failure of PW1 to provide a satisfactory answer still does not detract from the fact that the appellant may have forged the documents to use them subsequently. The production of PW1`s passport and other relevant documents simply served to convince ESH that the loan was, in actual fact, taken out by PW1, even though this was not the case. I was reminded of the fact that on some occasions in 1995, the appellant had serviced and repaired PW1`s car. In view of this, it was completely plausible that the appellant might have asked PW1 for his passport and other documents for these purposes, although strictly speaking they were not needed at all. After all, PW1 had faith in the appellant and trusted him.It was therefore conceivable that the appellant could have lied to him and obtained his passport and documents for the purposes of effecting the loan.
 63.
 d The appellant knew or had reason to believe that the document was a forged one 
 
For the reasons I have already stated above, I can dispose of this point relatively easily. In my opinion it was a foregone conclusion that the appellant knew that the loan documents were forged. He alone orchestrated the execution of the loan documents from start to finish. In my view, this was circumstantial evidence pointing to the appellant having knowledge that the signatures of PW1 were forged.
 64.Counsel for the appellant argued that neither PW2 nor PW7 suspected that the signatures were forged. Further, they too were involved in the execution of the loan documents. Therefore it was incorrect to say that the appellant handled the whole transaction for the loan, nor was it right that the appellant ought to have known that the documents were forged.
 65.I found these contentions unmeritorious. While it was true that neither PW2 nor PW7 suspected that the signatures were forged, both trusted the appellant to ensure that the appellant had acted with all honesty. To put it another way, PW7, being a friend of the appellant, naturally trusted him, having worked with him before. There was thus no reason to suspect that the signatures as contained in the loan documents were forged. Similarly, PW2 trusted PW7 to bring back genuine documents for verification and execution. While she admitted that she compared the signatures in the loan documents with PW1`s passport and found nothing amiss, I cautioned against placing too much weight on this fact. It is a procedural requirement that every loan document be verified with original signatures, but it is hardly right to expect PW2, an officer of ESH, to possess such skill and expertise as PW3 possessed to distinguish between genuine and forged signatures. In any event, there was never anything which ought to have alerted her that the loan documents may have been forged. She trusted PW7, a freelance broker, to bring in for her verification genuine and authentic loan documents. On the other hand, there was every reason to expect the appellant to ensure that the signatures he obtained from PW1, as he claimed, were genuine and correct. He entrusted the job of obtaining PW1`s signature on the loan documents to Ramachandran, someone who had cheated him of a hefty sum of $25,000 just less than a year earlier. Not only was Ramachandran not punished but the appellant continued to let him work in his workshop and even instructed him to carry out tasks of vital importance. There was thus every reason to suspect Ramachandran might cheat him again and the appellant`s failure to check on him did not bode well for his defence that he had been cheated again. It was completely unbelievable that after Ramachandran had cheated the appellant, the appellant still continued to let him run errands for him because his main concern was to effect the transfer of ownership of the car to PW1 and to let Ramachandran have a chance to redeem himself. As the judge observed, and with which I agreed fully, the fact that the appellant instructed PW7 to direct all correspondence to him only served to increase one`s suspicion of his actions in respect of the loan transaction. The appellant`s version of the events was then made more sceptical by the fact that only the appellant stood to benefit from the loan by ESH. It was undisputed thatthe appellant`s liability on his hire purchase outstandings would be discharged. Again, I asked myself the same question. Why would PW1, someone who had paid the market price for the car, take out a loan in favour of the appellant to discharge the appellant`s pre-existing debt and at the same time incurring more liability to himself? It went completely against logic, and thus, in my view, the only real explanation was that the appellant forged the loan documents, and so cheated PW1, in order to avoid any liability on his part to pay for the remaining hire purchase outstandings for the car he sold to PW1.
 66.On the above basis, I had no doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence of forgery under s 420 of the Penal Code. Accordingly, I also had no hesitation in dismissing his appeal on this charge.
 67.
 The sentence 
 
That just left me with a final issue to consider, and that was the appellant`s appeal against the sentences which the judge imposed upon his conviction for the respective offences. Section 420 imposes a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment and s 471, read with s 465, imposes a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment. The judge in the court below passed a sentence of six months each for each sentence, to run concurrently. In my view, and having regard to the severity of the offence and the maximum sentence allowed for each offence, I came to the conclusion that while the sentence passed on the forgery charge was justifiable, the sentence passed on the cheating charge was not proportionate to the crime committed, having regard to the nature of the offence and the severity of the sentence as allowed to be imposed under the Penal Code. I took account of the fact that PW1, the victim in this case, was a foreign national who was unfamiliar with certain systems of work in Singapore. He was exploited and cheated by the appellant, who not only added more inconvenience to PW1 subsequently, but that this also gave Singapore a bad name. In any event, the appellant had numerous opportunities to redeem himself after the cheating incident, but never once did he take the chance. In fact, PW1 was even kind enough on many occasions to grant him extended time periods to redeem himself. The appellant remained unrepentant all this while.
 68.I therefore took the liberty, having regard to the circumstances of the case, to enhance the appellant`s sentence on the cheating offence under s 420 of the Penal Code to one of 12 months, to run concurrently with the appellant`s other sentence of six months. I think this sentence best reflects the crime which he committed. On this basis, the appellant`s imprisonment is extended to 12 months in total.

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
KARTHIGESU JA
 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The appellant was initially tried in the court below on the following two charges: 
(a) 1st Charge 
That you, Yong Yow Chee, 
on or about 21 December 1996 at about 5.30pm at an apartment known as 545-C, East Coast Road, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) to wit, by having in your possession seven packets and 45 sachets of substance containing not less than 244.35g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking at the said apartment without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. 
(b) 2nd Charge 
on or about 21 December 1996 at about 4.55pm near the junction of Jalan Besar and Sam Leong Road, Singapore did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) to wit, by having in your possession five sachets of substance containing not less than 2.58g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking near the said junction without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 2.Four other charges preferred against him for possession of (a) 1.23g of diamorphine, (b) 2 tablets containing nimetozepan, a Class C drug, (c) 13 tablets also containing nimetozepan, and (d) 3 `Wellcome L4A` tablets containing methadone, a Class A drug were stood down by the prosecution pending the outcome of the trial.
 3.At the close of the prosecution`s case the trial judge after hearing arguments from the deputy public prosecutor and defence counsel expressing the view that there would not be any prejudice to the appellant if the two charges were amalgamated as one, ruled that the charges should be amended and amalgamated as follows: 
You, Yong Yow Chee, m/38 yrs
 
NRIC S 1362689-H
 
are charged that you, on or about 21 December 1996, at about between 4.55pm and 5.30pm did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) by having in your possession, to wit, on your person as well as at 545-C Ocean Apartments East Coast Road, Singapore, seven packets and 50 sachets of a substance amounting to not less than 246.93g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking, without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
 At the end of the trial, the trial judge found the appellant guilty. As to the other charges which were stood down earlier, the appellant was given a discharge amounting to an acquittal pursuant to s 177 of the CPC. We heard his appeal on 24 September 1997 which we dismissed without calling on the deputy public prosecutor. We now give our reasons.
 4.
 Prosecution evidence
The following is the evidence adduced by prosecution at the trial.
 5.On 21 December 1996 at about 12.45pm, Corporals Tan Choon Kiang Ivan, Lim Eng Poh, Lim Yee Chong, Chan Siang Hock and Woman Narcotics Officer Tan Wee Cheng Delphine, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), were deployed in the vicinity of Ocean Apartments at 545-C East Coast Road to look out for a male Chinese nicknamed `Tua Pui Gan` who was suspected to be living at the said address.
 6.Tua Pui Gan, who was later identified as the appellant, was seen emerging from Ocean Apartments at about 3.50pm. He boarded a taxi and this taxi was trailed by the CNB officers to the junction of Jalan Besar and Syed Alwi Road. The appellant was seen alighting from the taxi and meeting with an unknown male Chinese who walked with the appellant for a short distance before they parted company. The appellant then entered a coffee shop at the junction of Sam Leong Road and Jalan Besar where he had a drink and was subsequently joined by a male Chinese. At 4.30pm, the CNB officers on duty moved in and arrested both the appellant and the other person, at the coffee shop. Subsequently at about 4.55pm, ASP Chew Kai Chow (ASP Chew) who was then accompanied by Sergeant Goh Seow Thian (Sgt Goh) and Corporal Iqbal bin Mohamed (Cpl Iqbal) arrived at the scene and took charge of the appellant from the officers who had him in their custody. The appellant was escorted into a waiting CNB vehicle by Cpl Iqbal.
 7.In the vehicle, ASP Chew asked the appellant in Hokkien whether he had any drugs in his possession. The appellant replied that he had five sachets of heroin on him. ASP Chew then asked him where he kept his house keys. He replied that it was in his left front trouser pocket. Cpl Iqbal retrieved the keys and ASP Chew removed a newspaper bundle from that same pocket. The newspaper bundle was found to contain five sachets of granular substance.
 8.At about 5.15pm, the appellant was taken to 545-C East Coast Road, Ocean Apartments by ASP Chew and his party of CNB officers. One of the officers, Inspector Adam Fashe Huddin opened the metal grille at the front entrance of the flat, using one of the keys from the bunch of keys seized earlier. The officers found that the apartment consisted of three rooms, a hall, a kitchen and a toilet at the kitchen. All three room doors were locked. Using one of the keys from the bunch seized earlier, ASP Chew opened the door to the master bedroom of the flat.
 9.There was a black suitcase on the floor beside the bed in the room. ASP Chew lifted the suitcase and found a piece of carpet partially covering a piece of wooden board on the floor. Upon lifting the carpet, he found numerous unsealed sachets of granular substance. On counting them he discovered that there were 42 sachets altogether. ASP Chew then checked the suitcase and found that it was padlocked at the zippers. Sgt Goh used a paper cutter to make an opening at the top middle part of the suitcase just above the handle of the suitcase and pulled out a black `Camus Cognac` bag and a white plastic bag. ASP Chew examined the white plastic bag whereupon he found five packets of granular substance. The black `Camus Cognac` bag was empty.
 10.Thereafter Sgt Goh searched the wardrobe in the bedroom and found an OCBC bank book belonging to the appellant and a small key. Sometime later, ASP Chew found another small key in the same drawer, underneath some clothing. Whilst searching the flat, Cpl Iqbal found a single sachet of granular substance lying behind a wooden chest in the hall. Eventually, the other two bedroom doors were forced open by the officers but they were found to be uninhabited and had nothing in it of significance.
 11.At about 6.15pm, the investigating officer, Senior Staff-Sergeant (SS/Sgt Wong) arrived at the flat. According to both ASP Chew and SS/Sgt Wong, the small keys found in the wardrobe drawer could unlock the padlock on the black suitcase. When SS/Sgt Wong opened the suitcase, he found and removed an opened plastic packet of yellow granular substance, a sealed packet of yellow granular substance, two sachets of yellow granular substance tied with a rubber band, a metal bowl, a digital weighing scale and a white plastic spoon. At about 7.40pm, the appellant informed ASP Chew in Hokkien that he had a small sachet of heroin in his wallet. This was added to the other exhibits which were all handed over to SS/Sgt Wong. At about 9.40pm, SS/Sgt Wong left the flat with all the seized items.
 12.SS/Sgt Wong then brought all the items to the CNB Headquarters, where at about 10pm he weighed the drug exhibits in the presence of the appellant. Thereafter, he made arrangements for the appellant to be sent to Changi Hospital for a pre-statement medical examination. As a result, the appellant was warded at the Changi Prison Hospital on account of drug withdrawal symptoms. SS/Sgt Wong then handed over all the drug exhibits to the Department of Scientific Services (DSS) at about 10am on 23 December 1996.
 13.On 27 December 1996, SS/Sgt Wong was informed that the appellant was fit to be discharged from hospital. The appellant was then sent to Alexandra Hospital for a pre-statement medical examination. After the examination, SS/Sgt Wong with the assistance of Mr Wu Nan Yong , a senior interpreter attached to CNB, interpreting in Hokkien, proceeded to record statements from him pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) at about 3.41pm.
 14.The appellant was served with two charges of trafficking - one in respect of the six sachets of granular substance seized from him and the other in respect of the 45 sachets and seven packets of granular substance recovered from the flat. The appellant gave a signed statement as regards the six sachets and a verbal one as regards the 45 sachets and seven packets. The defence at the trial had no objections to admitting both the statements; they had been given voluntarily without any threat, inducement or promise emanating from the recording officer or the interpreter or anyone else during or before the recording of the statement. Therefore, both statements were admitted in evidence.
 15.The first statement which was signed by the appellant, recorded between 3.20pm and 3.28pm on 27 December 1996, reads as follows: 
I admit that the five (5) sachets of heroin in the newspaper belong to me. The remaining one sachet was surrendered by me to the CNB officer.
 The second statement recorded between 3.56pm and 4pm also on 27 December 1996, although not signed by the appellant reads: 
The heroin in the apartment do (sic) not belong to me.
 SS/Sgt Wong and the interpreter, Mr Wu said that the appellant declined to append his signature to the latter statement.
 16.There were two further statements recorded from the appellant - one between 10am and 12.50am on 28 December 1996 and the other between 9.50am and 10.50am on 31 December 1996. These two long statements were also admitted in evidence as being made voluntarily without any objection from the defence at the trial, after confirmation from defence counsel that they were voluntary in nature.
 17.The main features of the long statements may be summarised as follows (i). On 21 December 1996 when the appellant was arrested at the junction of Jalan Besar and Sam Leong Road, he was residing at 2001 Syed Alwi Road. Shortly before his arrest he had talked on the telephone with one Ah Seng. He told Ah Seng that he wanted heroin. Ah Seng told him to go to 545C East Coast Road and help himself as Ah Seng did not wish to go to the East Coast Road flat. Ah Seng thought that he and the East Coast Road flat were under surveillance. Ah Seng told him that the keys to the flat were in the flower stand near the main door of the flat.
 (ii). The appellant went to the East Coast Road flat and let himself in, using a key from the bunch of keys from the flower stand near the main door. He explained that three of the bunch of seven keys were the keys to his room at Syed Alwi Road.
 (iii). When he entered the flat there was no one there. He entered the master bedroom by unlocking the door with one of the keys from the bunch. In the master bedroom he saw a packet of heroin in a metal basin on the floor. He opened the packet and started to repack the heroin into the empty sachets he found on the floor. In fact he repacked the whole packet but did not know into how many sachets. He used a metal spoon from the bedroom to scoop the heroin from the packet into the sachets. He did not weigh the quantity of heroin he put in the sachets nor did he seal them.
 (iv). However, he weighed the ten sachets of heroin he was going to take away with him. He used an electronic scale which he found in the room to weigh the ten sachets of heroin to ensure that each sachet contained about 7.8g. He sealed the sachets by heating the open ends with a cigarette lighter and holding them together with a pair of tweezers. When this was done he wrapped five sachets together in one newspaper wrapping and the other five sachets in another newspaper wrapping and put one in his left and the other in his right trouser`s pocket.
 (v). Before he left the flat he placed the packed but unsealed sachets of heroin under a white board he found in the bedroom. He also saw a black suitcase in the bedroom. He noticed it was locked and did not touch it. He locked the bedroom and left the flat but could not remember whether he locked the main door or the metal gate but was sure he had locked one of them. He kept the keys with him as Ah Seng had told him that he would collect the keys from him in Syed Alwi Road later at 5pm.
 (vi). He then took a taxi to Syed Alwi Road where he met one Ah Meng whom he had arranged to meet there at about 3pm and sold him five sachets of heroin for $350. This was one of the newspaper wrapped bundles he had in one of his trouser pockets. The transaction completed he went to a coffee shop at the junction of Jalan Besar and Sam Leong Road where he was arrested by CNB officers. They found on him in one of his trouser pockets the other newspaper wrapped bundle of five sachets of heroin and the $350. The appellant maintained that the five packets of heroin were for his own consumption. In fact later the appellant voluntarily handed to the CNB officers a single sachet of heroin partially consumed which he had in his purse. He also told the CNB officers that he would be paying Ah Seng $700 for the ten sachets of heroin when Ah Seng came to Syed Alwi Road at 5pm to collect the keys to the East Coast Road flat.
 (vii). The appellant said he had met Ah Seng about ten years ago at a Drug Rehabilitation Centre and had got to know him rather well. He believed Ah Seng lived somewhere in North Bridge Road. Sometime in December 1996 Ah Seng told him that he was a `wanted person` and had to find somewhere else to live. He asked the appellant to look out for a place to rent. Through a housing agent the appellant had found the East Coast Road flat and had rented the master bedroom in his own name at $800 per month. A deposit of $800 was also payable. Ah Seng had given him $2,000 for the rent and deposit and as this came to only $1,600 he had kept the balance of $400 for himself.
 (viii). Both he and Ah Seng used the master bedroom in the East Coast Road flat. As for himself he did not spend every night there though he would go there from time to time to smoke heroin. He had some of his clothing there and so did Ah Seng.
 (ix). When the appellant was asked why he repacked the whole of the packet of heroin into sachets on the afternoon of 21 December 1996 in the master bedroom of the East Coast Road flat he said, `I did it because Ah Seng told me to assist him in repacking. I know that Ah Seng intended to sell these remaining repacked sachets of heroin after I took my 10 sachets`.
 18.On 30 December 1996, SS/Sgt Wong visited a boarding house at 2001A Syed Alwi Road. This was where the appellant was also said to have been residing at the material time. He had brought along the bunch of keys which had been seized from the appellant earlier. He found that one of the keys could open the lock on the wooden door at the entrance at the ground floor; another key could open the lock on the wooden door on the second level and yet another key could open the door of the middle room on the second level which the appellant claimed he occupied.
 19.Mr Lim Keng Yam, the operator of the boarding house at 2001A Syed Alwi Road, testified that the appellant enquired about renting a room on 30 September 1996. The appellant had agreed to rent the middle room on the second level and Mr Lim had given him three keys, a key to the front door at the ground level, another key to the wooden door on the second level and yet another to his room. The appellant had paid a total of $1,500 for the rental covering the period October to December 1996.
 20.According to Mr Lim, the last time he had seen the appellant at 2001A Syed Alwi Road was on 8 or 9 December 1996. He said that he had seen the appellant moving two red plastic bags. Sometime in late December 1996, a lady who identified herself as the appellant`s mother called at the boarding house to collect items belonging to the appellant but when the room was opened by him in the presence of the lady, it was found empty except for a mattress, a pillow and a piece of carpet. There were no clothing or personal items in the room.
 21.As for the other premises, namely the East Coast Road flat, Mr Koh Chai Boon, the owner of the flat testified that he had been introduced to the appellant by Miss Irene Loi Juat Lin, a housing agent on 12 December 1996. After viewing the flat, the appellant had entered into a tenancy agreement to rent the master bedroom of the flat at a monthly rental of $800 with effect from 13 December 1996 and had paid a month`s rental as well as a deposit sum of $800. According to Mr Koh, he then handed three keys to the appellant. One key was to the padlock on the metal grill, another was to the lock on the wooden door and the third key was to the master bedroom. According to Mr Koh, he had seen the appellant and another male Chinese bringing a large black suitcase to the flat on 13 December 1996. Miss Loi confirmed that she had introduced the appellant to Mr Koh, after he had paged her looking to rent the flat.
 22.Overall, the prosecution`s case was that relying on the undisputed evidence that a large amount of heroin was seized from the flat; the current tenancy of which was in the name of the appellant; the recovery of the keys to the flat from the appellant; the recovery of five sachets on the person of the appellant and the admission by the appellant that he had handled and packed quite a number of sachets on the day of his arrest, the statutory presumption operated against the appellant and a prima facie case of being in possession of the heroin for the purpose of trafficking was made out. It was at this stage that the prosecution applied to amalgamate the two charges into one. As we have noted earlier, this application was not resisted and was allowed. Accordingly the appellant`s defence on the amalgamated charge was called. A submission of `no case to answer` was not made.
 23.
 Defence evidence
The appellant is a drug addict. Between the period of 1981 and 1987, he had been detained at the Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre on three different occasions. At the time of his arrest, the appellant had been involved in some bookmaking as well as moneylending activities. According to the appellant, he became acquainted with Ah Seng in 1985 at the drug centre. In his evidence, he confirmed that what he had said in his statement about Ah Seng being a heroin addict and selling heroin was true. He also said that they became close but that he did not have Ah Seng`s contact number and did not know where to contact him.
 24.The appellant`s evidence-in-chief was led mainly by his counsel in reference to the long statement he had given to SS/Sgt Wong and was mainly consistent with it which he confirmed in the material particulars. However he objected to the accuracy of the statement that he took a taxi to Syed Alwi Road and sold five sachets of heroin to one Ah Meng for $350 and that this was a prior arrangement. The appellant said that he gave the five sachets to Ah Meng instead of selling them to him. He did not dispute however that he received $350 from Ah Meng. He said, however, that the money was for Ah Seng.
 25.The appellant agreed that between September to December 1996, he was renting a room at 2001 Syed Alwi Road. He confirmed that in December Ah Seng had approached him to help him rent a room because he was a wanted person by the police and did not possess an identity card to rent the room. The appellant said that he agreed because they were on friendly terms and he felt indebted to Ah Seng as Ah Seng had sold him heroin at the rate of $70 per sachet.
 26.The advertisement for the room to rent at 545C, East Coast Road was in the Chinese newspaper. He viewed the apartment on 12 December 1996 and agreed to rent the master bedroom for $800. He paid the landlord a total of $1,600 being a month`s rental and a month`s deposit and he also paid the housing agent a commission of $400. He maintained that although he signed the tenancy agreement, the actual tenant was Ah Seng. He said that after he collected the keys for the flat, he handed them to Ah Seng at his room in Syed Alwi Road and Ah Seng reimbursed him the $2,000.
 27.According to the appellant, on the night of 13 December 1996, which was the day the appellant signed the tenancy agreement, Ah Seng moved in with a black suitcase which contained his clothing, perfumes, hair-dryer, radio and compact disc player. The appellant was shown some photographs of some clothing found in the wardrobe at the flat. The appellant maintained that all the clothing belonged to Ah Seng except for a jacket on the right side of the wardrobe. He said that he had slept overnight at the flat on two or three occasions.
 28.The appellant confirmed what he had said in his statement, namely that his last personal meeting with Ah Seng was on Saturday, 21 December 1996, the day of his arrest. He had last been to the flat on the morning of the same day. He had intended to go to the flat to collect ten sachets of heroin from Ah Seng. However, upon his arrival at the flat, Ah Seng informed him that he had no stock. Both of them then went to a nearby coffee shop and had a meal.
 29.At about 3pm, Ah Seng telephoned the appellant and told him that the supply of the heroin he wanted had arrived and it was at the flat. The appellant said that Ah Seng however said that he was afraid to go there as there were some Government men at the foot of his block. The appellant said that he did not know where Ah Seng was at that time but he could have been at Syed Alwi Road. Ah Seng told the appellant that the keys to the flat were left in one of the flower pots at the flat. He also told the appellant that there was some heroin on a plate in the master bedroom and he requested the appellant to help him pack the heroin.
 30.When the appellant went to the flat, he did as Ah Seng had requested and packed the heroin which he found on the plate but he did not seal them. He took his share of ten sachets and then he placed the locked black suitcase over the packed sachets. After doing all this, he left the flat. The appellant claimed that he only saw the packet of heroin in the metal basin and that he did not know of the existence of the heroin in the black suitcase or elsewhere. He claimed that in any event besides the ten sachets of heroin he was entitled to, all the heroin belonged to Ah Seng.
 31.The appellant went to Jalan Besar and met up with Ah Meng and gave him five sachets of heroin for $350. As seen above, the appellant maintained that it was not a sale but instead he had just given it to Ah Meng. The $350 Ah Meng gave him was for Ah Seng. He then intended to go to Syed Alwi Road to consume heroin and give the money to Ah Seng, along with the keys to the flat. The remaining five sachets of heroin which were later seized by the CNB officers were for his own consumption.
 32.Throughout, the appellant reiterated the position he had taken in his statements, namely, that the heroin found in the flat did not belong to him and that the sachets found on his person were for his own consumption. He also confirmed that he had no knowledge of the heroin in the black suitcase.
 33.In cross-examination, when asked why the appellant had thought that Ah Seng was at Syed Alwi Road when he had said that there were Government men at the foot of his block, the appellant said that Ah Seng also stayed at Syed Alwi Road and was therefore the appellant`s house-mate. When asked why if Ah Seng already had premises at Syed Alwi Road, he would ask the appellant to find a flat for him, the appellant said that this was because the owner of the house at Syed Alwi Road frequently opened the doors of their rooms in their absence. This was despite the fact that he had said in his statement, that he did not know Ah Seng`s contact number nor did he know where to contact him and that he believed that Ah Seng was staying somewhere in North Bridge Road.
 34.When queried as to how his bank book came to be in the top drawer of the wardrobe in the master bedroom of the flat, the appellant explained that he might have kept the bank book in the pocket of his jacket when he sent the jacket to Ah Seng for Ah Seng`s girlfriend to wash. She might have taken it out and left it in the drawer of the wardrobe.
 35.From the evidence of the officers who had tested the keys on the bunch of keys, it appeared that the keys from the bunch of seven keys which the appellant had allegedly retrieved from the flower pot just outside the flat to gain access into the flat were also capable of opening the locks at the entrance as well as the room door of the appellant at 2001A Syed Alwi Road. The question was if the entire bunch of keys belonged to Ah Seng, how was it that the keys found in that bunch could also open the door to his room at Syed Alwi Road. The answer from the appellant was that it could also be used to open the door to his room. When asked by the court as to what then happened to his own set of keys to his room at 2001A Syed Alwi Road, the appellant claimed that they were with his friend.
 36.The appellant had said that after packing the heroin found in the metal basin into several sachets using a spoon and the electronic weighing scale, he had left all those items in the room on the floor. However, all those items had been found in the black suitcase by SS/Sgt Wong. He was asked whether he was the one who had placed those items into the black suitcase but he said that he did not. He agreed however, that no other person had the bunch of keys to the flat.
 37.Therefore, the appellant`s submission in the court below was basically that the heroin found in the flat did not belong to him but to Ah Seng instead and whatever heroin found on him were for his own consumption. The defence submitted that prosecution had not thoroughly investigated the existence of Ah Seng and therefore they could not say that he did not exist.
 38.
 Decision below
On a review of all the evidence, leaving aside the appellant`s claim that the five sachets which contained not less than 2.58g of diamorphine were for his own consumption, the trial judge rejected the appellant`s claim that Ah Seng was the real tenant and occupier of the flat and that Ah Seng was the exclusive owner of the heroin.
 39.He felt that prosecution had by direct evidence proved that the appellant was the tenant of the flat. He could not believe that the appellant would only enter the flat to obtain the ten sachets and help pack some sachets for his friend. The trial judge also found it odd that the keys on the bunch of keys could also open the door to the appellant`s room at Syed Alwi Road. He felt that if indeed the appellant had obtained the bunch of keys from under a flower pot, there was no reason to take the keys back with him when he left the flat. He also thought that the presence of the appellant`s bank book there was telling.
 40.The trial judge also did not believe that the appellant had no knowledge of the black suitcase and its contents since only he could have possibly packed the metal basin, spoon and weighing scale into the black suitcase. He also felt that the appellant`s acts in weighing and packing the heroin and being in possession of five sachets on his person led to only one conclusion, ie that the appellant was actively involved in the trafficking of the heroin.
 41.
 The appeal
In the appeal the appellant contended that the trial judge had not adequately considered his defence. A preliminary point was the appellant`s submission that the trial judge erred in law when he allowed the appellant to be tried on a capital charge coupled with a non-capital charge when it is the accepted rule of practice `
 that a capital charge should not generally speaking be coupled with a non-capital charge in the same indictment and that the reason for this rule is that when an accused person is defending himself on a capital charge he ought not in fairness to be required to defend himself on other additional charges at the same trial 
.` The appellant submitted before us that therefore the whole proceeding was a nullity.
 42.The appellant submitted that the rule existed because a capital charge is too serious a matter to be complicated by having alternative counts in the same trial. The appellant relied on the cases of 
Lee Ah Cheong v R
 
[1958] MLJ 242
 and 
Cheng Seng Heng & Ors v PP
 
[1949] MLJ 175
 for this proposition. In 
 Lee Ah Cheong v R 
, there was an appeal against the conviction and sentence of the offences of abduction and the using of a firearm with intent to cause physical injury. The main ground of appeal there was that the jury which tried the case was not summoned according to law. One other matter the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to in that case was the fact that counsel for the appellant had referred to the rule of practice stated in [para ] 41 above which was a rule of practice in England. The court felt that as this rule of practice had long been established in the English courts, it was desirable that it should be followed. This view had also been expressed obiter in
 Cheng Seng Heng 
`s case.
 43.We take cognizance of this rule of practice and agree that it is a sensible rule of practice and is one that has been incorporated into our common law. We felt however that in the present case, the appellant had not suffered any prejudice by the joinder of the capital charge with the non-capital charge. Both the charges against the appellant were drug related except that they were for different quantities, one being an amount sufficient to warrant the death sentence and the other not. We think that the trial judge was right in allowing the appellant to be tried for the two offences together and later for amalgamating them into one charge as there was a nexus in terms of proximity in time and location and both the offences also arose from the same set of facts. Furthermore, the standard of proof and the statutory presumptions are the same for the non-capital drug charge as for the capital drug charge. Both were offences under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Act. Only the difference in the quantities made one a capital charge and the other non-capital.
 44.The joinder did not appear to have caused any prejudice to the appellant`s conduct of his defence. He was able to state clearly his two defences in relation to the amount found on his person and the amount found in the flat. Also, the trial judge did not appear to have reached the conclusion that the appellant was trafficking the larger amount in his flat (the capital charge) merely because he was found with the five sachets of heroin wrapped in a newspaper in his possession (the non-capital charge) earlier.
 45.We feel that in every case, depending on the circumstances, it is for the trial judge to use his discretion as to whether to order separate trials or to order a joinder of the offences. This is provided for in s 171 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). There are express provisions in the CPC to guide the exercise of the trial judge`s discretion. They are ss 169, 170 and 172. Therefore in all cases, the trial judge should bear in mind the rule of practice that a capital charge should not generally speaking be coupled with a non-capital charge in the same trial. However, if the trial judge feels that the circumstances of the case before him falls within one of the provisions of the CPC relating to the joinder of offences in the same trial and thinks that no prejudice is caused to the accused, it is open to him to allow the offences to be tried together even if one is a capital offence and the other is non-capital. It is of utmost importance that the trial judge must determine that no prejudice is caused to the accused.
 46.We were of the opinion that the trial judge was right in rejecting the appellant`s defence as we felt that it was clear that the appellant was the real tenant of the flat and not Ah Seng and therefore the heroin in the flat belonged to the appellant. As the trial judge noted, the undisputed features in this case were (a) the appellant had in his possession the five sachets of heroin wrapped in newspaper which on analysis were found to contain 2.58g of diamorphine; (b) the tenancy of the flat where seven packets and 45 sachets were seized was in his name; (c) he was seen moving into the flat on 13 December 1996; (d) the keys to the flat were in his possession; (e) the appellant knew that the substance he was packing were heroin; and (f) he packed scores of sachets on the day in question.
 47.Furthermore, on analysis of the appellant`s evidence, as noted by the trial judge, there were many inconsistencies which made the defence version highly suspect. It seemed unlikely that if Ah Seng really existed and was staying at Syed Alwi Road, he would have asked the appellant to obtain a flat for him. Also, the appellant`s bank book was in the flat and he had the keys to the flat in his possession, on the same bunch of keys as the keys to his room in Syed Alwi Road. In our opinion, all these pointed to him being the real tenant of the flat. It seemed unlikely that he would enter the flat to pack heroin and that Ah Seng would trust him to just take ten sachets when Ah Seng, if he existed must have known that the appellant was a heroin addict and since heroin was so expensive; the appellant could have taken more. We therefore felt that the trial judge was right to reject the appellant`s defence.
 48.The sheer quantity of the heroin found in the flat coupled with the evidence which clearly proved that the appellant was in possession of it and the hollowness of his explanations in trying to explain away his actions, the presence of his bank book in the flat and feigning ignorance as to how the paraphernalia he had used in repacking the heroin in the sachets and which he left on the floor when he left the flat, mysteriously got into the black suitcase all irresistibly led to the conclusion, as the learned trial judge found, that he was in possession of the 244.35g of diamorphine in the flat as well as the 2.58g of diamorphine contained in the five sachets of heroin found on his person at arrest for the purpose of trafficking which having regard to s 5(2) of the Act is trafficking in heroin.
 49.It was for all these reasons that we dismissed the appeal.",1997-10-22 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

The appellant in this case faced the following charge in the district court: 
You, Foo Tiang Khium, Julian, m/30 years, NRIC No 1654234-B
 
are charged that you, on 2 October 1993, at DBS Bank Ltd, Parkway Parade Branch, Singapore, did cheat one Aileen Choo Siew Tin, the bank teller of the said bank, to wit, by deceiving her into believing that you were authorised to encash a DBS Bank Ltd cash cheque bearing number 832757 dated 24 September 1993 for the sum of $30,000 purportedly issued to you by one Morimasa Okawa, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said Aileen Choo Siew Tin to pay out a total sum of $30,000 in cash to you, which she would not have done had she not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 2.The appellant, who claimed trial, was convicted and sentenced to eight months` imprisonment. He appealed against both conviction and sentence.
 3.
 The facts
The facts of the case are set out at pp 1 to 7 of the district judge`s grounds of decision. The undisputed facts were as follows.
 4.The appellant was formerly employed as the Business Development Manager of a company called Okawa Entertainment Pte Ltd (OEPL), but resigned from the company in July or August 1993. On 2 October 1993 the appellant went to the Parkway Parade branch of DBS Bank Ltd and encashed a cash cheque apparently issued by OEPL for $30,000. This cash cheque - exh P2 - bore what appeared to be the signature and rubber stamp of OEPL`s sole authorised signatory: Chief Executive Officer, Morimasa Okawa (PW3). The appellant asked the bank teller Aileen Choo (Choo) to pay out the money to him in small denominations: `nothing bigger than $100 note`, according to Choo. She did so and the appellant left the bank with the $30,000 cash.
 5.Later it transpired that the cheque P2 was actually a forged cheque. The expert witness from the Department of Scientific Services, one Yap Bei Sing (PW4), testified that the signature on P2 was a `traced forgery`: that is, someone had copied Okawa`s signature onto P2 by tracing from a genuine signature sample. The rubber stamp applied next to the signature was also different from that used by Okawa.
 6.At the close of the prosecution`s case below, the appellant`s counsel declined to make a submission of no case to answer and the district judge accordingly called on the appellant for his defence.
 7.
 The appellant`s defence in the court below
The appellant`s version of the events leading up to his encashment of P2 was a lengthy and somewhat convoluted one. I set out below a summary of his story.
 8.Sometime in late 1992, OEPL decided to develop a discotheque called Scorpion Disco. They approached a firm of designers called Dang Design with the intention of hiring Dang Design to come up with the `concept` for this new discotheque. There were a few meetings between representatives from Dang Design and representatives from OEPL, including Okawa`s girlfriend Jenny Lim.
 9.At one such meeting, in Okawa`s absence, Jenny Lim asked Dang`s wife for some `under-the-table` commission in return for her making sure Dang Design secured the contract with OEPL. The appellant himself was not present at this particular meeting but he was informed of the incident by one Francis Ng (DW6), then a director of OEPL. Subsequently, the appellant personally witnessed Dang giving Jenny a cheque for $30,000.
 10.Later, Dang apparently changed his mind about giving Jenny the `under-the-table` commission. He told Okawa about the matter and Okawa repaid him the $30,000 by way of a personal cheque. After issuing the personal cheque, however, Okawa caused a receipt to be issued to him by OEPL for the same amount. The issuance of such a receipt led to a deficit being shown in the OEPL account known as the `Designer Consulting Fee account`. In view of this deficit, when the appellant handed over to the new Financial Controller (one Takashi Furuhata) the documentation for the Scorpion Disco project, he drew up a document stating inter alia the following (exh D4): 
The discrepancy and over-payment resulting in the excess debit balance in the Design Consulting Fee account of Singapore dollars Thirty Thousand, (S$30,000) shall be explained to our auditors, by the Chairman, Mr M. Okawa, should they query the amount. Please seek Mr Okawa`s advice on this matter.
 11.According to the appellant, he left OEPL at the end of August 1993. Before leaving, he gave Okawa his pager number, on Okawa`s request. He next met up with Okawa sometime in mid-September 1993, at Okawa`s behest. During this meeting, which took place at the Goodwood Park Hotel coffee-house, Okawa told the appellant that the $30,000 deficit in OEPL`s Design Consulting Fee account had to be rectified. Okawa proposed that it be rectified in the following manner: the appellant was to encash the cheque P2 and hand over the money to Okawa, who would use it to credit OEPL`s Design Consulting Fee account. The withdrawal of $30,000 by way of the cheque P2 would in turn be written off `as sundry`.
 12.The appellant claimed that he agreed to do as Okawa asked, firstly because Okawa made veiled threats against the appellant`s sister, who lived in Japan, and the appellant knew Okawa had `Yakuza` connections back in Japan; secondly because Okawa said that the appellant would not be paid his salary for September 1993 if he did not do as Okawa asked. Okawa then handed over the cheque P2 which, according to the appellant, was already signed and stamped. The appellant was instructed to present P2 for encashment only in October 1993. Okawa also stated that he would contact the appellant for the money.
 13.On 1 October 1993 the appellant went to the bank with the cheque P2 but was told that funds due to the relevant OEPL account had not cleared yet. He returned to the bank on 2 October 1993 and succeeded in encashing the cheque on that day. He asked for the money to be paid out in small denominations for `ease of carrying in a bundle`. Having obtained the money, he then waited for Okawa to call him. Instead, it was Okawa`s girlfriend, Jenny, who contacted him a few days later. He met up with Jenny and handed her the $30,000 cash. Jenny warned him that if he `loved [his] girlfriend`, he should not tell anybody about what had happened. He never saw Jenny or the $30,000 again.
 14.The appellant was very frightened by the threats made by Okawa and Jenny. For that reason, when he was arrested by the police in November 1993 and asked to make a statement pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), he did not say anything at first about the events which had led to his encashing the cheque P2. Instead, he denied that he had ever seen P2 and stated that Okawa was falsely trying to accuse [him] because of his `friendship with the suppliers and contractors involved in the development of Scorpion Discotheque` and also because of his association with Francis Ng (who had been convicted of cheating).
 15.Having denied anything to do with the cheque P2, the appellant went on to add that whilst working at OEPL, he had `uncovered a case of cheating` involving the payment of $30,000 `under table money` to Jenny Lim. He stated that the matter of the $30,000 taken by Jenny Lim was `unresolved`; that this remained a deficit in OPEL`s books; and that this was the sum he was accused of taking.
 16.The above is a summary of the appellant`s first s 122(6) statement (exh D1). The recording of this first statement commenced at 1.30am on 11 November 1997 and ended at 2.10am.
 17.At 2.20am, the appellant asked to make an additional statement. In this additional statement, he related the meeting with Okawa which led to his being given the cheque P2 and his being told to encash it. It should be noted that the appellant did not mention the threats allegedly made by Okawa against his sister. He stated only that Okawa had said he (the appellant) was the only one who could help Okawa. He did, however, mention the threat made by Jenny when she collected the money from him.
 18.When cross-examined about the discrepancies between the above two statements, the appellant claimed that the second statement was true whereas the first was not. He explained that he had not told the truth in the first statement because he was afraid of what Okawa might do to his family. According to him, however, after making the first statement, he asked the recording officer ASP Pang Joo Keng (PW5) for `assurance that nothing would happen to [his] family if [he] told the truth`. He decided to make the second statement after receiving the assurance.
 19.The appellant suggested that Okawa might have wanted to frame him by alleging forgery of the cheque P2. He put forward several reasons why Okawa might have had such an intention. The first two reasons related to the appellant`s role in uncovering the $30,000 deficit in OEPL`s Designer Consulting Fee account, which incident (so the appellant claimed) had subjected Okawa to much embarrassment. The appellant also suggested that Okawa had been `furious` with him after he took a telephone message from the Tokyo branch of Citibank regarding Okawa`s mortgage with Citibank. Finally, the appellant said that Okawa disliked him associating with Francis Ng.
 20.
 The prosecution`s response to the appellant`s defence
The key aspects of the appellant`s story were denied by the prosecution. Okawa denied either meeting with the appellant in September 1993 or giving him the cheque P2. Okawa was not able to shed any light on how the cheque might have come into the appellant`s possession. He said he had only discovered something was amiss in November 1993, when he received OEPL`s bank statement.
 21.ASP Pang denied that the appellant had asked him for assurance regarding the safety of his (the appellant`s) family or that he had given the appellant such assurance. He said that the appellant had been `eager` to give the statement.
 22.The prosecution initially also declared its intention of calling Jenny Lim for rebuttal evidence. Unfortunately, she proved to be untraceable for the length of the trial.
 23.
 The district judge`s decision
In his written grounds of decision, the district judge noted the following: 
It was clear that the following facts were either not disputed or there was ample evidence to establish them. These facts were: 
(1) the accused had gone to the said bank on 2 October 1993 and encashed the cheque P2; 
(2) the accused had asked for the amount to be paid in various denominations; 
(3) the cheque P2 was a forgery in that the signature was forged and the stamp used was different from the one which was used by Okawa; 
(4) the bank teller had paid out the cash on [sic] the belief the cheque was authorised.
 
That being the case, it was for the accused to give a reasonable explanation as to how he came to be in possession of the forged cheque and that in presenting it for payment he did not have knowledge of this forgery At the end of it all, I was of the view the issue was one of credibility.
 24.The district judge concluded that Okawa `was a witness of truth` whereas the appellant was `unreliable` and his defence a `fabrication`.
 25.
 The appeal against conviction
At the hearing of the appeal before me, the appellant`s counsel submitted that the district judge had misdirected himself on the burden of proof borne by the parties during the trial in holding that `it was for the accused to give a reasonable explanation as to how he came to be in possession of the forged cheque and that in presenting it for payment he did not have knowledge of this forgery`.
 26.Counsel further argued that the district judge had in any event erred in his evaluation of the evidence before him; and that the evidence in fact showed the appellant`s story to be a `reasonable and credible` one. Much attention was focused by counsel on the history of the cheque P2 insofar as this could be ascertained from the testimony of witnesses: counsel stressed that the prosecution had not shown how the appellant had come into possession of the cheque in the first place.
 27.I should add that, prior to the hearing of the appeal proper, counsel actually applied for an adjournment. According to counsel, he had just learnt from Japanese newspaper accounts that Okawa had been charged in Japan with offences involving breach of trust. The trial of these charges was due to be completed in March 1998; and, in counsel`s submission, information about the outcome of the trial would assist the appellate court in assessing Okawa`s credibility. I was satisfied, however, that the evidence contained in the records of proceedings provided a more than adequate basis on which to assess the credibility of the witnesses: in particular, it should be pointed out that the district judge did not stop either the appellant or Francis Ng from testifying about Okawa`s alleged criminal connections in Japan. I did not see, therefore, that this latest piece of information would add anything to my evaluation of Okawa`s credibility. Accordingly I rejected the application for an adjournment.
 28.Having considered the arguments put before me and having reviewed the notes of evidence, I have reached the view that not only was the evidence adduced by the prosecution sufficient to make out a prima facie case against the appellant at the close of its case below, it was also sufficient to warrant the appellant`s conviction at the conclusion of the trial. I am further of the view that the district judge did not in any way misdirect himself as to the burden of proof borne by the parties before him.
 29.
 The essential elements of the offence charged
The charge against the appellant alleged that he cheated Aileen Choo by deceiving her into believing that he was authorised to encash the cheque P2; and that by such deception, he dishonestly induced Choo to pay out $30,000 in cash to him, which she would not have done had she not been so deceived. In my opinion, the prosecution had to prove the following essential elements of the offence: (a). that the appellant presented the cheque P2 for encashment;
 (b). that the appellant induced Choo to believe that he was authorised to present the cheque;
 (c). that but for such belief, Choo would not have paid out the $30,000 cash to the appellant;
 (d). that Choo did pay out the $30,000 to the appellant;
 (e). that the appellant did not in fact have the authority to present the cheque for encashment; and
 (f). that the appellant intended to deceive Choo in that he knew he had no such authority.
 30.In considering the prosecution`s success in discharging its burden of proof in respect of the above elements, I examined first the evidence which lay before the court at the close of the prosecution`s case below.
 31.
 Whether the prosecution succeeded in establishing a prima facie case against the appellant at the close of its case below
At the close of its case during the trial below, the prosecution had to ensure that it had adduced evidence which was `not inherently incredible and which, if it were accepted as accurate, would establish each essential element` in the offence charged: 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  [1980-1981] SLR 73 . An assessment of the credibility of each witness was unnecessary at this stage.
 32.
 Presentation of the cheque
So far as item (a) in [para ] 29 is concerned, there is no dispute that the appellant presented the cheque for encashment on 2 October 1993.
 33.
 Inducement of belief in Choo that the appellant was authorised to present the cheque; payment out of moneys by Choo pursuant to said belief
So far as items (b) and (c) in [para ] 29 are concerned, it was said in the appellant`s written submissions that Choo had failed to give any evidence to the effect that she `would not have paid the cash of $30,000 if she had not been deceived to pay the cash by a forged cheque`. The appellant`s complaint in this respect seems to be that the prosecution never expressly asked Choo to state in court her belief that the appellant had possessed the requisite authority to present the cheque for encashment, nor did they get her to state specifically that she would not have paid out the moneys but for such belief.
 34.In my judgment, this complaint is spurious. It is not disputed that the appellant presented the cheque P2 to Choo for encashment. On any sensible view of the transaction, it must be inferred that, in the very act of presenting the cheque, the appellant represented to Choo his authority to encash it. Choo clearly believed this representation and was induced by it to pay out the $30,000 to the appellant. In her statement (exh PS1), Choo said that she recognised the appellant; even more significantly, that she recognised him as a staff of OEPL. She further checked the signature on the cheque against the specimen maintained by the bank and concluded that it was genuine. Only then did she proceed to pay out the monies. From this evidence, it is plain to me that the reasonable - indeed, the only - inference to be drawn is that Choo would not have paid out the $30,000 but for her belief that the appellant possessed the requisite authority to encash the cheque P2.
 35.So far as item (d) in [para ] 29 is concerned, this is not disputed.
 36.
 Absence of authority on appellant`s part to present the cheque for encashment
So far as item (e) is concerned, Okawa testified that he had never signed the cheque P2, nor had he given it to the appellant. Yap Bei Sing, the expert witness, testified that the signature on the cheque P2 was a forgery. The evidence of these two men, when taken together, clearly points to the absence of any authority on the appellant`s part to present the cheque for encashment.
 37.I am aware, of course, that in cross-examining Yap Bei Sing, the appellant`s counsel attempted to suggest that the signature on P2 might be `disguised handwriting`. Counsel clearly intended to imply that it was Okawa himself who had signed the cheque using `disguised handwriting`. This submission was made during counsel`s arguments at the close of the trial below and again on appeal. I decided, however, that it should not be given any weight. It does not appear to have been anything more than half-hearted speculation: counsel`s attempt in this respect went no further than the single suggestion made to Yap Bei Sing at p 46 of the notes of evidence. The allegation of `disguised handwriting` was never put to Okawa himself. In the written submissions presented at the appeal, counsel contended that the prosecution was to be blamed for this omission because Yap Bei Sing`s report was tendered in court only after Okawa had finished giving his evidence. Again, I find this a spurious complaint. The appellant`s position throughout the trial below was that he had received the cheque from Okawa and that the entire fiasco was an attempt by Okawa to frame him. These being presumably his instructions to his counsel, the allegation of `disguised handwriting` could have and indeed should have been put to Okawa during cross-examination: there was no reason why counsel`s questions in this respect had to wait upon Yap Bei Sing`s report.
 38.
 Mens rea on appellant`s part: knowledge of absence of authority
So far as item (f) in [para ] 29 is concerned, at the close of the prosecution`s case, the court below had before it the following items of evidence.
 39.First, when the appellant presented the cheque P2 for encashment, he was no longer an OEPL employee. There is some disagreement as to whether he tendered his resignation in July 1993 (as the prosecution claimed) or in August 1993 (as the appellant himself claimed), but this is not of material significance: what is crucial is the fact that, as at 2 October 1993, the appellant was no longer in OEPL`s employ, yet he was in possession of an OEPL cash cheque made out for the not inconsiderable sum of $30,000.
 40.Secondly, Okawa, who was the sole authorised signatory for OEPL cheques, said he had not issued the cheque P2. According to the expert witness, Yap Bei Sing, the signature on the cheque was a forgery.
 41.Thirdly, Okawa denied giving the appellant P2. PW2, Chia Kum Wah, who served as OEPL`s accounts executive between 25 September 1993 and early December 1993 and who had custody of OEPL`s chequebooks, clearly did not give the appellant P2 either.
 42.Fourthly, the appellant asked for the $30,000 to be paid in small denominations: as Choo said, `(n)othing bigger than $100 note`.
 43.In my opinion, the above four items of evidence, taken together, sufficed to constitute evidence of the element of guilty knowledge on the appellant`s part. It must be remembered that the deceit alleged in the charge against the appellant consisted of his having induced Choo to believe that he had the authority to encash P2. The corresponding mens rea must consist, therefore, of knowledge on his part that he in fact lacked such authority. The first three items of evidence set out above showed that the appellant was in possession of a forged cash cheque from his former company OEPL; further, that neither the chief executive officer nor the accounts executive of OEPL had given the appellant the cheque. In other words, the circumstances in which the appellant came to be in possession of the cheque were suspicious; and a reasonable inference which could be drawn from these suspicious circumstances was that the appellant knew he had no authority to present the cheque for encashment. This was bolstered by the fourth item of evidence, namely, his request that the $30,000 be paid in small denominations. A reasonable inference to be drawn from this request is, surely, that being aware of his own lack of authority, he wished to evade detection by collecting the moneys in denominations which were more common and correspondingly less easily traceable.
 44.I should emphasise that at the stage when it closed its case, the prosecution did not have to go any further than this to establish guilty intention: only a `minimum evaluation` approach was required towards the evidence at this stage. As LP Thean J put it in 
Tan Siew Chay v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
 : 
In considering whether the prosecution has made out a case against the accused, we have to adopt the approach as laid down by Lord Diplock [in 
 Haw Tua Tau
] We assume (a) that the evidence on the primary facts is true, unless the evidence is inherently incredible, and (b) that there will be nothing to displace the inferences as to further facts or the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation. 
 The application of limb (b) necessarily involves the court drawing inferences from the primary facts, and in drawing such inferences the court looks at the totality of the evidence and considers what inference, if any, that can reasonably be drawn therefrom. But in considering any inference to be drawn the court at this stage does not apply the test whether the evidence looked at in its totality would inevitably and inexorably lead to only one inference or inferences for establishing the essential elements of the charge
. [Emphasis added.]
 45.I should also add that although the DPP below laid some emphasis on the appellant`s physical appearance on 2 October 1993 (specifically, on the fact that he wore a cap and had his right hand in a bandage), I do not think any weight can be given to this factor in considering the evidence adduced in respect of the appellant`s guilty intention. I presume the DPP was trying to suggest that the appellant had made an attempt at disguising himself, but unfortunately this allegation was never directly put to the appellant himself. In any event, I do not find the wearing of the cap and the bandage particularly suspicious conduct in itself.
 46.
 Summary
Having regard to the above reasoning, I find that the prosecution did successfully make out a prima facie case against the appellant at the close of its case in the trial below.
 47.
 Whether the prosecution succeeded in proving its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt
I deal next with the question of whether, having established a prima facie case against the appellant, the prosecution succeeded in proving its case beyond reasonable doubt. In this respect, it will be necessary to consider the credibility of the witnesses.
 48.
 Presentation of the cheque; inducement of belief in Choo that the appellant had authority to present the cheque; payment out by Choo pursuant to said belief
So far as the elements set out at items (a) to (d) in [para ] 29 are concerned, there was no real challenge to the evidence produced by the prosecution even at the conclusion of the trial.
 49.
 Absence of authority on appellant`s part
So far as item (e) is concerned, as noted earlier, the version of events given by the appellant when called on for his defence was diametrically opposed to the prosecution`s version. The appellant claimed he had the authority to encash the cheque P2 because Okawa himself had given him this cheque with instructions to encash it in October 1993. This was flatly denied by Okawa. The district judge chose to believe Okawa whilst describing the appellant`s evidence as `absurd`, unbelievable and a `fabrication`. In the written submissions tendered at the appeal, the appellant`s counsel sought to challenge the district judge`s evaluation of his evidence by relying once more on the evidence of DW3, one Ong Chin Hup. Ong`s evidence was that sometime `after 15 September 1993`, he saw the appellant `with a male Japanese or Korean` at the Goodwood Park Hotel coffee-house. The appellant contends that this corroborates his story of the meeting with Okawa in mid-September 1993, at which meeting Okawa allegedly gave him the cheque P2.
 50.These arguments, in my view, cannot stand. I agree with the district judge that Ong`s evidence was wholly unhelpful. All that Ong actually said came to this: sometime in September 1993, he saw the appellant at the Goodwood Park Hotel coffee-house with a man who looked like a Japanese or a Korean. Ong did not identify Okawa as the man he had seen. Nor did he speak to the appellant or to this man: indeed, it was plain from his testimony that he only saw them for a few moments. It is difficult to see, therefore, how his evidence provides corroboration in any way for the appellant`s story about his meeting with Okawa.
 51.I also agree with the district judge that Ong`s evidence was not reliable. On his own testimony, he only got a few minutes` look at the appellant and the `Japanese or Korean` man. This was in September 1993. Yet, at the appellant`s trial more than two years later, he claimed to be able to recognise the `Japanese or Korean` man and he even insisted on describing this man`s physical appearance. Given the extremely brief nature of Ong`s encounter with the `Japanese or Korean` man and the length of time elapsed since that encounter, Ong`s self-proclaimed powers of observation and recollection must surely be suspect.
 52.The appellant also argues that the combined evidence of Victor Sei (DW5) and Francis Ng should have led the district judge to inquire whether the signature on P2 might have been made by Okawa himself. I cannot see any reason for the district judge to pursue such an inquiry. As noted earlier, the appellant`s counsel did not at any point put this allegation to Okawa in the course of cross-examination. Given such a crucial omission, the appellant could scarcely complain if the district judge chose to accord little or no weight to the half-baked suggestion that the forgery might have been engineered by Okawa himself.
 53.Both counsel for the appellant and the DPP stressed that this case depended, in the final analysis, on the relative credibility of the prosecution witnesses and the appellant himself. Certainly, proof of the element of absence of authority depended on whom the district judge chose to believe: whether he chose to believe the appellant who said that Okawa had given him the cheque P2, or whether he chose to believe Okawa who denied doing any such thing. Both Okawa and the appellant were subject to detailed, often tedious, cross-examination during the trial. The district judge had, accordingly, ample opportunity to observe their demeanour in the witness stand and to form his own views as to their credibility. He clearly felt the appellant to be an untrustworthy witness: indeed, he went so far as to agree with the prosecution that the appellant`s tears in the witness stand amounted to nothing more than `play-acting`. I am disinclined to interfere with his evaluation of the witnesses` credibility; and indeed, having reviewed the notes of evidence, I see no basis for such interference. I too find the appellant`s version of events contrived and glib; and I am unable to accept that he was the victim of some fantastic scheme of revenge devised by Okawa.
 54.In my judgment, therefore, the district judge was entirely justified in preferring Okawa`s evidence to the appellant`s; and I am satisfied that the element of absence of authority was proved beyond reasonable doubt at the conclusion of the trial.
 55.
 Mens rea on appellant`s part: knowledge of absence of authority
I come, then, to the final element, that of guilty intention. As pointed out in [para ] 29, the prosecution had to show that the appellant knew he had no authority to present the cheque for encashment. I have already set out at [para ] 39 to 42 the four main items of evidence which existed in this respect at the close of the prosecution`s case. It is plain that such evidence as existed of the appellant`s state of mind was entirely circumstantial. As such, the proper test which should be applied at the conclusion of the trial is that described by the trial judge (and endorsed by the Federal Court) in 
Ang Sunny v PP
 
 
[1966] 2 MLJ 195
  [1965-1968] SLR 67 : 
(O)ne of the points about circumstantial evidence is its cumulative effect. Any one of these points taken alone might be capable of explanation. The question for you is: where does the totality of them, the total effect of them, all lead you to? Adding them together, considering them, not merely each one in itself, but altogether, does it or does it not lead you to the irresistible inference and conclusion that the accused committed this crime? Or is there some other reasonable explanation of those facts?
 56.Bearing in mind the above formulation, I do not think it can be said that the district judge was wrong to ask that the appellant supply a `reasonable explanation as to how he came to be in possession of the forged cheque`. The appellant`s explanation, of course, was that Okawa had given him the cheque with instructions to get it encashed. However, as pointed out above, the district judge did not find the appellant`s story to be a reasonable or even a credible explanation: he rejected it entirely. As such, the irresistible conclusion which one is left to draw from the four items of evidence set out in [para ] 39 to 42 must be that the appellant obtained the cheque P2 in suspicious circumstances and that he was well aware of the absence of any authority on his part to encash the cheque.
 57.Counsel for the appellant argued that the district judge `ought to have made a finding of fact regarding the person who made the signature and placed the stamp impression on the cheque`. It was said that without such a finding, the district judge was `not able to make a finding of fact that the appellant was the person who had done so or knew the cheque was a forged cheque`. Unfortunately, counsel did not manage to explain why this should be so. The appellant was not charged with forgery of the cheque, so why should it be necessary for the district judge to make a specific finding as to the identity of the forger?
 58.Counsel also argued that the district judge should have required the prosecution to spell out the exact manner in which the appellant came into possession of the cheque. Again, however, no satisfactory explanation was given as to why this was necessary. If I may reiterate: at the close of the prosecution`s case, there already existed evidence from which it could reasonably be inferred - assuming the absence of any other reasonable explanation - that the appellant was aware of his own lack of authority. The explanation which the appellant proffered upon being called for his defence was rejected by the district judge as a complete `fabrication`. On an application of the 
 Ang Sunny 
 test, once the district judge rejected the appellant`s story about having obtained the cheque from Okawa, the only inference which could be drawn from the four items of evidence referred to in [para ] 39 to 42 was that the appellant knew he had no authority to present the cheque for encashment. Since this inference of guilty knowledge was warranted by the existing evidence, a detailed exposition of the manner in which the appellant got his hands on the cheque was simply inessential to the prosecution`s case; and counsel`s constant harping on this point really constituted a red herring.
 59.In any event, once the district judge had accepted Okawa`s denial of the appellant`s story, I do not see what more the prosecution could have done to prove the appellant`s lack of authority or his guilty knowledge. Certainly they can scarcely have been expected to put all OEPL staff on the witness stand and to extract from each a statement to the effect that he had not given the appellant P2!
 60.
 The appeal against sentence
As to the appeal against sentence, counsel for the appellant argued that the sentence of eight months` imprisonment was manifestly excessive. I should point out, however, that the maximum custodial sentence possible under s 420 of the Penal Code is seven years. In meting out the sentence of eight months, the district judge stated that the usual punishment for an offence of cheating - given the sum involved - was 12 months` imprisonment. He gave the appellant a shorter term in consideration of the appellant`s first offender status and his previous good character. It is a term which is comparable to the sentences meted out in other cheating cases within the last few years; and I do not find it manifestly excessive.
 61.In the light of the foregoing reasons, the appeal against conviction and sentence is dismissed.",1997-10-28 00:00:00,SG High Court

 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): On 3 October 1997 we ordered that the respondent be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors. We now give our reasons for doing so.
 2.The respondent was convicted in the subordinate courts on the following charge, in DAC No 12838/95: 
You, Narinder Singh s/o Malagar Singh, are charged that you in conjunction with one Hartej Singh Sidhu, a condemned prisoner, on 18 May 1995, at or about 5pm, at Changi Prison, Jalan Awan, Singapore, did corruptly solicit for the family of the said Hartej Singh Sidhu, a gratification, to wit, a sum of $100,000 from one Baldev Singh, the son of another condemned prisoner, Sarjit Singh s/o Anokh Singh, on account of Hartej Singh Sidhu exonerating the said Sarjit Singh s/o Anokh Singh by his signed statement, to wit,
 
`I, Hartej Singh c/o Changi Prison Cond No 476/93 hereby state that Sarjit Singh c/o Changi Prison Cond No 477/93 is innocent and was not involved in the drug trafficking transaction. The transaction was done by me solely.`
 
of any complicity in the drug trafficking transaction concerned in Criminal Case No 52 of 1991 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed).
 3.The learned district judge, in his grounds of decision dated 4 May 1996, found the following facts. One Hartej Singh (Hartej) had been convicted and sentenced to death for drug trafficking together with one Sarjit Singh (Sarjit). Their clemency petitions to the President had been rejected and they were to be executed on 19 May 1995. The respondent as assigned counsel represented Hartej in his unsuccessful appeal to the Court of Appeal and his clemency petition. Sarjit was represented by another lawyer, NK Rajah (Rajah).
 4.On 18 May 1995, the day before the execution, the respondent and Rajah were asked to see their clients in Changi Prison by Sarjit`s relatives who were hopeful that Hartej would make a confession which would save Sarjit from execution. After both lawyers had arrived at the prison, Hartej initially refused to make a confession. However, he later signed a confession drafted by Rajah (in the terms described above in the charge against the respondent) and handed it to the respondent. The lawyers then left the prison along with Sarjit`s relatives. As they were walking out, the respondent told Rajah that his instructions were not to hand over the confession unless a sum of $100,000 was paid to Hartej`s family.
 5.At a waiting area outside the main gate of the prison, the respondent asked Rajah and one Baldev Singh (Baldev), Sarjit`s son, to come over to him. The respondent again said that his instruction from Hartej was not to hand over the confession until a sum of $100,000 was paid to Hartej`s family. Baldev was shocked at the amount and asked if there was any guarantee that the confession would save his father from execution. The respondent told him there was no such guarantee. Rajah dissuaded Baldev from accepting the respondent`s offer, telling him that it would not save his father because of the other evidence which had been adduced against him at his trial.
 6.On the evening of that day, Baldev visited the respondent in his office to seek his help in staying the execution. The respondent asked him if his family had agreed to Hartej`s demand. In response to Baldev`s queries, the respondent again told him that there was no guarantee that the confession would save Sarjit from execution. The respondent suggested that Baldev contact Rajah for help, whereupon they tried in vain to contact Rajah. Baldev eventually left the respondent`s office without the confession.
 7.In convicting the respondent on the charge, the district judge also found that the respondent had never believed in the truth of the confession. The respondent`s evidence was that Sarjit was more culpable and in fact the possibility was that Hartej was innocent. The district judge rejected the respondent`s argument that he was a mere conduit for his client`s offer, finding that he was concerned as to who between Hartej and Sarjit should take the blame so that a last minute stay of execution could be applied for, and that he played a role in the discussion with Rajah which resulted in the signing of the confession. He acted in combination with Hartej to make the offer to Sarjit`s family and to ensure that the confession was not released until after the money was paid. The district judge concluded by holding that the trading of money for confessions undermined the administration of justice and was a corrupt transaction caught by s 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed); he thus convicted the respondent and sentenced him to five months` imprisonment.
 8.The respondent`s appeal to the High Court was dismissed. In a written judgment delivered on 15 October 1996, the learned Chief Justice found no reason to disturb the district judge`s findings of fact, and dismissed various issues of law raised by the respondent. The Chief Justice further enhanced the respondent`s sentence to 12 months` imprisonment.
 9.Subsequently, the Law Society applied by ex parte originating summons under s 94A of the the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1994 Ed) (LPA) for an order that the respondent be made to show cause why he should not be dealt with under s 83 of the LPA. The order was granted by the Honourable Judicial Commissioner Lim Teong Qwee on 16 May 1997.
 10.At the show cause hearing before us, counsel for the respondent informed us that he had been instructed not to make submissions to us, as the respondent was throwing himself at the mercy of this court.
 11.Section 83(5) of the LPA provides: 
In any proceedings instituted under this Part against an advocate and solicitor consequent upon his conviction for a criminal offence, an Inquiry Committee, a Disciplinary Committee appointed under s 90 and a court of 3 judges of the Supreme Court referred to in section 98 shall accept his conviction as final and conclusive.
 Accordingly, the question before us was what consequences should flow from the fact that the respondent had been convicted of the charge.
 12.Sections 83(1) and (2) of the LPA state, inter alia: 
(1) All advocates and solicitors shall be subject to the control of the Supreme Court and shall be liable on due cause being shown to be struck off the roll or suspended from practice for any period not exceeding 5 years or censured. 
(2) Such due cause may be shown by proof that an advocate and solicitor -
 
(a) has been convicted of a criminal offence, implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession; 
 
 13.It was clear to us that the respondent`s conviction under the Prevention of Corruption Act was a conviction which fell within the meaning of s 83(2)(a). His willingness to assist Hartej in essentially getting a bribe in return for a confession implied a defect of character which made him unfit to be a solicitor.
 14.The only remaining issue was thus the penalty to be imposed on the respondent. In this regard, some observations of the learned district judge in his grounds of decision were relevant: 
There were several aggravating factors in the accused`s case. He was a senior lawyer, having been called to the bar in 1975 and having been practising on his own since 1981. He was a senior police officer, having joined the police force in 1975 as a probationary officer; obtained the rank of inspector a year or two later; and having been promoted to probationary ASP in 1980. He left the force in 1981 He had been enforcing the law and as an investigating officer, he must have been involved in recording statements. He had committed the offence while he was carrying out his professional duties assigned to him by the Registrar of the Supreme Court to assist a condemned prisoner to prepare his petition for clemency to the President of the Republic of Singapore. This was a highly responsible job entrusted to him. His offence must be viewed very seriously and a deterrent sentence was warranted.
 15.The learned Chief Justice, when considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the respondent, said in his grounds of decision: 
As a senior member of the Bar and a former police officer, the appellant should have been all the more keenly aware of the need to guard against any abuse of our judicial system. I find his conduct shocking and reprehensible.
 16.We noted that there were some mitigating factors. There was no evidence that he would have obtained any benefit from the transaction; the money was being sought for Hartej`s family and not for the respondent. It was possible that the idea of asking for payment for the confession did not originate from him, and that he was merely carrying out in the difficult circumstances the last instructions of a condemned client.
 17.However, it was clear that the respondent`s conduct had been well below the standard to be expected of an advocate and solicitor. The respondent was willing to help Hartej ask for money in return for providing a confession, while acting in his capacity as a solicitor. Regardless of the probable futility of the confession as far as saving Sarjit was concerned, such conduct was inimical to the administration of justice, by tilting the balance in favour of those who can afford to pay for evidence. The respondent`s request for money must have been shocking and distressing to the relatives of Sarjit, who were desperate to save him from execution and who must have endured much anxiety over whether to accept the respondent`s offer, despite the advice from Rajah that the confession would not save him. Moreover, if the respondent knew that Hartej`s confession was untrue, he should have firmly advised Hartej against making it; instead he was willing, upon payment by Sarjit`s relatives, to have allowed them to send it to the relevant authorities for a stay of execution, which again might have prejudiced the fair administration of justice. The respondent, as Hartej`s solicitor, bore a heavy responsibility in acting for him in his clemency petition to the President, and also owed a duty to act fairly and honourably to Sarjit; but he appeared to have acted with a cavalier disregard for these responsibilities.
 18.We were thus of the view that striking the respondent off the rolls was the only suitable penalty in this case, and we accordingly made the order. We also ordered that the respondent pay the Law Society the costs of these proceedings.",1997-10-28 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant was convicted on the following two amended charges: 
First charge
 
You, Tan Pin Seng, are charged that you on 22 April 1995 at about midnight at Blk 11 Ghim Moh Road #03-70, Singapore did use criminal force on [PW2] female 22 years old, intending to or knowing it likely to outrage her modesty, to wit, by using your hand to stroke her legs and buttocks, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
Second charge
 
You, Tan Pin Seng, are charged that sometime on a day in April 1995, sometime during the night at Blk 11 Ghim Moh Road #03-70, Singapore, did intrude into the privacy of [PW2] female 22 years old, to wit, by peeping through a hole in the bathroom door while she was having a shower, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 2.The appellant was sentenced to five months` imprisonment on the first charge and one month`s imprisonment on the second charge, both sentences to run concurrently. The appellant appealed against both the convictions and the sentences. I dismissed the appeals against both convictions and the sentence on the first charge but reduced the sentence on the second charge. I now give my reasons.
 
 The prosecution`s case
PW2 (the victim)
 3.The mainstay of the prosecution`s case was the evidence of PW2. She testified that she had rented a room from the appellant and moved in on 31 March 1995. One evening in April 1995 (she could not remember the exact date and time), while she was taking a shower in the bathroom, she noticed that her towel, which was thrown over the bathroom door, was being pulled to one side. This exposed a hole in the bathroom door which had hitherto been covered by the towel. The appellant was peeping at her through the hole. She tried to cover the hole with the towel, but the towel was again pulled to one side. She re-covered the hole with the towel. This time nothing happened. She saw the shadow of someone moving outside. She finished showering and came out of the bathroom. The appellant was in the sitting room. There was no one else in the flat. She had not confronted the appellant over the incident as she had been afraid to do so.
 4.PW2 later discovered that the locking device on her door had been damaged. However, she could not remember the exact date on which she first discovered this. She was now unable to lock her door. She suspected that the lock had been deliberately damaged by the appellant. She lodged a police report in respect of the peeping incident on 21 April 1995.
 5.On 22 April 1995, at around midnight, PW2 was sleeping in her room when she was awoken by someone stroking her thighs and buttocks. She was lying on her side and facing the wall. She turned around and saw the appellant lying on the bed beside her. She was shocked and shouted at him to get out. The appellant swore at her in Hokkien before leaving. She was humiliated and outraged by the incident.
 6.On 23 April 1995, PW2 was again sleeping in her room when she was awoken by someone pulling her hair. The appellant was lying on the bed with his head next to hers. She shouted at him and once again the appellant swore at her in Hokkien before leaving the room.
 7.PW2 did not return to the appellant`s flat on 24 April 1995. PW2 lodged a police report in respect of these two incidents on 27 April 1995. She moved her belongings out of the appellant`s flat a few days later.
 8.On 16 Feb 1996, PW2 accompanied PW1 (Sgt Gunasegarar, the investigating officer) and PW7 (Sgt Sardar Singh, the police photographer) to the appellant`s flat to identify the hole in the bathroom door. The bathroom door looked like it had been freshly painted and the hole was not visible from the outside. She went into the bathroom and examined the other side of door. She found `something like plaster, like some kind of tape, sticker tape` covering the hole. She removed the tape and handed it over to PW1. He used his pen to make the hole visible, and photographs were taken of the hole.
 PW3
 9.PW3 was PW2`s boyfriend in 1995. He testified that towards the end of April, PW2 had told him that the appellant had peeped at her through a hole in the bathroom door while she was bathing and that he had gone into her room on two consecutive nights. On the first night, the appellant had come into her room and caressed her buttocks and thighs. She had woken up and shouted at him to leave. The following night, the appellant had again come into her room and caressed her hair. She had ordered the appellant to leave the room. The appellant had sworn at her in Hokkien. PW2 also said that when she first moved in, she could lock the door from inside her room. Subsequently, the lock had been damaged and she had been unable to lock her door on the two nights the accused had entered her room.
 10.PW3 advised PW2 to make a police report and accompanied her to the police station on 27 April 1995.
 PW4
 11.PW4 and PW2 were good friends. She testified that towards the end of April, PW2 had told her that the appellant had gone into her room and touched her at night. PW2 had told her the details of the incidents but she could not remember them. PW2 also said that the lock on her door had been damaged only after she had moved in.
 PW6
 12.PW6 and PW2 worked as cashiers in the same restaurant in March and April 1995. PW6 testified that she had accompanied PW2 back to the appellant`s flat on two occasions. On the second occasion, PW2 had told her that the lock on her door had been damaged so that she could no longer lock her door, and that she suspected that the appellant had damaged the lock. PW2 subsequently resigned from her job. When she returned to collect her paycheck, she told PW6 that the appellant was a pervert who had peeped at her through a hole in the bathroom door while she was bathing. He had also come into her room while she was asleep and she had shouted at him to leave the room. She had therefore been forced to move out.
 PW1
 13.PW1 had taken over as investigating officer on 27 April 1995. The appellant was arrested on 22 May 1995 and made a s 121 statement on 22 May 1995. On 6 June 1995, PW1 went to the appellant`s flat with PW7 to take photographs of the scene. PW1 also verifed that the door leading to PW2`s room could not be locked as the lock was damaged. PW1 checked the bathroom door but could not find a hole in it. On 5 October 1995, PW1 recorded a further s 121 statement from the appellant. Later that day, PW1 went alone to the appellant`s flat and took three photographs of the damaged lock. On 3 January 1996, PW1 interviewed PW2 regarding the hole in the bathroom door. On 18 January 1996, he recorded yet another s 121 statement from the appellant.
 14.On 16 Feb 1996, PW1 went to the appellant`s flat for a third time, accompanied by PW2 and PW7. He asked them to wait in the corrider while he asked the appellant for permission to let PW2 into the premises. He then went into the flat and spoke to the appellant. He told the appellant that he could be present during the investigations. The appellant declined and said that he would stay in his bedroom. PW1 then brought PW2 and PW7 to the bathroom and asked PW2 to point out the hole in the bathroom door. PW2 went into the bathroom and looked at the door from the inside before emerging to point out a spot on the door. PW1 thought that PW2 had pointed to a rivet, but after poking at the spot with his pen, he realised that there was indeed a hole in the door which had been painted over. He instructed PW7 to take a photograph of the hole. PW2 left the flat. PW1 then called the appellant in to view the hole in the bathroom door. The appellant denied any knowledge of the hole and said that it must have been the work of a previous tenant. On 14 March 1996, PW1 went to the appellant`s flat again and took four more photographs of the bathroom door. On 4 April 1996, PW1 learned that the appellant had filed a complaint alleging that he had fabricated evidence against the appellant.
 PW7
 15.PW7 was a police photographer. On 6 June 1995, he accompanied PW1 to the appellant`s flat and took photographs of the bathroom door. They had examined the door but had been unable to find a hole. There was a fresh coat of paint on the door. On 16 February 1996, he had accompanied PW1 and PW2 to the appellant`s flat. PW1 had entered the flat first. PW7 remained in the corrider with PW2. PW1 returned and asked them to enter the flat. The appellant was in one of the bedrooms. PW1 asked PW2 to point out the hole in the bathroom door. PW2 went into the bathroom and examined the door. She came out and pointed to a spot on the bathroom door. There was no hole visible at this time. PW1 poked at the spot with his pen and uncovered a hole. PW1 drew a circle round the hole and instructed PW7 to take photographs of the hole.
 16.
 The defence
The appellant denied committing the offences. In relation to the peeping charge, he claimed that there had not been a hole in bathroom door at the time of the alleged offence and that the hole which had been found was the result of a fabrication of evidence perpetrated by PW1. As for the charge of outrage of modesty, he claimed that PW2 had not even been in the flat on the night of the alleged offence.
 17.The appellant gave evidence in his own defence. He was a retired police officer. PW2 was introduced to him by DW2, a housing agent. Although the tenancy was to commence on 1 April 1995, she had moved in on 31 March 1995 without prior notice. She also failed to pay the month`s rent in advance and a deposit. The appellant was thus displeased with her from the start. Further, she came back really late on some nights, failed to clean the hall, the utensils that she used, and littered the flat with strands of long hair. He complained to DW2, and on 19 April 1995, DW2 informed him that she had asked PW2 to move out by the end of April. On the night of 19 April 1995, PW2 approached him and asked him for a refund of $100. He refused. However, the next day, he left $50 with an accompanying note for PW2. When he returned to the flat that evening, the money was gone. PW2 did not return to the flat from 20 to 24 April 1995. The alleged outrage of modesty had taken place on 22 April 1995. She only returned to pack her belongings on 25 and 28 April 1995.
 18.The appellant denied that there had been a hole in the bathroom door at the time of the alleged offence. On 24 May 1995, he had examined the door and had even splashed water on the door to look for the hole, but had failed to find a hole. The hole in the door was the result of a fabrication of evidence perpetrated by PW1 on 16 February 1996. On that day, PW1 had told the appellant that he had brought PW2 along to his flat to verify something. He told the appellant to sit in the master bedroom and face the wall. The appellant had done so because he was frightened. He heard a `knocking sound of metal` coming from the kitchen. He wanted to go out and investigate but did not as PW1 had instructed him not to leave the room. PW1 then took him to the kitchen and pointed to a freshly made hole in the bathroom door. The appellant was very angry and strongly protested. PW1 was now slightly nervous and assured the appellant that he would get the offence compounded. The appellant had seen neither PW2 nor PW7 throughout the incident. The appellant consulted his solicitor and filed a complaint against PW1 in March 1996.
 19.The appellant also denied that the lock on PW2`s door had been in working order when she moved in. The lock had been damaged a long time ago. Since 1992, he had fixed two brackets above the damaged lock so that the door could be secured from the inside simply by passing a bar across the brackets.
 DW2
 20.DW2 was the housing agent who had introduced PW2 to the appellant. She confirmed that the appellant had complained to her about PW2, that he had asked her to tell PW2 to leave and that she had done so. However, she could not remember the dates on which these conversations had taken place.
 21.
 Decision below
The trial judge disbelieved the appellant`s allegation that PW1 had fabricated evidence against him. The trial judge found that the appellant had painted over the hole to conceal it and had concocted the allegation against PW1 to explain the presence of the hole after its discovery. The trial judge found that PW2`s evidence was corroborated not only by her police reports and the testimonies of the other prosecution witnesses but was also amply corroborated by the appellant`s lies. The trial judge also found that there were material discrepancies between the appellant`s testimony in court and his statements to the police. In the result, the trial judge accepted that PW2 was a witness of truth and rejected the appellant`s version of events.
 22.
 The appeal
The appellant raised several grounds of appeal. In relation to the charge of intrusion of privacy, the appellant contended that: (a). PW2`s evidence had not established the actus reus of the alleged offence;
 (b). the trial judge had erred in finding that PW2`s evidence had been corroborated;
 (c). the trial judge had failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that PW2 had left out material details in her police report; and
 (d). the trial judge had failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that PW2 had not confronted the appellant about the incident and had continued to stay at his flat.
 In relation to the charge of outrage of modesty, the appellant contended that the trial judge had failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that PW2 had only made a police report five days after the alleged offence had taken place.
 23.
 Whether PW2`s evidence established the actus reus of the offence of intrusion of privacy
The appellant contended that PW2`s evidence had not established that an act of peeping had taken place. All that her evidence established was that her towel had been pulled away to expose a hole in the bathroom door and that someone had been outside the bathroom. There was no allusion to the act of peeping. The appellant relied on the following extracts from the cross-examination of PW2 in support of his contention: 
Q: From where you were in the bathroom, were you able to peep through to see who was outside? 
A: No. 
Q: Did you try? 
A: Yes I did. 
Q: At that point when you suspected somebody was peeping at you did you try to see who was outside? 
A: Not at that instant. 
 
Q: Why didn`t you look through the hole to confirm whether the accused was peeping at you? 
A: My first reaction was to use the towel to cover back the hole. 
Q: You only suspected that the accused peeped at you when you were bathing? 
A: 
 I am very sure that he was the one because there was nobody in the house except him 
. 
Q: You were not in a position to say that he was using the hole to peep at you while you were bathing? 
A: 
 I`m very sure that he`s the one 
. [Emphasis is mine.]
 24.I was unable to accept the appellant`s contention. Firstly, PW2`s evidence in chief did disclose an act of peeping. She clearly stated that 
Sometime in April 1995 on that day when I was bathing, I noticed that the accused was peeping at me through a hole in the door of the bathroom which is somewhere at eye level.
 Secondly, I failed to see the relevance of the extracts from the cross-examination relied on by the appellant. The cross-examination was clearly directed at the identity of the peeping tom and not at whether the act of peeping had actually taken place. The answers which I have highlighted above clearly illustrate this point. Finally, the facts which were indisputably disclosed in her evidence in chief, including, inter alia, the fact that her towel was repeatedly pulled to one side to expose the hole in the bathroom door while she was taking a shower, by themselves lead to the inescapable inference that somebody was trying to peep through the hole at her.
 25.
 Whether there was corroboration of PW2`s evidence
The trial judge found that PW2`s evidence was corroborated not only by her police reports and the testimonies of the other prosecution witnesses but was also amply corroborated by the appellant`s lies. The appellant contended however that the trial judge had erred in treating PW2`s police reports and her previous complaints to PW3, PW4 and PW6 as corroboration. Under s 159 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed), previous consistent statements are clearly admissible as corroborative evidence. The trial judge cannot therefore be faulted for admitting the police reports and PW2`s previous complaints as corroborative evidence. Despite the admissibility of the police reports and PW2`s complaints under the label `corroboration`, however, such evidence is not independent of the complainant and adds little to the prosecution case: 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
 .
 26.The trial judge in the instant case rightly attached much greater weight to the corroboration afforded by the appellant`s lies. The trial judge found that the appellant had lied when he testified that the hole in the bathroom door had been freshly made by PW1 on 16 February 1996 and that no hole had existed prior to that date. She accepted the evidence of PW1 and PW7 that they had found a hole which had been freshly painted over and merely used a pen to poke through the layer of paint to make the hole visible. She concluded that the appellant had painted over the hole to conceal it and had concocted the allegation against PW1 so as to explain its presence after its discovery. The trial judge`s finding of fact was not challenged on appeal. There are four criteria to satisfy before a lie can amount to corroboration: 
Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 767
 . The lie must first of all be deliberate. Telling an untruth inadvertantly cannot be indicative of guilt. Secondly it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly the motive for the lie must be a realization of guilt and a fear of truth. Fourthly the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by independent evidence. In other words, the untruthfulness of the statement must be established otherwise than through the evidence of the witness whose evidence is to be corroborated. All four criteria were satisfied in the instant case. There was no question that the lies were deliberate. The truth of the matter was clearly known to the appellant. Yet he falsely maintained that the hole in the bathroom door had been freshly made by PW1 on 16 February 1996 and that no hole had existed prior to that date. The lies did relate to a material issue. Indeed, the appellant`s whole defence was that there was no hole in the bathroom door at the time of the alleged offence. The lies clearly sprang from a consciousness that the truth was inconsistent with his defence and would implicate him in the offence with which he was charged. In short, the lies were motivated by a fear of the truth. Finally, the appellant`s evidence was shown to be untrue by the independent evidence of PW1 and PW7. I therefore agreed with the trial judge that the appellant`s lies corroborated PW2`s evidence in respect of the charge of intrusion of privacy. Before I part with this issue, I should add that an attempt to subvert the course of justice by itself can amount to corroboration. The very fact that the appellant had painted over the hole to conceal it would therefore have been capable of corroborating PW2`s evidence.
 27.
 Material omissions in the police report
The appellant contended that the trial judge had failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that PW2 had left out material details in her police report. In particular, she had failed to mention that she had been taking a shower at the time of the offence, that she had seen a shadow moving outside the bathroom and that she had emerged to find that the appellant was the only one in the flat. These points were put to PW2 in cross-examination. She explained that she had provided the details of the alleged offence in her s 121 statements recorded after the making of the report. The trial judge accepted her explanation and refused to draw an adverse inference as to her credibility. I agreed entirely with the trial judge. It is a misconception to regard the first information report or police report as a document which should contain the entire case for the prosecution. Its main purpose is merely to give information of a cognizable offence to the police so as to set them in motion. The form of the police report merely requires an informant to provide `brief details including date, time and place at which the offence occurred`. The form itself clearly does not contemplate that the informant or complainant should give elaborate details of the alleged offence. The fact that such details are not mentioned in the report is therefore irrelevant. If, however, there are material discrepancies between the report and the informant`s or complainant`s testimony in court, the report will then be relevant to impeach the credibility of the witness as a previous inconsistent statement.
 28.
 PW2`s failure to confront the appellant and move out of the appellant`s flat
The appellant highlighted the fact that PW2 had not confronted the appellant over the peeping incident and had continued to stay at the flat after the alleged offence had taken place. These points were put to PW2 in cross-examination. PW2 said that she had not confronted the appellant because she had been afraid to do so. She also explained that she had continued staying at the flat because she had no place to go, and, after all, she had paid the rent and had a right to return. The trial judge accepted her explanations. In my judgment, the trial judge was perfectly justified in doing so. PW2`s explanations are not unreasonable. It is quite understandable that she should not want to confront the appellant about the incident. As for her continuing to stay at the flat, it was not in dispute that she was short of money and needed a cheap place to stay. The offence was also not of such a nature and gravity as to call for her to move out immediately. It is again quite understandable that she should have chosen to stay until the end of the month while she sought alternative and equally affordable accommodation.
 29.
 The five-day delay in making a police report
The appellant next contended that the trial judge should have drawn an adverse inference against PW2 for failing to make a prompt police report in respect of the alleged outrage of modesty. In this regard, the appellant sought to rely on the following passage from my decision in 
 Tang Kin Seng v PP 
: 
The evidential value of a prompt complaint often lay not in the fact that making it renders the victim`s testimony more credible. The evidential value of a previous complaint is that the failure to make one renders the victim`s evidence less credible. The reason is simply common human experience. It is not usual human behaviour for a victim not to make a quick complaint. However, as in all cases where common human experience is used as a yardstick, there may be very good reasons why the victim`s actions depart from it. It would then be an error not to have regard to the explanation proferred. All these merely illustrate the fallacy of adhering to a fixed formula.
 I found this contention to be totally misconceived. The test in each case is the yardstick of common human experience. While it is not usual human behaviour for a victim not to make a quick complaint to her family or friends, the same cannot be said of a failure to make a prompt police report. In my experience, there is a natural reluctance on the part of victims of sexual offences to make a police report. This stems from a variety of reasons. The victim may keep silent for fear of being stigmatised or disbelieved. She may view the police investigation and the court process, both of which are potentially intrusive and distressing, with trepidation, or she may have been so traumatised by the experience that reporting the offence is simply a very low priority. She may even have been threatened with retaliation if she reported the offence. Her first recourse will invariably be her family and friends rather than the police. Indeed, many of those who do eventually make a police report do so only after they have been persuaded to do so by their family or friends. The significance which the appellant sought to attach to PW2`s failure to make a prompt police report was therefore quite unjustified.
 30.In any event, PW2 had a perfectly reasonable explanation for the five-day delay. After she had lodged a police report in respect of the peeping incident on 21 April 1995, the police had asked her to return on 27 April 1995 to make a statement. The outrage of modesty occurred on 22 April 1995. She then decided, quite reasonably, to wait until 27 April 1995 so that she could make a direct complant to the investigating officer recording her statement. For the foregoing reasons, I agreed with the trial judge that the five-day delay should not tell against PW2`s credit.
 31.
 Other observations
The appellant spent considerable time here and below trying to establish that he had been unhappy with PW2 and that he had eventually instructed DW2 to get PW2 to leave. This was confirmed by DW2. Nonetheless, while this evidence went towards establishing an alternative explanation for PW2`s abrupt departure from the appellant`s flat which was consistent with the appellant`s innocence, it was by no means conclusive of his innocence, and did not by itself serve to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution`s case.
 32.I agreed with the trial judge`s finding that there were material discrepancies between the appellant`s testimony and his s 121 statements. Firstly, the appellant claimed in court that the alleged outrage of modesty could not have taken place as PW2 had not even returned to the flat from 20 to 24 April 1995, and that he had argued with PW2 over the rent on 19 April 1995. However, in his s 121 statements, the appellant stated that he had argued with PW2 over the rent in his flat on the evening of 23 April 1995. Secondly, PW2 had testified that the appellant had damaged the lock on her door so that he could enter her room at will. The appellant denied this and testified that the lock on PW2`s door had been damaged in 1992, long before PW2 had moved in. However, in his s 121 statements, he said that the lock in PW2`s room had only ceased to work in the second week of April.
 33.In the result, I was satisfied that the arguments presented did not raise a reasonable doubt as to the prosecution`s case. I therefore dismissed the appeals against the convictions.
 34.
 Sentences
The appellant was sentenced to one month`s imprisonment on the charge of intrusion of privacy. The maximum sentence in respect of this offence is one year`s imprisonment or a fine or both. In imposing such a sentence, the trial judge had taken into account the fact that the appellant had attempted to cover up his offence and had abused his position as a landlord. I was nonetheless of the view that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Accordingly, I reduced the sentence to a fine of $2000, in default one month`s imprisonment.
 35.I did not, however, interefere with the sentence of five months` imprisonment in respect of the charge of outrage of modesty. The appellant`s total sentence was therefore five months` imprisonment and a fine of $2000, in default a further one month`s imprisonment.",1997-11-06 00:00:00,SG High Court

Cur Adv Vult
The plaintiffs, which were statutorily incorporated sometime in October 1981 under the rubric Management Corporation of Strata Title No 549, are the registered proprietors of the land known as Lot 544 of TS 29 on which is erected a ten storey block of 40 flats, known as the Golden Tower. The flats in the condominium block are held by subsidiary proprietors under separate subsidiary certificates of strata titles.
 2.The defendants are the registered proprietors of the adjoining land comprised in Lot 545 of the same town subdivision, having purchased it in an option sale on 6 July 1989 at the price of $975,000. In March 1992 the defendants commenced demolition of the single bungalow on the land and pursuant to written planning permission granted on 19 February 1992 the defendants completed the erection of an eight storey block containing seven flats. The total gross floor area of the building was permitted to be 1545.93m2. The temporary occupation licence has been issued.
 3.
 The starting point
Until the events hereinafter referred to, the two lots mentioned above and lot 546 (on which is still erected a single bungalow) were, before their subdivision, comprised in the parent lot known as Lot 331 of TS 29. On 23 June 1980 Lot 331 was brought under the regime of the Land Titles Act and the Land Titles (Strata) Act.
 4.The relevant starting point to focus on is 24 September 1980. On that day, Lot 331 was owned entirely by a family company known as Hup Choon Kim Kee Pte Ltd (HCKK). They had earlier submitted subdivision and development plans. On that day, written permission was given by the competent authority under s 9 of the Planning Act (Cap 279, 1970 Ed) for the proposed subdivision of the land into three plots and strata subdivision of the existing ten storey block of flats into 40 separate units: see AB25-28. As will be seen from the plan, Lot 331 was L-shaped, except that the lower horizontal line points the other way. To the north-west of the land abutted and still abuts Mimbu Road, Singapore. There was then shown on the north-western boundary of Lot 331, which included Lot 545, a `reserve for road` to Mimbu Road. However, this reserve was physically within the boundaries of Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). A copy of the plan approved for subdivision by the competent authority is annexed at the end of this judgment as Annexure A.
 5.It was a planning condition that a 20ft driveway be granted by the owners on Lot 544 in favour of Lots 545 and 546. The relevant legend in the written permission stated that Lot 544 was `to contain an existing ten storey building with provisions for car park, driveway and water pump house. Rights of way over the 20ft driveway (coloured brown) to be extended to Plots (2) and (3)`. Plot (2) eventually turned out upon resurvey to be Lot 545 and plot (3) became Lot 546.
 6.
 Background
I should now revert to the ownership and configuration of the land, from which Lot 331 of TS 29 was derived. This necessarily takes us back to 1960. One Low Yok Kay and Low Geok Koon owned the piece of land known as Lot 32 of TS 29, Akyab Road, Singapore. On its western end was Lot 57 of the same town subdivision.
 7.On 2 January 1960 the Singapore Improvement Trust granted written permission for the development of two pairs of semi-detached houses and two bungalows. One plot of land at the extreme west end of Lot 32 (now known as Lot 330 TS 29) was set aside for road widening.
 8.On 9 July 1963 written permission was granted under the Planning Act for the development of the other part of Lot 32 TS 29; the `Golden Tower` building, a four storey building and a 36ft wide street on Lot 32 TS 29 were depicted on the approved plan. The street was meant to give access to the two bungalows. All the houses and the Golden Tower building were completed by 1973.
 9.On 24 September 1964 Low Yok Kay and Low Geok Koon, who were brothers, transferred Lot 32 TS 29 to their family company, HCKK.
 10.A resurvey of Lot 32 TS 29 was carried out and the chief surveyor by certified plan No 14274 dated 14 October 1967 allotted new lot numbers to the subdivided lots, amongst which were Lots 330 and 331 of TS 29. Mimbu Road was constructed in 1967.
 11.On 19 February 1973 the proposed 36ft wide street was replaced by a concrete driveway of 20ft wide (the said driveway) pursuant to the approval of the competent authority. The approval, however, was on a temporary basis until such time as redevelopment of the land containing the two bungalows or subdivision of Lot 331 TS 29 was envisaged. When this approval was granted, the two bungalows and Golden Tower were completed.
 12.On 23 June 1980 Lot 331 TS 29 was brought under the Land Titles Act and the certificate of title was issued. HCKK were the owners of the land on which were erected a ten storey block of 40 flats (Golden Tower) and two bungalows.
 13.As has been elaborately noted in para 4 herein, on 24 September 1980 the competent authority approved the subdivision of Lot 331 TS 29 into three lots, namely Lot 544 on which stands Golden Tower and Lots 545 and 546 on each of which was erected a single storey bungalow. The subdivision was made subject to a right of way, as depicted on the approved plan, over the said driveway on Lot 544 for the benefit of Lots 545 and 546 of TS 29.
 14.By a deed of grant dated 16 January 1981 made between Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd, the mortgagee bank of the one part, HCKK, the `servient` owner as owner of Plot 1 (now known as Lot 544 of TS 29) together with the building erected thereon comprising 40 units of apartments and known as 29-35 Mimbu Road, Singapore, of the second part and HCKK, the `dominant` owner as owner of Plot 2 (now known as Lot 545 of TS 29) together with the house erected thereof and known as No 41 Mimbu Road, Singapore and as owner of Plot 3 (now known as Lot 546 of TS 29) together with the house erected thereon of the third part, the mortgagee bank granted the right of way between points A and B on the plan annexed to the said deed of grant and coloured brown, which eventually became the said driveway.
 15.On 13 October 1983 separate certificates of title were issued to HCKK for Lots 544 with subsidiary strata titles for the 40 flats and separate titles were issued for Lots 545 and 546.
 16.On 17 October 1983 HCKK was voluntarily wound-up and the liquidators were empowered to distribute the properties in specie to members of the company. Lot 545 was transferred to Low Yok Koon who, as stated earlier, sold it to the defendants.
 17.In July 1989 the defendants submitted drawings to the competent authority for planning permission to erect an eight storey block containing ten flats on Lot 545. Their architects stated that there was an 8m (around 26ft) common access over the said driveway. There was no mention of the car parks marked out along the said driveway. The plaintiffs alleged that this was an omission which in the circumstances amounted to a misrepresentation to the competent authority.
 18.On 1 November 1989 the defendants obtained provisional planning permission from the competent authority for the development of the block comprising ten flats, subject to the resolution of the alignment of the common access over Lot 544; that is, subject to the demarcation of the said driveway.
 19.On 22 March 1990 the defendants issued OS No 316/90 against the plaintiffs claiming for a declaration of a right of way over the said driveway. The defendants initiated proceedings because the plaintiffs had disputed the claim.
 20.On 28 June 1990, in response to the defendants` request for a waiver of the planning conditions, required of the defendants to obtain `a letter from the Management Corporation`s (ie the plaintiffs`) solicitors confirming that the subject site (could) take access from Mimbu Road through Lot 544 freely at all times.`
 21.In an affidavit filed on behalf of the plaintiffs, it was affirmed that the plaintiffs had never prevented the owners of Lots 545 and 546 from passing over the said driveway (of 20ft width). However, the plaintiffs disputed the defendants had a right of way over the said driveway.
 22.On 19 September 1990 the competent authority waived their requirement that the defendants obtain the alignment and confirmation of the right of way over the said driveway.
 23.By a letter dated 10 October 1990 the defendants` solicitors informed an employee of the defendants` architects of the outcome of a meeting with officers of the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) as the competent authority. It was reported that the competent authority wanted confirmation that there was no access to the defendants` lot except from the said driveway and that it was `impossible to construct a road behind the subject plot which has been presently reserved for road in the Road Interpretation Plan.` The `subject plot` referred to the road reserve within the compound of TTSH.
 24.On 4 October 1990 the defendants` architects wrote to the Chief Transportation Engineer, Roads and Transportation Division, to enquire if there were plans to connect Mimbu Road to the road reserve within the compound of TTSH and to advise on the status of the road reserve. The reply was that there was no proposal to link Mimbu Road to the road reserve. That decision effectively meant that the said driveway was the only access for the defendants.
 25.On 9 November 1990 the defendants` architects sought further clarification regarding the status of the road reserve and was told that the road reserve was an internal road owned by TTSH and access to the road had to be cleared with the hospital authorities. There were no prospects of the defendants getting access via the road reserve within the compound of TTSH.
 26.The defendants` architects on 22 November 1990 wrote to the Chief Planner, URA, and informed him that alternative access from the road reserve was not possible. They also requested the URA to acquire the 20ft common access private driveway on Lot 544 (ie the said driveway). The URA replied that it had no power to acquire the said driveway.
 27.On 6 May 1991, the URA issued written permission to the defendants for the erection of an eight storey apartment block with ten flats. On 19 February 1992 written permission was granted for the eight storey apartment block to contain seven flats. They knew or must have known the width of the said driveway as 20ft.
 28.In March 1992, the defendants demolished the bungalow on Lot 545 and began construction. During the defendants` construction of their block of flats on Lot 545, there were movements of heavy construction vehicles and the usual inconvenience. The plaintiffs alleged that there was damage to the surface and structure of the said driveway, a barrier installed at the said driveway and that the defendants had interfered with the use and enjoyment of the said driveway by the plaintiffs and the subsidiary proprietors. During the period of construction, heavy vehicles were parked on the said driveway and on other parts of the common property belonging to the plaintiffs.
 29.On 10 March 1992 and 8 May 1992 the plaintiffs` solicitors complained that the heavy construction vehicles had brought mud and soil onto their common property. By mid-May 1992 the mud and silt had been cleared by the defendants` piling contractor. The plaintiffs also alleged trespass and claimed damages.
 30.The plaintiffs complained to the competent authority that the defendants had distorted the extent of the right of way over the said driveway. What was a 20ft driveway had become an 8m (26ft) wide access, which the defendants` architects had stated in their submission plans. On the other hand, the defendants protested to the competent authority that the plaintiffs or their predecessors-in-title were in breach of the planning condition under which the plaintiffs were clearly required to set aside the said driveway for access by the owners of Lots 545 and 546 of TS 29.
 31.Before I recite the proceedings instituted by both parties, I should mention one crucial fact in the nature of a statutory intervention which could entail legal consequences for the parties. By the Land Titles (Amendment Act) 1993 (No 27 of 1993) passed by Parliament on 30 August 1993 and assented to by the President on 27 September 1993, the Land Titles Act (Cap 157) was amended by the introduction, inter alia, of s 99. By that section, and in the events therein happening, `there shall be implied in respect of each lot of the estate (as defined) in favour and as appurtenant thereto, all such easements of way (inter alia) on the lands appropriated or set apart for those purposes on the approved subdivision plan relating to the estate `.
 32.The 
 Report of the Select Committee 
 on the Land Titles Bill [Bill No 36/92], 18 August 1993, reported in paras 23 to 25 as follows, points to the importance and function of the approved subdivision plan: 
23 Clause 99 seeks to imply certain easements in respect of parts of an estate where the approved subdivision plan for the estate contains a legend indicating those easements and the dominant and servient tenements. Examples of such easements are a right of way, a right to make connections to electrical sub-stations and party wall rights. By this approach, there is no need to describe the easements in cl 99 as they would be described in the legend. 
24 A representor expressed some concern over the lack of description of the type of easements that are to be implied under cl 99 as well as the lack of description of the servient lots. Another representor suggested that the easements to be implied should be set out within cl 99 instead of being set out in a legend endorsed on the approved plan for subdivision. They recommended an approach similar to that in the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158). As the majority of easements are in respect of roads, electrical substations, septic tanks, drainage reserves and party walls, the approval of any lot as a road, electrical subdivision, etc in an approved subdivision plan should imply the easements for corresponding rights of use. Similarly, the approval of any terrace or semi-detached house should imply the right of support for party walls. 
25 The Committee sees some merit in the latter approach. It is, however, not feasible to imply a common set of easements for all developments. The Committee therefore recommends that cl 99 describe the common easements and these will be implied where indicated in the approved subdivision plans.
 33.I should now reproduce s 99 of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 1994 Ed) in its entirety, which sets out the statutory regime for the creation by statutory implication of easements for right of way and other rights shown in an approved subdivision plan: 
(1) Where the competent authority has approved the development and subdivision of any land comprised in an estate before or after 1st March 1994, there shall be implied in respect of each lot of the estate which is used or intended to be used as a separate tenement (referred to hereinafter as the lot) in favour of the registered proprietor of the lot and as appurtenant thereto, all such easements of way and drainage and for party wall purposes and for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sewerage and telephone and other services to the lot on, over or under the lands appropriated or set apart for those purposes respectively on the approved subdivision plan relating to the estate as may be necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the lot and of any building or part of a building at any time thereon. 
(2) All ancillary rights and obligations reasonably necessary to make the easements referred to in sub-section (1) effective shall be implied. 
(3) In respect of all the easements implied by this section, there shall also be implied a covenant binding all registered proprietors enjoying the benefit of such easements to contribute to the cost of maintenance or repair of the subject of the easements as if the easements and the covenant to contribute had been created by an instrument registered under this Act and so long as such easements subsist the covenant to contribute shall bind any successor in title enjoying the benefit of the easements except that in the case of the right to erect and maintain party walls, the implied covenant provided in this subsection shall bind only the registered proprietors of the lots on which party walls have been erected. 
(4) Subsection (3) shall not render any person liable to contribute to expenditure incurred at a time before he became, or after he ceased to be, a proprietor of the lot to which the liability attached. 
(5) The easements implied by this section shall be enforceable without any memorial or notification on the folios, and accordingly section 97(5) and (6) shall not apply thereto. 
(6) Unity of seisin of two or more lots shall not destroy the easements implied by this section but on the cessation of such unity they shall continue in full force and effect as if the seisin had never been united. 
(7) The easements implied by this section shall not apply to the lots in an estate where subdivision approval was given by the competent authority prior to 1st March 1994 and satisfactory documentary evidence has been produced to the Registrar of the completion of the transfer of any lot in the estate to a purchaser with easements expressly created in an instrument which has been executed and delivered to the purchaser. 
(8) In this section -
 
`competent authority` means the competent authority appointed under section 3 of the Planning Act; 
`estate` means land which has been subdivided into lots under the Planning Act where those lots include land intended for use as easements to be made appurtenant to other lots within the same estate as shown in the subdivision plan approved by the competent authority, a copy of which is deposited with the Registrar; and may include undeveloped lots in the course of erection which are shown in the first subdivision plan approved by the competent authority and is capable of being subdivided as shown in one or more approved subsequent subdivision plans as and when issued by the competent authority and copies of the subdivision plans have been delivered to the Registrar; 
`lot` means a parcel of land forming part of an estate to which the Chief Surveyor has allotted a Government survey lot number and also described as a `lot` in a subdivision plan approved by the competent authority under the Planning Act.
 34.As is well-known the central feature of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 1994 Ed) (the Act) is that it ensures the paramountcy or indefeasibility of the title of any proprietor of registered land subject to a few exceptions. The possibly relevant exceptions for our purposes is set out in s 46(1)(b) of the Act which provides as follows: 
(1) Notwithstanding the existence in any other person of any estate or interest, whether derived by grant from the State or otherwise, which but for this Act might be held to be paramount or to have priority, and notwithstanding any failure to observe the procedural requirements of this Act, any person who becomes the proprietor of registered land, whether or not he dealt with a proprietor, and notwithstanding any lack of good faith on the part of the person through whom he claims, shall hold that land free from all encumbrances, liens, estates and interests whatsoever except such as may be registered or notified in the land-register, but subject to - 
 
 
(b) any subsisting easement or public right of way which was in existence at the date on which the land was brought under the provisions of this Act and any right on, above or under any land created before or after 1st March 1994 in favour of a public authority under any statute and any statutory easement implied under sections 98, 99, 101, 102 and 104; 
 
 35.
 The proceedings filed
I will now briefly recite the proceedings filed in the High Court. On 22 March 1990 the defendants issued OS No 316/90 against the plaintiffs claiming a right of way over the said driveway of 20ft width `for all purposes connected with the use and enjoyment as a private residence until separate physical access from the said Minibu Road is available`. The defendants prayed for an order that the plaintiffs do execute the Grant of Easement in the Land Titles form granting the said right of way.
 36.On 13 November 1992 the plaintiffs instituted Suit No 2385/92 against the defendants claiming - (i). a declaration that the right of way over the said 20ft driveway purportedly created by the said Deed of Grant as pertinent to the defendants` property was not effectively created and the said right of way had never, at any time, been created;
 (ii). alternatively, a declaration that any right of way so granted was exercisable only for and in connection with the use of the defendants` property as a single-storey private residence;
 (iii). a declaration that the alleged right of way has been extinguished;
 (iv). an injunction restraining the defendants from using the said driveway; and
 (v). damages for trespass.
 37.By an order of court dated 24 October 1995 Suit No 2385/92 and OS No 316/90 were consolidated.
 38.In November 1996 the defendants were allowed to amend their defence and the originating summons. By those amendments, the defendants made the following assertions: (i). there was an easement of way implied by s 99(1) of the Act;
 (ii). alternatively, there was a quasi-easement of way implied under the common law on 23 June 1980 when the parent Lot 331 of TS 29 was brought under the Act;
 (iii). there was no extinguishment of such easement implied under s 99 of the Act and/or the common law by the development of the eight storey building containing seven flats on the defendants` land; and
 (iv). the plaintiffs are not entitled to an injunction.
 39.By the amended originating summons the defendants are seeking the following reliefs against the plaintiffs: (i). a declaration that the defendants and their successors-in-title, the owners and occupiers of the defendants property are entitled to an easement of way over the said driveway (20ft wide) as depicted in the plan annexed to the originating summons;
 (ii). (a) an order that the plaintiffs lodge with the Registry of Land Titles the requisite form entitled `Deposit of Approved Subdivision Plan for Creation of Implied Easement` under s 99 of the Act;
 . (b) alternatively, an order that the plaintiffs execute the annexed Grant of Easement in the Land Titles form granting the said easement of way;
 . And in default of the plaintiffs lodging the above form as ordered by the court within 14 days thereof, the Registrar of the Supreme Court be empowered to execute and the defendants be authorised to lodge the said form.
 40.
 The issues
I now turn to the first question in dispute between the parties, namely, whether the easement right of way was implied under s 99 of the Act on the said driveway in favour of the defendants` property and as appurtenant thereto. On a purposive interpretation of s 99 of the Act and applying the facts narrated above, I am of the view that the right of way was created by statutory implication under s 99 of the Act. The competent authority has approved the development and subdivision of the parent Lot 331 of TS 29 which, in my view, plainly falls within the definition of the concept of `estate` as defined in s 99(8) of the Act. The statutory implication of a group of easements, including rights of way, from the time of the written approval of the competent authority and as depicted in the subdivision plan obviously promote certainty and definition of the rights involved and s 99(1) is directed principally at giving effect to the subdivision approval granted by the competent authority granted under what is now s 10(3) of the Planning Act (Cap 232).
 41.In my view, it does not matter that the `development` of part of Lot 331 TS 29 had been approved by the competent authority earlier than the `subdivision` approval given on 24 September 1980. Learned counsel for the plaintiffs is, with respect, perfectly right in his submission that it has to be shown that the competent authority has approved the development and subdivision and that those words import different processes which entail quite different consequences to a piece of registered land. Development involves the building, engineering, mining or material changes in the use of any building or land as defined in s 12(1) of the Planning Act (Cap 232). Subdivision, on the other hand, concerns the division of a piece of land into small lots, resurvey of the same and the allocation of new resurvey lot numbers by the chief surveyor. Since 1 February 1960 in Singapore no person may develop or subdivide any land without the written permission of the competent authority. Previously, the matter was regulated by the Singapore Improvement Trust Ordinance.
 42.There can be development carried out on a parent lot, or in an estate under common ownership, pursuant to written permission granted by the competent authority followed by written planning permission for the subdivision of the parent lot. The competent authority, presently the Chief of the URA and the Director-General of Public Works (see Suit No 356/89), has overall control. The two processes taking place at different times do not in any way prevent him from exercising his authority in accordance with the relevant planning considerations and rules made under the Planning Act.
 43.It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that the second reason why s 99(1) is not applicable is because the approved subdivision plan of 24 September 1980 was never lodged with the Registrar of Titles. It is true that HCKK did not lodge the approved plan because s 99 was only enacted in 1993. To my mind, this was a procedural omission, which was unavoidable seeing that s 99 was enacted in 1993. So far as it concerns the plaintiffs, there has been in substance no injustice. They have always allowed the use of the driveway as a right of way so long as the user was limited to a single private residence. Matters took a turn for the worse when the defendants erected a building containing seven flats, which would involve more vehicular and pedestrian traffic linked with owners or occupiers of the seven flats.
 44.Learned counsel for the plaintiffs further submitted that the third reason why s 99(1) is inapplicable is because it does not abrogate the common law rule that an easement can only be created when land is not in common ownership. He refers to s 99(6) but makes the point that this subsection does not 
 create 
 easements in common ownership, but only 
 preserves 
 easements already 
 created 
. It seems to me, with respect, that the answer is that s 99(1) creates the easement by statutory implication from the moment the competent authority has granted approvals for development and subdivision without any reference to the common or divided ownership of the dominant and servient tenement. The underlying idea of an `estate` as defined in s 99, and the reference to `each lot of the estate which is used or 
 intended 
 to be used as a separate tenement` in sub-s (1), both suggest that the easements shall be implied and created from the date of the written permission for subdivision and development. In other words, s 99 was enacted in the knowledge that more often than not the estate is under common ownership. The common law rule, in my view, was overridden by statute. In my view, sub-s 99(6) addresses the doubt that may arise about the destruction of any implied easements upon unity of seisin of the relevant number of lots by introducing the fiction that the seisin had never been united. That in my view was the limited purpose of the subsection.
 45.I turn briefly to the related issue whether there was any express or implied easement existing at the date the land was brought under the Land Titles Act. The parent lot was brought under the Land Titles Act from 23 June 1980. In August of the following year, as stated earlier, HCKK as owner of the servient tenement and HCKK as owner of the dominant tenement executed the Deed of Grant of easement. This was incontrovertibly an invalid grant because one `cannot have an easement over your own land`: 
Seah Sye Kim v Chua Mui Ying
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 1
  
[1988] SLR 278
 . It was not until 25 November 1985 that the relevant properties began to move out of common ownership. The only way an easement can be created under the Land Titles Act is by way of registration of an instrument in the prescribed form and by endorsing a memorial on the folio of the register of the servient tenement and a notification on the folio of the dominant tenement: see s 97(l), (5) and (6) of the Act and 
Lim Hong Seng v East Coast Medicare Centre Pte Ltd
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 685
  at p 697. As the provisions of the Land Titles Act were not complied with, there was no easement by express grant and registration.
 46.The next issue is whether the quasi-easement implied under the common law (if any) was preserved under s 46(1)(b) despite the lack of registration and notification when the parent Lot 331 of TS 29 was brought under the Land Titles Act. I have recited s 46(1)(b). It has to be considered since s 97(1) of the Act, as noted earlier, stipulates that `(a)n easement shall not be acquired over registered land by user nor by any implication of law except as may be provided in this Act; ` Learned counsel for the defendants submitted that `any subsisting easement` within the meaning of s 46(1)(b) included a quasi-easement or an equitable easement arising out of the rule in 
Wheeldon v Burrows
 
[1879] 12 Ch D 31
; ie that it is a recognised exception to the indefeasibility of title and therefore it matters not that such easements were not reflected in the registers of the servient and dominant owners. He relies on the majority decision of the High Court of Australia in 
Dabbs v Seaman
 
[1925] 
36 CLR 538
 and 
 Lim Hong Seng 
 [supra]. In 
 Lim Hong Seng 
`s case Judith Prakash J held that an easement acquired by long user prior to the bringing of the land involved under the Land Titles Act was within the ambit of s 46(1)(b) of the Act. In 
 Dabbs 
` case, the High Court of Australia invoked the doctrine of estoppel against Seaman to contradict or impugn the conventional state of facts where Dabbs had a right of access to the highway.
 47.The defendants also relied on a commentary on similar legislation in New South Wales, Australia; though it must be emphasised that the wording is different. In Woodman & Nettle, 
 The Torrens System in NSW 
 (2 Ed) pp 10242 and 10244 state: 
Under s 42(1)(a1), the registered proprietor holds subject to the certain easements that do not appear in the Register. Specifically, the estate or interest of a registered proprietor is subject to the `omission` or `misdescription` of an easement, in two circumstances: first, where the easement was `subsisting immediately before the land was brought under the Real Property Act;` and `are easements arising by implication (such as under the principle in 
Wheeldon v Burrows
 
[1879] 12 Ch D 31
) and not recorded in the folio of the Register, ""omitted"" for the purposes of s 42(1)(a1)?` To begin with the first of the two limbs distinguished earlier assume that an implied easement arose when the land was under old system title and was left off the folio of the Register for the servient land in the conversion to Torrens title. Clearly, the easement could be said to have `subsisted` immediately before the land was brought under the Real Property Act. Therefore, it is `omitted` and so is enforceable against later proprietors of the servient land.
 48.1.In this case, the development plan approved in 1973 depicted the said driveway. This was repeated in the 1980 subdivision plan. There was express mention of the right of way. The plans to the certificates of titles to all three lots derived from Lot 331 of TS 29 all depicted the said driveway. In fact, the driveway was used and allowed to be used as a right of way for Lots 545 and 546 of TS 29. This was a paradigm case for the operation of the rule in 
 Wheeldon v Burrows 
. When HCKK transferred Lots 545 and 546 of TS 29 and the two bungalows erected thereon, the transfer included the grant by implication of a right of way over the driveway. HCKK and their successors in title are not permitted to derogate from the grant by implication and this is made possible, in my view, by the terms of s 46(1)(b) of the Act.
 48.2.The plaintiffs further submitted that there was another access via the road reserve in the grounds of TTSH. The authorities in charge of road making have not decided on making up and linking the road reserve to Mimbu Road. Secondly, the owners of the road reserve, ie the servient owner, was not a party to the proceedings and I do not think the matter should be decided in the absence of the servient tenement. There was also some doubt on the evidence whether the defendants have any direct access to the road reserve as there could have been an intervening parcel of land. Accordingly, the plaintiffs have failed to show that there was another access available to the defendants to Mimbu Road.
 49.Another issue raised by the plaintiffs is their contention that if there is an implied easement, either at common law or under s 99(1) of the Act, it should be restricted to the user specified in the approval plan for subdivision and development.
 50.1.I will limit my views to the question whether an easement implied under s 99(1) of the Act should be restricted to the user specified for subdivision and development. I do not think so. The reasons are as follows. First, the statutory scheme for the implication of the group of easements is put in place on the premise that development within each dominant tenement is subject to the permission of the competent authority. There are planning conditions governing usage, density, ambience and, not least, there are rules for the provisions of car parks and adequate access. There is therefore no reason to restrict the easements to the user described in any development plan. Such descriptions, if any, as in this case, are meant to be descriptive rather than prescriptive. The way the competent authority is expected to control and restrict the usage of any easement is through the exercise of his power to grant written permission for development. He should be expected not to grant permission for a development which would intolerably overload the usage of any right of way; but it is a matter entirely for the competent authority. Secondly, there is no reason to freeze the use of a piece of dominant tenement to that enjoyed at the time of the written approval for the development and subdivision. On the contrary, much may be said in favour of leaving the matter to be decided by the competent authority and, wherever possible, to allow the maximum use of land.
 50.2.In this context, I would briefly deal with the strenuous submissions of the plaintiffs that the defendants should not be given any assistance by this court granting the declaration they are seeking because the defendants and their architects had misrepresented to the competent authority the width of the said driveway. The competent authority knew of the width and it proceeded to grant the written permission to the defendants. The defendants rely on their right of way which is implied under s 99(1) of the Act or arises under the rule in 
 Wheeldon v Burrows 
. Their application to the competent authority to develop their property is a matter between them and the competent authority who, in any case, approved the development knowing that the width of the said driveway is 20ft.
 51.I turn lastly to the claim of trespass against the defendants. The defendants are indeed liable for allowing the construction vehicles to be parked on the driveway and on the other parts of the plaintiffs` common property. They also caused inconvenience and damage to the barrier. As agreed, the amount of damages, which I should think are not very much, is ordered to be assessed by the Registrar. Under s 99(2), the defendants enjoy the `ancillary rights to make the easements referred to in sub-section (1) effective.` Included is the right for even construction vehicles to pass and repass, though not to park on the said driveway.
 52.In the light of my decisions, I make the declaration that the defendants and their successor-in-title and their servants, agents and invitees are entitled to an easement of way over the 20ft driveway as depicted in Annexure A. I order the plaintiffs to lodge with the Registry of Land Titles the form as prayed for by the defendants. There will be liberty to apply to both parties. On the question of costs, the fair order to make is that the plaintiffs shall pay two-thirds of the costs to the defendants.",1997-11-19 00:00:00,SG High Court

JUDITH PRAKASH J
 
Cur Adv Vult
The plaintiff and the defendant are well-established trading companies in Singapore. In 1994, a fateful year, both decided to venture into the `instant` beverage and food business. That decision led inevitably to both of them making the most popular of such products, the 3-in-1 instant coffee. The plaintiff now claims that the defendant has, since about March 1996, passed off or attempted to pass off the defendant`s brand of 3-in-1 instant coffee mix as and for the plaintiff`s coffee mix both in Singapore and elsewhere.
 2.The defendant has defended the claim vigorously. It says that when it started to sell its product, `A MaxCoffee`, in Singapore in October 1995, the plaintiff`s `MacCoffee` had not acquired the reputation or goodwill necessary to allow the plaintiff to prosecute a passing off action. Secondly, it denies that the get-up of its product is so similar to that of the plaintiff that the defendant`s product can be confused with or passed off as the plaintiff`s.
 3.
 Factual background
This account of the facts leading up to the action is taken substantially from the affidavits of evidence-in-chief filed by Mr Tan Wang Cheow, a director of the plaintiff company, and that of Mr Eng Yew Beng who is employed as sales manager by the defendant.
 4.The plaintiff company was incorporated under the law of Singapore as a private limited company in 1982. According to the business profile obtainable from the Registry of Companies, the plaintiff is, principally, a wholesale trader (including an importer and exporter) and commission agent. In 1994, the plaintiff decided to branch out by developing a product range of 3-in-1 beverages that would appeal to consumers in emerging markets in the Asia Pacific region. Due to the small size of Singapore`s domestic market as well as the fact that it was already well-supplied with such products, the plaintiff decided that it would be more fruitful for it to focus initially on the relatively `virgin and underdeveloped` overseas markets.
 5.The initial products were to be 3-in-1 coffee mix, tea mix and chocolate mix. The plaintiff had noted that the potential export market was particularly good for 3-in-1 coffee mix. The 3-in-1 product, by then well known in Singapore, is a serving size mixture of coffee, creamer and sugar packed in an individual foil sachet. All that is needed to complete the beverage is hot water. These sachets are sold in bulk packs of 20 to 50 sachets each and, as a convenience beverage, the 3-in-1 mix has proved to be popular for both domestic and office consumption.
 6.After studying the trends in, and taste preferences of, the initial markets which it identified as those of Russia and Vietnam, the plaintiff decided that its product should bear an `American` style. The plaintiff wanted an image to convey the impression of a sophisticated, western, capitalistic `American` taste and it chose the trade mark and get-up for its product accordingly.
 7.The plaintiff`s packaging started with a trade mark beginning with the prefix `MAC`. It considered `Mac` to be a way of addressing persons whose names were not known which was commonly used in western English speaking countries. Apart from the prefix `MAC` which was to be affixed to all the different products of the plaintiff in order to give them a common identity, the packaging also carried a design showing the American flag across the top corner and a logo depicting a stylised American eagle. In addition, the `MacCoffee` mark was coloured in a gradated brown colour which the plaintiff considered reminiscent of an American `western` style. Finally, the phrase `True American Taste` was printed prominently across the bottom of the packaging. All of these separate elements were designed to convey the American image and appeal which the plaintiff wished consumers to obtain.
 8.After finalising the design, the plaintiff, on 28 December 1994, filed an application to register `MACCOFFEE & EAGLE DESIGN` in Class 30 in respect of `Instant coffee mix` at the Registry of Trade Marks. Since this trade mark was duly registered only on 10 May 1997, the plaintiff cannot, and do not, rely on it for the purpose of this action.
 9.According to Mr Tan, the plaintiff commenced marketing and selling its MAC products in August 1994. The initial sales were to Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, Vietnam, United Emirates and Pakistan. The products, especially MacCoffee, were immediately successful in these markets. In order to develop the export market for its MAC products, the plaintiff participated in various international food and beverage shows or exhibitions such as the `MOSFOOD `95` and `WORLD FOOD `95` exhibitions in Moscow and the `ANUGA `95` exhibition in Germany. The plaintiff continued its participation in foreign exhibitions in 1996, attending at least eight. It also took out space or advertised in various trade or food directories such as 
 World Food `96 
, 
 Singapore Food and Beverage Directory 
 and the 
 Singapore Exporters `96/97 Directory 
.
 10.Mr Tan asserted that by virtue of the constant and continued export of the MAC products by the plaintiff, the plaintiff had acquired a valuable and substantial goodwill in connection with each of these products in each of the markets to which it exports them, and in Singapore as well, especially in the export trade community. According to the plaintiff`s annual accounts, export sales of beverages in 1995 accounted for over $17m in gross income. Mr Tan said that approximately 90% of these sales would have been attributed to the MacCoffee brand. As for the year ended December 1996, the export sales figures rose to over $28m.
 11.To develop brand recognition and goodwill, according to Mr Tan, the plaintiff expended considerable sums in promoting and publicising its MacCoffee and MAC range of products in emerging markets in the region as well as in Singapore in 1995, 1996 and 1997. He exhibited to his affidavit, copies of invoices, advertisements and other documents relating to the advertisement and promotion of MacCoffee in Russia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Kazakhstan and Bangladesh. As of May 1997 when Mr Tan`s affidavit was filed, the plaintiff`s export market included countries from the former Soviet Union, South East Asia, the Indian sub-continent, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Europe.
 12.The plaintiff commenced local distribution of products bearing the MAC prefix trade mark in Singapore in 1995. The initial sales related to MacNoodles which were carried by the NTUC chain of supermarkets. This product was advertised on television for approximately one month. A second distribution channel was set up in November 1995, whereby Kiam Seng & Co was appointed as the exclusive distributor for Ice MacCoffee. Mr Tan said that the distribution covered a large number of coffee shops, coffee stalls, minimarts, cafes and canteens. An invoice attached to Mr Tan`s affidavit shows that 600 cartons of Ice MacCoffee, which was a liquid beverage supplied in cans, were sold to Kiam Seng & Co on 14 November 1995.
 13.In August 1996, the plaintiff appointed Triton Global Investments Pte Ltd as distributor within Singapore for MacCoffee, MacTea, MacChocolate, Mac Ice Lemon Tea and Mac Ice Can Milk Coffee. The distribution agreement was for a trial period of six months. It would be noted that the agreement included distribution rights for `Mac Ice Can Milk Coffee` although Mr Tan had earlier stated that the exclusive distributor for `Ice MacCoffee` was Kiam Seng & Co. Perhaps Kiam Seng & Co was given the rights to a slightly different product or perhaps the sale to Kiam Seng & Co was a one-off transaction rather than in a course of a distribution agreement.
 14.In April 1996, according to Mr Tan, the plaintiff received information that the defendant were selling a 3-in-1 coffee mix product under the trade mark `MaxCoffee`. He considered that the defendant`s packaging bore specific similarities to the plaintiff`s product. The plaintiff took the view that the inspiration for the trade mark and the packaging design of the defendant`s product was derived from its own MacCoffee product and, on 26 April 1996, the plaintiff`s solicitors wrote to the defendant telling the latter to recall its product from the market and to cease all further manufacture, distribution and sale of it in Singapore and in the other markets in which MacCoffee was then sold. The defendant did not comply and the plaintiff accordingly commenced this action on 27 June 1996.
 15.According to the plaintiff`s statement of claim, MacCoffee is sold in a bulk package containing 50 aluminium foil sachets of instant coffee mix for individual consumption. The package has a distinctive get-up as described in para 7 above. The plaintiff went on to allege that it had acquired significant and valuable goodwill in the name `MacCoffee` and the get-up and that the same had come to be associated exclusively with and be distinctive of the plaintiff`s instant coffee mix and no-one else`s by reason of extensive use as well as widespread and significant sales and advertising volume. To substantiate this assertion, the plaintiff stated that during the period from 1994 to June 1996, it had sold approximately 220 million sachets of MacCoffee for sales revenues of approximately US$16m.
 16.The defendant`s main business lies in the import and sale of rice and sugar. In late 1993, it signed a lease with the Jurong Town Corporation for the rental of its present premises. It was a condition of the lease that the defendant manufacture or process food products on the premises. The defendant therefore decided to go into the business of manufacturing instant beverages as a side line.
 17.Mr Eng Yew Beng joined the defendant in January 1994 as its sales manager in charge of the production and marketing of its new products. Some time in July 1994, the defendant started to manufacture and sell instant cereal, 3-in-1 instant coffee mix and chrysanthemum tea under the brand `Supreme`. The Supreme products were sold mainly to the defendant`s existing network of retailers for rice and were also exported to Malaysia and Taiwan. Unfortunately, the sales of Supreme 3-in-1 instant coffee mix were not good.
 18.The feedback that Mr Eng received was that in the Singapore market there were many established brands and for a new product like Supreme, price was a crucial factor. The Malaysian and Taiwanese buyers also stated that Supreme was considered expensive. They added, too, that the packaging was unfashionable and conservative and what was needed was a more attractive contemporary or `American` design. Mr Eng was informed that an attractively designed product with a competitive price would be ideal for the Taiwanese and Malaysian markets.
 19.The defendant was not able to reduce the price of Supreme coffee mix as its ingredients were of a high quality. It therefore decided to launch a new brand of instant coffee mix which would not only be price competitive but also have an attractive contemporary or American style packaging. According to Mr Eng, the name `A MaxCoffee` was conceived by his sales team. He himself came up with the name `A Max`. The `A` in the name was to signify high or best quality. It could also mean `American`. He decided on `Max` because it was a play on the word `mix` as the product was a mix of coffee powder, milk powder and sugar. Taken together, the words `A Max` were also close to `Amex` which was well-known and American.
 20.Mr Eng testified that the packaging of A MaxCoffee was designed by a Mr Goh of Porton Commercial Art. He gave Mr Goh the `A MaxCoffee` name and told him to produce a packaging which was attractive and fashionable with a distinctly American flavour. Mr Eng also gave Mr Goh some samples of packaging of the leading coffee mix brands. These samples included `Super`, `Mr Cafe` and `Owl`.
 21.The get-up which was finally approved and produced for A MaxCoffee was described by Mr Eng as follows: (a). The package is rectangular in shape approximately 24cm by 23cm. There is a red band of varying width at the top. It ranges from 5cm on the left corner to 12cm at the right corner. Two thin white lines run the length of the red band.
 (b). On the red background, the words `A MaxCoffee` appear in yellow/orange. The `A` is about 5cm high. The `MaxCoffee` is about 4cm high and altogether the name `A MaxCoffee` stretches from 22cm.
 (c). Immediately below the letter `A` is a big blue and white star measuring 10cm high and 10cm wide. On the same line as the star are the words `3-in-1 Instant Coffee Mix` in bright yellow.
 (d). Below the star are the Chinese words `American Flavour` in blue.
 (e). The centre portion of the packaging is brown/choco in colour. There is a picture of a coffee cup and saucer surrounded by coffee beans. The banner `True American Taste` appears below the cup and saucer.
 22.Mr Eng also gave a description of the plaintiff`s MacCoffee packaging which included some elements not mentioned by the plaintiff in its statement of claim. He said that the top left half to the packaging is covered by the American flag, the Stars and Stripes. An eagle measuring 8cm high and 20cm wide is the most prominent feature on the top half. It is in `striking` black, brown, yellow and white colours. It is clutching an olive branch and three arrows respectively in each talon. Below the eagle is the word `MacCoffee` (also in orangy/yellowey hues although Mr Eng does not point this out). The legend `3-in-1 Instant Coffee Mix` appears immediately below `MacCoffee`. The middle of the packaging is beige/kaki in colour. There is a coffee cup surrounded by coffee beans and the legend `True American Taste` in blue and red runs from left to right at an angle.
 23.Some time in October 1995, the defendant started selling A MaxCoffee. Invoices for local sales were produced. Unfortunately, the Taiwanese and Malaysian markets failed to develop and the defendant now sells A MaxCoffee primarily in Singapore. The defendant has exported some A MaxCoffee to Indonesia. In September 1996 and February 1997, it sold A MaxCoffee to Nissho Iwai International (S) Ltd, which then exported the goods to Vietnam. From October 1995 up to the date of the affidavit, ie 29 May 1997, the defendant had sold approximately three thousand cartons (50 sachets x 20g x 20 packets) of A MaxCoffee. The ratio of local sales to export sales was about 16:1.
 24.In February 1997, the defendant`s solicitors engaged Consumer Probe (S) Pte Ltd, a private research company, to carry out a survey to find out whether buyers of 3-in-1 coffee mix in Singapore could differentiate between the packaging of MacCoffee and that of A MaxCoffee. The researcher divided the buyers into two groups: end-users and the trade sector. She conducted face-to-face interviews with 150 Singaporeans aged 21 to 55 who had bought any brand of coffee mix within the preceding three months. These comprised the end-user group. The trade sector was made of provision shop owners, supermarket supervisors and wholesalers. Fifty interviews were conducted among members of this group.
 25.The first finding of the researcher was that the most popular 3-in-1 coffee mix brands judging by those most purchased during the preceding three months, were Super (28%), Nescafe (25%) and Owl (23%). MacCoffee and A MaxCoffee had each a very small market share in the 3-in-1 coffee mix segment. Neither of them was mentioned by any end-user as being the brand most often purchased during the preceding three months. Among provision shops, only 3% sold A MaxCoffee whilst 6% sold MacCoffee. As for the wholesalers/exporters, 17% had sold A MaxCoffee whilst none had sold MacCoffee. Among the ten supermarkets and minimarts surveyed, only two sold A MaxCoffee and only one sold MacCoffee.
 26.Each of the interviewees was shown a MacCoffee package and an A MaxCoffee package. Among the consumers, 50% considered that the two designs came from different manufacturers while the other half thought that they had been produced by the same maker. Persons in the trade were slightly better at differentiating the products - 52% thought they came from different manufacturers. 66% of the consumers were, however, able to distinguish the two brand names stating that A MaxCoffee and MacCoffee were distinctive different brands. So were 68% of the traders.

 General principles
The elements of the tort of passing off were identified by both Lord Diplock and Lord Fraser in the case of 
Erven Warnink BV v J Townend & Sons (Hull) Ltd
 
[1979] AC 731
 (the 
 Advocaat 
 case). As Oliver LJ put it in 
Anheuser Busch Inc v Budejovicky Budvar
 
[1984] FSR 413
 at pp 462-463: 
The most recent and most authoritative exegesis of the essential elements of a claim in passing off is to be found in the speeches of Lord Diplock and Lord Fraser in [the Advocaat case] Lord Diplock identified five characteristics as common to all passing-off actions, although he uttered a caution against assuming that the presence of all five in any factual situation necessarily give rise to a cause of action. No claim could, however, succeed in the absence of all five. Thus there is required to be found:
 
`(1) a misrepresentation; (2) made by a trader in the course of trade; (3) to prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by him; (4) which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader (in the sense that this is a reasonably foreseeable consequence); and (5) which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill to the trader by whom the action is brought or (in a quia timet action) will probably do so.`
 
These essentials were expressed slightly differently by Lord Fraser as follows:
 
`It is essential for the plaintiff in a passing-off action to show at least the following facts: (1) that his business consists of, or includes, selling in England a class of goods to which the particular trade name applies; (2) that the class of goods is clearly defined, and that in the minds of the public, or a section of the public, in England, the trade name distinguishes that class from other similar goods; (3) that because of the reputation of the goods, there is goodwill attached to the name; (4) that he, the plaintiff as a member of the class of those who sell the goods, is the owner of goodwill in England which is of substantial value; (5) that he has suffered, or is really likely to suffer, substantial damage to his property in the goodwill by reason of the defendant selling goods which are falsely described by the trade name to which the goodwill is attached.`
 
These two statements of principle complement one another, Lord Diplock emphasising what has been done by the defendant to give rise to the complaint, and Lord Fraser what the plaintiff has to show as a prerequisite of complaining. Since the remaining members of its Lordships` House agreed with both speeches, it is not in dispute that the two statements have to be taken as a composite.
 28.Although there are five elements which have to be established in order to substantiate an action for passing off, the facts of this case and the submissions which have been made are focused principally on two issues: first, whether the plaintiff has established that there was goodwill attached to the name `MacCoffee` in Singapore; and secondly whether the defendant misrepresented its coffee mix as MacCoffee.
 29.
 Goodwill
The most generally accepted definition of goodwill is the famous one formulated by Lord Macnaghten in 
IRC v Muller & Co`s Margarine Ltd
 
[1901] AC 217
. It is, I think, worth reproducing his Lordship`s words in full: 
What is goodwill? It is a thing very easy to describe, very difficult to define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in custom. It is the one thing which distinguishes an old established business from a new business at its first start. The goodwill of a business must emanate from a particular centre or source. However widely extended or diffused its influence may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates.
 
Goodwill regarded as property has no meaning except in connection with some trade, business, or calling. In that connection I understand the word to include whatever adds value to a business by reason of situation, name and reputation, connection, introduction to old customers, and agreed absence from competition, or any of these things, and there may be others which do not occur to me. In this wide sense, goodwill is inseparable from the business to which it adds value, and, in my opinion, exists where the business is carried on. Such business may be carried on in one place or country or in several, and if in several there may be several businesses, each having a goodwill of its own (at pp 223-224).
 30.Several important elements of goodwill can be derived from the above passage. The first is that in order to have goodwill there must be a business, trade or calling. This case involves the sale of goods ie a trade and the observations I make are limited to that context. Second, goodwill is the power of attraction which draws the customers to buy the goods. The third element is that goodwill is territorial because it only exists where the trade exists. If therefore a party sells goods in Singapore solely, he will have goodwill here but will not have goodwill in a third country like Malaysia or Indonesia. Similarly, a person who sells goods in Malaysia but not in Singapore will have goodwill in Malaysia but not here.
 31.It appears from the 
 Anheuser Busch 
 case that this would be so even if the goods sold in Malaysia are made in Singapore as long as they are not available in the market here. O`Connor LJ in that case observed: 
I am in no doubt that the evidence showed that by 1973 the plaintiffs` Budweiser beer enjoyed a significant reputation among members of the public in this country. That is not sufficient to found an action for passing off. It is
 the goodwill of a business carried on in this country
 that can be protected, not the reputation - goodwill if you like, of the business carried on in another country. [Italics mine.]
 The facts of that case are particularly interesting in that the plaintiffs` Budweiser beer was sold in England but only in United States military and diplomatic establishments. These cans were available for purchase, duty free, by serving American and by British employees of American service establishments. However, those sales were not considered to constitute the carrying on by the plaintiffs of a business in England in any real sense since no ordinary member of the general public could go out and buy a can of Budweiser beer as and when he wanted it. It is also notable that Oliver LJ, just before the passage I quoted earlier setting out the formulations on the law in the 
 Advocaat 
 case, stated that the basic question which the court had to consider was how far it was an essential ingredient of a successful claim in passing off that the plaintiffs should have established 
 in England 
 (italics mine) a business in which its services or goods were sold to the general public on the open market (at p 462).
 32.Many authorities have been cited to me by both sides. I need not recite all of them. I have arrived at the conclusion that in order for the plaintiff to establish that it has a goodwill in MacCoffee which can be protected, it has to show that it carried on business in MacCoffee in Singapore. It is not enough for the plaintiff to establish, as its counsel argued, that it is incorporated in Singapore and makes the MacCoffee here. The plaintiff as a company may have earned some goodwill simply by virtue of existing here and carrying on a manufacturing business but that goodwill would attach to the plaintiff`s own name and not to the name of its products unless those products are also available in the local market and have a local reputation. I therefore draw a distinction between the goodwill that may be attached to the corporation Futures Enterprises Pte Ltd which carries on manufacturing business in Singapore and the goodwill attached to the product `MacCoffee`. Just because the plaintiff has some general goodwill in Singapore does not mean it also has a specific goodwill relating to MacCoffee which it can enforce as a property right.
 33.Also, as Lord Macnaughten pointed out, businesses may be carried out in one place or country or in several and if in several, there will be several businesses each having a goodwill of its own. In this case, the evidence is that the plaintiff carried out extensive trade in MacCoffee in Russia. It would therefore have substantial goodwill for MacCoffee in Russia. The plaintiff has argued that the goodwill it has gained internationally, not only in Russia but in other countries as well (though the evidence adduced was substantially that of Russian sales) would contribute to goodwill existing in Singapore. That does not appear to be the case if one applies the 
 Anheuser Busch 
 holdings.
 34.The main thrust of the defendant`s case on this issue is that the plaintiff has not discharged the onus of showing that it traded sufficiently in MacCoffee in Singapore at the relevant time so as to build up a reputation which would have translated into goodwill attaching to that brand. The immediate question is: what is the relevant time at which the existence or non-existence of goodwill relating to MacCoffee has to be adjudged? The defendant submitted, and the plaintiff did not dispute, that the relevant date is the date of commencement of the conduct of the defendant which is complained about. This submission is well supported. See 
Jordache Enterprises Inc v Millennium Pte Ltd
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 281
  which was recently followed by 
Pontiac Marina Pte Ltd v CDL Hotels International Ltd
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 726
 . In the instant case, the defendant`s position is that it started selling A MaxCoffee in Singapore in October 1995. The plaintiff has not seriously challenged that date although its statement of claim puts March 1996 as the time when the defendant started passing off A MaxCoffee as MacCoffee. The documentary evidence substantiates the defendant`s October 1995 date. Thus, that is the date at which I have to determine whether the plaintiff had any goodwill in MacCoffee. The evidence of such goodwill at that date is meagre, to put it mildly.
 35.The plaintiff`s main intention when it started manufacturing MacCoffee was to market the MAC products overseas since it considered foreign markets to be relatively undeveloped and more susceptible to its products than the local market which the plaintiff considered to be `saturated`. Accordingly, the plaintiff`s initial sales were to Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, Vietnam, United Arab Emirates and Pakistan. Mr Tan had claimed that the plaintiff commenced sales of MacCoffee to these countries in August 1994. No evidence was produced to substantiate this claim. The invoices he did adduce showed exports made from July 1995 onwards.
 36.Mr Tan said that owing to these exports of MacCoffee, the plaintiff had acquired goodwill in MacCoffee in their export markets and in Singapore as well, especially in the export trade community. When in cross-examination, Mr Tan was asked whether he had any evidence of the plaintiff`s goodwill in Singapore, especially in the export trade community, his answer was no. The plaintiff did not call any evidence to show the existence of an export trade community in Singapore nor was any person claiming to be a member of such community called to give evidence on the plaintiff`s behalf of the reputation which MacCoffee enjoyed in that community at the material time.
 37.The plaintiff produced its profit and loss statement for 1995. Two items in these accounts referred to the sale of `beverages`. Mr Tan said the term `beverage` meant the seven or eight different drinks including MacCoffee which the plaintiff sold that year. The two items were `sales - beverages` and `O/Seas sales beverages` and against each of these items were two figures (presumably in Singapore dollars), the first representing sales for the month of December 1995 and the second representing sales for the whole of 1995 up to 31 December. In the case of `sales - beverages` the figure for the whole of 1995 was $508,329.96 and in the case of `O/Seas sales - beverages` (which, it is common ground referred to overseas-sales of beverages), the corresponding figure was $17,136,656.99. Mr Tan explained that the figure $508,329.96 was an audit adjustment done at the year-end in respect of shipments in transit to overseas markets that had not reached their final destination as at 31 December 1995 and therefore had to be adjusted for the following year`s sales. This figure was in fact deducted from the plaintiff`s total sales figure for 1995. It is interesting that there was no entry in the 1995 accounts for local sales of beverages. Such an item did appear in the plaintiff`s profit and loss statement for 1996 and what was described there as `local sales - bev` was shown as having amounted to a figure of $248,237.26 for the whole of 1996.
 38.It was not till August 1996 that the plaintiff appointed a distributor for its MAC beverages in Singapore. Whilst that does not preclude sales having been made in 1995, it is an indication that the plaintiff was not making much effort to penetrate the local market that year. Further, there was no evidence of any local sales of MacCoffee in 1995 produced by the plaintiff at the trial. No invoices of goods sold to wholesalers, provision shops, minimarts or supermarkets were produced. Neither did any personnel from any such merchandising outlet testify that he or she had purchased MacCoffee from the plaintiff for resale to either the local retail trade or the general public. Nor did any member of the public come forward to say that he or she had purchased MacCoffee in 1995 whether on a regular basis or otherwise. The inference must be that sales of MacCoffee in Singapore in 1995 were minimal.
 39.The plaintiff also attempted to establish its goodwill by reference to advertising and promotion of MacCoffee. Mr Tan said that the plaintiff had expended considerable sums in promoting the product both in the emerging markets as well as in Singapore. However, the evidence of marketing produced related to the Russian market. When Mr Tan was asked in cross-examination if he had any evidence to show that the plaintiff had spent money to promote and publicise MacCoffee in Singapore, his reply was that he did not have such evidence. It would be recalled that the plaintiff had claimed advertising MacNoodles on television in Singapore for a month in 1995. Obviously, no similar campaign was mounted for MacCoffee.
 40.Although the plaintiff did advertise their products in 
 Singapore Exporters 
 and 
 Singapore Food and Beverage 
, two local trade publications, Mr Tan`s own testimony was that these advertisements were only placed in 1996. There was no evidence of any such advertisements having been placed in 1995. Further, though Mr Tan claimed that as a result of his 1996 advertisements, the plaintiff had received enquiries on its product from exporters or traders, he also told the court that he would not be calling such exporters or traders to testify.
 41.Practically the only evidence that MacCoffee was available in the local market prior to October 1995 was the admission made by Mr Eng that at the time he gave his artist instructions to prepare the packaging for A MaxCoffee he was aware of the plaintiff`s product. That in itself, however, is insufficient to show that MacCoffee as such had acquired a certain goodwill or reputation in Singapore. Sporadic sales without any evidence of a certain level of local consumer/vendor awareness of the brand and its availability cannot in themselves constitute the acquisition of a reputation in Singapore.
 42.In his closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiff recognised that it did not have significant sales of MacCoffee in Singapore and that the product had no widespread brand name recognition in Singapore. Counsel submitted, however, that it did not follow that the plaintiff had no goodwill in Singapore and that the proper approach to be adopted to ascertain the existence of goodwill within the jurisdiction was to ask whether the plaintiff was incorporated within the jurisdiction. If the answer to that question was yes, then prima facie the plaintiff would enjoy goodwill and reputation here. As I have stated earlier in this judgment, I do not accept that approach because I believe a distinction has to be drawn between the goodwill that attaches to the plaintiff as a company and the goodwill that attaches to its product MacCoffee. In this case it is seeking to protect the latter property right and in order to do so, it must establish that that property exists. In my judgment, the plaintiff has failed to discharge the burden of proof of establishing that when the defendant started selling A MaxCoffee in Singapore, MacCoffee already enjoyed sufficient reputation and goodwill to found an action for passing off.
 43.
 Misrepresentation
Although the plaintiff has failed to establish its goodwill, I will consider the issue of misrepresentation briefly. I should say first that I consider that Mr Eng did obtain the inspiration for A MaxCoffee from MacCoffee. His explanation on how he arrived at the name was not convincing especially since he sought to convince me that he himself was the originator of `A Max` as a play on the words `mix` and `Amex`. Mr Eng gave his evidence in Mandarin and although he obviously knew English, he did not appear to me to have the sophisticated command of the language that would have led to him conceiving `A Max` in the way he said he did. I believe that after he was told that his Supreme coffee mix had failed because of stodgy packaging, he was casting around for some new ideas and when he came across MacCoffee, he adopted the name and the idea of promoting an American taste as a marketing tool.
 44.There are also several similarities between the presentation of the MacCoffee brand and the A MaxCoffee brand particularly in relation to the way in which the name itself is presented. These similarities are: (1). the defendant copied the plaintiff`s idea of making the brand name a composite of two words with two capital letters one at the beginning and the other being the capital `C` in the middle at the start of the word `coffee`;
 (2). the type-faces used by both parties are the same;
 (3). the gradated colours in the names are similar;
 (4). the letters comprising `MacCoffee` and `A MaxCoffee` both employ drop shadows and such drop shadows are not found in the letters comprising the names of other coffee mix brands;
 (5). the plaintiff`s and defendant`s products are the only two coffee mixes which bear the legend `True American Taste`.
 The plaintiff said also that the wavy red and white striped banner at the top of the defendant`s packet when taken together with the single blue and white star which is superimposed over part of the banner is intended to be reminiscent of the American flag which appears at the top of the plaintiff`s package and it is true that one may get an `American` impression from the banner with the star next to it.
 45.The question that arises, however, is whether the final product A MaxCoffee, although clearly derived from the plaintiff`s product, is sufficiently differentiated from MacCoffee so as not to cause any confusion.
 46.The plaintiff`s case is that misrepresentation by the defendant is in the latter`s name and get-up. First, as regards the name, there is a striking objective similarity between the names MacCoffee and MaxCoffee. Both of these names are pronounced in approximately the same way. As regards the `A` in A MaxCoffee, the plaintiff`s submission is that this can be disregarded because in actual usage when the package is filled with the coffee sachets, the package would curve away from the edges and this would cause the letter `A` to be obscured whereas `MaxCoffee` would appear prominently.
 47.The plaintiff also relied on the evidence of Ms Tan who had carried out the consumer survey for Consumer Probe (S) Pte Ltd. She confirmed in court that although the survey questionnaire proceeded on the assumption that the defendant`s product was called `A MaxCoffee`, in practice a fair proportion of respondents in the survey actually referred to the defendant`s product as `MaxCoffee`. Further, in a letter that the defendant`s solicitors wrote to the solicitors for Super Coffeemix Ltd, the said solicitors referred to the defendant`s product as `MaxCoffee` rather than as `A MaxCoffee`. The plaintiff submitted that therefore not only would consumers in practice call the defendant`s product `MaxCoffee` but that the defendant itself intended this to be the name of its product rather than `A MaxCoffee`. I consider it likely that under actual conditions in the market, consumers would be likely to drop the letter `A` or lay stress on the `MaxCoffee` portion of the name.
 48.The only evidence which I had as to how the general public would perceive the two products came from the survey by Consumer Probe. This showed that 50% of consumers thought that the two packages were made by the same manufacturers. In the trade sector, almost half ie 48% also thought that the two packages came from the same manufacturer. The respondents were also asked whether the two packages were of the same brand. Among the consumers, 34% thought that they were the same brand whilst 32% of the traders took that view as well. These were substantial minorities. The main reasons why the brands were perceived as being the same were the colour schemes and the spelling of the two brand names.
 49.As stated by Yong Pung How CJ in 
Tong Guan Food Products Pte Ltd v Hoe Huat Hng Foodstuff Pte Ltd
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 361
  
[1991] SLR 133
 , the test for comparison of confusingly similar names, marks or other distinguishing indicia is not to compare them side by side but to take into account the fact that confusion which may occur will take place when the customer has in his mind his recollection of the plaintiff`s mark which may be only an idea of the whole or actual mark.
 50.In my judgment, the similarity between the two products particularly by reason of the brand names employed and the overall impression of the packaging, is high. I consider that a substantial proportion of consumers are likely to mistake one for the other especially if they do not spend much time studying the different get-ups. Since the product in question is not a very expensive item and would usually be purchased by a consumer in the course of stocking up on various provisions and not just coffee mix, such purchaser is likely to simply pick the product off a shelf or ask the vendor for it without examining it very closely. The product would not get the same kind of scrutiny that a more expensive item like a camera or television set would. In this case quite apart from my own views on similarity, there is evidence of actual confusion among the respondents to the survey. On balance, I hold that the plaintiff has proved that the defendant`s A MaxCoffee is likely to be confused for its MacCoffee.
 51.This holding does not, however, avail the plaintiff since it did not build up a sufficient reputation in MacCoffee in Singapore before the defendant`s product came onto the market. My decision is limited to the situation in Singapore and I am not making any finding as to the goodwill which MacCoffee enjoys in other markets. In fact, on the evidence which I have seen, MacCoffee appears to have a substantial reputation in Russia. Nothing in this judgment would prevent the plaintiff from protecting its goodwill in that market and others where MacCoffee is widely sold if the defendant decides to introduce A MaxCoffee in those markets.
 52.In the circumstances, the plaintiff`s action fails and must be dismissed with costs.",1997-11-26 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This was a petition for a criminal revision arising out of a conviction under s 354 Penal Code (Cap 224) for the use of criminal force on a victim by pressing her left breast twice with an intent to outrage her modesty. The petitioner pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to six months` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane by the magistrate below. The petition was brought on the basis that the proceedings in the court below were flawed, culminating in a miscarriage of justice.
 2.The petition came up for hearing before me on 14 October 1997. After hearing the submissions made by the petitioner`s counsel, I felt it unnecessary to call on the Deputy Public Prosecutor to reply and dismissed the petition. I now set out the grounds of my decision.
 3.
 The charge
The petitioner faced the following charge: 
MAC 7160/97
 
You, Rajeevan Edakalavan, M/27 years old
 
FIN No F2495837-W
 
are charged that you on or about the 26 June 1997 at or about 11.35pm, inside TIBS bus service 851, travelling along Ang Mo Kio Ave 6, Singapore, did use criminal force on one Murthy Ally, to wit, by pressing her left breast twice, intending to outrage her modesty, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 4.
 The facts
The facts were straightforward and largely undisputed. At the trial below, the petitioner admitted to all the facts set out in the statement of facts without qualification.
 5.The petitioner is a 27 year old Indian national and held an employment pass in Singapore. He was working as a technical specialist at National Semi-Conductor prior to the alleged commission of the offence. The victim was a 24 year old Indian lady named Murthy Ally.
 6.On 26 June 1997, at about 11.15pm, the victim boarded TIBS bus service number 851 along Shunfu Road, which was heading towards the direction of Yishun. She took the aisle seat on the left side of the bus, second row from the rear exit. A Chinese lady occupied the window seat beside her. The petitioner was seated directly behind the Chinese lady. A while later, the Chinese lady alighted the bus. The victim then moved to the window seat which was previously occupied by the Chinese lady. As the victim was tired, she took a nap, with her head leaning against the window.
 7.At about 11.35pm, as the bus was passing along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, the petitioner slipped his left hand through the gap between the window and the victim`s seat. He pressed against the victim`s blouse twice at her left breast region. This act alerted the victim. She turned around and shouted at the petitioner who apologised immediately. At the same time, a male passenger was alerted by the victim`s screams and saw the petitioner pulling his fingers away from the gap between the window and the victim`s seat. He kept watch over the petitioner. The driver was informed of the incident and drove the bus to Yishun Bus Interchange.
 8.At about 11.40pm, the informant, one Mr Zainal, called the police and reported that a male subject had been detained for molest on board TIBS bus service number 851. The petitioner was arrested and brought to Ang Mo Kio Police Division.
 9.The petitioner was charged under s 354 Penal Code on 27 June 1997. At the trial before the magistrate on 28 June 1997, the petitioner appeared in person without begin represented by counsel. He pleaded guilty to the charge and was convicted accordingly.
 10.
 The petition for criminal revision
The fundamental ground on which the petitioner based the application to urge this court to exercise its discretionary powers of revision was that the proceedings of the trial below was such that it contravened art 9(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. Article 9(1) provides: 
No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.
 11.There were two main submissions in support of the petition: (i). upon his arrest, the petitioner was immediately taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital to undergo a test to determine his blood alcohol content. Blood samples were taken from him for analysis. However, the statement of facts failed to address his medical condition and blood alcohol level at the time of his arrest. No mention was made as to the examination at the hospital;
 (ii). the petitioner was not represented and was not advised of his legal right to counsel. Thus, his plea could not be considered unequivocal. He was in a state of confusion when he pleaded guilty. He was under the mistaken belief that he had no defence to the charge. In reality, at the time of the commission of the offence, he was so drunk that he was incapable of forming any intention and/or did not realise what he was doing. It was submitted that had the court been informed of the petitioner`s state of mind and his blood alcohol level, it would have sought further clarification before being satisfied that the plea of guilt was unequivocal. Also, being unrepresented, the petitioner was unaware that a charge under s 354 was compoundable under s 199 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). In light of the above, the petitioner had pleaded guilty in total ignorance of the law, in particular, the defences which were open to him.
 12.At this juncture it is pertinent to take note that on 13 October 1997, the eve of the hearing, the petitioner`s solicitors filed an affidavit and enclosed a medical report on the petitioner dated 3 October 1997. The report stated that the petitioner was examined at the Accident and Emergency department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 27 June 1997 at about 4.35am. Upon examination, it was found that he was rational and that his heart and lungs were clear. There was no evidence of any external injury. His blood sample contained 43mg of ethanol per 100ml of blood.
 13.In determining whether the allegations put forth by the petitioner merited the use of the discretionary powers of revision by the High Court under s 268 CPC, a few crucial issues required further scrutiny: (i). scope of art 9(3) of the Constitution;
 (ii). whether the petitioner should have been advised of the defences, if any, available to him;
 (iii). validity and unequivocability of the petitioner`s plea of guilt;
 (iv). availability of a plea of defence of intoxication.
 They were considered in turn.
 14.
 Scope of art 9(3) of the Constitution
The petitioner submitted that, as he was not informed of his right to legal representation, his plea of guilt could not be said to be unequivocal. The issue which presented itself before this court was whether a person under arrest has a right to be informed of his constitutional right to counsel under art 9(3). To put it in another way, is there an obligation imposed on the police or other relevant authorities to inform the person under arrest of his right to counsel? Article 9(3) reads as follows: 
Where a person is arrested, he shall be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and 
 shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice
.
 In order to resolve this question, a few cases from other jurisdictions on this issue were reviewed to see how similar provisions on the right to counsel were interpreted.
 15.The first case was 
A-G of Trinidad and Tobago & Anor v Whiteman
 
[1991] 2 WLR 1200
, a decision of the Privy Council on an appeal from the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and Tobago. There, the applicant was arrested and detained in a police cell for a period. He claimed that at no time during his detention was he informed of his right to communicate with a lawyer. He brought an originating motion for relief. The primary issue before the Privy Council was whether a person upon arrest and detention by the police had a constitutional right to be informed of his constitutional right to retain and instruct a legal adviser of his choice and to hold communication with him. The Privy Council answered this question in the positive. However, this case must be viewed with caution as the decision was based on the interpretation of the wording of the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago, which is markedly different from that in Singapore. The relevant provisions should first be set out: 
5(2) Without prejudice to subsection (1), Parliament may not - 
 
 
(c) deprive a person who has been arrested or detained - 
 
 
(ii) of the right to retain and instruct without delay a legal adviser of his own choice and to hold communication with him 
 
 
(h) deprive a person of the right to such procedural provisions as are necessary for the purpose of giving effect and protection to the aforesaid rights and freedoms
 Section 5(2)(c)(ii) is worded in a similar fashion to art 9(3). However, there is no equivalent to s 5(2)(h) in our Constitution. This distinction is significant. From a reading of the leading judgment of Lord Keith of Kinkel, it is clear that s 5(2)(h) was the pivotal factor in their Lordships` coming to the decision that there was a constitutional right to be so informed of the right to counsel. According to their Lordships, s 5(2)(h) was specifically enacted to confer upon the person arrested a right to be informed of his right set out in s 5(2)(c)(ii). As stated at p 1204 on the interpretation of s 5(2)(h): 
Section 5(2)(h) is properly to be regarded as intended to deal with that kind of situation as well as other kinds of situation where some different constitutional rights might otherwise be at risk of not being given effect and protection. There are no grounds for giving a restricted meaning to the words `procedural provisions`. A procedure is a way of going about things, and a provision is something which lays down what that way is to be. Given that there are some situations where the right to communicate with a legal adviser will not be effective if no provision exists for some procedure to be followed with a view to dealing with these situation, there is a clear necessity that such provision should be made. So s 5(2)(h) gives a right to such a provision.
 Another consideration which their Lordships took into account was the fact that in 1965, the judges of Trinidad and Tobago adopted the 1964 English Judges` Rules, including App B, para 8(b) which provides: 
Persons in custody should not only be informed orally of the rights and facilities available to them, but in addition, notices describing them should be displayed at convenient and conspicuous places at police stations and the attention of persons in custody should be drawn to these notices.
 Again, such guidelines have no equivalent in Singapore. As Lord Keith remarked at p 1205, the whole decision was based: 
both upon a proper construction of s 5(2)(h) of the Constitution of 1976 and on the basis of the settled practice existing (reflected in para 8(b)of the 1964 English Judges` Rules) when that Constitution was introduced.
 The decision is thus easily distinguishable. The findings were made in connection with the specific provisions of the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago which are clearly in stark contrast to our art 9(3). It does not provide a strong argument that the scope of art 9(3) should be interpreted in the same manner.
 16.The next case which was considered was 
Miranda v Arizona
 
[1966] 
384 US 436
, a decision of the United States Supreme Court. The court dealt with the admissibility of statements obtained from an individual who was subjected to custodial police interrogation and the necessity for procedures which assure that the individual is accorded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution not to be compelled to incriminate himself. The Fifth Amendment reads: 
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; 
 nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself
, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.
 The Supreme Court laid down this seminal ruling: 
Accordingly, we hold that an individual held for interrogation must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation under the system for protecting the privilege we delineate.
 An academic writer has cited this case as a ground for the argument that Singapore should follow suit even though the right to be informed of the constitutional protection conferred by art 9(3) has not been specifically spelt out. Sweeping and unequivocal as the statement may seem at first glance with regards to the right to be informed of the constitutional right to counsel, a closer reading of Chief Justice Warren`s judgment reveals that this pronouncement has to be read in its proper context. The privilege sought to be protected is the privilege against self-incrimination in the Fifth Amendment. True, the Fifth Amendment does not explicitly provide for the right to be informed as in our art 9(3), or even for the right to counsel itself. However, it must be stressed that the court was dealing with the narrower issue of the procedural measures which should be enacted to safeguard the privilege against self-incrimination during the interrogation process and not the broader issue of the right to be informed of the constitutional right to counsel per se. It has been firmly established in 
PP v Mazlan bin Maidun & Anor
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 512
  that there is no constitutional right against self-incrimination or to silence under art 9(1). There is no equivalent of the Fifth Amendment in Singapore. The decision in 
 Miranda v Arizona 
 does not provide a strong authority for reading into art 93(3) the right to be informed of one`s right to counsel. To so extrapolate it will be to take the decision completely out of context.
 17.Closer to home is the Malaysian case of 
Hashim bin Saud v Yahaya bin Hasim & Anor
 
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 259
 . The plaintiff sought damages for wrongful detention and the denial of the right to consult counsel under art 5(3) of the Constitution of Malaysia, which is worded identically to our art 9(3). At first instance, Harun J remarked by way of dicta at p 261: 
Article 5(3) prescribes that an arrested person shall be informed of the grounds of his arrest but does not prescribe that the arrested person shall be informed of his right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice. It merely prescribes that he shall be allowed.
 On appeal, the Federal Court did not comment on this particular statement. Harun J was of the opinion that there was no obligation to inform the person in custody of his right to counsel.
 18.What is the position in Singapore? There are two limbs to the right to counsel in art 9(3). The first limb is that a person under arrest shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner. The second limb is that he shall be allowed such legal practitioner 
 of his choice 
. The scope of these two limbs needs to be defined.
 19.Article 9(3) unequivocally states that a person under arrest `shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice`. The focus of the first limb is on the words `shall be allowed`. Under the first limb, one`s right to counsel is afforded constitutional protection. In other words, every person under arrest will not be denied access to counsel if he so desires one. The officer under whose custody he is in cannot be heard to say, `you have no right to be defended by a counsel of your choice`. That will be contrary to art 9(3) and a breach of the arrested person`s constitutional rights. However, nowhere in art 9(3) does it provide that there is a further right to be informed of one`s right to counsel, as the petitioner`s counsel put forth before this court. The right in art 9(3) is a negative right. The words `shall be allowed` are couched in negative terms in a sense that there is no obligation imposed on the relevant authority to inform and advise the person under custody of his right to counsel. This is in stark contrast to the right to be informed of the grounds of arrest in art 9(3). It is expressly provided that where a person is arrested, `
 he shall be informed 
as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest`. To read into the right to counsel in art 9(3) an additional constitutional right to be so informed will be tantamount to judicial legislation. The duty of the judge is to adjudicate and interpret the laws passed by parliament with the aim of ensuring that justice is upheld. He is in no position to expand the scope of or imply into the Constitution and other legislation his own interpretation of the provisions which is clearly contrary to parliament`s intention. In 
 PP v Mazlan bin Maidun 
, the Court of Appeal frowned upon unwarranted judicial legislation with respect to art 9(1) at p 516 of the judgment: 
In 
 Ong Ah Chuan v PP
 and 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP
, the Privy Council held that the word `law` in art 9(1) includes the principles of natural justice. However, the right of silence has never been regarded as subsumed under the principles of natural justice. It is a rule which originated as being largely evidential in nature. To say that the right of silence is a constitutional right would be to elevate an evidential rule to constitutional statues despite its having been given no explicit expression in the Constitution. Such an elevation requires in the interpretation of art 9(1) a degree of adventurous extrapolation which we do not consider justified. It is not a mere matter of balancing the prejudice to the administration of justice resulting from depriving the court of relevant and important evidence against the interest protected by this right.
 To accept the argument that there is a right to be so informed in the present situation will amount to this court acting as the legislature itself, in defiance of the clear wording of art 9(3).
 20.The second limb of the right to counsel is that one has a right to counsel of his choice. In my opinion, the words `of his choice` represent the gist of the right conferred by art 9(3). Not only is one allowed to have a right to counsel, he has a right to one of his choice. A person under arrest has the constitutional right to select a legal practitioner who he can consult and who can defend him.
 21.It is hence clear that the right conferred by art 9(3) is a right to a counsel of one`s choice. There is no constitutional right to be informed of one`s right to counsel under art 9(3). There has been criticism that to deprive one of the right to be informed will effectively amount to a negation of the right to counsel itself. In my opinion, that is pushing the case too far. The practical experiences in our judicial system bear testimony to the fact that such a conclusion is wholly speculative and unwarranted. Conversely, the safeguards in the Constitution and the criminal procedure process ensure that the rights of the accused are adequately protected. Any proposition to broaden the scope of the rights accorded to the accused should be addressed in the political and legislative arena. The judiciary, whose duty is to ensure that the intention of parliament as reflected in the Constitution and other legislation is adhered to, is an inappropriate forum. The members of parliament are freely elected by the people of Singapore. They represent the interests of the constituency who entrust them to act fairly, justly and reasonably. The right lies in the people to determine if any law passed be parliament goes against the principles of justice or otherwise. This right, the people exercise through the ballot box. The judiciary is in no position to determine if a particular piece of legislation is fair or reasonable as what is fair or reasonable is very subjective. If anybody has the right to decide, it is the people of Singapore. The sensitive issues surrounding the scope of fundamental liberties should be raised through our representatives in parliament who are the ones chosen by us to address our concerns. This is especially so with regards to matters which concern our well-being in society, of which fundamental liberties are a part.
 22.
 Whether the petitioner should have been advised of the defences, if any, available to him
The petitioner argued that as he was not aware of the defence of intoxication and the possibility of having the offence compounded, his plea of guilt could not be said to be unequivocal. It was further submitted that the petitioner should have been advised of these two avenues open to him before he pleaded guilty. Such an argument is untenable and strikes at the roots of the independence of the judge as the adjudicator. It is not the duty of the judge to inform the accused of the defences or other options that may be open to him and advantageous to his case. That is the duty of the counsel who is appointed to defend him in court, if the accused so chooses to be represented. The onus does not shift to the judge (or the prosecution, for that matter) simply because the accused is unrepresented. That will be placing too onerous a burden on the judge. Furthermore, the judge will be performing two completely incompatible and irreconcilable roles - one as the adjudicator, the other as the de facto defence counsel. The judge`s position of impartiality and independence will be gravely undermined. There will evidently be a conflict of interest and an issue of bias.
 23.Thus, I held that the magistrate did not err in not advising the petitioner of the defences available to him. The plea of guilt could not be said to be unequivocal in this respect.
 24.
 Validity and unequivocability of the petitioner`s plea of guilt
The trial below was dealt with summarily. Before an accused`s plea of guilt is accepted, the trial judge must ensure that the plea is valid and unequivocal. An invalid or equivocal plea is to be rejected. A plea must be unequivocal in the sense that it must signify without doubt and qualification the admission by the accused to all the ingredients of the offence and all the averments in the charge.
 25.The test in determining the validity of the plea of guilt was recently definitively laid down in 
Ganesun s/o Kannan v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 560
  where I approved of the three safeguards in the Malaysian case of 
Lee Weng Tuck v PP
 
 
[1989] 2 MLJ 143
  in deciding if the plea of guilt was valid. First, the court must ensure that it is the accused himself who wishes to plead guilty. The accused should plead guilty by his own mouth and not through his counsel. Secondly, the court must ascertain whether the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea. Thirdly, the court must establish that the accused intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him. The second and third safeguards are embodied in s 139 CPC read with s 180(a) and (b). All three safeguards must be satisfied before the plea is deemed valid and unequivocal. The established practice that, on a plea of guilt, the prosecution would supply the court with a statement of facts constituting the offence with which the accused was charged, was also considered. It was observed that the practice of recording the statement of facts had evolved into a legal duty and the court had to scrutinise the statement of facts for the explicit purpose of ensuring that all the elements of the charge were made out therein. This practice ties in with the third safeguard espoused.
 26.Following the principles set out in 
 Ganesun 
, I found that there was a valid and unequivocal plea of guilt. It is perhaps best to first reproduce the transcript of the summary proceedings before the magistrate: 
Prosecutor: Tenders charge against accused. 
Court: Charge admitted and marked `P1`. 
Charge read, explained and understood in English. 
Punishment prescribed by law explained to accused. 
Accused pleads guilty. 
Understands nature and consequences of plea. 
Prosecutor tenders statement of facts `A`. 
Prosecutor reads out `A`. 
Facts admitted by the accused without qualification. 
Court: Accused guilty and convicted. 
Antecedents: Nothing is known against the accused. 
Mitigation: I am admitting. In future I won`t repeat the offence. That is all. 
Court: Six months` imprisonment and three strokes.
 The petitioner himself pleaded guilty after having understood the nature and consequences of his plea and admitted to the statement of facts without qualification after the charge was read and explained to him. The magistrate did not deviate from the requisite procedure. There was no suggestion that the plea was made involuntarily or in ignorance of the consequences of the plea. The evidence showed that the petitioner knew exactly what he was doing when he pleaded guilty. No deception on the part of the court or the prosecution was imputed. The fact that the petitioner was not informed of his right to counsel or the defences open to him did not make the plea any less valid and unequivocal, on the reasoning which I set out above.
 27.
 Availability of a plea of defence of intoxication
In the petition for revision, the defence of intoxication under s 85(2)(b) Penal Code was pleaded. It was argued that, at the time of the commission of the offence, the petitioner was so drunk that he was incapable of forming any intention and/or did not realise what he was doing. However, the medical report of 3 October 1997 clearly indicated that the petitioner was sober. On examination by the medical officer at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, he was found to be rational. The level of ethanol in his blood was low. In light of the evidence, I did not hesitate to dismiss the plea of the defence of intoxication.
 28.After considering the various issues involved, I found that there were no grounds whatsoever for exercising the court`s powers of criminal revision. The petitioner had pleaded guilty unequivocally. There was no evidence that the plea was involuntary or oppressively induced. I was satisfied as to the correctness, legality, propriety and regularity of the findings in the proceedings below. There was no hint of a miscarriage of justice.
 29.In my view, the conviction and sentence against the petitioner should be upheld for the reasons set out above. Accordingly, I dismissed the petition.",1998-01-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

Cur Adv Vult
This action in conversion is for the recovery of 141 pieces of jewellery or their costs thereof. The 141 pieces were allegedly consigned by the first defendant (hereinafter called `Khong`) to the second defendant, Peter Lai Jewellery Pte Ltd (PLJ), a company whose business is in the retail of jewellery. PLJ has denied receipt of the same. The managing director of PLJ is one Steven Lai (Lai). The plaintiff (Selberan) is a Malaysian company and was and is in the business of manufacturing and marketing jewellery. Selberan was at all material times the employer of Khong. The 141 pieces belonged to Selberan.
 2.Khong joined Selberan as a marketing executive in 1980. In 1983 he was promoted to be the sales manager. At the relevant time he was the export manager of the Asia Pacific region. His job included the promotion and sales in Singapore of jewellery items (the goods) manufactured by Selberan. He would sell or consign the goods to shopkeepers like PLJ (hereinafter called `the customers`) and those customers would in turn retail them to the public.
 3.Khong would bring the goods down to Singapore from Kuala Lumpur and would keep them in a safe of a related company in Singapore called Selangor Pewter Singapore Pte Ltd (SPS). SPS would act as agent for Selberan in relation to the jewellery business of the latter and would also provide documentation back-up service to Selberan. Khong would take the goods from the safe to go on his business rounds. Though he would take the key to the safe from a staff of SPS, no one monitored his movements. No one in SPS supervised his work. For goods sold or consigned, Khong would use the documentation of SPS, for a sale, it would be the delivery order (DO) and for consignment, the miscellaneous delivery order (MDO). Each set of MDO comes in four copies - the first copy would be given to the customer and the second to fourth copies would be retained by Khong and kept in the SPS safe. As and when required, Khong would get a booklet of MDO from SPS.
 4.Khong asserted that the 141 pieces were consigned to PLJ and they were handed to and acknowledged by Lai. However, Lai denied having received the consignment of 141 pieces. When asked to produce proof of the consignment, Khong, after a lapse of some time, claimed that the three copies of the MDO, which Lai had acknowledged, were returned to Lai as requested by the latter. This claim is again denied by Lai.
 5.I should at this juncture mention that at the relevant period the financial year of Selberan ended on 30 June of each year. In accordance with the procedure existing then, Tan Keng Aun (PW1), the financial and administration manager of Selberan, was sent down to Singapore to do the usual annual stock-check. It was done on 10 July 1987. Apparently Tan Keng Aun saw (it must be what appeared to be) copies of the MDO for the 141 pieces and he even made a photocopy and brought it back with him to Kuala Lumpur. But he was not sure if what he saw were the original copies of the MDO or were they photocopies.
 6.Sometime before 17 July 1987, Chong Hong Chong (Chong), the operations manager of Selberan, and the immediate superior of Khong, was anxious of the status of the 141 pieces on consignment to PLJ. So he asked Khong to contact Lai and put forward certain proposals to him. It would appear that on 10 July 1987 Khong had a discussion with Lai on the consignment and on 17 July 1987 Khong wrote a letter (DB4) to Lai in these terms: 
Further to our discussion in your office on 10 July, we would like to confirm that you agree to the following terms of the consignment. 
(a) 141 pieces of jewellery are consigned to you at a value of S$51,398. 
(b) By 31 August 1987 you will have to decide whether to:
 
(i) return 50% or less of consignment stock and pay for the balance immediately of which you are entitled to a 10% discount; 
or 
(ii) agree to buy all 141 pieces at 15% discount payable in full on or before 31 October 1987.
 
that this is the single biggest ever purchase amount made by your company and that the credit period has not been stretched further than normal practice, you must agree that we have reduced our prices by a very substantial amount to acommodate your request.
 
I hope you are in agreement with the above arrangement and we should be grateful if you could kindly return to our office a signed and stamped copy of this document.
 7.This letter of 17 July 1987 was typed out in four copies. The first two copies were to be despatched to PLJ. The third copy was filed in the marketing file and the fourth in a float file ( a file for internal circulation in the office). Some days later, in early August 1987, a copy of the 17 July letter surfaced in the office of Selberan, and on the face of it bore a signature and a stamp. I shall hereinafter refer to this copy as `the acknowledged copy`. This acknowledged copy was filed by Yong Yoke Kim (Yong), the supervisor in the administration department of Selberan whose duties, inter alia, were to assist Khong in filing documents in the marketing files kept by Khong. Yong was the person who typed the 17 July letter for Khong.
 8.On 29 September and 2 October 1987 Khong appeared before a disciplinary inquiry to answer for the loss of certain jewellery items. The inquiry did not relate to the 141 pieces though the inquiry report did note that the 141 pieces were on consignment. On 30 September 1987, Khong tendered his resignation from Selberan. His last day in office was 11 October 1987. Thereafter Khong was on leave until the end of 1987. After Khong left the office of Selberan, the acknowledged letter could no longer be found.
 9.
 First defendant`s version
Khong said that in April 1987, 200 pieces of jewellery were consigned to PLJ. On 8 May 1987, Lai said that the designs of the 200 pieces were outdated and returned 59 pieces. The remaining 141 pieces were re-consigned to PLJ. At the time of the re-consignment, a fresh MDO was issued which Lai acknowledged with a signature and a stamp. As was the practice, the first copy was given to Lai and the other three copies were kept by Khong in the SPS` safe. On 31 July 1987, pursuant to a request of Lai, the three copies of the MDO were returned to Lai for verification with a view to cancellation. Khong averred that the three copies were never returned by Lai to Khong; neither were the 141 pieces returned to Khong. Khong admitted that this was the biggest consignment he had ever done.
 10.
 Second defendant`s version
Lai`s evidence is that there was a consignment of 200 pieces sometime in April/May 1987. I would observe that neither Selberan nor Khong nor PLJ produced the MDO for the 200 pieces. He said the consignment was offered by Khong as there was then a downturn in the jewellery market. Previously, PLJ had made direct purchases. Some four to six weeks later, the 200 pieces were returned to Khong because they were not saleable as the designs were somewhat outdated. Lai`s evidence was vague as to whether he returned the whole lot of 200 pieces or did he buy a few of them. His evidence was that thereafter PLJ did not hold any piece on consignment from Khong/Selberan.
 11.Lai vehemently denied having returned only 59 pieces and kept the remaining 141 pieces for continued consignment. He also denied having asked for and was given the three copies of the MDO relating to the consignment for 141 pieces for verification. He asked, even if there were such a consignment of 141 pieces, why was there a need for the other three copies of the MDO for verification as he would already have the first copy to do the verification. The 200 piece consignment was the first and only consignment PLJ obtained from Khong.
 12.As regards the acknowledged letter, Lai said he never saw it. Neither did he sign and stamp it to return to Selberan. It will be seen that the substantive merits of the case will have to be decided based on the credibility of either Khong or Lai.
 13.
 Acknowledged copy of letter
There are two main issues of fact. The first is, did PLJ in fact sign and stamp the 17 July 1987 letter acknowledging that they took the 141 pieces on consignment.
 14.I should point out that it is clear PLJ is separate and distinct from another entity called Peter Lai Pte Ltd (PLPL). Chong knew that the two entities were distinct. Yong, who saw the acknowledged letter, said that the stamp on it was round in shape. But she could not be certain whether it was a stamp of PLPL or PLJ. Chong said that he saw the two words `Peter Lai`. He wasn`t sure if it was the stamp of PLJ. All the documents disclosed to court show that PLJ`s stamp was always oblong in shape.
 15.Selberan`s witnesses could not say how the first two copies of the 17 July letter were despatched to PLJ. But they were left with Khong. Neither did they know how the acknowledged copy was returned to Selberan. Yong filed the acknowledged copy in the marketing file in the control of Khong. Khong said that having signed the letter (in quadruplicate) he left it in his out tray and he assumed it was posted to PLJ. He said he saw the acknowledged copy when it was returned, duly signed and stamped.
 16.Much was made of the fact that the witnesses for Selberan said that PLJ did not indicate on the acknowledged copy which of the two options PLJ would choose. But looking at the way the letter was worded I do not think it required PLJ to indicate its choice at the time. PLJ had until 31 August 1987 to decide.
 17.It was towards the end of October 1987 when Selberan wished to issue an invoice for the 141 pieces that the acknowledged copy could not be found in the marketing file. By then Khong had left Selberan. There was evidence before me which shows that shortly before Khong left Selberan`s premises he was clearing his own desk, making photocopies and taking away things. No one knew what he was taking.
 18.In my view it was clearly the duty of Khong to ensure that the letter reached PLJ and properly acknowledged. The 141 pieces were entrusted to him. From his evidence we see that he did not personally hand the 17 July letter over to PLJ; neither did he know how the acknowledged copy was returned to Selberan. At no time did he speak to Lai about the letter, not even on 31 July 1987 when he allegedly returned all three copies of the MDO to Lai and by which time he had already seen the acknowledged copy at Selberan`s office. Why didn`t he mention about the two proposals in the letter or get Lai`s confirmation that he had acknowledged the letter? Thus a big question mark hangs over the authenticity of the acknowledged copy. Furthermore, is the disappearance of the acknowledged copy a pure coincidence or is there something more sinister?
 19.
 Return of MDO
I now turn to the second issue of fact concerning the alleged return of the three copies of the MDO to Lai. It is clear from the evidence of Chong that he did not know much of the alleged practice adopted by Khong with regard to the returning of the 3 copies of the MDO to customers for verification and eventual cancellation. He left it to Khong. In this regard, Chong tried to draw a distinction between small and big consignments.
 20.It seems to me, at the end of the day, it is critical for Khong to give a credible explanation why there was a need to return the three copies of the MDO to Lai (or for that matter, other customers) for verification. Khong said the practice he adopted was what Mr and Mrs Angelmahr, who were two of the original shareholders in Selberan, taught him in the early eighties when he first joined Selberan. We have nothing but Khong`s word for that. It was emphasised that in the jewellery business a lot depends on trust. At the time PLJ was the largest customer of Selberan. PLJ was also a trusted customer. So he trusted Lai and returned the three copies of the MDO to him for verification without thinking too much about it.
 21.For an experienced jeweller, I do not think it would take too long to check 141 pieces against the MDO. Khong said the staff of PLJ went through 200 pieces in half an hour to one hour (NE 142). Furthermore, why was there a need to return the three copies of the MDO to a customer for verification when that customer has his own copy to do that? It was hardly prudent and I would be surprised if the Angelmahrs had taught him that. I would have thought that when a customer returns consigned goods all the safeguard he needed was for the salesman to cancel and sign the copy of the MDO which was held by the customer; whether the other copies of the MDO were also returned should not matter too much. In any event, even if all the copies of the MDO were needed to be produced for cancellation, to enable a line to be drawn across and for signing by the parties, it must surely be at the time when the consigned goods were actually returned.
 22.Khong also tried to explain that he only returned the three copies of the MDO to PLJ after having made photocopies of the MDO. According to him the photocopies were kept at SPS and Selberan. So it would not be critical if all the copies of the MDO were returned to Lai. But very strangely, now even the photocopies cannot be found either at Selberan or SPS, including the photocopy which Tan Keng Aun made and brought back to Kuala Lumpur following his annual stock-check on 10 July 1987.
 23.I should also at this juncture mention that on 1 October 1987, Tan Keng Aun made a check of the stock in Singapore as part of the investigation in the disciplinary inquiry against Khong. He said that he saw a photocopy of the MDO for the 141 pieces in the SPS safe. It was therefore suggested that the photocopy must be around somewhere at SPS and that SPS did not carry out a thorough search. All I wish to say is this. Khong claimed that he had not visited Singapore from 1 to 11 October 1987. He produced his international passport. But he had a restricted passport which he did not produce. He said his restricted passport was only valid for six months. But Chong produced his restricted passport which shows that it was valid for five years. Khong has not satisfactorily proven that he had not visited Singapore from 1 to 11 October 1987. No reason was given why Khong`s restricted passport had only a validity period of six months. As mentioned before, Khong had free access to the SPS safe.
 24.In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Khong stated that - 
I remember that I did call Steven Lai a couple of times sometime 
 in end 1987 to early 1988
, the exact dates of which I cannot recall, to ask if he had finished verifying and checking the MDOs, with the jewellery. He said no. I remember him saying that they were busy and that they needed more time to do their checking.
 But the evidence before me shows quite clearly that he never called Lai. And if he did call Lai, he surely could not be so naive or gullible to accept the excuse that PLJ did not have the time from 31 July 1987 to check. Why then did he not pursue the matter more vigorously or inform Chong?
 25.Another intriguing fact is this. From December 1987 to June 1988 Khong was `assisting` Selberan to search for copies/photocopies of the MDO and the acknowledged copy. On 22 December 1987 he came to the office of Selberan to help in the search. Khong never mentioned that the three copies of the MDO had been given back to Lai, not until 9 June 1988. This was in spite of the fact that on 23 May 1988 Chong wrote a letter to Khong (AB119) wherein Chong complained about Khong`s non-cooperation in Selberan`s efforts to recover the 141 pieces. The following portion of the letter is pertinent: 
You have since left without handing over or transferring into our custody and control the aforesaid proof of your purported delivery entrusted to you consisting of the second copy of the MDO to us at Selberan, and the third and fourth copies thereof to be left in the office of SPS according to standard practice to enable us to support our invoice for the goods you gave consigned to Peter Lai Jewellery Pte Ltd as our employee
 
As these documents relating to the abovecaptioned goods were entrusted to you and have not been traceable by us both here and in Singapore since your departure, we now require your immediate production of the same
 The letter even ended with a threat of appropriate action. It was handed personally by Chong to Khong who after reading it left it behind saying he did not want to see it. Why was it that Khong did not take that opportunity to tell Chong that the three copies of the MDO had been given to PLJ. He cannot claim that he did not think of that. It was only on 9 June 1988 that Khong mentioned for the first time (PB3) that the three copies had been given to Lai. Was that an afterthought?
 26.
 Conduct
Counsel for Khong submitted that Khong had cooperated fully with Selberan to get the 141 pieces back or obtain payment of the same from PLJ. He asked whether a person who had allegedly stolen the goods would return and help his employer look for documents (after he had left employment) on 22 December 1987 (before the denial of Lai) and keep in constant touch with Selberan until 1992 even though Khong owed them no such duty. I would observe that the evidence shows that he only turned up on 22 December 1987 after much persuasion on Selberan`s part. Subsequent efforts by Selberan to contact him also proved to be difficult.
 27.I do not wish to go into the legal argument whether Khong, though no longer in the employment of Selberan, was nevertheless under a duty to assist his former employer. Suffice it for me to say that it would be in Khong`s personal interest to assist Selberan to recover either the price of the goods or the goods, as he could be held personally answerable for the loss. It was clearly Khong`s responsibility to account for the 141 pieces and to show that they were in fact consigned to PLJ.
 28.There is, morever, something peculiar about the attitude of Khong. When asked to go and confront Lai, Khong insisted that all those staff of Selberan who saw the photocopies of the MDO and the acknowledged letter should affirm statutory declarations to that effect before he would go with Chong to confront Lai. He said he took that stand on the advice of solicitors. His lawyer advised that otherwise it would be his word against Lai`s word. But why should the making of those statutory declarations be made a condition precedent to Khong confronting Lai. That is baffling. He was effectively being accused of cheating. If Khong really believes in the truth of his own case he must have the conviction to face Lai openly, irrespective of whether other people will put in writing and on oath that they had seen photocopies of the MDO as well as the acknowledged copy. In fact, as far as I can see such sworn statements by others, who are not directly involved in the transaction, are not really relevant and can have very little weight. They could not testify whether the signature on the MDO or the acknowledged copy was really that of Lai or anyone from PLJ. What they had seen could very well be a fake or a photocopy of a fake. Thus their sworn statements could not really have assisted Khong in his direct confrontation with Lai. The clear impression I formed is that Khong was reluctant to confront Lai.
 29.There is another strange aspect on the part of Khong as reflected in a letter dated 21 July 1988 (AB61) written by a director of Selberan, Mr Yong Poh Kon, to Khong. It is necessary for me to set it out in full: 
You will recall our meeting on 9 June 1988 at the end of which you wrote me a written statement witnessed by Mr Chong Hong Chong, a copy of which is attached for your ease of reference.
 
At your request, I have approved a reduction of the net price, particulars of which are specifically set out in Mr Chong`s memo to me dated 17 June 1988, the contents of which were explained to you by Mr Chong on 23 June 1988.
 
As your accountability for this transaction remains unsettled after this long period of time, I now require your immediate action to return the relevant MDO which you removed from our custody without our authority in favour of Mr Lai or to settle the price for the 141 pieces of jewellery reflected in our SPS invoice No PFS/0761/87 for the sum of S$43,688.30. After the special reduction the amount payable is S$42,312.
 
Your other request on behalf of Mr Lai for an amended statement of accounts and an amended invoice would only serve to confuse rather than solve the issue between you and him.
 
I will instruct the accountant to issue a certified copy of the invoice to Mr Lai to regularise his record, if it is necessary in exchange for full and final payment of our invoice No PFS/0761/87.
 
I hope to hear from you soon.
 30.Khong appears to have conveyed a request from Lai for an amended statement of accounts to incorporate a special reduction to be given by Selberan. The evidence shows that Khong had never contacted Lai. Yet Khong asked for a reduction in price. Why? Furthermore, Khong never responded to this letter.
 31.Khong`s counsel made much of the fact that while PLJ denied receiving the 141 pieces their denial was not unequivocal as they also asked SPS to substantiate their claim with documentary proof. He asserted that PLJ asked for documents because Lai knew that Khong had returned all three copies of the MDO to Lai and would not be able to produce any; this was Lai`s ploy to see how Khong/Selberan would be able to prove that the 141 pieces had been given to PLJ. To quote the words of Khong`s counsel: 
By 11 October 1987 Lai clearly knew that the first defendant had left the plaintiff`s employment. He was then holding onto all original four copies of the MDO. He was obviously given the temptation to say that he never received the goods and to see what was Selberan/SPS` response.
 32.It seems to me quite natural for someone who is accused (if wrongly) of receiving something to ask for proof. I do not think it follows from this that the denial is not unequivocal. If that was indeed Lai`s intention, wouldn`t the acknowledged copy have undermined that ploy, unless the acknowledged copy is itself a fake. There is nothing to suggest that Lai knew that the acknowledged copy had disappeared from Selberan`s file.
 33.
 Did second defendant change position
Khong alleged that for some eight years, from December 1987 to 1995, PLJ maintained that they did not receive the 141 pieces. Then there was a change of position when PLJ filed their amended defence in early 1995. I do not think that is quite correct. In December 1987 Selberan, through SPS, gave an invoice to PLJ in relation to 141 pieces of jewellery. This was immediately disputed by PLJ who denied receiving them. Nothing was heard thereafter for a year. Then in early February 1989 PLJ received an invoice from SPS for the same sum of $43,688.30. On 22 February 1989 the management consultants of PLJ (IA Management Consultants Pte Ltd) replied restating the position, pointing out the error and asking SPS to investigate further. Later, in April 1989 solicitors stepped into the picture and PLJ`s stand remained unchanged. Nothing was heard from Selberan from then until 31 December 1993, a period of more than four and a half years, when Selberan served the present writ on PLJ. On 17 January 1994 PLJ filed its defence. Nothing happened until October 1994 when Khong`s solicitors applied for a stay on ground of 
 forum non conveniens 
 and also for striking out on the ground of limitation. It was from an affidavit filed on behalf of Khong that PLJ noted that there was an MDO allegedly signed by PLJ in relation to the 141 pieces. PLJ asked for a copy of the MDO but the solicitors for Khong could not furnish any and instead stated that the three copies of the MDO had been given to PLJ. PLJ then investigated into the matter. On 23 January 1995, before any discovery was obtained, PLJ amended their defence to allude to the consignment of 200 pieces which had been taken back by Khong. I do not think PLJ can really be accused of having changed their position.
 34.A related contention is, why didn`t Lai in his telex of 24 December 1987 also say that there was indeed a consignment of 200 pieces, that he purchased a few and the rest were returned? Why did Lai only say that he did not receive the 141 pieces. Here again, I do not see why a person who is wrongly accused of receiving 141 pieces should, in denying receipt of them avert to another consignment of a different quantity - 200. It would have been different if Khong/Selberan/SPS had mentioned to PLJ that the 141-piece consignment originated from the 200-piece consignment.
 35.
 My findings
In the light of the foregoing, and having weighed the probabilities on the points discussed above I find that the claim of Khong that the three copies of the MDO had been returned to Lai, and thus to PLJ, was something conjured up by Khong to cover up the conversion by him. I also find that the signature and stamp appearing on the acknowledged copy were probably created by him for the same purpose. He made no effort to ensure that the letter was properly acknowledged by PLJ. Neither did Khong raise it with Lai at the time he allegedly returned the three copies of the MDO to Lai (pursuant to Lai`s request) on 31 July 1987. That explains why after Khong left Selberan, the latter could not find the acknowledged copy or the copies/photocopies of the MDO. I cannot visualize why anyone would remove the acknowledged copy from the file of Selberan other than Khong himself. In fact it has not been suggested that someone else removed it deliberately. Accordingly, I also hold that the copies of the MDO which Tan Keng Aun saw on 10 July 1997 on his annual stock-check were not genuine. I am conscious that my findings herein amounted to imputing fraud to Khong and that for such a finding a higher standard of probabilities must be shown. I have borne this in mind in coming to my findings.
 36.
 Proper party
Apart from the substantive question, Khong and PLJ have also raised two common technical defences. The first is that Selberan is not the proper party to sue in this action as the documentation shows that the contract of consignment was between SPS and PLJ. They contend that Selberan has no locus standi to commence proceedings; it should have been SPS.
 37.In the light of my findings above that it was Khong who had converted the 141 pieces, this point, in so far as Khong is concerned, is without merits. Khong was entrusted with the goods by his employer, Selberan. He should account for the same and if he could not, he is clearly to be responsible to Selberan. In his words `I did not account to anyone in SPS. I reported to Chong at the plaintiff.`
 38.Another basis upon which Khong`s counsel sought to argue is that because Selberan billed SPS for the 141 pieces on 4 December 1987 and SPS in turn billed PLJ, the property in the goods had passed to SPS and thus SPS should be the party to sue. Selberan had ceased to be the owner and could not sue. There are two answers to this point. First, on the evidence I find that as between Selberan and SPS it was never intended that property in the goods would pass. It was done in this manner for accounting and tax reasons. The parties did not envisage that any property should pass from Selberan to SPS. When the customer pays for it, property would pass from Selberan to the customer. Second, the invoice of 4 December 1987 was issued on the assumption that the goods were duly consigned and taken by PLJ. I do not see how it can be argued that property passed from Selberan to SPS (even if that were intended) when Khong had surreptiously converted them well before any invoice was issued.
 39.If I had found against PLJ on conversion, the arguments of PLJ on this point would also be without merits. Even though the documentation used by Khong to consign the goods was that of SPS, I find that Lai, and thus PLJ, knew all along that it was a matter of arrangement between Selberan and SPS and that SPS was really an agent in relation to the transaction. While Selberan invoiced SPS on 4 December 1987 and SPS in turn invoiced PLJ, Lai knew all along that the principal party was Selberan. This was not the first transaction between Selberan and PLJ; they had a history of dealings with each other. Lai also knew that Khong was from Selberan and the goods all bore the Selberan mark. SPS merely reproduced the invoice issued by Selberan without any mark-up. What better proof can there be of the understanding than this: when the Peter Lai group was celebrating its 20th anniversary in November 1986 and the opening of a new branch of PLJ at Wisma Atria, Orchard Road, they invited Selberan to participate in a special supplement of the 
 Straits Times 
. There is no evidence that Peter Lai group invited SPS to participate in that special supplement. If Selberan had no trading relationship with PLJ, the invitation would not have gone to Selberan. I would add that I find Lai`s evidence on his understanding of the arrangements between Selberan and SPS to be wholly unsatisfactory; at times he was being evasive, admitting less than what he really knew.
 40.
 Limitation
The second point raised concerned limitation. Khong`s submission was that as the action was only commenced on 15 December 1993, it is time-barred. It is not disputed that as at end October 1987 Selberan knew that the acknowledged copy in the file was missing, and so was the photocopy of the MDO. Chong then enlisted his staff to locate the documents. He also contacted Chew, the accountant with SPS, to look for the copies of the MDO. Chew failed to find any. However, Tan Keng Aun in his evidence said that on 1 October 1987 when he came down to Singapore to make a stock-check in relation to the disciplinary inquiry against Khong, he did see a photocopy of the MDO in the safe of SPS. Khong submitted that, therefore, the search carried out by Chew of SPS could not have been exhaustive. Khong also argued that the delivery of the 141 pieces to PLJ could be proved by other means, such as the stocklist and what Chong and Khong knew.
 41.Oridinarily to determine limitation, it is necessary to establish when did the cause of action against Khong for conversion accrue to Selberan. Khong`s counsel argued it was on 1 October 1987 when Tan Keng Aun was in Singapore to ascertain the stock position as part of the disciplinary inquiry which was then in progress against Khong. In the alternative, it was in early November 1987 when Chong called Chew of SPS to check for documents. Chong could also have contacted Lai at the time.
 42.As I see it, on the facts of the present case, the real question is whether there has been any fraudulent misrepresentation on the part of Khong to stop time from running against Selberan. Counsel for Khong submitted that for Selberan to rely on s 29 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163), fraud must be an essential ingredient of the cause of action. It is necessary to note what s 29(1)(a) and (b) provides: 
29(1) Where, in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by this Act -
 
(a) the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant or his agent or of any person through whom he claims or his agent; 
(b) the right of action is concealed by the fraud of any such person as aforesaid; or 
(c) (irrelevant)
 
the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud or the mistake, as the case may be, or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.
 While fraud must be an essential ingredient in relation to s 29(1)(a) it is not so in relation to s 29(1)(b). It is settled law that conversion is not an action based on fraud: see 
Beaman v ARTS Ltd
 
[1949] 1 KB 550
. Of course in the particular situation of a case, the conversion could well involve fraud. But for the purpose of s 29(1)(b), the fraud is in relation to the concealment, not the cause of action.
 43.In the light of my finding above that the 141 pieces were never consigned to PLJ, and that the alleged MDO and the acknowledged letter were fakes, there is clearly fraudulent concealment on the part of Khong as to the conversion. Selberan was acting under the belief that they had been consigned to PLJ and thus were looking feverishly for documents evidencing the consignment, which Khong had surreptitiously removed from the premises of Selberan. But Chong did not suspect Khong, for even as late as 12 November 1987 Chong gave a testimony to Khong. He obviously thought that the missing documents could have been misplaced. Selberan did not know that the 141 pieces were not consigned to PLJ until the latter rejected the invoice raised by SPS on 24 December 1987 and stated that it never received the 141 pieces on consignment. In my opinion s 29(1)(b) applies and time did not run against Selberan until 24 December 1987 when PLJ denied receiving the consignment. That was the day the fraudulent concealment of the conversion was exposed.
 44.
 Estoppel
There is a third technical point raised by Khong. It is estoppel. It was put in this way. On 29 September 1987 there was the disciplinary inquiry against Khong for some missing jewellery items (nothing to do with the 141 pieces). The inquiry found that items amounting to M$5256.29 were unaccounted for and Khong was asked to make good the same. As a compromise, Selberan accepted 50% payment by Khong (of M$2628.15) in settlement of those missing items. Khong averred that both he and Selberan considered the matter of unaccounted jewellery items from the safe at SPS as on the day he ceased work at Selberan (12 October 1987), to be settled. The defence of estoppel was based on that.
 45.In my judgment this defence has no merit at all. The inquiry touched on some other items of jewellery. At that point in time the 141 pieces were not unaccounted for. Selberan believed, based on the photocopy of the MDO and the acknowledged letter, that the 141 pieces had been consigned to PLJ. There was no question of the payment of M$2628.15 being payment in settlement of the 141 pieces as well. The 141 pieces were not an issue at that point in time. The 141 pieces only became unaccounted for on 24 December 1987 when PLJ denied having the 141 pieces on consignment.
 46.
 Judgment
In the result I hold that the first defendant has converted the 141 pieces and the plaintiffs shall have judgment against the first defendant for the sum of $43,688.30 and costs. The judgment sum shall bear interest at 6% from the date the writ was served on the first defendant. The plaintiffs` claim against the second defendant is dismissed with costs (without any getting up on the point of proper party). The plaintiffs` costs shall include the costs the plaintiffs shall have to pay the second defendant.",1998-02-02 00:00:00,SG High Court

LEE SEIU KIN JC
 The plaintiff is, and was at all material times, a member of the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) and a licensed dealer under the Securities Industry Act (Cap 289). The defendant was at all material times a customer of the plaintiff who traded in shares through the plaintiff.
 2.The plaintiff claims that the defendant failed to pay for shares that she had instructed them to purchase on her behalf. This had resulted in the plaintiff incurring losses in the consequential forced sale of those shares. In this suit, the plaintiff sought to recover such losses, with interest, from the defendant. At the end of the trial on 5 December 1997, I gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff as follows: (i). the sum of $136,132.03 with interest at 6% from 12 July 1994;
 (ii). the sum of $1,682,155.10 with interest at 6% from 12 July 1994;
 (iii). the sum of $581,611.12 with interest of $9,752.23 and further interest at 3.5% above the OCBC prime rate from 17 August 1994;
 (iv). the sum of $989,126.67 with interest of $6,813.41 and further interest at 3.5% above the OCBC prime rate from 17 August 1994; and
 (v). costs.
 The defendant has appealed and I now give my grounds of decision.
 3.The defendant is, and was at all material times, a property agent with `Tahiti Home Enterprises`, a business she started in 1981. She was also a director of the following companies at various periods: (1). Pan Field Lines Pte Ltd, from 1976 to 1987;
 (2). San Raku (S) Pte Ltd, from 1981 to 1983;
 (3). Pitmac (SEA) Pte Ltd;
 (4). Seadon Trading Pte Ltd, from 1985 to 1986;
 (5). Joseph Ng Management Consultants (S) Pte Ltd, from 1986 to 1988;
 (6). Gesterin Trading Pte Ltd, from 1986 to 1991.
 4.In addition, the plaintiff produced a copy of the Registry of Companies and Businesses - People`s Profile Information (PPI) which showed that she was also a director of the following companies: (1). Careers by Design Pte Ltd, from January to December 1986;
 (2). JBM Investments Pte Ltd, from March to April 1986; and
 (3). Motif Auto Pte Ltd, from 1993 to 1994.
 The defendant was unable to recall whether she had been a director of these companies. But her counsel, Mr Yap Teong Liang, agreed to the admission of the PPI document, which also showed that she had been the owner or manager of four other businesses which have since been deregistered.
 5.
 The contract between the parties
The first issue that I had to decide was the terms of the contract between the parties. According to the plaintiff`s credit manager, PW2, the defendant traded under four accounts as follows: (i). account no 10006/01, opened on or about 4 July 1989;
 (ii). account no 10978/01, opened on or about 26 November 1992;
 (iii). account no 39931/39, opened on or about 27 October 1993; and
 (iv). account no 44521/39, opened on or about 9 December 1993.
 The first two accounts, with the number `01` at the end, were serviced by Ho Seng Hock (PW1), a director of the plaintiff who also acted as a dealer`s representative. The last two accounts, with the number `39` at the end, were serviced by one Yap Eng Piow, a remisier with the plaintiff at the material time.
 6.The defendant signed account opening forms in respect of only two of these accounts, viz. No 10006/01 (BA318) and no 39931/39 (BA320-321). The other two accounts were created by the plaintiff to facilitate trading through share margin trading accounts (SMTA) that the defendant opened with Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd (OCBC Bank). According to the PW2, when a customer opened a SMTA with OCBC Bank, the bank would advise the plaintiff of this whereupon the plaintiff would create a separate account. The customer`s trades financed by the bank would be booked into this new account, which was loosely called a `margin account`. No credit is extended by the plaintiff to the customer under this margin account. When a customer buys shares which he intends to be financed by his SMTA with OCBC Bank, the plaintiff would deliver these shares to the bank for acceptance and payment. Similarly if the shares are sold, payment is made to the bank. If the bank refuses to accept the shares for whatever reason, eg if the credit limit has been reached, the customer would have to pay for them from some other source.
 7.The trading account no 10006/01, serviced by PW1, was opened in 1989. In 1992, the defendant applied to OCBC Bank to open a SMTA. Upon receiving notification of the creation of the SMTA for the defendant, the plaintiff then created account no 10978/01 for the purpose of booking the defendant`s trades financed by the SMTA and serviced by PW1. The trading account no 39931/39, serviced by Yap Eng Piow, was opened sometime in October 1993. On or about 9 December 1993 the plaintiff opened account no.44521/39 for the purpose of booking the defendant`s trades financed by the SMTA and serviced by Yap Eng Piow. The documents relating to the creation of these two accounts are found in BA319 (for account no 10978/01) and BA 323 (for account no.44521/39). These are internal documents of the plaintiff which the defendant had never seen before. I find that the creation of these 2 accounts is an internal procedure of the plaintiff and has no effect on the contractual relationship between the parties. This relationship is governed by the documents associated with the opening of the two accounts for which she had signed on the documents, ie: (i). in relation to account no 10978/01, it is governed by the terms of account no 10006/01, opened pursuant to application dated 4 July 1989 (BA318); and
 (ii). in relation to account no 44521/39, it is governed by the terms of account no 39931/39, opened pursuant to application dated 26 November 1993 (BA320),
 as well as by the practices and customs of the trade and any implied terms.
 8.It is common ground that in respect of account no 10006/01, there are no terms and conditions annexed to the application form (BA318), unlike the application form in respect of account no 39931/39 (BA320) where the terms and conditions are printed on the reverse (BA321). In the latter form, BA320, there is the following statement: 
I/We the abovenamed person(s) (the `customer`) request that you open account for me/us for the trading of stocks and shares with and through OCBC Securities Private Limited (the `company`) on the terms set out in the reverse side of this application form which terms I/we confirm having read and understood.
 There is no similar statement in the first form, BA318. I conclude therefore that the terms printed on the reverse of the form in respect of account no 39931/39 do not apply as express terms of contract to account no 10006/01.
 9.However this does not preclude some of those terms, or a modification thereof, from being applicable by implication, having regard to the customs and practices of the trade. The parties agree that the contract between them is governed by the applicable rules and bye-laws of the SES. The duties and conditions imposed on the plaintiff by such bye-laws constitute, in part or in whole, the basis for implying certain terms. I find that the following are, inter alia, the implied terms of the contract between the parties: (i). the plaintiff has a duty to act in the interests of the defendant (see bye-law VI cl 2);
 (ii). the plaintiff is to act only on the instructions of the defendant, including oral instructions, unless the defendant had given plaintiff discretionary powers of investment (see bye-law VI cl 2); and
 (iii). the defendant is to pay for her purchases, or the net differences of her purchases and sales, within a certain period, failing which the plaintiff is entitled to sell those shares and recover any losses from her (see bye-law II cl 7(a).
 10.For account no 39931/39, additional terms of the contract are contained in the terms and conditions printed on the reverse of the account opening form (BA321) and these state, inter alia: 
3 Interest at the rate of 3.5% over the OCBC Bank`s prime lending rate per annum shall be paid on all moneys due and payable by the customer to the company. 
5 No dealer`s representative (whether dealer or remisier) has authority to waive or adversely affect the company`s rights under these terms or to create any liability on the company`s part under these terms and where the dealer`s representative whose name appears above is a remisier, that such dealer`s representative is appointed by the customer to act on his behalf and is neither the company`s servant nor the company`s employee and all instructions of purchase or sale given by such dealer`s representative if given or purportedly given on the customer`s behalf shall be deemed to be instructions given by the customer on which the company can act in accordance with and look to the customer for responsibility thereof whether or not such dealer`s representative is also jointly, severally or distinctly liable.
 11.Therefore any late payment under account no 39931/39 attracts a contractual interest of 3.5% above the OCBC prime rate per annum. The plaintiff contends that this also applies in respect of account no 10006/01. However there is no such term in the account opening form. Mr Yap submits that these terms apply only in respect of account no 39931/39 and not to the other accounts. I accept this submission in relation to account nos 10006/01 and 10978/01 and find that no such term exists in respect of those accounts. On the view that I have taken that transactions under account no 44521/39 are governed by the terms of account no 39931/39, the terms above would govern the transactions in account no 44521/39.
 12.In her evidence-in-chief, the defendant said that she did not read the terms and conditions printed on the back of the account opening form for account no 39931/39, ie BA321. She claimed that these terms were not shown and explained to her at all. However she did not offer evidence of any special circumstances in her case that would entitle her to the plea of non est factum. Indeed given the fact that she had, since 1976, been appointed as directors of various companies and had, since 1981 incorporated and managed her own property business, it is not surprising that she was unable to do so. Accordingly, on the authority of 
Saunders v Anglia Building Society
 
[1970] 3 All ER 961
, she is precluded from denying that those terms had been incorporated in the contract.
 13.
 The plaintiff`s claim
The plaintiff claims that the defendant instructed PW1 and Yap Eng Piow separately to buy certain shares, mostly Malaysian counters, over the period between late 1993 and early 1994. Unfortunately, on 12 January 1994 the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) counters took a severe beating due to certain events and the prices of the defendant`s shares plunged. The defendant was unable to pay for these positions on the due dates and the plaintiff sold them off at a loss and sought to recover these losses, with interest, in this action. It is not necessary for me to set out in detail the name, quantity and prices of these shares as Mr Yap did not challenge the quantum of the losses incurred by their sale. Neither did he dispute the plaintiff`s computation of interest on the losses. The dispute hinges purely on liability. The amounts claimed by the plaintiff under the various accounts and the interest claims are as follows:
 
10006/01
$ 136,132.03
$ 3,509.92
10978/01
$1,682,155.10
$42,115.05
39931/39
$ 581,611.12
$ 9,752.23
44521/39
$ 989,126.67
$ 6,813.41
Total
$3,389,024.92
$62,190.61
 14.In addition, the plaintiff claims interest at the contractual rate from 17 August 1994 to the date of judgment.
 15.
 The defence
The defence rests on two main planks, ie: (i). The plaintiff had breached various provisions of the SES bye-laws and thereby is not entitled to be paid or indemnified by the defendant in respect of its losses.
 (ii). The plaintiff, through Ho Seng Hock (PW1) and Yap Eng Piow, had rendered negligent advice to the defendant in reliance of which she entered into the transactions that resulted in the losses.
 (i) Breach of SES bye-laws
 16.Mr Yap submits that the plaintiff had breached the following SES bye-laws: (i). bye-law III, cll 1, 2, 7, 8 and 16(g); and
 (ii). bye-law VI, cll 2, 3 and 7.
 17.I first examine the question of the consequences of such breaches, ie whether the defendant`s liability to the plaintiff is extinguished by the plaintiff`s commission of such breaches. I should add that it is pleaded in the defence that the plaintiff had breached various provisions of the Securities Industry Act and Regulations as well. But these have not been taken up by Mr Yap in his submissions.
 18.The SES is a company limited by shares incorporated under the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Ed). Articles 112.1 and 113 of its articles of association provide for the making of rules and bye-laws and state as follows: 
Rules 
112.1 The company has, from time to time, the power to make, vary and repeal rules, consistent with these articles relating to the management and control of the Stock Exchange, its member companies and to the relationships that may exist as between the member companies, the Exchange and non-members and for matters connected with the stock trade generally.
 
Bye-Laws 
113 The company may make, vary and repeal bye-laws as to the mode and conditions on and subject to which business on the exchange should be conducted and to the conduct of persons transacting those business.
 19.It can be seen that the bye-laws are made for the purpose of regulating (a) the mode and conditions under which business on the Exchange should be conducted; and (b) the conduct of persons transacting those business. Given the nature of these bye-laws, they can only bind the members of the SES - see 
Chong Theresa v Kin Khoon & Co
 
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 253
 . There are nine bye-laws, namely: Bye-law I:. Definitions
 Bye-law II:. Trading & Settlement
 Bye-law III:. Financial, Accounting and Conduct of Business Requirements
 Bye-law IV:. Trading Floor
 Bye-law V:. Dealer`s Representatives
 Bye-law VI:. Code of Conduct for Dealers in Securities
 Bye-law VII:. Advertising
 Bye-law VIII:. Trading on SESDAQ Securities
 Bye-law IX:. NASD-SES Market Linkage
 20.Bye-law II specifies the securities that members may deal in and rates of brokerage, and sets out the conditions and procedure for delivery of securities and settlement. Bye-law III obliges every member company to adhere to the principles of good business practice and to ensure that its staff comply with the SES rules and bye-laws. It sets out the manner in which clients` accounts are to be opened and their transactions dealt with. This bye-law also deals with how margin accounts are to be operated and the extent of collateral that the member company should obtain from the client. There are provisions dealing with how much exposure the member company may have in relation to a single client and to a single security. It also sets out the requirements for accounting records. Bye-law IV relates to the procedure on the trading floor. Bye-law V sets out the requirements for and conditions of engagement of dealers` representatives. Bye-law VI sets out the `standards of ethical behaviour to be followed by dealers` representatives`. Bye-law VII stipulates the manner in which member companies may advertise their services. Bye-law VIII relates to trading on SESDAQ, the second board of the SES. And bye-law IX relates to trading on NASD securities.
 21.I turn now to the specific bye-laws that the defendant alleges the plaintiff had breached. Bye-law III cl 1 states: 
Business Practices
 
Every member company shall at all times adhere to the principles of good business practices in the conduct of its business affairs.
 Clause 2: 
Compliance by Personnel
 
Every member company shall ensure that all its employees, directors, officers and remisiers comply with Exchange`s rules, bye-laws and requirements.
 Clause 7: 
Client Accounts 
(a) Opening of individual client accounts
 
Every member company is required through a designated director or officer reporting to the director to: 
(1) use due diligence to learn the essential facts relative to every client, every order, every cash or margin account accepted or carried by the member company and every person holding power of attorney over any account accepted or carried by the member company; 
(2) diligently supervise all accounts handled by its dealers` representatives; 
(3) specifically approve the opening of an account prior to or promptly after the completion of any transaction for the account of or with a client. The designated director or officer approving the opening of the account shall, prior to giving his approval, be personally informed as to the essential facts relative to the client and to the nature of the proposed account and shall indicate his approval in writing on a document which shall become part of the permanent records of the member company.
 Clause 8: 
Client`s Particulars
 
All essential particulars relative to every client shall be recorded and maintained up to date at the office of the member company. Such particulars shall include the identity card/passport numbers, residential address and telephone numbers, occupation and name and address of the employer.
 Clause 16(g): 
Margin Account 
(a) A member company may extend credit facilities to approved clients for securities transactions subject to the margin account requirements of this section. 
(b) Margin account arrangements must be evidenced in the form of a written agreement executed between the member company and the client. 
 
(g) The member company shall cause daily review to be made of all margin accounts to ensure that credit is not over-extended beyond the approved facility and that the margin requirements prescribed above are met at all times. For the purpose of computing margin requirements in a margin account, the last done price of the security on the preceding market day shall be used. All transactions done on the same day shall be combined on a transaction date basis and the total cost of purchase or the net proceeds of sale including any commission charged and other expenses shall be taken into account for computing margin requirements.
 Bye-law IV cl 2 states: 
Acting as Agent
 
A dealer`s representative when acting as agent must carry out his client`s instructions and must exercise such skill, care and diligence as is usual or necessary for the proper conduct of the business. He must at all times act in good faith and in the best interests of the client and must make full disclosure to the client of all material circumstances and interests
 Clause 3: 
A dealer`s representative should not encourage sales or purchases with the sole object of generating commission.
 Clause 7: 
A dealer`s representative should keep, in respect of each client whose investments he is managing, sufficient records to enable the dealer`s representative at any time without undue delay to establish the client`s precise cash and investment position.
 22.Mr Yap seems to say that because the plaintiff had breached those bye-laws, the defendant is not liable to pay for the losses in question. However he does not explain how this consequence comes about. Paragraph 4 of the defence alludes to `public policy` but this is not developed at all in the closing submissions of counsel. What he did say in his submissions were the following points: (a). The plaintiff did not have the records required to be kept under bye-law VI cl 7. Had they complied with this requirement, `it would have been obvious that even prior to January 1994, the defendant`s trades were large. The plaintiffs should have found out more about the defendant then.`
 (b). In view of the market plunge on 11 January 1994, the plaintiff `ought to have been more vigilant in supervising the defendant`s accounts The risk of the defendant in not being able to pay for the shares given the large trades [from 11 to 14 January 1994] must have been foremost in the plaintiffs` mind. The reason for this is that if the defendant could not pick up the shares, the plaintiffs would have to pay for the shares.`
 23.My Yap contended that there was a general duty to ensure that the client did not overextend herself. With respect, I cannot see how the bye-laws could establish such a duty on the part of the plaintiff to a person of full age and sound mind such as the defendant. A, in dealing with B in a commercial situation, may extend credit to B if he considers that B is good for a certain sum. But having extended it, if A finds that B is unable to repay A has to face the consequences of his mistake. If A considers litigation worthwhile he proceeds with a suit to recover the sum owed and obtains and enforces judgment against B. If B does not have the assets to satisfy the judgment then A will have to write off the shortfall. A cannot be precluded from suing B for the debt because he had misjudged the credit-worthiness of B.
 24.In the case of a member company of the SES, it is required under the bye-laws to carry out certain acts. Hence bye-law III cl 7(a) states that it must use due diligence to learn the essential facts relative to every client and cl 8 requires it to record particulars of the client which shall include identity card/passport numbers, residential address, telephone number, occupation and name and address of employer. These are duties owed to the SES and not to the client. Although there is no evidence from the SES as to the purpose of these clauses, presumably obtaining such information will, inter alia, enable the member company to detect and avoid fraud by the client. I cannot see how these requirements are necessary for the protection of the client. The position is clearer upon an examination of cl 16(g). This requires the member company to make a daily review of all margin accounts to ensure that credit is not over-extended and that prescribed margin requirements are met. This is for the protection of the member company, and by extension, the SES. Not the client. Indeed a client may be happy if his stockbroker extends more credit to him than his circumstances would permit. This would enable him to take on more positions and thereby he stands to make a higher profit should the market move in his favour. If he makes a loss it is the stockbroker who is left to bear the losses if he is unable to pay his debts. It is important to bear in mind that it is the client who instructs the broker to buy or sell shares; he need not make use of the credit extended to him if he does not want to.
 25.In relation to bye-law VI cl 2 which sets out the duty to exercise the necessary skill, care and diligence and to act in good faith and in the client`s interest, and to cl 3 which states that a dealer`s representative should not encourage transactions with the sole object of generating commission, I would agree that such duties are incorporated into the contract between the plaintiff and defendant.
 26.I find that cl 7 of bye-law VI does not apply in respect of the defendant. It applies only to a client whose investments are managed by the dealer`s representative, which is not the case in respect of the defendant. Indeed the defendant`s position is that PW1 and Yap Eng Piow gave her recommendations and she gave her approval. There is no allegation from her that they were managing her investments. The situation is clearer when one looks at the preceding cl 6 which states: 
A member company or a dealer`s representative who undertakes to manage the investments of a client (whether or not on a discretionary basis) should set out in writing his terms and conditions. This should include the following: 
(a) The scope of the discretion and investment objectives. 
(b) The fees to be charged for management and the basis on which they are calculated. 
(c) Arrangements for the custody of securities and cash. 
(d) Any arrangements for the payment of interest on uninvested balances. 
(e) Arrangements for reporting and valuations.
 There is no suggestion of such an arrangement and, it is clear that the PW1 and Yap Eng Piow were not managing the defendant`s investments. I have no doubt that it would startle everyone familiar with the industry if I held that dealers and remisiers were obliged to keep, in respect of their ordinary clients, such records as would enable them to know without delay their precise cash and investment position.
 27.Therefore it is my view that, apart from cll 2 and 3 of bye-law VI, the provisions in the bye-laws cited do not relate to duties owed by the plaintiff to the defendant. Indeed if the defendant`s proposition that mere breach of such bye-laws could deprive the stockbroker of his right to recover the debt owed by a client is accepted, all a client who owes a debt to his stockbroker needs to do to absolve himself of the debt would be to find some breach by the stockbroker of the multitude of SES bye-laws.
 28.I turn to the question whether the plaintiff was in breach of cll 2 and 3 of bye-law VI. On the view that I have taken on the defendant`s allegations that the plaintiff had rendered negligent advice which will be dealt with below, and in the absence of any other evidence, I do not find that the plaintiff had failed to exercise such skill, care and diligence nor that it had not acted in good faith and in the interests of the defendant as would amount to a breach of cl 2.
 29.Clause 3 prohibits a dealer`s representative from encouraging transactions with the sole object of generating commission. Mr Yap contends that over 11 trading days in January 1994, her total buy and sell orders through all four accounts amounted to $13.262 million. This generated commissions for the plaintiff totalling $132,620. There was a further RM3.219m buy orders in respect of Malaysian shares, generating commissions totalling RM32,192. More than half of these transactions were done over the period 10 to 14 January. Mr Yap submits that this shows that the plaintiff was in breach of cl 3. However I do not see how the fact that the defendant had engaged in large transactions over a short period proves that the plaintiff`s dealer`s representative had encouraged those transactions with the sole object of generating commission. Obviously one of the objects of any dealer`s representative, if he should encourage a client to purchase or sell any securities, is to generate commission. That is his livelihood. A breach of cl 3 occurs only if he does it with this as the sole object. There is an element of subjective intention that has to be established and while it is possible to do it by way of circumstantial evidence, in my view the mere fact that large transactions were done over a short period falls far short of the evidence needed. I should add that PW1 had given evidence that the defendant carried out `contra trading`, ie that she sold her positions after a short period. At any time her total position outstanding would be much less than the aggregate of her transactions for the month.
 30.Accordingly, the plaintiff is not precluded from recovering the losses from the defendant, even if it has breached the provisions complained of, apart from cll 2 and 3 of bye-law VI.
 31.On the view that I have taken in respect of the consequences to the plaintiff of breaches of the other bye-laws (apart from cll 2 and 3 of bye-law VI), I would not have needed to consider whether they have in fact been breached. However, in case I should be wrong as to those consequences, I make the following findings of fact: (a). In relation to cl 1 of bye-law III, I find no evidence that the plaintiff had not adhered to the principles of good business practices in the conduct of its business affairs. The defendant`s counsel did not submit as to what these good business practices are. It is a very general duty and even if the plaintiff had committed various breaches of other bye-laws, it does not follow that the plaintiff is in breach of this clause.
 (b). In relation to cl 2 of bye-law III, on the view that I have taken below in respect of cl 8 of bye-law III, it would follow that the plaintiff had failed to ensure that all its employees, directors, officers and remisiers comply with the bye-laws and is, as a result, in breach of this clause.
 (c). In relation to cl 7(a)(1) of bye-law III, I find that the defendant had not proved that the plaintiff was in breach. The defendant had not established what are the `essential facts relative to each client`. Until that is established it is not possible to say that all such essential facts had not been obtained. I am aware that cl 8 requires recording of `all essential particulars relative to every client` and that these are stated to include identity card/passport number, address, telephone, occupation and employer. However the term used in cl 8 is `essential particulars` as opposed to `essential facts`. I am of the view that there is a material difference. Clause 8 deals with the particulars relating to the identity of the client and the means to locate or communicate with him, ie his residence and place of work and their telephone numbers. Clause 7 deals with the substantive aspects of the client`s standing, principally his credit worthiness. While some items in cl 8 are part of the essential facts in cl 7, eg occupation, others such as telephone numbers are not. PW1 had given evidence that he knew the defendant and the circles she moved in and had formed a view as to her credit-worthiness. In my view the defence had not proven that this fell short of the due diligence requirement in cl 7.
 (d). In relation to cl 7(a)(2) of bye-law III, I find that the defendant had not established that the plaintiff had failed to diligently supervise all the accounts concerned. The defendant has failed to establish that the practice of the plaintiff, particularly in conducting review of the defendant`s trades only once or twice in the week of 10 to 14 January 1994 shows that the plaintiff had lacked diligence in its supervision of all accounts.
 (e). In relation to cl 8 of bye-law III, the plaintiff had not obtained the residential address and telephone number of the defendant in respect of account no 10006/01 - see BA318, although this information was obtained when account no 39931/39 was opened four years later - see BA320. As the plaintiff did not adduce any evidence to the contrary, I find that the plaintiff had contravened cl 8 in relation to account no. 10006/01 from July 1989 when this account was opened until October 1993 when it obtained this information upon the opening of account no 39931/39.
 (f). In respect of cl 16(g) of bye-law III, I find that the accounts in question were not margin accounts and do not fall within this provision. The plaintiff did not extend any credit to the defendant; it was OCBC Bank that extended credit. While the bank had some arrangement with the plaintiff to facilitate transactions financed by the bank this hardly constitutes a margin account which is indirectly defined in cl 16(a) and under 16(b) requires to be `evidenced in the form of a written agreement`. I do not accept Mr Yap`s submission that they were margin accounts because `the characteristics of margin trading were prevalent`. A margin account is one whereby the plaintiff extends credit to the client - see cl 16(a). Apart from the normal settlement period, no credit is extended by the plaintiff. It is the bank which extends the credit and which undertakes the checks into the defendant`s background for assessment of her creditworthiness. Most importantly it is the bank that bears the losses should she fail to settle the amounts outstanding on her SMTA account. Clause 16 exists to regulate situations where SES member companies extend credit to their clients by way margin accounts in order to ensure that these members do not take on too much risk.
 (ii) Negligent advice
 32.The defendant claimed that PW1 and Yap Eng Piow gave her negligent advice in reliance of which she had purchased the securities the subject of this action. She claimed that PW1 and Yap were in competition between them to obtain her business. Typically, they would call her several times a day and recommend to her shares to buy or sell. She said that she always agreed with their recommendations because she believed that they knew much more about the share market than she did. She herself was confused with all the hectic activities and lost track of which shares were being bought or sold, her role being reduced to saying `yes` to their recommendations. When share prices plunged in early January 1994 and she had incurred substantial losses she did not know what to do. She asked PW1 and Yap Eng Piow for advice and they separately advised that she should buy even more shares to `average` down the prices so that when the market recovered she would be able to reduce her losses. She accepted this advice as she did not see a better alternative. She claimed that neither PW1 nor Yap told her of the risks of this course of action.
 33.PW1 denied that he had given her such advice. He said that the defendant had no need for advice from him because she moved in high business and financial circles, and in particular that she was the mistress of a person who was prominent in financial circles (which the defendant did not deny nor challenge). PW1 said that she generally appeared to be well-informed and had told him of her meetings with prominent Singaporean and Malaysian businessmen and her perception of their views on certain counters and on the market generally. PW1 cited an example where the defendant had informed him prior to the public announcement that PSC was going to issue bonus shares. He did not believe her at first, but the information turned out to be true and PSC had a bonus issue in 1994. PW1 said that the transactions he had executed on her behalf were done on her specific instructions and she told him that she had information that the prices of those counters would rise. From late 1993 through to mid-January 1994, the market was extremely busy and orders were incessantly coming in from his clients through the six telephone lines that he had. During that period he would not have the time to make recommendations even if he had wanted to. Moreover it wasnot in his nature to make recommendations to his clients because if prices should move contrary to his prediction, he would probably lose those clients.
 34.On consideration of the evidence before me and the demeanour of the defendant and PW1 in cross-examination, I find that PW1 did not render the advice as the defendant had claimed. I find PW1, who was cross-examined for almost one and a half days, to be a co-operative witness and his evidence was consistent and forthright. The defendant, on the other hand, was somewhat evasive in various parts of her evidence and she changed her position several times, as follows: (i). She had said in her affidavit evidence-in-chief (para 50) that neither PW1 nor Yap Eng Piow told her, in advising her in January 1994 to buy more shares to `average out` the price of the shares, about the risks that she could be facing. However, under cross-examination she agreed that there was some discussion with PW1 and with Yap Eng Piow about the risks she was taking in this respect.
 (ii). The defendant at first said that she did not receive confirmatory notes on transactions carried out by PW1 in respects of trades executed under her accounts with him until after January 1994. When confronted with a confirmatory note dated 11 January 1994, she changed her position and said that prior to that note, there was no confirmatory note from PW1.
 (iii). In her affidavit filed on 30 September 1994 in opposition to summary judgment proceedings, she deposed that she believed that Yap Eng Piow had made a mistake. Under cross-examination, she said that it should have been PW1 and that her solicitors did not correct that mistake in her affidavit.
 (iv). She was cross-examined on a bank deposit of US$110,000 she had in Hong Kong, which she explained was made because she had wanted to buy a property there at the time. When asked why she had deposited in US dollars (presumably instead of Hong Kong dollars), she at first said that as a foreigner she was not permitted to deposit it in any other currency in Hong Kong. Then she said that if she wanted an interest bearing account, it must be in US dollars. Finally she said that the bank officers had recommended her to put her money in US dollars.
 35.As regards the defendant`s allegation that Yap Eng Piow rendered advice to her, there was no direct evidence to the contrary offered by the plaintiff, who did not produce Yap Eng Piow to give evidence. The defendant`s evidence was that both Yap Eng Piow and PW1 rendered the same advice to her, thereby painting PW1 with the same brush as Yap Eng Piow. Given the finding I make in respect of PW1, and given the totality of the evidence before me including the background of the defendant as a businesswoman and the circle she moved in, I would hold that on balance, her version that Yap also made those recommendations cannot be believed.
 36.The next point is whether, even if the recommendations were made by either PW1 or Yap Eng Piow, she did rely on them and if she did, whether she can thereby avoid liability to the plaintiff. The defendant seems to say that the plaintiff is vicariously liable for the negligence of PW1 and Yap. In respect of PW1, by not making a submission on this, the plaintiff must be taken to have accepted that it is vicariously liable. In respect of Yap Eng Piow, the plaintiff submits that cl 5 of the conditions attached to the opening form (BA320) expressly states that a remisier (which Yap was) is the customer`s agent and is not the plaintiff`s servant or employee. PW2 gave evidence that Yap Eng Piow, as a remisier, was remunerated solely on the basis of commission on the volume of trade handled by him. This term of engagement is consistent with cl 5. On the view that I have taken that this clause applies in relation to the defendant`s transactions carried out by Yap Eng Piow under account no 39931/39 and 44521/39, I hold that the plaintiff is not vicariously liable for any negligent advice rendered by Yap to the defendant.
 37.I next turn to the question of reliance. Although the defendant had painted herself as a person who knew little of business affairs and therefore relied heavily on the advice of PW1 and Yap Eng Piow, there is ample evidence that she is more sophisticated than that. From her performance on the witness stand, I do not find her to be that simple of mind; indeed she struck me as a person who is capable of holding her own in the rough and tumble world of business. And an analysis of the evidence supports this conclusion. She was in the housing agency business since 1981 and had been a director of nine companies. She had bought and sold several properties for herself since 1981 and had planned to buy a property in Hong Kong. She had been trading in shares since 1989 and had a trading account with another stockbroker, RHB Cathay, during the time she was trading with the plaintiff. She had seven bank accounts during the material time, and a US$110,000 deposit in Hong Kong. PW1 said that the defendant ran her account well and knew what she was doing. This evidence was not challenged by Mr Yap.
 38.Furthermore, there was evidence that the defendant had a strong gambling streak, as the following parts of the evidence show: (i). Under cross-examination, she revealed that in 1993 she increased the credit facilities in her OCBC Bank SMTA account from $100,000 to $900,000 in order to pay for 737,000 Kamunting shares that her brother, a `small-time` vegetable wholesaler, had ordered but was unable to pick up. The total cost was about $860,000. She said that her brother had told her that he had heard `rumours` about Kamunting, presumably about a forthcoming rise in the share price. But she did not check with her broker before committing herself to such large sum. Yet, her evidence throughout was that she was ill-able to afford to lose such large sums of money.
 (ii). An analysis of the defendant`s transactions during the `hectic` period from late 1993 to January 1994 will show that, for a person of the defendant`s means, the transactions she had authorised PW1 and Yap Eng Piow to enter into, even if they had recommended them, required someone with strong nerves. As defence counsel Mr Yap had pointed out, the buy orders for January 1994 totalled $9.4m and RM3.2m.
 (iii). Despite suffering such huge losses in 1994, the defendant was back in the stock market in a big way by September 1995 after she opened a trading account with Lee & Co, another stockbroker. In June 1996, she bought in 50,000 shares of Hock Seng Lee, a Malaysian counter, at a total cost of about $240,000 and made a contra loss of about $36,000. About the same time, she bought about $130,000 worth of shares in SAAG Corp, another Malaysian stock. That month she made a net loss of $106,000. When asked why she had bought those counters, she said that her broker had recommended them and she had `left it to him`. When asked how she had expected to pay for those shares, she said that her broker had told her that she could `contra` them. She agreed that those were speculative counters. When asked why she had paid up her losses when the transactions were done on the wrong recommendation of her broker, she said that she paid up because it was `a relatively small amount`.
 39.Therefore on the evidence before me, I conclude that the defendant was at least a fairly sophisticated investor and that she was a person who was willing to take considerable risks on the stock market in the hope of huge gains. I conclude that she could not have relied on any advice as she had claimed had emanated from PW1 or Yap to an extent that would render them liable to her if these were negligent.
 40.Finally the defendant must still prove that, even if advice was given as alleged, such advice was negligent, i.e. the defendant must give evidence showing that the advice given was negligent, having regard to the circumstances prevailing at the time. To prove that it was negligent, the defendant relies solely on the fact that the advice turned out to be wrong. In 
Stafford v Conti Commodity Services Ltd
 
[1981] 1 All ER 691
, the plaintiff sued his broker for losses in the commodities market that he had suffered as a consequence of his reliance on the advice of the broker. The plaintiff relied on the losses incurred and the failure to realise profits to show that the broker`s advice was negligent. Mocatta J held that in such an unpredictable market, `it would require exceedingly strong evidence from expert brokers in relation to individual transactions to establish negligence` and said that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur did not apply. I would respectfully agree. If anyone knew for certain the direction that the prices of certain stocks would take it would not be necessary for him to engage in any occupation other than the buying or selling such stocks. And he would not share this information. The stock market is well known to be unpredictable and any recommendation or advice therefore carries the inherent risk that it may be wrong. The fact that a recommendation turns out to be wrong does not mean it was negligent when it was given. Of course there may be situations in which no broker will advise a certain course of action and if any broker did, he could be negligent. But to establish negligence in this case it will be necessary for the defendant to produce evidence from experts in this field that the alleged advice was not one which ought to have been given in the circumstances. The defendant has not produced such evidence and therefore her allegation that the advice was negligent must fail.
 41.
 Conclusion
Accordingly, I gave judgment for the plaintiff in respect of its claim for the losses in respect of the four accounts. In respect of the plaintiff`s claim for interest, having found that the accounts under PW1, ie 10006/01 and 10978/01 were not governed by the terms and conditions found in the application form for account no 39931/39 (BA321), it follows that there was no contractual right on the part of the plaintiff to recover interest from the defendant on outstanding payments at the rate of 3.5% above OCBC prime. In respect of the losses under these two accounts, I awarded interest from the date of the writ of summons at 6% per annum. In respect of the losses under the accounts operated through Yap Eng Piow, ie 39931/39 and 44521/39, I awarded interest at the contractual rate of 3.5% above OCBC prime from the date due of the various payments under these accounts. The parties are agreed that, up to 16 August 1994, such interest amount to $9,752.23 and $6,813.41 respectively. I also ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff`s costs in this action.",1998-02-16 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
KARTHIGESU JA
 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death on a charge of trafficking in a controlled drug specified in class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1997 Ed) (the Act) by having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking at his flat at Block 438, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, #04-1341, Singapore, not less than 32.31g of diamorphine, without any authorisation under the Act or the regulations made thereunder, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Act. We heard his appeal on 19 January 1998, which we dismissed, without the necessity of hearing the deputy public prosecutor, for the reasons we now give.
 2.The appellant who was in the company of one Lee Boon Hwi (Lee) was arrested by a team of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) at the ground floor of Block 438 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 as he and Lee came out of the lift servicing the block at about 2.35pm on 1 May 1997. Lee was also arrested; he attempted to escape but was chased by the CNB officers and subdued after a violent struggle before his arrest was effected. In fact a team of CNB officers had kept the lift lobby on the ground floor of Block 438 under surveillance from about 11am that day. ASP William Chew (ASP Chew) and another team of CNB officers arrived at the scene at the time of the arrest and ASP Chew took charge of the appellant. ASP Chew had been monitoring the surveillance over the radio and had heard the message to move in to effect the arrest of the appellant.
 3.At the time of his arrest, the appellant had on him, inter alia, two pagers, a mobile phone, $1,037.35 in cash in addition to the cash in his wallet which amounted to $454. At the void deck of Block 438 ASP Chew engaged the appellant in conversation. They spoke to each other in the Hokkien dialect. We will refer to this conversation again later but for present purposes the gist of the conversation was as to where his house keys were, whether he had anything in the house, how much it was, who gave it to him and when. The appellant`s responses were that he had his house keys with him, that he had something in the house, that it was a lot and was given to him by one Ah `A`, a Malaysian, at his flat at about 2am. ASP Chew and two other CNB officers asked the appellant to take them to his flat. When the appellant escorted by ASP Chew and the two CNB officers arrived outside flat #04-1341, the door was unlocked by one of the two keys recovered from the appellant. The other key fitted the padlock on the iron grille gate which was then open.
 4.They entered the flat. There was no one in the flat. The appellant led ASP Chew to the master bedroom and drew ASP Chew`s attention to the top shelf of the wardrobe. ASP Chew opened the wardrobe and brought down a large bag that was there. This bag is referred to as `Bag A`. ASP Chew asked the appellant in Hokkien how much there was in the bag and what were the combination numbers of the lock. The appellant answered seven to eight bundles and 969.
 5.When Bag A was opened with the use of the combination numbers of the lock given by the appellant and unzipped it was found to contain the following: (i). a Bodypac bag in which were eight large plastic sachets containing a pink substance;
 (ii). a red plastic bag in which were 15 brown envelopes, each containing 10 small plastic sachets of pinkish substance;
 (iii). another red plastic bag containing three small plastic sachets of pinkish substance and a substantial quantity of empty plastic sachets of the same size;
 (iv). an electric plastic sachet sealer, empty plastic sachets, bundles of brown envelopes, an electronic weighing scale, a packet of surgical gloves and a set of keys;
 (v). also found in the flat were a mobile phone charger, $1,400 in cash, a tenancy agreement in respect of the flat between the appellant and the owner of the flat and items of clothing.
 The pink substances were sent for chemical analysis and found to contain not less than 32.31g of diamorphine. This was the subject matter of the charge.
 6.The tenancy agreement above referred to was dated 26 April 1997. The agreed rental was $1,300 per month and the duration of the tenancy was for one year with effect from 28 April 1997. The owner of the flat was called as a witness by the prosecution. She testified that she engaged the services of a property agent to rent out the flat. She had specified to the agent that she would only rent the flat to a married couple. On 25 April 1997 the agent brought the appellant and a Chinese woman to view the flat. She had assumed the Chinese woman was the appellant`s wife. The next day the two of them agreed to rent the flat and signed the tenancy agreement. Upon signing the tenancy agreement, the appellant paid her a total of $2,700 in cash, being one month`s rent in advance, one month`s rent as a deposit and $100 as a deposit for utilities.
 7.We should now refer to the two conversations ASP Chew had with the appellant. Before leaving the flat ASP Chew wrote down on a sheet of paper the questions he had asked the appellant at the void deck as well as in the master bedroom and the answers the appellant gave. Having done that he read out what he had written down to the appellant and asked the appellant to sign. The appellant did. ASP Chew also signed. We reproduce below what ASP Chew wrote down and refer to it hereafter as `P74`:

 8.The prosecution sought to admit in evidence the oral statements we have referred to at [para ] 3 and 4 above and P74. However defence counsel raised objections and a voir dire was held. Firstly, he contended that if the oral statements were in the nature of admissions, they were not voluntarily made and secondly, in any event, P74 was inadmissible because it was not tendered at the preliminary inquiry.
 9.Dealing with P74, it was painstakingly pointed out to defence counsel by the trial judge that he was mistaken in his submissions because ASP Chew in his evidence at the preliminary inquiry referred to both the oral statements and the fact that he subsequently reduced the oral statements into writing (P74) which he said he now produced. The fact that P74 was not included with the preliminary inquiry papers must have been an oversight. Defence counsel should have called for it and had he done so it would undoubtedly have been produced to him. Certainly defence counsel was not prejudiced by the non-production of P74 for he is recorded in the transcript of the proceedings as saying - 
 `your Honour, really the reason was to demonstrate this before your Honour, that it was not given to me, but I had an inkling from the statement what the contents were.` 
 Mr Low Tiang Hock who appeared before us as appellant`s counsel was defence counsel at the trial.
 10.The learned judge dismissed the point as being one without merit but defence counsel persisted in it and it was also the main point of his submissions before us. In substance his submission was that P74 was a statement recorded under s 122(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. This could not have been further from the truth as ASP Chew`s evidence is crystal clear that the first lot of questions were asked of the appellant at the void deck on the ground floor of Block 438 immediately following the appellant`s arrest. The second set of questions were asked in the master bedroom of flat #04-1341 as soon as the appellant, ASP Chew and the escorting narcotic officers had arrived there and the appellant had indicated with his chin to the wardrobe as to where `the anything` was. It was plainly and simply a contemporaneous note of the oral statements made by the appellant immediately following his arrest, no doubt prompted by the questions put to him. `Investigation` as one understands it, in the context of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) or otherwise could hardly have begun so immediately following the arrest. In our view, the oral statements are relevant as they go to show that the appellant had the knowledge of the nature of the substances he was in possession of and form part of the transaction of being in possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking. They are therefore relevant and admissible under ss 6 and 5 respectfully of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (see 
Chi Tin Hui v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 778
  at pp 780 and 785). P74 was but a contemporaneous record of the oral statements.
 11.Then it was submitted that when s 122(1) was read with s 141 of the Criminal Procedure Code the effect was to forbid the admission of the P74 as it was not tendered at the preliminary inquiry. There were many fallacies here. Firstly, ASP Chew was a narcotics officer and not a police officer. The Court of Criminal Appeal settled beyond doubt that narcotics officers are not police officers and that statements made to narcotics officers are not subject to s 122(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code or ss 25 and 26 of the Evidence Act. See 
Sim Ah Cheoh & Ors v PP
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
  at p 360; [1991] 1 SLR 150 at p 163, 
Tan Boon Tat v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 1
  at p 9 and 
Tan Siew Chay & Ors v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
  at p 26H. Furthermore, P74 was in fact tendered at the preliminary inquiry but through some error was not included with the preliminary inquiry papers: see [para ] 9 above.
 12.Turning now to the admission of the oral statements the appellant`s evidence was that neither ASP Chew nor any of the narcotics officers involved in his arrest had treated him violently or had offered any inducement; or made any threat or promise as a consequence of which he had given the answers he did give to ASP Chew`s questions. His evidence was that he was put in fear when he witnessed Lee being arrested. The arresting officers, and there was several of them, had manhandled Lee, assaulted Lee, some had even kicked Lee when he was down before he was handcuffed. If this was what the arresting officers would do to Lee in the full glare of public view, he wondered what they would do to him when they had got him to the solitude of his flat where they were going to take him. The mere thought had frightened him to such an extent that he had urinated in his pants. His fear was so great that his will collapsed and he meekly answered the questions put to him by ASP Chew. In fact no visible bruises were found on Lee. It was a case of restraining a person fleeing from arrest and resisting it violently. Based on this evidence defence counsel made an esoteric but specious argument which he also repeated before us. The learned judge saw no merit in this argument and duly admitted the oral statements in evidence. We too did not see any merit in it. As this court said in 
Lu Lai Heng v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 251
 , a self-perceived inducement cannot in law amount to an inducement, threat or promise within the meaning of s 24 of the Evidence Act or s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The words in both provisions are clear; the inducement, threat or promise must move from a person in authority. Accordingly the learned judge rightly admitted the oral statements in evidence pursuant to s 24 of the Evidence Act. He also admitted P74 which served as corroborative evidence of the oral statements being made.
 13.There was no denying that the evidence of the oral statements were relevant and most damaging to the appellant. They showed the appellant`s knowledge of what Bag A contained. When he was asked whether there was `anything in the house`, his answer was `yes` and when asked `how much`, he replied `a lot`. Obviously he knew what ASP Chew meant by `anything` for it was by the appellant`s indication that Bag A was found and opened with the combination numbers the appellant gave. The substances contained in Bag A were found to be diamorphine. This evidence coupled with the evidence of the tenancy agreement of the flat #04-1341 was prima facie proof of possession of the 32.31g of diamorphine found in Bag A.
 14.At the close of the prosecution`s case the learned judge correctly assessed the evidence. In his grounds of judgment he said: 
At the close of the case for the prosecution, there was evidence that the accused was in possession of the bag found in the apartment, the accused knew the number of the combination lock to the bag and there was evidence that he knew what the bag contained. The amount of heroin in the bag was substantial. In addition, the bag also contained a sealing machine, a weighing scale and large quantities of empty sachets. All these, in the absence of other evidence, would suggest that the accused was trafficking in the heroin. I was satisfied that this evidence, on the basis of the 
 Haw Tua Tau
 test, was sufficient to call on the accused to make his defence.
 With this assessment of the evidence we entirely agreed.
 15.Defence counsel submitted before us that the learned judge had wrongly called on the appellant to make his defence. The basis of this submission was that the appellant`s oral statements ought not to have been admitted in evidence as without the oral statements there would be no direct evidence of possession of the drugs. In this case the learned judge would have had to rely on the statutory presumptions under the Act to presume possession. Defence counsel submitted that the learned judge had in fact relied on s 17 of the Act (presumption of trafficking) in calling upon the appellant to make his defence based on presumed possession.
 16.This, in our view, was not so. The learned judge was first satisfied without the aid of any statutory presumptions that there was sufficient evidence at the close of the prosecution`s case to justify calling on the defence. As we have already said the oral statements were rightly admitted in evidence and the learned judge had the evidence before him which we have summarised in the first six paragraphs of this judgment which he correctly evaluated as seen from that part of his grounds of judgment we have quoted in [para ] 14 above.
 17.It is true that the learned judge did refer to s 17 of the Act which he said could be relied on
 additionally 
. What he said was this: 
In addition, this was a case where the presumption under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act could well arise. By s 17, if the prosecution proved that the accused had in his possession more than 2g of diamorphine, the accused would be presumed to have had that drug in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. The proof incumbent on the prosecution is of course proof beyond reasonable doubt. At the close of the prosecution case there was prima facie evidence that the accused was in possession of what was found in the bag. Whether the prosecution had proved possession of the diamorphine beyond reasonable doubt was a matter that could be adjudicated upon only after the accused had been given the opportunity of stating his case. If, after hearing all the evidence the court was satisfied that the prosecution had satisfied that burden, the presumption would operate and it would be incumbent on the defence to rebut the presumption on a balance of probabilities.
 18.Appellant`s counsel obviously had not comprehended what the learned judge meant. What the learned judge meant was that if at the close of the prosecution`s case the factual evidence of possession of the drugs was not inherently incredible, ie a prima facie case of possession of the drugs was made out, the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the Act would arise. But the prosecution`s case, to warrant a conviction, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. So, possession, at the end of the trial, whether the appellant gave evidence or not, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. If at the end of the trial possession was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt the presumption of trafficking, even if not rebutted, would cease to operate. This lack of comprehension led to defence counsel belabouring `the no case to answer` point. It is clear that this is what the learned judge meant for towards the end of his grounds of judgment he says: 
Having heard all the evidence, I was satisfied that the prosecution had, to the necessary degree, proved that the accused was in possession of the drugs found in the flat. The presumption under s 17 therefore arose and it was for the accused to rebut that presumption on the balance of probabilities. In this case, the accused could clearly not do so.
 19.Finally, appellant`s counsel contended that the appellant did not have the ownership or possession of the drugs; that he had no knowledge that the substances found in Bag A were heroin; and that he lacked the necessary mens rea to traffic in the total amount of the heroin found in Bag A.
 20.Counsel for the appellant contended that the appellant had no possession, control or custody of heroin found in Bag A as he was a mere licensee of the flat and could deal with the heroin only on the instructions of one Wah Chye. Admittedly Wah Chye was not a fictitious person. There was evidence of frequent telephone calls between the appellant and Wah Chye; but even if it was established that Wah Chye was the owner of the heroin, ownership is not a prerequisite to trafficking (see 
Chan Hock Wai v PP
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 728
 ). As the learned judge observed, and we agreed, the appellant himself testified that it was he who put the pink substances in Bag A, locked the bag and kept it in the wardrobe in the master bedroom of the flat. In fact, it was he who packed the eight bundles of the pinkish substance into his own Bodypac bag. He did this on his own initiative. Clearly the appellant had possession, custody and control of Bag A and its contents. The only relevant issue then was whether the appellant had knowledge of the nature of the pink substances.
 21.The appellant maintained that because of the pink colour of the substances it did not occur to him that they were heroin. He thought they were some kind of medicine. Counsel submitted that this was credible because the appellant was not a user of heroin; he was not an addict. The learned judge refused to believe the appellant and drew the inference of knowledge from the suspicious circumstances of the case. The finding of the mental state of knowledge or the rebuttal of it is an inference to be drawn by a trial judge from all the facts and circumstances of the particular case, giving due weight to the credibility of the witnesses. The learned judge had the opportunity to observe the appellant when he gave his evidence and having assessed his evidence, the learned judge disbelieved him. This finding was neither against the weight of the evidence nor unsupportable. Accordingly we saw no reason to interfere with it. In passing we would note that the learned judge did not feel it necessary to rely on the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the Act.
 22.On the question of the mens rea to traffic in the quantity of the heroin found in Bag A, the appellant`s submission was that he was a national serviceman who was absent without leave; that he had already formed the intention to surrender himself to the army by 5 May 1997; and that he was mentally prepared to be detained for at least 14 days. As such he could not have had the mens rea to traffic in the total amount of the heroin found in Bag A, given that, on the evidence, he delivered only three envelopes in one afternoon, the most he could have delivered between 1 and 5 May 1997 on his reckoning was 4.19g. The learned judge was of the view that even if one accepted that the appellant was under such an impression, it would not be a defence to the charge of being in possession of 32.31g of diamorphine on 1 May 1997 for the purpose of trafficking. We agreed. Even if the appellant in preparation to surrendering to the army relinquished possession of the heroin to Wah Chye as the true owner of the heroin, this would still constitute trafficking (see

[1995] 1 SLR 274
 ; 
Lee Yuan Kwang & Ors v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 349
 ).
 23.There was no merit at all in any of the submissions made to us and we accordingly dismissed this appeal without having to hear the learned deputy public prosecutor.",1998-02-18 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant appealed against his conviction on a charge of driving while disqualified and on the consequential charge of driving without valid insurance coverage. These are offences under s 43(3A) Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1997 Ed) and s 3(1) Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189) respectively. On appeal it was argued that the learned district judge should not have accepted the prosecution`s evidence on the ground that it was in conflict with evidence given by one Ang Cheng Kok (Ang), now deceased. I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons.
 2.
 The prosecution`s case
I turn first to the evidence adduced by the prosecution. This was largely based on the testimonies of PW1 Cpl Roezaini bin Jamboori and PW2 SC Wakif bin Mohd Shariff. On the night of 24 August 1996, they were on duty together with SC Lee Tiong Peng, patrolling the Clementi area. At about 1am, while waiting at the traffic light junction of Dover Road and Clementi Road, PW1 spotted a white Volvo driving toward the Sussex Estate area. There was no dispute that the vehicle in question was SBC 9533E (the white Volvo). As the vehicle passed PW1 from the left, he noticed only one person, the driver, in the vehicle. At this point, PW1 alerted PW2 to also keep watch on the white Volvo.
 3.They observed the car turning into Sussex Estate via Horsham Road. Being familiar with the area`s high incidence of car-theft and house-breaking, PW1 followed the white Volvo into Sussex Estate. After turning into Horsham Road, he switched off his headlights and continued trailing the white Volvo.
 4.The white Volvo turned into a cul-de-sac, which was later identified by PW1 to be Arundel Road. PW2 testified that the white Volvo stopped at a spot near an animal clinic. The driver stepped out of the car and made his way towards the pavement. PW2 testified that he saw only one person alight from the car. PW1 directed PW2 and SC Lee to go and stop the driver. At the same time, PW1 switched on his car`s spotlights towards the driver and shouted for the driver to stop. However the driver continued walking nearer the bushes until PW2 and SC Lee caught hold of him and brought him back to the car. PW1 and PW2 identified the driver as the appellant.
 5.PW1 had suspected the case to be one of car-theft. He proceeded to question the appellant as to whose car he was driving. The appellant replied that the car was driven by a Chinese friend who stayed at Clementi Avenue 6 and that he himself was only a passenger in the car. He said that the friend had left to take some other transport home.
 6.PW3 Gan Boon Huay was the investigating officer in charge of the case and tendered documentary evidence showing the appellant`s disqualification on a previous conviction for drunken driving. He also brought a report from the insurance company that the policy for the white Volvo concerned would only cover a licensed driver. Investigations had revealed that the white Volvo had been given to one Kong Ah Swee (Kong) for repairs. Kong in turn had sent the vehicle to the appellant to be repaired.
 7.PW4 Yusri bin Saad was the investigating officer in charge of the appellant`s arrest. PW4 carried out investigations into the ownership of the vehicle and how it came into the hands of the appellant. On the morning of the appellant`s arrest, following statements made by the appellant, PW4 contacted Ang to go to the police for the purpose of making a statement.
 8.
 The defence
The appellant said that on the day in question, he had just finished repairing the white Volvo. Ang was going to help him test drive the car since Ang knew he was disqualified from driving. After work, he was driven home by Ang in the white Volvo to Horsham Road. He stayed at Block 407, Clementi Avenue 1 and this was just behind the Horsham Road area. They parked the car in a dead-end off Horsham Road, locked the vehicle and proceeded to walk to the main road. The appellant soon realized that he had left his pager in the car. Ang gave him the car keys and headed off home while he returned to get his pager from the car. Ang left the keys with the appellant because he would use the car the next day for his brother to fetch their mother to the market.
 9.When he had retrieved his pager from the white Volvo, the appellant headed home. Just as he was walking away near some bushes, he heard voices shouting for him to stop. The appellant got frightened and quickened his pace. He stopped when he saw the patrol car lights and policemen.
 10.The police officers brought the appellant back to the patrol car, made him remove his possessions and subjected him to a breathalyzer test. He denied being the driver of the car and told them that Ang was the driver. The appellant was then brought to Alexandra Hospital, and thereafter to Clementi Police Station where he was questioned by PW4.
 11.
 The hearing below
At trial, the appellant tendered a statutory declaration dated 15 May 1997 made by Ang who had since passed away. Two statements dated 28 August 1996 and 20 May 1997 made by Ang to the police were also admitted under s 378(1)(b)(i) read with s 379 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). The evidence from these documents was to the effect that on the evening in question Ang had met the appellant and then driven him in the white Volvo to a place within Sussex Estate where Ang parked the car. It was then about 11.30pm. Ang then walked with the appellant to the main road and, while waiting for a taxi-cab, the appellant told Ang that he had left his pager in the car. Ang handed the car key to the appellant and took a taxi home.
 12.
 The district judge`s decision
The district judge accepted PW1 and PW2`s version of the events as both these witnesses could testify to an unbroken chain of following the appellant driving alone from the time he was first sighted to his arrest. PW1 and PW2`s demeanour in giving evidence impressed the district judge as `candid and straightforward`. He was also of the view that if there was some truth in the appellant`s version that Ang was the driver of the vehicle, then the police officers would have at the very least seen Ang at some point of time. From the statements made by Ang, the district judge found that Ang may have driven the Volvo that night, but only at an earlier time than when the appellant was charged with driving the car. Accordingly, the district judge found that the appellant had driven the white Volvo on 25 August 1996 at about 1am along Horsham Road while he was disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles from 22 November 1993 to 21 November 1996. On the evidence, he also had no difficulty convicting the appellant on the second charge.
 13.
 The appeal
Before me, counsel for the appellant contended that there was insufficient evidence to prove the prosecution`s case beyond reasonable doubt, contending that the testimony of the prosecution`s witnesses was ambiguous and riddled with material inconsistencies. I have not found any such alleged `material inconsistencies`. Both PW1 and PW2 gave evidence which was clear and consistent on their patrol car`s unbroken trail of following the appellant in the white Volvo until he parked the vehicle. There was nothing in the evidence to suggest that the district judge erred in relying on the prosecution`s version of the facts.
 14.
 Whether an adverse inference should have been drawn
The district judge had rejected defence counsel`s submission that an adverse inference should be made against the prosecution for the non-production of Ang as a witness. On appeal, the appellant argued that this ruling prejudiced his defence. It was without doubt that Ang`s statement was important. However, as noted by the district judge, Ang`s evidence was clear and consistent that the times he drove the Volvo and parked it was around 11.30pm. This did not explain why the appellant was seen driving the car at 1am some hours later. Ang`s account related to a different time period from the time stated in the charge and given in court by the two police officers, PW1 and PW2. In fact, I noted a discrepancy in the times referred to by Ang in his statements. In his first statement made on 28 August 1996, Ang said that he parked the car at Sussex Estate at about 11.30pm and that he reached home at about 12 plus to 1am. In his second statement some nine months later, on 20 May 1997, the time he parked the car had wavered to `about 11.30pm to 12 midnight` and the time of his arrival home is `about 12.45pm`.
 15.A proper reading of 
Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 767
  supported the finding in the court below that it had to be distinguished in the present case. An adverse inference was drawn in that case because the witness known as `aunty` was not offered to the defence. This was unlike what transpired in the proceedings below. No prejudice was suffered by the appellant, given that Ang was interviewed by the defence and a statutory declaration obtained from him as early as 15 May 1997. It was this declaration which the district judge found lacking in detail compared with a statement made by Ang, interestingly, some five days later, to the police. In fact, the prosecution here had offered Ang as a witness, along with another officer, Lee Tiong Peng, to the defence. The defence accepted Ang while declining to use Lee as a witness. At p 26B of the notes of evidence, defence counsel himself stated that he had called the Dover Park Hospice where Ang was warded and had been informed that Ang would not be able to go to court.
 16.For the defence to imply that it was prejudiced by the prosecution`s failure to call Ang would be tantamount to suggesting that the prosecution failed to take all necessary measures to get Ang to court. Ang passed away on the night of the first day of the hearing. The need for his evidence must be tempered with some sense and sensitivity. Two statements and a statutory declaration had already been made by him. These were made at the requests of both the prosecution and the defence. It could not be right to suggest that anything more could have been done to secure more of Ang`s participation. And the defence was aware of this. It had the opportunity to obtain a more detailed statement from Ang, but the statutory declaration made by Ang on the facts failed to satisfy the court below. In the circumstances I saw no reason to disturb the district judge`s finding.
 17.
 Sentence
The appellant did not appeal against sentence, but I would take this opportunity to clarify his sentence. For the first charge, the appellant was sentenced to two months` imprisonment and ten years` disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles. For the second charge, he was fined $700 with one week`s imprisonment in default and one year`s disqualification for all classes. I confirm that the second period of disqualification will run concurrently with the first sentence of ten years` disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles.",1998-03-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

Cur Adv Vult
By this action, the plaintiffs, Jet Aviation (Singapore) Pte Ltd, seek an injunction to restrain the defendants, Jet Maintenance Pte Ltd, from passing off the defendants` business as the plaintiffs` business by the use of a logo bearing the words `Jet Aviation`.
 2.The plaintiff company was incorporated in Singapore in March 1980. Its founder, principal shareholder and director is Mr Robert Greatbatch.
 3.The defendants, also incorporated in Singapore, are ultimately owned by Hirschmann Industrial Holding Ltd of Switzerland, which owns also 19 other corporate entities in various parts of the world. These entities have different corporate names, but all have the words `Jet Aviation` as part of their names. All of them also use the same logo in connection with their business. It consists of the words `JET AVIATION` in blue, preceded by a device in red which is said to depict, in a stylised way, the shape of a stag`s head. The idea, not apparent of course to the uninitiated, is to link it with the name of the holding company mentioned above, `Hirsch` being the German word for a stag. The figure and the words `JET AVIATION` are linked by a line under them.
 4.Collectively, these entities, including the defendants, are referred to by themselves, if not by others as well, as the Jet Aviation Group of Companies (the Jet Aviation Group). The group, of course, is not itself a legal entity, but a label to a collectivity, but it is a useful label, and I shall use it.
 5.The group has its origin in a company established in 1967 at Basel, Switzerland to engage in the maintenance and servicing of corporate aircraft. This was followed by the establishment of companies in other parts of Switzerland, and the extension of their business to include business aircraft management and chartering and ground handling. This was followed in the 1970`s by expansion into Germany and Saudi Arabia, and in 1982, into the United States. In all these countries, new and separate companies were set up. As stated above, the name of each company contains the words `Jet Aviation` and each uses the logo in connection with its trading activities.
 6.As far as Singapore is concerned, there have been what might be called some facilitation activities undertaken for owners of private aircraft going back to the late 1970s (more about which later). In December 1989, a more permanent presence was established with the incorporation of a company by the name of Hirschmann Singapore Pte Ltd, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hirchsmann Industrial Holding Ltd. The group applied to register a company with the name `Jet Aviation Business Jets Pte Ltd`, but this name was not accepted by the Registry of Companies because of the existence of the plaintiff`s name on the register. It was then that the group first became aware of the existence of the plaintiffs in Singapore. Representatives of the group entered into negotiations with Mr Greatbatch to try to get to use the plaintiffs` name for their company in Singapore. But the parties could not agree on the terms.
 7.Mr Greatbatch had introduced various parties in the aviation industry in this region to the group, including DHP Aviation Pte Ltd, an aircraft maintenance company based at Seletar Airport. However, to Mr Greatbatch`s surprise, when the negotiations broke down, the group proceeded to acquire this company and started using it as the vehicle for its business here. That was in or about September 1995. The DHP name was changed to the defendants` present name. The company`s facilities were retrofitted and refurbished. Signboards bearing the `Jet Aviation` logo (described above) were put up, vehicles had this logo painted on their side panels, staff uniforms had woven badges containing the logo sewn on them, and letterheads used by the defendants had the logo printed at the top, while the defendants` company name appeared at the bottom.
 8.The plaintiffs objected to the use of the `Jet Aviation` logo by the defendants. There was no difficulty about the use of the defendants` name itself, as there is no similarity between it and the plaintiffs` name. It was the use of the logo containing the words `JET AVIATION` that the plaintiffs objected to. On 1 February 1996, the plaintiffs commenced the present action. They applied for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants from using the `Jet Aviation` logo. The application was dismissed, as the defendants agreed to voluntarily cease using the logo pending trial of the action.
 9.
 Issues in the case
The central issue in this case is whether the plaintiffs have by the use of the words `Jet Aviation` in connection with their business so intimately identified the words with their business that the use of the words by the defendants would have the effect of passing off the defendants` business as that of the plaintiffs. To answer this question, it is necessary to see what are the respective businesses carried on by the two parties. The Jet Aviation Group`s business, far flung and extensive as it is, may be encapsulated in a few words. Basically, it is concerned with the business of and about private aircraft (business jets, executive jets, whatever one prefers to call them). It owns and operates its own aircraft; it charters aircraft to customers; it operates private jets for its customers; it also services and maintains private jets for its customers.
 10.The plaintiff company is essentially an extension of Mr Greatbatch. He is the major shareholder and decision-maker in the company. When he incorporated the company in 1980, he had behind him many years of experience selling small aircraft from US and British aircraft manufacturers, including sales to parts of Africa, Eastern Europe, as well as Indonesia and Philippines. A British national, he has been based in Singapore since 1974, and there is no doubt that he knows the regional market here well.
 11.Mr Greatbatch describes the plaintiff company`s business as that of providing aviation consultancy and product representation and support services. These services, he says, include flight simulation training and consultancy, provision of engineering manpower requirement to the aerospace industries, marketing services for aerospace manufacturers and operators, and distribution of aviation products. He says the company also provides air charter and airline management services.
 12.In the directors` report attached to accounts of the company from 1980 to 1992, the principal activities of the company were described as those of providing aircraft spares procurement services to airline and air charter companies, acting as a broker for the sales and purchases of aircraft and related spare parts, and providing aviation consultancy services.
 13.The directors` report for the year 1993 and 1994 state that the company did not conduct any business activities under its name, and that the business of the company was conducted under the name of Airtrade Parts Direct, a US supplier of aircraft spare parts which the plaintiffs had acquired. However, the 1995 report states that Airtrade Parts Direct did not conduct any business activities in that year, but that the company itself did so. One, I do not know if it was the only one, contract that the company entered into in that year was with an engineering subsidiary of Singapore Airlines for the supply of aircraft technicians and engineers.
 14.The nature of the plaintiff company`s business and the manner in which it is carried on are dictated by the fact, as I stated earlier, that the company is essentially an extension of Mr Greatbatch. What the company can do is much tied to what Mr Greatbatch personally can do. In most of the transactions which have involved the provision of hardware and services, the company`s usual role has been that of a broker, as stated in the directors` reports referred to earlier. The actual suppliers are third parties in the more advanced countries in the West.
 15.In the early years of the company, from 1981 to 1987, the sales turnover reached as high as $3m. It was impressive for an essentially one-man company. However, from 1988 onwards, except for a burst in 1990 and 1991, the business has been a mere shadow of its former self, with sales of only a few hundred thousand dollars. The uncertain direction of the company is shown by the decision to trade under the Airtrade Parts Direct name in 1993 and 1994. At that time, Airtrade`s name and logo was actively promoted, more so than the company`s own name. For instance, when Mr Greatbatch decided to go into a venture in Malaysia, the company was named `Airtrade Parts Aviation Consultants (M) Sdn Bhd.`, rather than after the plaintiff company`s own name.
 16.It is not known what business the company has been doing since 1995, or the extent of it. I would assume that Mr Greatbatch has not been idle, and would have been looking for opportunities wherever they may be found in this region in the general areas of activities he has been engaged in over the years.
 17.
 So?
I return to the question I posed earlier. Has the plaintiff company`s name become by user so intimately identified with its business or services that the use of the words `Jet Aviation` by the defendants has, or is likely to have, the effect of passing off the defendants` business or services as that or those of the plaintiffs?
 18.From what has been described above, it seems to me that there is a gulf of difference in the nature of the businesses the parties are engaged in. There is undoubtedly a difference in the clientele and in the market that each serves. Furthermore, those that either party serves are people in the industry or people (such as the owners of private jets) who are sophisticated and knowledgeable as to who they are dealing with.
 19.Mr Gerard De Vaz, the founder and managing director of an aircraft chartering company called Region Air Pte Ltd, knows Mr Greatbatch. He knows Mr Greatbatch more than he knows the plaintiff company. But he knows the Jet Aviation Group much more distinctly. He knows of Mr Greatbatch`s business largely in relation to spare parts. But when it comes to executive jets, or anything to do with executive jets, it is the Jet Aviation Group (the `Swiss Company`, he calls it) that he would think of.
 20.The burden lies on the plaintiffs to prove that the defendants` use of the words `Jet Aviation` tends to lead people to suppose that what the defendants provide by way of their business is that of the plaintiffs. It is common ground that the words are descriptive words and not fancy words that readily identifies a party`s business or services. It is more difficult for a party who uses descriptive words for his business or services to prove that they refer to his alone. Speaking in the context of a manufacturer of goods, Lord Halsbury once said: `Whenever you take a name which correctly and simply identifies itself with the qualities of the thing manufactured, you increase the difficulty of establishing that it tends to lead people to suppose that it is the manufacture of a particular person or a particular company.` 
Electromobile Co Ltd v British Electromobile Co Ltd
 
[1908] 25 RPC 149
 at p 154.
 21.Whether a name is descriptive in this context is obviously a matter of degree. `Jet Aviation` is undoubtedly less descriptive than, say, `Vacuum Cleaner` in 
British Vacuum Cleaner Co Ltd v New Vacuum Cleaner Co Ltd
 
[1907] 24 RPC 641
, or `Office Cleaning` in 
Office Cleaning Services Ltd v Westminster Window & General Cleaners Ltd
 
[1946] 63 RPC 39
. However, the plaintiffs still have to show that the use of these words by others would tend to mislead potential customers of the plaintiffs into thinking that the services provided by the defendants are those of the plaintiffs. This is where the plaintiffs have considerable difficulties by reason of the differences in the nature of their businesses and the clientele and market they each serve, as I have set out above.
 22.There have been two instances of actual confusion since the defendant company was established here. First, in November 1995, a parcel intended for the defendants was sent through the couriers Federal Express. It was addressed wrongly to `Jet Aviation Pte Ltd` (the plaintiffs` name), but with the defendants` address at Seletar Airport. Later, another parcel was addressed to `Jet Aviation/Singapore, c/o Jet Maintenance Pte Ltd` with, again, the defendants` address at Seletar Airport. On each occasion, the parcel was duly received by the defendants. However, Federal Express, with whom the plaintiffs had an account, debited the plaintiffs for the charges in respect of the shipment. There was another instance where a letter from the plaintiffs` client in Indonesia was faxed by mistake to the defendants. However, this was immediately re-faxed by the defendants to the plaintiffs.
 23.Such confusions are undoubtedly a nuisance to both parties. However, they are not the sort of confusion which sustain an action of passing-off. The law of passing-off is addressed to the protection of a party from loss of custom resulting from a misrepresentation by another. Where there is no such loss or no reasonable likelihood of such loss resulting from a confusion of names, there is no cause of action in passing-off. The editors of 48 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) para 183 are right on point when they say: 
Confusion without damage. In some circumstances where one business is confused with another, there may be, nevertheless, no damage which will sustain a passing-off action. This is so even where the plaintiff and the defendant are in directly competing fields of business if the confusion is likely to be rapidly put right or if it causes clerical and administrative errors, which lead to misdirected letters and telephone calls but which are likely to be put right because of the way in which the business is conducted without resulting in any loss or diversion of business from the plaintiff. Similarly, confusion and inconvenience caused by the adoption of the same telegraphic address, or of the plaintiff`s failure to take extra precautions in identifying himself to persons with whom he corresponds, have been held insufficient to sustain an action.
 24.Lord Greene in 
Marengo v Daily Sketch & Sunday Graphic Ltd
 
[1992] FSR 1
, put it this way: 
No one is entitled to be protected against confusion as such. Confusion may result from the collision of two independent rights or liberties and where it is the case, neither party can complain; they must put up with the results of the confusion as one of the misfortunes which occur in life. The protection to which a man is entitled is protection against passing-off which is quite a different thing from mere confusion.
 25.See also Hwang JC`s judgment in 
Mechanical Handling Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Material Handling Engineering Pte Ltd
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 205
 .
 26.The plaintiffs have not shown any loss or diversion of business or any likelihood of it. In fact they rely on just these two instances of confusion for that. That is hardly good enough. So, on this ground alone, ie that the plaintiffs have failed to prove their case of misrepresentation resulting in loss, their claim must fail.
 27.
 Other defences
The defendants resist the plaintiffs` claim on another ground. They rely on what they call the Jet Aviation Group`s international reputation. They say that the group has established such a prominent reputation and goodwill in territories outside Singapore that it is not necessary for it to have carried on business within Singapore for its business to have gained goodwill here. In any event, the group has been carrying on business activities in Singapore for many years.
 28.For their group`s reputation and goodwill outside Singapore, the defendants rely on the following facts. First, the long history of their group`s business operations since the 1960s and the use of the Jet Aviation name and logo in all the countries in which they have been carrying on business. Second, the undisputed reputation the group has established for itself in all these countries. Third, the publicity in the form of advertisements about the group in aviation-related publications and in the form of articles written about the group`s activities. Lastly, regular participations in business aircraft conventions.
 29.The Singapore connection, they say, has arisen, first, from the fact that these publications are available to people engaged in the aviation industry in Singapore. Secondly, since 1978, constituent companies of the group have been `operating flights` in and out of Singapore for a long string of owners of private aircraft, including nobilities and royalties of various countries. This involves arranging for permits from the authorities; arranging for ground services, transportation and accommodation for crew and passenger, arranging for the servicing, maintenance and repairs of the aircraft when needed, etc. In carrying out these activities, the group`s representatives have had regular contacts with the authorities and businesses here in Singapore. It is submitted by the defendants that these activities of the Jet Aviation group over the years have generated sufficient goodwill within Singapore to enable them to say that the plaintiffs cannot claim exclusivity in the goodwill attached to the words `Jet Aviation`.
 30.
 The law
There are two opposing lines of authorities on the question whether and to what extent a foreign-based business has to have carried on business activities within the jurisdiction for it to claim goodwill within the jurisdiction. At one end, there is the view that goodwill is local and territorial in character, it attaches to a business, and a person acquires a goodwill only in the territory in which it is carried on. Lord Diplock in 
Star Industrial Co Ltd v Yap Kwee Kor
 [1975-1977] SLR 20 said: 
Goodwill, as the subject of proprietary rights, is incapable of subsisting by itself. It has no independent existence apart from the business to which it is attached. It is local in character and indivisible; if the business is carried on in several countries, a separate goodwill attaches to it in each. So when the business is abandoned in one country in which it has acquired a goodwill, the goodwill in that country perishes with it although the business may continue to be carried on in other countries `
 31.The opposing, or modified view, is found in a large body of other authorities from various countries of the Commonwealth. An example from England is the case of 
Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co v Gutman
 
[1976] FSR 545
, where Graham J said: 
The existence and extent of reputation in my judgment is essentially a question of fact. Similarly, the existence and extent of the goodwill acquired by virtue of a trader`s business and reputation seems to me equally to be one of fact. This being so, I do not see how one can properly lay down artificial limits as to the geographical areas over which reputation and goodwill can or cannot extend, nor state rules as to what a trader must or must not do to prove the existence of such reputation and goodwill. Being questions of fact, the court must be guided, and guided only by what the proved facts establish.
 32.Commenting on Lord Diplock`s dictum in the 
 Star Industrial Co 
 case, his honour said: 
Whilst not wishing to quarrel with the decisions in question I believe myself that the true legal position is best expressed by the general proposition, which seems to me to be derived from the general line of past authority, that the existence and extent of the plaintiffs` reputation and goodwill in every case is one of fact however it may be proved and whatever it is based on.
 33.From Ireland, there is the case of 
C & A Modes v C & A (Waterford) Ltd
 
[1978] FSR 126
, where Henchy J in the Supreme Court said: 
Goodwill does not necessarily stop at a frontier. Whether in a particular area a plaintiff has a goodwill which is liable to be damaged by the unlawful competition resulting from passing off is a question of fact and of degree. What has to be established for the success of a plaintiff`s claim in an action such as this is that by his business activities - be they by direct selling within the State or otherwise - he has generated within the State a property right in a goodwill which will be violated by the passing off.
 34.In the Hong Kong case of 
JC Penney Co Inc v Punjabi Nick
 
[1979] FSR 26
, Leonard J, in an interlocutory application, held that a US corporation with a well-known reputation in the US and elsewhere had acquired goodwill in Hong Kong merely by carrying on purchasing activities in Hong Kong for goods to be sold elsewhere. His honour said: 
In these days of expanding travel and tourism, I would anticipate a development in the law of passing-off whereby owners of reputation and goodwill acquired abroad may be granted protection for that reputation and goodwill here even though they do not carry on business here and even though its goods themselves have earned no reputation here.
 35.In 
Tan-Ichi Co Ltd v Jancar Ltd
 
[1990] FSR 151
, another Hong Kong case, Sears J in an interlocutory application held that the proprietors of a Japanese chain of restaurants with a well-established reputation in Japan had an arguable case of passing-off against someone in Hong Kong who had deliberately copied their name for a restaurant in Hong Kong even though the Japanese plaintiffs had had no business presence in Hong Kong. The learned judge relied on the Canadian case of 
 Orkin Exterminating Co Inc v Pestco of Canada 
 (1985) 19 DLR (3d) 90 and the New Zealand case of 
Dominion Rent-A-Car Ltd v Budget Rent-A-Car Systems
 
[1987] 2 NZLR 395
.
 36.In 
ConAgra Inc v McCain Foods (Aust) Pty Ltd
 
[1992] AIPC 90
-892, the full court of the Federal Court of Australia held that in a passing-off claim, the foreign plaintiff does not have to have a place of business or business presence in Australia; nor is it necessary that his goods are sold there. Lockhart J, whose view was shared by his brethren in the case, said: 
It is sufficient if his goods have a reputation in this country amongst persons here, whether residents or otherwise, of a sufficient degree to establish that there is a likelihood of deception among consumers and potential consumers and of damage to his reputation.
 37.Gummow J put in this way: 
In my view, where the plaintiff, by reasons of business operations conducted outside the jurisdiction, has acquired a reputation with a substantial number of persons who would be potential customers were it to commence business within the jurisdiction, the plaintiff has in a real sense a commercial position or advantage which it may turn to account.
 38.
 The Singapore position
The Singapore High Court case of 
Tan Gek Neo v Minister for Finance
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 301
  
[1991] SLR 325
 was a contest between JC Penney Company Inc, a US corporation, and a Singapore individual over the use by the latter of the name `JC Penney Collections`. The Registrar of Business Names, acting under s 11 of the Business Registration Act 1973, had ordered the Singapore party to change her business name in such a way as to avoid using the words `JC Penney` or `Penneys` on the ground that the name in question so nearly resembled the name of the US corporation as to be calculated to mislead. On an appeal to the High Court, the Registrar`s decision was reversed. In the way the case was presented, LP Thean J (as he then was) found that he had to deal with the allegation that the local individual was `riding on the reputation` of the foreign corporation. He found that the foreign corporation was not carrying on and had not carried on business here; neither had it or its affiliates made use of two trade marks which it had registered here. His honour found that the foreign corporation had, therefore, no reputation or goodwill in Singapore, and there was no question of the local party riding on its reputation. In this connection, his honour cited the dictum of Lord Diplock in the 
 Star Industrial 
 case which I set out earlier.
 39.It must be noted that none of the other cases bearing on the question under discussion here and which I have referred to was brought to the attention of LP Thean J; the 
 ConAgra 
 case was not decided until a year later. The question whether an overseas party is capable in fact of acquiring goodwill within the jurisdiction even though it does not carry on business here was therefore not fully explored.
 40.In 
RH Macy & Co Inc v Trade Accents
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 581
 , a trade mark case, Rubin JC (as he then was) found that the US corporation had acquired sufficient goodwill and reputation in its name from the substantial amount of purchases through its representative office here. His honour saw the facts in the case as largely similar to those in the Hong Kong 
 Punjabi Nick 
 case, supra, and he associated himself with the remarks of Leonard J in that case which I have set out above.
 41.
 The better view?
So, as opposed to the classical statement of the rule in the
 Star Industrial Co 
 case, there is this weight of authorities from various parts of the common law countries in favour of a more elastic and realistic answer to the question: has goodwill attached in a particular territory to the business of the plaintiff? To what extent, if at all, is it necessary for the plaintiff to have carried on business within the jurisdiction for him to assert goodwill there?
 42.I have considerable sympathy for the views expressed in this body of cases. It seems to me that these questions, in the present-day context, cannot be adequately answered by elevating the traditional view, such as that postulated in the 
 Star Industrial Co 
 case, to a presumption or a rule of law. I would associate myself with those who prefer to treat the existence or otherwise of goodwill and reputation as a question of fact and degree to be proved in a particular case without the constraint of any rule or presumption. The question to be considered, simply, is whether the claimant has by his business activities, be they by direct trading within the jurisdiction or otherwise, in fact generated within the jurisdiction a goodwill in connection with his business which will be protected by the law of passing-off.
 43.
 The case at hand
The defendants, in relying on their international reputation, do not seek to stop the plaintiffs from using the plaintiffs` name. They have a more limited objective. They merely seek to show that as of the date of the alleged infringements complained of, ie by September 1995, they, too, had acquired goodwill in this country in relation to their businesses, and that the plaintiffs should not be allowed to claim that the words `Jet Aviation` belong to them exclusively. It is not absolutely clear, but as I understand it, this proposition is put forward within the context of the question referred to above whether the plaintiffs have by user identified the words `Jet Aviation` to their business to the exclusion of anybody else`s business.
 44.The defendants suggest that where a party has a well-established `international` reputation and goodwill, a slight amount of business activity within the jurisdiction is enough to enable it to claim goodwill. Like their honours in the 
 ConAgra 
 case, I would regard this proposition as rather artificial. I prefer, as I say, to treat the matter of the existence of goodwill essentially as a question of fact.
 45.So, has the Jet Aviation group, by reason of the activities which its constituent companies have engaged in here and abroad, established goodwill for its business and services in this country? I do not think that the defendants have succeeded in showing this to be the case. As they readily admit, the flights which the group has been `operating` have merely made stop-overs here. In the nature of things, these flights are never published; they are of no interest to anyone except those immediately concerned. It is also not known whether any Singapore residents have ever used these flights. It has not been shown that potential users in Singapore (assuming there are such) of the group`s services have been exposed to them in such a way that it can be said that the group has a potential following here. The group is probably quite well known among professionals in the field, such as Mr De Vaz, whose evidence I referred to earlier, but it may be a different matter when it comes to potential customers, potential customers from Singapore at that. The same goes for the promotional and public relations efforts which the group has undertaken over the years. So I do not think that the business activities referred to have generated any significant level of goodwill in Singapore for the group in the `Jet Aviation` name. But, as I said earlier, the plaintiffs, for their part, still have to show that the use of the words by the defendants would have the effect of passing off the business or services of the defendants as that of those of the plaintiffs.
 46.
 Other points
Before I conclude, I need to deal with one point that has been raised by the plaintiffs. It is that during the negotiations with plaintiffs for the right to use the plaintiffs` name, the Jet Aviation Group`s representatives by word and conduct admitted that the plaintiffs had substantial goodwill in the name `Jet Aviation`. I accept that there was probably such an admission, but I do not think, neither has it been suggested, that it has the effect of precluding the defendants from litigating the issues raised in this suit. The group was keen to start business in Singapore using a name with those two words; they were not able to do so because of the existence of the plaintiffs` name in the companies register. I accept that as businessmen, those in charge of the group took a commercial decision to negotiate with the plaintiffs to acquire the name. The admission was made in those circumstances and for that purpose. I do not see that it can have any effect on the issues which have arisen for consideration in these proceedings.
 47.The plaintiffs` claim is dismissed with costs on the first ground dealt with in this judgment, ie that they have failed to prove the likelihood of misrepresentation resulting in loss.",1998-03-13 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
KAN TING CHIU J
 
Cur Adv Vult
The plaintiff Ri Jong Son is a North Korean national and is the general manager of the Korea Daesong Bank (KDB) in Pyongyang. The plaintiff met Tatsuo Yoshinaga (Yoshinaga) a Japanese. Yoshinaga was a director and major shareholder of Hitaka Shoji (S) Pte Ltd (Hitaka Shoji), a company incorporated in Singapore.
 2.They had discussions which led to an agreement that the KDB and Hitaka Shoji would engage in a joint venture to deal in precious metals in Singapore.
 3.In furtherance of the agreement, a joint fixed deposit account in the names of the plaintiff and Yoshinaga was opened with the defendants on 1 August 1994. The account required the signatures of the plaintiff and Yoshinaga for its operation. The mailing address for the account was Yoshinaga`s address in Tokyo. The KDB made a payment of [yen ]100m through the Ashikaga Bank Ltd of Tokyo into the account on 9 February 1994. The [yen ]100m was placed into the joint account from 10 February to 13 February.
 4.On 10 February 1994, the defendants received remittance instructions purportedly signed by the plaintiff and Yoshinaga to transfer the [yen ]100m and accrued interest into an account Hitaka Shoji had with the defendants (DB12). The defendants complied with the instructions and transferred the [yen ]100m and accrued interest into Hitaka Shoji`s account on 13 February. The money was subsequently transferred out from Hitaka Shoji`s account.
 5.In this action the plaintiff says that his signature on the remittance instructions was forged and he only learnt of the transfer in July 1995. He seeks a declaration that the withdrawal of [yen ]100m was without authority and is of no effect. He claims that the defendants had debited the account without his instructions, and alternatively, that they were negligent in debiting the account.
 6.In their defence, the defendants did not address the issue of authority except by the standard denial of each and every allegation in the statement of claim. The defendants referred to the exemption clause and presumption clause in cll 7(b)(iii) and 16(a) of the terms and conditions governing accounts (amended defence paras 3.4, 3.6, 3.7 and DB77-80) and contended that they are absolved from liability by these provisions. I will refer to the effect and application of these provisions later.
 7.The plaintiff`s reply (paras 3-6) is that the Terms and Conditions did not govern the account because they were not furnished to him or brought to his notice, because the clauses were unclear and ambiguous, and because they were inoperative under the Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Ed) as they were unfair and unreasonable.
 8.
 Opening of the account
The parties` versions of the opening of the joint account on 1 August differed. According to the plaintiff, he and another officer of the KDB went to the defendants` offices in Shenton Way with Yoshinaga, Yoshinaga`s employee Mohamed Faruk, another Korean Bang Ryung Gu and another employee of Yoshinaga. At the bank, he handed his passport for his particulars to a bank officer to be recorded. The officer requested him and Yoshinaga to sign an application form and a signature verification card. He knew that the mailing address for the joint account was Yoshinaga`s address in Japan (notes of evidence p 10E-F) and did not speak to the bank officer beyond ensuring that his signature and Yoshinaga`s signature were needed to operate the account. After the account was opened, he was given a copy of the account application form and a cheque book, and no other documents.
 9.The plaintiff added that he did not know about any terms and conditions for the operation of the account, and that he did not ask Yoshinaga or the bank officers about them (notes of evidence pp 18E-19B). He did not know that there would be such terms and conditions (notes of evidence pp 4E-5A) and had not given thought to that (notes of evidence p 5E) although there would be such conditions when an account is opened in North Korea (notes of evidence p 4C).
 10.However he also said (notes of evidence p 19B-D) 
I thought if someone opens an account, the bank must explain the terms and conditions before opening the account.
 and 
At that time, I did not know if DBS had this kind of terms and conditions, so I did not ask for the bank to explain the terms and conditions. If some terms are not so good, I would take some action.
 This showed that he knew or expected that there would be conditions for the operation of the account that he opened with Yoshinaga.
 11.When asked if he thought about asking for the terms and conditions so that he can forward them to the KDB, he evaded the question and said 
DBS is one of the world`s biggest banks. I never expected this to happen - that someone withdraw my money with a fake signature (notes of evidence p 20B-C).
 12.Goh Rong Kai was the officer who attended to the opening of the account. He claimed he can remember that event specifically because the plaintiff was and continued to be the only North Korean that he had dealt with (affidavit of evidence-in-chief of Goh Rong Kai, para 5), but he showed himself to be an unsatisfactory witness.
 13.His evidence was that the plaintiff and Yoshinaga went with Mohamed Faruk to open the account. He deposed in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (para 6) that Mohamed Faruk `identified himself as being an associate of both the plaintiff and Tatsuo and also an employee of Hitaka Shoji ` In court, he said that Mohamed Faruk did not state his relationship to them, and that he had obtained it from his computer (notes of evidence pp 109D-110A). He then changed his evidence in re-examination and said that Mohamed Faruk told him he was an associate of the plaintiff and Yoshinaga (notes of evidence p 114B-C), further underlining his inconsistency and undermining his credibility.
 14.His evidence on the circumstances in which the Japanese mailing address was recorded also varied. He deposed in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (para 11) that 
I remember that I had at the material time found it to be very unusual for the plaintiff to instruct the defendants to send all mail/correspondence to an address in Japan when the plaintiff was himself a North Korean. I had, in fact, checked with the plaintiff to ascertain that he wanted all the mail/correspondence to be sent to Japan. The plaintiff confirmed the aforesaid position and I remember the plaintiff telling me that it would be inconvenient for him if the defendant were to send any mail/correspondence to him in North Korea.
 15.He agreed with the plaintiff`s counsel that the plaintiff did not speak to him, and explained that 
When I told him Mr Ri the mail would be sent to Japan, I will take it no mail will be sent to Korea. I take it as the norm - that a foreigner does not want mail to be sent to his address (notes of evidence p 107E-F).
 16.He also deposed (affidavit of evidence-in-chief para 14) that he handed to the plaintiff and Yoshinaga each a copy of the defendants` terms and conditions governing accounts (DB77-80). This part of his affidavit evidence was not contradicted by his evidence in court that he handed over the terms and conditions without explaining them to the plaintiff and Yoshinaga (notes of evidence pp 111B-C, 112A-B).
 17.Were the Terms and Conditions handed to the plaintiff? The defendants say they were, relying on the evidence of Goh Rong Kai. Although his evidence on this point was consistent, his evidence generally was unsatisfactory.
 18.The plaintiff`s evidence that he did not receive the Terms and Conditions has to be examined. He has been employed by the KDB since 1976 (notes of evidence p 3E) and is the general manager of the bank. He was in Singapore to open a bank account to facilitate the joint venture between his employers and Hitaka Shoji, and his employers had deposited [yen ]100m into the account. That was not his own money, and was a substantial sum by any standard. He would be answerable to his employers for the money in the account. As a bank officer of long standing, he could hardly have thought that the account was not governed by any operating conditions. His own evidence suggested that he knew or expected that there would be conditions. It is reasonable to infer that he had to report on the account that he had opened, and how it was to be operated. Even if he returned to Pyongyang without the information, his employers would want him to get them from the defendants, so that they would know how it is to be operated, but he never asked for them. He had been in contact with the defendants and could have brought that up. He communicated with them on 10 February 1995 (PB11) and 10 April 1995 (PB12-13). On 26 July 1995, after he had heard that Yoshinaga had transferred the [yen ]100m out of the joint account, he sent a telex (PB19) seeking information about the account. In all these communications, there was no request for the terms and conditions. The picture he sought to present was that even when he was anxious over the money in the account, he was not concerned that he did not have the rules for operating the account. I find that quite improbable. It is more likely that he was silent about them because he had received a copy of the Terms and Conditions when the account was opened, and I find that to be so on a balance of probabilities.
 19.
 Was the plaintiff`s signature forged?
The plaintiff says that he did not sign the remittance form (DB12). He learnt about the transfer from the former employees of Hitaka Shoji in July 1995 (affidavit of evidence-in-chief para 15). He immediately made enquiries on the defendants on 26 July (PB19) and was advised on 27 July that the withdrawal was made on 13 February on the joint application dated 10 February (PB23).
 20.The plaintiff did not ask for a copy of the remittance form when he received the defendants` reply. Subsequently, he came to Singapore and made a police report on 14 December (PB42). At that time he still had not seen the application form (notes of evidence p 15D).
 21.In the course of their investigations, the police requested the plaintiff to furnish them with documents bearing his signature (PB53). They specified that the specimen signatures should be signed before 1995 in a form similar to that appearing in the account opening application.
 22.The plaintiff did not supply the specimen signatures requested. He informed the police that (PB83) 
I take this opportunity to advise that I have used the same signature as that in my passport when I opened the captioned account since I thought that the passport is the only identification card which certifies me as a foreigner and I would have to work in Singapore with my passport.
 
In Korea I used to sign in rough Korean all the in-and-out documents.
 
Therefore there is no documents bearing similar signature to that I used to open the account with DBS, Singapore which can not enable me to send the required documents.
 23.When he gave evidence the plaintiff said that the reference to the rough Korean signature was incorrect, and that he had only one signature (notes of evidence pp 13D, 14D). He also denied that he informed the police that he had a signature different from the one in his passport (notes of evidence p 14A-B).
 24.The police referred the matter to the department of scientific services for investigation. Principal scientific officer Ng Gek Kwee undertook the investigation. She was given the remittance form dated 10 February 1995 (DB12) bearing the signature that the plaintiff claimed was forged. This signature is referred to as the questioned signature. She was also given the two account application forms (DB1 and DB3), bearing the plaintiff`s signature, ten sheets of specimen signatures that the plaintiff (DB92-101) had signed for the police and photocopies of the plaintiff`s police statement dated 14 December 1995 bearing his signatures (DB102-104). These signatures are referred to as the specimen signatures.
 25.Mrs Ng was requested to examine the documents and to render her expert opinion whether the person who wrote the specimen signatures also wrote the questioned signature. She studied the signatures and put up her report (PB115-120). She found differences in stroke fluency, slant and the formation and relative alignment of strokes and concluded that `there is no evidence indicate (sic) that the writer of the specimen signatures wrote the questioned signature of Ri Jong Son.` (PB117 para 6.)
 26.She explained that while there were significant differences between the questioned signature and the specimen signatures (notes of evidence p 85C-D), but she could not be sure that the differences were not the result of one person writing in two different styles or change of writing habit or disguise (notes of evidence p 81C-D) because of limited number of specimen signatures available (notes of evidence p 82B-C).
 27.Consultant document examiner Ch`ng Beng Han was engaged by the plaintiff to report on the same issue. Copies of the same documents sent to Mrs Ng were sent to him. Mr Ch`ng did not find the specimens signatures to be insufficient (notes of evidence p 32A). He found differences in stroke quality, slant, relative alignment and formation between the questioned signature and the specimen signatures. His opinion was that in all probability the writer of the specimen signatures did not write the questioned signature (PB179), and he had ruled out the possibility that the differences were within a writer`s natural range of variation (notes of evidence pp 49C-D, 52C).
 28.The defendants engaged the services of Christopher Ian Anderson, an Australian document examiner. Mr Anderson examined one more document than Mrs Ng and Mr Ch`ng - the plaintiff`s passport which bore his signature (PB86-87). Nevertheless he felt that his examination was hampered by the lack of suitable specimens of signatures signed in the usual course of business.
 29.Mr Anderson found seven differences between the questioned and specimen signatures, but admitted that 
I am unable to reach a conclusion as to whether or not the writer of the signatures written in Korean, purportedly by Ri Jong Son, on the specimen documents wrote the signature, written in Korean, on the questioned document
 
In other words, while there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that the writer of the Ri Jong Son specimen signatures wrote the signature on the questioned document, equally, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that this writer did not the write the signature on the questioned document (DB47-75).
 30.If the plaintiff had given the specimens of his signatures that the police had requested for, that would have assisted the document examination. His explanation that he could not do that because he signed in rough Korean in Korea was inconsistent with his own evidence that he has only one form of signature.
 31.On reviewing the evidence of the document examiners and the plaintiff, I do not regard his failure to produce signatures written in the normal course of business to be fatal because there were some such signatures in the account opening forms and his passport. Mrs Ng and Mr Anderson were able to examine the signatures and present their reports. Although both felt that the limited specimen signatures affected their examinations, neither said that their efforts were frustrated by that. Mr Ch`ng was satisfied with the number of specimens he received.
 32.Mrs Ng found no evidence that the questioned and specimen signatures were written by the same person. Mr Ch`ng`s conclusion was that in all probability they were not written by the same person, and Mr Anderson was unable to tell whether they were written by the same person or by different persons. Having observed the plaintiff giving his evidence on this issue, I accept that he did not sign the questioned signature. I find that he had satisfied the higher standard of proof needed to support a claim of forgery.
 33.
 The exemption clause
In view of my finding, cl 16(a) of the terms and conditions governing accounts (DB77-80) has to be considered. The clause stipulates that 
The bank shall not be liable for any loss damage or expense suffered or incurred by the customer (whether as a result of computer breakdown, forgery of signatory`s signature, material alteration of withdrawal/requests or other reasons of any kind whatsoever) through no fault of the bank.
 34.The defendants have their signature verification procedure. The plaintiff`s signature was verified by one of its officers, Leong Chow Yuet. She compared the questioned signature on the remittance form against the plaintiff`s signature in the specimen signature card and found them to be the same before she approved the remittance. Ms Leong is not a document examiner and did not use the same techniques as a document examiner. There is no suggestion that a bank must have such signatures examined by document examiners or that its officers should adopt the examiners` techniques in verifying signatures. The plaintiff had not criticised the defendants` verification procedure. There was nothing wrong with the procedure.
 35.If a customer complains of a negligent verification, the onus is on the customer to prove that. There was no suggestion, much less evidence, that Ms Leong was negligent when she verified the plaintiff`s signature. The plaintiff`s claim of negligence therefore fails.
 36.I have found that the terms and conditions governing accounts were furnished to the plaintiff. However his counsel submitted that the defendants also had a duty to bring their significance to his notice. Goh Rong Kai admitted that he did not explain the terms and conditions governing accounts when he handed to them the documents which were clearly captioned as such. There was little or no communication between the plaintiff and Goh Rong Kai because the former knew little or no English and the latter knew no Korean. It would be unduly onerous to require him to bring the plaintiff`s attention to the Terms and Conditions or to cl 16(a).
 37.Counsel did not elaborate on the complaint that the provisions are unclear and ambiguous. On my reading of the relevant provisions, they are neither.
 38.Lastly it was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the provisions are invalid under the Unfair Contract Terms Act because they are unfair and unreasonable.
 39.Section 2(2) of the Act reads 
In the case of other loss or damage [ie other than for death or personal injury], a person cannot so exclude or restrict his liability for negligence except in so far as the term or notice satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.
 The first point to note is that cl 16(a) did not seek to exclude or restrict the defendants` liability for negligence, so the requirement for reasonableness does not apply.
 40.Even if it does, s 11(1) of the Act provides that 
In relation to a contract term, the requirement of reasonableness for the purposes of this Part and section 3 of the Misrepresentation Act is that the term shall have been a fair and reasonable one to be included having regard to the circumstances which were, or ought reasonably to have been, known to or in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made.
 41.The defendants incorporated cl 16(a) on the establishment of the bank-customer relationship. They wanted to limit their liability to their customers so that they would not be liable for losses occurring through no fault on their part, without seeking to avoid liability for losses resulting from their fault.
 42.I do not see it as unreasonable or unfair in principle or practice for a bank to state that it would not assume liability for loss or damage unless they result from its fault. Clause 16(a) is set out in clear terms. A would-be customer can take his account to another bank if he found that term unacceptable.
 43.
 The presumption clause
The defendants also relied on cl 7(b)(iii)(bb) of the Terms and Conditions which obliges an account holder 
to examine all debit and credit entries in the statement of account and updated passbooks, statements, transaction advices, deposit advices and records (`transaction records`) and to report any omission from or debits/credits wrongly made or made without authority to or inaccurate entries in such statement of account and/or transaction records. Unless the debit or credit entries therein are objected to without 14 days after the customer`s receipt of his statement of account or his transaction records, such entries made in the statement of account or transaction records shall be deemed correct and shall be conclusive without further proof as against the customer
 44.Tan Peck Ai, an officer from the administration department of the defendants described in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief the defendants` procedure for sending weekly and quarterly statements of accounts and yearly interest statements to their customers. She believed (at para 18) that a weekly statement of accounts said to be exhibited in the affidavit of Goh Rong Kai, six quarterly statements of account exhibited in the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of Leong Chow Yuet and a yearly interest statement for 1995 were duly generated and mailed by the defendants to the mailing address in Japan. It is noteworthy that she stated that she believed and not that she knew that the statements were mailed. I will discuss this later.
 45.It apparently escaped the attention of Ms Tan that there was no weekly statement of accounts exhibited in the affidavit of Goh Rong Kai. When she was shown the defendants` supplementary bundle of documents (DSB1-14) which comprised one weekly statement of account, five quarterly statements of accounts and one yearly interest statement, she confirmed that these were the statements she was referring to. The mistakes over the weekly statement of and number of quarterly statements did not reflect well on the preparation of the case, and neither counsel appeared to have noticed them during the trial.
 46.The significance of the statements of accounts is that they stated that there was no deposit outstanding in the account during the periods covered in the statements and the interest statement stated that there was [yen ]1,560,000 in the account on 13 February 1995 instead of the [yen ]100m that was deposited earlier.
 47.Ms Tan`s belief that the statements were sent is not evidence of receipt, and unless a statement is received, the presumption of correctness under cl 7(b)(iii) does not arise. To cater for this, cl 21 (a) of the Terms and Conditions creates a presumption of receipt, that 
All notices and communications to the customer may be sent by post or left at the last address notified to the bank and shall be deemed to have been received by the customer on the day following such posting or on the day when it was so left or may be communicated through any media as shown by the bank and the customer shall be deemed to have notice thereof on the date of publication or communication.
 48.Ms Tan deposed that 
In the normal course of business, all of the envelopes containing the weekly statements of account will be put into the mail bags and collected by the staff from the Singapore Post for mailing the latest by the next day after the weekly statements of account have been collected from the data resources department (at para 11).
 She went on to say that the same procedure applies for the mailing of the quarterly statements and yearly interest statements (at paras 13 and 16) and that 
I see no reason at all for the defendants not to have adopted and followed the standard procedure with regard to the generating and mailing of the various statements of account to the plaintiff at all material times (at para 17).
 49.Her evidence is that in the normal course of business such statements would be collected by the Singapore Post for mailing but she stopped short of saying that the statements in question were in fact collected for mailing, or stating when each collection was made. There were some computer-generated Volume Reports (DSB1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13) which she said were check-lists for documents sent out (notes of evidence p135A). She explained that crosses were marked on a check-list by the mailing room operators when they have completed their jobs (notes of evidence p 136A) and that ticks were marked on another check-list to indicate that the documents have been sent out (notes of evidence p 136B). The appearance of a tick and two crosses on one check-list (DSB7) also indicates that they represent different things.
 50.Looking at the check-lists produced, there were no crosses or ticks on the first check-list (DSB1) and the second check-list (DSB3), no ticks on the third check-list (DSB5), no cross on the relevant part of the fourth check-list (DSB7, third box from top), no crosses or ticks on the fifth check-list (DSB9), no cross on the relevant portion of the sixth check-list (DSB11, third box from top) and no crosses or ticks on the seventh check-list (DSB13). If, as Ms Tan explained crosses signify the completion of processing and ticks signify collection, then when one lot of statements is processed and collected the check-list should be marked with a tick as well as a cross. The entries in the check-lists relating to the statements in question were either unmarked or marked with a cross or a tick, but no entry was marked with a cross and a tick, and none of the markings was dated.
 51.I find that Ms Tan has not explained satisfactorily how statements were processed and collected for mailing. The persons who dealt with the statements and made the crosses and ticks should be the ones to explain the check-lists. Her evidence is not acceptable as proof of posting of the statements in question.
 52.Leong Chow Yuet mentioned in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief that quarterly statements of accounts and the yearly interest statement for 1995 were mailed to the mailing address in Japan (paras 15-17). Ms Leong did not state whether she believed or knew of those matters, nor did she disclose the basis and source of her belief or knowledge. Her evidence is as unacceptable as Ms Tan`s evidence.
 53.The defendants have failed to prove that the statements were posted. The presumption of receipt does not arise, and following from that there is no presumption under cl 7(b)(iii)(bb) that the statements were correct.
 54.
 Conclusion
The defendants acted without the plaintiff`s mandate when they debited the account. By so doing they could be liable to the plaintiff. However, the parties have contracted that they will only be liable for losses resulting from their fault. As they were not at fault for being deceived by the forged signature, they are not liable for the loss that followed. In the circumstances, the plaintiff`s action is dismissed with costs.",1998-03-27 00:00:00,SG High Court

LP THEAN JA
 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The appellants, Lee Teck Wah (Lee) and Abdul Rahim bin Ibrahim (Rahim), together with one Mohamed Hassan bin Abdul Kader (Hassan), were jointly tried before the High Court on charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1997 Ed) (the Act). Hassan was charged with trafficking in a quantity of not less than 585.1g of diamorphine on 11 March 1997 by transporting it from River View Hotel at Havelock Road to the junction of Tampines Avenue 2 and Tampines Street 23, an offence under s 5(1)(a) and punishable under s 33 of the Act. Lee and Rahim were jointly charged with abetting Hassan by each engaging with Hassan in a conspiracy to traffic in that quantity of diamorphine, such conspiracy being alleged to have been committed between 6 March 1997 and 11 March 1997, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 12 and punishable under s 33 of the Act.
 2.At the commencement of the trial, Hassan pleaded guilty to the charge against him but the High Court rejected his plea and directed the prosecution to prove its case against him. At the close of the case for the prosecution, Hassan was asked by the trial judge whether he still wished to maintain his plea of guilty and he replied in the affirmative. He was then reminded of the consequence of his plea and was asked whether he accepted the evidence that had been adduced. He said he accepted the evidence relating to him only, but that there was some evidence which was not true, and he went on to make statements which sought to exculpate Lee and Rahim. The learned judge in the end did not accept his plea of guilty on the ground that it was equivocal and called upon him to enter on his defence. He elected to remain silent and did not adduce any evidence in his defence. Lee and Rahim claimed trial, and when their defence was called, they gave evidence in their defence. At the conclusion of the trial, all the three accused were found guilty and were convicted of the charges against them and were sentenced to death. Only Lee and Rahim appealed against their convictions and sentences. We dismissed their appeals and now give our reasons.
 3.
 The prosecution case
The evidence adduced by the prosecution was as follows. On 11 March 1997, a team of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) under the direction of Insp Paul Ang kept a surveillance on Hassan. After trailing him from his residence at Block 90, Pipit Road, #07-137, S/Sgt Lek Siang Heng, NO Ler Puay Soon, Sgt Lim Puay Boon, NO David Ng and NO Wee Thiam Poh observed Hassan walking towards the driveway of River View Hotel at Havelock Road. He was not carrying anything. That was about 8.30am. S/Sgt Lek and NO Ler Puay Soon also observed that Lee appeared at the driveway of the hotel and tapped Hassan on the shoulder. The two of them engaged in a conversation and they walked into the hotel. NO Ler then saw Hassan and Lee entering the exit at the hotel lobby leading to the basement carpark. About five minutes later, they were seen leaving the hotel in a motorcar bearing the number WEM 6609 with Lee as the driver. But at the driveway, Hassan alighted from the car with a black travelling bag and walked towards the taxi stand at the hotel entrance.
 4.At the taxi stand, Hassan approached the taxi bearing the number SHA 7587C. He knocked on the boot of the taxi and when it was opened, he placed the black travelling bag into the boot. He then boarded the taxi and directed the taxi-driver to drive to Tampines. The taxi was trailed by CNB officers. At the junction of Tampines Avenue 2 and Tampines Street 23, the taxi was intercepted by the CNB officers. Hassan was arrested and the bag was recovered from the boot. He initially resisted the arrest but was eventually subdued and handcuffed. The bag was found to contain 20 wrapped packages. The contents of these packages were subsequently analysed and found to contain not less than 581.5g of diamorphine, the subject matter of the charge against him.
 5.After his arrest, Hassan led the CNB officers to a flat rented by him at Block 486B Tampines Avenue 9 #05-56, where eight sachets of vegetable matter and drug trafficking paraphernalia were recovered. Three digital weighing scales, four stacks of new plastic bags, empty plastic sachets, a stack of white envelopes and candles, and a box of iron weights were seized. The digital scales were stained with diamorphine. His residence at Block 90, Pipit Road, #07-137 was also searched by CNB officers and they recovered a POSB account book bearing the account No 183-09655-9 in the name of Rahim (the second appellant). The prosecution led evidence to show that the plastic sachet of vegetable matter contained 38.4g of cannabis and 28.5g of cannabis mixture.

 Lee`s arrest
Lee was arrested in the same morning at about 11.05am at the hotel`s basement carpark. A search was conducted on him and, among other things, four $10,000 notes bearing serial numbers AA 166598, AA 179522, AA 071836 and AA 216237 were found on him. When Lee was arrested, he was questioned by Insp Chow Toong Chee regarding the large sum of money, and he replied that he had come to Singapore to collect the money. The defence did not challenge the making of this statement.
 7.Lee after his arrest made two long statements under s 121 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) on 17 and 18 March 1997 respectively. The s 122(6) statement was made on 11 March 1997. The combined effect of all the statements was as follows: (a). On 10 March 1997, Lee came to Singapore to visit his divorced wife named Phang Mook Lan who mentioned that she wanted to work at the Kimberly night club in Singapore. He had been behind in paying the monthly maintenance for his four year old son.
 (b). After he had checked into the River View Hotel, he called his ex-wife`s mother to ask how he could contact his ex-wife but received no help from her.
 (c). On the morning of 11 March 1997, he wanted to take a taxi to Changi Airport but there was a long queue at the taxi stand. He decided instead to drive to Newton Hawker Centre for a meal.
 (d). He then went to the hotel basement to collect his car. As he was going from the first basement to the second basement, he accidentally caused a door to knock into a male Chinese. The man fell, got up and walked hurriedly away. Lee noticed a white envelop on the floor. He picked it up, opened it, and found a stack of Singapore dollar notes in it. He kept the envelop in his trouser pocket and continued his way to the second basement.
 (e). As he reached his car, an elderly Malay man asked him in Malay if he could have a lift to the hotel taxi-stand. He obliged the old man, who got into the car. After they had moved a short distance, the man asked him to stop the car for him to collect his luggage. He obliged him again, and the old man collected a bag and placed it in the rear seat of the car.
 (f). When they reached the hotel entrance, the Malay man gathered his bag from the back seat, hailed a taxi and got into it.
 (g). Lee continued his way to Newton Hawker Centre where he had his meal. After the meal he returned to his car, took out the white envelop, and counted the money in it. There was a sum of $49,000 comprising four $10,000 notes and nine $1,000 notes. He returned to his hotel room with the money, undecided whether to keep it or to report to the police.
 (h). At 11am, he checked out of his hotel room. On his way to the car, he was arrested. The money was seized.
 (i). From the photographs of Hassan and Rahim, he identified Hassan as the elderly Malay man who asked him for the lift. He did not know his name and had not met or spoken to him before. He did not know the contents of the bag Hassan was carrying and thought it contained only clothings.
 8.
 Rahim`s arrest
Rahim was arrested on 11 March 1997 at about 6.35pm at Block 436, Tampines Street 43, #02-111. Soon after his arrest, two long statements under s 121 of the CPC were recorded from him: one on 12 March 1997, and the other on 21 March 1997. He made a statement under s 122(6) of the CPC also on 12 March 1997. The first statement of 12 March 1997 was recorded by ASP William Chew Khai Chow with the assistance of the interpreter Sofia bte Sufri. The admissibility of this statement was disputed on the ground that it was made as a result of improper threats made to him by ASP Vijakumar and Sgt Riduan, the interrogating officers, as well as oppression by the rest of the CNB officers in refusing to give him food or drink from the time of his arrest to the time he made the statement. ASP Vijakumar and Sgt Riduan allegedly threatened him that they would arrest his wife, if he did not give the statement they wanted. The other reason why he gave the statement to ASP William Chew was that he was exhausted, both mentally and physically.
 9.The learned judge held a voire dire, and at the conclusion, he found that the statement was made voluntarily. Accordingly, the statement was admitted in evidence.
 10.In the statement made on 12 March 1997, he said as follows: (a). On 6 March 1997, Hassan told him that he needed $60,000 to buy 20 pounds of heroin for resale, and that he (Rahim) would receive $10,000 as his share of the profits when the heroin was resold.
 (b). On 8 March 1997, Hassan informed him that the heroin was to be delivered on 11 March and he would collect the $60,000 on 10 March 1997.
 (c). On 10 March 1997, Rahim withdrew $60,000 from the POSB account at the Bras Basah Road branch in the following denominations: five $10,000 notes and ten $1,000 notes. He handed the whole sum to Hassan together with his POSB pass book so that the latter could bank the cost of the heroin and profits directly into his account.
 11.In his s 122(6) statement, he said that he was not aware that Hassan was transporting the heroin in a taxi that day. He was working on 11 March 1997 and was not with Hassan. In the second long statement of 21 March 1997, he said, among other things, that he knew that Hassan was a gambler and had borrowed large sums of money from him on two occasions.
 12.
 Evidence on $10,000 notes
Ng Siew Tang, the bank teller at the Bras Basah Road branch of POSB, testified that on 10 March 1997, sometime in the afternoon while she was on duty, a male Malay came to her counter and withdrew $60,000 from his account. The male Malay wanted $50,000 in five $10,000 notes and the balance in smaller denominations. She issued the five $10,000 notes and wrote down the serial numbers of the five $10,000 notes, namely AA 166598, AA 179522, AA 071836, AA 216237 and AA 137262, on the reverse side of the withdrawal slip and thereafter handed the money to the male Malay. Four of these notes bore the same serial numbers respectively as the four $10,000 notes found on Lee when he was arrested.
 13.It was the prosecution`s case that Rahim conspired with Hassan and that it was part of their conspiracy that he (Rahim) was to provide finance for the drug deal, and that Lee conspired with Hassan to supply the drugs to Hassan. In furtherance of such conspiracy Rahim gave at least four of the $10,000 notes to Hassan, who in turn used them to pay Lee for the drugs.
 14.
 Lee`s defence
Lee gave evidence in his defence. He stated that there was an entirely innocent explanation for his acts. He said that he was in Singapore to meet his ex-wife and that he was behind in his alimony payments. He claimed that it was entirely coincidental that he spoke to a male Malay at the taxi stand of the River View Hotel and that was with reference to the question whether a taxi was available. He claimed that Hassan was only in his car because the latter asked for a lift. He had absolutely no idea what was in Hassan`s luggage.
 15.Lee said that he came into possession of the four $10,000 notes because they were dropped by a Chinese gentleman at the hotel`s basement carpark and he picked them up. The notes were in an envelop which contained a sum of $49,000 comprising the four $10,000 notes and the rest in other dominations. He maintained that what he said in his long statements and his s 122(6) statement was true. In his examination-in-chief, he resiled from his statement made on arrest that he came to Singapore to collect money and said that he did not want to disclose to Insp Chow that he in fact found the money. There was no drug trafficking paraphernalia found when searches were conducted at the hotel where he had stayed the night before and in the car WEM 6609.
 16.
 Rahim`s defence
Rahim also gave evidence in his defence. It was his defence that he lent $60,000 to Hassan for the latter`s money-lending business. Hassan had promised him a profit of 10% for a two-month loan. He had no idea that it was to be used to purchase drugs. He had never entered into any conspiracy with Hassan for making profits out of drug trafficking activities. The POSB passbook found in Hassan`s flat bearing his name was given to Hassan so that the latter could bank directly into his account the money which he had loaned.
 17.The passbook showed that there were two deposits of $7,000 and $4,000 credited to the bank account on 10 March 1997, the very day when he withdrew the $60,000. He said that these deposits were made by Hassan in part payment of the loan to him.
 18.He renounced his s 121 statement made on 12 March 1997 as untrue, and said that he had signed it because of the threats that he received from the CNB officers, his own hunger due to the lack of food provided, and his sheer mental and physical exhaustion.
 19.
 Decision below
The learned trial judge found that the case against Hassan was not disputed. There was clear evidence of his guilt: he was in possession of the travelling bag containing the diamorphine and was travelling from River View Hotel to the junction of Tampines Avenue 2 and Tampines Street 23 where he was arrested. He had not rebutted the presumption that he was trafficking in the quantity of diamorphine in his possession.
 20.As against Lee, the learned trial judge found that there was undisputed evidence from the CNB officers that he met and spoke to Hassan at the driveway of the hotel, and that they went into the hotel together, and at the hotel lobby they entered the exit leading to the hotel`s basement carpark. In addition, four of the $10,000 notes that Rahim gave to Hassan were found in his possession. The learned trial judge held that Rahim`s statement of 12 March 1997 that the money was intended for the purchase of heroin was admissible as against Lee. He did not believe Lee. He found that Lee`s explanation as to how he came into possession of the four $10,000 notes was completely incredible and that it contradicted the earlier explanation given by Lee to the arresting officer.
 21.With regard to Rahim, the learned judge found that Rahim had admitted his involvement in the conspiracy with Hassan to traffic in drugs in the s 121 statement which he made on 12 March 1997. There, he said that he was to provide $60,000 to Hassan to enable the latter to purchase drugs for the purpose of resale at a profit. The learned judge held that the fact that four of the $10,000 notes were found on Lee after Hassan had met with Lee and come into possession of the drugs corroborated the admissions Rahim made in his statement to ASP Chew. He rejected Rahim`s defence that the money was lent to Hassan to finance the latter`s money-lending business and found that there were several inconsistencies in his evidence.
 22.The learned judge did not believe Rahim that the statement was made because of some threat from the CNB officers. He did not believe that Sgt Riduan and ASP Vijakumar made any threat to him. In any event, when the statement was recorded by ASP William Chew with the assistance of the interpreter, neither of them was hostile to him, and neither Sgt Riduan nor ASP Vijakumar was present when the statement was recorded. The failure by the CNB officers to provide him with dinner since his arrest did not weaken his free will to make a statement which he could not have made otherwise.
 23.The learned judge found that the prosecution had proved its case against all the three accused beyond any reasonable doubt and he convicted them of the charges they each faced. Against the decision of the learned judge only Lee and Rahim appealed; no appeal was filed by Hassan.
 24.
 The appeal
The core of both the appeals was that the learned judge erred in allowing a joint trial of the appellants and Hassan. Before the learned judge, both counsel for the appellants at the outset objected to a joint trial and applied for the trial of Lee and Rahim to be separate from that of Hassan. That application was refused. At the close of the case for the prosecution, both counsel renewed their application. Again, the learned judge refused their application.
 25.We deal first with this question of the joint trial. The starting point is s 176 of the CPC, which, so far as material, is as follows: 
When more persons than one are accused of the same offence or of different offences committed in the same transaction, or of more than one offence falling within section 169 or when one person is accused of committing any offence and another of abetment of or attempt to commit that offence they may be charged and tried together or separately as the court thinks fit
 26.There was no dispute that the charges concerned offences committed in the same transaction falling within s 176. There were present here proximity of time, unity of purpose or design and continuity of action: see 
PP v Loh Ang Sing
 
 [1965] 2 MLJ 129 
, p 130, and 
Loh Shak Mow v PP
 
 [1987] 1 MLJ 363 
, p 381; 
[1986] SLR 358
, p 385. The charge against Hassan was that he trafficked in a quantity of not less than 585.1g of diamorphine on 11 March 1997. The charge against Lee and Rahim jointly was that they each abetted Hassan in the commission of that offence by each engaging in a conspiracy with him: Lee conspired with Hassan by delivering to Hassan the drugs in question and receiving from him $49,000 in payment for them on 11 March 1997, and Rahim conspired with Hassan by agreeing with Hassan to traffic in drugs and providing finance in the sum of $60,000 for the payment of the drugs on 10 March 1997. The separate acts of Lee, Rahim and Hassan were linked together in carrying out the drug transaction on 11 March 1997.
 27.Thus, on the basis of these charges against the three of them there is no question that they could be jointly tried under s 176 of the CPC. The main consideration was whether there was any prejudice to the two appellants in having a joint trial with Hassan. Counsel submitted that the joint trial was prejudicial to the appellants on the ground that Hassan had from the outset evinced an intention to remain silent and at the close of the prosecution`s case he elected to remain silent and not to give any evidence. Under s 122(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed), Hassan was a competent but not a compellable witness; he was not compellable to testify either for himself or for any person jointly charged with him and hence the appellants could not compel him to testify on their behalf. If the trial of Hassan had been separate from that of Lee and Rahim, Hassan would be a compellable witness in the defence of Rahim and Lee. Lee wanted to call Hassan to testify as to what transpired at the basement carpark of the River View Hotel; and Rahim wanted to call Hassan to support his evidence that there was no prior conspiracy to traffic in the drugs. Thus, as Hassan was not a compellable witness, the appellants were deprived of their right to a full and complete defence at the trial because they were precluded from calling their co-accused as a witness.
 28.It is convenient here to set out s 122(3) of the Evidence Act which is as follows: 
In any criminal proceedings, the accused shall be competent to give evidence on behalf of himself or any person jointly charged with him, but shall not be compellable to do so.
 Clearly, having regard to this provision, each of the three accused, Hassan, Lee and Rahim, was competent to give evidence on behalf of himself or his co-accused, but was not compellable to do so.
 29.In applying this provision, counsel relied on certain dicta in 
R v Richardson
 
[1967] 51 Cr App R 381
 and in 
R v Harbach
 
[1973] 6 SASR 427
 for the proposition that where an accused was deprived of the testimony of his co-accused by virtue of the fact that the latter elected to remain silent, it would always be necessary in such a case to order separate trials of the accused. We do not think that these cases support such a proposition.
 30.In 
 Richardson 
, H, M, R and others were jointly indicted on one of the counts, and at the commencement of the trial Lawton J ordered a separate trial for M. At the later stage of the joint trial of H, M and others, H applied for and obtained a witness summons against M whom he desired to call as a witness. The question then was whether M was a compellable witness. The learned judge held that M was a compellable witness. In the course of his judgment Lawton J referred to a decision of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved in 
R v Payne
 
[1872] LR 1 CCR 349
 where several men were jointly indicted for entering another person`s land while armed, and one of the defendants wanted to call another defendant to give evidence, and the question was whether he could do so. It was held that he could not. With reference to that case Lawton J said: 
The injustice of a situation in not being able to call a man jointly charged as a witness was duly pointed out to the court, whereupon Cockburn CJ said (at p 354) `The remedy for that is to apply to have the prisoners tried separately.` The Chief Justice seems to have thought that, if there were separate trials, the problem of calling one defendant in support of another could be overcome; but that is not this problem.
 It should be noted that 
 Richardson 
 was not concerned with the situation of a prejudice caused by the inability of an accused to call his co-accused to testify on his behalf. Rather the problem was whether an accomplice was a compellable witness at the instance of the accused, where the accomplice was tried separately from the accused.
 31.In 
 R v Harbach 
, two accused were jointly charged with murder and they applied for separate trials, but the application was refused by the trial judge. They appealed and the Supreme Court of South Australia held that the question of a joint trial was one for the discretion of the trial judge and that on the facts there was no reason to interfere with the trial judge`s exercise of his discretion. The court said obiter, at p 435: 
And, of course there may be other types of cases where an appellate court would hold the discretion to have been wrongly exercised. One instance which occurs to us is where one of the accused desires to call his co-accused to give evidence. In such a case, of course, it would probably be necessary for the case against the other accused to be dealt with first.
 32.Reverting to the case at hand, counsel sought to show the evidence which Hassan could and would give, if he were a compellable witness. They relied on Hassan`s brief unsworn statement which he made from the dock in the following circumstances. At the close of the prosecution`s case, the learned judge asked Hassan whether he accepted the prosecution`s evidence that was adduced. From the dock, Hassan said that he admitted the facts relating to him only, and he then made statements exculpating the appellants. He claimed that the money was lent to him by Rahim as a loan and he did not engage in any conspiracy with Rahim to traffic in drugs. With regard to Lee, he said that his meeting Lee at the River View Hotel was a pure coincidence.
 33.It seems to us that counsel for the appellants took the view that, where more than one accused are jointly tried and, at the close of the case for the prosecution, one of the accused elects to remain silent and not to give evidence in his defence, he cannot thereafter be called to give evidence for his co-accused. This, in our opinion, is erroneous. The election made at that stage is made with reference to his own defence only and cannot be taken by implication as an election by him not to give evidence for his co-accused, when called upon to do so. In our opinion, in a joint trial of two or more accused, an election made by one accused at the close of the case for the prosecution to remain silent and not to give evidence is made with reference to his defence only; it is not an election by him not to give evidence for his co-accused. Notwithstanding that election, he may still be called to give evidence as a witness for his co-accused. As and when he is called, he may then decide whether to give or refuse to give evidence for his co-accused. He is not compellable, and at that stage he may exercise his right to give or not to give evidence for his co-accused. If he agrees to give such evidence, then the court should, as a matter of caution, explain to him that he is not compellable to do so, but that if he does give evidence, he would be liable to be cross-examined as to his own involvement in the offence with which he is being charged.
 34.At this juncture, it is convenient to refer to two cases relied upon by counsel for Lee. The first is the case of 
Liew Sang v PP
 
[1948] MLJ 83
 . There, Lee and Liew were both charged with committing gang robbery with murder and also with abduction with intent to confine a person. At the close of the case for the prosecution, Lee elected to give evidence and Liew remained silent. Counsel for Lee called Liew as a witness and he gave evidence which was prejudicial to himself but which exonerated Lee. At the end of the trial Lee was acquitted and Liew was convicted. On appeal by Liew, the Court of Appeal of the Federation of Malaya held that it was not open to counsel for Lee to call him as a witness, and the court ordered a new trial. Pretheroe Ag CJ, who delivered the judgment of the court, referred to the first proviso of s 191 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 6, 1935 Ed) of the Federated Malay States (which was in substance same as s 190(3) of our CPC) and said, at p 84: 
The first proviso to this section makes it abundantly clear that an accused person has the right to decide whether or not he will be a witness in the case, and consequently, unless he so elects, he cannot be `called` as a witness by, or on behalf of, anyone. Although he had elected to say nothing there is nothing in the record to indicate that he was warned that if he gave evidence on behalf of the first accused, he was liable to be cross-examined generally as to his own participation in the crime, and both Mr Conaghan and counsel for the respondent (who were the counsel at the trial) assured the court that no such warning was in fact given. In the event his evidence, if believed, completely exonerated the first accused, but his answer to the first question in cross-examination was `I took part in the ambush with ten others`. It need scarcely be added that this answer was prejudicial to the second accused to the highest degree, and at the end of the trial, the first accused was acquitted on both counts, but second accused was found guilty on both counts. In our opinion, as the second accused had validly exercised his right neither to give evidence nor make a statement, it was not open to counsel to call him as a witness for first accused.
 35.With respect, we do see why Liew, having elected to remain silent, when called upon to enter on his defence, could not subsequently be called to give evidence for Lee. His election to remain silent and not give evidence was made in relation to his own defence. Even if Liew was not a compellable witness, he was, as far as we can see, a competent witness and unless he declined to give evidence for Lee, he could be called by Lee to give evidence. The learned Chief Justice did not give any reason or authority in support of this pronouncement. The Evidence Enactment (Cap 10, 1935 Ed) of the Federated Malay States, then in force, did not have a provision similar to or identical with s 122(3) of our Evidence Act. The corresponding provision there was s 120(3), which was in the following terms: 
In criminal trials and in enquiries under Chapter XVII of the Criminal Procedure Code the accused shall be a competent witness in his own behalf, and may give evidence in the same manner and with the like effect and consequences as any other witness, provided that, so far as the cross-examination relates to the credit of the accused, the court may limit the cross-examination to such extent as it thinks proper, although the proposed cross-examination might be permissible in the case of any other witness.
 36.The next case is 
Goh Ah San v R
 
[1938] MLJ 95
 . There, three accused were jointly charged with importation of chandu under s 12 of the Chandu Revenue Ordinance (Cap 223, 1936 Ed) and were convicted. At the close of the case for the prosecution, the first accused elected to remain silent and not to give evidence. However, he made a certain statement with reference to the charge which the trial judge did not accept as a plea of guilty. On appeal it was argued, inter alia, that the trial judge should have accepted his plea so that the other two accused could call him as a witness. McElwine CJ did not accept this argument, and he held that the trial judge did not exercise his discretion wrongly in not adopting this course. However, in disposing of this argument the learned Chief Justice made the following observation at p 99: 
A person in the position of No. 1 accused could not properly be called as a witness for the defence until he had been either acquitted or convicted and sentenced. Section 39 of Cap 223 contains special provisions for calling a co-accused as a Crown Witness.
 37.With respect, we do not see why the first accused could not properly be called as a witness for the defence of the second and third accused, unless he declined to be called. Again, the Evidence Ordinance (Cap 13, 1936 Ed) of the Straits Settlement, then in force, did not have a provision similar to or identical with s 122(3) of the Evidence Act. The corresponding provision there was s 121(3) which was substantially identical with s 120(3) of the Federated Malay States Evidence Enactment which we have quoted above.
 38.It is relevant to mention here that the present sub-s (3) of s 122 of our Evidence Act was introduced by the Evidence (Amendment) Act 1976, and it replaced sub-section (3) of the then s 120. The replaced sub-s (3) was substantially identical with s 120(3) of the Federated Malay States Evidence Enactment (Cap 10, 1935 Ed) which we have quoted above.
 39.We now revert to the facts in the instant case. On a close examination of the record of proceedings it did not appear that Lee or Rahim had been deprived of the evidence of Hassan in the way as claimed by their counsel. We found that at no stage of the proceedings had Hassan refused to give evidence for either Lee or Rahim. On the contrary, the statement he made from the dock seeking to exculpate them was a strong indication that he would be prepared to give evidence as their witness, if he was called. The fact was that he was never called by either of them. Counsel for the appellants appeared to have formed the impression that Hassan declined to give evidence for Lee or Rahim on the basis that Hassan, when called upon to enter on his defence, elected to remain silent and not to give evidence. That election by Hassan, however, must be understood in the proper context; it was an election made by him in response to the two courses available to him in his defence that were put to him by the learned judge, when he was called upon to enter on his defence. It is clear to us that his election to remain silent and not to give evidence was made with reference only to giving 
 evidence in his own defence. 
 That election certainly was not an election not to give evidence for Lee or Rahim. At no stage of the proceedings had Hassan given an indication to the court that he would decline to give evidence for Lee or Rahim, if called upon to do so. On the basis what had transpired the inference is that Hassan was only too willing to testify for Lee and Rahim, and it seems to us that both counsel had misunderstood the stand he took.
 40.In the event, neither counsel called upon Hassan to give evidence for his co-accused. In closing his case, counsel for Lee informed the court that if he had `the opportunity` he would have called Hassan as a witness but as the matters stood he could not do so. However, counsel had never called Hassan and the latter had never indicated that he would not give evidence for Lee. It seems to us that counsel had `the opportunity`. The same error was made by counsel for Rahim at the close of the case: he said he would also like to call Hassan but he could not do so.
 41.Lastly, counsel for Lee raised the additional argument that at the close of the case for the prosecution, the learned judge should have accepted Hassan`s plea of guilty, as he had admitted to the facts material to the charge against him. This argument has no merit. The learned judge at that stage found that the plea of Hassan was somewhat equivocal and refused to accept that plea. In fact, counsel for Hassan indicated to the learned judge that Hassan`s plea was a `qualified one`. In our judgment, the learned judge was right in not accepting Hassan`s plea.
 42.
 Evidence against Lee
The evidence against Lee was circumstantial. There was the evidence of S/Sgt Lek Siang Heng and NO Ler Puay Soon who kept a surveillance on Hassan and who observed that Hassan met Lee at the driveway of River View Hotel in the morning at about 8.30am. Lee was seen by the officers talking to Hassan at or near the taxi stand and both of them were seen entering the hotel. At the hotel lobby, NO Ler saw them entering the exit leading to the basement carpark. Sgt Lek and NO Ler testified that Hassan was not carrying anything when he entered the hotel with Lee. Both Lee and Hassan were seen coming out from the hotel car park in the car WEM 6609 driven by Lee. Hassan was seen alighting from the car, and at that time, carrying the black travelling bag which was later found to contain the heroin. The learned judge found that Lee`s story that he met Hassan by chance at the carpark was incredible, and he rejected Lee`s evidence. The learned judge was justified in so doing.
 43.The most damning evidence against Lee was the four $10,000 notes bearing the serial numbers AA 166598, AA 179522, AA 071836 and AA 216237 which were found on him on his arrest. The serial numbers of these notes matched those of four of the five $10,000 notes which were issued to Rahim when he withdrew $60,000 from his account at Bras Bash Road branch of the POSB on 10 March 1997. Rahim admitted in his s 121 statement that on 10 March 1997 he withdrew from his POSB account the sum of $60,000, comprising the five $10,000 notes and ten $1,000 notes, and he gave the entire sum to Hassan. Four of these very same $10,000 notes were found on Lee, and they must have come from Hassan who paid him in exchange for the drugs, especially when the notes were found on him after he had met Hassan and the latter had emerged from the car driven by Lee carrying a bag that was found to contain heroin. All these showed irresistibly that the parties were in concert in the pursuit of a common object, ie trafficking in drugs. There was ample evidence to support the learned judge`s finding that the charge against Lee was proved.
 44.Lee`s explanation as to how he came into possession of the four incriminating $10,000 notes was found by the learned judge to be incredible. Lee claimed that it was entirely coincidental that he picked up the sum of $49,000 which was contained in an envelop that was dropped in the basement carpark. When Lee was arrested and was questioned by Insp Chow Toong Chee regarding the large sum of money, Lee replied that he had come to Singapore to collect money. His making of this statement was not challenged by his counsel. However, this statement was inconsistent with his long statement of 18 March 1997, where he gave a differently story, viz. that he picked up an envelop containing the $49,000 at the hotel basement car-park. His explanation at the trial as to the inconsistency was itself contradictory. In his examination in chief, his explanation was that he did not want to disclose the fact that he found the money. However, in cross-examination, he claimed that he was never asked by Insp Chow as to the large sum of money found on him. The learned judge rejected his evidence that he picked up the sum of money at the hotel basement carpark. The learned judge also disbelieved Lee`s testimony that he came to Singapore for the purpose of looking for his former wife. On the evidence before him, the learned judge was fully justified in rejecting the testimony of Lee.
 45.
 Evidence against Rahim
Against Rahim, the prosecution relied primarily on the s 121 statement made by him to ASP William Chew on 12 March 1997 as well as the POSB passbook bearing his name that was found in Hassan`s flat. His appeal was directed mainly on the admissibility of the s 121 statement. Counsel for Rahim argued that the learned judge erred in holding that the statement to ASP Chew Chai Chow was made voluntarily.
 46.At the voire dire, the evidence of Rahim was that after his arrest on 11 March 1997, at about 6.35pm, he was interrogated repeatedly at the CNB by ASP Vijakumar and Sgt Riduan from about 10pm to 11.40pm. They told him that Hassan had been arrested with 20 pounds of heroin and accused him of being the mastermind and that his bank account book was found in Hassan`s residence. He denied his involvement repeatedly, but the two officers did not believe him. ASP Vijakumar allegedly warned him thus: `If you do not make a statement admitting that you are guilty, then you will face it. We will know what to do with you later`. Sgt Riduan threatened him by saying: `If you don`t admit and waste our time, we will have to take your wife, put her in the lock-up and question her also`. When he heard that, he became afraid for her because she was in a poor state of health and he had three young children who needed their mother. To save his wife, he decided to make a false statement. In addition, he was exhausted both mentally and physically. He was not given any food or drink since his arrest to the time the statement was recorded. On 12 March 1997, between 12.20am and 3.28am, the statement was eventually recorded by ASP Chew Chai Chow with the assistance of the interpreter Sofia bte Sufri. Rahim said that he made a false statement because he was afraid that he would be sent to ASP Vijakumar and Sgt Riduan to be tortured.
 47.Whether a statement was voluntarily made is a question of fact: 
Tan Boon Tat v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 1
 ; 
DPP v Ping Lin
 
[1976] AC 574
. The burden of proving that a statement has been voluntarily made lies with the prosecution, which must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt: 
Panya Martmontree v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 341
 . The learned judge found that the CNB officers did not threaten him that they would incarcerate his wife. He also found that ASP Vijakumar did not impliedly threaten to assault him and that Sgt Riduan only acted as an interpreter in the interview between ASP Vijakumar and Rahim. In cross-examination, he testified that he still felt afraid after completing the statement he gave to ASP Chew. This was not accepted by the learned judge, as there was no reason to feel afraid since ASP Chew did not administer any threats to him, and neither ASP Vijakumar nor Sgt Riduan were present when the statement was actually recorded. In these circumstances, the learned judge rejected the allegation of any threat, inducement and promise. He had the benefit of hearing and seeing Sgt Riduan, ASP Vijakumar, Sofia bte Sufri and ASP Chew giving evidence and he disbelieved Rahim. We could find no basis for disturbing his finding.
 48.Apart from the s 121 statement, the prosecution relied on the POSB passbook bearing Rahim`s name found in Hassan`s residence. Rahim`s defence was that he lent $60,000 to Hassan for the latter`s money-lending business. He had no idea that it was to be used to finance the drug purchase. The POSB passbook showed that there were two deposits of $7,000 and $4,000 made respectively to the bank account on 10 March 1997, the very day when he withdrew $60,000. He claimed that these deposits were made by Hassan in part payment of the loan.
 49.Rahim explained that the POSB passbook was given to Hassan so that the latter could bank directly to his account the money, which he had loaned to Hassan. In his s 121 statement to SS/Sgt Cheong Wah Chow of 21 March 1997, he described it as a loan for a period of six weeks, yielding an interest at a rate between 5 and 10%. This statement was not only inconsistent with his statement of 12 March 1997 but also was inconsistent with his testimony in court. In cross-examination, he claimed that the sum was given to Hassan as a loan for a period of two months that would yield a 10% return. The period of the loan and the return from the loan differed from the s 121 statement.
 50.The learned judge held that the statement made on 12 March 1997 was true, and it was supported by the fact that four of the five $10,000 notes were found on Lee after Hassan had met with Lee and come into possession of the drugs. He disbelieved Rahim`s story that the money was given to Hassan as a loan for Hassan`s money-lending transaction, given that he could not remember the terms of the loan. Looking at the totality of the evidence, we found that the trial judge was justified in coming to this conclusion and we had no reason to disagree with him on this finding.
 51.In the result, we dismissed both the appeals.",1998-03-16 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 
 The charge
The appellant was convicted on the following charge: 
You, Aw Sei Kui, M/44 years, NRIC: 0104924-J are charged that you, on or about 11 January 1997, at about 5.05pm at No 33-D Surin Ave, Singapore, being the temporary occupier of the said premises, did use the said premises as a common betting house, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 3(1)(a) of the Betting Act (Cap 21).
 2.Section 3(1)(a) of the Betting Act (Cap 21) (the Act) reads as follows: 
Any person who being the owner or occupier, or having the use temporarily or otherwise thereof, keeps or uses a place as a common betting-house or betting information centre, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000 and shall also be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years.
 3.
 The facts
Briefly, the appellant was arrested after a raid on the property known as 33-D Surin Avenue, Singapore. The house was at the time leased to the appellant by a friend who had migrated to Australia. Numerous articles capable of association with illegal betting activities were also seized in the raid. Arrested together with the appellant was one Pua Ah Kow, who pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of betting or wagering in a common betting house or with a bookmaker in any place or by any means under s 5(1) of the Act.
 4.The prosecution`s case was that the appellant occupied and used the premises as a bookmaker. The defence was that he was merely a `punter` ie one who places (as opposes to takes) bets. Counsel for the appellant took issue with the prosecution`s view that s 3(1)(a) applied equally to `punters` and `bookmakers`, arguing that a `punter` could never be convicted of a s 3(1)(a) offence. The first question - the capacity in which the appellant betted - was a question of fact. The second question - whether s 3(1)(a) extended equally to `punters` - was a question of law. In this appeal against conviction and sentence, counsel for the appellant made submissions on the trial judge`s findings on both questions.
 5.
 The presumptions against the appellant
The starting point is that at least two legal presumptions were triggered against the appellant. The first was under s 9(2)(a) and (c) of the Act which provides that where either any document or thing designed, adapted, or intended for use or used for the purpose of betting or wagering is found in any place, or if two or more telephone calls are received at that place relating to the receiving or negotiating of bets or wagers or the results, commentary or dividends payable on any horse-race or other sporting event, that place is presumed to be a common betting house. The prosecution adduced evidence that the conditions of both (alternative) limbs were satisfied.
 6.Once it is presumed that the premises are used as a common betting house, this works in conjunction with s 5(2) of the Act, under which it is presumed that 
A person found in a common betting-house, or found escaping therefrom on the occasion of its being entered under this Act shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be or have been betting or wagering therein.
 This was the case as regards the appellant, who was apprehended fleeing from the premises.
 7.It was argued by counsel that the two presumptions could not be made to operate in tandem - that the second presumption could not be triggered by virtue of the first. His argument was that, in order for the second presumption to be activated, the triggering fact - that the premises were used as a common betting house - had to be proved by evidence, and not deemed proved by statute. This is a line of argument which was tested - and rejected - in respect of legal presumptions under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). Although the multiple triggering of presumptions in that Act has now been qualified by legislative amendments in 1993, no similar prohibitions exist in the Act. I was therefore of the view that short of express provisions dictating otherwise, there is nothing to prevent the presumptions from triggering one another in turn. In other words, unless the triggering fact is required by the statute to be `proved`, it suffices that the triggering fact is presumed. Section 5(2) does not state that the presumption is contingent on the person being `found in 
 a place proved to be 
 a common betting-house` (italics my words). As such, counsel`s objection - that the triggering fact had to be proved by evidence and not just presumed - could not stand.
 8.In any event, whether the presumption of the fact that the appellant was betting or wagering in the premises was or was not triggered was of no consequence in this appeal as the defence - that the appellant should have been convicted of the lesser s 5(1) offence - already contained an implied admission of that fact.
 9.A third presumption was not highlighted in the court below, which is that under s 8(1) and (2) - that any person accepting or receiving bets, stakes or wagers, or found in the possession of any [articles] used in connection with the business of a bookmaker or who settles or pays money or money`s worth in respect of bets or wagers relating to a horse-race or any other kind of race shall be presumed until the contrary is proved to be acting as a bookmaker.
 10.The appellant - who claimed that he was not a bookmaker, and that the 33-D Surin Ave premises were not used as a common betting house, had to rebut these presumptions by satisfying the court on a balance of probabilities that the position was otherwise.
 11.
 Whether the appellant was bookmaker
The case in the court below turned on whether the physical evidence found at the scene preferred the prosecution`s case or the defence. The prosecution relied on the evidence of an expert witness, one Sgt Yu Chong Heng, a member of the Gambling Suppression Branch of the CID (who was not involved in the raid) and his analysis of the items seized in the raid. These included: (i). two pieces of paper with entries marked PE-17 and PE-18;
 (ii). two pieces of paper with entries marked PE-13;
 (iii). a piece of paper with entries marked PE-12;
 (iv). a telephone call form regarding calls monitored by Sgt Shong Lai Hock marked P4;
 (v). A telephone call form regarding calls monitored by Sgt Thum Wai Tuck marked P5.
 12.Sgts Shong and Thum were members of the raiding party. They gave evidence of the events before, during and after the raid. They also gave evidence that after the appellant was arrested, several telephone calls were received at the premises, the callers ostensibly providing results of races or asking after results. These were the records marked P4 and P5.
 13.Of particular prominence in Sgt Yu`s evidence was exh PE-17. This was a scrap of paper which on one side bore four columns entitled `Sam`, `A`, `Ng` and `R` and on the flip side bore three columns entitled `Lan`, `David` and `Teck`. The prosecution`s case was that the seven names were names of punters who placed bets with the appellant - and that PE-17 was a record sheet of bets placed. According to the appellant, however, the first four names were names of bookmakers with whom he had placed bets, and the last three names were friends on whose behalf he had placed bets with the aforesaid bookmakers. He stated that he provided this `service` free of charge. Based on this explanation of PE-17, the appellant contended that he was not a bookmaker, but only a `punter` - that he placed bets with four different bookmakers, and also placed bets on behalf of his friends.
 14.Sgt Yu perused the items seized at the raid and concluded that a person connected to exhs P4, P5, PE 13, PE 17 and PE 18 (namely, the appellant) was a bookmaker. Sgt Yu identified several bases on which to refute the appellant`s explanation of PE-17. He said that the pattern of the bets reflected on the PE-17 betting sheet was inconsistent with bets placed by a punter.
 15.Firstly, he said, it was unheard of for a single punter to use four bookmakers. So, he said, it was unlikely that the appellant was placing bets with four different persons. Rather, it was more likely the case that the appellant was taking bets from all seven persons listed on both sides of PE-17.
 16.Secondly, he stated that it was unusual for a single punter to place bets for the same horse with two or more different bookmakers - the appellant alleged that he had placed 200 win and 200 place bets for the fourth horse in the third race with `Sam` and a further 250 win and 250 place bets for the same horse in the same race with `Aunty`. Sgt Yu said it was far more common for 450 bets to be placed with a single bookmaker. This was not the only instance. Bets on horse 13 in race 2 were placed with `Sam`, `Aunty` and `Robert`, and bets on horse 3 in race 2 placed with `Sam` and `Aunty`. Multiple bookmakers were also used for bets placed on horses 4 and 11 in race 2, horses 3 and 7 in race 4, and horse 7 in race 1.
 17.In its totality, this strongly suggested that the appellant was 
 receiving 
 rather than 
 placing 
 bets. No acceptable explanation was offered for this unusual betting pattern - why would the appellant choose to spread out his bets over a number of bookmakers? The appellant had suggested that he had been forced to place his bets with more than one bookmaker because the first bookmaker would not take more than a certain number of bets. For example, in respect of horse 4 in race 3, `Sam` would not take more than 200 bets, so he placed a further 250 bets with `Aunty`. In refuting this, Sgt Yu pointed out that `Sam` had accepted 300 bets in respect of the first horse in race 6, so he could not have a 200 bet limit. Furthermore, the appellant`s explanation did not patch all the discrepancies.
 18.The appellant then suggested that the odds on a given horse would also influence the maximum number of bets taken. To rebut this, Sgt Yu suggested that the difference in payout between the two different horses being only $1, this would not suffice to influence a bookmaker to limit bets taken at 200. I think the learned magistrate committed no error in accepting this explanation. Furthermore, in some cases, the number of bets placed was as small as 50. These bets could not have been explained away by the same reasoning. In this light, the exculpatory force of the appellant`s explanation withered away, leaving intact the incriminating effect of Sgt Yu`s expert testimony.
 19.Thirdly, said Sgt Yu, it was illogical to place four bets on four different horses in the same race. PE-17 showed that bets had been placed on horses 13, 11, 10 and 2 in race 2. This, he explained, greatly diminished the chances of making a profit - the total number of tickets was 650 `win` and 650 `place` amounting to $5,330. However, the return dividends he would receive was only $4,940, resulting in a net loss of $350. Similarly, betting on three horses in race 6 would result in a net loss of $2,164. It was therefore unlikely that the appellant was placing bets. The only way he could have made money from this betting pattern was if he was accepting (not placing) bets - converting the net losses into net gains by exchanging positions with the `bookmaker`. The appellant`s explanation - that he had initially placed bets on horses 13 and 11 in race 2 only to receive fresh tips that two other horses (10 and 2) were favoured to place - did not hold water. This was particularly so in light of the fact that this required the court to believe that he also intentionally adopted this loss-making approach to races 6 and 4 (in which bets were placed on three different horses with three different bookmakers). That this `suicide` pattern was that of a man who by his own admission had many years of betting experience was simply not consistent with his defence.
 20.Furthermore, having examined the bets allegedly placed by the appellants` `friends` on the obverse side of PE-17, Sgt Yu noted that although the appellants` friends had placed a total of 130 `win` and 130 `place` bets on horse 12 in race 5, he himself had only placed 100 `win` and 100 `place` bets with the bookmakers. Thus, his betting on his friends` behalf fell 30 bets short. This was also the case as regards the 10 `win` and 10 `place` bets on horse 3 in race 7 placed by `Lan` and the 50 `win` and 50 `place` bets on horse 1 in race 4 placed by `David`. These bets were not even placed with bookmakers. The irresistible inference to be drawn was that the appellant was not betting on his friends` behalf, but was taking bets from them.
 21.One question raised was why his friends did not simply place the bets directly with the bookmakers themselves? No good explanation was offered. Secondly, the appellants` explanation of these omissions - that he had, in the heat of the moment, forgotten to place these bets - lacked credibility. It defied logic that the appellants` friends would be happy to entrust their betting with him - having made three omissions out of a total of nine bets placed by them. Surely with a 33% failure rate, the appellants` friends would have found a more reliable agent.
 22.The appellant had explained in his defence that, if the bookmakers did not make good on bets, he would pay his friends out of his own pocket, and that, similarly, he would make good their losses to the bookmakers in the event these were asked for. It was not difficult to draw the inference that the appellant would similarly have no hesitation to pay out to his friends in respect of those bets they had placed with him but he had forgotten to place with the bookmakers. Obviously, however, doing so would have made the appellant himself a bookmaker in respect of those bets, with the consequence that the appeal on the facts could not stand.
 23.Viewing the evidence as a whole, I noted that the appellant had come up with some manner of explanation for almost every discrepancy highlighted by the prosecution`s expert. Had there been a single discrepancy or two, I might have been minded to consider the possibility that the defence was true. However, the evidence as a whole revealed that, if the appellant indeed was a punter, bad betting strategies, an unconventional betting methodology, and plain forgetfulness in placing bets he was asked by his friends to place was more the rule than the exception. Bearing in mind furthermore that it did not suffice for the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt as to the capacity in which he betted, but that he had to rebut the presumption that he was a bookmaker on a balance of probabilities, I was of the view that the learned magistrate did not err in concluding in favour of the prosecution on the question of fact.
 24.The appellant called three witnesses, two of whom claimed to be the `bookmakers` and one of the `friends` named in PE-17. Those who claimed to be bookmakers said that the appellant had indeed placed bets with them on the day in question, but that the records of those bets had now been destroyed. Both `bookmakers` also stated that they had, in their experience, known of punters to use three or more bookmakers on a single race day. They also said they would, on occasion, refuse to take bets beyond a certain limit, which would force punters to look for another bookmaker to place their bets with. His `friend` gave evidence that he had frequently placed bets with other bookmakers `through` the appellant. In view of the propensity of evidence rebutting this version of the facts and bearing in mind that the magistrate had the advantage of viewing the witnesses and of ascertaining their truthfulness, I was of the view that the magistrate had rightly rejected the explanations given by appellant and the evidence of the defence witnesses.
 25.There was in my view no basis to disturb the findings of fact of the lower court. The learned magistrate appeared in his grounds of judgment to have considered the evidence carefully and meticulously. The matters highlighted by Sgt Yu and accepted by the magistrate strongly suggested that the appellant was lying in his defence. I agreed with that conclusion. Further, I could find nothing in the physical evidence inconsistent with his rejection of the testimony of the appellant and the defence witnesses, the latter of whom, both by their own admission (ie on the defence`s version of facts) as well as on the case argued by the prosecution, were accomplices and whose evidence he was entitled to treat with caution under s 116, illustration (b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed).
 26.As the whole of the defence turned on the argument that the appellant was not a bookmaker but a punter, this was sufficient for me to dismiss the appeal. However, I will proceed to consider the arguments forwarded by the appellant`s counsel on the question of law.
 27.Before doing so, I find it necessary to comment on counsel`s submissions that the defence at trial was fairly consistent with the appellant`s long statement and the s 122(6) statement given on the day of his arrest. It is true that where the contents of the cautioned statement are inconsistent with the defence, an adverse inference may be drawn against the accused. But contrary to counsel`s suggestions, I did not think the converse was true - consistency at trial of his defence with his earlier statements did not necessarily substantially bolster his case. In any event, that defence was one which I considered unsustainable in light of the evidence.
 28.
 The appeal on a point of law
The starting point for the argument is s 3(1)(a). This section punishes occupiers of a `common betting-house`. A `common betting-house` is defined in s 2(1) as, (a) any place kept or used for betting or wagering on any event or contingency of or relating to any horse-race or other sporting event to which the public has access; (b) any place kept or used for habitual betting or wagering on any such event or contingency; or (c) used by any bookmaker for the purpose of receiving or negotiating bets or wagers.
 29.Limb (a) did not apply because the public did not have access to the premises.
 30.Naturally, the appellant having been found to be a bookmaker, his liability under limb (c) went without saying.
 31.However, assuming for argument`s sake that the appellant was not a bookmaker but was only a punter, what was to be made of counsel`s submission that limb (b) did not apply to his client even though he was betting on the premises? This conclusion was premised on the argument that there is an implied distinction in the Act between persons who `bet as punters` and those who `bet as bookmakers`. Although counsel accepted before the learned magistrate that there was, on a literal reading of the word `bet` in the Act, no such distinction, he argued that a purposive reading of the Act would necessitate the existence of such a distinction.
 32.He argued that, as a punter, his client should have been charged and convicted under s 5(1) of the Act, which punishes persons who bet or wager in a common betting-house, or with a bookmaker in any place or by any means. His case was that Parliament intended for s 5(1) to punish `punters` and for s 4 to punish the bookmakers` financiers and for ss 3 and 5(3) to punish the `bookmakers` and their accomplices. The applicable sentences increase in severity for `punters`, `financiers` and `bookmakers`, respectively. As, he said, his client was only a `punter`, he could only be punished under s 5(1) ie, with the lightest sentence.
 33.In particular, he argued that as s 3(1)(a) was intended to punish bookmakers or their accomplices, the limb (b) definition of `common betting-house` should be read subject to an implied restriction, such that a place was only a `common betting-house` for the purposes of s 3(1)(a) if it was used by a bookmaker. In other words, limb (b) should have read as follows: 
Common betting-house means - 
 
(b) any place kept or used 
 by a bookmaker 
 for habitual betting or wagering on any such event or contingency [Italics my words.]
 34.It followed from this that as the appellant occupied the place for betting 
 as a punter 
, he was not guilty of the s 3(1)(a) offence, but only of the lesser offence under s 5(1).
 35.Against this argument stood my decision in 
Goh Gek Seng v PP
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 316
 , in which I held that for the purposes of s 5(1) it did not matter whether the bet was placed by a punter with a bookmaker, or taken by the bookmaker from a punter - `In either case, they betted with each other` (at p 319). So, in that case, it did not matter whether the appellant betted as a bookmaker or as punter - the evidence on this fact was not clear. Either way, however, it was certain that he was loitering for the purpose of betting in a place to which the public had access - and that sufficed for a conviction.
 36.Applying a `literal approach` to the present case, one would be guilty of the s 3(1)(a) offence regardless of whether one used one`s premises for betting as a punter or as a bookmaker. The capacity in which one `betted` was irrelevant - so long as one was the occupier of the premises, and betting took place therein, the offence was made out.
 37.Advancing his argument that the literal approach ought not to be applied, and 
 Goh Geck Seng 
 distinguished or reversed, counsel raised two innovative points. He first suggested that a literal interpretation of the word `betting` renders the Act duplicitous: the same facts (betting in a common betting-house) attracts criminal liability under s 3(1)(a) and also s 5(1). To avoid this duplicity, he said, s 3(1)(a) had to be read to apply to betting 
 by a bookmaker 
in a common-betting house; and s 5(1) to betting 
 by a punter 
 in a common betting-house. He said that the corresponding harshness in penalties revealed that this was the position intended by Parliament.
 38.However, it is clear that a person is only punishable under s 3(1)(a) if he is also the occupier of the place. As such there is no true duplicity, only that an enhanced penalty is in place for those who are willing to use their premises for the carrying-on of illegal activities. If one is merely present at the premises without being the occupier of them, one is punishable with the lighter sentence under s 5(1). I therefore considered this argument a red herring.
 39.The other point raised by counsel was that the strict translation gives rise to an anomaly: where a punter goes to the betting house (of which he is not the occupier) to place a bet, he is punishable with the lighter sentence under s 5(1), but if he makes the bet by a telephone call from his own home (of which he is the occupier), he is punishable under s 3(1)(a) with the heavier sentence. This was a valid objection which I now propose to address.
 40.One way around the difficulty was to accept the dichotomy proposed by counsel (in other words, s 3(1)(a) only makes it an offence for a person to use the premises he occupies as a bookmaker, and it is not an offence if he uses the premises as a punter). However, as counsel for the appellant conceded, there is no clear distinction of that kind in the Statute. The Act does not distinguish between betting as `a punter` and as `a bookmaker` as far as the definition of a `common betting-house` is concerned. So long as the activity of betting occurs in given premises, that place is a `common betting-house` for the purposes of s 3(1), and the occupier of it guilty of the offence. Prima facie, occupying a `common betting house` attracts criminal liability whether one `bets` as a `punter` or as a `bookmaker`.
 41.Counsel argued strenuously that a purposive interpretation ought to be adopted, and that the Act ought to be construed in the manner Parliament intended - that only s 5(1) should be used to punish punters, whilst the other sections must only apply to bookmakers.
 42.The difficulty with accepting the existence of such an implied restriction on the words `betting` and `wagering` in the s 2(1) definition of `common betting-house` is that this would effectively render definitions (a) and (b) of `common betting-house` nugatory - they would, in that case, almost certainly be covered by limb (c). Such a result could not have been intended by Parliament. If that result was intended, it would have been achieved much more easily by defining `common betting-house` as `premises used by a bookmaker for betting or wagering`.
 43.I think, however, that the result argued for by counsel is sustainable by a different route. What might be reasonably advanced is that where a punter uses his own house to make a phone call, the `bet` is not `placed` in his house, but `placed` at the bookmakers` premises, ie at the premises where the party `taking` the bet is located.
 44.Such an approach would not require us to foist the dichotomy suggested by counsel onto the Act, but would achieve the same result, namely that it is not an offence under s 3(1)(a) to make a bet from one`s own home. This has nothing to do with the capacity in which one makes the bet, but everything to do with where the bet is `placed` - the bet is not `placed` at one`s home but `placed` at the bookmaker`s premises. As the punter is still `betting` with a `bookmaker in any place or by any means` he is still guilty of the s 5(1) offence - but he is not guilty of the s 3(1)(a) offence (as he is not the occupier of a common betting-house).
 45.Let us assume for a moment that the person `receiving` the bets at the other place is not the actual bookmaker but only a servant or agent. If I were to accept the dichotomy proposed by counsel, that the premises must be used by a bookmaker, then the occupier of those premises is not guilty of the s 3(1)(a) offence as the premises are not used by a bookmaker but only his servant or agent. However, the approach I have proposed has this advantage - that such an occupier is still caught by the Act because the premises, being the place where the bets are `placed`, still qualify as a `common betting-house` under limbs (a) and (b) - the former provided the public has access to it. I think this achieves more consistency with the objectives contemplated by the legislature.
 46.Putting it another way, where the betting takes place in a common betting-house, the `bookmaker` would still be liable if he is the occupier - not because he is the bookmaker - but because the bets are placed in premises he occupies. The `punter` who, from his home, places the bet by telephone, would not be liable - not because he is the `punter` - but because the bets are not placed in 
 his 
premises but in the 
 bookmaker`s 
 premises.
 47.An oblique analogy may be offered as follows. A in Malaysia calls B in Singapore and offers to buy B`s bicycle. B agrees. A and B have both `contracted`, but the contract is made in the place where the offer is accepted by the vendor, ie B. So also it is for a gaming contract which would, but for statute, be legal. If A, in his house, calls B, in his office, asking B to take a bet, and B agrees, A and B have `betted` but the `bet` [contract] is made in B`s house, not A`s.
 48.If this is correct, I see no necessity to reconsider my judgment in 
 Goh Geck Seng 
 - the act of `betting` is still committed by both parties (without distinction as to whether one is a `punter` or `bookmaker`). So under s 5(1) loitering for the purpose of betting would still be an offence whether one loitered as a punter or as a bookmaker. Similarly, whether one is using premises as a `punter` or a `bookmaker` would similarly be irrelevant for the purposes of limbs (a) and (b) of the s2(1) definition of a `common betting-house`. Liability under a s 3(1)(a) offence hinges not on the capacity of the offender, but on the user of the premises. I recognise, however, that my views on this point are obiter, and I think the point ultimately lies reserved for future argument.
 49.Finally, I think it necessary to touch briefly on two points. The first, a preliminary objection made by counsel for the appellant in the court below that a failure of justice was occasioned by virtue of the fact that the charge did not specify which definition of common betting-house the prosecution intended to prove. The prosecution indicated that it would attempt to prove all three definitions. I did not think that there was any irregularity in this; nor did it impose a paramount difficulty on the defence. It was an admitted fact from the outset that the premises were used for betting and wagering. All the defence had to show under the respective definitions was that there was no public access to the place, the betting was not habitual, and the premises were not used by a bookmaker. The weight of that burden was not so onerous as to deprive him, tactically, of a fair trial.
 50.The second point was the suggestion by counsel that, supposing I agreed that s 3(1)(a) did punish the occupier of premises regardless of whether they were used by a bookmaker or punter, the use of the premises by a punter was of such a de minimis quality compared to that of the bookmaker that a very lenient sentence ought to be imposed. Reference was made to s 95 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) which provides that it is not an offence if an act causes harm so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of it, and also to my decision in 
Teo Geok Fong v Lim Eng Hock
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 431
  on the same matter. I rejected this argument because it is implicit in the wording of s 95 that the `harm` referred to in the de minimis principle must mean physical, mental, psychological or economic harm suffered by an individual. `Harm` caused by an offence against society, such as gambling or drug-related offences, or minor breaches of road traffic regulations is not susceptible to measurement. The actual `harm` done by a speeding offence or by possession of a minuscule amount of a prohibited drug may be insignificant, but that fact would not qualify either offender as exempt from punishment under the de minimis principle. In such instances, meaning can only be given to the law if it blankets the entire range of offenders, for the cumulative effect of many slight offences causes great harm to society as a whole. Naturally, however, the culpability of any particular offender will be reflected in the sentence he receives - but he is guilty of an offence nonetheless.
 51.
 Conclusion
In short, I found that there was no basis on which to reverse the learned magistrate`s conclusions. Following from this, there was no basis on which counsel could resist the charge - the status of the premises as a `common betting-house` was irrefutably established under limb (c). The conviction was therefore right in law. The sentence, in view of all the circumstances of the case, was not manifestly excessive - a position which I thought counsel for the appellant was prepared to concede as he only argued in his submissions for a lower sentence in the event I agreed with his client`s version of the facts. The appeal was therefore dismissed.",1998-04-20 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant pleaded guilty in the subordinate courts to a charge under s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) (IA); he was convicted and sentenced to seven months` imprisonment. He appealed against sentence and also petitioned for criminal revision. I dismissed the appeal and petition and now give my reasons.
 2.
 Facts
The appellant faced the following two charges: 
You,
 
Name: Assathamby s/o Karupiah, male/30 yrs
 
DOB: 1 October 1966
 
NRIC No: S1781660-H
 
Nationality: Singaporean
 
are charged that you, sometime between April 1997 to 9 June 1997, at `Tomorrow`s Pub & Restaurant Pte Ltd`, 66 Boat Quay, Singapore, did employ one Peramaiyan, an Indian national, as a dishwasher, being a person who has acted in contravention of s 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1985 Ed), by entering Singapore without being in possession of a visit pass, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133), punishable under s 57(1)(ii) of the said Act.
 
You are charged that you, sometime in end of July 1997 and 11 August 1997, at `The Moomba`, 52 Circular Road, Singapore, did employ one Sobuj Nasiruddin, male 24 yrs, a Bangladesh national as a cleaner, being a person who had overstayed on his visit pass in contravention of s 15(1) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133), and you have thereby committed an offence under s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133), and punishable under s 57(1)(ii) of the said Act.
 3.His case was heard on 24 September 1997. Oral representations by his counsel to the prosecution had failed; the prosecution proceeded with the first charge while the second was stood down. The appellant pleaded guilty to the first charge. He admitted without qualification a statement of facts which stated, inter alia: 
2 The accused operates a cleaning company styled Like Brothers Cleaning Service. 
3 On 9 June 97 at about 8.30pm, the complainant [a police officer] together with a party of police officers conducted a check at the premises of Tomorrow`s Pub & Restaurant in No 66 Boat Quay. Thereat, a male Indian national Peramaiyan was arrested for contravening the Immigration Act. It was established that he was an illegal immigrant who entered Singapore on 25 March 1997. 
4 Investigations revealed that the said Peramaiyan was employed by the accused to work as a dishwasher and deployed for worker at Tomorrow`s Pub & Restaurant between the month of 1 April 1997 till the day of his arrest; ie on 9 June 1997. Peramaiyan was promised a monthly income of $800. 
5 The accused by employing the said Peramaiyan, has thereby committed an offence under s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) punishable under s 57(1)(ii) of the said Act.
 4.The appellant was duly convicted on this charge. Submissions on mitigation were heard and sentencing done on 30 September 1997, after the appellant had had time to sort out personal matters and further instruct his counsel. The appellant consented to having the second charge taken into consideration for sentencing. In mitigation, his counsel said that he was his family`s sole financial supporter. He had started his cleaning business in 1994 but experienced difficulty in finding workers; his family members had to help and even the appellant himself sometimes stood in as a cleaner. The notes of the hearing record his counsel as saying: 
 
Accused does not mean to flaunt the law. Was forced into situation wherby [sic] he was bound by contractual obligations to fulfil his part of the bargain.
 
Not disputing offences were committed.
 
Had to resort to rely on foreign workers. Difficult for him to employ local ones. Tried his utmost best to get the workers. Even did much of the work himself.
 
 
Employed worker for about two months. At this time, he also helped out in the cleaning in the places.
 
Realises the foolishness of his action now. In fact, action resulting in hardship not only for himself but also to family members who rely upon him.
 
Has been very much worried about the case. Shown remorse. Wishes to assure court that will never repeat the offence.
 
 5.The district judge sentenced him to seven months` imprisonment. In his grounds of decision, the judge noted that the mandatory minimum punishment was six months` imprisonment while the maximum was two years. He took into account the mitigating factors, including the appellant`s plea of guilt and his remorse. The judge did not attach weight to a previous conviction for robbery as this happened over 16 years ago when the appellant was young and he had been placed on probation.
 6.The appellant changed lawyers and appealed against his sentence. An application for criminal revision was later made as well.
 7.
 Criminal revision
Before me, counsel for the appellant contended that the proceedings below were flawed because the appellant had pleaded guilty while under the mistaken notion that the charge and statement of facts revealed an offence under s 57(1)(e) of the IA. The charge and statement of facts merely stated that Peramaiyan was employed by the appellant, and failed to state that the appellant knew Peramaiyan was an illegal immigrant. It was argued that the appellant had in fact employed Peramaiyan while thinking he was a Singapore citizen because Peramaiyan had showed him a Singapore identity card.
 8.The relevant parts of s 57(1) are as follows: 
Any person who - 
 
(e) employs any person who has acted in contravention of section 6(1), 15 or 36 of the regulations; 
 
 
shall be guilty of an offence and - 
 
(ii) in the case of an offence under paragraph (b), (d) or (e), shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 6 months and not more than 2 years and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $6,000; 
 
 9.Counsel for the appellant was correct in saying that neither the charge nor the statement of facts alleged that the appellant knew of Peramaiyan`s status as an illegal immigrant. Such knowledge is needed for a conviction under s 57(1)(e) and the offence is not one of strict liability: 
Naranjan Singh s/o Ujagar Singh v PP
 
[1993] 1 CLAS News 237
. Section 57(1)(e) does not refer to knowledge and it seems that charges under s 57(1)(e) have customarily been drafted according to the terms of the section without mention of the accused`s knowledge. But in my view, including an allegation of knowledge in the charge would be the better practice, and the present charge should prima facie be considered defective. A charge should state all essential ingredients of an offence, to give an accused notice of the offence and a chance to defend himself. The mens rea requirement for the s 57(1)(e) offence is expressly stated only in caselaw, but it is an important element in the offence and should not be omitted from a charge.
 10.I am aware that the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) requirements on charges may appear less stringent. Section 158 of the CPC states, inter alia: 
(1) Every charge under this Code shall state the offence with which the appellant is charged. 
 
(3) If the law which creates the offence does not give it any specific name, so much of the definition of the offence must be stated so as to give the appellant notice of the matter with which he is charged. 
(4) The law and section of the law against which the offence is said to have been committed shall be mentioned in the charge. 
(5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every legal condition required by law to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case. 
 
 
 Illustrations
 
(a) A is charged with the murder of B. This is equivalent to a statement that A`s act fell within the definition of murder given in sections 299 and 300 of the Penal Code; that he did not come within any of the general exceptions of the Code; and that it did not fall within any of the 5 exceptions to section 300 or that, if it did fall within exception 1, one or other of the 3 provisos to that exception applied to it. 
(b) A is charged under section 326 of the Penal Code with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to B by means of an instrument for shooting. This is equivalent to a statement that the case was not provided for by section 335 of the Penal Code and that the general exceptions did not apply to it. 
 
 11.It may be argued that a charge need only identify the relevant offence; s 57(1)(e) provides for only one possible offence and no confusion can result from the failure to mention the mens rea element, which must be taken to have been incorporated in the charge by virtue of s 158(5). But I see no reason to read s 158(5) this way. The illustrations reproduced above do not support it and charges in practice are invariably drafted by reference to the ingredients of the offence as set out in the offence-creating section. As already stated, even if the mens rea for s 57(1)(e) is not expressly set out in the section, it is no less an ingredient of the offence. Stating the mens rea element in the charge is not burdensome for the prosecution and may be important to an unrepresented or poorly advised accused. There is a legal burden on a court to record a statement of facts and to scrutinise it to ensure that all the elements of the charge are made out therein: 
Mok Swee Kok v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
 . The objective of this exercise is to ascertain that the accused in fact committed the offence alleged, and it will not be achieved if the charge does not list all ingredients of the offence.
 12.In addition, counsel for the appellant argued that the need to specify knowledge in the charge was not obviated by the presumption of knowledge in s 57(8) of the IA. I agreed with this submission. In 
Shekhar a/l Subramaniam v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 744
 , I held that an analogous presumption in s 57(6) of the IA need not be expressly included in a charge under s 57(1)(c) (conveying to Singapore a prohibited immigrant) because s 57(6) was merely an evidential provision. But there, the accused`s guilty knowledge had been specified in the charge [aelig ] probably because it is expressly mentioned in s 57(1)(c). In any case, the s 57(8) presumption did not apply in this case, because the appellant was not an `occupier` of the premises where Peramaiyan was working. The appellant was a cleaning contractor supplying workers to restaurants and did not satisfy the definition of `occupier` in s 2 of the IA. In 
Lee Boon Leong Joseph v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 445
 , I said that a person must have substantial control of premises before he can be considered an `occupier`, and held that the accused there [aelig ] a cleaning contractor who supplied cleaners to a supermarket [aelig ] had lacked such control. There was no allegation that the appellant had control over the restaurant where Peramaiyan worked.
 13.Accordingly, I regarded the charge as defective. However, s 162 of the CPC states that no error or omission in a charge shall be regarded as material unless the accused was in fact misled. In addition, s 396 provides that an irregularity in the proceedings is immaterial unless it occasioned a failure of justice. The High Court may, in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction, amend a charge and convict upon it: 
PP v Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 573
 . Whether the defect in the charge was material depended on the circumstances in which the appellant pleaded guilty.
 14.Counsel argued that the appellant had failed to raise a possible defence below because he was unaware that it would exonerate him from the charge. The appellant claimed to have employed Peramaiyan while thinking that he was a Singapore citizen because he was shown a false Singaporean identity card. In my view, if this was true, the appellant would have had a good defence to the charge; there would have been no reason for him to suspect that Peramaiyan was an immigrant, much less an illegal one, and the mens rea for the offence in s 57(1)(e) would not have been satisfied.
 15.However, the appellant produced no evidence of his belief that Peramaiyan was Singaporean, apart from an alleged copy of Peramaiyan`s identity card. Counsel merely asserted that the appellant had been so mistaken. The copy of the identity card did not in fact bear Peramaiyan`s name; it bore the name of one Murugaiyan Subramaniam.
 16.The appellant`s alleged mistake had in fact been considered by his former counsel before the appellant pleaded guilty below. This was shown by a letter from his former counsel to his later counsel, written after his conviction. The letter stated: 
Please note that on our initial instructions from our client, Mr Assathamby s/o Karupiah, the accused, he had revealed the following: 
(a) that he was led to believe that the foreign national was a Singaporean; 
(b) that he had taken measures via interviews to check that the foreign national was Singaporean; 
(c) that he was misled.
 
Please find attached the photocopy of the `Singapore NRIC` of the foreign national.
 
The accused had decided to take a certain course of action after oral representations made to the senior DPP were unsuccessful in that the charges were not reduced.
 17.Given that his counsel had been so instructed, I found it difficult to believe that the appellant did not know his mistake about Peramaiyan`s citizenship would afford a valid defence. If it was not regarded as a defence, on what basis were representations made to the prosecution? And why were the circumstances of his defence not mentioned in the mitigation plea? Moreover, it was hard to believe that his counsel was unaware of the need for mens rea under s 57(1)(e); ss 57(8) to (10) make no sense otherwise and there are several recent reported decisions on these provisions.
 18.In addition, the appellant`s defence was inconsistent with the mitigation plea made before the district judge. From the mitigation plea it emerged that the appellant knew he was hiring foreign workers but had been forced to do so by his contractual obligations; he knew what he was doing was wrong and now regretted his actions.
 19.The prosecution, on its part, produced an affidavit from the investigation officer in charge of the case. According to the affidavit, investigations revealed that when Peramaiyan first spoke to the appellant on 20 April 1997, he told the appellant that he was new in Singapore and wanted a job. The appellant said he would employ him if he had a Singapore identity card. Peramaiyan said he had to borrow money from friends to buy an identity card and this would take two days, whereupon the appellant arranged to meet him on 23 April 1997. Peramaiyan accordingly purchased an identity card belonging to one Murugaiyan Subramaniam and met the appellant as agreed; the appellant did not ask him anything about his identity other than looking at this identity card.
 20.In the circumstances, I believed that the appellant in fact knew that Peramaiyan was an illegal immigrant. He was aware that mens rea was required under s 57(1)(e) but chose not to pursue his alleged defence because he was not confident of proving it; he elected to plead guilty instead in the hope of a lighter sentence. He was therefore not misled by the defect in the charge and the defect was immaterial by virtue of s 162 of the CPC. Similarly, his plea of guilt was in substance unqualified despite the deficiencies in the charge and the statement of facts.
 21.Accordingly I dismissed the petition for criminal revision. I amended the charge to include the appellant`s knowledge of Peramaiyan`s status as an immigration offender, by substituting the words `whom you knew or had reasonable grounds for believing to be` in place of the word `being` in the charge, and convicted the appellant on the amended charge.
 22.
 Appeal against sentence
For his appeal against sentence the appellant relied on the same ground, ie that he was in fact unaware that Peramaiyan was an immigration offender. I rejected this contention for the reasons above. The appellant`s sentence was not manifestly excessive. He had agreed to have a second charge taken into consideration for sentencing, and his sentence of seven months` jail was only one month longer than the mandatory minimum. I therefore dismissed the appeal.",1998-04-13 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
LIM TEONG QWEE JC
 The plaintiffs in both actions claim as owners or as persons entitled to the immediate possession or as consignees of the cargo shipped on board the vessel `Jambo` at ports in Thailand for carriage to and discharge at ports in China. The first defendant in Suit No 2077/94 (Brendon Shipping) was the owner of the vessel at the time of shipment and the second defendant (Paciro Shipping) was its agent. The third defendant (Wee) was the managing director of Brendon Shipping and held 50% of its issued capital. He was also the managing director of Paciro Shipping and held 90% of its issued capital. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants wrongfully sold the cargo to the defendants in Suit No 420/95 or one or more of them. They claim damages for conversion of the cargo against the defendants in both actions.
 2.The two actions were consolidated but shortly after the first defendant in Suit No 420/95 had given evidence that action was settled. In Suit No 2077/94 there was an alternative claim against Brendon Shipping for damages for breach of duty as bailee for reward and breach of contract of carriage but that claim was not proceeded with as the action only proceeded as against Paciro Shipping and Wee. At the conclusion of the trial I gave judgment for the plaintiffs against Paciro Shipping and Wee. These are my grounds.
 3.It was not disputed that the cargo was shipped on board the Jambo as alleged and that the plaintiffs were the holders of the bills of lading in respect of the cargo. In fact other goods were also shipped on board the vessel for the same voyage and the plaintiffs were not entitled to the entire cargo but for convenience I shall refer to the plaintiffs` goods as their cargo as they have been so referred to by the parties in these proceedings. The Jambo sailed from the Thai port of Songkhla on 15 June 1993 but returned to port shortly after and did not complete the contemplated voyage. It was admitted by Wee that the cargo was sold to the second defendant in Suit No 420/95 under two contracts both dated 13 December 1993. The seller in each contract was Brendon Shipping. Each was signed for the seller by Wee over the name `AJ Brendon Shipping Pte Ltd`. The defendants` case in Suit No 2077/94 is that the plaintiffs had abandoned their cargo and the defendants were entitled to sell it. The alternative case is that the defendants were agents of necessity of the plaintiffs for the purpose of disposing of their cargo.
 4.
 Abandonment
Mr Leong`s submission is that the plaintiffs knew of the casualty and that they knew of the claims of MN Offshore Services (salvors) and of Chaophaya Terminal International Co Ltd (CTIC) the port operator at Songkhla. Brendon Shipping signed an agreement with the salvors on 18 June 1993 for the salvage of the Jambo and its cargo `that on the 15 June 1993 called for assistance, after starting to list 10 degrees to the starboard side` according to what is stated in the agreement. Paciro Shipping signed an agreement with CTIC on 29 June 1993 for port and warehousing services at Songkhla after the Jambo had returned to port. It is said that the plaintiffs also knew of the deterioration of the cargo and the freight costs to reship to Chinese ports. The plaintiffs were themselves `sourcing the market for buyers`. The inference so the argument goes is that the plaintiffs had made a commercial decision that it was not economically viable to reship the cargo to the original destination. It was also submitted that the plaintiffs` delay or failure in providing general average security was a further indication of their intention to abandon the cargo.
 5.I will consider the question of the furnishing of security first. Paciro Shipping as agent of the ship owner Brendon Shipping appointed Richards Hogg International (RHI) as general average adjusters. On 2 July 1993 RHI wrote to cargo interests (including the plaintiffs). Part of the letter said: 
The vessel loaded approximately 3,444 tons of rubber and 3,100 tons of polyester chips at Laemchbang and Songkhla, Thailand. At approximately 0730 hours on 15.6.93, the vessel departed Songkhla for her two ports of destination, Xingang and Dalien. It is noted from the master`s report that at approximately 0800 hours, the vessel touched ground and soon thereafter commenced listing towards her starboard side. The list became severe (approximately 35 to 40) and it was apparent that water had entered the vessel, at hold no 1.
 
A salvage contract was signed by the ship managers with a salvor in Thailand on a lump sum basis. At the time of sending this message, salvage operations continue to be performed and it is the ship managers` intention to discharge cargo at Songkhla, repair the vessel, reload the cargo, and continue with the original voyage.
 
As a result of the above, the ship managers have declared general average. It is therefore necessary for the consignees and their insurers to provide satisfactory general average security to us prior to delivery of the cargo at destination.
 `Ship managers` was a reference to Paciro Shipping. Blank forms of average guarantee and Lloyd`s average bond were enclosed. Both were expressed to be given in consideration of delivery of the goods. Mr Chia Jiew Chein Gerry was the adjusting manager of RHI in 1993. He said that RHI did not prepare any general average adjustment for the casualty. He was referred to a letter dated 12 October 1993 written by him in which RHI said: 
Kindly take note that we have ceased all work as shipowners have not paid our interim account for extensive work that has been carried out by us.
 It was not disputed that by that date RHI had ceased all work for the shipowner and no other average adjuster had been appointed in their place.
 6.The plaintiffs` cargo was not lost in the casualty or sacrificed whether or not for the purpose of preserving the ship or any other cargo that might have been imperilled. The defendants allege that Brendon Shipping incurred expenditure of a general average nature but no demand had at any time at all been made for payment of the correct amount payable by any of the plaintiffs. General average was never adjusted at all. In these circumstances all that Brendon Shipping had was a possessory lien on the plaintiffs` cargo for the amount if any that was properly payable. This position was well appreciated by RHI who called for satisfactory general average security to be provided 
 prior to delivery of the cargo at destination 
. There was no evidence of any change in the position. There was no obligation on the part of the plaintiffs to provide any security before Brendon Shipping was ready to deliver the cargo. There was no failure or delay on the part of the plaintiffs to provide general average security. In fact all the plaintiffs other than the sixth plaintiff did provide security by way of the average guarantee.
 7.I turn now to Mr Leong`s main submission. The plaintiffs were informed of the casualty and through their insurers they retained Clyde & Co a firm of solicitors in England with a South East Asia office in Singapore (Clyde (Singapore)). Clyde (Singapore) instructed CCIC (Thailand) Co Ltd (CCIC) of Bangkok to make certain inquiries. On 8 October 1993 Clyde (Singapore) wrote to CCIC: 
1 Please let us know the current whereabouts of the cargo and its condition. 
2 We understand from our telephone conversation that the port authority and the salvage company are claiming a fee from cargo interests. Please confirm the position and indicate the level of the fee that has been requested. 
3 Please confirm whether the port authority/salvors have refused to release the cargo until such a fee is paid. 
4 Please let us know the current status of the vessel and whether she is under arrest by the port authority or, alternatively, when she is due to sail. 
5 We should be grateful if you would let us know whether the identity of any lawyers acting for either the port authority, the salvors, or the shipowners.
 8.On 9 October 1993 CCIC passed on to Clyde (Singapore) this information received from the port director of CTIC: 
A agreement was made between ship`s owner and the port concerning to port services required, port charge rates, and payment. Ship`s owner agreed that all the port charges payment would be fully paid before vessel sailing. The up-to-date outstanding debts which ship`s owner owed to the Port is amounting to 12 million bahts. According to our stands, the vessel and cargoes will not be released until the payment being fully paid to our Port.
 
It was said that ship`s owner also owed a amount of more than 30 millions to [the salvors] for their salvage costs.
 9.In the course of the next few days there was an exchange of letters between them. On 12 October 1993 Clyde (Singapore) wrote: 
We attach for your information copies of the Salvage Agreement and Certificate of Termination of Salvage, supplied by the salvors` solicitors. As far as we are aware, cargo interests were not consulted in respect of the salvage agreement and we wish to reserve our clients` right to argue that they are not bound by that agreement.
 
However, we consider the immediate problem is to establish the level of payments that would be required by the Port Authority and the salvors from the cargo interests in order to release the cargo. Our clients will need to know this and also the value of the cargo in its present condition so that they may consider whether it will be economically viable to attempt to re-ship the cargo to destination.
 
In the circumstances, we should be grateful if you would make immediate arrangements to travel to Songkhla and make the following enquiries: 
1 The level of payment that will be demanded by the port authority from cargo interests in respect of this casualty and whether the port authority would accept a part payment from cargo, even if the shipowners have not agreed to pay the balance of the port dues. In other words, will the port authority consider a separate deal with cargo interests that does not involve the shipowners? 
2 The level of the demand of salvors in respect of cargo and whether salvors would consider a separate deal which does not involve shipowners. We understand that salvors may not be entitled to exercise a lien over the cargo. We are investigating this but you should bear this in mind in any discussions you may have. 
3 The value of the cargo in its present condition. 
4 The residual value of the ship in her present condition. 
5 The likely costs and logistical steps necessary to re-sort and re-load the cargo onto a transhipment vessel, including freight charges.
 10.On 13 October 1993 CCIC wrote: 
We estimate that the value of the cargo in its present condition is as follows:
 
Cargo Remains
Amount Insured
Devaluation Rate
Rubber
USD1,464,828.00
40%-60%
USD 732,414.00
Polyester Chips
USD1,931,325.00

The residual value of the ship in her present condition is about USD800,000 to USD1,000,000, according to the Songkhla Port Authority`s estimating.
 
The cost of re-load the cargo onto a transhipment vessel:
 
If rubber, port`s fee: USD1.00/MT, vessel`s freight: USD34/MT prepaid.
 
If polyester chips: vessel`s freight: USD36/MT.
 11.On 14 October 1993 Clyde (Singapore) wrote: 
One point we would ask you to bear in mind is that we do not necessarily accept that cargo interests owe any moneys to either the salvors or the port authority. At this stage, we are anxious to learn what sums the port and the salvage company would accept to release the cargo, but these enquiries must be without prejudice to cargo interests` legal rights.
 12.On 14 October 1993 CCIC passed on to Clyde (Singapore) part of a letter of the same date from CTIC to Paciro Shipping: 
we request that you provide us a cash payment with an amount of THB18,800,000 before the cargo reloading to any other replaced vessel.
 
The total amount of port service charges up to 20 October 1993 including the cargo reloading on to the replace vessel is estimated to be THB18,800,000.
 
You are requested to confirm by return fax or telex before 12:00 on 15 October 1993. Should you fail to do that, we shall have to take necessary actions.
 13.The same day Clyde (Singapore) wrote: 
Please explain who [Paciro Shipping] are, and who they represent in this matter. Furthermore, we should be grateful if you could clarify whether the figure of THB18,000,800 includes the charges incurred by the ship whilst alongside the wharf, or whether they relate only to cargo handling/storage charges.
 They followed up the next day with another letter: 
We note from your fax of yesterday that the Port Authority have set a deadline for [Paciro Shipping] to respond by 1200 hours today.
 
In the circumstances, please make urgent telephone enquiries of the Port Director to find out what they intend doing with the cargo. We suspect that the `necessary actions` referred to by the Port Authority may include sale of the cargo. If this is the case, please explain to the Port Director that we have only just been instructed in this matter and request that he takes no immediate steps in respect of the cargo.
 14.On 15 October 1993 CCIC passed on part of a letter from CTIC to CCIC: 
In response to your fax of 14 October 1993, the following is for your information:
 
Mr Jacky Wee, Managing Director of [Paciro Shipping] is the actual owner of MV Jambo. All the salvage services we provided were applied by him or his representative.
 
THB18,800,000 is including cargo reloading from the port onto the replaced vessel and the cargo storage fee is calculated as up to 20 October 1993. The port charges incurred mostly is cargo storage charge, partly incurred by labour services charge and services related to vessel operations.
 
Please note the cargo storage now is costed about THB190,000 per day.
 Later the same day CCIC passed on part of a letter received from the salvors: 
We would be delighted to consider a separate deal with the cargo interests which does not involve the shipowner, but will at first consult our lawyers.
 
We are prepared to release the cargo on an immediate payment to our bank account the sum of S$3.5m which could be the basis of a security/salvage arbitration possibly involving Clyde & Co in London.
 15.On 15 October 1993 Clyde (Singapore) wrote to CCIC: 
We note the position that has been adopted by [the salvors]. In view of the unreasonableness of the position they are adopting, we see no benefit in your communicating with them any further for the time being.
 16.At about this point in time the position as seen by the plaintiffs might have been something like this. Their cargo was worth about US$1.6m. CTIC`s claim down to 20 October 1993 was 18,800,000 baht or about US$740,000. The salvors` claim was $2.5m or about US$1.8m although they asked for $3.5m or about US$2.5m. The aggregate of the claims exceeded the value of the plaintiffs` cargo by about US$1m or more. It was submitted that it was not economically viable to reship the cargo for carriage to the original destination. That may well be so but it is quite another thing to say that the plaintiffs must have decided or intended to abandon their cargo. The cargo had some value. It had deteriorated but there was no evidence that it had become unsaleable at any time. If the plaintiffs were liable to contribute in general average the liability would not be discharged or in any way affected by their abandoning their cargo. Their loss could only be increased by its value if they elected to abandon it. The cargo was in the possession of CTIC. The salvors had given up possession but they would have a maritime lien for salvage services. CTIC had given notice of `necessary actions` and it was not unlikely that such actions would include sale. Again the plaintiffs` loss could not be diminished by any renunciation of the value of the cargo. Whether or not they were liable to contribute in general average or for port or warehousing services in no way at all could abandonment of the cargo improve their position. Above all it was Brendon Shipping that was primarily liable and its vessel estimated by CTIC to be worth US$800,000 to US$1m was also at risk and it was Paciro Shipping`s intention expressed through RHI in their letter of 2 July 1993 to continue the original voyage. In these cricumstances it cannot be inferred that the plaintiffs had intended to abandon their cargo and in my judgment the defence of abandonment has not been made good.
 17.
 Agency of necessity
Contrary to the expressed intention of Paciro Shipping the Jambo was not repaired, the cargo was not reloaded and the original voyage was not continued. The cargo ex Jambo was loaded onto the `Ryong Nam San` but the plaintiffs were not informed by Paciro Shipping or Wee of the shipment of their cargo. On 14 January 1994 Clyde (Singapore) wrote to Paciro Shipping for the attention of Wee: 
We understand that the cargo ex-`Jambo` has been loaded on to a vessel called the `Ryong Namsan`, which vessel we understand is bound for Xingang. We would be grateful if you could provide us with the position of the `Ryong Namsan` and her estimated time of arrival at Xingang.
 
We would also be grateful if you could provide us with copies of the bills of lading that were issued by the `Ryong Namsan` for this cargo.
 Wee said he did not recall having received this at about that time and only first saw it in preparing for trial.
 18.On 27 January 1994 Clyde (Singapore) again wrote to Paciro Shipping for the attention of Wee: 
I refer to our meeting yesterday where you confirmed to me that this cargo has been sold to Cosco, Jakarta. You also mentioned that you are in the process of preparing detailed accounts regarding the sale of this cargo and I would be grateful if you could let me have a copy of these accounts as soon as they become available.
 Again Wee said he did not recall having received this at about that time. He also denied having met with Mr Rawlings of Clyde (Singapore) who wrote the letter. The cargo had in fact been sold by this time.
 19.Mr Leong referred to 
Munro v Willmott
 
[1948] 2 All ER 983
 where Lynskey J said at pp 985-986: 
I am very doubtful if the doctrine of agent of necessity can be applied to a case of goods stored in premises, but, if it can, it can only be applied in a case of real emergency which necessitates the disposal of the goods.
 In 
 Munro 
 the plaintiff`s motor car had been parked at the defendant`s premises along with a caravan (in which she lived with her mother and stepfather) and two lorries used in her stepfather`s business and when the family moved to another location in the course of the business they took everything with them except the motor car which was not in working condition and was unlicensed. The defendant allowed it to be left there without charge. That was in about September 1942. In December 1945 he sold the car as it was causing difficulty to other vehicles. He did not know the plaintiff`s address and he had tried unsuccessfully to contact her stepfather. The learned judge referred to 
Sachs v Miklos & Ors
 
[1948] 1 All ER 67
 where Lord Goddard CJ said at p 68: 
Agents of necessity, until very modern times, were confined to two classes of persons, those who accepted bills of exchange for the honour of the payee and masters of ships who found themselves in foreign parts and unable to get immediate instructions from their owners when they wanted money for unlooked-for expenses and so forth. They then had power to pledge, sell, or hypothecate the ship, and, in some cases, to deal with the cargo as agents of necessity.
 He was not satisfied that there was any emergency and concluded that the defendant was not justified in selling the car as an agent of necessity.
 20.Mr Leong also referred to 
Burns Philp & Co Ltd v Gillespie Bros Pty Ltd
 
[1947] 
74 CLR 148
 and in particular to two passages from the judgment of Latham CJ at p 172 where he said: 
In my opinion what is said in 
Cargo ex `Argos`
 
[1873] LR 5 PC 134
 shows that there is no absolute duty resting upon the master of a vessel in all cases to communicate with the owners of goods before he takes action in the interests of the owners of the goods to save the goods from loss or destruction.
 and at p 177 where he said: 
If propositions nos 1 and 2 are rejected (as in my opinion they should be) then proposition no 3 must be accepted. Upon this view there is a duty arising from necessity and created by law, not by agreement of the parties, to act reasonably and prudently in the interests of the cargo-owner in an emergency which threatens the loss or destruction of the cargo, even though the contract makes no provision dealing with such a case.
 Proposition no 1 is that the master has no right (and a fortiori no duty) to do anything with respect to the cargo unless it is required or at least authorised by some provision in the terms of the contract. Proposition no 2 is that the master is entitled but not bound to take any reasonable and prudent though uncovenanted action in order to preserve the cargo. Mr Leong`s argument as I understand it is that Brendon Shipping as the shipowner had a duty to act reasonably and prudently in the interests of the plaintiffs as owners of the cargo in an emergency and there was no duty in this case to communicate with them before it sold the cargo. I should point out that the judgment of Latham CJ was a dissenting judgment and the question in issue before the court was whether the carrier was entitled to `back freight` ie freight for carrying the shipper`s goods back to the port of loading if the voyage back was undertaken for the security of the ship and cargo considered as one adventure in the sense of the interests afloat considered as one unit and not undertaken for the purpose of preserving the shipper`s goods. Agency of necessity if it was relevant was not really in issue as it was found as a fact that the master (as he was informed) could not communicate with the owners of the goods. See per Starke J at p 184 and see also per Dixon J at p 191.
 21.The Jambo sailed from Songkhla at about 0730 hours on 15 June 1993 and at about 0800 hours `the vessel touched ground and soon thereafter commenced listing` according to the letter of RHI dated 2 July 1993. On 18 June 1993 Brendon Shipping entered into a salvage agreement with the salvors and the vessel was towed to port. The vessel was handed back to Brendon Shipping`s representative on 29 June 1993 at 0800 hours as stated in an agreement between the salvors and Brendon Shipping dated 28 June 1993. For the next five months until the shipment on board the Ryong Nam San the plaintiffs` cargo was at Songkhla in the possession of CTIC under an agreement for port and warehousing services. There was no evidence of any present or imminent danger to the cargo except possibly for the risk of sale or other enforcement procedures by CTIC or the salvors for the indebtedness of Brendon Shipping. In these circumstances I am far from being satisfied that there was any emergency in any sense. There was certainly no emergency that threatened the loss or destruction of the cargo after the Jambo had been towed back to port and the cargo had been discharged. In my opinion 
 Sachs 
, 
 Munro 
 and 
 Burns Philp 
 do not assist the defendants.
 22.On 15 October 1993 Brendon Shipping in a letter signed by Wee advised CTIC that it was intended `to berth the vessel MV Sulteng I alongside [on that day] to load approximately 3000 tonnes of rubber only`. That included the plaintiffs` cargo. Wee`s evidence under cross-examination was: 
Q: Page 394. Agree that on 15 October 1993 you agreed for this cargo to be sold for purchaser to pay port charges and your agents` fees? 
A: Yes. 
Q: You signed as director of AJ Brendon? 
A: Yes. 
Q: 15 October 1993. You decided to sell cargo? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Decision to sell. Yesterday said in December 1993? 
A: In October 1993 salvors secured buyers and asked me to help them. So I had to say yes to sale to help them. December 1993. Decision was taken on my own. Not at salvors` insistence.
 Wee had decided to sell the plaintiffs` cargo as early as mid-October 1993. That sale fell through because CTIC refused to release the cargo. Wee said under cross-examination that he was not aware of this in October 1993 but he was subsequently informed by CTIC. There was no evidence that Brendon Shipping or Paciro Shipping or Wee or any other person attempted to communicate with any of the plaintiffs to seek their instructions or authority to sell the cargo or deal with it in any other way.
 23.Wee knew that he had to come to terms with CTIC if Brendon Shipping or the salvors wished to sell the cargo. On 10 December 1993 he signed an agreement with CTIC as the representative of Brendon Shipping and Paciro Shipping. Essentially the agreement provided for payment of 23 million baht to CTIC for its charges to facilitate the shipment of the cargo by a substitute vessel. The vessel was not named although it was going to be the Ryong Nam San.
 24.Wee admitted under cross-examination that he received a draft of this agreement on 7 December 1993 and that it was Mr George Then (the first defendant in Suit No 420/95) who gave it to him. He said there were no negotiations between CTIC and the two companies he represented. He went to Songkhla to sign the agreement. This was his evidence: 
Q: When at port authority`s office? 
A: Can`t recall but must be on date we signed agreement ie 10 December 1993. 
Q: At port authority`s office. `We were all present`. Who? 
A: Myself, Peter Tauro of salvors, purchaser Mr Nilam and George Then representing purchaser. Also my port agent Mr Lian and Mr Jin representing CTIC. Mr Jin is based in Singapore. Mr Tao Jun also. 
A: I don`t think I had draft agreement with me. I did not see anyone else with draft. Mr Tao Jun and Mr Jin discussed with Mr Nilam. I cannot recall joining in the discussions. They reached an agreement. Agreement was in accordance with agreement signed. Agreement in the form as signed was brought to the meeting. From beginning. If I recall it was brought by Mr Tao Jun. Can`t recall if it was amended but it could have been. I was party but not interested. I was reluctant party. Just to help them out.
 Mr Tao Jun was the port director of CTIC. It was undoubtedly the buyer who was providing the funds to pay CTIC. The salvors were an interested party. When `they reached an agreement` the agreement of 10 December 1993 was signed.
 25.The two agreements for the sale of the plaintiffs` cargo were both dated 13 December 1993. Wee signed for Brendon Shipping in both agreements. Under cross-examination he said: 
Q: Amendment. Clause 3. One of two signatures. Yours? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Next to yours? 
A: Purchaser. Don`t know who signed. Contract was brought to me already signed by purchaser. Words in cl 3. I deleted because I take it they want to sell my vessel. 
 
Q: Clause 3. When agreement brought to you. Signature of purchaser there? 
A: Don`t remember but don`t think it was there. 
Q: Right to say counter-signature of purchaser was after you deleted words in cl 3? 
A: Believe so. 
 
Q: 13 December 1993. You were in Songkhla? 
A: Can`t remember. 
Q: Know if any of purchaser`s representatives were in Songkhla on 13 December 1993? 
A: Don`t know. 
Q: Contracts brought to you. In Singapore or Songkhla? 
A: Can`t recall.
 Clause 3 before the amendment provided `Time of Sale. Upon signing of contract and signing of Bill of Sale.` The last six words were deleted. Wee was not selling `my [his] vessel`.
 26.I should think that the buyer would be reluctant to commit himself to buy the cargo unless terms were agreed with CTIC so that it could be shipped and he would be even more reluctant to commit himself to provide funds to pay CTIC unless the sale was concluded. The likelihood is that the CTIC agreement of 10 December 1993 and the two sale agreements of 13 December 1993 were signed at about the same time but intended to take effect one after the other.
 27.I now come to the `substitute vessel` that was not named in the CTIC agreement of 10 December 1993. On 9 December 1993 ie the day before Wee was in Songkhla to sign the agreement with CTIC he wrote to Songkhla Eastern Maritime Ltd for the attention of Mr Lian (his port agent): 
After successful negotiations with the port of Songkhla regarding the port charges of M/V Jambo, we have reached an agreement where they agreed to release the cargoes back to me.
 
I have already arrange a substitute vessel to load the cargo from M/V Jambo from the port and then she can complete her voyage to China.
 Under cross-examination Wee said: 
Q: 9 December 1993. You intended to complete voyage to China? That Jambo should proceed to China from Songkhla? 
A: Can`t remember. Should be no because vessel was not in a position to sail. 
Q: 9 December 1993. You intended to arrange for substitute vessel to carry goods to China? 
A: No. 
Q: 9 December 1993. Had you already decided cargo would be sold? 
A: Presume so. Contract was not signed yet. Until purchaser could prove they could fulfill obligations to port to pay all charges.
 It was not intended by Wee that the Jambo should complete the voyage and carry the cargo to the original destination.
 28.Later under further cross-examination Wee said: 
Q: 1PB-281. You sent this to your Songkhla agent on 9 December 1993? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Paragraph 2. Untrue? 
A: Untrue. 
Q: Not arranged substitute vessel? 
A: I did not. 
Q: Vessel not proceeding to China? 
A: No.
 Wee agreed that para 2 was untrue. The substitute vessel was not proceeding to China. The plaintiffs` cargo was not going to be carried to the original destination. Wee said he did not arrange for substitute vessel. He himself did not do so. He said: 
Q: 9 December 1993. Substitute vessel already arranged? 
A: Don`t know. 
Q: When you were first informed substitute vessel arranged to load cargo ex Jambo at Songkhla? 
A: 10 December 1993. After signing agreement in port authority`s office in Songkhla. 
Q: Who informed you? 
A: Purchaser. Can`t recall who. I try my best. Should be Mr Nilam. 
Q: You were given name of substitute vessel? 
A: Yes, but I was really not interested. Not interested to know. 
Q: Substitute vessel. Ryong Nam San? 
A: Yes.
 29.The first defendant in Suit No 420/95 (Mr George Then) was referred to a fixture note dated 7 December 1993 between Goodstar Shipping Ltd as disponent owner and Cosco Shipping Inc (the second defendant in Suit No 420/95) as charterer. This was his evidence: 
Q: Ryong Nam San was chartered by Cosco to load cargo ex Songkhla? 
A: Chartered by A J Brendon. 
Q: 1DB-88/89. Fixture note concluded between Cosco and Goodstar for charter of Ryong Nam San? 
A: Can`t remember. 
 
Q: Agree on 7 December 1993you were aware that Cosco chartered Ryong Nam San from Goodstar? 
A: No. 
Q: Aware when agreement was signed between CTIC and A J Brendon and Paciro on 10 December 1993that Ryong Nam San was chartered by Cosco from Goodstar? 
A: 10 December 1993. I was aware that vessel was chartered. Not aware if chartered by Cosco. I was aware that vessel was chartered from Goodstar. Can`t remember if I was aware of fixture note 1DB-88/89 dated 7 December 1993. 
 
Q: Nilam Antartrans (S) Pte Ltd. Broker in charter? 
A: Yes, but acting for AJ Brendon.
 Shortly after he had testified the hearing was adjourned and Suit No 420/95 was settled. He was not cross-examined by counsel for Paciro Shipping and Wee.
 30.Clause 11 of the fixture note provided: 
Bills of Lading: lst set Bs/L to state China as port of discharging. Master/crew to be informed that cargo is bound for China only. 
After vessel has left `Songkhla` port, then vessel/master will be told to divert to Singapore. 
2nd set switch Bs/L to be issued in Singapore by owner`s sub-agent against charterer`s letter of indemnity in owner`s wordings and T/T remittance of freight payment of original bank slip.
 The charterer named in the fixture note was Cosco Shipping Inc which was the buyer of the plaintiffs` cargo. Upon shipment all documentation would show that the cargo was to be carried to China but bills of lading would be switched and the vessel would sail for Singapore.
 31.I return now to Wee`s evidence in regard to the letter of 9 December 1993 he sent to Mr Lian: 
Q: Why was your agent told substitute vessel would complete voyage to China when this was untrue? 
A: Purchaser was worried agent might not co-operate with us. By `us` I mean ship owner, purchaser, salvors. 
 
Q: 1PB-281. Copy to CTIC? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Purchasers were also worried port authority might not co-operate with them, ship owner and salvors? 
A: No. Port authority was interested in getting their fees paid. 
Q: You agree that your agent at Songkhla Eastern Maritime would only be interested in getting their agency fees paid? 
A: No. Purchasers were afraid because my agent is Thai and shippers are also Thais. They were worried agent might leak information to shippers of cargo to stop loading on substitute vessel for re-shipment. 
Q: You agree that purpose of fax 1PB-281 was also to conceal fact that cargo already sold by you? 
A: No. Mr Lian (agent) was also party to contract signed with port authority on 10 December 1993. 
Q: Contract 10 December 1993 makes reference to cargo having been sold by AJ Brendon? 
A: No. 
Q: Your agent was informed by you on 10 December 1993 that cargo had been sold? 
A: Can`t recall. 
Q: 13 December 1993? When sale and purchase contracts were signed? 
A: Can`t recall. 
Q: You agree that purpose of fax sent to your agent was if cargo interests made inquiries of your agent they would be informed substitute vessel bound for China? 
A: No.
 32.Wee sold the plaintiffs` cargo. By 9 December 1993 he had done so although the sale agreements had yet to be signed. He knew a substitute vessel had been arranged. The cargo would be shipped on board this vessel. He knew it was not going to the original destination. He also knew that he had to tell his port agent at Songkhla that the substitute vessel would go to China or the port agent might not `co-operate`. Mr Lian was aware of the agreement of 10 December 1993 with CTIC but Wee could not recall if he informed him the cargo had been sold. I think he would not have told him that. That would be altogether wholly inconsistent with his letter to him on 9 December 1993 that CTIC had agreed `to release the cargoes back to [him]` to be loaded on a substitute vessel to `complete her voyage to China`. I think he did not tell Mr Lian that he had sold the cargo.
 33.The original shippers also were not to know the truth. The buyers were worried that Mr Lian would leak the information to the shippers to stop the cargo from being loaded on board the Ryong Nam San. Wee would not let the shippers know that the cargo had been sold and that it was not going to China and he would certainly not want them to know that before the Ryong Nam San had sailed with the cargo on board. He would have been much less inclined to let the plaintiffs know. I think he did not want the plaintiffs to know that he had sold the cargo. He did not want them to know it before the Ryong Nam San sailed with the plaintiffs` cargo on board. He did not want them to know that he was going to sell the cargo. He did not communicate with them for instructions to sell the cargo at any time at all and no one else did that.
 34.There are only seven plaintiffs. There was not such a large number of owners of the cargo that they could not be conveniently reached. The cargo manifest produced by Wee identified the shippers and consignees or parties to be notified. There were only 18 cargo interests covering the entire cargo shipped on board the Jambo including the plaintiffs` cargo. The average adjusters RHI had been in communication with the plaintiffs. Wee instructed Ince & Co a firm of English solicitors with an office in Singapore. In a letter dated 6 July 1993 Ince & Co said it was understood that the majority of cargo interests were insured with PICC. Wee could have communicated with the plaintiffs through the shippers or consignees or parties to be notified or through RHI or through Ince & Co or through PICC.
 35.It was not impossible to communicate with the plaintiffs or `practically impossible` or `commercially impossible` to do so. They could be `conveniently communicated with`. There was every `opportunity to consult` with them. See 
 Bowstead & Reynolds on Agency 
 (16th Ed) at p 148 rule (a) and the authorities referred to. There was no emergency and the circumstances were not such as to excuse any of the defendants from communicating with the plaintiffs for instructions to sell or otherwise dispose of the cargo. No attempt has been made to communicate with the plaintiffs for any such instructions and in my judgment the defence of agency of necessity fails.
 36.
 Liability of Paciro Shipping and Wee
Wee was the managing director of both Brendon Shipping and Paciro Shipping. He was the one who took the decision to sell the plaintiffs` cargo. He knew that the plaintiffs or the shippers of the cargo had not authorised him or either of the companies to sell the cargo. He had to arrange with Mr Lian for the cargo to be shipped on the Ryong Nam San and before the agreements for the sale of the cargo had been signed he actively concealed the truth by writing the letter to Mr Lian containing what he knew to be untrue. Brendon Shipping and Paciro Shipping both acting by Wee were parties to the agreement of 10 December 1993 with CTIC which was interdependent one on the other with the two agreements of 13 December 1993 for sale of the cargo for their performance. In my judgment each of them Paciro Shipping and Wee were liable for the conversion of the plaintiffs` cargo. See 
Wah Tat Bank Ltd & Anor v Chan Cheng Kum
 
[1975] AC 507
.
 37.There was no dispute as to the value of the plaintiffs` cargo at the time of the sale. Plaintiffs` counsel provided an estimate which appeared to be based on prices lower than the prices at which the cargo was sold. I accordingly gave judgment for the plaintiffs each for the respective value of its cargo as shown in the estimate together with interest at 6% per annum from the date of the writ to the date of judgment and costs against each of them Paciro Shipping and Wee.",1998-04-13 00:00:00,SG High Court

CHRISTOPHER LAU JC
 In this action an application had been made by the plaintiff as the representative of the estate of Madam Ng Ham Chau (Madam Ng) for orders: (i). that the third defendants, the Housing and Development Board (HDB), had been negligent in permitting the sale, following Madam Ng`s death, by Madam Ng`s husband of a HDB flat at Block 821, Jurong West Street 81, #09-488, Singapore (the flat) as its sole beneficial owner when, according to the plaintiff, Madam Ng`s joint tenancy of the flat with Madam Ng`s husband had already been severed; and
 (ii). that HDB pay one half of the flat`s sale proceeds that would otherwise have been paid by the buyer of the flat to Madam Ng, to Madam Ng`s estate.
 I dismissed the application. These are my reasons.
 2.The application concerned the use of a form of severance by Madam Ng to sever a joint tenancy and its effectiveness.
 3.The issues were: (a). in respect of unregistered land where Madam Ng had failed to comply with the statutory form of severance required by the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 Ed) (CLPA), whether HDB as a third party were entitled to treat the joint tenancy as subsisting and conduct any dealings that they might have in relation to the flat on that basis;
 (b). whether there could be a severance of a joint tenancy before the issue of the lease by HDB and before the land was brought under the provisions of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 1994 Ed) (LTA), by an instrument of declaration to sever a joint tenancy of registered land;
 (c). having regard to all the circumstances of this case, whether HDB had been negligent in approving the sale of the flat by Madam Ng`s husband to the second defendant.
 4.I set out a brief chronology, in a tabular form, of the material events : . Date Description
 20 February 1990. Madam Ng`s husband and Madam Ng agreed to lease the flat as joint tenants from HDB.
 13 January 1993. A Deed of Confirmation was entered into between the State and HDB, granting a lease of 115 years with effect from 30 January 1988.
 13 June 1994. An instrument of declaration (the instrument) as a joint tenant under the LTA was executed by Madam Ng to sever the joint tenancy.
 15 June 1994. Solicitors acting for Madam Ng enclosed a copy of the instrument to HDB and requested:
 . - HDB to notify them when the lease for the flat (the lease) was issued; or
 . - when the lease was issued to Madam Ng and Madam Ng`s husband as tenants-in-common in equal shares.
 17 June 1994. Madam Ng died.
 22 June 1994. HDB informed Madam Ng`s solicitors:
 . - HDB unable to issue lease because no certificate of title had been issued yet;
 . - HDB unable to issue as tenants-in-common in equal shares unless joint-tenancy severed prior to issue of lease.
 24 June 1994. Madam Ng`s solicitors claimed that the joint-tenancy had been severed by the Instrument and requested issue of lease issued as tenants-in-common .
 30 June 1994. HDB asked solicitors under which provision or statute the joint-tenancy had been severed.
 7 July 1994. Madam Ng`s solicitors stated any act inter vivos evincing intention to sever would suffice.

 17 February 1997. The Registry responded: if joint-tenancy, the instrument can be lodged for registration after lodgement of lease.
 19 February 1997. Madam Ng`s solicitors wrote to HDB, enclosing Registry`s letter of 17 February 1997, requested issue lease as joint-tenants so that the lease could be registered with the instrument.
 27 February 1997. HDB wrote to solicitors:
 . - Registry`s letter silent as to compliance with CLPA;
 . - Under s 53 LTA, the instrument severed joint-tenancy in respect of only registered land, that the instrument was executed before registration of land and could not be registered;
 . - asked solicitors to consider getting court order to confirm purported severance before HDB issues lease to Madam Ng`s husband.
 4 March 1997. Madam Ng`s solicitors wrote to Registry for comment on HDB`s letter of 27 February 1997.
 20 March 1997. Registry replied: instrument may be lodged after registration of lease, Registry does not vet documents.

 5.For unregistered land, s 66A(3) CLPA allows severance by: 5.1. a deed of declaration (deed) and service of a copy of the deed personally or by registered post on the other joint tenant; or
 5.2. under common law which recognises three modes of severance:
 (i). disposal of interest;
 (ii). mutual agreement; or
 (iii). by a course of dealing.
 Section 66A(4) states that upon making a deed and service thereof, the land is to be held by the tenants as tenants-in-common in respective shares.
 6.A deed is a document that is signed, sealed and delivered: see 12 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed, 1975) para 1301.
 7.The document to be considered in this case and it was the only document to be considered, was the instrument of declaration. The instrument did not conform to the requirements for a deed.
 8.Until such making of the deed, the severance of a joint tenancy of unregistered land affected only co-owners themselves qua co-owners, and third parties are entitled to treat the joint tenancy as subsisting and conduct any dealings they may have in relation to the land on that basis: see 
Diaz Priscillia v Diaz Angela
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 361
  and 
Sivakolunthu Kumarasamy v Shanmugam Nagaiah & Anor
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 341
  
[1987] SLR 182
 .
 9.In this case, at the time the instrument of declaration was made by Madam Ng as a `registered proprietor` and as a `joint tenant to sever a joint tenancy` on 13 June 1994, the land was not registered land in that it had not been brought under the provisions of the LTA, and no lease had been issued to the purchasers. The wrong form had been used. A deed should have been used instead. At best Madam Ng and Madam Ng`s husband had only an equitable interest under the agreement to lease dated 20 February 1990. Even then, the wrong form for the severance of the equitable interest, if that had been possible, had been used. Equity will not complete an incomplete gift: 
Re Fry, deceased
 
[1946] Ch 312
; 
Re Rose
 
[1952] Ch 499
. So no severance had been effected.
 10.This difficulty went to the very root of the plaintiff`s case. It was not just a question of form over substance. The plaintiff`s former solicitors had taken the position that Madam Ng could declare the instrument in escrow instead of doing a deed under the provisions of s 66(A)(3) CLPA. That was the nub of the problem because as this was unregistered land the provisions of the CLPA applied and under s 66(A)(3), only a deed and service of the deed could effect severance. Anyone being served with the deed would then have notice of the severance The instrument would only have been appropriate if the land had, at the time the instrument was signed, been brought under the provisions of the LTA. It had not been. The instrument therefore could not stand. It had no validity. Until the proper form of severance was used HDB were entitled in these circumstances, to treat the joint tenancy as subsisting and conduct any dealings that they might have in relation to the flat on that basis.
 11.The affidavit evidence showed the problem of effectiveness of the purported severance was realised as far back as 1994 by Madam Ng`s former solicitors and that in January 1995 HDB had highlighted this problem to these solicitors. They were thus put on notice. Yet nothing was done by these solicitors to address the difficulty and to correct it. They could have applied to court for the necessary orders. They did not. They could have applied for an injunction. They did not. They could have filed a caveat to protect Madam Ng`s interest. They did not. By the time therefore these proceedings were commenced in mid-1997, as the chronology of events show, there was already a fait accompli: Madam Ng`s husband, on 17 April 1997, as the surviving joint tenant had disposed of the flat. It was too late.
 12.I could not see how it could be said HDB could have been negligent in such circumstances. Madam Ng had had independent legal advice. HDB was all along open to Madam Ng`s solicitors` views, repeatedly requesting legal authorities in support of Madam Ng`s solicitors` contentions. No court order or injunction was obtained despite HDB`s entreaties. There was inactivity by the plaintiff`s solicitors from January 1995 to January 1997. No caveat was filed on her behalf as it could have been until after the flat was sold. The lease under the LTA could not be registered to Madam Ng`s husband and Madam Ng as joint tenants (so as to facilitate the lodgement of the instrument of declaration severing joint tenancy) as the right of survivorship had come into operation and Madam Ng had not executed the lease.
 13.The severance of joint tenancy affected only the co-owners themselves qua co-owners, and not third parties: 
 Diaz Priscillia v Diaz Angela 
. The plaintiff`s claim of severance, even if valid, was as between the joint tenants only and Madam Ng`s estate would be entitled to look to Madam Ng`s husband only for relief.
 14.It was in these circumstances that I dismissed the plaintiff`s application against the HDB.",1998-04-23 00:00:00,SG High Court
